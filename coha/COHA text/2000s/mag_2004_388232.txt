<p> As early as its February 20 , 2003 meeting , the VRBPAC learned that the country might face a " herald wave " virus in the fall . Beginning in January 2003 , flu viruses from China had begun showing up with signature amino-acid substitutions in their DNA . Lab tests were finding viruses with these substitutions to be less vulnerable to current vaccines . These viruses then began showing up in Europe and then North America . Because of these developments , the World Health Organization had already voted to postpone its decisions on recommending vaccine formulations . <p> At its February 20 meeting , the committee approved two components but decided to delay its decision on the one component of the vaccine that corresponded to the new variant . The scientific shorthand for that component is H3N2  --  a virus type to which the committee frequently referred that day . The H3N2 is a type of flu virus that typically causes more severe health consequences for those infected . <p> The committee delayed its decision because it anticipated receiving additional laboratory results that might firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Industry representatives told the committee that mid-March was an acceptable delay because they would still be making another of the vaccine components at that time . A decision beyond March , said the manufacturers , would definitely result in delays , even if there were no manufacturing problems . <p> In assessing its options the committee considered a number of the uncertainties involved in switching a vaccine component . A major dilemma for the committee was that it had no way of knowing how well the manufacturing for a new component would proceed . A new strain might not grow as well in eggs  --  the only FDA-approved method for making vaccine strains . According to Dr. Sam Lee of Aventis-Pasteur , the committee should consider not just the science but the manufacturing realities as well : " There 's a secondary objective that may or may not be as apparent , and that is to select strains that propagate well enough in eggs to allow manufacturers to produce vaccines needed for the U.S. market . Certainly , the best way to ensure this predictability of supply is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not always possible because we must protect the public against the circulating strains . " <p> Dr. Roland Levandowski of the FDA stated : " Our committee is charged with making the recommendation , and in itself ' , that 's why we emphasize , I think , the practical information , to try to avoid a situation where a recommendation is made that ca n't be implemented . " <p> Beyond the manufacturing issues , another risk in the process is that there is no way of knowing how much immunity any new flu vaccine will provide until after it has been produced and given to the public . There is little point to testing the flu vaccine : Being the only option in any one flu season , it must be the most efficacious . <p> Said Dr. Michael Decker of Aventis : " Everyone has to take it on faith , that the strains selected , if grown properly and inoculated , will produce the relevant antibodies and they will not only work against that strain , but they will hopefully , work against whatever circulates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time you produce it , there 's no time left to do any testing . Were there any time to do testing , there would be no time left to manufacture anything . So from the manufacturers point of view , their obligation is to produce whatever this Committee tells them to produce . Whether or not it works has to be taken on the faith that the data collected by CDC and FDA and presented to this Committee will be relevant and accurate . " <p> " We do n't really ever know , " said Levandowski , " how immunogenic any particular strain is going to be before a vaccine is manufactured , and there really is n't time to do the kind of clinical trials you would anticipate for any other kind of vaccine . " <p> Another risk in the whole process is that even if the manufacturing goes well and the final product works as anticipated , a different flu strain may become dominant after the committee makes it recommendation . One way of minimizing these risks and optimizing the immunity offered would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed or was less than ideal another would be available as a backup option . The trivalent design of the flu vaccine already does this to some extent . <p> One member of the committee , Dr. Julie Parsonnet of Stanford University , asked if it was possible to increase the number of components in each vaccine formulation , or to achieve something equivalent by having a variety of different formulations . Parsonnet pointed out some additional benefits of having multiple formulations : " You would have herd immunity and a wider variety of vaccine in the population , and also that you might have a vaccine that 's already prepared that you could use if you guessed wrong on the third virus , for instance .... " The term " herd immunity " simply means that vaccination helps protect the unvaccinated , too , by reducing the risk of spreading the disease . <p> Levandowski was skeptical : " The manufacturers themselves may want to address that concept of having different strains possibly , because if you are the manufacturer who has the strain that nobody wants , where does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't sell their product ? .... " <p> Decker said the current manufacturing capacity does not allow for fallback options : " With respect to whether companies want to offer different strains , I rather doubt it . ... You 've got one roll of the dice to make vaccine for the year . You have to start now . In fact we started a month ago , just gambling that we 've made the right choice . So by the time you know what 's the best strain , you ca n't do anything about it . " <p> A kind of halfway backup strategy would have been to begin the manufacturing process with two strains for the H3N2 component to see which could be manufactured best and then switch to that one . Several members of the committee expressed interest in this sort of strategy , but they were again told that manufacturing realities would make such a course difficult to pursue . <p> Said Decker : " When we had a problem in the year 2000 , it took several months to know that things were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be implemented this year : " I think that what would happen is that there would be an attempt  --  perhaps some production of Panama the strain that would be a backup to a new strain might go on while waiting for manufacturing strains of the new choice . Once those become available , the focus would be on using the eggs to try to make Fujian , the candidate strain to replace Panama , and only once you 've realized that it 's failed would you then abandon that and go back to making Panama . " <p> " Yes , but , " said Dr. Ed Arcuri of MedImmune , " the problem could be that could be way too late for a backup strategy of Panama to really work . " <p> " That 's right , " said Decker . " You chew up a lot of time . " <p> Limited manufacturing capacity reinforced the tight timeline . Dr. Decker told the committee : " You do n't do parallel tracks , " said Decker . " ... one manufacturing line , and you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " <p> The VRBPAC met again on March 18 to make the final recommendation on the H3N2 component of the flu vaccine . By then , the committee had additional evidence that a new variant would become dominant in the fall , and that Fujian was indicated as the best choice for the third vaccine component . However , the committee learned of an additional uncertainty involving Fujian . <p> Dr. Nancy Cox of the CDC reported the government 's labs were having no success in getting a Fujian strain to grow in hens ' eggs . The government 's labs were engaged in the preliminary work of producing a high-growth strain that would eventually be grown by the manufacturers in eggs . <p> Dr. Peter Palese suggested an alternate strategy . Fujian grown in mammalian tissue cells would subsequently grow in eggs . The problem was that , for safety reasons , the FDA had not approved of such a technique for producing vaccines . The technique of using mammalian tissue cells is considered to carry a higher risk of cross-contamination with other diseases . Eggs on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Palese believed the safety issues could be addressed , if the FDA would allow the technique . <p> Dr. Palese suggested the committee not be concerned about the regulatory hurdles but only recommend the best vaccine option . The FDA , after all , was free to ignore the committee 's recommendation in deciding which formulation to approve . " That 's sort of a decision on the FDA , " said Palese . <p> Again , the issue of backup options was discussed . This time the question was whether a supplemental vaccine might be possible if the technical issues were solved after a recommendation was made . For the same reasons that other backup strategies were not possible , a supplemental vaccine was not an option for the upcoming flu season . <p> Said Levandowski : " We had that discussion earlier in February , about what the implications of an additional strain would be . And because manufacturers currently are  --  for the amount of demand they have  --  working pretty much up until September or October to get the number of doses produced , to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever number of doses of that additional strain were produced , would take away from the total number of doses that could be made in the regular trivalent vaccine that might already be in production . " <p> With no guarantee of solving the egg problem at all , choosing Fujian meant taking a chance that there would be no H3N2 component in any of the country 's 80 million vaccine doses . Nevertheless , the committee was reluctant to recommend what it considered a second-best option . The committee was nearly unanimous in expressing misapprehension over voting to retain the Panama over the Fujian strain of flu virus type A. <p> Said Dr. Martin Myers : " I 'm very uncomfortable in that I really think we have an emerging new clave and we do n't have a seed virus . " <p> " For the first time in many years of participating in these deliberations , I must add I am very uncomfortable with that recommendation , " said Dr. Theodore Eickhoff . <p> " I vote , " said Dr. Ruth Karron , " very reluctantly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings that we hear updates about the ability to isolate appropriate A/Fujian-like viruses , so that hopefully we 're not in this position next year . " <p> " I would prefer that we move to an A/Fujian-like strain , " said Dr. Pam Diaz . " However , it seems from a regulatory standpoint and from a practical standpoint , in terms of manufacturing , we somewhat have our hands tied . " <p> The Committee Chairman , Dr. David Stephens said : " I share the majority of the committee 's reluctance about accepting A/Panama , but I really do n't think we have a choice at this point . I certainly would like to see a change , if we could do that , to A/Fujian , but that 's currently not possible . " <p> " My opinion , " said Dr. Decker , a non-voting member , " is that the ideal strain would be A/Fujian , but neither regulatory nor industrial circumstances permit us to pursue that this year . " <p> While the committee ultimately did not adopt Fujian , a number of members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that it 's really very clear , " said Dr. Gary Overturf , " that we are going to have to plan contingencies , which may include certifying other cell lines for culture to produce other strains . Because that may be necessary , because I think we 're going to have to change this next year . " <p>
