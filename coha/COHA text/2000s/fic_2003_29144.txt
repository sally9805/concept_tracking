Kingsessing , on the Schuylkill September 8th , 1810 He rode past earlier , that slip of a Sophie at his side : James . If you knew what I feel when I see him ... But why should n't you know ? If I can imagine you , not your face or your gestures perhaps but your mind and your heart , why not imagine you capable of feeling all I feel ? I picture us on the bank of the river here , near the fieldstone bench , exchanging confidences . I think how , when at last I find you , I will hand you these lines and you will know me . The aunts do not even look up as he passes . The hayfields surrounding us , north and west , belong to James ; the lush pastures to the south ; the oats and rye and cattle and sheep , the fine stand of timber between our wedge of river-front land and the ramble of the Bartrams ' botanic gardenshis , all his . He is nearing thirty , not yet married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that he 's come into his grandfather 's estate . And favored in all the other ways as well . About him there is a kind of sheen , the golden skin of good fortune . In the room below me the aunts ignore him as they work on their Manual of Geography : a book for school-girls , they have such high hopes . Lessonscomposed of questions and answers , which a classroom of girls with scraped-back hair may murmur in unison : Q. What is the climate of the Torrid Zone ? A. It is very hot . Q. What is the climate of the Frigid Zone ? A. It is very cold . Q. What is the climate of the Temperate Zone ? A. It is mild or moderate ; the heat being not so great as in the Torrid Zone , nor the cold so severe as in the Frigid Zone . Aunt Daphne , Aunt Jane . If they knew what I think . If they were to step outside and hail James , and if he were ill-mannered enough ( which he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to inquire about our unusual family , they would say they are cousins ; they are not . That they are my aunts , which they are not . Not looking at his broad shoulders , the strength of his hand on his horse 's reins ; not looking at the planes of his jaw or the shape of his brow , because they care for the minds but not the bodies of men , they would point out the charms of our small stone house . Three women , and everything just so . They would not say that I was born on a farm near Chester , to a family with two parents , two sisters , three brothers all dead of the yellow fever when I was an infant ; the surviving brother torn from my side while a few pigs and chickens wandered bewildered through the dirt . The aunts took me in , I belong to them . They think I will live here forever with them , sharing their studies , caring for them : I will not . Their book is to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What it is . From the papers and books their friends have loaned us , I am to collate the theories of rain . What will be left of all my work , after they simplify it ? Something like this , which they wrote today : Q. What surrounds the Earth ? A. The Atmosphere ; composed of air , vapor , and other gases . Q. What can you say of the Atmosphere ? A. It is thinner or less dense the further it is from the Earth . Q. When water dries up where does it go ? A. It rises into the air . Q. How can water rise into the air ? A. It is turned to vapor , and then it is lighter than the air . Q. When vapors rise and become condensed , what are they called ? A. Clouds . Anaximenes , I tell the auntsoffering this scrap much as our cat , Cassandra , brings moles to the kitchen door and lays them at my feetAnaximenes thought air might condense first to cloud , then to water , then to earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked Aunt Daphne , this : Q : Why are raindrops round ? A : One theory is this : Because the corners get rubbed off as they fall side by side . And because the round shape overcomes the resistance of the air ; and because even the smallest parts of the world are obliged to represent and mirror the round image of the universe . But the aunts are no more interested in these old theories than in the question of why Cassandra has extra toes on her paws . Aunt Daphne said , " Lavinia . When will you learn to keep in mind our audience ? " Yet why would the girls who will someday sit in a hot schoolroom , bored and weary with reciting these lessons , not feel the longings I feel ? For the tantalizing theory , the mysterious factDescartes ' assumption that water is composed of eel-shaped particles , easily separated . Urbano d'Aviso 's proposition that vapor is bubbles of water filled with fire , ascending through the air so long as it is heavier than they are ; stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally light . Why must all we write be practical ? September 13 , 1810 He comes , he goes , he comes , he goes . The other one I would tell you about : Mr. Frank Wells . He is well enough favored , tall and slim , thinning brown hair , a nose as long and sensitive as a greyhound 's . A bit older than James , with printer 's hands . He has his own business and has built a house upriver from us , which I have never seen . Unlike James he likes the way I look . He comes , he goes , along with the othersbotanists and geologists ; a Frenchman named Rafinesque , fat about the waist , whose shirt escapes from his pantaloons and shows bare flesh as he lectures us ; a shy and friendly entomologist named Thomas Say . They admire the aunts and their work and the way they have raised me . Our house of three virgins , so studious . So neat . Every hour occupied by something useful . We rise , cook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then study and study , always useful things . The aunts wear spectacles , their eyes are weary . At night they ask me to read to them . Their spirits are weary as well . Aunt Jane has spells . " It is all too much for me , " she says . April , often . Or September , like now . When everything around us is lush and damp and hot and fertile and florid . The box-hedges send out a powerful smell and the vines trying to strangle the trees send out another , even stronger ; the mockingbirds sit on the roof and sing all night ; a sound you would like , as I do . Aunt Jane takes to her bed , her skin muddy and cold and her limbs unmoving , with a cloth on her eyes and tufts of cotton blocking her ears from the bird-song . She gets sick for no reason , well for no reason . One day she rises , resumes her duties , declares that she is better . In a few months it will all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studious men , shake their heads in sympathy and whisper , Melancholia . The aunts are Quakers , and have raised me the same . On our day of rest we go to Meeting , we sit in silence , we wait with the sun streaming through the windows for the spirit to enter and move us . In that calm still place I struggle not to leap from my bench and shoutbut what is the use of talking about this , when you are not here to advise me ? What is the use ? September 24 , 1810 James again . He nods as he rides by , once more on his way to visit Sophie . The slip of a Sophie , in her house on the hill . Half my weight and half my brains and half my wit ; and a hundred times my fortune and a father , who 's a banker . Around her neck , a fine gold chain . Little rings on little fingers ; little kid shoes on little feet . James could pick her up the way I might a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not like dogs . No doubt he has lifted her lightly into a carriage , or onto a saddle . I hear she plays the piano beautifully . In the garden I watch him passing by ; I stand so he can see me and he nods . He rides on , lovely , taken . If the aunts knew what I think . If the aunts knew what I dream . Aunt Daphne has her room and Aunt Jane hers but they bundle at night in the same bedfor comfort they say , for warmthand they think I will settle for this . September 8 , September 13 ; October 1 , 2 , 3what is the point of dating these words as I write them ? They are for you , and when I find you , dates will mean nothing to us . You are in Ecuador , or in Cleveland ; in England or Boston , the Rocky Mountains ; or perhaps you are a few miles away , stripped as I was of our family name . Would n't I recognize you , though ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at the market , or passed you on the street .... I have but the faintest memory of our last day . The aunts said the plague left only us alive : a little boy , barely five years old , and me , not yet turned two . Did you cry when the wagons came ? When everything inside our home was burned , the bedding and furniture piled and torched but the things outside , uncontaminated , prudently saved and divided ? The aunts took me , some hoes and hay-rakes , two pigs , a horse , a cart . Whoever took you , said the auntsand how could they lose the name of that family who stopped on their journey to someplace else and , out of pity and charity , left with an extra , orphaned child ? whoever took you , also took the cow . On September 13 I turned twenty : I am grown and what I write is mine ; I may write whatever I want in any fashion . Wherever you areperhaps you have headed out West ? you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a glossopetra , shaped like the tongue of a man or a snake or a duck , and wondered if it rained from the sky on a moonless night . If you were here I would lift that triangular stone from your hand and say : This has nothing to do with the rain ; this is the tooth of a shark . A few times I have been alone with James . Once he arrived with a side of venison , a gift for the aunts , who were out . I was still a girl , perhaps sixteen ; I was alone in the house . He arrived without servants and would n't let me touch the meat or help him convey it to the smokehouse . As if I were a young lady , as if I had never prepared a meal or handled a bloody bundle of ribs . Even then I felt something like lightning pass between us . It has nothing to do with who we are , who we think we are ; he knows nothing of me and I know only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions : the mysterious current leaping between us comes from someplace deeper . Our bodies speaking . Or maybe our souls ; it has nothing to do with our minds . Once we met in the woods , his woods , he out marking trees for felling and I walking furiously away from the aunts , filling my lungs with air ; around me the wild profusion of tulip trees and witch hazel and honeysuckle , the beeches and myrtle and sugar maples , magnolias and pitcher plants . He asked if I was enjoying myself and when I stopped to answer I blushed and broke into a sweat , the hollows of my armpits weeping : all this from the sight of him , standing like a tree himself in the cool dark shadows . And onceit is this that wakes me at nightonce we were together a little longer . The aunts keep bees , not just for the honey but for what they represent . Our visitors are trotted out to the hives , shown their neatness and order , subjected to Aunt Daphne 's monologues about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a common goal ; how they aid and nurture each other , raise their young , store up food for the winter ; a community of females , the epitome of order . Into this model of virtue come the king-birds , who love above all else to eat bees . Once , last August , the aunts appealed to James for help and he came with a shotgun and slaughtered twenty birds . The aunts fled from the carnage , but I stayed . One bird , James said , was leading all the others ; he pointed out a beautiful creature who snapped with great determination at a line of bees returning from the clover . This bird he brought down with a single shot , then retrieved it and laid it at my feet . " May I show you something ? " he said . " You 're not frightened of blood ? " " I am not , " I said . He knelt with a penknife and slit the bird from throat to vent , plunging his hand in the craw . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking his head at their number . The sun was blazing bright , the air heavy with the scents of grass and clover ; in that syrupy atmosphere the blanket of bees began to stir . To my astonishment half of them rose like Jonah from the whale , licked clean their rumpled golden down , and flew back to their hives apparently undamaged . " All those , " he said with satisfaction . " In that single bird . " I could n't say a word . I think he knew what I felt . A cloud passed over the sun as the bees vanished into their hive ; the sky darkened and mosquitoes rose from the pond and arrowed toward us . I was looking at James , watching hypnotized as he lifted his arm and reached in my direction . Gently , firmly , he pressed his palm against my forearm , flattening the creature who had already penetrated my skin . When he lifted his hand we both stared at the streak of blood , so red against my whiteness . He was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bowed . " I am glad I could be of use to your aunts , " he said ; and then he left . I wanted to lick the blood from my arm , I wanted to lick his arm . Oh , what use is this ? Mr. Wells again today . He sat with us , we all drank tea ; the aunts showed him part of the Manual . " And Lavinia ? " he inquired . His hands on the papers were long and intelligent . " She helps with every step , " said Aunt Jane . " But also , " I said , " also I am working on something of my own . " Aunt Daphne sniffed ; Cassandra entered , bearing a grasshopper , and busied herself in tearing it apart . " What is it that interests you ? " Mr. Wells said . Which no one ever asks me . " What you would expect , " I replied , and told him what I would tell you , if you were here . " How a cloud floats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud particles form from vapor ; and how raindrops grow from those particles . Whether the winds drive the particles together , coalescing them . " He looked puzzled yet also , I thought , interested . " There are rains of manna and quails in the Bible , " he said . " And in Pliny the Elder , rains of milk and blood and birds and wool . " What I wanted to say was this : It was raining the day they took us from each other . Q. What kind of rain ? A. A light rain , a drizzling rain . Q. You remember that ? A. It is almost all I remember . On the muddy ground our household burns without flame , the smoke rising up through the fine rain falling down . You have no face . Your figure , clad in damp homespun , disappears into a Cloud . What I said was , " Rains of fish . " The aunts , who do n't remember the rain , have no idea what asking me to collate these theories has meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks , " I continued . " But almost everyone agrees that those result from whirlwinds . " Mr. Wells bent down to Cassandra , meaning I think to rescue the grasshopper ; too late , she had left nothing but the wings . He straightened with these in his right hand . " Rains of stone , " he said , augmenting our list . " Do you know the theory of the lapidifying juice ? " Aunt Daphne struggled to maintain the expression of deferential interest she feels is proper with such men . " Through the earth 's crust moves a fluid body , or juice , that can turn various substances into stone , " said Mr. Wells , nodding in the aunts ' direction but addressing me . Really his face is very kind , almost handsome in its own way . His linen is clean , his hands as well ; but on the middle finger of his right hand is a callus always stained with ink . " it is also found in the sea , and in the atmosphere , in a gaseous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body . In the air this lapidifying juice makes pebbles , which fall to earth . " " I have never heard of this , " I said . " A sixteenth-century theory , " he said , setting down the broken wings . " An attempt to account for the generation of stones , and a distinct advance on the theory of the petrific seed . " Another phrase I had never heard . The aunts turned the conversation toward their textbook before Mr. Wells could finish his thought , but later I was able to thank him for teaching me something new . " It 's nothing , " he said . " Do you investigate the theories of snow and hail and dew , as well as rain ? " When I told him I was interested in all the hydrometeors , he made me spell and define the word . " It 's just as you would expect , " I said . " If meteor is any atmospheric phenomenonthink of meteorologyso we speak of the aerial meteors , or the winds ; the luminous meteors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery meteors , such as lightning and shooting stars . Among the watery or hydrometeors are all those things you mentioned . " " Now we have made a fair trade , " he said . " You have taught me something new . " He is kind enough , smart enough . If you were here , would you tell me what to do ? Q. What is it I feel for James ? Q. What is it James feels for me ? Q. What theory accounts for these feelings , which can come to nothing ? Q. What ? In the garden Mr. Wells held out a sheaf of papers . " From my Charleston cousin , William Wells , " he said . " He practices medicine in London now , and in his spare time studies nature . He is writing an essay on the dew . " Perhaps you are in London as well , perhaps you are leading the life I long for , rich in friends and good conversation , the universe unfolding before you . I smoothed my skirts against the bench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about dew as rain that falls very slowly , particles of water moving toward the objects that attract them . He stuttered and looked down at his lap , at the papers in his lap . " Does dew come from the earth , or from the air ? " he read from his cousin 's notes . " Does it rise or fall ? What is the source of the cold that condenses the vapor ? At first I thought that the deposition of the dew might cause the cold we observe on those objects . But I have come to realize that the cold precedes the dew . " He turned to another page . " My cousin did an experiment , " he said . " Which we might try to repeat . " We gathered uncarded wool from the aunts ' stores , and on the balance they use to weigh mordants and pigments for dyeing , we weighed out two equal amounts . One sample we spread in a loose circle on the grass . Inside a long , thick-walled piece of clay drainage pipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkening sky , we spread the other sample in a circle the same size . The aunts watched , unimpressed but polite . They have borrowed many books from Mr. Wells . " I 'll return in the morning , " he said . " Quite early , if you do n't mind . " When the aunts did n't offer him a bed , he rode off to his own home . The legs of his horse disappeared in the mist , then the horse 's head , and then his own , leaving only the silver rays of the moon and the clear , cold air . Aunt Daphne made me come inside but then she and Aunt Jane kept me awake , arguing in the fierce , airy whispers they think I ca n't hear through the wall between our rooms . Their words were lost but not their tone and I knew they had settled into their favorite topic : Q. What shall we do with Lavinia ? A. Is there an answer to this ? I slept , and dreamed of you . In the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as his cousin had found , the sample out on the grass had collected more dew . " Which it would not , " I said , " if dew fell from the sky like rain ; an equal amount should have fallen within the cylinder as without . " " My cousin 's point exactly , " said Mr. Wells . " He contends that the cooling of the earth 's surface causes water vapor to condense from the air . What matters is how much heat is radiated into the atmosphere . What matters is the exposure of the objects on the surface to the air . The sheltering walls of the drainage pipe lessened the radiation to the sky ; it was colder outside the pipe than within , hence there was more dew outside . " My skirt was wet , our hands and arms were drenched , there was damp wool everywhere and the smell of sheep . " Ill borrow some thermometers from my friends , " he said . " We 'll set them around and see if the dew is heaviest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , pointing out a sheltered hollow and a promising rise , I caught him looking at me . I forget sometimes how long my limbs are , how fleshy I am in the shoulders and bust . You are built the same , I expect , tall and strong and capable , like James . Mr. Wells looked me over shyly and said , " Forgive me , I do n't mean to stare . But you have such amplitude . You are very different from your aunts in this way . " They are not my aunts , I wanted to say . Instead I reached over to brush off the bits of wool on his coat , which caused him to color up to the roots of his soft brown hair . A rain that moves in swirls and gusts , pushing the leaves against the limbs , pushing my hair away from my face ; then a rain hardly more than a mist , seeming simply to condense on my skin : it is raining today . And although you disappeared in the rain , perhaps because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain . In it I am sleek and slender and smooth , attractive as Sophie is attractive , a woman someone might love . The wide span of my hips reduced , the thick mat between my legs tamed and trimmed and my monthly bleeding dried to a few dainty dropsoh , forgive me for these thoughts . You will know what I mean by them . Out of the rain stepped James . Behind him his wagon , and on it two boxes : two solid , well-made wooden hives . Gifts for the aunts . But once more they were absent . " I thought they might like to enlarge their apiary , " James said . When I told him they had gone to consult with a printer about their book , he murmured something about their industriousness . " A pleasure , " he said . He smelled of wood and wool and leather harness , of honey , and himself . " To have such neighbors . " " I 'm sure they 'll be grateful , " I replied . He nodded and stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boxes and hauling it past the barn and the sheds , to join the others among the apple trees . A second trip and he was done , back before me , sweat slipping down beneath his heavy hair . He did not refuse the glass of water I offered . He drank slowly , steadily , the muscles moving in waves beneath the smooth skin of his throat . After he passed me the empty glass , he stepped back . " Why are you looking at me like that ? " he asked . " There is something , " I said faintly . " A little spot of something , on your cheekbone . " The gesture with which he raised his handindex and little fingers spread , ring and middle fingers together , the whole strong shapely hand displayedwas that of a beautiful woman . Two fingertips brushed his cheekbone , where I would place my tongue . He knew that , knew there was nothing to brush away but a few drops of sweat . That was pity passing over his face , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just a little , at being so sharply admired . He started to say something , stopped , shook his head , and left . I can not have James . This is perfectly clear . In my mind I know he belongs to Sophie and I accept this , I understand it . In my mind . Still my heart lags behind . Though even if my heart wants to be broken , if part of me wants to be brought to my knees , it is not to be my choice . For James I will never be more than one of the three virgins he passes daily . The aunts have no idea of this , but it is from the likes of James that they have wished to preserve me . From that giving in , that going under , they would preserve me as they 've preserved themselves . Not the children born every year , half or more of them to die ; not the daily bowing down , the loss of my own thoughts and my independence ; not the loss of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the loss of that clear separate place in me where I dream of you , and long for you . Through that channel of longing , the world enters me . Yesterday Mr. Wells took me to visit our elderly neighbor , William Bartram who has grown so reclusive . We 've met before ; when I was a girl , still in short skirts with my hair in a braid , the aunts occasionally trotted me over to him . Great man , they said , introducing him to me . Then me to him : Our niece , whom we are raising . She is very studious . A few questions they would put to me , so Mr. Bartram might see how well I answered . After those I was expected to be silent .
