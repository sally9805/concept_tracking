When my father returned from service as an Army doctor in Korea in 1953 , he brought back slides of the photos he 'd shot , showing a war-torn country of incredible poverty . We would have laughed if you had told us that Americans would one day buy Korean cars . But 50-some years later , South Korea has the 13th-largest economy in the world , and you see Hyundais and Kias everywhere in America . Looking at things in microtime frames is not always a reliable guide to the macrotime-frame future . So it may turn out to be with Iraq . We have been looking at Iraq in microtime frames  --  or , for many who oppose the war , frozen in the time frame of late 2006 . A better picture of the microtime frame is that we have achieved considerable success this year . " The trend toward better security is indisputable , " writes the Associated Press . U.S. military and civilian deaths have declined sharply . Anbar province is pacified , Iraqis are streaming back to Baghdad , and al Qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Klein , a critic of the administration , admits the gains and advises Democrats not to try to cut off funds . Conservative columnist Tony Blankley claims " a very real expectation that next year the world may see a genuine , old-fashioned victory in the Iraq war . " American media are presenting less reporting from Iraq , partly because some in the media believe that good news in Iraq is not news . Some Democratic congressional leaders still maintain that the surge strategy has made no difference , and they seek a vote on troop withdrawal . But Democratic presidential candidates , more closely attuned perhaps to changes in events and opinion , are talking less about withdrawing from Iraq and more about what we should do ( or should not do ) about Iran . Hopeful signs . Let 's look , however , not just at the microtime frame but the macrotime frame . Yes , violence could re-escalate , as Klein predicts . But within sight is a far more hopeful trajectory . In the long run of history , our involvement in Iraq is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quagmire and a more unstable Middle East . Remember that in early 2005 the successful initial invasion and the specter of a possibly democratic Iraq prompted Libya 's Muammar Qadhafi to give up his weapons of mass destruction and Syria to withdraw troops in the face of the " cedar revolution " in Lebanon . The increasing violence in Iraq in late 2005 and all of 2006 was accompanied by the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip , the increasing menace of Iran , Syria 's continued bullying of Lebanon , and other dire developments . There was similar back-and-forth in Korea : Communists nearly driving the United States off the peninsula , then the successful Inchon landing and push to the Yalu River boundary with China , then the Chinese counteroffensive that resulted in a stalemate roughly along the 38th parallel . Each of those developments suggested a very different future trajectory ; the one that turned out to be lasting was the maintenance of a non-Communist South Korea that over several decades became first prosperous and then democratic . That example gave impetus to similar developments in east Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and market economics reminiscent of 1970s South Korea . Harry Truman was regarded as a failed president , with job ratings below George W. Bush 's . But the long-term verdict on his Korea policy is much more positive . An Iraq that is reasonably stable , fairly democratic , more prosperous and productive than the Middle Eastern standard : This seems to be at least one possible trajectory from the success of the surge . That would be a considerable achievement , with positive reverberations for decades to come . In time the back-and-forth between victory , then rout , then acceptable but incomplete success that we saw in Korea  --  the microtime frames that seemed so important at the time  --  was mostly forgotten . And the qualified but substantial progress achieved in the macrotime frame , in Korea and in the dangerous region around it , dominated our view . We have now some basis to hope that something similar happens in Iraq and the dangerous region around it . We are still far from the " broad , sunlit uplands " that Winston Churchill pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we seem to be getting closer .
