" Mr. Steele , your two o'clock appointment has arrived . " Morgan Steele 's pulse immediately kicked up a notch with his secretary 's announcement . He inhaled deeply and deliberately cleared his mind of everything except the woman who was about to walk into his office . Helena Spears . " Give me a few minutes , Linda , before sending her in . " " Yes , sir . " After clicking off the line he stood and threw the papers he 'd been reading into his briefcase before snapping it shut and inwardly telling himself to relax . Getting Helena to his office had been the first hurdle , and he was determined to make it over the rest . He was smart enough to know that if at first you do n't succeed you try again , and today he was a man with a more defined plan . Putting his briefcase aside he found himself glancing toward the door , his pulse kicking up another notch as he remembered the night -- a little more than a year ago -- when he had first seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy fuchsia-colored dress . There had been something about her entrance that had momentarily taken his breath away , left him awestruck , mesmerized . And moments later when he had gazed into the warmth of her cinnamon-brown eyes , he had felt it . It had happened just the way he 'd known it would once he found her -- the perfect woman he had been holding out for all these years . The only thing that had n't happened as he 'd assumed itwould was her acceptance . Lena , as she was known to her family and friends , was n't seeing things quite his way . She 'd tried to explain to him , in a nice way and more than once , that she was n't interested in a man-woman relationship of any kind . She liked her life just the way it was and had no intentions of wasting her time indulging in a meaningless affair . Nor , she 'd gone further on to add , was she interested in a meaningful one , either . She had been there , done that , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a repeat . All that was well and good but she was n't dealing with any regular man . At thirty-three he could admit to being arrogant , methodical and unwilling to bend in his pursuit of anything . Once he saw something he wanted and made a decision to have it , he refused to give up until he got it . And the bottom line was that he wanted Lena . He had wasted enough time and starting today he intended to use a different approach . He glanced toward the door again when he heard the sound of the knob turning . The moment it opened and his " perfect " woman walked in he could n't help but release a breath . He felt the sizzle as heat shimmered all through him . She was wearing a periwinkle-color business suit and she looked good in it . " Lena , please come in , " he said cordially as his gaze floated over the rest of her with an analytical eye . She had just the right amount of makeup on her strikingly attractive medium brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flowed around her shoulders , giving her the appearance of a Queen Latifah look-alike . She was five feet ten , just the right height for his six-three stature . Her body was stacked , well endowed in all the right places , full breasts , wide child-bearing hips , voluptuous thighs and the most gorgeous pair of shapely legs he 'd ever seen on a woman . He 'd once overheard a conversation she 'd had with his sister-in-law Kylie , who happened to be her best friend , about what she thought was a weight problem . As far as he was concerned , she did n't have one . When he looked at her , what he saw was a full-figured , thirty-one-year-old attractive and desirable woman who could start anything and everything inside him to stirring . The woman was temptation at its finest ; however , when it came to her he was prodded to look beyond temptation and see something a lot more lucrative and worthwhile . Little did she know but he intended to open up a whole new world for the both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , closing the door behind her , and breaking into his thoughts . " I 'm here for our two o'clock appointment . " From the sound of things she intended to be all business , and that was okay for now . He would give her this time because in the coming weeks he intended to get his . She would find out soon enough that she had just walked into a " Steele cage " and there was no way out . He had failed at plan A , but he had just put plan B into full motion . Lena pressed her lips firmly together as she looked across the room at the man leaning against his desk . Morgan Steele . She thought the same thing now that she did that night she 'd first met him . He had to be the most gorgeous human male to grace this planet , which prompted her to put her guard up even more . The last thing she needed in her life was a man , especially one like Morgan . She 'd learned her lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty boys " and " fine as a dime " men , she had to watch her step . But still ... although she tried not to stare but could n't help herself . She 'd been attracted to him from the first . Maybe it was the beautiful coloring of his skin , which reminded her of deep rich chocolate . Or it could have been the long lashes and dark eyes . And heaven forbid if she left out the chiseled jaw , high cheekbones , low-cut black hair and a pair of lips that were too provocative to be attached to any mouth . The first night they 'd met he 'd surprised her by coming on to her and asking her out . She had turned him down flat . To this day she really did n't know why he 'd bothered since men who looked like him did n't go for Amazons . They were usually seen with the slim , willowy , model types . Evidently , once she 'd turned him down he 'd seen her as a challenge and had asked her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline . Finally , she had felt the need to put an end to whatever game he was playing by explaining her position on dating to him . She was too caught up in other things she considered more important than to be added to another man 's list as his flavor for the month . As with any potential client she had done her research , which really had n't been necessary since Morgan 's oldest brother , Chance , had married her best friend , Kylie , over a year ago . Besides , most people who 'd lived in these parts for a relatively long period of time knew about those four Steele brothers who ran their family business , the Steele Corporation . Chance at thirty-seven was CEO . Sebastian Steele , nicknamed Bas , who had gotten married just a few weeks ago , was thirty-five and the corporation 's problem solver and troubleshooter . Morgan was thirty-three and headed the research and development department of the company ; and Donovan , at thirty-one , headed the product development division . Then there were the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of PR . The other two , Taylor and Cheyenne , had established careers outside of the family business but maintained positions on the board of directors . " May I offer you something to drink , Lena ? Springwater , juice , coffee ? " Morgan 's question pulled her thoughts back in and she licked her suddenly dry lips and tightened her hand on her briefcase as if it were her block of strength . " No , thanks , " she said , moving closer into the room . " And since you 're a busy man I 'm sure you want us to get right down to business . " " Yes , I prefer that we do since I have another meeting in about an hour . " She nodded , glad they were on one accord . She had n't known what to expect when he 'd set up the appointment . From past encounters she assumed he was a laid-back sort of guy . It was refreshing to know he could be strictly business when the situation called for it . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started ? " he asked , pushing away from the desk and pulling her thoughts back on track . " Yes , thanks , " she said , forcing the words out from a constricted throat . He was dressed in a business suit that made him look like he belonged on the cover of an issue of Sexy Man magazine . She took the seat in front of his desk , and as soon as she sat down she noted once she tilted her head up she had a direct aim to his face , specifically his let-me-seduce-you dark eyes . A sensuous shiver glided down her spine when their eyes met . She cleared her throat , determined to stay on track . " I understand you 're interested in purchasing another home , " she said to get the conversation going . " Yes , I am and you come highly recommended . " She could n't help the smile that curved her lips . " By Kylie ? " He chuckled . " Yes , her too , but I would expect that since she 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your praises has been Jocelyn . According to her , you found her and Bas the perfect house . "
