<p> UNITED CEO IS WORTH HIS PAY <p> Editor  --  Is Glenn Tilton guilty of something ? Has he committed a crime in accepting a fair compensation package ? ( " No sacrifice in store for CEO of United , " Lazarus at Large , Dec. 6 ) <p> Tilton has a rare skill set , as you note , one that commands a premium . His skills are valued fairly by a board that sees his abilities as the best way to turn around an ailing company . That board would n't pay one penny in undeserved compensation to a new CEO . Not when they 're bleeding seven times Tilton 's annual salary every day . <p> You mourn the workers losing their jobs in the face of Tilton 's salary . What about all the people who will still have jobs in two more years because Tilton is being paid fairly to make difficult decisions ? If you were in their shoes , would you trust anyone less qualified to make those decisions ? <p> Also , that quote from ( Scott ) Klinger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he 'd go without pay . " If we held our leaders to this asinine standard and relied on human altruism and not on the concept of fair compensation for personal effort , planes would stop flying , lights would go out and we 'd all be living in a Third World country . <p> JEFF PENNINGTON <p> San Francisco <p> TELEMARKETERS  --  <p> 3 STRIKES AND A HIT <p> Editor  --  During World Series week I was plagued with a rush of those pesky telemarketing calls ( " Telemarketer fun  --  no end in sight yet , " Lazarus at Large , Nov. 24 ) . During one game when the Giants were giving me an anxiety attack I decided I needed a diversion . So when the calls started , I answered the phone , " Baseball Central , how may I direct your call ? " <p> I got the following results : <p>  --  " Is this a business ? " <p>  --  A hang up . <p>  --  Dead silence , followed by a soft voice saying , " I think I have the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on his toes . His response : " Home plate , please ! <p> By the time the calls stopped the Giants were again doing well . Sorry to say it was n't game six ! <p> ANN JENNINGS <p> Albany <p> TURN THE TABLES <p> ON TELEMARKETERS <p> Editor  --  To deal effectively with telemarketers ( " Telemarketer fun  --  no end in sight yet , " Lazarus at Large , Nov. 24 ) , you have to steal from them the thing they value most and contributes to their livelihood  --  time . <p> Here 's an effective method ( from an actual conversation ) : <p> Caller : " Hello , Mr. Veerpaul , I 'm calling to tell you you 've won a five-day vacation at Royal Turkey Resorts . How does that sound ? " <p> Me : " Sounds great . When can I go ? " <p> Caller : " Well , do you have your calendar handy ? " <p> Me : " Just a minute . I 'll get it . This really sound great ! Hang on . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; simply put the phone down . After five minutes , pick it up and do everything you can to inspire confidence in the teletrickster that this is a sale-in-the-making and say , " I 'm still looking . Boy this is great ! Hang on . " ( " Hang on " is critical script dialogue ) . <p> Do this at continuously increasing intervals  --  8 , 10 , 12 minutes , until the phone goes dead . Eighteen minutes is my personal best . I 'm hoping to improve with coaching and practice . Not only am I having fun at the expense of someone truly offensive , but saving probably hundreds of unknown good citizens from similar dinnertime interruptions . Reward enough . <p> JERRY VORPAHL <p> Foster City <p> STAND SAFELY <p> BEHIND THE SCREEN <p> Editor  --  Our simple solution to telemarketing calls ( " Telemarketer fun  --  no end in sight yet , " Lazarus at Large , Nov. 24 ) is to screen all our calls . The telephone rings , we wait , the machine answers , we wait . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows . If we want to talk , we pick up . <p> Everyone we know is aware that we always screen , so they alert us if it is them . With this method , we have never had a successful telemarketing call in the past several years . The only time we have spoken with a telemarketer is on the rare occasion when we inadvertently answer the telephone , defeating our own system . <p> FRANK J. MARONE <p> San Francisco <p> PAC BELL DOES N'T <p> SEEM TO KNOW ' NO ' <p> Editor  --  Like a lot of people ( " The devil 's in phone bill details , " Lazarus at Large , Nov. 28 ) , I almost missed realizing what was in the little notice I got from Pac Bell a few weeks ago . However , I caught it in time and responded by sending in the reply card and requesting that they " restrict their use of my CPNI , " as they like to call it . <p> A few days later , I decided to go one step further and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After initially trying to get me to change my mind , the customer service representative capitulated and processed my request . Then , only seconds after I had asked her to put me on a list of people who had asked not to be bothered with marketing pitches , she asked me if I would take a moment with her while she reviewed my account and made some suggestions about Pac Bell services that I might be interested in . <p> They do n't seem to get it  --  or maybe they do n't care . I am tired of having to carefully inspect my mail these days to make sure I do n't miss something sneaky that too many companies today are trying to slide by me . <p> J. SCOTT GILLETTE <p> Lafayette <p> WHAT MCI <p> DOES N'T TELL YOU <p> Editor  --  I read your article about MCI price hikes ( " Some MCI fees to rise , " Nov. 22 ) . I just signed up for MCI 's neighborhood plan for all three of my phone lines . The primary line is $49.99 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get free caller ID , call waiting and phone message service . <p> I thought it was a great deal because I had been using Pacific Bell for local calling and AT &T; for long distance and had separate charges for those features . <p> It made financial sense until I found out that only the primary phone line gets the unlimited local and long-distance calls . The other two lines get only unlimited local calls and no extra features . <p> I thought that was OK because I do n't need the features on all my lines and I 'd be sure to use my primary line for long distance . <p> Then I got my first bill . MCI neglected to tell me that it adds a $6 surcharge for network access on the primary line and $7 for each additional line . That is an extra $20 a month for me . <p> Because the surcharge is called a surcharge , it 's not considered part of the monthly fee even though it is added monthly . <p> I will be switching back to AT &T; soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DWARFS TAX SAVINGS <p> Editor  --  Thank you for your continuing exposure of the energy fraud perpetrated upon the citizens of California by those who should now be in jail ( " How PUC sold out public , saved utilities , " Lazarus at Large , Nov. 10 ) . <p> I am now paying , in one year , a surcharge on my electric bill that amounts to about four times my tax savings granted last year by the Bush administration . Had it insisted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do its job in regulating energy prices , as it should have done , that surcharge would be either nonexistent or much lower . <p> H. R. MERHOFF <p> Red Bluff , Tehama County <p> OTHER COUNTRIES ' <p> ABUSES IGNORED <p> Editor  --  It seems Rainbow Grocery has joined a growing list of anti-Semitic , hypocritical businesses choosing to punish Israel while simultaneously ignoring the human-rights abuses of countless other countries ( " Middle East unrest hits grocery store , " Dec. 4 ) . <p> Will Rainbow be pulling products from China , a country that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees stop buying gasoline made from Iraqi and Saudi oil ? Surely , they ca n't approve of Saddam Hussein torturing his own people . <p> To single out Israeli products is anti-Semitic . If Rainbow employees wish to protest oppression , they need to remove products from every country guilty of the crimes they accuse Israel of committing . The same is true of the Divestment Resource Center of San Francisco , which targets only Israel . <p> KATHY HALLGREN <p> San Francisco <p> BOYCOTT IS RULE <p> BY PERSONAL WHIM <p> Editor  --  After reading the initial coverage in The Chronicle ( " Middle East unrest hits grocery store , " Dec. 4 ) , I made the mistake of visiting Rainbow Grocery to politely lodge a complaint against their policy on Israeli goods . <p> I was told by the staff at the front counter that I did n't know enough about the Middle East and Israel 's behavior . One of the workers actually asked me if I had heard of Noam Chomsky and insisted on writing down an URL ( zmag.org ) for me to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him that I knew Chomsky well , he smiled condescendingly and told me to go read the articles anyway . <p> Thanks for the excellent coverage and please stay on this issue . In addition to the sociopolitical intrigue , it is a fascinating study in what happens when a company decentralizes control and focus to the point where the organization is composed of autonomous cells who are free to bring down the entire organization on ignorant personal whim . <p> DUNCAN HABERLY <p> San Francisco <p> ADVICE ON MAC <p> A LOSS TO PAPER <p> Editor  --  I will miss David Einstein 's computer info column . He is very talented and did a very fine job answering questions . <p> OLIVETTA CHAVEZ <p> Concord <p> END OF EINSTEIN <p> DIFFICULT TO COMPUTE <p> Editor  --  David Einstein 's final column ( Computing Q &A,; Nov. 25 ) struck fear in the minds and hearts of tens of thousands of us who looked forward each week to his tips . <p> Good luck , David ! And please find a replacement . <p> BOB NESS <p> Oakland <p> SUV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  With all the drumbeating and saber rattling in this country , I feel that folks should consider it their patriotic duty to pay whatever it costs to support the coming war ( " Iraq war could hit at pump , " Nov. 20 )  --  but especially the owners of large trucks and SUVs . Of course , I 'm being sarcastic and kidding , kind of . <p> And I have to confess that we drive an electric car , so . . . <p> BOB KAMPMANN <p> Sacramento
