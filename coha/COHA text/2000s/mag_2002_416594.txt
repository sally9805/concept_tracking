Section : MEDICINE AND MONEY <p> Overworked doctors . Bankrupt hospitals . Thousands of unnecessary deaths . <p> Exactly what you 'd expect in a country whose health care ranks below that of Colombia , of Morocco , of Costa Rica . <p> That country ? You 're living in it <p> TODD TAYLOR , M.D. , DOES N'T WASTE ANY time when he comes banging through the emergency-room doors at the start of each shift . If he did , he 'd be distributing body bags instead of bandages . <p> " There can be 30 to 50 patients waiting , so I have to find the worst cases and dive right in , " says Dr. Taylor , a burly 45-year-old with a receding hairline , thick eyebrows , and rugged features . " I 'll examine them in the hallway , in the waiting room , in the bathroom  --  just making sure everyone will stay alive . " <p> This kind of Hail Mary health care is common for a MASH unit in a combat zone-except Dr. Taylor works far from firelights , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him tell it , he and the rest of the nation 's E.R. docs are on the front lines of another kind of war : the battle to practice quality medicine as America 's health-care system falls apart . <p> " Most Americans still have no idea how dangerous it has become to be ill or injured and end up in an emergency room at the wrong time , " says Dr. Taylor , who doubles as vice president for public affairs at the Arizona College of Emergency Physicians . " The chance of surviving a heart attack now depends more on the time of day , the day of the week , and your type of insurance than any other factor " During a recent medical conference , Dr. Taylor asked an audience of doctors if they 'd had firsthand experience of patients dying as a result of crowded E.R 's . One by one , about half the hands in the room went up . <p> This is n't just stressed-out griping from an overworked E.R. doc . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it comes to keeping ourselves healthy , the United States does n't even make the WHO 's top-10 list of countries . In fact , we 're barely in the top 40 . <p> Based on our health system 's responsiveness to the needs of the population , the cost of health care to the individual , allocation of public and private funds , overall population health , and the ratio between the current state of our health and the state that could be achieved , the United States limps in at 37th , far behind first-place France and second-place Italy . By those standards , you 'd get better cradle-to-grave care in Podunk-y pit stops like Luxembourg ( 16th ) and Morocco ( 29th ) . <p> Morocco ? What the hell is going on ? Are n't we the richest , most advanced nation on the planet ? Are n't our doctors the miracle workers , the artificial-heart inventors , the perennial Nobel laureates ? Then why are we only slightly better off than Cuba ( 39th ) ? We 're actually worse , in one sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , but nearly 40 million Americans do n't have health insurance , meaning they receive virtually no health care at all  --  or have to crowd E.R. 's and hope for the best . <p> " They do n't have health insurance , or it wo n't cover the procedures " Dr. Taylor explains . " They hope by some miracle we can help them in the emergency room . There 's sometimes nothing he can do , but by law he has to at least make sure they have no immediate life-threatening problems . All the while , other patients can be stuck for up to 2 hours in an ambulance , waiting for an open E.R. gurney . <p> Whatever the cause , the overcrowding of emergency rooms has placed hospitals across the country in a bind between compassion and compensation : E.R. 's have to treat everyone who 's seeking care , but they 're reimbursed only a fixed fee by Medicare and managed-care plans . <p> " Emergency medicine is an essential public service with no funding source , " says Gary Tamkin , M.D. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American College of Emergency Physicians . Last year , emergency-room doctors in California delivered $110 million in unpaid care . <p> That 's a major reason why hospitals are laying off staff , going into bankruptcy , and closing . Two-thirds of the hospitals in Massachusetts are running a deficit , while nationwide , 128 general acute-care hospitals closed in 1999 and 2000 . The direct result ? Dangerously overworked E.R. physicians . Doctors , especially residents , are often forced to extend their work hours from an already grueling 80 per week to 90 , 100 , even no . The effect , say medical researchers , is a level of sleep deprivation comparable to chugging five beers : Staying awake for 24 hours impairs psychomotor performance to a point comparable to a 0.1 percent blood-alcohol level , according to a study published in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine . Put it this way : How 'd you like your doctor to cannonball a six-pack before opening you up and operating ? <p> " That 's why we all make errors , " says one first-year medical student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a mistake . But we cover them up . There 's no push to change . " <p> Dr. Taylor does n't pull day-and-a-half shifts . He made a deal with his colleagues at Phoenix 's Good Samaritan Hospital that he would work every Friday and Saturday night  --  the busiest time for E.R. 's  --  in exchange for weekdays off . By the time Dr. Taylor 's shift ends at 7 A.M. , there are often patients still waiting to be seen . " I look at them and wonder how desperate they must be , " he says . " Sitting all night , suffering . ! ca n't believe it when they thank me  --  until I find out they already waited at another E.R. for several hours or called their primary-care doctors and were told they could n't be seen for a week . " <p> THE SEARCH FOR A CULPRIT in the American health-care crisis leads from the emergency room back to the family medical practice . E.R. 's are dangerously overcrowded not only because of the masses of sick and uninsured , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " family doctors . " According to a recent American Medical Association report , 20 percent fewer graduating med students entered family-practice residencies in 2000 than in 1996 . As a result , people are turning more and more to the emergency room for all their primary-care needs . <p> That 's why if one thing can put a smile on the face of every E.R. doctor in the country , and possibly even boost the United States toward the top of the WHO rankings , it 's the promise that a few thousand medical students are about to become primary-care physicians . <p> David Grande , M.D. , is just the kind of guy they have in mind . He 's a youthful-looking 28-year-old who often bustles around in a skateboarder 's green sweater and cargo pants , a stethoscope slung around his neck . He 's insanely hardworking and would probably be the star of any medical practice  --  except he 's decided not to work in one . <p> " It 's a very hard decision to make , especially after borrowing so much money for medical school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in a health-care system that does n't work without trying to make a change . " The way he sees it , American medicine has become a money pit that will keep falling apart no matter how many millions are dumped into it . The time has come , he 's convinced , to tear the structure down and rebuild from the bottom up . To back up his conviction , he 's forgone a big-bucks medical specialty to become something more valuable : a primary-care physician who only makes house calls . <p> Today , he 's in North Philadelphia 's infamous " Badlands " Here , amid the neighborhood gangstas , crack addicts , and heroin dealers , Dr. Grande and his fellow volunteers are setting up shop inside a secondhand mobile home that 's been converted into a crude mobile medical truck . Soon , they 'll begin treating any wounded , diseased , or delirious person who stumbles in off the street . <p> It 's not long before a line forms . A pregnant young woman comes in with a fever ; an older woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geriatric pries off his tattered construction boot and reveals toes that have swollen into fat , pus-filled grapes . Last week , a diabetic who could n't afford insulin turned up with blood-sugar readings that were off the chart ; Dr. Grande sped over to a nearby drugstore and bought him a prescription out of his own pocket . <p> " Our supplies here are really limited " Dr. Grande shrugs . " We depend on donations , so sometimes we need to supplement on our own . " More than 60 percent of the people treated here have no insurance , and many others are senior citizens whose ailments have progressed past the point of an easy fix because their health plan does n't subsidize their medication . <p> The problem is n't that our country lacks the cash . Already , the United States 's annual tab for health care is over $1.3 trillion  --  not only way more than any other country 's , but also more than that of some of the higher-ranked countries combined . " The American health-care system is at once the most expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New England Journal of Medicine noted in 1999 . Sure , our nation has some of the most respected and innovative medical specialists in the world and more state-of-the-art gizmos than almost any other nation on the planet . In fact , when it comes to the availability of such high-tech gadgetry as MRIs and CAT scans , the United States is second only to Japan . <p> But where we pour a huge amount of that $1.3 trillion into developing superadvanced technology , Japan focuses as much on primary care as it does on miracle cures . The results are unmistakable : According to the WHO , Japanese men have the longest life expectancy on the planet  --  74.5 years  --  while American men can expect to die nearly a half decade sooner . That may not mean much to you right now , but ask your 69-year-old father what he thinks . <p> " What the World Health Organization ranking points out is that it 's not important how much you spend " explains Dr. Grande , " as opposed to where you spend it " While we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their budgets are balanced on revenues from radical procedures , instead of the early diagnosis and preventive care that would make them unnecessary . Even Fidel Castro puts more into primary care than we do : Los cubanos have one generalist per 255 people , while we americanos have only one for every 430 . We 're becoming the world 's best firefighters , in other words , while the rest of the world just keeps its oily rags away from the stove . <p> Med-school students learn the lesson early on in their education : Specialists get rich . " That 's a very powerful draw when you 've taken out a fortune in loans and have to figure out a way to pay them back " says Amy MacKenzie , a first-year medical student at the Drexel University college of medicine who now has to decide her future . The difference in pay is dramatic : According to a 2001 compensation survey by Modern Healthcare , pediatricians and primary-care doctors make $156,000 a year on average , while cardiologists and urologists , for instance , earn about $277,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might seem simple . All we have to do is pay generalists more , and in no time we 'll have empty E.R. 's , well-rested residents , and longer life spans than any other country . But of course it is n't that simple , and you can spell the reason with just three letters : H ... M ... <p> Care to buy a vowel ? <p> HMO 'S HAVE A NICKNAME for primary-care physicians : They call them " gatekeepers " The way managed care works , general practitioners are a critical first obstacle to a patient 's request for specialized  --  read " expensive "  --  medical care . Without that magic referral slip , there 's no chance an HMO will cover a consultation with a high-priced specialist . The result is a huge disincentive for a reed student to become a primary-care physician : Succumb to HMO pressure and your patient will want to sue you , but appease the patient and you 're relegated to HMO hell  --  no insurance payments . <p> " Given a choice between saving money and saving your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Linda Peeno , M.D. , lobs the question up there , inviting you to think the worst of the health-care industry . But before giving way to cynicism , you have to ask the question : Are managed-care executives really that cutthroat ? <p> " Absolutely " replies Dr. Peeno . " Without a doubt . " As a former medical reviewer for Humana , one of the nation 's largest publicly traded managed-health-care companies , she should know . <p> As a medical reviewer , Dr. Peeno scrutinized doctors ' medical requests and either accepted them for reimbursement or denied them as unnecessary or not covered by the patient 's plan . Her duties went further , however ; whenever possible , Dr. Peeno says , she was supposed to cajole or bully doctors into avoiding pricey procedures . " Intimidation , hassling , humiliation  --  I did it all , " Dr. Peeno says . It 's hard to believe , coming from a petite Kentuckian whose bluegrass drawl makes her sound like a schoolmarm , but that 's what made her perfect for the job : She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another part of Dr. Peeno 's job was to consult with marketing executives to find ways to " monkey with the language " as she puts it , so the plan would appear to promise one thing , while preserving loopholes for denial of care . She got so caught up in the challenge of cost-cutting , she says , that it became " like a game " in which she tried to find any possible reason to deny payment . <p> But even when the necessary treatments are approved , doctors say , they 're being pushed too hard to speed patients along . More than 2,000 Massachusetts physicians published a call to action in the Journal of the American Medical Association , complaining that they were being forced to treat patients like parts on an assembly line . " The time we are allowed to spend with the sick shrinks under the pressure to increase throughput " they charged . " Doctors and nurses are being prodded by threats and bribes to abdicate allegiance to patients , and to shun the sickest , who may be unprofitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ruthless when it comes to wielding incentives and punishments . If the doctors demand too many expensive procedures , they say , they risk being dropped by the insurer . If they minimize care , however , they receive bonuses . State medical societies in California , Georgia , and Texas have gone so far as to accuse the insurance industry of Mafia-style practices . Backed by more than 75,000 physicians , they recently filed a federal lawsuit that says that denying necessary medical care is tantamount to racketeering , and that paying doctors to limit tests and treatments is unfair business . <p> Dr. Peeno saw it all , and played along . But in 1987 , one case jolted her so badly , it haunts her to this day . A patient in California , she says , had been scheduled for a heart transplant . While Dr. Peeno was reviewing the case , one of her colleagues dropped by . " Someone came in my office and said , ' Have you called yet about this case ? We ca n't pay for this . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a contract , and we 've got to figure out a way not to pay for it . ' " Dr. Peeno wavered , and rationalized , and finally stamped the request " Not Medically Necessary . " <p> Because the decision saved Humana about $500,000 , Dr. Peeno says , she was given a raise and promoted . She was also stricken with self-loathing . She quit Humana and went to work for another HMO , and then another , thinking each one might be different . Nothing changed . " I always had the same task " Dr. Peeno says . " Using my medical expertise for the financial benefit of the organization , often leading to great harm , and potentially death , for some patients . " <p> While Humana has stated that Dr. Peeno was never in a position to be the final arbiter of any medical , healthcare , or insurance matter , copies of her work contract with Humana indicate otherwise . The company also said it could find no record of the foiled transplant patient she describes . But Dr. Peeno passionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out the patient 's fate , preferring to hide the truth from herself as long as possible . But 12 years later , spurred by Humana 's steadfast denial of the case , she tracked down the patient 's death certificate . He had died 28 months after the benefit denial without receiving the transplant . Dr. Peeno 's medical expertise tells her he lived out his days in end-stage heart failure . " I live with that act , and many others , eating into my heart and soul , " Dr. Peeno says . " A physician 's basic rule is , Do no harm . I did worse . I caused death . " <p> BUT HMO 'S ARE VICTIMS , TOO , one doctor contends : victims of bad timing . Just look at their customers . <p> " Let 's face it , this is a terrible time in history to be responsible for American health " says Frederick deBeer , M.D. , chief of medicine at Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Lexington , Kentucky . " We see patients every day who neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer . Then they expect a miracle cure to drag them back from the portals of death . <p> " And then they want it regardless of the cost ! " Dr. deBeer concludes indignantly , his South African accent punctuating his point that this is an American phenomenon . Dr. deBeer was raised and trained in the United Kingdom and South Africa , and since coming to the United States has been consistently amazed at how little attention Americans pay to their health . Poor access to primary care may contribute to men 's neglect of their health , or it may be the other way around-perhaps the fact that men do n't bother getting checkups has made primary care less lucrative for doctors . Dr. deBeer ca n't say which is cause and which is effect , but in his budget-monitoring capacity as the chief of medicine at a major veterans ' hospital , he 's certain of this : The failure of Americans to take responsibility for their health has contributed significantly to the country 's health-care problems . <p> " Everyone complains about how expensive health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deBeer explains . " Many Americans live their lives with little regard for the consequences , then go to specialists for what are , essentially , very expensive end-of-life procedures " As examples , he points to the ever-increasing obesity rate and never-increasing blood-pressure exams . " It 's so well established that men in their 30s need annual blood-pressure exams , but we 've failed miserably in convincing them to get them " he says . " Then they have a stroke , and the cost to keep them alive is far more than it would have been for 10 lifetimes ' worth of early care . " <p> In this regard , Dr. deBeer says , HMOs are n't completely at fault for hiring screeners to dissuade patients from relying on specialists . Where they are to blame , however , is in allowing these decision-makers to become both intimidators and a money-sucking entity of their own . By trying to save money , HMOs have created massive administrative machinery that costs as much to run as the hospitals . On average , administrative costs in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than double the administrative costs in Canada , which manages to provide universal health care while holding the bureaucratic overhead at 11 percent . <p> " As managed-care enrollment has soared , so have administrative expenses " says Steffie Woolhandler , M.D. , an associate professor of medicine at Harvard University and cofounder of Physicians for a National Health Program . " The percentage of workers in the health system dealing with paperwork has increased from 18 percent to nearly 30 percent , belying the myth of HMO efficiency . " <p> AMERICA 'S HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM is bloated and bleeding , and it 's just been wheeled into the trauma unit . You 're the doctor . What do you do ? Pump more money into the nation 's emergency rooms ? Odds are , patient loads will continue to outpace funding due to the paucity of primary-care physicians . Bring the salaries of family doctors more in line with those of specialists ? It 'll still be a thankless job as long as HMOs continue to pit primary-care physician against patient . So overhaul the HMOs ? Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insurance , most Americans do n't receive the early preventive care they need . <p> The only way to effectively stabilize the patient may be a phrase we do n't want to hear : national health insurance , better known as " socialized medicine " There are dozens of reform plans , but most share the same core philosophy : High profits and healing can not coexist . Nearly all propose using tax dollars to finance health care for every citizen , taking medicine out of the hands of for-profit companies . <p> Although governments control health care in nearly every other first-world nation ( including most of those ranked higher than the United States in health-care performance ) , Americans are unrelenting in their opposition to so-called socialized medicine . The HMOs are against it , naturally , and so are the overwhelming majority of physicians , particularly the specialists , who fear that their salaries will be capped at bus-driver levels . But , more important , the American public has never accepted the idea . This is partly because of its " commie menace " ring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be as incompetent and crushingly bureaucratic as , say , the Department of Motor Vehicles . <p> " But there 's no reason it has to be that way , " says Dr. Grande , the crusading young doctor who 's hoping to champion just such a radical health-care overhaul . " There are all kinds of national systems , and if the right one is created , it can be far more beneficial  --  and cost effective  --  than most for-profit businesses " After all , we do it with the military , public education , and trash collection  --  why not medicine ? <p> Perhaps because , in practice , socialized medicine improves the health of the overall population , but shortchanges the individual who truly needs that expensive specialist . Just look across the border . In one national poll , eight in 10 Canadians said they believe that their country 's much-extolled cover-everyone health system is in crisis . That 's why ( among other reasons ) any such program considered for the United States would need to give every citizen the option of paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of the sort used for charter-school programs . Even then , proponents of socialized medicine will have an extraordinarily difficult time selling it as a cure-all for our ailing health-care system . <p> Dr. Woolhandler , for one , makes a more pragmatic argument : " How much worse could it get ? " HOW YOU CAN HELP SAVE THE SYSTEM <p> Our health-care system is listing  --  badly . So what are you going to do ? Swim to Morocco ? No , you 're going to start bailing . Here are five ways you can help right the ship . <p> 1 . CHOOSE A PRIMARY-CARE PHYSICIAN : This is the family doctor you stopped seeing when you grew up and decided you knew bet only when they 're banged up , but if they come in for regular checkups , I can catch minor problems before they manifest in larger ways , " says Richard Roberts , M.D. , chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians . " Regular checkups " means every other year in your 40s and 50s , and yearly from age 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at **29;1805;TOOLONG to check the credentials of primary-care physicians in your area . HELP SAVE THE SYSTEM <p> 2 . QUIZ YOUR HMO : Call your HMO and pose these two questions : " Do you provide any financial incentives to any of your physicians to limit diagnostic tests and referrals to specialists ? " and " If a particular medical treatment is turned down , is there an appeal process ? " The correct answers are " No " and " Yes . " HELP SAVE THE SYSTEM <p> 3 . OR SKIP THE HMO 'S ENTIRELY : One alternative is a " defined contribution , " which provides $1,000 a year ( $2,000 for families ) to use in whatever way you want for your health care . What you do n't spend stays in an account . Another grand is added annually . And , since $1,000 wo n't go far for a serious illness , most plans have catastrophic coverage that takes effect $500 after your account runs out . " Forty-three percent of company benefit managers have interest in consumer-driven programs , and they 'll soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America 's Choice Healthplans , a defined-contribution provider . HELP SAVE THE SYSTEM <p> 4 . KNOW THREE NUMBERS : Your ratio of LDL ( bad ) cholesterol to HDL ( good ) cholesterol . Your blood pressure . And your body-mass index ( BMI ) . Keep them within the ideal ranges  --  less than 100 for LDL and over 45 for HDL cholesterol , over 80 for BP , 19 to 24 for BMI  --  and you may never need this number : 911 . " The key is making this part of your routine , " says Bill Williams , M.D. , president of the National Association of Managed Care Physicians . Hit the blood-pressure station in your local drugstore , calculate your BMI at www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi , and check your LDL-to-HDL ratio with the Biosafe home test ( www.drugstore.com ) .
