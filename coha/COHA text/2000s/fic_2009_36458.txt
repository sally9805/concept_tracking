The cruiser 's strobes cast red and blue light onto winter dead trees . Officer T.J. Banks pulled the car onto the shoulder and flipped on the spotlight , running the beam along the edge of the field where corn stalks shivered in the cold . Twenty yards away , six Jersey cows stood in the bar ditch , chewing their cud . <p> " Stupid fuckin ' cows , " he muttered . Besides chickens , they had to be the dumbest animals on earth . <p> He hit the radio . " Dispatch , this is forty- seven . " <p> " What 's up , T.J. ? " asked Mona , the night dispatcher . <p> " I got a 10- 54 . Stutz 's damn cows are out again . " <p> " That 's the second time in a week . " <p> " Always on my shift , too . " <p> " So what are you going to do ? He ai n't got no phone out there . " <p> A glance at the clock on the dash told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to stand out here in the frickin ' cold and round up these stupid shits . " <p> " Maybe you ought to just shoot ' em . " <p> " Do n't tempt me . " Looking around , he sighed . Livestock on the road at this hour was an accident waiting to happen . If someone came around the curve too fast it could be bad . He thought of all the paperwork an accident would entail and shook his head . " I 'll set up some flares then go drag his Amish ass out of bed . " <p> " Let me know if you need backup . " She snickered . <p> Yanking the zipper of his coat up to his chin , he slid his flashlight from its nest beside the seat and got out of the cruiser . It was so cold he could feel his nose hairs freezing . His boots crunched through snow as he made his way to the bar ditch , his breaths puffing out in front of him . He hated the graveyard shift almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashlight beam along the fence line . Sure enough , twenty feet away two strands of barbed wire had come loose from a gnarled locust- wood post . Hoofprints told him several head had discovered the opening and ventured onto the shoulder for some illicit grazing . <p> " Stupid fuckin ' cows . " <p> T.J. went back to the cruiser and popped the trunk . Removing two flares , he set them up on the centerline to warn traffic . He was on his way back to the cruiser when he spotted something in the snow on the opposite side of the road . Curious , he crossed to it . A solitary woman 's shoe lay on the shoulder . Judging from its condition and lack of snow cover , it had n't been there long . Teenagers , probably . This deserted stretch of road was a favorite place to smoke dope and have sex . They were almost as stupid as cows . <p> Frowning , T.J. nudged the shoe with his foot . That was when he noticed the drag marks , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced the path with the flashlight beam , tracking it to the fence and into the field beyond . The hairs at the back of his neck prickled when he spotted blood . A lot of it . <p> " What the hell ? " <p> He followed the trail into the ditch where yellow grass poked up through the snow . He climbed the fence and found more blood on the other side , stark and black against pristine white . It was enough to give a guy the willies . <p> The path took him to a stand of bare- branched hedge apple trees at the edge of a cornfield . He could hear himself breathing hard , the dead corn stalks whispering all around . T.J. set his hand on his revolver and swept the beam in a 360- degree circle . That was when he noticed the object in the snow . <p> At first he thought an animal had been hit and dragged itself there to die . But as he neared , the beam revealed something else . Pale flesh . A shock of darkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adrenaline kicked hard in his gut . " Holy shit . " <p> For an instant he could n't move . He could n't stop looking at the dark circle of blood and colorless flesh . Giving himself a hard mental shake , T.J. dropped to his knees beside the body . His first thought was that she might still be alive . Brushing at the snow , he set his hand against a bare shoulder . Her skin was ice cold , but he rolled her over anyway . He saw more blood and pasty flesh and glazed eyes that seemed to stare right at him . <p> Shaken , he scrambled back . His hand trembled as he grappled for his lapel mike . " Dispatch ! This is forty- seven ! " <p> " What now , T.J ? One of them cows chase you up a tree ? " <p> " I got a fuckin ' body here at Stutz 's place . " <p> " What ? " <p> They used the ten- code system in Painters Mill , but for the life of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd never had to use it . " I said I got a dead body . " <p> " I heard you the first time . " But the words were followed by a stunned pause as realization hit her . " What 's your twenty ? " <p> " Dog Leg Road , just south of the covered bridge . " <p> A beat of silence . " Who is it ? " <p> Everyone knew everyone in Paint ers Mill , but he 'd never seen this woman before . " I do n't know . A woman . Naked as the day she came into this world and deader than Elvis . " <p> " A wreck or what ? " <p> " This was no accident . " Setting his hand on the butt of his .38 , T.J. scanned the shadows within the trees . He could feel his heart beating fast in his chest . " You 'd better call the chief , Mona . I think we got us a murder . " <p> Excerpted from Sworn To Silence by Linda Castillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Martin 's
