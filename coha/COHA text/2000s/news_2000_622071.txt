<p> Having met , at my swing-dance class this spring , a man who appears to possess all the makings of a great partner , off the dance floor as well as on , it seemed pretty clear when I contemplated the perfect summer day question that I 'd want to spend my perfect summer day with him . I have to add that while all the activities described in the scenario I 'm laying out here are eminently doable , it may be slightly unrealistic to fit them all in over the course of a single day . But we 're talking about a dream day . Meaning that a certain element of fantasy exists here . The one part I know for sure is , there will be dancing . <p> My partner Dennis and I start our day with a breakfast that will keep our energy level high without weighting us down . I might be likely to cook up a bowl of oatmeal and serve it on my deck , overlooking Mount Tam . That way I know I 'll get real maple syrup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawberries will be organic . <p> But if I had to choose a commercial breakfast establishment here in our stomping grounds , it would be the Half Day Cafe in Kentfield , or the Dipsea Cafe in Mill Valley . If we were n't about to dance , I 'd be hard-pressed to pass up the cornmeal pancakes with banana at the Half Day . As it is , I 'll go for fresh-squeezed juice , fresh fruit and yogurt . Dennis may feel the urge to lift me overhead . <p> We are still new enough to this dancing stuff that we tend to forget some of the fine points of our routines between classes . So for our perfect day , we 've lined up our teacher , Stephanie Moore , to come to my home for a private lesson . If our lesson focuses on swing , she 'll give us a showoff move like the one we 've been working on recently , in which Dennis gets down on one knee just long enough for me to sit down on the other one , kick both feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is , Stephanie explained to us , the kind of move you execute only once an evening . ) <p> After an hour 's refresher course , we 're feeling ready to head out into the world and show our stuff . Our destination is Villa Montalvo in Saratoga  --  not officially a dancing establishment at all , of course , but a terrific venue for outdoor music of all sorts , including Latin and swing . <p> The drive to Saratoga from Marin County may take an hour and a half , but it 's a great ride , especially if you favor Highway 1 . I may pick up a piece of fish , straight off the boat , in Half Moon Bay and throw it in the cooler for later . One place I never miss anytime I 'm on this stretch of Highway 1 is at the Davenport Cafe in the town of Davenport about 10 miles north of Santa Cruz . Whether or not you stop for a meal , pick up a loaf of their great bread for later . <p> Another stop we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakville Grocery in Los Gatos so we can assemble the makings of a picnic to bring to the concert . If we arrive with time to spare , we 'll set out on one of the Villa 's several miles of hiking trails or wander around the gardens checking out the sculptures there before setting ourselves up on the lawn for the show . <p> As always , the Montalvo lineup for this summer features artists from all musical worlds , but for the purposes of this particular dream day , let 's suppose I 've got a pair of tickets ( as , in fact , I do ) for an afternoon of salsa with Latin music queen Celia Cruz . <p> Technically , performances at Montalvo are sit-down affairs . But one of the great things about attending outdoor music events like this one is that it leaves you the flexibility to get up and dance if the spirit moves you , as it more than likely will . Fresh from our morning dance class , of course , there is no question that Dennis and I will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we can have room to show off all the moves Stephanie has taught us . <p> A serious swing or salsa dancer would never think of dancing on the grass , of course . But nobody , watching us , is likely to mistake us for serious . What we forfeit in finesse , however , by dancing outdoors at Villa Montalvo , we recoup in atmosphere . <p> The great thing about an evening show at Montalvo is getting to see the stars . ( I 'm speaking of the constellations , not the per formers . ) If you ca n't be up and dancing to terrific live music , the next best thing I can imagine is lying back as you listen , studying the night sky . <p> But for Dennis and me , attending an afternoon show , the perfect summer day might continue afterward with a drive to the mountains north of Santa Cruz for dinner at a wonderful , funky little restaurant called Ciao Bella ( Italian , obviously ) , where you can dine outdoors in a natural circle of redwood trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere hard to top . <p> Then again , if we 're still full from our picnic , which is highly likely , after the show we may just choose to continue driving down the coast to Carmel  --  one of my favorite stretches of coastline . I know of people for whom Carmel signifies shopping and browsing in art galleries , and of course , for many , the town is all about golf . <p> As for me , my favorite thing about Carmel is the unlikely and little-known fact that the wonderful stretch of beach here remains among the few within easy range of San Francisco where it remains legal to camp overnight . I love it that it is still possible to roll out one 's sleeping bag for free under the same stars and wake to the very same view , same surf , same sunrise , that a person who 's plunked down a few million bucks for a piece of waterfront property gets . <p> If you leave your afternoon show at Villa Montalvo by a quarter to 7 , you could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be uncorking a bottle of chilled champagne just as the sun drops into the ocean . The first time Dennis and I camped on the beach here , the night air was just cool enough that we thought we 'd build ourselves a fire . ( Good idea , too , if a few hours back you chose to pick up a piece of fresh fish along the coast at Pillar Point Harbor in El Granada near Half Moon Bay . Douse your fish with a little champagne and maybe a few fresh herbs , stick it in a grilling basket , unwrap your Davenport Cafe bread ,  --  and I 'd say you 've got dinner . ) <p> No problem if you make it to the beach just before sunset . Last time we camped on the beach at Carmel it took us just a few minutes gathering the necessary wood for our fire . For mysterious reasons , there seemed to be an unusual profusion of half-burnt pieces of wood scattered on the sand , which helped enormously in the swift construction of what was , within minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to sleep shortly after 10 o'clock ( that salsa dancing can take it out of a person ) when we were roused by the sound of a four-wheeler moving unmistakably in our direction . Sure enough , it was a Carmel beach patrolman , come to inform us ( but in the friendliest manner ) that all fires must be extinguished by 10 p.m . Looking at our watches we saw it was 10:01 and swiftly obeyed  --  realizing , as we did so , the reason why there were so many pieces of half-burnt driftwood on this particular stretch of beach . No problem . We got our sunset . We got our bonfire . Eight hours later , we would wake to the sound of surf , and after a freshening-up stop at the public bathroom at the beach ( the pleasanter ones being those just south of the main beach and not the facilities at the foot of Ocean Avenue ) . <p> Then we make our way into town , like any other Carmel visitor , ( looking for all the world no different than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &B;  --  just more invigorated ) for breakfast at Katy 's Place  --  where the pancakes are great even though the maple syrup comes , as the menu informs us , from Illinois . <p> Although this marks the completion of a pretty darned near perfect 24 hours in my book , I feel a need to add that I wo n't be leaving Carmel without a dip in the ocean , regardless of temperature . Some people might  --  at least in their fantasies  --  top things off with a round of golf at Pebble Beach , too . But as for Dennis and me , if you deposited the two of us on the 18th hole , we 'd rather be dancing . <p> JOYCE MAYNARD 'S DAY <p> Here 's how to re-create the writer 's perfect day . <p> VILLA MONTALVO : 15400 Montalvo Road off Highway 9 , Saratoga ; Celia Cruz will perform August 6 , Brian Setzer Orchestra will be there August 9 , ( 408 ) 961-5858 for the complete program <p> OAKVILLE GROCERY : 50 University Ave. , Los Gatos , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulevard , 5-11 p.m .
