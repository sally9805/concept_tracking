Elnora Caldwell was always clear about what she wanted . And after a turbulent marriage , she wanted nothing to do with Robert Woods . <p> The 46-year-old Oakland woman , a Nordstrom employee in downtown San Francisco known for her impeccable appearance , served Woods with divorce papers several weeks ago , relatives said , and filed for a restraining order . She told her landlord , " I kicked him to the curb . " <p> But police said Woods , a burly weight lifter who once worked for the city of Oakland , did not leave his estranged wife alone . <p> Woods fatally stabbed her Saturday evening in his black pickup and pushed her out on a road just off Highway 24 near the Orinda side of the Caldecott Tunnel in front of stunned motorists , authorities said . <p> While motorists stopped to offer aid to the critically injured woman , one driver followed Woods and jotted down his license plate number . <p> Woods drove to Caldwell 's apartment near Oakland 's Lake Merritt , said Caldwell 's 21-year-old son .

The son at that time did n't know his mother had been killed . <p> On Sunday , Contra Costa County sheriff 's deputies found and arrested Woods , 47 , on suspicion of murder . He was being held in county jail on $1 million bail . <p> Caldwell 's death prompted waves of grief on Sunday . Among those mourning were the people who had tried to revive her as she lay bleeding near the tunnel , colleagues who worked with the bra fitter at the lingerie department at Nordstrom , and members of her large family , who gathered in her living room under a framed photograph of a sunset . <p> " He took my sister 's life for no reason , just because she did n't want to be with him , " said Cathy Jenkins , 42 , of Tracy . She added , " How do you come back to her own house and wash her blood off ? " <p> Caldwell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ruston , La. , one of 10 siblings .

In recent years , relatives said , a stroke robbed her of some of her motor skills ; she needed help , for instance , hanging up panties on hangers at her job . <p> She had been with Woods for more than a dozen years and got married a few years ago in Nevada , relatives said . The couple lived together at times , and lived apart at other times , even during their marriage . A former neighbor of Caldwell at her last apartment , also in Oakland , recalled that Woods had punched a hole in a hallway wall during an argument . <p> By many accounts , the relationship was once stronger . Kathy Sack , the lingerie manager at Nordstrom , said Woods would sometimes bring flowers to his wife or take her to lunch . <p> But Caldwell 's brother , 44-year-old Roy Jenkins of Alameda , said she had caught her husband cheating . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister by personally serving the divorce papers and the domestic violence restraining order on Woods at his East Oakland doorstep . <p> " He said , ' Oh , your sister is really serious ?

" <p> Jenkins and other family members said Woods continued to contactCaldwell , calling her and driving by her house . A few weeks ago , they said , he tried to break the lock off her front door , an incident that they said was reported to Oakland police , who were unavailable Sunday for comment . <p> Family members said they could not figure out how Caldwell ended up in the GMC truck . <p> " She would n't have went nowhere with him , " said her mother , Susie Gissendiner , who on Sunday was trying to book a plane flight from Louisiana to Oakland . <p> The Contra Costa County Sheriff 's Department , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an altercation in the truck at about 6:20 p.m . Saturday . It is not clear where they were coming from , but sheriff 's spokesman Jimmy Lee said Woods pulled over at Fish Ranch Road on the east end of the tunnel . <p> What happened next shocked Martin Reed , a 44-year-old Kensington resident who was using Fish Ranch Road to drive home from a party with his sister and her child . He said the truck was on a stretch of road that passes over Highway 24 . <p> " We came around the corner and I saw a black pickup truck in the street and a woman kind of fall or stumble out of it , " Reed said . " She collapsed in the street . " <p> He said his partner and his neighbor , who were in another car , pulled up and started asking the truck driver questions - but the driver sped off with one witness in pursuit . <p> In the next several minutes , Reed said , 10 to 15 motorists stopped to help , with many calling 911 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have neck and chest wounds - in an effort to keep her alive . <p> Reed said he asked Caldwell for her name . <p> " I thought she said Norma , " he said .

" <p> Caldwell was soon taken by paramedics to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek , where she was pronounced dead . <p> " I 've never seen anything like that in my life , " Reed said . " We tried to tell ourselves that at least she had people around her when she died . But her death was horrible . This poor woman died in the street . " <p> Over in Oakland , Caldwell 's son , 21-year-old Nolan Lewis , arrived at his mother 's apartment on Lee Street just before 7 p.m. to grab a jacket and pay a quick visit .

" He said , ' Your mom 's down the street . " <p> Lewis said he followed Woods back down to the truck , then picked up a chair and smashed a window . He said Woods cursed at him , raised his middle finger and drove off . <p> Broken glass and pieces of the chair still littered the driveway on Sunday . Blood remained on the knob of the apartment 's front door .
