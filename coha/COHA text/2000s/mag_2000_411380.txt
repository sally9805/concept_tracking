They came of age during the era of World lX/ar i , flying machines and silent movies . Now , Henry Ford Museum brings this first generation to life in its " Your Place In Time " exhibit . // Are you a " Progressive " ? To find out , ask yourself , " What do the words Teddy Roosevelt , Model T Ford , World War I , silent movies , flying machines , electric streetcars and Babe Ruth mean to me ? " If your first mental images are just faded photographs of Gibson girls and doughboys then the answer is probably " no . " But if you recollect cranking a Tin Lizzie on a cold morning , you might just be part of the first generation to come of age in the 20th century-a real Progressive . The Progressive generation is one of the stars of a new exhibit at Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn , Mich. , called " Your Place In Time : 20th Century America . " A collaboration between the museum and POPULAR MECHANICS , the exhibit brings six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds , events and technologies that each one created , and that in turn shaped them and generations to come . In April , we gave you an overview of the exhibit ( see " Your Place in Time , " April 2000 , page 93 ) . This month we take a closer look at the century 's first generation during its members ' young adult years . Generation Stats Born : 1890 to 1919 Photograph Photograph // Number of births : 48,224,000 Nickname : Progressives Mottoes : " Votes for women , " " Speak softly and carry a big stick . " The Progressive generation understood that change was in the air-and on the ground . As youngsters , their imaginations were captured by the new flying machines , by Ford 's affordable automobiles , by the artistic and journalistic possibilities of moving pictures and inexpensive cameras , and by the opportunity to use telephones and electricity in the home and the workplace . In immersive vignettes , the exhibition brings into vivid relief a few of the era 's technologies that had an enormous impact on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A-U-T-O In the 1920s , a Midwestern resident commented to a sociologist , " Why on Earth do you need to study what 's changing this country ? I can tell you what 's happening in just four letters : A-U-T-O ! " In the exhibit , you can climb into one of those automotive change agents-a large , stylish 1917 Overland touring car-and imagine what a Sunday drive must have been like in those early days . If your imagination needs some assistance , a large billboard captures the automotive dreams of the era . It shows a woman at the wheel of her car , headed down " The Road to Happiness " toward a city skyline that looks a little like a cross between Oz and present-day Detroit . Are we there yet ? Winding Up In 1906 , the Victor Talking Machine Company introduced the Victrola , a record machine that you had to wind up . Soon , no middleclass home was complete without one . In the exhibition , visitors can select from a wide mix of early recordings-from Italian arias and Mexican folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flappers ' favorite dance tunes , all sounding just like they did on the old hand-cranked machines . But for many years after the turn of the century , the success of a song was still measured by sheet music sales . A sheaf of sheet music seems to pour out of the Victrola 's speaker in the exhibition . Looking at some of the popular titles , you might think the Progressive generation had a collective stutter : " Toot-Toot-Tootsie " and " No No Nanette " are among the colorful covers . Crank it up .

And you 're right . But it was also the nickname given to early movie theaters . Most were small rooms with folding chairs and a canvas screen , where short , silent films were shown to the accompaniment of live music for an admission price of , well , a nickel . You can go into the " Electric Theater " and see the daily bill-with such features as " The Great Train Robbery " and " A Race For A Kiss . " The films are silent , but the exhibition includes audio of the piano player , the audience cheering for the hero and booing the villain in a variety of languages that might have been heard in a typical urban , immigrant neighborhood where these theaters were found . Between the audio track and the occasional text placard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " Mystery Science Theater 3000 . " Where 's the popcorn ? Painful Gains This generation , as much as it believed in progress , also experienced the dark side of technological change . New machines meant new and often dangerous workplaces . Workers-many of them children-struggled for recognition , living wages and safer conditions . New systems of packaging and distribution made available food and meditine from distant sources , but it was difficult to know their ingredients , let alone their quality . New technologies also meant new and horrible ways of waging war , as amply demonstrated in the Great War , now known as World War I. But rather than abandon new technologies , many members of this generation worked to establish laws , organize unions , reform business practices and generally clean up capitalism 's acthence the " Progressive " label . So next time you go to work , eat packaged food or read a medicine label , remember the contributions of the Progressive generation .

Photograph Advertisements suggested using the Victrola for dance parties . Talking Machine Journal reported in 1923 , " If it were not for the flapper , the Victor people might as well go out of business . They buy ninety percent of the records . " Photograph The popularity of the Victrola meant new markets for many kinds of music , and the birth of the recording industry . Photograph This 1917 ad showed automobiles making an easy trip between country and city , foreshadowing the rapid growth of suburbs .
