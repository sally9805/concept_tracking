<p> The stockbrokers , planners and insurance salesmen who used to peddle tax shelters have a new grift : charity . Some of their donation schemes work , some are shaky and some are downright dangerous to your finances . <p> <p> WHEN MAURY WERNESS , a 68-year-old retired Navy pilot and math teacher , faced a big capital gains tax bill last year , an estate planner near his Chandler , Ariz. home offered a novel solution : Werness could offset the gain by donating a rental house he owned to New Life Corp . of America , a charity . <p> As Werness and his planner explained it to FORBES , Werness would get two things in return : ten years of monthly annuity payments from a reputable charity and a tax deduction for the full amount the charity netted from selling the house . As a bonus , he could direct part of his gift to his Lutheran church . " It 's a win-win situation , " gushed Werness , who deeded the house to New Life in December . <p> Sorry , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of other taxpayers . Capitalizing on Americans ' generosity and aversion to taxes , an army of middlemen is on the loose , peddling complex and sometimes very shaky schemes for charitable gifts . These middlemen are , in some cases , the same sort of folks who used to sell cattle partnerships and railcar leases as tax shelters . Cattle and railcar deals died . Now strange charitable trusts and devices are filling the vacuum . <p> The charity hustlers are urging investors to buy into complex strategies that often involve irrevocable commitments that play out over a long time . Their pitch is that you can use the tax code 's breaks for charity both to do good for others and to do well for yourself . <p> Can you ? Up to a point , yes . If you 're careful , you can get lots of mileage from your donations . ( See related story , p. 165 . ) But if you are n't , you can either suffer unpleasant investment surprises or get a nasty bill for back taxes and interest . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes a deduction for the full value of the house ; the law dictates that he must reduce the deduction by the value of the annuity . Worse , lawsuits have raised disturbing questions about New Life , and the way it pays planners a commission on client donations may violate federal securities laws . Because Werness ' annuity is n't reinsured by an insurance company , serious trouble for New Life could threaten his ten-year payout ( see box , p. 184 ) . <p> Win-win ? Probably not . The middleman wins , but Werness gets less than he bargained for . <p> Congress has always allowed generous tax breaks to encourage giving . But once upon a time , strategies were tailored to fit a wealthy donor 's individual needs , usually by lawyers or a charity 's " planned giving " specialist . Now they are being packaged and sold like TV dinners . And where once charitable plans were primarily about giving , they are now being promoted as tax shelters and investment products  --  by insurance salesmen , stockbrokers , financial planners , lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable targets , can benefit enormously from planned giving . Cleveland real estate developer Robert R. Risman , 71 , is one such donor . He recently signed on to a plan that is designed to divert tens of millions of dollars in estate tax from Uncle Sam into his own foundation  --  at a cost to his children 's inheritance of just pennies on the dollar ( see box , p. 186 ) . <p> Younger folks such as Santa Rosa , Calif. telecom entrepreneur Warren Linney , 39 , can win , too . Linney is using a remainder trust , among other techniques , to maximize deductions and provide financial flexibility ( see box , p. 188 ) . <p> The trouble , says attorney Stephen Nill , a giving specialist in Rancho Santa Margarita , Calif. , is that as competition intensifies , charitable schemes are becoming more tenuous . They are also being sold further down the wealth scale , where they often make less sense . <p> A survey of 700 financial planners in March found 44% planning to emphasize charitable strategies , up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explode , and financial advisers are going to drive it more than nonprofits , " says Russ Allan Prince , the market researcher in Shelton , Conn. who did the survey . <p> Though some of the most active promoters are marginal outfits , big financial institutions such as Merrill Lynch and American Express are in the game as well . They smell big money : Internal Revenue Service figures show more than $60 billion in charitable remainder trusts in 1997 , double the total in 1994 . Citigroup 's Salomon Smith Barney says it 's opening nearly twice as many new charitable trusts this year as last . <p> It 's easy to see the appeal of donation plans to the middlemen : With commissions squeezed by on-line outfits and other low-cost competitors , brokers and insurance agents are casting about for new products to sell . When sold by insurance agents , charitable plans often involve buying life insurance or variable annuities . They also have a long revenue tail : With many trusts set to run for 20 years or more , sellers can look forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , these products are so complex and involve so many variables  --  life span , tax rates , market performance , interest rates  --  that they 're almost impossible for clients to evaluate properly . <p> There 's another , less obvious force at work : the perceived weakness of the IRS . True , the taxmen made headlines with a June crackdown on charitable " split-dollar insurance , " a smelly scheme in which tax-deductible " donations " were used to buy insurance to benefit the donor 's family . And the IRS is loudly threatening to attack inflated charitable deductions for clunker cars . <p> But the IRS ' attack on split-dollar insurance came months after key congressmen had moved to block the ploy . And the IRSseems to be tolerating donor-friendly manipulations of charitable trusts it once would have frowned on , such as investing in variable annuities to game the timing of income . Moreover , with competition mounting and the audit rate dropping , legal advisers seem willing to sign off on any idea that has n't been explicitly banned , if it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter of the law . We 're talking creative accounting here : donors are even being asked to sign confidentiality agreements before seeing the latest schemes . <p> The donors listen eagerly . They especially love the many new ways to give money away and still control it  --  including " donor-advised " funds , such as Fidelity 's Charitable Gift Fund , and " donor-involved " funds , such as those offered by the National Heritage Foundation . ( The difference : National Heritage encourages you to use fund assets to pay your children for volunteer work ; Fidelity does n't allow it . ) <p> The pitch is that you take your deduction now , but decide in ten years whether Stanford gets the money . If your daughter does n't get in , you send the money to cancer research instead . Such control was once available only to the wealthiest , who could afford private foundations ; now you can do it with $10,000 at Fidelity . <p> Big sellers these days : charitable remainder trusts and , increasingly , once obscure charitable lead trusts . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , too . Or as the client-catching gym shirt worn by St. Louis estate-planner John Olsen puts it : " ' T is better to give and to receive . " <p> Look at the names of some current products and you might not guess that they are linked to charity . FORBES spotted the Capital Gains Bypass Trust , the Enhanced Income Trust and the Deferred Inheritance Trust , among others . To compete , charities themselves are emphasizing financial angles and sponsoring seminars by the likes of J. Dan Recer , author of the book How to Disinherit Your Son-in-Law and Stiff the IRS  --  Keep Your Money in Your Family . <p> The danger here is that investors will be so mesmerized by a potential tax shelter that they ignore simpler , cheaper ways to accomplish both their charitable and financial goals . Example : Simply by giving highly appreciated stock directly to charity while you 're alive , you can cut after-tax giving costs to 40 cents on the dollar or less . Leave an IRAto charity at your death , and the gift can cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complicated trust . <p> " There 's going to be a lot of remorse from those who are just in it for the deal , " sighs Los Angeles lawyer Douglas K. Freeman . One of his clients , a charity , is being threatened with a suit by a " donor " who discovered a better way to avoid capital gains tax after he had put assets in a tax-driven remainder trust . <p> Another trap is that many charitable schemes that look good now wo n't later if either of two events happen : estate and/or capital gains tax rates drop , or stocks endure a prolonged decline . <p> Unfortunately , common sense alone ca n't guide you . Some charitable schemes that sound too good to be true are in fact legal . Attorney Craig Wruck , now with Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank , recalls pitching a then obscure  --  but legal  --  lead trust to an alum when he worked at a university . " The donor called and said , ' My accountant says I 'll go to jail if I do this . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the right response . Some of what 's allowed does n't make sense . " <p> There 's also no safety in sticking with big-name providers . Among those selling the split-dollar insurance now under attack by the IRS were planners from American Express , which has a network of 10,000 advisers . Its imprimatur persuaded Donald Rutledge , a planner in Chapel Hill , N.C. , to put about a dozen clients into the product despite initial misgivings . Now he 's sorry . <p> If you are prosperous , you are going to get pitched , sooner or later . Here 's a rundown of several current schemes . <p> Charitable remainder unitrust . With a CRUT , a donor gives a highly-appreciated , low-income asset to a trust that will last for a term of years , typically either 20 years or someone 's life . During the term , one or more individuals get an annual payout of a fixed percentage of the trust 's value ( say , 8% ) . <p> When the term ends , the charity gets what 's left  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donor uses IRS tables to figure a one-time deduction based on the charity 's projected share . By law , the deduction is for the discounted present value of the remainder interest , and it must be at least 10% of the original contribution . <p> The great advantage here is that the donor can get rid of an asset without taking a 20% capital gains hit . Thus the CRUT 's payout is based on the asset 's entire value . Best CRUT candidates are highly appreciated stock , real estate , even a business . Who 's the trustee ? Increasingly , donors are serving as their own trustees , which can carry legal risks . <p> Insurance salesmen love CRUTs . They can market them with a life insurance trust that " replaces " for heirs the asset that the donor has given away . What these salesmen do n't say is that there are other ways to soften or forestall a capital gains hit : installment sales , exchange funds , Section 1031 exchanges or just leaving the asset in your estate . <p> Look at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by San Rafael , Calif. - based WealthNet , which has done recent marketing deals with 13 insurance companies and a brokerage firm . It depicts a couple , aged 64 and 65 , who set up a $1 million CRUT ( it calls this a " Wealth Accumulation Trust " ) with low-yielding stock that has a cost for tax purposes of $100,000 . It shows they end up with $540,000 more income on a net present-value basis by using the trust . But that assumes that one of them lives a full 30 years , that they pay high California taxes and that they sell and reinvest all their appreciated stock at once . <p> Insurance salesmen often embellish further , comparing results for a CRUT-life insurance trust combo with doing not even the simplest estate planning , such as making $10,000 annual tax-free gifts to children or setting up the same insurance trust to pay estate taxes . " This is a basic planning sin , " says Boston estate planner Scott Fithian . " You take a person in a bad situation and show one positive alternative without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the CRUT collapse , the donor 's annual payout will , too . How is he going to pay bills  --  or life insurance premiums ? <p> Chutzpah trust . That 's the name skeptics have given one push-the-limits CRUT variation . They are right to be sarcastic , since the IRS is almost sure to go after it . Yet big accounting firms are said to be promoting it . <p> A little more background here : CRUT payouts consist of " tiers " of income , with the more highly taxed deemed to emerge first . So if trust income is a mixture of dividend , capital gain and tax-free income ( from muni bonds or principal ) , the ordinary income must be used up before the payout can be taxed as gain , and gain must be used before the payout can be tax-free . <p> In a chutzpah trust , a donor puts highly appreciated stock in a CRUT set up to pay out 25% to 50% of the trust 's balance for two to four years . But the trustee does n't sell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters into a forward sales contract to provide cash for the first few years ' payout . Because the trust has little or no income of its own to make the huge payout , the donor cheekily treats the payout as tax-free return of principal . Result : The donor has laundered gains , avoiding the 20% tax by giving 10% of the stock 's value to charity . And he has gotten an income tax deduction for that 10% . <p> Spigot trust . Here the trust payout is a set percent of its value , say 8% , or the trust 's income , whichever is less . Any shortfall from the 8% is booked in a " make-up " account the donor can draw on later , if the trust has excess income over 8% . <p> The idea is that a middle-aged donor can put an appreciated asset in the trust , avoid capital gains , and invest the full amount for growth in early years . When the donor retires , he invests for income . Thus he gets a payout based on a bigger principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's often tough to generate enough income to collect all the make-ups . So annuity sellers began aggressively pushing a solution last year , based on a narrow new IRS ruling they took as a green light : The trustee invests all of the trust in variable annuities . No money is booked as " income " or paid out until the trustee opens the income " spigot " by cashing in part of the annuity . <p> An arm of Jackson National Life Insurance Co. recently sent out charitable trust marketing binders to 1,500 agents . For a spigot trust , says Kelli Stile , a Jackson vice president , " you ca n't really find a better investment than a variable annuity . " <p> We beg to differ . Remember the " tiers " of income ? If the trust uses variable annuities , every penny paid will be taxed as ordinary income . If a trustee had invested in growth stocks , much of it could qualify as capital gains , taxed at half the rate . <p> To show just how crazy things have gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme . To prevent donors from having income when they do n't want it , lawyers suggest you drop a single member limited liability company into the trust . Supposedly it can trade stocks freely and bank capital gains , distributing them only when the donor wants income . <p> Throughout all this , of course , no one mentions that such strategies may well violate the trustee 's legal duties to the charity as a fiduciary . There is also a real risk that the IRS will decide that donor-dominated management disqualifies a trust . <p> Charitable lead annuity trust . The CLAT is the mirror image of a remainder trust . Here the object is not to shelter past growth from capital gains , but to pass assets  --  particularly appreciating ones  --  to heirs without incurring punishing estate taxes . <p> The donor puts assets in a CLAT that makes annual payments to charity for a term . When it 's up , the heirs get the asset . As with a remainder trust , the IRS takes a snapshot of the deal when it 's created , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  now just 7.2%  --  and taxes the assets being passed to heirs based on that . <p> The name of the game here is to pick assets that will outrun the assumed rate of return , and/or to manipulate CLAT rules so that they show little or nothing going to the heirs , when in fact the heirs will make out well . <p> FLP-enhanced CLAT . The donor puts shares of a family limited partnership into the CLAT and values those shares at less  --  say , 35% less  --  than the underlying assets in the partnership . This discount is justified by all the restrictions built into the partnership ( by the donor , of course ) . <p> The IRS hates FLP discounts but has had little success challenging them ( FORBES , Oct. 19 , 1998 ) . The discount makes the payout to charity , as a percent of the trust 's assets , look bigger than it really is and the gift to the heirs a lot smaller  --  exactly what the donor wants . <p> We talked to experts and our best guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a very effective technique , " says attorney Nill . " But it 's tricky and has to be done absolutely right , since you 're likely to face an audit . " <p> Sickroom CLAT . Mary sets up a trust that pays so much a year to a charity during her life , then disburses the principal to her son Sam . How big is her gift to Sam , for gift-tax purposes ? IRS rules allow calculations based on the average life expectancy for people Mary 's age , as long as Mary has , according to the doctors , a 50% or better chance of surviving two years . If Mary is 57 but smokes and has emphysema , the family is likely to come out ahead giving money away . <p> What if Mary is healthy ? Then she can link the life span of the trust to somebody else  --  maybe Aunt Ethel , or a stranger . San Francisco planner J.J. McNab reports being approached in July by a lawyer offering $5,000 a head for unwell young folks willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the remainder for heirs can be calculated using the average ( long ) life span of a young person . When this unfortunate stranger dies young , heirs get a bundle . <p> There 's nothing in tax law that explicitly forbids this ghoulish scheme . But McNab gagged on it  --  and so might the IRS . She 's afraid that when Congress gets around to cracking down , it will outlaw other , more legitimate tax breaks , too . <p> Jerry J. McCoy , a Washington charitable law expert , has an interesting vantage on all this . As a young lawyer , he was detailed to observe Congress during the last massive charitable tax reforms , in 1969 . Ironically , that law created remainder trusts and lead trusts to replace then-current abuses . He has a simple warning for investors : " Anything promoted as the last great shelter soon will be , because Congress or the IRS will shut it down . " <p> So look at your portfolio carefully before you decide how to make a donation , consider some subtle variations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noncharitable bequests as an ensemble  --  but do n't get greedy . Says McCoy : " I was explaining a lead trust to a client recently , and he said , ' But I do n't come out ahead on this . ' And I said , ' You 're right , you do n't . It 's charitable . ' " <p> <p> DIAGRAM : The Giving Game : Will you win or lose ? <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> You may not have heard of New Life Corp . of America , a Brentwood , Tenn. - based charity also doing business as National Community Foundation , but thousands of insurance agents have . In glossy brochures and seminars , New Life sells itself as " one of the foremost leaders in the estate planning field " and offers commissions  --  typically 6% , but sometimes more  --  if clients sign up for its charitable gift annuities . In these deals you give appreciated assets to New Life in return for an annual payout for life and a partial deduction . <p> New Life 's founder and chairman , Norvell L. Olive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit their Christian missionary charity has no donor base , but they plan to build a fund-raising machine through insurance agents , dubbed " charitable emissaries . " There are 6,000 in their database so far . <p> Ethical question : Should charities be paying finder 's fees to insurance agents who bring in donations ? Most big charities say no . Legal question : Does paying commissions make a charity subject to registration by the Securities &; Exchange Commission ? Most readers of the 1995 federal Philanthropy Protection Act say yes . New Life disagrees , but the SEC has n't bought its argument . New Life also claims the 1995 federal law has overridden a California law requiring issuers of gift annuities there to get state approval . California disagrees , and is investigating New Life . <p> New Life has a colorful past . Olive created it as the World Bible Society of America in 1979 , and first drew attention with a book predicting the rapture of the faithful on the Jewish New Year , 1988 . According to press reports at the time , he spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity . In 1991 Olive sold the publishing assets , changed the name to New Life and invested in apartments and ostrich farming . In 1997 he got out of most of the apartments and stepped up marketing of charitable products . <p> While fending off oversight of itself , New Life has had problems overseeing how its products are sold . Consider the experience of Hazen Foster of Glendale , Ariz . A financial planner got an 8% commission  --  $36,265  --  for persuading him to buy a $453,308 New Life annuity in 1997 . Foster , now 79 , says he does n't think he understood he was giving assets away , but adds his memory is n't great . <p> There 's also the case of Norman Neuerburg , a 71-year-old Los Angeles art historian who bought a $150,000 New Life gift annuity from a " charitable emissary " in 1997 . Soon after , he asked the emissary to set up a remainder trust with seven museums as the charitable beneficiaries . Yet the legal forms Neuerburg got back and signed required the trust funds to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neuerburg suffered a fatal stroke shortly afterwards . In May a court decided to cut New Life and Mid-America out of the $2 million trust . <p> In this case Olive blames Mid-America Financial Group , which drafted Neuerburg 's trust . Mid-America , which was sanctioned in 1996 by the Missouri Supreme Court for unauthorized practice of law , introduced New Life to the gift annuities business . For a time the two firms had a marketing deal . Now they 're suing each other over issues including allegations of mishandled assets and purloined insurance agent lists . <p> Whether or not Mid-America was in error , New Life did encourage agents , in a 1998 brochure , to have clients leave it their trust remainders . The incentive : " You receive front-end fees upon the death of the donor and perpetual trailing fees until you retire from the management of the assets . " <p> Finally , there 's New Life 's involvement in the notorious charitable split-dollar life insurance . In these schemes , donors gave money to a charity and took a deduction , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance policy benefiting not only itself but the donor . <p> Last November , New Life acquired Family First , a for-profit marketer of split-dollar policies and gift annuities , promising its owner up to $9 million in commissions over 5 years . Olive says that New Life took in about $65 million from " donors " to fund split-dollar policies . <p> But after key lawmakers effectively killed split-dollar last February , New Life fired Family First 's founder and stopped paying premiums . The founder is suing for breach of contract . Meanwhile , " donors " want money back and lawyers are circling . Olive is unconcerned : " Everybody sues everybody , " he says . " That 's not anything unusual , especially in a deal like this . " <p> Yes , lawsuits are flying . Last year , the buyer of a $1.2 million house sold by New Life ( and formerly lived in by Olive ) sued , alleging that New Life and Olive hid termite infestation . They deny it . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> Two years ago , nearing 70 , Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $40 million or so in death taxes that would be payable when he and his wife died . Meetings with lawyers did n't reassure him . " Emotionally , it 's difficult and makes you think of death , but the lawyers are scriveners , " says Risman . " They ca n't work out a sophisticated plan that suits all the family 's needs . " <p> The person who could was Kenneth Fink , president of Family Wealth Counselors of Minneapolis . He is one of a new wave of planners who have built lucrative practices helping wealthy entrepreneurs . <p> These planners take clients on retreats or work up " family financial mission statements . " They probe how much parents want to leave kids , how much they want to avoid the 55% estate tax and what they want to leave to charity . <p> Such searching of souls and the tax code is n't cheap : Fink charges between $12,000 and $40,000 , and the client still has to pay legal fees . <p> For assets that a family ca n't keep , planners use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to the IRS  --  or to charity . Says Scott Fithian , whose Boston-based Legacy Cos. has trained hundreds of planners : " The older and richer people are when they start planning , the greater the reality that they ca n't get it all to the kids . . . . When it 's their money , owners think they 're not wealthy enough to be philanthropists . Once they realize this is money Uncle Sam will get , there is a conversion . " <p> It 's aided by the fact that , through a private foundation , the family can direct the gifts . Risman went to his retreat feeling that estate taxes were " grossly unfair " and wanting to benefit his children . He and his wife emerged with a private foundation , a remainder trust and one lead trust with shares in a family limited liability company , plus two more that spring into being on the death of the surviving spouse . <p> If all goes according to plan , Risman says , the family 's medical and Jewish charities will get tens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They 'll get almost as much as if he 'd skipped the planning : " It wo n't deprive them , and they 'll be involved in the charities . They like the idea . " <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> Last year , Warren Linney , 39 , and his wife , Joan , 44 , were sitting on $5 million worth of stock and partnerships from his first cellular business . Cost basis : close to zero . The couple wanted to diversify and raise cash to fund their favorite environmental causes and his third startup , Broadlink Communications , which provides high-speed data connections over unlicensed frequencies . <p> But they did n't want to pay the $1.4 million in federal and state capital gains taxes on an outright sale . So they turned to Santa Rosa , Calif. charitable planner David Harris of Legacy Solutions . <p> " I do n't want to wait until I die to start giving , ' explains Warren . But Bill Gates aside , most 40-somethings are n't yet financially secure enough to give huge chunks of wealth away . The Linneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So here 's what they did : Over the past two years , they put $600,000 of appreciated assets into donor-advised funds , for a $600,000 deduction . They put another $2 million of the same into a charitable remainder trust that pays them 5.7% of the trust 's value each year . That produced a $200,000 deduction , based on the IRS ' calculations that 10% of the $2 million will be left for charity . With the $800,000 of deductions , they offset gains on sales of other assets . <p> The Linneys figure that the $600,000 in donor-advised funds will cover only about four years of what they plan to give . But at that point  --  assuming Broadlink is successful and they do n't need the trust 's payouts  --  they 'll start donating pieces of their right to receive income from the trust . <p> When they do , they 'll get another deduction . This little-known technique was allowed by the IRS in a 1995 private letter ruling . If the value of the assets in the trust has grown , Harris notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd initially just given the $2 million away .
