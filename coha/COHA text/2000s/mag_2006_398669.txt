Section : Health for Life Genetic testing is transforming medicine  --  and the way families think about their health . As science unlocks the intricate secrets of DNA , we face difficult choices and new challenges . <p> The year is 1895 and Pauline Gross , a young seamstress , is scared . Gross knows nothing about the double helix or the human-genome project  --  such medical triumphs are far in the future . But she does know about a nasty disease called cancer , and it 's running through her family . " I 'm healthy now , " she reportedly confides to Dr. Aldred Warthin , a pathologist at the University of Michigan , " but I fully expect to die an early death . " <p> At the time , Gross 's prediction ( she did indeed die young of cancer ) was based solely on observation : family members had succumbed to colon and endometrial cancer ; she would , too . Today , more than 100 years later , Gross 's relatives have a much more clinical option : genetic testing . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own DNA , learning  --  while still perfectly healthy  --  whether they carry a hereditary gene mutation that has dogged their family for decades and puts them at serious risk . Ami McKay , 38 , whose great-grandmother Tilly was Gross 's sister , decided she wanted to know for her children 's sake . In 2002 , the answer came back : positive . " It changes who you are , " says McKay . <p> Genetic testing is changing medicine , too . Three years after scientists announced they had sequenced the human genome , new knowledge about how our genes affect our health is transforming the way diseases are understood , diagnosed , treated  --  and even predicted . Today gene tests are available for more than 1,300 diseases , including cystic fibrosis and hemophilia . And now , as genetic screening gets cheaper and faster , researchers are hunting down the biological underpinnings of more-complex disorders that involve multiple genes  --  big , rampaging illnesses that strike millions of Americans every year . On the list : type 2 diabetes , Alzheimer 's , heart disease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some of these diseases could be available by 2010 . Testing positive does n't guarantee that you 'll get the illness , but it does help determine your risk . " We are on the leading edge of a genuine revolution , " says Dr. Francis Collins , head of the National Human Genome Research Institute . <p> Genetic testing today starts at the earliest stages of life . Couples planning to have children can be screened prior to conception to see if they are carriers of genetic diseases ; prenatal tests are offered during pregnancy , and states now screen newborns for as many as 29 conditions , the majority of them genetic disorders . For Jana and Tom Monaco , of Woodbridge , Va. , early testing has made an enormous difference in the lives of their children . Their journey began in 2001 , when their seemingly healthy third child , 3i-year-old Stephen , developed a life-threatening stomach virus that led to severe brain damage . His diagnosis : a rare but treatable disease called isovaleric acidemia ( IVA ) , marked by the body 's inability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unknowingly , Jana and her husband were carriers of the disease , and at the time , IVA was not included in newborn screening . The Monacos had no warning whatsoever . <p> Not so when Jana got pregnant again . Her daughter , Caroline , was tested by amnio while still in the womb . Knowing Caroline had the mutation , doctors were able to administer medication the day she was born . And the Monacos were prepared to monitor her diet immediately to keep her healthy . Today Stephen , 9 , is unable to walk , talk or feed himself . Caroline , meanwhile , is an active , healthy 4-year-old . Genetic testing , says Jana , " gives Caroline the future that Stephen did n't get to have . " <p> The future is what drives many adults to the clinic . The gene tests currently offered for certain diseases , like breast and colon cancer , affect only a small percentage of total cases . Inherited mutations , including BRCA1 and 2 , contribute to just 5 to 10 percent of all breast cancers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 3 to 5 percent of diagnoses . But the impact on a single life can be huge . The key : being able to do something to ward off disease . " Genetic testing offers us profound insight , " says Dr. Stephen Gruber , of the University of Michigan . " But it has to be balanced with our ability to care for these patients . " <p> Ami McKay now has an annual colonoscopy . Another kind of genetically driven colon cancer , familial polyposis , is treated by removing the colon . The risk of breast and ovarian cancers in people with BRCA mutations can be reduced by frequent screening and radical surgery , too . Having healthy breasts or ovaries removed is n't easy , but the payoff  --  an end to constant anxiety and a pre-emptive strike at disease  --  can be well worth it . " Most women I 've met who 've had prophylactic surgery are glad they made the choice even if they 're unhappy they were put in that position , " says Sue Friedman , a breast-cancer survivor and head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary cancers . " It 's a double-edged sword . " <p> Genetic testing , exciting as it may seem , is n't always the answer . When Wendy Uhlmann , a genetic counselor at the University of Michigan , teaches medical students , she flashes two slides on a screen side by side . One says ignorance is bliss . The other : knowledge is power . That 's because the value of testing becomes especially murky  --  and ethically complicated  --  when there is no way to prevent or treat disease , as in the case of early-onset Alzheimer 's , which often strikes before the age of 50 , or Huntington 's . <p> Today only about 5 percent of people who are at risk for Huntington 's  --  which is caused by a single gene and leads to a progressive loss of physical control and mental acuity  --  take the test . Many are worried that genetic testing will put their health insurance or job security in jeopardy . While there have been few documented cases of discrimination , nobody can say for sure what will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for predictive testing . States have a patchwork of regulations in place , but what needs to happen now , experts say , is for Congress to pass the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act , which would put a federal stamp of approval on keeping genetic information safe . <p> For Shana Martin , 26 , of Madison , Wis. , the decision not to get tested is far more personal . Shana grew up watching her mother , Deborah , battle Huntington 's . Now a fitness instructor ( and the current world champion in logrolling , no less ) , Shana is young , strong , healthy  --  and not interested in opening her genetic Pandora 's box . " I do n't know how well I 'd handle a positive result , and with how happy I am right now , that would just put a real shadow over my life , " she says . " I 'm much more comfortable with it being an unknown . " <p> Some people , however , ca n't live with uncertainty . Uhlmann 's patient Stephanie Vogt knew Huntington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his three brothers all died of complications of the disease  --  and she wanted to find out where she stood . " As soon as I found out there was a test , I just had to do it , " she says . In August 2000 , after comprehensive genetic counseling , Stephanie , her sister , Victoria , and their mother , Gayle Smith , learned her results : positive . " It was like a scene out of ' The Matrix , ' where everything freezes and starts again , " says Stephanie , now 35 and single . Victoria , 36 , who has since tested negative , says she hopes to care for her sister down the road . She also prays for a cure . Knowing is n't always easy . On good days Stephanie feels empowered ; on bad days she 's frightened . " But most of the time , " she says , " I 'm comfortable with the fact that I have the knowledge . " <p> It 's not just their own health that people care about . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , using a scientific advance called preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) , couples can create embryos through standard fertility methods , then screen them for genetic disorders , selecting only those that are mutation-free for implantation . The practice is expensive ( in the tens of thousands of dollars ) and not widespread , but a recent survey of fertility clinics by the Genetics and Public Policy Center found that 28 percent have used PGD to help couples avoid diseases that strike in adulthood , like breast cancer and Huntington 's . Kari and Tim Baker knew they had to give it a try . Kari 's grandfather died of Huntington 's , and her mother was diagnosed in 1999 . Kari , a board member of the Huntington 's Disease Society of America , wanted to spare her kids . Twins Brooklyn and Levi are now vibrant 2 1/2-year-olds who will never have to worry . " There 's great joy and peace in knowing we did everything we could to not pass this on , " says Tim . <p> Testing is just one piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sophisticated therapies that home in on a disease 's biological glitch , then fix the problem . Already , genes are helping to predict a patient 's response to existing medications . A prime example in this field of pharmacogenetics , says Dr. Wylie Burke of the University of Washington , is a variant of a gene called TPMT , which can lead to life-threatening reactions to certain doses of chemotherapy . A genetic test can guide safe and appropriate treatment . Two genes have been identified that influence a person 's response to the anti-blood-clotting drug warfarin . And scientists are uncovering genetic differences in the way people respond to other widely used medications , like antidepressants . <p> Knowing a patient 's genotype , or genetic profile , may also help researchers uncover new preventive therapies for intractable diseases . At Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Dr. Christopher Ross has tested several compounds shown to slow the progression of Huntington 's in mice . Now he wants to test them in people who are positive for the Huntington 's mutation but have not developed symptoms  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always involve sick people seeking cures . " We 're using genetics to move from treating the disease after it happens , " he says , " to preventing the worst symptoms of the disease before it happens . " <p> Early on , the targets of genetic medicine were rare , single-gene disorders , like sickle-cell anemia and Tay-Sachs . Now it 's time for the big guns  --  genetically complex but common conditions like heart disease . A number of genes have already been linked to such illnesses , but many more are at work . The human-genome project , which defines the 99.9 percent of DNA we all have in common , was the starting point . Act II : the " Hap Map "  --  a genetic atlas completed last year that zeroes in on the .1 percent of DNA that differs among individuals . The Hap Map is proving to be a boon to scientists , allowing them to scan whole chunks of DNA , rather than single genes , to isolate mutations responsible for disease . Already , the Hap Map has helped scientists uncover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading cause of vision loss in older people . At Harvard , Dr. Rudolph Tanzi is using the Hap Map to track down gene mutations that cause the common , late-onset form of Alzheimer 's , which could strike as many as 16 million Americans by the year 2050 . Tanzi 's work is funded by the Cure Alzheimer 's Fund , a nonprofit that is investing $3 million to unravel the Alzheimer 's genome , which it hopes to complete by the summer of 2008 . Tanzi says a prototype genetic chip to test for the disease could be available within five years . Dr. Eric Topol , of Case Western Reserve University , is hunting down genes that predispose people to heart attacks . <p> Private companies , interested in developing drug therapies , are investing in DNA as well . In Iceland , deCode Genetics has pinpointed a gene mutation for type 2 diabetes called TCF7L2 . One copy of the mutation increases an individual 's risk by 40 percent , two copies by 140 percent , says CEO Kari Stefansson . Stefansson says he expects a genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a joint effort by NIH and Pfizer , announced earlier this year , is searching for genes for a host of diseases , including schizophrenia , bipolar disease and severe depression . <p> As science advances , business follows . Today genetic testing usually takes place in specialized clinics , where patients undergo thorough counseling both before and after testing so that they  --  and other family members  --  understand the emotional and practical implications that might arise . But do-it-yourself online testing companies , advertised directly to consumers , are springing up on the Internet . Ryan Phelan , CEO of DNA Direct , founded in 2004 , says her site provides a " virtual genetics clinic , " making testing as easy as sending in a cheek swab . ( Cost : anywhere from $200 to $3,300 . ) DNA Direct provides counseling and does not sell remedies after results are in . But other companies are not so scrupulous , marketing tests that have little to no scientific validity , then pushing products as therapy . Critics say they need more oversight . " What you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England Medical Center , " is a real blurring of the lines between medical testing and product marketing . " <p> Scientific revolutions must be tempered by reality . Genes are n't the only factors involved in complex diseases  --  lifestyle and environmental influences , such as diet or smoking , are too . And predictions about new tests and treatments may not come to pass as fast as researchers hope  --  they may not come at all . Still , it 's hard not to get excited about the future , especially when you consider the medical competition now underway : NIH has challenged researchers to come up with a method , within the next 10 years , to sequence a single human genome for $1,000 ( today 's cost : $5 million to $10 million ) . Assuming it works , one day not too far in the future , each of us will go to the doc , hand over our blood and get back our personalized biological blueprints . " It 's an astounding curve to be riding , " says Collins .
