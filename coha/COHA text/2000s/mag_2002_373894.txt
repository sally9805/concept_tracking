It 's hard in Florida in a campaign containing a Bush not to be drawn back to the 2000 election , when presidential candidate George W. Bush needed Governor Jeb Bush to safely deliver the state . He famously could n't , and Bush had to be towed across the finish line by the Supreme Court . Now it 's Jeb who needs rescuing in an unexpectedly tight race for re-election against political neophyte Bill McBride , and Big Brother George is doing everything he can to help him , short of commuting to work there . He has made 11 trips ( a 12th is planned for this week ) , helped raise at least $6 million ( Bush is spending $30 million to McBride 's $10 million ) and directed millions more in federal pork toward Tallahassee . He has deployed a parade of Cabinet Secretaries as well as Dad and Mom , who produced a Kodak moment at last week 's debate when she hugged former Attorney General Janet Reno , the opponent Jeb dearly wished to have . <P> Despite the high-caliber help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former Marine with a Bronze Star and a folksy manner who gave up a student deferment to go to Vietnam . Last year , when he found himself " screaming at the TV set , frustrated " at where the state was headed , McBride quit his post as managing partner of Holland &; Knight , which he had built into the fifth largest law firm in the U.S. ( his wife was once head of Bank of America in Florida ) , and launched his long-shot bid for Governor . McBride dresses like Columbo and campaigns like the late Governor Lawton Chiles , a Democrat who appealed to Republicans by walking the state and calling himself a cracker . <P> McBride has made education the centerpiece of his campaign and vigorously supports a referendum , expected to pass , that would reduce class size . In a tax-phobic state , McBride has proposed a 50-a-pack cigarette tax and unspecified spending cuts to pay for the school initiative . Bush , on the grounds that he does n't support the referendum , offers no clue as to how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to apologize after he confided to concerned Republican lawmakers , unaware a reporter was present , that he had a " couple of devious plans " to thwart the proposal should it pass . <P> Jeb is more like Al Gore than he is like his easygoing brother . The Governor is a policy wonk who has to grind away for his successes . When George , not Jeb , was the first to win a statehouse , Mom exclaimed , " Can you believe it ! ? " Jeb is n't nearly as playful as his palm tree  --  covered tie would suggest . At a retirement center in Boynton Beach , he solemnly shakes hands , quietly adding an " honestly " to his " I need your vote . " He tells TIME the race is close " but not as close as Mr. McBride 's internal polls suggest . That 's a fund-raising tool . " At a school in New Smyrna Beach with the President , there are none of the usual little-brother jokes that Jeb never found funny anyway . The two then move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion .
