THEY CREPT THROUGH A forest on fire . <p> Caroline , her hands sweaty from one of the many hot flashes that had added to her panic since they 'd started out on their drive , was behind the wheel . Her husband , Sandy , sat in the passenger 's seat , restless . <p> " Why are you being so nutso about this ? " he asked . " It 's okay . Really . I believe you . They were there . You saw them . " <p> " No , you do n't , " she said . " I can tell . " <p> Her eyes anxiously scanned the sides of the road , hoping to see the deer . <p> Around them the trees blazed with the most intense autumn foliage the two had ever seen , as if the woods really were going up in flames . Their leaves lit from behind by October light , the sugar maples , scarlet oaks , dogwoods , and hop hornbeams colored the woods more vibrantly than anything she could create on the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . Every so often , a breeze crossed the narrow rural highway , sending leaves whirling down and across the road , a shower of twisting , twirling sparks in red , yellow , orange , and purple , like tiny comets falling from a lesser sky . <p> Though the illusion of a mountain ablaze was only that , Caroline felt yet another wave of heat wash uncomfortably through her body . What was this ? Her twelfth one ? <p> I 'm too young for hot flashes , she thought . I 'm not even forty . <p> Caroline would swear they 'd navigated every road in this rural Virginia county in the past four hours , all to no avail . She 'd driven at a speed that had the locals climbing up on her tail , forcing her to pull over to the side of the road again and again , letting entire trains of cars go by , all in the hopes of spotting an unusual and elusive herd of ' deer she remembered from close to twenty years before . <p> " Why now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to find them again after all these years ? " <p> " I do n't know , " she admitted . " I just want to . " <p> " Need to , is more like it . " <p> " Is that okay ? " ' <p> Sandy had always been an indulgent husband , right up to the time things started to go wrong for them . Obliging , but always with a lot of mock exasperation , heavy sighs , half-hidden rolling of his eyes , his mild features infused with a no-nonsense retro manliness that would have been more appropriate in the days of black and white movies . <p> " Sure , " he said . " Let 's go for it . " <p> They started out in Staunton , leaving behind the Shenandoah Valley , its terrifying interstate and relentlessly verdant cow pastures , climbing higher and higher into the Appalachians , past the rotting remnants of mills built two centuries before , 1950s brick ranchers , and vaguely white farmhouses that appeared picturesque only until you were nearly on top of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely looked junky . <p> Bypassing Buffalo Gap , circumventing Elliot Knob , and choosing to ignore West Augusta , they drove through Deerfield by 8:30 A.M. , having chosen it as a tentative goal for the name alone . Caroline spotted no deer , not even the common white-tailed variety that so often lay in broken heaps by the sides of the highway , victims of head-on collisions with pickup trucks . An hour later they left the Appalachians behind for the Alleghenies near the West Virginia border . <p> If only she could remember where exactly she 'd seen the deer cross the road so long ago . <p> " What about Grant ? " Sandy asked . " Is n't he going to be worried ? " <p> Grant , her fiance , was back in their hotel room , still asleep , she hoped , blissfully unaware that she 'd gotten up before it was light to take this forbidden drive with her old husband . Sandy was n't supposed to be in her life anymore . <p> " I wanted to tell him , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " <p> " Coward , " Sandy said . " Did you at least leave a note ? " <p> " What are you afraid of , that he 's going to call you out into an alley and ask you to settle things the old-fashioned way ? " <p> " Not hardly . " <p> A chipmunk darted into the road , then retreated with lightning speed even before Caroline could react and brake . She decided it was best to change the subject . " Did I tell you that the old fruit packing plant off Broadway back home burned down two weeks ago ? " <p> " The brick Victorian one ? With the giant apple crate label painted on the side ? " <p> Caroline nodded . <p> " God , I loved that old place . Loved hanging out there .... " <p> " With you , " she finished for him , turning her face to meet his gaze , smiling a tight smile . " Me , too . " <p> His return smile was a sad one , which fit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same northern California town , at the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas , former Gold Rush territory . <p> " Was it arson ? " he asked finally . <p> " I do n't know . But something strange happened while it was on fire . I saw something bizarre . " <p> " Bizarre how ? " <p> " Very weird . They called in a water bomber to help put out the fire . I guess the fire was getting too big for a couple of small-town fire trucks to handle from the ground . A bunch of us were standing on that hill that overlooks where Main and Broadway come together , right above the fruit plant . J ) o you remember how the roof was just below the top of that ridge ? " <p> " Yeah . Well , sort of . No , not really . " <p> " It was , " she said , " and so were the flames . They were almost cartoony , like Mexican folk art , like a milagro , with flames sprouting from a sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to continue . " Okay . " <p> " Suddenly , the tanker plane swoops in to drop its load . It was so low it flew right past us , the cockpit window on the same level as all of us standing on the hill . We could see right in . I could see the pilot 's face even though he was eight stories off the ground . " <p> She hesitated , not knowing how to finish her story . <p> " What is it , Caroline ? What happened ? " <p> Their current choice of road came to an abrupt end when it intersected another one perpendicular to it . A honeysuckle-ensnared sign on the other side of the three-way intersection gave them a choice . Turn left toward a place called Cherry Lick . Turn right toward Monterrey . <p> She recognized neither and turned left . <p> " What happened ? " he repeated . <p> " I remembered something . " <p> How did she explain it to him , to anyone ? It made no sense . Watching the tanker fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flashback of different , long suppressed memory . <p> When she was not even five years old , she and her parents had lived in the desert , hours north of Los Angeles in a lonely subdivision with only six houses . Her father was stationed at Edwards Air Force Base . Jets scorched the sky overhead most days while she played in the backyard , their contrails crisscrossing above the vast expanse of undeveloped land and parched hills that lay beyond the houses . <p> One afternoon , however , brought a completely different sight . As she stood digging up the brown grass below their clothesline with a stick , an odd craft zipped low to the ground through the side yards separating her house from the one next door . It had no wings and resembled a missile , except that it was large enough to carry a person inside . She could see the occupant 's face while the slender silver object streaked by inches from the top of her fence . <p> As a thirty-eight-year-old woman , Caroline was stunned to recover this memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , she realized she had no clue what she 'd actually witnessed as a child , if she 'd witnessed anything at all , perhaps distorted a common sight , or dreamed it up from a five-year-old 's working knowledge of the world . What shocked her most was that until only two weeks ago , this recollection had been cataloged as a real thing . All her life , even if in her mind 's dimmest recesses , she had believed in it . Her once naive eyes had seen what they 'd seen , accepting it without question , and stored the visual away as if it were just another mundane childhood memory . <p> " Huh , " was all Sandy said when she finally stumbled through the complete rendition . He appeared thoughtful , yet confused . She could identify . She felt bewildered . <p> " It bothers me , " she said , " that this whole time I never questioned the reality of it . It was never true . " <p> By now she realized the hot flashes were a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Her heart skipped unevenly in her chest and her throat constricted . She struggled to breathe . <p> Narrowing more the farther they went , the country highway squeezed down until there was no room for a double line in the middle of the road , constricted to the point where any form of center line had to be completely abandoned . Instead of slowing , she sped up . By now Grant would be awake . He would wonder where she 'd gone . How long before he began to worry ? She should call him . <p> Digging into her handbag , which lay beside her seat , she fished for her cell , opened it one-handed and activated it , waiting for a signal . No response . Was it any wonder ? <p> " Damn . I ca n't get a signal . " <p> " We should turn back . " <p> " No ! " she shouted , then in a more reasonable tone . " No . Just a little bit longer . There 's got to be a gas station with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service station , yes , but no phone . Seven miles after the rural route became a single paved lane , and two miles beyond that , when the asphalt itself crumbled away leaving only the suggestion of pavement , they finally reached Cherry Lick . <p> Outside the rundown Quonset hut that was the community 's only visible building , Caroline spotted five pickups and a Geo Metro with so many replaced door and fender panels of varying colors that it resembled a patchwork quilt . She had no idea where the people who owned the vehicles lived because neither she nor Sandy had seen a house or mobile home for the last forty-five minutes . <p> Cherry Lick had one working gas pump , and one vintage , glass-walled phone booth , minus the phone . A series of crudely painted signs tacked onto the front of the windowless hut advertised ice cold drinks , official NASCAR memorabilia , and a game checking station . <p> " You want something ? " she asked Sandy once she parked . <p> " I 'm good . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm fine . " <p> " I 'll get you a water , " she said , got out with her purse , and shut the car door . <p> Inside , Caroline found an old man with a hunter 's cap and a belly encased in a faded olive drab T-shirt with rips in the underarms . He stood behind a low counter , arms crossed , chewing something . Caroline met his eyes , but he did n't acknowledge her . <p> She snatched two Poland Spring waters in sports bottles out of the cold case and set them on the counter . Lazily , he uncrossed his arms and reached for the bottles , searching them up and down for the tiny price stickers that were plainly visible on the caps . : <p> " Is this Cherry Lick ? " she asked the obvious . - ; . <p> " Has been for a while now , " he said . ; , <p> " Have you lived here long ? " <p> Off in a corner , she heard laughter , and turned to see half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking coffee and smoking at a group of mismatched dinette tables . All stared at her . <p> " Have I lived here long ? " he asked his buddies at the tables . <p> More chuckling . <p> " I 'm asking because I 'm wondering if you were here twenty years ago , " Caroline said . <p> " I was here . We all were . " : <p> " Did you ever see a herd of black deer around here ? " <p> " Black deer ! " He swung around to face his friends , his body language shutting her out . " Any you see any black deer around here ever ? " <p> " Why you want nigger deer for , lady ? " said one of the men . <p> " There ai n't no black deer around here , " said another . <p> The man who 'd made the racial slur took a deep drag on his cigarette , then , resting his elbows on the table , clasped his fingers together into a single fist , cigarette poking upward like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wonder if they 'd taste any different , though , you know . Darkie deer . " <p> The man at the counter faced her again . " Nope . No black deer here . " <p> Back in the car , Caroline dropped the waters into the twin cup-holders attached to the dash . She turned the ignition , reached for her water , popped off the cap , and took a long swallow . Her hand was shaking . <p> " Were they any help in there ? " Sandy asked , climbing back into the car . He 'd gotten out to stretch his legs . <p> " No . None . " <p> They took off , following directions from a sign that promised a main highway was just eight miles away . <p> It was 1:12 according to the clock in the dash . With her not having left a word of explanation , Grant must be getting frantic by now . She could n't let this go on much longer . She had to get to a phone , but was terrified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried them up a mountainside so steep and slippery with loose rock she was afraid to stop for fear their car would begin sliding backward and go off the road . Her panic escalated into full-blown dread , which centered itself in her forehead like an inescapable migraine . She almost could n't sit still behind the wheel . <p> Sandy was n't blind , and somewhere , still cared for her . " How about as soon as we get off this road we go get some lunch ? " he urged her . " You do n't need to find them today . We can find a phone and you can call . You 'll feel much better if you can talk to him . " <p> " Thank you , " she said . <p> " For what ? " <p> " For being so adult about Grant . " <p> He joked . " Easy . I 'm here . He 's there . " <p> She 'd never driven through darker woods . The mountains folded in on the road with a smothering embrace . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one else had seen , this should be it . Her gaze flicked anxiously from one side of the road to the other , up one treacherous , shrouded slope , down another . Here . It had to be here . <p> Lurching forward and down , with a grinding scrape coming from the undercarriage , they unexpectedly crested the mountain and dropped out onto a three-lane highway . Two gas stations , a post office , and a restaurant-motel greeted the couple from the other side . <p> A horn blared to their right . Caroline hit the brakes and swerved , barely avoiding a black SUV . They were back in semi-civilization . <p> Defeat instantly overwhelmed her , stunning her to the point where she barely heard the siren . Her mind scrambled for direction and gradually , she brought the car to a stop on the road 's shoulder . Glancing in the rearview mirror , she spotted a uniformed officer approaching the driver 's side window . <p> " License and registration , ma'am . " <p> She handed the man her license . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sandy pointed at the plastic envelope with the car 's papers clipped to her visor . " Oh , " she mumbled . " Here it is . " <p> The cop took her LD. and the registration back to his patrol car and used his radio . <p> " I remember that day so clearly , " she told Sandy . " The dogwoods blooming all over the place , the acid green spring leaves . Where we ate . What we ate . That stupid turtle we stopped and rescued from the middle of the road . And the herd of pure black deer that went leaping across the road as we made a turn . They were gorgeous . Strange . Glossy . Practically mythic . " <p> She and Sandy had been in perfect , untarnished love . Married just under three months , a decade before the rushed trip to the hospital which ultimately tore them apart . <p> An uncomfortable silence drifted into the car . <p> Finally Caroline dispelled it . " I looked it up on the Internet in our hotel room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flipped open his book and started to write her a ticket . <p> " Looked up what ? " Sandy asked . <p> " There are no black deer herds , " Caroline told him . " No such thing . " <p> She could see it dawning on his face , why she wanted the deer so badly , worried they had never existed . " No black deer ? Not anywhere in North America ? " <p> " Maybe one darker-colored deer in millions . Not even really black , dark gray . " <p> " Maybe the ones you saw had gotten dirty . " <p> Shook her head again . <p> " Maybe there was some sort of rare genetic defect . " <p> " No , Sandy ! You did n't see them . " <p> He was quiet . <p> " And neither did I. They never existed . " <p> " What did you say ? " the officer stopped writing in his book and asked . <p> " Nothing , " Caroline 's voice was a faint whisper . " Sorry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peered suspiciously into the vacant back seat , and then back at her in the front . He took in the second bottle of water still capped and full , the empty passenger 's seat beside Caroline . <p> " I thought I heard you say something . " <p> " I did n't . I mean I did , but it was nothing . " <p> " Oh , Caroline , " Sandy said , his eyes bright with concern and something almost like joy . " Honey . " The backs of his fingers reached up to her cheek to catch the tears that threatened while the cop stood watching her . She felt Sandy 's touch , a whisper of affection that surely did n't exist . " The past is still there . I promise . Right where it 's always been . " <p> Author Affiliation
