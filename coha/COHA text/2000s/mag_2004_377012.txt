Alice Harris of South Central Los Angeles fondly remembers the day when the good people from ABC volunteered to demolish her house . In 2003 a flood left the community activist and her family , who had no insurance , living in one bedroom . Worst of all , the waters ruined a stash of Christmas toys Harris had collected for poor kids . " I figured no one was going to come to Watts and help us , " she says . " No one had ever done that . " <P> That was before Extreme Makeover : Home Edition found her . Home Edition brought in its army of designers , led by bullhorn-wielding host Ty Pennington , to do what it does best : destroy a home in order to save it . After shipping Harris and kin off for a week 's vacation in Carlsbad , Calif. , 100 workers and neighbors tore her home down to the foundation and built a new , bigger one . They replaced the Christmas toys and donated appliances , mattresses and landscaping to her flood-stricken neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . <P> Home Edition ( Sundays , 8 p.m . E.T. ) is a TV oxymoron : a feel-good reality show . Without any participant 's having to eat animal entrails or be insulted by judges , it has exploded in its second season into a Top 10 hit by presenting itself less as a home-improvement show than a life-improvement show . Each week the design team meets a family with a heart-wrenching story  --  disability , death , debt  --  and tailors a monster renovation to its needs . For the Vardon family of Oak Park , Mich.  --  two deaf parents with a blind , autistic son named Lance , 12 , and a sighted son Stefan , 14  --  the team built a house with high-tech aids , including flashing-light smoke alarms and Braille labels on the walls . The Vardons also got a $50,000 college scholarship for Stefan . <P> In essence , Home Edition is like the reality-TV version of It 's a Wonderful Life , in which Bedford Falls pitches in to rescue solid citizen George Bailey . Executive producer Tom Forman says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extent we can judge it , merit . We look for people who have been nominated by their neighbors , people whose communities have told us are really special . " The show also hews to the old formula of something for Mom , Dad and the kids : five-hankie stories , plus home-improvement tips , plus guys ripping off roofs with tractors . The renovations run to several hundred thousand dollars , the costs defrayed by conspicuous product placements .
