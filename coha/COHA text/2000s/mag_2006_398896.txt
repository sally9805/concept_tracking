<p> We are a sleep-deprived nation. , and it puts nearly all of us at risk  --  in the gym , in the sack , on the job . <p> The really good news : The cure takes just 8 hours . <p> It 's about what 's happening to us between the hours of 10:15 p.m. and 7 a.m. , when we should be hanging z 's like Twins fans hang KKKKs with Johan Santana on the mound . <p> It 's about me , in bed ( and leave my wife out of it , you perv ) . <p> Not a lot going on between those sheets , you say ? I say , Wake up ! Sleep heals . Sleep calms . Sleep rebuilds . Sleep provides an opportunity for the penile exercise you do n't make time for during your busy day . Sleep shuts down your body and awakens your mind . In addition to being vital , it 's also bizarre and contradictory  --  it 's the inactive activity , the void you fill by dreaming up entire worlds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The science of sleep is only about 40 years old , and among the things yet to be discovered by researchers is. um . how sleep works , exactly . That , and how to define it . But that 's sleep for you : full of mysteries and surprises . <p> Maybe the most surprising thing of all is that 60 million Americans do it very poorly , suffering any number of sleep disorders . And more than half of the afflicted are men , according to James Rowley , M.D. , director of the sleep-disorders center at Harper University Hospital , in Detroit . Many of these guys would deny they have a problem , and those who acknowledge it probably are n't being helped . " Women get motivated when they 're sleepless , " says Dr. Rowley . " Men are silent . " <p> As the years pass , the odds are that these bleary-eyed , silent guys will get even less sleep , and touch off a cascade of other miserable conditions . If sleeplessness does n't put a sudden end to your morning commute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . It can sour the report your doctor gives you on your cardiac risk , make you fatter , and set you up for diabetes . It will make you fight more with your wife , kids , and house pets . Sleeplessness is the symptom that makes its underlying cause  --  stress , depression , pain , or all of the above  --  even worse . <p> For 15 years , I 've been searching for a decent night 's sleep , and I 've had a major health nightmare along the way . Even though I was a committed exerciser with good cholesterol counts , I built a major arterial blockage a few years back . And it came after a 2-year bout of wretched insomnia . <p> Now , when I lay me down to sleep , I know the stakes are high . True for me , true for you , too , brother . For our own good , we all need to rest a little easier . <p> NOWHERE IS THAT MORE EVIDENT than in Las Vegas , where the wee hours take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in the casinos , and William Thompson , Ph.D. , a gambling expert at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas , was my coach . When I asked him how he 'd chosen that academic specialty , he said , " When you 're in Siberia , study polar bears . " <p> And as we walk through the MGM Grand casino , they 're snarling everywhere . He shows me 20 ways Las Vegas casinos push their advantage  --  from having people convert their hard-earned cash into worthless plastic chips before they bet to making it hard to find the exit door . <p> Then , as the clock ticks , the casinos make their shrewdest bet of all : that sleep deprivation will make their customers stupid . <p> To understand why , let 's take a stroll through a sleepy human brain . Our tour guide here is William Killgore , Ph.D. , a major in the Medical Service Corps of the U.S. Army , based at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research . He works in the fascinating area of sleep , cognition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ape to man , our brains developed , too  --  particularly a structure known as the prefrontal cortex , which took information from our senses , mingled it with our memories , and added shadings of emotion and understanding . As man seized dominion over all the earth , our prefrontal cortexes  --  the font of our humanity , of reason  --  led the way . <p> No wonder the casinos are against it . <p> The house 's advantage is to reduce you to a more primitive beast . Glucose metabolism  --  the rate of energy burn in your prefrontal cortex  --  slows down as night turns to day . Uh-oh . A Neanderthal buzz , originating in knuckle-dragging parts of the brain , supplants your higher faculties . Evolution slips into reverse ; you become less human . <p> So much the worse if the beast is up past his bedtime , goes to a strip show , orders a cocktail or two , and smokes a cigar . As Killgore puts it , " Your prefrontal cortex needs a break , so it shuts down . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make effective decisions . " <p> When this happens in the wee hours , Las Vegas is ready : You 're lost in an artificial world . Table stakes rise as the evening goes on . The $5 minimums of the afternoon rise to $20 , then $50 , and suddenly each hand has financial consequences ; if you play long enough , the odds will get you . And these are the guys you 'll see along the Strip the next morning , still wearing last night 's clothes , their prefrontal cortexes aroused by coffee and stress hormones , wondering what hit them last night . <p> Here 's what : They gambled and lost on a mechanism they may only be dimly aware of  --  the circadian rhythms that run their days , their whole lives . When that system orders you into bed , you 'd better listen : It 's just trying to keep you out of trouble . ZZZ <p> I DO N'T MEAN TO PICK ON VEGAS . Men who go there are fully aware of the risks and undertake them anyway  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least the strippers pretend to be friendly . But the casino industry is an example of foolish wagers being placed and lost all across our society . Most men consider sleep a waste of time , and bet their lives they can get along without it . <p> " Who needs sleep ? " asks the Coors beer commercial . " I only get 4 hours a night , " brags your coworker , echoing Thomas Edison , antisleep agitator and inventor of the lightbulb  --  a contributing factor in our drowsy lives . And the rest of us use the language of shame when we " sneak off for a nap " or point out that a coworker was " asleep at the wheel . " And our sleep suffers for it . According to a survey by the National Sleep Foundation , each of us averages 2 hours and 12 minutes less sleep nightly than our great-grandparents did in 1910 . And it is n't just because of high- quality late-night TV . THE 2003 AMERICAN TIME USE <p> Survey shows that we 're trading sleep for all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boss ! " followed , 10 hours later , by " Should we order Chinese ? " ) , but also entertainment ( " Dancing with the Stars is on ! " ) and commuting ( " I ca n't wait to get back on 1-70 to Kansas City tomorrow ! " ) . <p> Think about that last one for a minute . By exchanging rack time for road time , we 're almost guaranteeing that we 'll add to the one-third of all car accidents attributable to drowsy driving . Worse yet , after 5 nights of partial sleep deprivation  --  does that sound like your workweek ?  --  three drinks at happy hour will have the same effect that six would have had if you 'd been well rested . And then you drive home . You might even make it . <p> That 's why , at the end of most of his interviews ( including one with me ) , William Dement , M.D. , Ph.D .  --  a combination Christopher Columbus/Cassandra of sleep research  --  practically shouts his admonition : Drowsiness is a warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Stanford University , has the personal scare story to prove it . Once he was met by a chauffeur at the airport , to give him a ride to a big meeting of sleep docs . The guy was overweight , and he had grown a beard to conceal a smallish chin . You 've probably seen guys like that , too . Well , do n't get into their cars for a nighttime drive . <p> Dr. Dement 's chauffeur was exhibiting the classic physical symptoms of sleep apnea , a disorder that closes an afflicted man 's airway up to 300 times a night and causes monumental health problems in the process . Dr. Dement instantly saw the danger and aggressively conversed with him . Then they pulled onto a road high above the Columbia River gorge , the driver slumped , the car veered across the oncoming traffic lane , and . the good doctor shouted , the driver jerked the wheel , and obituary writers were deprived of a deliciously ironic lead . <p> And Dr. Dement is still alive to deliver the warnings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , every time I called a sleep expert for this story , they refused to answer my questions until they were finished venting over the commercial airline wreck of Comair Flight 5191 out of Lexington , Kentucky , in which both the pilots and the man in the control tower were sleep deprived . Consider the lonely vigil that air-traffic controller will conduct every night from now on as he lays head on pillow . <p> Each of us has plenty in common with that poor soul . If we trade sleep for work , sleep for commuting time , sleep for computer time , we multiply the risk that we 'll make a mistake that kills . If we 're very lucky , we 'll take out only ourselves . <p> Am I belaboring the obvious ? Sleepy driving , after all , is rather like drunken sex or Washington lobbying  --  nobody expects anything good to come of it . But it 's only the most common way that poor sleep can mess up your whole waking life . <p> IT MAY HELP , HERE , TO TAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what you 're missing when you have a lousy one . <p> All day long , you 're burning glucose , the fuel that drives everything you do . One by-product of that inferno is a neurotransmitter called adenosine , which binds with receptors in your nervous system , telling it to shut down for the night . ( That 's why exercisers sleep better : They burn more glucose . ) Reinforcing the effect of adenosine is another energy regulator : melatonin . It also kicks in toward bedtime , so you yawn , hit the power button on the remote , and head into your bedtime rituals . Do them right and you reach the bed ready for sleep . ( Sex works , too : The chaser for intercourse is the hormone oxytocin  --  a profound sleep inducer . It 's the enemy of pillow talk and cuddling , where men are concerned . ) <p> The bridge into unconsciousness is described in stages , which reflect the pattern of electrical impulses recorded in the sleeping mind . Alpha waves hum in the calm , sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electroencephalograph recorder , you begin shutting down your senses . This is stage one , light sleep . If your wife asks you to take out the garbage , you 'll still hop to it . <p> Five minutes later , though , and she 's out of luck . Your senses lock down , and you realize full wet-noodle status . Stage two comes quickly , and the electrical activity is vastly different on the printout . You 're falling fast now , into the deep sleep of stages 3 and 4 . The latter is when your body secretes growth hormone , to reward you for any muscle-building activity you might have engaged in during the day . <p> Next comes rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep , which Dr. Dement famously studied by inviting a chorus line of Rockettes into his New York apartment sleep lab . ( There 's a line you have n't tried : " I 'm a sleep researcher , and I wonder if I might observe you . " ) Your muscles are now utterly paralyzed , your mind utterly alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't run ? That 's REM sleep . <p> If you forget to set the alarm , there 's no need to worry , because as you run through your supply of sleep-inducing melatonin , it 's replaced in your bloodstream by a surge of cortisol . It urges you to get the hell out of bed . <p> So you sit up in a stark panic over the 8 a.m. staff meeting and spot the rising sun out your bedroom window , and your pineal gland shuts down melatonin production entirely . Like Dracula , the gland shies from the sunlight , waiting for dark to turn on the melatonin supply once more and bed you down . <p> OKAY , THAT 'S THE SLEEPING Beauty version of the overnight story . One phase flows neatly into the next , uninterrupted , and the therapeutic process sweeps inevitably toward morning light . Then there 's the way I sleep , which is kind of like the way Reggie Bush runs : all over the place . I found this out at the University of Pennsylvania sleep lab , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campus in Philadelphia . That 's where I went through the ordeal of polysomnography ; in its way , it too was a testament to the power of the sleep drive . I checked into the lab around 8:30 p.m. one night last summer and was met by a sweet , slight sleep technician named Amber . <p> She wired me like an NSA stakeout  --  three brain scanners on my scalp , a breath clip under my nose , straps to monitor chest and torso movements , a movement sensor on my leg to see if I do the midnight jig , and a finger pincer to track my oxygen levels . Thus encumbered by electronics , with a video cam further invading my privacy , I closed my eyes . <p> Amber woke me up at 6:30 a.m. , right after an active half hour of REM sleep . The tapes show what a jumpy thing I am at night . Amber told me that my periodic limb movements might have an arousing effect , but not the kind I forward to . If this is rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nor was Amber complimentary about my other sleep patterns . She noted my hypopneas  --  brief cessations of breath  --  which are n't a problem in a " relatively young man like me " but might become a problem later in life . This sounded like Dr. Dement 's drowsy driver . But I 'm nothing like that guy . <p> And yet , there was Amber telling me that I need to watch out , too . It could be that my throat muscles are relaxing just enough in sleep to affect my airway . The glass of wine I like to have with dinner could encourage that . Plus , I 've been told I have a relatively small jaw and luxuriant tongue tissue ( hey , some people consider that an advantage ) , so maybe I 'm not so far off from apnea land . <p> I left the lab dazed , not only from my rough night under analysis , but also from the news that there 's a lot more going on in the night than I ever realized . Later on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn sleep center , and he was n't too concerned by any of it , opining that maybe I just think about my sleep too much . He was n't the first to suggest that . Many of the researchers I interviewed noted the tendency of chronic insomnia sufferers to ruminate on their sleeplessness . Which I understood completely : The hungry obsess over food , the sleepless focus on their eyelids  --  open or shut . <p> In Salt Lake City , where I attended the convention of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies , I picked up a useful perspective on my obsession . I 'll admit that , at times , the lectures inspired delightful naps on the lawn outside the Salt Palace . But the researchers issued their share of wake-up calls , too . <p> One presentation , for instance , quoted the Austrian neurologist and psychologist Viktor Frankl . During World War II , he was deported to Auschwitz and eventually spent time in four concentration camps . He knew a few things about nightmares . Frankl 's observation : " Sleep is like a dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as one does not pay any attention to it ; if one attempts to grasp it , it quickly flies away . " <p> For the past 15 years , I 've done everything I can to nail that sucker to my bedpost . I 've drugged him . I 've dusted him with stinky herbs . I 've invited him to share a glass of wine with me . And lately I 've enlisted an army of sleep docs to grant me the peace just to let him land . <p> But once that bird starts to fidget , it 's damned hard to make him sit still . <p> I can trace my own difficulties to one blissfully sleepless night in 1990 , at Michael Reese Hospital , in Chicago . That 's when my son Jake was born . One estimate holds that a new baby results in 400 to 750 hours of lost sleep for his parents in the first year ; between Jake and his brother Tyler , I 'm officially down at least a thousand hours . More , if you pack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a mortgage , plus worrying about the Cubs . You can see I 've had way too much on my mind to sleep . <p> But the conference in Salt Lake City reinforced how critical it is to lure Frankl 's bird to my bedside . Name almost any chronic threat to a man 's health , and sleeplessness plays a role . Sometimes a very big one . <p> One hot area of research is the connection between sleep and weight gain , and I 'm not just talking about the infamous Ambien abusers who hoover their fridges . Researchers at the University of Chicago have been tracking the correlation between sleep and two hunger hormones : ghrelin , which urges your body to chow down , and leptin , which tells it to push back from the table . They recruited 12 young men and limited them to 4 hours of sleep on 2 consecutive nights . It was as if they 'd cut their hunger brake lines and attached a brick to their eating accelerators : ghrelin was up 28 percent , leptin down 18 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve University , in Cleveland , gave a fascinating presentation at the conference in which he demonstrated that people who get only 5 hours of sleep a night weigh more than longer sleepers at every age . Think of all the ghrelin surging through their veins , and the extra hours they have to eat crullers . <p> And in fact , the young men in the University of Chicago study who had the greatest ghrelin and leptin swings were the ones who , in surveys , most craved cake , candy , cookies , ice cream , pastry , chips , salted nuts , bread , pasta , cereal , and potatoes . If you salivated when you read that list , take a look at how much sleep you got last night . <p> Another group of researchers at the University of Chicago demonstrated that just 3 nights of fragmented sleep  --  the tossing-and-turning variety  --  made glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity plummet . Both of those , long-term , will elevate blood sugar , which can damage the tiny capillaries that carry oxygenated blood to your heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't worry you , go ahead : Stay up late thumbing the remote . And keep doing it . There will be plenty of time to consider the consequences on the job tomorrow . <p> Killgore 's most recent endeavor has been to round up young , male military recruits , torment them to wakefulness in various ways , and then administer tests that probe for many of the things that get you through the workday : making smart choices , learning new skills , working with people , pushing past failure , laughing off Dilbert moments . Sleep deprivation sabotages them all . Your greatest fear on the job , then , might be that your boss-or worse yet , a rival  --  is getting enough sleep . Against that advantage , your sleepy ass does n't stand a chance . <p> A LOT OF SLEEP RESEARCH SEEMS to begin with being mean to rats . In Salt Lake City , I met many pleasant , intelligent young people who had devised ingenious ways to stress out rodents  --  forcing them to swim against their will , or shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shut-eye . <p> My rat empathy was particularly engaged by tests involving what the researchers called " social defeats . " For instance , there 's the experiment in which a young , naive rat was dropped into a cage along with an attractive female rat . After the two had sniffed and nuzzled a bit , the scientists introduced an older , aggressive male rat into the cage . This rat bastard made life hell for the younger male rat , until the young guy exposed his belly in utter defeat . He slept lousy at night , poor rodent . <p> Oddly enough , that perfectly describes my life in a job I once had . I reacted like the caged rat : by showing my belly and losing sleep . Like , 2 years ' worth . I feared that the circles under my eyes might knit into a noose around my neck . A shrink prescribed an antidepressant/sleep inducer called Trazodone , and it got me through the dark nights . <p> Fortunately , the rat boss was chased off by corporate , and my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my exercise , and I ran marathons in Vermont and New York City . I was quite the physical specimen , in fact , except for the plaque that had been building in the left anterior descending artery of my heart  --  a passageway aptly nicknamed " the widowmaker . " I had no clue about it until I hopped on my bicycle in Martha 's Vineyard , intent on a 50-miler . Chest pain stopped me , nearly for good . <p> I never had a heart attack-just a really good scare . And the angioplasty and stent now seem to have fixed me up just fine . I feel better than ever , and my heart indices are superlative . <p> But nothing can relieve the aching question I have about why I , of all people , developed the blockage in the first place . No doctor in the world would point to my 2 years of sleepless hell as an absolute cause ; it might have been genetics , or plain bad luck . But from what I now know , I wonder if insomnia almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lion of the field , Dr. Dement , quite nearly wrote my epitaph when he pointed out , in the introduction to his compelling bedtime saga , The Promise of Sleep , that " if someone you know has had a heart attack , there is a good chance ( especially if the victim is young ) that an undiagnosed sleep disorder contributed to the problem . " <p> HOW DOES SLEEP AFFECT YOUR heart health ? Let me count the ways . <p> Janet Mullington , Ph.D. , who hangs her mortarboard at Harvard medical school , contributed to a study that linked sleep loss with inflammation-the hot young thing cardiac researchers have been chasing around for the past decade . Essentially , if your blood carries elevated inflammation markers , your heart is in danger . " We 've seen a connection between total sleep deprivation and an increase in white blood cells , interleukin-6 , and C-reactive protein , " she told me , naming a few horsemen of the inflammatory pens with partial sleep deprivation . " <p> Her study also showed increases in blood pressure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the factors that can cause arterial plaques to rupture , and the next step is the blood clots that race to a narrowing in a heart artery , and kill . <p> But not me . Or at least , that 's my plan . <p> I 'M HAPPY TO REPORT that for the sleep starved , there is a relatively new solution available , and it has nothing to do with that Lunesta butterfly alighting on my brow , nor inviting the Rozerem beaver into bed with me . ( Not that I 'm antidrug ; many sleep docs I spoke with called the current generation of drugs safe and effective , especially when you compare them with the barbiturates that snuffed Marilyn Monroe and Elvis . ) <p> The cure dujour for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) . A 2006 study revealed that it 's as effective as a sedative in inducing sleep . The best news is that , unlike pills , which stop working when you stop swallowing them , CBT encourages sleep long after the sessions have ended . <p> Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lebanon , New Hampshire , is leading the way toward getting more practitioners trained in CBT . The bedroom hell he describes among his insomniac patients has much in common with the one I 've experienced during my worst spells . The bed , he told me , can become a negative place . Instead of evoking warm and relaxing feelings , it can arouse tension and negative expectations . Dr. Sateia told me , " I 've had patients whose hearts literally pounded when they even looked at their beds . " <p> It turns out that one of the biggest enemies here is the otherworldly glow of the alarm clock . Even those dimly glowing numbers can mess with your pineal gland , which is extraordinarily sensitive to light . You see the digits 3:14 a.m. , and it thinks , Sunrise ! The resulting cortisol flow can help fuel the rumination that keeps insomniacs awake until dawn actually comes . The coming of the true dawn is nothing to be trifled with , either . On the floor of the convention hall in Salt Lake City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that produces the Litebook , a lightbulb array he told me could help manage my melatonin levels . " It can give you more energy during the day , " Pedersen told me with evangelical fervor , " and a full burst of melatonin at night , when you really need it . " <p> I was ready to wave him off , until he cited chapter and verse on the studies that show how light of a certain amplitude can manage melatonin levels  --  shutting it down in the morning , so it can build up better in the evening . Bright sunlight will do that . ( Seen any recently ? ) A light box will , too . I took a fair amount of abuse in my office for using one  --  until I recounted the melatonin knockout punch it delivered at night . <p> CBT can also help , by using stimulation control before bed  --  no caffeine within 12 hours of bed , no wine with dinner , and nothing too exciting ( WWE , for instance ) in the bedtime hour . You keep to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedtime to build sleep pressure . You do n't hit the hay until you 're certain it wo n't hit back . <p> Naturally , I arranged for a few CBT sessions myself , and found instant progress with a psychologist named David Glosser , Sc.D. , based in Allentown , Pennsylvania . He proved his bona tides with me when , in the midst of a barrage of personal questions , he asked which side of the bed I sleep on . Before I could answer , he said , " The left . All guys sleep on the left . " He noted that the left arm  --  your free one , when you roll to the right  --  is the hairy , horny one men initiate sex with , because it 's hooked into the hairy , horny right side of the brain . Guilty as charged . <p> Glosser changed my bedtime routine , encouraging me to stay up a little later , so that when I fell into bed , I 'd be more likely to fall straight to sleep . And he asked my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change things up ; now I 'll look forward to her left hook . And he insists that if I 'm not sleeping , I should leave the bed . But not for online poker . Reading time will benefit . The most important thing he did for me , though , was change my outlook toward sleep . He broke my habits of obsession and worry , and helped me just let the night be . In essence , CBT renovated my bedroom , and my attitude , into a zone of relaxation and peace . Just the place for Frankrs bird to settle for an evening , in fact . <p> SO , WHAT HAPPENED TO ME THAT NIGHT , IN Vegas ? I was all psyched up , ready to gamble . I 'd set aside a pot to blow , and approached the roulette wheel , lauded as a simple place to lay down a bet and enjoy the action . But for me , stack after stack vanished into the black hole at the croupier 's elbow . So I moved on to blackjack , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a little luck at it that afternoon , when the stakes were lower . I won a few big hands that night , but soon my chips disappeared . <p> I 'd imagined an all-night session , running up my totals and witnessing the drama of Vegas till dawn . But I 'd busted out before midnight . What to do ? <p> My prefrontal cortex knew the drill . I walked slowly , then with determination , toward the elevators that would carry me upstairs , to my room . I was headed for a good night 's sleep . <p> It 's the surest bet you can make , my fellow gamblers. * SLEEP HURDLES RUNAWAY THOUGHTS <p> THE SOLUTION Count backward by threes . <p> WHY IT WORKS When you ca n't seem to turn off your mind , this distraction forces you to concentrate on something other than your racing thoughts .
