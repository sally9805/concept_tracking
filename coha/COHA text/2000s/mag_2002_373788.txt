Only a printer could love the annual benefits open-enrollment period bearing down on millions of employees . Instruction packets the size of a Sunday newspaper will clog your In box at work very soon , an oppressive reminder of how much you 'll never know when it comes to deductibles , referrals and reimbursables  --  to say nothing of why your schizo doctor switches plans every year . Many wo n't read further than they must , which helps explain why so few  --  just 12% of those given the option  --  enroll in flexible-spending accounts ( FSAs ) . <P> When employees figure out that they 'll lose any pretax money they set aside but do n't spend , most simply move on . Who needs to roll the dice on something so unknowable as how often you 'll get sick next year ? And it 's a slap in the face that your employer gets to keep the leftovers . We 're not talking big bucks  --  roughly $20 a year goes unused in the typical health-care or dependent-care FSA . The real crime is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will overguesstimate expenses . Drop the use-it-or-lose-it rule , and participation would quickly double , says David Wilson , president of FlexBen , a leading FSA administrator . <P> By law employers can not return money to individuals who fail to exhaust their accounts , lest fsas start to look like tax shelters . But companies can give the money back pro rata to everyone in the plan . Almost none do , choosing instead to offset plan administrative costs  --  an outrage that Congress finally noticed last year . <P> Representative Ed Royce , a California Republican , sponsored a bill that would let employees roll over to the next year any unspent money . The idea is not just to encourage participation but to give health-care consumers an incentive to rein in their costs and build health-care savings they can draw upon later . Sadly , Royce 's bill has been stuck in the rules committee for a year . <P> Royce got interested in FSAs two years ago , when his wife bought a pair of glasses she did n't need solely to drain her FSA by year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a late-year boon to ophthalmologists : eye-care expenditures spike in the fourth quarter . If it 's not eyes , it may be an extra dental cleaning or cosmetic surgery . " Use-it-or-lose-it is the worst of all economic incentives , " Royce says . He holds out hope for his bill . President Bush last month approved fsas for all federal employees , and he provides in his budget for participants to roll over as much as $500 a year . <P> Meanwhile , in a little noticed Treasury Department ruling last June , employers were given the O.K. to push ahead with " health-reimbursement arrangements HRAS , " accounts that they fund on behalf of individuals and in which unused funds accumulate year after year . HRAs are n't new . Textron , which labels them " personal-care accounts , " offered them to 3% of its work force last January . What 's new is Treasury 's blessing of the accumulation feature . Starting this January , Textron will expand the benefit to most of its 51,000 employees . Coors and 3M will start a similar program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says FlexBen 's Wilson , who predicts most large companies will set up HRAs in the next few years . The downside : to offset the costs of HRAs , companies will impose significantly higher monthly premiums and deductibles.
