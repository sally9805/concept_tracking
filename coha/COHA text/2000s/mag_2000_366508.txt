If George W. Bush wins the G.O.P. nomination , he may remember the afternoon he spent in the backwoods of upstate South Carolina as the moment he turned his campaign around . It was Thursday , Feb. 10 , and before the weekend began the Bush team desperately wanted to respond to an ad John McCain was airing in which McCain accused Bush of " twisting the truth like Clinton . " The ad gave Bush an opportunity , a chance to take McCain 's biggest selling point  --  his image as an outsider who was above politics as usual  --  and use it against him . <P> The Governor was speaking that afternoon at the Catawba Fish Camp restaurant in Fort Lawn , a place about as out of the way as you can find in the Palmetto State . Mark McKinnon , Bush 's media adviser , flew to Charlotte , N.C. , from Austin and then raced to Fort Lawn at 90 m.p.h. to catch up with Bush and take him to a location about eight miles into the woods for the filming . Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background , he just looked into the camera and delivered his lines . " Politics is tough , " Bush said in a steely voice , " but when John McCain compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was untrustworthy , that 's over the line . Disagree with me , fine , but do not challenge my integrity . " Says McKinnon : " His sincerity was so obvious . He was angry , and he conveyed that . " <P> Getting angry was only part of what made Bush a better candidate in South Carolina . His loss in New Hampshire forced him to step out of his regal motorcade and away from his podium . Despite their calm public faces , everyone on the Bush team , starting with the Governor , knew that a loss in South Carolina would probably mean the end of the campaign . As an aide said , " We had to take some risks . " <P> The biggest risk was holding what seemed an endless series of " one-on-one " sessions between Bush and voters at venues like the Catawba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been protected by the safety of set speeches and surrogates who could speak for him , he was now flying solo . At Newberry , when a black student asked why Bush would n't take a position on the Confederate flag controversy , some white students booed . It was an awkward moment , but Bush did n't panic . He quieted the crowd and insisted that the student had a right to ask his question ( although he continued to give his nonanswer ) . At the same session , a young mother pressed him on the need to teach the Bible in public schools  --  another invitation for Bush to say the wrong thing . " If you 're suggesting that the public school systems take on what the churches ought to be doing , " Bush said , " I do n't agree with that . " <P> Bush was clearly more comfortable answering questions from voters than he has ever been giving speeches , and the format energized him . He would stand in front of the microphone , his body slightly hunched and his arms bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opponent 's best shot . He was able to show off his expertise on education policy and say things like " I 've been a tort-reformin ' Governor and I 'll be a tort-reformin ' President ! " and hear applause in response . " I like this , " he told an adviser . " And I 'm not bad at it either . "
