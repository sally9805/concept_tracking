The first thing you see is a huge white curtain covered from top to bottom with gibberish : TO KNOW TO KNOW TO LOVE HER SO . FOUR SAINTS PREPARE FOR SAINTS . A drummer fires off a stand-up-and-salute roll . Then the orchestra lurches into an off-center waltz ( complete with a wheezing accordion on the oom-pahs ) , and a chorus starts to sing the words painted on the curtain , which flies open to reveal a dozen dancers in Spanish costumes prancing merrily in front of a backdrop that is an explosion of magenta and yellow . Hold on to your ticket stub : Mark Morris ' joyous dance version of Four Saints in Three Acts , the surrealist opera by Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson , is off and galloping . <P> Four Saints , which opened in New York City this month ( it was first seen in London and Berkeley , Calif. , last year ) , was the exuberant centerpiece of the Mark Morris Dance Group 's 20th-anniversary season . Sixteen of the choreographer 's 100-odd dances  --  from L'Allegro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 dancers , four singers , chorus and orchestra , to Peccadillos , a duet for Morris and a toy piano  --  were presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music . Meanwhile , across the street , the company is moving into the brand-new Mark Morris Dance Center , its first permanent home in the dance capital of the world . The $6 million building 's top floor contains one of the biggest rehearsal studios in the U.S. ; there will also be a school open to professionals as well as children from the surrounding economically depressed neighborhood . <P> The five-story building offers a telling symbol for what has happened to the man who used to be known as the Bad Boy of Modern Dance . Openly gay and utterly frank , he wore his hair in a messy mop , tossed off unprintable remarks about his colleagues in a braying class-clown voice , and made startlingly fresh dances whose loose-limbed , heavy-gaited steps ( Morris ' wonderful dancers can look like James Thurber cartoons come to life ) did nothing to conceal his passionately inspired response to music of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Except for the hair ( he cut it , sort of ) , Morris , 44 , is still the same mouthy iconoclast he always was  --  only now his once controversial work has become the gold standard of creativity for a new generation of dancers , choreographers and critics . Charter company members like Tina Fehlandt are currently teaching the gospel of St. Mark to such prestigious ensembles as the American Ballet Theatre and the San Francisco Ballet , both of which commissioned new pieces from Morris this season . He is the subject of a just published coffee-table anthology of essays and interviews about L'Allegro . " Some of my dancers first saw the company on pbs when they were 11 and dreamed of dancing with us when they grew up , " he says bemusedly . " It 's a little strange , this whole thing of how the baby-boom people are now in power . Like kooky Bill Clinton gets elected President , and menopause has become something to be proud of . So who better to be in charge of what I do than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hooray ! "
