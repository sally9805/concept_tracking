100+ MOST INFLUENTIAL In your recent " 100+ Most Influential Black Americans " ( May 2001 ) article , you misidentified the presiding bishop of the Church of God in Christ . He is Bishop G.E . Patterson . CAROLYN SMITH Atlanta , Ga . Editor 's Note : We regret that the new presiding bishop of the Church of God in Christ-Bishop Gilbert Earl ( G.E. ) Patterson-was not properly identified in the " 100+ Most Influential Black Americans " ( May 2001 ) . Bishop Patterson , 61 , was elected last November 14 and the inaugural date was April 16 , 2001 . He has been a minister for 40 years and attended LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis and the Detroit Bible Institute . The Church of God in Christ has more than 8 million members and is the largest Pentecostal religious denomination in America . Photograph Bishop G.E . Patterson // TERRY McMILLAN After reading the article , " Exhaling ! Terry McMillan Hits Jackpot In Romance And Finance " ( April 2001 ) , I 'm reminded that she is truly one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alice Walkers and Toni Morrisons paved the way , but Terry has also opened doors for other African-American writers . She deserves credit , too . Because tragedy can strike at any time , we must learn to choose our own course of happiness . We must learn to love , to do good and enjoy life . If by some chance Terry shrivels up , I hope Jonathan will continue to love her spirit and sense of humor . There are no guarantees of always and forever , so make the moment count , and keep your heart in it . BOBBIE D. CARR De Soto , Texas MAN-SHARING The article , " Why Some Women Settle For Man-Sharing And The Dangerous Consequences " ( April 2001 ) , is one of the best " tell it like it is " articles I have ever read . Unfortunately , some of the women and men who read this article wo n't take heed to the truth . Some women are in denial that they fit into the category that Dr. Chapman has described . So many women are afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nothing worse than being married and feeling alone , whether it is because the husband 's never home , or when he is home , there is no communication . There is no justification for having an affair or man-sharing . There is nothing wrong with abstinence . It is true that some women are on an emotional roller-coaster ride , but at some point , they have to get off before it crashes . Being spiritually connected is the utmost relationship that two people can enter into . Sometimes we base our feelings on our desires and fears-the desire to have a man and the fear that if we do n't have sex with him that he wo n't stay . Women need to understand that if a man does n't stay , it 's not because she did n't have sex with him ; it 's because he was n't looking for a " Godly " woman anyway . If two people are spiritually connected , they will know it , and it 's not the sex that connects them or keeps them connected . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte , N.C. A SUPREME GOES TO COLLEGE Thank you very much , EBONY , for your article , " A Supreme Goes To College " ( April 2001 ) , on my favorite entertainer , Mary Wilson . I have been a fan of hers for years . I am so proud of Mary Wilson for reaching her goal of receiving her college degree . It is amazing how she managed to get a degree and continue her busy music career . I have loved her ever since her days as one of the original Supremes . As your article showed , Mary Wilson of today is smart , talented and beautiful . I can not wait to see her in Sophisticated Ladies . EBONY , now I am a bigger fan of yours than before . Thanks again for your story on the beautiful and talented Mary Wilson . I enjoyed it very much . DONNELL GRAVES Cambridge , Mass . LIL ' BOW WOW I thank God for Teresa Caldwell and the very inspirational article , " Lil " Bow Wow 's Bark &; Bite " ( April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's will , and a credit to this young man 's proper upbringing , that Bow Wow is capable of performing with style and tasteful lyrics , mastering an art form with such great success at such a youthful age . He is , without a doubt , the image of hope for our troubled youth . At 13 years of age , his peers who adore Bow Wow all over the world are numbered in the millions . And that number is equally as great among the parents of his fans who are thankful Bow Wow expresses his art the way he has chosen . He dared to be different . And his creativity showed us that one does not always have to be vulgar to be successful in this business . Bow Wow has proven that the market is flexible , if not changeable . Vulgarity , profanity and the very outdated , last-decade use of demoralizing women is a distasteful " crutch " for the obviously less talented , and less creative individuals who " dare not " to be different . I wish you all the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're " The Man . " J.L. GREENHOW Memphis , Tenn . FOR BROTHERS ONLY I 'm writing this letter in reference to the " For Brothers Only " column titled , " Are You Afraid Of A Successful Sister ? " ( April 2001 ) . I want to thank you for this article because it was very informative and interesting . It helped me to understand why Black men view a woman 's professional and personal success in a negative way . This article was right on time because , this summer , my girlfriend 's summer job pays more than mine . When she first told me about the job and the wages , I was really happy and supportive . But as I thought about the money she would be making , I did feel my " male ego " drop because of my new financial role . That 's why reading this article was vital for me to grasp . It gave me a real positive and realistic way of going about the situation . The article makes some good points about approaching the successful women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women having an established role in society . When we come to realizing the truth , I believe we all will handle it better . Brothers , let 's use these new roles in the relationship to our advantage . This article exemplifies this thinking by providing examples . This made the article funny , but it was also making some good points . Overall , the reading helped change my perception of being in a relationship with a successful Sister . MICHAEL CANNON Carbondale , Ill. 10 MOST POWERFUL BLACK WOMEN After reading about Condoleezza Rice in the article , " The 10 Most Powerful Black Women " ( March 2001 ) , a couple of things came to mind . First , I would like to give her due respect for being a strong Sister who has broken the oppressive " glass ceiling " that has always been over Black professionals ' heads . Although she is in a prominent position proving that Blacks can excel in high places , she and Colin Powell are focusing their work outside the U.S. Blacks with their influence and power should concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education .
