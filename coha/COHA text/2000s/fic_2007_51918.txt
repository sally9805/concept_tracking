Readers with strong memories for names might recall Mr. Durbin as the author of " The Place of Roots " in our February 2001 issue . His short fiction has also appeared in Weird Tales and in the magazines for younger readers , Cricket and Cicada . His 1999 novel , Dragonfly , is set around Hallowe'en-as is his new story , in which a stranger comes to town on the wrong day .... <p> IT WAS HUNGER THAT MADE Conlin turn off the route . At least , hunger is what he decided to call the sensation , a growing restlessness that pulled his gaze to the exit sign , that made him search in erratic , highway-driver glances for what might lie behind the billboards and guardrails . It would be just more empty fields , he knew ; but he wanted to be down among them now , and to find a place to fill his stomach . The T intersection at the ramp 's bottom gave no hint which way led to civilization ; the blacktop to the left actually looked more promising-wider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Conlin turned right and headed east along a gravel-popping oil road . He was going on instinct , which had never failed him yet . Something about the dusty forest bottomland in that direction beckoned him , the trees vivid in their autumnal colors . Rutted pastures , sagging wire fences , water troughs streaked with rust-landscapes like this never changed , not in the thirty-odd years since Nixon had resigned , not ever . Under a hot midday sun , pigs wallowed in mud on Conlin 's left . One stood against the weed-grown fence and flared its nostrils as he drove by . Creepy animals , pigs , especially the big ones - lots of brain behind those beady eyes . The road undulated like a roller coaster , each dip getting lower as it descended to a hidden creek somewhere beneath the **26;3523;TOOLONG masses of the trees " crowns . Conlin liked low places , the woody , forgotten corners that were hard to see into , hard to get into . Those were useful places , not that he needed one now . This was pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond the first thicket of trees . No usual green sign announced the name , but it was n't worth reaching for the map . Standing astride the community was a telltale water tower , dull silver and rusting on its legs like one of H. G. Wells 's abandoned Martian machines . No name painted there , either . Conlin toggled his drivers-side window down a couple inches , letting in the cool air . Even behind the smells of hogs and dust , it had a purity , clean as the pale light on trees going to sleep . Conlin knew why he 'd taken the exit . It was n't just about food . Little towns reminded him of where he 'd grown up . Home - the concept no longer held much meaning , certainly no nostalgia . But he guessed the porches and the alleys never really left you ; you never stopped hearing the rattle of boxcars and the slam of their couplings . He liked to drive through these places now and then to see that they still existed . He had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , a few hours " sleep , and then a steady focus on driving . No point racing back to Chicago . The job had gone well . He 'd found Enfield-it was on the map if you looked close . The road climbed . An International Harvester truck loomed at the hill 's crest , as suddenly as if the Earth had opened up and disgorged it . Conlin swerved slightly to the right , the weeds brushing his fender . The truck 's driver raised a hand amiably and was gone in a puff of diesel fumes and scattering pebbles . Country people usually waved , not that they trusted you . Hi . Hey . Howdy . As a rule , Conlin avoided getting out in small towns , but he 'd come quite a way since Enfield , and old Cooper would n't even be officially missing for about five days . Cooper was " on a fishing trip . " Cooper had made it easy . Thought he was safe in Enfield , but you were n't safe anywhere . Now Cooper was inside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with big field rocks at the bottom of a creek much like the one ahead . The plastic would last forever - that was the beauty of plastic . Cooper would n't last , though . Conlin thought of catfish nibbling on the old man and then being caught and served up themselves on dinner tables , in the diners . That notion should n't be so amusing . Tapping the brakes , Conlin guided the Malibu down onto a one-lane bridge across a muddy creek . Like the water tower , the bridge was old-style : riveted girder rails no higher than the car 's windows , and uniformly rusted to a pitted orange-red ; raised tracks for the car 's wheels , sun-bleached timbers with a gravel bed between . The hog-wallow stream wandered out of the pasture to the north and away under the gloomy woods to the south . It was a perfect day , one of those midfall days when the sky seemed to be having a clearance sale on sunlight , Everything Must Go . Not a cloud insight . Conlin flinched at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression of someone standing just at the roadside , maybe some old farmer about to lurch across without a thought in the world for oncoming cars . But no one was there . It had probably been a trick of the tree shadows and the long banner rippling beyond , on the verge where the forest made way for the town . He blinked at the banner . It was fixed to four stakes and had black letters on its billowing orange length : PARADE FRIDAY 7:00 Parade . Today was Friday . Conlin smirked in recognition . Hallowe'en , the holiday when it was suddenly okay to lurk in the shadows and watch the world through the eyeholes of your mask . The sign did n't say " Hallowe'en . " It did n't have to . The occasion was obvious from the date and the colors . Conlin felt a tickle of impulse-why hurry back , indeed ? He could eat a leisurely lunch , then hang around until dark . See a parade . Take life slow . Smell the flowers . Hallowe'en was the only holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't about all the noble , altruistic feelings people pretended to have ; it was n't about the supreme Beings they dreamed up and tailored to their needs . It was about the two realities , masquerading and death . Houses : big ones stood out on the flat horizon , flanked by barns , sheds , vehicles , a few tall trees . But here in the town the houses clustered thickly , some one-storied , some two- . Porches on most . Huge old oaks and elms in the yards , leaning over the shingled roofs . Conlin kept the speedometer needle hovering at about twenty m.p.h. , then came to a full stop at each corner when stop signs appeared , the branches neatly trimmed away from them . People took no notice of the sedan gliding down their main drag - Grand Avenue . Conlin gave a low whistle at how " Grand " it was . Grain elevator towering off to the right , and yes , the inevitable train tracks ... convenience store with gas pumps ... even a red flashing stoplight suspended above an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier swung along a root-buckled sidewalk , toting a heavy bag . Two old men leaned in under the raised hood of a pickup truck in a driveway . A sloppily parked tricycle with pink streamers on the handle-bars proclaimed to the world a little girl lives here . Conlin was enjoying his theory of Hallowe'en . The honest holiday - the primeval dance that was human existence : We wear masks . We collect and eat candy . We die . Street signs , blue with white letters - ELEVATOR , ASH , CHEROKEE - but no town name . NO WELCOME TO BIRDPITT , POPULATION 5,000 sign . Had it been hidden behind the orange banner advertising the parade ? A low-key town , not giving up more than it needed to . Conlin slowed to a crawl through a school zone , although the kids were all inside . Hallowe'en afternoon , and a Friday to boot : they were probably having parties now , one in each classroom , eating cookies with orange icing and then parading around the school halls in those shiny , slick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and cartoon likeness emblazoned across the front . Right . As if the Wolfman ran around in a shirt that said THE WOLFMAN . The full moon ... the Change coming on ... a registered trademark symbol ... forming on my chest .... Har-de-har . There was n't even a town name on the school . Hardware store , post office , electronics ( well-stocked with them new-fangled telly-vision sets ) , JASON 'S GAME WORLD - ROLE-PLAYING GAMES PLAYED HERE ! Ooo , role-playing . A couple taverns with neon beer signs in the windows ... liquor store , barber shop . There 'd be at least one old-timer parked in the barber 's waiting-chair , no intention of getting a haircut . Conlin wondered if barbers in places like this still painted your neck with lather from a little round soap-brush ; if they still used those lethal straight razors and sharpened them on leather strops . Here . STACY 'S KITCHEN . Retired farmers would be gathered in there around enormous platefuls of things fried in grease , everyone wearing bill caps indoors . It would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main street , but Conlin turned a corner onto WALNUT and parallel-parked in front of a silver Ford pickup along the restaurant 's two-story brick side . Rolling up the window , he glanced around . Twenty feet in front of him were a green Dumpster and the alley . Across Walnut stood another aging brick building that looked abandoned . An etched concrete slab over the door said DAILY NEWS . That 's why it 's abandoned . Could n't be much " daily news " around here . No parking meters - just a sign forbidding parking in the small hours of the morning . He stretched beside the car , easing the kinks out of his legs and back , enjoying the sun 's warmth . On the cracked wall of the restaurant , someone had spray-painted FERG IS HOT ! ! ! in white letters a foot high . A few paces to the right was FERG + DIANE inside a lopsided valentine heart . Pressing the button on his keychain , he watched the knobs of the door-locks go down with four simultaneous whunks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cars . In another couple days , this one would be clean and gone : new plates , maybe even a new color , and for sale on one of Jank 's lots somewhere between sea and shining sea . Conlin slid his left hand into the side pocket of his gray sportcoat , tucking his arm close against the concealed hardware in the shoulder holster . He was used to the bulk - a Glock 18 , not the smallest of its line , not particularly made for concealment . But it suited Conlin fine . He did n't mess around with silencers . If you had to silence a shot , you were n't in control of your environment . He would n't be needing the piece here , but he was n't going to leave it in the trunk , not even in broad daylight . A car could be stolen , vandalized , or towed because of some pissant city ordinance unique to Spudville - Conlin might be parked in a " graffiti zone " or something . Graffiti ... closer to the corner with Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this one in a darker hue , a purplish blue that made Conlin think it might glow in the dark . The two words were faded , the bricks around them bleached-looking , as if someone had tried to scrub the vandalism away . LUCAFER RULES . Lucafer . It did n't take Conlin long to formulate a response in the same language : Now , now . Your going to make Jeasis mad . Shucks , if only he had a spray can . Across Grand , three women were browsing a sidewalk sale in front of a dollar store . Dumpy , small-town women , one wearing ill-advised shorts that showcased a lot of pasty , cellulite-jiggling flesh . Conlin scanned the parked cars and pickups along both sides of the street - looking for nothing in particular , not dreading the presence of cop cars ( there were none ) - just being aware of what was where . A guy with a green baseball cap jammed low on his head went into the liquor store . A portly , silver-haired man in a suit emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conlin . A splash of color drew Conlin 's gaze to a telephone pole . At eye-level hung an ad for the parade , black letters on bright orange paper . Before the words , his attention went to the picture in the center : a skeleton , a black silhouette , one arm and one knee raised . Dancing . HALLOWE'EN PARADE , FRIDAY , OCTOBER 31ST , 7:00 P.M. This one said " Hallowe'en . " And in smaller print , below the figure : Will commence and conclude in the V.F.W. south lot . Awards ceremony to follow . A tiny map in the bottom corner showed the parade route , a square loop four blocks on a side . Conlin checked the street names and got his bearings . It would be simple to find . He was sure it would be the only thing going on in town tonight . More of the orange papers , identical , hung on poles and in store windows all along the street . The skeleton was an interesting motif , an unusual choice - not a jack-o ' - lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing the full moon on her broom . A skeleton . The skull 's eyes and triangular nose were simply the orange of the paper showing through , but they suggested a glowing , infernal light inside , like a jack-o ' - lantern 's flame . The mouth was an exaggerated comb-like grid of orange lines . The image triggered a memory ... the memory of a book he 'd read in early grade school ; a book of spooky poems , a different standby Hallowe'en creature on every page . Werewolf , vampire , mummy , witch ... the one he 'd never forgotten was the skeleton . The illustration , done in creepy black-and-white , showed an animate skeleton in a boy 's bedroom-clearly at night , with a bright moon outside the open window . The kid was freaked out , trying to hide under the covers but unable to look away from his nightmarish visitor . And Conlin , as a kid , had been unable to look away . The skeleton was just standing there , close enough to touch , but not reaching out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the kid . Just standing , standing . No skin , no rags of clothing - just two or three wisps of hair stuck to the skull , wiggly black lines like rising fumes . What would a skeleton do to a kid , anyway ? Maybe that was part of the horror , that you could n't imagine what it wanted , why it had come . Conlin blinked at the poster , thinking of that long-ago book . He remembered the poem on that page , word for word : John is a skeleton , John is dead , All bony fingers , Bony head ; No life in him , Not a breath . Lazy in life , He 's restless in death . All bony fingers , Bony head - Hope he 's not standing By your bed ! Shaking his head , Conlin chuckled aloud . They probably would n't allow a book like that in a school nowadays . He winked at the skeleton and turned toward Stacy 's Kitchen . He was going to have fun here . The door was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass plate , - instead of a crash-bar or a flange , it had a cast-iron handle with an actual thumb-latch , curved to fit your thumb like a tiny black potato chip . As Conlin gripped it , his eyes picked out a handwritten sign taped up inside the door 's glass . No more than a card among bigger , fancier announcements of restaurant hours , an upcoming country music concert , a circus , and someone with a set of wrenches to give away , it grabbed his gaze because of the first two words : BONE MAN POSTCARDS HERE . The lunch crowd had thinned ; it was past 1:30 . Conlin pushed the door closed behind him with a click . The smell of the grill mingled with the essences of coffee , cigarettes , and some lemony soap that must be what the waitress wiped the tables with . A ring of customers who could only be regulars lounged around a table to the right , up by the counter : three stocky men and a woman , all past middle-age . They noted Conlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how " Barb " was going to " find out a thing or two . " The woman nodded sagely , one of the men shook his head and stubbed a cigarette , and another spasmed with laughter , making his belly bounce . To Conlin 's left , two youngish men were chewing seriously , facing each other across a table . Not farmers , but not office workers , either . The older , thirty-something , with pale blond hair and a dark suntan , was eating a salad . The younger , maybe twenty-five , wore a polo shirt and held a heavily loaded burger . They nodded at Conlin and he nodded back as he passed them to take a table about equidistant from both parties , against the wall opposite the door . No booths here , just Formica-topped tables and a bar with stools . Conlin faced the bar and read through the day 's specials penned in blue on a whiteboard . Brat with onions , no thank you . Beef tips ... " fish sand . " - of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " w/fryes . " Setting his elbows on the table , he tented his fingers . The woman in the regulars " group leaned back in her chair and called through the oblong window into the kitchen . " Peg , you 've got someone here . " Conlin heard the clink of dishes , a rubbery noise that sounded like a plunger , and at least two people conversing . Peg appeared from the kitchen doorway , drying her hands on a towel . " Thanks , " she said to the woman . " That thing 's backed up again . " The woman chopped her hand sideways through the air as if cutting off any discussion . " Call Tom . Just call Tom . " " Yeah . " Peg came a few steps in Conlin 's direction , chubby and young , little round glasses , short brown hair in tight curls . She had a longsuffering look , a reddish nose . " Would you like to see a menu ? " " Uh , no , thanks . " Conlin folded his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What would you like on it ? " Good . Sand meant " sandwich , " not actual sand . " Um , tartar sauce ? Onion ? " Conlin was also entitled to two sides in addition to the " fryes . " He opted for corn and a cup of chicken-rice soup . And coffee - black coffee . Ten minutes passed . The two serious guys paid their bill and left . Conlin sipped his coffee and half-listened to the regular woman carrying on about how she 'd explained it all to Jerry , how if he wanted to keep a job he 'd have to show up and care . The coffee was good . Peg refilled the cup when she brought Conlin 's food . The bun tasted wholesome and oaty , the fish tender , not oily . As he shook pepper into the soup , the regulars were beginning to leave : first the big-bellied man in overalls , then the chain smoker . Then the woman , promising over her shoulder that she 'd ask Vicky something about a broiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright red ballcap , his back to Conlin . Spooning corn , Conlin watched him . The man seemed to be nodding off . His head had a whitish cast overall , as if whiteness had leached into his skin from his close-shaved , glistening hair . He kept drooping forward , then jerking awake ; his head , topped with the red cap , reminded Conlin of a fishing bobber . Peg warmed up the man 's coffee , then Conlin 's . When she started reloading the napkin holders , Conlin had to ask . " I 'm curious . Who or what is Bone Man ? " Pee cracked a smile-the first smile Conlin had seen on her . And the old man was awake now , turning laboriously in his chair to study Conlin with vividly blue eyes . " He 's a local ... celebrity ? " ( Peg pronounced it " celeberty . " ) " What would you call him , Billy ? " She looked at Conlin and tipped her head toward the old man . " We got an expert here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was sitting sideways now , bony knees in his canvas pants stuck off the side of his chair . He looked about eighty , the skin hanging loose beneath his clean-shaved chin . " Phenomenon , " he said in a soft voice , not strong but steady . He pushed the cap back a little from his wrinkled forehead and spoke slowly , seeming to think about each of the words , laying them out like treasures from a shoebox . " He 's a hero and a boogeyman . Some say a ghost . Some say the Devil himself . " Conlin leaned forward , telling Billy with his expression to go on . " Comes around every year for the Parade . A dancing skeleton , just like on the posters . " Conlin thought of a Christmas parade he 'd been to as a kid , at the end of which Santa Claus had parachuted out of a plane and landed with a Ho , ho , ho to the delight of the crowd . He supposed this was something like that . " Sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . " Billy shook his head , emphasizing the oh more than the no . " No , we respect the Bone Man . We love him , but he scares us . Or maybe that 's why we love him . He 's lots older than the town . " " He ai n't alive , " Peg said helpfully . " He 's all bones . He 's paranormal . " Conlin smiled broadly , looking from one to the other and back , waiting for a punchline . But Billy only watched him , and Peg went back to stuffing napkin holders . The Bone Man was this town 's gimmick , and these two were good at presenting it . " So he 's a paranormal phenomenon , " Conlin said , " who appears every year at the Hallowe'en Parade . " " That 's right , " Billy said . " Only not everyone can see him . " Conlin snorted and quickly tried to make it sound like a cough . How convenient was that ? A ghost with an up-front disclaimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your problem . The local tourism council was brilliant . " Good thing you 've got him on postcards . " Billy chuckled . " You coming to the Parade ? " " Would n't miss it . " Billy nodded knowingly . " Folks go all out for it . It 's something to see , even if you ca n't see the Bone Man . " Fact , I would n't be sorry if you ca n't . " " Why do you say that ? " Aside from the obvious reason of covering your behind . " Well .... " Billy 's gaze drifted . " seems folks who ca n't see him at all are generally happier than those that can . " " Does seeing him , like , bring a curse ? Like hearing a banshee scream ? " " No . No , I do n't mean that , exactly . 7 can see him , and I do n't consider myself cursed . It 's just .. . like what the Bible says about how if you increase your knowledge , you increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible pretty well . His parents had ripped and wallowed their way through it along with everything else abusable . There were highs to be had from power and even guilt . But Conlin had given the Church a fair hearing . He was nothing if not methodical . " You see him , " Billy said , " and then you tend to see a lot of things you might prefer to ignore . The Bone Man is ... a heavy truth . " " Well . " Conlin sat back and finished his coffee . " I wonder if I 'll see him . " " There 's a way to find out . " " You mean by coming to the parade , right ? " " I mean right now . " Right now . A watery coldness gurgled low in Conlin 's stomach . The last time he 'd felt it was once when he 'd realized the mark he was about to move on was also carrying . Like finding a snake in your bed . But why should this idea unsettle him ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peg stepped around the bar and picked up a heavy scrapbook of some kind from a shelf of curios and phone books . She brought it to Conlin 's table . Billy shuffled over and sat in the chair across from Conlin . Peg once more replenished their coffee , cleared away the dishes , and went into the kitchen . With wizened hands , Billy turned the book to face Conlin . THE BOOK OF THE BONE MAN . It was cheap , wirebound , double-wide , the posterboard cover hand-lettered in garish orange marker . The words were scrunched up toward the right edge , the result of poor planning . Below the title , Hallowe'en figures had been drawn by many different artists with finer felt-tips of various colors . It was obviously a depiction of the Parade . Some of the creatures were done by children 's hands and were mostly scribbles , some dripping blood , some with fangs and yellow eyes . A bipedal werewolf brandished a big cartoon bone . Other images seemed to be the work of teens or preteens , mean-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the huge , innocent eyes of Japanese manga . Still other beings were etched with painstaking skill , shaded and three-dimensional , lunging off the cover . Conlin looked questioningly at Billy . " Open it . " Billy hunched forward on crossed arms . Conlin lifted the cover and laid it open . More of the drawings crowded the title page , where the same title was spaced better , in bold black this time , the letters arranged on lines drawn with the aid of a ruler . The next leaf burst with multicolored scrawls on both facing pages , left and right . Pictures gave way to a sort of graffiti on the Bone Man theme - messages by dozens of people . BONE MAN RULES ! FAN OF THE MAN . WE SAW THE BONE MAN , " 98 - THE ROBERT LYNCH FAMILY , SAUK CITY , WI . FAR OUT , BONES ! - AN OSTEOPHILE , 1999 . And under that one : DUDE , THIS BOOK is AN OSTEOFILE ! - DUNCAN , 11-1-99 . It reminded Conlin of graffiti books he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haunted houses turned into hotels - diaries in which guests were encouraged to leave their own messages . Conlin wondered if the " Lucafer " disciple had signed the book , or the person who thought Ferg was hot . But this could n't be for real - he saw at least fifteen different state names on this two-page spread alone . He rubbed his chin . " You 're telling me that tourists flock here every year for Hallowe'en ? " " We do n't advertise . We like our peace and quiet . No souvenir shops - just a few postcards , " cause people kept asking for something they could buy and take home . " He shrugged . " We do n't mind a little company , if folks know how to conduct themselves . Somehow , they turn up . " He grinned at Conlin . " Like you did . " " I did n't know about the ... I 'm just on my way through . " " Yeah . I hear that a lot . " Conlin actually felt his scalp prickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling up with people - hungry , like he 'd been , or lost , or with car trouble , or just needing a tank of gas . He thought of the two sober-faced men who 'd been in here . Were they out-of-towners ? Mmm-hmm , sure . This was all part of the story , the mood-setting for the parade . What else did old guys like this have to do all day but get very , very good at spinning the tale ? It probably got better every year . The best explanation was that someone from town had been down to Mexico and thought the Day of the Dead was really cool . Most likely , five or six locals had gone hog-wild with a pack of markers and made this whole scrapbook on a rainy Saturday afternoon . " This is a new book , you see , " Billy said . " It starts in " 98 . Stacy 's got boxfuls of them in back-older ones . And this is n't the only place in town that keeps a Bone Man book . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been part of it . " With a yellowed fingernail , Billy tapped an entry in purple ink . " Here 's one that could n't see him . " BEEN HERE , DONE TMS , DID N'T SEE SQUAT ! - JIM , NEBRASKA , Nov. " 99 . " Another here , " Billy said . VENI , NON VIDI ! BONE MAN IS A WE'ENIE ! That one was n't signed . Conlin nodded . " You give nonbelievers their fair say . " " Yep . " Billy sucked his lips inward around his teeth and released them with a smack . " Now we come to the first picture . " He flipped back the next page for Conlin , revealing , amid the almost dizzying sprawl of words and little sketched skulls a single photograph , glued to the right-hand page in about the middle , near the outside edge . One photo in a sea of Technicolor inscriptions . Conlin bent closer . The picture showed a wooden fence across half its length ; a house behind the fence ; people in costumes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bicycle just going out of the frame on the left . " You see him ? " asked Billy . Conlin saw no skeleton . He felt a twinge of disappointment . What had he been expecting ? " Do n't worry . He 's hard to see in this one . " Billy moved a finger toward the page with dramatic slowness , letting its tip hover over the people in masks , the bicycle wheel , the branches of a dusky tree in the yard . " He 's right ... there . " At the top of the wooden fence , where the pickets ended in points , like a stockade fort , was a grayish shadow . A curve , like the bottom of an upturned bowl . " He 's hiding behind that fence . That 's the top of his head . " Without moving his face , Conlin raised his eyes to stare back at Billy from under his brows . So the whole thing was a joke , like showing someone a piece of blank white paper and saying it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the old man 's expression showed not the slightest hint of leg-pulling . " Now , I know , this one would n't convince anyone , " Billy said . " It 's just in here to get you ready for what you 're about to see . " He glanced at Conlin with the tip of his tongue poised between his teeth , an expectant glitter in his eyes . Conlin wondered how many times the old man had said these exact same words to others , here in this lunchroom , right here at this table . " And it 's also included , " Billy went on , " to show how the Bone Man is always a part of our landscape , whether you see him or not . " Conlin gnawed his lip . This was sounding more and more like a religion . " Now , see how you like these apples . " Billy flipped over one more page . It half-folded and then flopped wide under its weight of photographs . One of Conlin 's most useful skills was a mastery over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine-millimeter bore ; had squinted into cops " flashlight beams with a mark in his trunk and talked his way past . But something about this two-page spread in a cluttered scrapbook hit him like a cold shovel-blade in the gut . Prickles ran across the back of his neck , and his eyes darted from picture to picture . These were all fairly recent photos , taken with different cameras most in color , standard-sized , but a couple were black-and-white " artsy " shots , playing up the stark shadows . Parade stills . Lines of costumed people walking , riding truckbeds , leering through makeup and masks . They clutched broomsticks and steadied pointed hats against the wind , trailed dirty bandages , cradled plastic machine guns and axes , sported dagger headbands and bloody sheets . Relatively few of the store-bought , media tie-in costumes - and as many adults were present as children , maybe more . And somewhere in every picture , usually quite prominent , was a capering human skeleton . A bone man . Conlin felt himself frown . However the town 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Conlin searched for the wires , the rigging boom on some nearby tractor or float . But no , the skeleton clearly was n't something just dangling . It was in too many poses , arms and legs in all manner of articulate positions ... and it was all over the place , now in a lawn , now in the parade 's center , now balancing on a fence . In one eerie , half-comical shot , it crouched on a rooftop , playing a violin . Conlin brushed his fingertips across the emulsion . He could see no incongruity , no difference in quality between the figure and its surroundings . These prints were nothing like the bogus images of gigantic fish in flatbed trucks , of farmers sitting atop mammoth pumpkins . Most of the photos were too old to be digital . In some , the Bone Man cast a shadow consistent with those of other figures . In many , the gruesome phantom was interacting with people - stretching knobby digits hungrily toward a kid dressed as a bunch of grapes , tap-dancing beside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager in military camouflage . Nobody in any photo was actually touching the Bone Man , though they obviously saw and made space for him . In the faces not covered by masks , Conlin read a somber respect - and in some cases , what looked like fear . " What you do n't see , " said Billy , his sudden voice making Conlin 's hand jump , ever so slightly , " is anyone in a skeleton costume . You just do n't see them around here . No one wants to step on the Bone Man 's toes . " Conlin drew a long breath and scratched his ear . " This is good . I 've got to tell you , I ca n't see how it 's done . It 's a real figure of some kind , not a lab trick . " " Yep , " Billy said , smiling placidly as he surveyed the photos himself . " He 's real , all right . " Rubbing a palm over his mouth and jaw , Conlin examined the scribbled entries on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNBELIEVERS ! shouted one inscription , a scrawled arrow pointing from the margin directly at the Bone Man . HE 'S RIGHT THERE ! The pictures convinced Conlin that , whatever the Bone Man was , he was neither a mass hallucination nor anything as simple as a local tall tale . The folk around Loch Ness did n't have dozens of perfectly clear pictures of their Monster - yet Nessie was world-famous . " Why have n't I heard of the Bone Man ? " Conlin asked . " All these people who 've seen him .... Why does n't the word get out ? " " Now , there 's a real good question . " Billy leaned back in his chair and stretched his old frame , lacing his fingers behind his head . " I used to wonder about that myself . Folks turn up in droves to see the Parade , and there 's no ban on cameras . Thing is , I think the Bone Man likes to keep himself quiet . " " How can he do that ? " " Tell you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to bowl with him . He lived down here for a couple years - worked with us out at the elevator . He could see the Bone Man - came to the Parade at least twice that I recall , back in the early eighties . Well , he moved back up there - had property , I think , in that place that has the nuke'ular power plant . " " Clinton , " offered Conlin . " Yep , that 's it . Anyway , just happened I ran into him at the state fair about seven or eight years ago . He knew me real well , asked about all his old buddies , and we got to talking . " Billy slid forward on his elbows , his shirt making a dry rustle across the Formica . Again , his eyes riveted Conlin 's . " I do n't know what brought it up , but when we started reminiscing about the Parade , he did n't iemembei the Bone Man . " Conlin felt another chill . " What do you mean , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just plain did n't remember , like he had this big blank in his memory , like those black hole things out in space . " Billy 's finger returned to a photo , and he touched the Bone Man . " Like the people who ca n't see him . They look at this picture , and they see all these other folks standing around nothing , looking at nothing . I said to this guy , " You know , the Bone Man , " and he says , " Oh , was there something like that ? " I said , " You took about a million pictures , " and he said , " I do n't remember any pictures of anything like that . ' " Now Conlin could n't stifle a laugh . " So all these people come here and see him , and when they drive away , they do n't remember a Bone Man , and their pictures do n't show him ? " Billy nodded . " I think that 's how it works . Maybe some do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man likes his privacy . " " Yeah . " Conlin rocked his head , popping his neck . " What about all these postcards you sell ? Do they go blank at the edge of town ? " Billy shrugged . " I never tried sending one . " Conlin checked his watch . Already going on three . It had been years since he 'd spent this long over lunch . " Well , it 's been fascinating . I appreciate it . " " Seen enough ? " asked Billy , indicating the open scrapbook . " Not nearly enough . " Conlin pulled out his wallet . " I can hardly wait for seven o'clock . " Billy smiled . " You 'll want to come a little early and find a good spot . " Conlin left a generous tip for Peg . He 'd been well-supplied with coffee , not to mention the entertainment . This whole town was just the sort of diversion he 'd been looking for . He might as well enjoy it to the fullest - soak in all the creepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good night 's sleep . " Is there a motel ? " he asked Billy , who 'd begun paging through The Book of the Bone Man for himself . " Two . The Nite-Lite and Metzger 's , both out on Lueders . It 's the last road running north and south at the west edge of town . " " Think they 'll have a vacancy , with all the crowds for the parade ? " Billy seemed absorbed in the album . " Oh , they can probably find you something . " Conlin pushed back his chair and , in an uncharacteristic gesture , stuck out his hand for Billy to shake . " Thanks again for the .... " He was n't sure what to call it . Local color ? Billy shook . His old hand felt like twigs dipped in wax . Halfway to the cash register , Conlin paused , on a sudden inspiration examining the check , then pulling a laminated , finger-smudged menu from another table . He was n't worried about Peg 's math-he was looking for an address . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , turning back toward Billy , " what 's the name of this town ? " Billy glanced up and answered matter-of-factly , saying a name that satisfied Conlin 's curiosity-some perfectly natural name for a little burg lost in the beanf ields - but by the time Conlin had gotten to the register , he 'd forgotten it . He blinked and opened his mouth , but would feel like an idiot asking again . That 's how it works . The thought rolled over him like an icy wave from an open freezer . Drive out of here , and a mile down the road you 've forgotten the whole town . No , Conlin did n't think so . He used the restroom - clean and dim , but the doorknob seemed about to fall off then looked at Bone Man postcards as Peg approached from the kitchen . " Everything okay ? " she asked , receiving the check with a pudgy hand . " Everything perfect . " Conlin opened his wallet and paid with small , unremarkable bills . " That guy did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Billy and impaled the check on the spindle . " Not at all . He 's got me stoked , actually . " " The Parade ? You 'll love it . " Conlin normally did n't linger in such situations , did n't give cashiers or store clerks any reason to look twice at him . But he could n't resist browsing through the postcards . A few were an artist 's rendition of the dancing skeleton , done in a quirky , old-time Hallowe'en style that appealed to Conlin . One was a close-up photo of an ad poster for the parade - taken in a different year , since in the picture Hallowe'en was n't on a Friday , but a Wednesday . Apparently it did n't matter if the parade came on a school night , a work night , whenever : it was always on the thirty-first . The cards in the top few pockets of the wire rack were photographs of the actual Bone Man , much like the pictures in the album . Conlin ended up buying one of every card . Peg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no logo , and Conlin slid them into the side pocket of his sportcoat . THE SILVER PICKUP was gone from behind his car , and no other vehicle had replaced it . Instead of returning to the car , Conlin strolled for a couple blocks along Grand Avenue , breathing the autumnal air . He caught the faint smell of a bonfire , probably someone burning leaves in a backyard , carrying them to a smoky pile with a gloved hand clamping them against a broom rake . Conlin imagined the pile crackling as the flames burst through from below . The smell reminded him of football games , jack-o ' - lanterns , evenings of deepening shadow , the taste of candy corn .... Three blocks from Stacy 's Kitchen , he found what he was looking for : a drive-through bank with a phone booth in one corner of the lot , next to the ATM . Public phones were getting harder to find these days - and of those that remained , fewer and fewer actually worked . But Conlin despised cellulars . He preferred to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own terms . There was something satisfying something almost romantic - about finding a phone and making a call when the job was done . Also , not being able to reach him made his clients nervous . That was a plus , too . He dialed the number , listened for instructions , and dropped in the coins . Two rings , and the sound of the receiver being lifted halfway through the third . Silence on the other end , a silence that demanded the caller to do the talking . " Mr. Kline ? " " No , " said a cold , refined voice . " This is Mr. Cyrus . Who is calling , please ? " Fine . Cyrus was Kline 's assistant , fully authorized to take this message . Conlin spoke clearly , smoothly , watching his surroundings through the booth 's glass walls . " This is Jack , calling from the house in Arlington Heights . I just wanted Mr. Kline to know that the remodeling is finished . It 's all done the way he wanted it . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear that . " " Yes . " Without another word , Conlin hung up . He left the phone booth and stretched in the lazy sunlight . Such a call was like the cherry on top of the service he provided ; it meant a lot to clients to know they 'd gotten what they paid for , without having to wait and scan newspapers . For someone of Conlin 's caliber , payment was all up front . Clients knew he 'd do the job . He had a reputation to uphold , and if he ever failed to deliver - well , Conlin of all people knew that no one could run far enough or fast enough . He was sure that by the time he found one of the motels , it would be late enough in the day to check in . Back inside the Malibu , it felt like midsummer . He could barely grasp the steering wheel , and the smell of new-car upholstery seemed stronger after a baking . Conlin started the engine , opened his window , and cruised slowly until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orange flyers , he followed its north side - Thatcher Street - and worked his way west . He saw a sign for the V.F.W. and glimpsed the building down a street to his left - no problem to find . The inner , residential streets of the town were thick with sights he remembered from his childhood in a similar place . Camper-trailers , doghouses , tire swings on rusty chains with bare patches in the sere lawns beneath them ... and everywhere , decorations . Even here , miles from nowhere , families poured hundreds of dollars into the vast industry that All Hallows Eve had become ; and what they could n't buy , they made . No - he had that backward . The preference here was making , stuffing old clothes , digging out time-yellowed sheets , raiding attic trunks for hats and duster coats - and all these offerings placed on the altar of Hallowe'en . Strings of lights festooned the trees , some already on in the daylight , orange and winking , the wilder cousins of the Christmas lights that would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere near the big deal here that Hallowe'en was . Bats and ghosts bobbed and fluttered , suspended from branches . Plastic gargoyles crouched on the balcony of a three-story mansion . Whole families of ghouls stood propped in yards , scarecrow hillbillies with jugs of moonshine and blood-spattered shirts . Tombstones sprouted like toadstools around porches , and Conlin had an impulse to stop the car and see if he could make out inscriptions on them . Would they have a generic R.I.P. , nothing at all , or maybe funny little poem epitaphs ? But he drove on , following the lowering sun . People were on the move : cars pulled out of some driveways and into others ; adults lingered in open doorways , talking to listeners unseen within . Sometimes eager children tugged at the grownups " hands . Groups clustered on porches , baskets and bundles in their arms . Already they were setting up lawnchairs along Thatcher , four hours early . At dusk , the childhood wonderland would be waking up , coming alive . Suddenly Conlin could n't wait to be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Thatcher dead-ended at Lueders Road , beyond which empty fields rolled away , dotted with dark islands of forest . A soybean processing mill rose purple and faint on the horizon like a medieval castle protecting these lands . Conlin peered both ways and decided to turn left , which was wrong : in that direction , the road only took him past more homes , a trailer court , a picturesque cemetery , and a chained-off driveway leading into a pine grove , beside which a hand-lettered sign declared PLACE OF CROWS . Conlin could n't tell if it was something rigged up for Hallowe'en , or whether it was the crow place year-round . Fitting , since it was right across from the cemetery . He turned around in a warehouse lot and headed back north on Lueders . The Nite-Lite was newer than he 'd expected - all ground-floor , a long , narrow building . The Bone Man was obviously excellent business : the lot looked full , but the neon sign said VACANCY . Actually , Conlin noticed , it said ACANCY- the NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V with it . A modest little motel , just what one would expect for the size of the town - no swimming pool , no boasts of fitness rooms or Internet connections . Two more cars drove in as Conlin approached the office door . Good : the crowd made it all the easier to blend in . Filling out the registration card , he knew he could write anything he wanted for his name , car make , and plate number - and he did . The pot-bellied owner did n't even look askance when Conlin said he 'd be paying with cash . A sign taped to the desk informed him payment was required in advance . Fine with Conlin . Even better , the owner had filled the place up from the front , so Conlin 's room was around back , where his car would n't be visible to anyone but the residents of a nursing home beyond a chain-link fence - not that it mattered . As he cruised the lot , he saw that no more than half the license plates were Illinois . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bizarre . Having eased up to the concrete bumper in front of Room 18 , he locked the car and tested the handle on the driver 's side . This was the only parking space he 'd need until morning . He preferred to walk the ten or twelve blocks to the parade . The motel 's key was modern , a gray card-key . Conlin took a glance at the room to satisfy himself he could sleep there - no tractor-sized holes in the wall or corpses sprawled across the bed . Corpses . He 'd heard an urban legend once that hit men sometimes disposed of a mark by cutting out a human-sized hollow in the box springs under a motel mattress . Stupid , of course - all that lifting , cutting of fabric and metal , and smuggling a body into a motel room - no one reasonable would go to that much trouble to hide something that was about to start stinking to high heaven anyway . Still , Conlin could never lie down before he 'd checked . Three forty-two . Too early to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry . He pulled off his shoes , grabbed the remote , and surfed the TV channels for news . Another big earthquake in Japan , a plane crash outside Madrid , not believed to be terrorist-related . He flipped to a soap where some babe was sneaking through an apartment , rifling the drawers . Conlin would have liked to rifle her drawers . Then a guy came home to the apartment with a blonde hottie glued to him , and the first babe was staying out of sight , all scandalized and freaking out as the two were going at it on the couch , and then she whipped a sub-compact piece out of her purse . You go , baby , Conlin encouraged her - but then the station cut away to a commercial , and Conlin cut away for good . No chance of anyone being definitively shot before the weekend . He thumbed the off switch . The TV was more irritating than relaxing . Instead , he watched the light slanting through the curtains . He reclined against the headboard , hands folded across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blink of his eyelids . Like a reptile , a kid had told him in high school , the way he 'd sit on a corner of the bleachers in the gym during the free period after lunch : Man , you 're like some freakin " snake . Watching , watching the show . In public places , he watched people breathing , watched where they put their keys , what they had in their hands , how they sat . It had n't won him any popularity points in school . Then he 'd made a career of it . The light deepened , lengthened across the cheap carpet , ripened from gold to burnished orange . Conlin sat up on the bed and hugged his knees , expectant as a hungry dog beside his dish . Light crept up the dresser , over the TV , over the painting of a bowl of fruit . Five fifteen . Conlin left the bed , a crocodile slipping into the water . He stepped into his shoes , retied them . Shrugged into his sportcoat , smoothed it over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his keys , including the motel key . He laughed at himself for being so quiet . But he did feel as if he were doing something forbidden , something voyeuristic , as if he were about to stroll invisible through a girls " locker room and take all the time he wanted as an entire volleyball team undressed . It was a good analogy - he felt a mounting heat in his groin . He never felt evil doing a mark , stalking some poor bastard down , clubbing him , taping his mouth and limbs , driving him out to the woods , putting the Clock to his head , seeing the last plea for mercy in the terrified eyes . Never a bit of remorse . Conlin 's " soul , " if that 's what a guy wanted to call it , was like the closed-down packing plant that the kids had been scared of in junior high . Haunted place , all the usual stories , crazy guy living inside , steel hook for a hand , missing pets and homeless people hanging in there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conlin had never been scared of the building , not by then . That was after . After he 'd found out what his hands could do . In the summer following eighth grade , he 'd ripped a piece of plywood off a window and crawled right in there , and he 'd found exactly what he 'd expected . Nothing . Nothing at all . Emptiness . So why this tantalizing feeling now , the sense that there was something here he might actually violate ! A strange idea came as he stepped out and studied the red glare west of town , where the sun was a fat , bulging ball above the horizon , like those occasional eggs cracked open that are full of blood . The Bone Man knows I 'm not afraid of him . He 's afraid of me . He locked the door , circled the motel , crossed Lueders Road , and walked into the dark heart of the town . Black bushes , spreading trees - there seemed more of them at night , with glowing plastic lanterns strung among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jack-o ' - lanterns , white ghosts , green-faced witches . ( Whoever came up with the idea that a witch should have a green face ? ) It was dark ahead of him , though fire still hung in the vanished sun 's wake . Slowly the sky 's lavender changed to deep blue , and stars glittered . All around him , it was as if veils dropped away , and Conlin was walking back into the streets of his childhood . Here , under the breeze-shivery maples and oaks slouching toward cold , it was no longer the age of the Internet and little phones in your pocket that took pictures and movies/ it seemed more the era when cars had lock-levers like golf tees , phones had round dials , and TVs were controlled by big , stubborn knobs on the front . Conlin passed over sidewalks that veered to accommodate trees , some concrete sections pushed up into humps by the roots . Trees owned these prairie towns , he mused : trees " crowns were crossbeams above ; their roots shot far into the earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that held the community to the land . Bicycles leaned against front porches , toys lay scattered in the yards . Wooden rungs nailed straight into bark climbed to ramshackle platforms and clubhouses , their canvas door-flaps bellying like the sails of pirate ships . The light was a warm , gold suffusion , partly from the lanterns , partly from streetlights , partly from the windows of houses . People congregated in driveways , on breezeways , along the curb , chattering , laughing , hands thrust into jacket pockets for warmth . Some nodded at Conlin , some smiled , some took no notice . Old couples sat in lawnchairs , quilts shared between them . Porch swings creaked and rocked . Steam rose from mugs of hot cider , its tart-sweet scent triggering Conlin 's saliva at the back corners of his tongue . Two teenage girls swished by through the drifted leaves , their white teeth biting into caramel apples . Conlin stared unabashedly after them , at the denim riding their curves . Most jack-o ' - lanterns here were true works of art , carved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dancing light inside , eyes following Conlin , cheeks bunching , nostrils dilating at him . A police cruiser glided down the street , silent and slow , lights flashing red-blue-red-blue . Conlin made brazen eye contact with the officer driving , who waved . Howdy . Evening , fella . Then , with a sound like an approaching stampede , costumed children exploded onto the scene . Conlin had wondered if trick-or-treating fit into this town 's Hallowe'en ritual - apparently so . But he 'd never seen trick-or-treating like this . It was not just door-to-door , but through the crowds as well , like a wild charge of highway robbers , like forty thieves , like Vikings pillaging . And the townspeople were ready for it . They forked over candy from shopping bags , from backpacks , from car trunks . Grinning , Conlin held up his palms in a gesture of haven't-got-any , and the tide of witches and aliens and serial killers broke around him . In some of the eyes behind the eyeholes , Conlin thought he saw flickers of uncertainty as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , not the smart ones . They knew whom to be afraid of . They knew when something wicked this way came . Six twenty-four . Conlin looked hard at his watch . Had he really been here that long ? He 'd walked the entire parade route clockwise and wandered through several sidestreets beside , listening to the peals of laughter , the excited calls , the ding-dong of doorbells , the crunch of running feet in dry leaves . He 'd been watching the phosphorescent batons and flashlights in the hands of kids , the distant silhouettes of their antennaed , helmeted , peak-hatted shapes as they huddled under streetlights to compare their loot and plan their next assaults . He 'd found delight in the way their shadows loomed huge on the undersides of leaves as doors opened for them . No parents . That was the fundamental difference here . Conlin had never seen trick-or-treating done without parents a few steps in the background , their eyes alert for the zeal Hallowe'en horrors . Was it okay here because the whole town was outdoors anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ... ? The Bone Man takes care of things . Right . That had to be it , Conlin thought gleefully as he turned the corner of Howlet Street - Howletl - and headed toward the V.F.W. The Bone Man watches over his own . No one wants to step on the Bone Man 's toes , just like Billy had said . People were coming out in ever-greater numbers with their folding chairs , blankets , and thermoses . Some spectators had cameras , getting ready to take more Bone Man pictures that would fill other scrapbooks , archived for visitors to wonder or scoff at , on and on into the future , page after page piling up like the falling leaves of autumn . Belief and unbelief . To some the mystery was hidden . Having eyes they saw not ; having ears they heard not . Conlin saw , and he heard . Whatever this Bone Man was - and he meant to find out , soon now - this night had always belonged to little Jack Conlin , the haunter of the dark . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long away . " The dog returns to its own vomit , " said the Bible . Conlin shivered with a visceral thrill at the frisson of dead leaves . Half a block from the V.F.W. , he was already among the costumed participants of the parade , who milled around adjusting each other 's wings or cloaks or headgear , receiving numbers for the judging , holding muffled conversations through their masks . As in the photos , the costumes were mostly good , some astoundingly so . Modern movie characters mingled with the old traditionals , the creative originals , the truly bizarre . There were vampires with flour-white faces and red lips , a mummy bound head to foot with toilet paper , and probably close to a hundred witches of all sizes . There was a wolf-man who looked more like a dog-man , fur spilling out through the tatters of his clothes . Clowns and fairies sashayed and floated . A woman in a rubber crone mask clung to the arm of an old-fashioned policeman ; Conlin speculated on whether their pairing was supposed to mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a samurai ... an ordinary-looking gentleman who walked deftly on three legs .. . a tall thing with red-flashing eyes and the wings of a gigantic moth . Twice , bobbing through the crowd , he glimpsed a kid made up to look like a hideous dwarf . Or maybe an ugly dwarf only lightly made up . Elaborate floats hulked in the parking lot , their tractors rumbling and puffing smoke . On one flatbed wagon rose a medieval castle , on another , an entire crumbling mansion , thrusting up turrets , bats bouncing on elastic cords , a fiery glow bleeding through its shutters . Another tractor pulled a rolling graveyard in which a mad scientist and a beast-man were packing dry ice behind the headstones . Conlin paced through the lot and no one seemed to care . There were other uncostumed people , too - family and friends of the paraders , assisting them like pit crews . There were officials carrying clipboards , checking their watches , possibly inspecting for safety . No flaming rags allowed , no moving chainsaws . Conlin kept his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed . And there were other tourists , rubbernecking and talking too loudly , as if having driven a long way gave them special rights . " Wheah is he ? " bleated a woman in some variation of New Englandese . " Wheah 's the Bone Man ? " " He likes a dramatic entrance , " called one of the officials brightly , whisking past . " May not be here right at the beginning , but he never misses a Parade ! " Conlin was pretty sure this was the same heavyset , silverhaired businessman he 'd seen coming out of Stacy 's Kitchen . Conlin had reached the lot 's far corner , farthest from the light , from the strobing police car that would lead the parade out under the limbs , under the October stars . Turning , he put his back to a tree trunk . Always on the fringe of the crowd , in the dark comers , that was Conlin . When he was a kid , this night had been less about going up to doorways for candy and more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kids , watching how they stood , how they ran together , stopped , and ran off in a new direction . Conlin was never really one of them , but he never stopped studying them , and he could function in their midst when he needed to . He knew what they 'd do , what they thought . He could always sense the scared ones , the weak ones . The sick ones . " Sick " came in many forms . Once it had appeared in the form of a kid named Brian Delaney . They 'd been in third grade , Conlin and Brian , eight years old . Brian 's mom was never home at night ; Conlin 's parents were too stoned to care what he did - so both Brian and Conlin had the run of the town . They were n't friends . Conlin was following Brian because he could do it without being seen-to watch . To see what another loner did on the night of nights . In a lonely place between the park and the train tracks , Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , his back to the street . Conlin , spying from a patch of brown weeds , could n't see what he was doing , could n't tell what Brian had , as he stood up , in his folded arms . Could n't tell until he saw Brian 's shoulders shaking , heard the yowling , saw the lashing tail . Conlin 's memory held a popping , crunching sound then , but his imagination may have added that . Then Brian had turned around with a vacant smile , and from his scratched-up arms , he dropped a cat onto the sidewalk . It landed with a plop on its side , very twisted . Very dead . Its green eyes were open , staring . Brian saw Conlin then , who had stood up in surprise . Not outrage no , Conlin had n't felt sorry for the cat . But something was dawning on him , an amazement that filled his chest like an inflating balloon , making it hard to breathe . As in a dream , he 'd walked straight over to Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cat had been alive . Now it was n't . Brian had changed it . Conlin had looked down at his own hands as if seeing them for the first time . Then he 'd put them around Brian 's neck in a kind of wild , wondering experiment . Even bulging , Brian 's eyes stayed somehow blank , but he clawed and fought like the cat had done . Someone in another town found Brian inside an empty boxcar , with the dead cat beside him . No one had even asked Conlin any questions there was just a detective who came to the classroom once and said if anyone knew anything to please talk to him or the teacher . But everyone knew Brian had no friends . No one was ever with Brian ... except on the night he died , when they figured he 'd been the victim of some drifter riding the rails . Conlin scratched his chin , watching the parade take shapeHe could still see Brian Delaney clear as yesterday in his head . A shrink would probably say Brian had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abusive adults , it was a creature smaller and weaker than him , over which he could exert control . Conlin knew it was simpler than that . He was pretty sure Brian , like himself , was born without the insulation that , for most people , held in a little warmth . Brian could see the Nothing behind , under , and inside all the lies people told about existence . There was ultimately Nothing . No reason to be happy or to hope or regret or feel guilty . No reason to be afraid . " HE WANTS TO SEE YOU . " Conlin jumped , one hand almost - but not quite - going for the Clock . He habitually kept track of who or what was behind him and how close , but Billy had taken him by surprise . It was Billy , still wearing his red ball cap . He 'd added a quilted vest over his pink-and-white plaid shirt . " What ? " Conlin asked . Billy 's shoulders were rounded , his hands stuck deep into the vest 's pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to see you , " he repeated in a good-natured tone . " The Bone Man . It 's quite an honor . " Conlin tipped his face , searching for humor , for context . He felt his left eyelid twitch . Billy beckoned with his frosty , close-shaved head . " This way . " When Conlin was n't following after a few steps , Billy paused and looked back . Conlin stared , waiting for more of an explanation . Billy spread his arms and raised his eyebrows , as if to say What 's the problem ! Then he pointed at a watch that hung like a loose bracelet on his wrist . " The Parade 's about to start . Do n't worry , " he added , as if concern over the starting time were holding Conlin back . " This wo n't take long . " " The ... the Bone Man talks to people ? " " I did n't say " talk . " Maybe he just wants to have a look at you . " Maybe he does , Conlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rigged up for Conlin after their talk-maybe he figured Conlin would need some extra convincing that a skeleton could walk by itself . All right . It was n't like Conlin felt any threat . One good shove and Billy would go Humpty Dumpty . Conlin would n't follow him into any basements , would n't get into a car with him . But he could play along until his instincts warned him otherwise . " How do you know what he wants ? " he asked , falling into step a pace behind Billy . Billy 's laugh was like one quick squeeze on a dusty accordion . " I 've lived here all my life . " " That 's not an answer . " Billy was as personable as he 'd been at lunchtime . " You 'll get your answers . " The old man led him down Howlet Street to a corner with one called Dee . It was narrower , older , paved with the bricks of a bygone era . Towering evergreens arched over it and formed a nearly unbroken roof , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep South . There were no porch lights shining here , no lanterns strung , no crowds . Only tall , stately houses built well back from the street , peering through the trees with blank glass eyes . " Why 's this one so dark ? " asked Conlin as Billy turned right , heading across the bricks . " Folks that live here are all back there . " Billy hooked a thumb toward the parade . Hands sinking into his pockets again , he tottered straight up the middle of the street . Conlin caught up . " Is this where the Bone Man lives ? " " He always comes out of the dark . This is where we 're supposed to meet him . " After a few more steps , Conlin halted . He was starting not to like this . It occurred to him that the town might be crazy enough to decide which strangers it did n't approve of - just like kids did . There could be a lynch mob back in the trees . He was just going to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Firelight . An old-style lantern . Someone was hanging it on a pole atop a big , dark platform - no , a wagon . A float . Conlin could see the tractor now in silhouette , with a driver sitting in the seat - silent , wearing a hat with a wide brim . Conlin squinted , shading his eyes against the bright point of light . A second lamp ignited with a whoosh . Then a third . Billy had stopped walking , but he kept his back to Conlin - he , too , studying the float . It was parked in the middle of Dee Street , ready to roll toward Howlet , though the tractor engine was not running . Its theme , like some of the yard displays Conlin had seen earlier , seemed to be " Crazy Degenerate Hillbillies . " Five people in repulsive costumes were moving around on the float , lighting lanterns , wrestling wood-slat barrels into place in the corners . Raggy shirts and overalls , unraveling straw hats , unkempt beards , a corncob pipe . Four snaggletoothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one woman , early twenties , with long , unwashed hair , a tattered dress , and haunted eyes . They all looked as if they 'd clawed their way out of their graves . An emaciated man waved at Billy , then took a pull from a jug marked with three X 's . Billy waved back . " The Pollards , " he told Conlin , with a grin that said he was fond of the Pollards . " They always do themselves proud . " As his eyes adjusted to the firelight , Conlin could read two handlettered wooden signs leaning on precarious pickets at the float 's front edge . One said WE THROW CANDY-and the other : THROW US YOUR BADKIDS . Conlin frowned , trying to figure out why the float was so high , with the hillbillies about a half-story above the street . He put it together when he began to hear the snorts and grunts , when he caught a barnyard smell . It was a rolling pen . The float housed live animals . He supposed a curtain or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What - ? " Conlin began , but Billy snatched his arm . Conlin followed his gaze to one side , up a driveway , across a dying lawn . In the deep shadows , something moved . Conlin had to swallow , his throat suddenly tight . Despite the curiosity that had brought him here , the enchantment of the evening was gone . He 'd had his fun . It was pointless to look for the past . You could n't go back - and there was nothing to go back to . He did n't care what the Bone Man was . He wanted to find his motel , sleep , and get on his way back north . He wanted a stiff drink . For the first time in his life , Conlin could hardly wait for the sun to come up . You could n't go back , but you could n't jump forward , either . There was only now . The trees swayed in a chilly breeze . Billy was no longer looking into the yard on the left ; now his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind bushes there , and the wind swirled fallen leaves up in a cone . Conlin watched in all directions , his right hand flexing . He backed up a step , though the move made no sense . He had no idea from where the Bone Man would come . The fat , hairless hillbilly , his skin white and shiny as a toadstool , lifted a fiddle . Bracing it in the folds of his chin , he began to play a fast , screechy , seesaw melody . The stringy-haired girl , who had been standing motionless as a fencepost , clapped her hands and bounced in place . A horrible , prolonged sound burst from her mouth that was either a laugh or else she was singing along . This could n't be an act , Conlin thought . The Pollards were seriously abnormal . Two of the other men linked elbows and spun in a hopping dance . The guy on the tractor tapped his boot on the back fender and lit up his own corncob pipe . Conlin turned three-hundred-sixty degrees , searching . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . He could n't hear the sounds in the night . Flesh was creeping on his back ; cold pinpoints of dread sank into his scalp . He wiped a hand across his face and felt clammy sweat . Get out of here , his judgment said . Get back to the car , get in , and drive . No . He took a deep breath . No fear . Start feeling things now , and he was finished - finished in the job , finished in life . There was nothing to be afraid of , anyway . What danger could there - ? To the east , out beyond the lanterns " glow , where only faint starlight shone , something flashed white . White against deep black . A jerky , upand-down movement , like an old film catching on the sprockets . Conlin was thinking of " Death Tag , " a nastily imaginative version of the game played by first-grade boys . If he touches you , you 're dead ! In first grade , you knew it could n't be true , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounded behind you and you could n't get away , when the fingers stretched toward you and you thought no-no-no White-on-black , a glimmer , a whisper of a displaced branch . A shape . It was as if a powerful vacuum hose were clamped on Conlin 's mouth , sucking out his air . From pictures , from postcards , from childhood nightmares , he knew what he was seeing . The Bone Man . Coming toward him at a dead run . Dead run . Part of Conlin 's mind wanted to shriek with hysterical laughter . " Ohh , " said Billy , " there he is . " " Yeeaahhh ! " cried one of the hillbillies . Conlin forced himself to breathe . All his life , he 'd watched . He 'd learned not to embellish , not to assume . React to what was there . He could n't explain what he was seeing now , but he was convinced . There were no mirrors , no wires , and the thing could n't be a man in costume . It was a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye sockets fixed on him . Spreading its gangly arms now , as if in greeting , as if to embrace him . John is a skeleton , John is dead .... Lips pressed together , Conlin shook his head , pushing away thoughts . No fear . No hesitation . This was how he 'd gotten to be the best in the business . He unholstered the Clock . " What are you doing ? " Billy demanded , grabbing his wrist , outraged as if Conlin had pulled a gun on the President . Conlin jabbed with his elbow and levered his fist up , catching Billy one-two in the sternum and the chin . As Conlin had expected , the rickety old man went down flat on the bricks . Conlin sent one meaningful glance at the hillbillies , making sure they saw the gun . They shut up at last , the fiddler lowering his bow , the corpse-girl slack-jawed and staring . In the sudden silence , the Bone Man 's feet made a crunch , crunch , crunch . Conlin went into work mode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a practiced shot , though he rarely had to do it this way . His marks were usually on their knees , hands taped . And they were full of vital organs that a nine-millimeter Luger slug could pierce and rupture . This would take a steady hand . Let the target get close . Conlin set his feet , relaxed his knees , and sighted . As the Bone Man cleared the bushes in a flying leap , Conlin squeezed off the first shot . WHAM ! - deafening in the silence after the music . Tick ! Only a piece of a rib flew away , not even breaking the skeleton 's stride . Twenty feet . Conlin had the gun at the full extension of his arms before him , left hand bracing his right . Nice , level shot . On the pavement , Billy groaned . WHAM ! Nothing this time . The shot had missed the pipe-thin neck by a hair . Fifteen feet . Conlin closed one eye . WHAM ! Again , nothing , and the shot ricocheted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living man down . Conlin was good , but there was n't enough to hit . Making a decision , he toggled the slide-mounted selector from singleshot to three-shot burst . Ten feet . Three rapid blasts . Better . The Bone Man 's left leg dropped to the street , severed below the hip . The phantom twirled fully around and was hopping now on the nightmare pogo stick of his right leg . " Come on , " Conlin purred , adjusting his aim a few inches , holding the Clock steady . The Bone Man came on . WHAMWHAMWHAM ! Yes ! The spine splintered and the Bone Man fell in upper and lower halves , chopped through at the waist . The kicking leg drove the pelvis around in a scrabbling doughnut . Just in time , too . Conlin had used nine of his ten rounds . He could put the last one through the skull , just like a normal job , and crush whatever was left to powder under his shoe . Blue smoke hung in the air and the Glock 's hot smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elbow , his face a rictus of pain . Time to finish this and disappear . The noise would bring every cop in town . They were only a block away . He moved forward , standing over his jiggling target . It was ironic - almost sad , if Conlin had allowed for sadness . Nightmares and childhood phantoms , it seemed , could be real-quite a discovery . But you could take them apart with bullets . So much for poetry and mystery . Conlin was right , after all - there was nothing to fear , no justice , no good or evil , no meaning to any of it . The jaw , held to the skull by ropy gray tendons , clacked and clacked , open and shut . Casping ? Talking ? Biting ? Laughing ? What have you got to laugh about , you - ? But the Bone Man had one more surprise in his performance . His dance was not quite finished . Floundering forward , rolling on his ribcage , the truncated specter spread both hands on the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sprang upward . The gun still down at his side , Conlin felt the fleshless arms encircle him . The dry , dead half-man clung to him like an obscene parasite , the eternal grin nearly touching his face , the black eye-pits inches from his own eyes . Conlin stumbled with a hoarse shriek , struggling to throw the demon off , to free his arms . Dust seared his nostrils , and something worse - the malodorous residue of what had once been living tissue , now black , hardened , gummy , and mostly eaten away by the worms of time . " Get away ! " Conlin rasped , lurching in a circle , swinging his unwelcome partner in an ungainly dance . Behind him , the fiddle began again to play . That long-ago book , that picture - what did the skeleton want beside the boy 's bed ? What did it want ? The eyes were caves leading to fathomless blackness that could not possibly be contained inside one desiccated skull . On his knees now , Conlin stopped fighting , transfixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in the darkness . Something huge and moving . Something looking back at him . Something . Unable to blink , Conlin screamed . He screamed in a long , mindless wail , full of the terror he 'd never let himself feel . The Bone Man 's jaw fell open in what looked like an expression of recognition and delight . Conlin was sure that a hissing sound came forth , though there were no lungs to drive it . " Hhaaaaaaaaa .... " whispered the Bone Man . Through the jaws rushed a foul , icy vapor , white-blue in the firelight . Its touch was blistering on Conlin 's skin , and before he could turn away , it flowed into his nose and mouth , clawing its loathsome way down his throat . With an extremity of horror , Conlin ripped free his arm and jammed the Clock 's muzzle against the Bone Man 's skull . WHAMMM ! The noise seemed to reverberate through the evergreens . Conlin sagged backward , watching the bone fragments blossom upward , outward , spinning , raining on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the embrace , shoving away with his feet what was left of the upper skeleton . The torso cracked and came to rest . One of the legs kicked a little , then went still . Conlin 's own legs moved before the rest of him , scooting him three steps away before he rolled over and got to his knees , then his feet . He caught his balance , poised to run , but spun back at the realization of what he 'd seen lurking a step away , a black shadow between him and the wagon 's lamps . One of the Pollards . The tractor driver , with the floppy hat and the pipe clenched in his teeth . In his back-drawn right hand , Conlin saw the glint of a monkey wrench - a half-second before it smashed against his ear . HIS AWARENESS of what happened next came in flashes through a red haze , punctuated by intervals of darkness - discrete images , almost like photos from The Book of the Bone Man . Something was wrong with his hearing . Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoked . First , someone was dragging him by the arms , facedown , the blood from his aching head dripping on the brick street . Then he was being hoisted , hands tugging him upward . Then , when the darkness opened again , he was close up under the evergreen branches , and the Pollard girl was mopping his face with a cloth , singing to him in a tender , childlike voice . An engine roared into life nearby . The hard boards beneath him shook , and next the overhead limbs were moving , sliding past . The raucous fiddle sawed on and on . Rolling his head to the side , he saw Dee Street below . He was on the high float , which had begun to cruise . No , wait , he wanted to say , but no words came out . Down on the pavement , old Billy limped toward the curb , rubbing his hip as if it pained him . Halting , he looked up at Conlin with a lopsided grin that was half reproachful , half wondering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved . Conlin felt around for the Clock . But two of the male Pollards leaned over him , grasping his arms and ankles . The one at his feet was chewing tobacco . The one above his head smiled kindly , showing an incomplete collection of yellow teeth . " You " bout ready ? " he asked , patting Conlin 's neck . Ready ? For what ? The colorless girl bent close , her filthy hair trailing over his face , and kissed him on the lips . Her taste , her scent prickled in his throat like the musk of a dead skunk . But Conlin felt his mouth stretching to smile back at her . " All right , then , " said the man above him when she 'd pulled back . " Here y'go . " The two men flipped Conlin , but not toward the street . He saw in a blur that the float 's top was a criss-cross of wide planks with gaps between . He slipped neatly through and plummeted into the wagon 's dark interior . His cry became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , quivering surface - an animal body . With a screech , the beast squirmed out from beneath him , and Conlin flopped into a slime like mud , with more hard boards beneath . Like mud , but not mud . The smell .... Huge shapes pressed around him , rubbing each other in the dark , and there was the huff , huff of nonhuman breath . Perhaps it was the stench that made him think toilet plungers were probing him , squashing themselves against his chest , his legs . No , not Snouts . Round snouts like the ends of logs . Sharp , cloven hooves squishing beside him , one grazing and cutting into his arm . Smart , small eyes in big , jowly faces - eyes in the filtered lantern fire that gleamed red . Above the squeals and the grunts , the puff of respiration and the hairy friction of fat body against body , one of the hillbillies put his mouth down into a gap and shouted : " Sooooooouuueeeeeeeeee ! " Conlin had used a vise once , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshop , when Conlin had needed to know something . He was remembering that vise now , thinking what it must have felt like ; though there had only been one vise then , applied to one part of the victim 's body , and it had tightened very slowly . Some kind of liquid sloshed over him , smoking and hissing fiercely , but the pain was all gone . That was good . That was good . He tried to close his eyes in relief , but they would n't close . He was up on the clean boards again , atop the high float of the Pollards , and the sweet girl was dousing him with some chemical solution that fizzed and sputtered and cleansed . No pain . No pain at all . He opened his mouth and shook with silent laughter . The Pollards joined him , whooping it up , and the toad-fat fiddler ended his tune with three dramatic squawks . The girl sat back on her heels and carefully set down her steaming bucket . Flipping hair from her watery green eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's it , " she told him . She could speak . " Y'r all ready ! " He wondered what her name was . But then , he could n't remember his own-if he 'd ever had one . Had he been somewhere before ? Was he going somewhere ? No . All that mattered was the night of nights , and the Parade . Sitting up , he heard a collective inrush of breath in a thousand throats . Then fingers pointed , all at him . Jaws dropped ; murmurs swirled like autumn leaves riding a gale . Cameras clicked and flashed . A different emotion lit the face of each spectator along the curb . Belief . Unbelief . Scorn . Fear . Wonder . He raised a hand to wave at them , its every tiny bone glistening and white . The crowds were waiting . There was only now . The night belonged to him ; it always had . He sprang up with mounting glee , turned a somersault in the air , and landed nimbly on the street . Then he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
