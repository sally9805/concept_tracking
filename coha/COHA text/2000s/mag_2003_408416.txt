How to break the cycle of never-ending colds and flu , and keep everyone in your family healthier this winter // " It 's all a blur to me now . " That 's how Anne-Marie Welsh , a mom of three , recalls last Thanksgiving at her house in Erie , Pennsylvania . Her husband was lying sick on the sofa , one child sick on the love seat , and the other sick in a sleeping bag on the family room floor . " If the drugstore had a prize for the most prescriptions ordered in a single day , I 'd have won it . People in line behind me had to wait while I picked up eight different medications for everything from strep throat to ear infections to bronchitis . " Welcome to cold-and-flu season , family style . If it 's not a single bug that takes out family member after family member , it 's a single kid who catches germ after germ . You know the deal : Your child is barely recovering from a cold when he gets a stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with strep throat ; just off the antistrep antibiotics when he gets another cold , which turns into an ear infection , which lasts until a new bout of sneezing announces yet another cold . Toddlers and preschoolers catch six to ten colds and between one and four stomach viruses every year-and those with siblings or in group care are even more prone to picking up viruses , says Tim Peters , M.D. , a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical School , in Nashville . Factor in bacterial illnesses , like many ear infections , and you could be looking at months of sickness at a time . Your kids will share their germs freely with you too , of course ! Studies confirm what every mom knows : Once you have a kid , you 're always catching something . The fact is , there 's more to catch , fust when you 've recovered from the cold your child brought from daycare , she 's home with another . And while some viruses are contagious for only a day or two , others can be infectious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any symptoms of illness . Fortunately , your family can break the cycle of colds and flu . With these simple measures , you and your kids can avoid sharing every bug that comes around : Get a flu shot-for everyone . It 's the single most effective measure to keep kids and parents healthy . October is the best time if they 're available , but a shot by the end of November will still protect throughout the flu season . The American Academy of Pediatrics advises it for all children older than 6 months , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends it for all adults except pregnant women in the first trimester . Wash your hands . Because many viruses are spread by hand-to-mouth contact , frequent handwashing is key . As soon as a baby can reach out for objects , wash her hands often . Make sure older kids wash before every meal . No need for special antibacterial agents-lathering up with ordinary soap and warm water for at least ten seconds on both sides of the hand and between fingers will do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song while he scrubs , " says Vicki Penner of Lawrence , Kansas . " By the time we get to " Z , " it 's time to rinse . He 's three and thinks it 's really fun . " She does turn the water off for soaping , though , and on again for rinsing . " If I leave it on , he 'll just play in the water . " If someone in the house is already sick , make sure he washes his hands even more often than before meals . " I tell my four kids , " If you sneeze on your hands , be sure to wash them before you open the refrigerator or touch the remote control so we do n't all get sick , ' ' " says Mike Toomey of Spencer , Massachusetts . When soap is n't handy , make do with wipes or gel cleansers , which are effective against both bacteria and viruses . ( The rubbing action alone will kill many germs . ) Anne-Marie Welsh keeps a bottle of hand sanitizer in her purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie theater- " anywhere little hands are touching lots of surfaces . " Such outings also tend to involve snacks , she says , " so the germs can go right from their hands to their mouth . " Keep baby hands tucked away . An infant 's hands are almost irresistible to people-kiss , kiss-so tuck them under a blanket when venturing out . At home , ask adults to wash up before holding a new baby , and teach children not to touch her face , hands , pacifier , or bottle . Couch such requests in a positive way : When Max Breeden of Birmingham , Alabama , became a big brother last fall , his parents taught him that the place where baby George liked to be kissed the best was on his feet . Teach your child to dodge germs . If you were a cold virus , you 'd find that an easy way to get a free ride is for a sick child to cough or sneeze into her hands , then touch someone else , who then touches his own eyes or nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiser Permanente and an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at UCLA . So rather than teach a child to cover his mouth with his hands when he coughs , have him hold an arm up over his mouth and cough into the crook of his elbow or the back of his wrist . And if your healthy child has an itchy eye or nose , show her how to scratch with her knuckles , which may be less likely to carry germs than fingertips . And practice these tactics yourself , too . Separate personal items . Cups , toothbrushes , and towels can harbor germs . Replace a child 's toothbrush after he 's had a cold or the flu , and especially after strep throat . Do n't share cups , and wash them regularly in very hot water-or use disposable ones . When you wash your hands , soap and water remove only some germs ; the rest are rubbed off when you dry them on a towel , says Dr. Stone . Now , is that a nice thing to share ? At our house , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each of our three kids-and launder them often in hot water . Reconsider indoor play spaces . Some indoor playgrounds are carefully maintained ( toys are washed frequently with soapy water ) ; others are n't . It 's tough to tell . If the call of the indoor jungle gym beckons , follow these rules : 1 ) Eat first , play later . 2 ) Wash hands before and after play . 3 ) If a clearly sick child arrives , leave . Of course , no amount of vigilance will prevent you all from ever getting sick . But these measures might make this winter a little healthier . It may be normal for kids to catch six to ten colds a year , but it 's easier if it 's closer to six . Sidebar Why do kids get sick more often than adults ? One reason is the way our bodies defend themselves against viruses . You ca n't catch the same one twice because the body builds up an immunity to each and every one it encounters . Little kids simply have n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So each new bug is a brand-new learning experience . Another reason small children get sick so often is that they have no sense of personal space : They get right in each other 's face , and they put their hands and their mouth all over each other 's stuff . It 's just the nature of childhood . ( And really , would we want it any other way ? ) Sidebar Can your home be too clean ? " You ca n't eradicate germs from your environment-it wo n't work , and you 'll drive yourself crazy , " says Vanderbilt University Medical School 's Tim Peters , M.D. The good news is that it 's not a smart idea anyway . Harmless microbes around us may help young immune systems develop better : There 's growing evidence that exposure to everyday dirt and germs in infancy helps the immune system become more mature by giving it something to " practice " on . So constantly wiping all your surfaces with antibacterial soap may be not only unnecessary but also counterproductive . Washing hands with old-fashioned soap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renkl can be found in Tennessee , often wiping the nose of one or more of her three kids . // <p>
