Jeffrey Wright makes quite an entrance in Shaft . He arrives with a phalanx of lackeys and junkyard dogs , an ice pick in his pocket and a trash-talking mouth aimed point-blank at Samuel L. Jackson . It 's the kind of grand , self-important entrance you have n't seen since Liberace stopped making TV specials . And for the rest of the movie , Wright lives up to that moment with his broadly drawn , carefully shaded performance as Peoples Hernandez , a drug kingpin and the first great movie villain of this millennium . <P> " He 's representative of something I want to comment on , " says Wright , 34 , " a self-absorption and a nihilism which I see in our culture now . " While members of the Latino community complained last week about the sometimes comical accent he uses for the Dominican bad guy , Wright insists he " did it that way to point out that Peoples was n't assimilated . " <P> Wright specializes in the more subtle points of raging characters . A native of Washington , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It seemed to make sense that you could marry the two , " he says , and that approach has served him well as a militant gay nurse in Broadway 's Angels in America : Perestroika ( a role for which he won a 1994 Tony ) ; as the drug-addled subject of the 1996 biopic Basquiat ; and as the ex-slave who fights for the Confederacy in last year 's Ride with the Devil . <P> It was his stage work that brought him to the attention of Shaft producer Scott Rudin , who recommended Wright when John Leguizamo dropped out of the role . " We did a read-through , and I said , ' Cook up some more scenes for this guy , ' " says Rudin . " It 's such a witty performance . Peoples is completely despicable but never understands why people are mad at him . He 's like a really intelligent little kid . " <P> Case in point : in one memorable scene , Peoples has a meeting while sitting on the toilet with all the abandon of a two-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not his idea to have a rude noise on the soundtrack while he 's sitting there . " When I saw it , it got a big laugh , " he says , " and that 's not what the scene 's about . " <P> This statement is worrisome . Here , in the age of Adam Sandler , is an actor opposed to bathroom humor . There 's another dilemma . Asked about the lack of choice roles for black actors , Wright pauses . " If there 's a positive for actors of color , it 's that there are so many undiscovered stories from our perspective , " he says . Some of those stories will fill a screenplay he 's writing based on inner-city kids he grew up with ; this could mean that Wright will make some noise of his own . <P>  --  By Jess Cagle .
