I grew up in Scotland , and that was where I first became involved in music . I 'd never been outside the country before I joined a rock band . Scotland has no music industry per se . Everything in terms of the industry goes through London , which causes it to be quite difficult for Scottish musicians to really garner any national attention in the United Kingdom . Certainly when I was 15 , it was only once you made a big splash locally that the record labels ever took note . I think Scottish musicians work in isolation a lot of the time . Consequently , that allows a certain lack of self-consciousness . <P> Edinburgh is a very cultural city ; it 's sort of known as the cultural center of Scotland and also has quite an influence on the U.K. scene because it has an arts festival every summer and a film festival every year . There were a lot of opportunities at that time for us to play live and garner a huge live following . There have always been a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to get together . It 's a real pub culture . Playing in the pubs , not just in clubs , was a very common way of reaching a live audience . You would play for a lot of drunken Scotsmen . They would all sing along  --  that 's just the way the culture is over there . <P> There are a lot of great things coming out of Scotland now , which is very exciting . There 's a Chemikal Underground record label that has great acts . Travis , the Delgados and Idlewild  --  they 're all Scottish bands . It goes in waves . It becomes fashionable for the record companies to come north of the border . And at the moment , I think Scotland 's enjoying a sort of renaissance in that sense . For a long time in London , they believed that the Irish , Welsh and Scots were heathens and had nothing of value to contribute to the music scene , and then of course with the huge success of Scottish artists , Irish artists and Welsh artists over the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they see an opportunity to make money , so of course they spread their probes out now into those regions that they once considered the wilderness . There 's just a lot of creativity and much more diversity now than there was when I was 15 . <P>  --  Reported by Alex Smith
