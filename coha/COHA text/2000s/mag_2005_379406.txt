When he is n't snowboarding or volunteering for Engineers Without Borders , Dave Williams spends his days thinking about something most of us take for granted : ice . As he discovered on a volunteer trip to Haiti in 2002 , ice can be a godsend to a poor village , keeping fish fresh on a journey to market or preserving vaccines . But how do you make it without electricity , without access to coolants like Freon or fuels like propane ? Williams , 26 , knew that forcing compressed air through a hole in the middle of a pipe causes hot and cold air to flow from opposite ends , a phenomenon known as the Ranque-Hilsch vortex-tube effect . No one is quite sure how the separation works , but feed the cold air into a container , he reasoned , and you would have an icemaker and a freezer , which would have zero operating costs and would be environmentally friendly , since it would n't require chemicals and the jet of air could be generated via a compressor powered by wind , water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . Tinkering with heat-transfer equations , Williams tried to determine how much energy it would take to yield a block of ice . " It had been a while since I 'd done real math problems . I had to break out the old textbook , " says Williams , a product-development consultant with his own firm , Dissigno , in San Francisco . After eons of number crunching , he hit on the right formula and built a prototype . It is n't very efficient ; his device uses 35 times as much energy as an electric fridge to make 1 kg of ice . But its simplicity could yield a killer app in Third World villages , where Williams hopes aid groups will distribute his icemaker as an economic-development tool . He aims to field-test it in Haiti later this year .  --  By Daren Fonda . Reported by Matt Smith/New York
