Dad , Todd , Mal , and me are sitting in the positions I 've assigned us , and the Mormon Tabernacle Boring is singing the National Anthem really slowly . After forever , we all put our Orioles caps back on as the Pirates take the field , and it 's showtime . My palms are sweating . Mom comes in . <p> " Uh-oh , " I say , not knowing where she should sit . It 's Game Two , and we do n't want to screw it up now , not after yesterday 's win . The problem with Mom is she 's a girl . She does n't own a Birds ' cap , and she never thinks about baseball . Mal 's a girl , too , but she 's different , most of the time . Mom sits down on the hassock beside Dad 's feet , which I guess is okay . <p> Al Bumbry leads off for our boys , fouls once , twice , watches a ball , and , then , a called strike . Mom stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 've got to put the clothes in the dryer , " she says . " Your clothes . " <p> " Commercial , " I say . " Wait till the commercial . " She sighs and sits back down and up comes Rich Dauer . <p> " All right , Richie boy , " says Dad . " Shake that stick , baby . " <p> He flies to center off the first pitch . " Man , I 've got a bad feeling about this one , " I say . <p> " It 's a little early to be ditching the ship , is n't it ? " says Dad . <p> " I 'm not ditching the ship , " I say . " I 've just got a bad feeling . " " Maybe it 's gas , " says Mal . <p> " Ship ditcher , " says Todd . <p> " They 're gon na win in four , " Dad says . " Five , tops . Mark my words . " <p> " Hubris , " I mumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial . Todd and I run outside to shoot some hoops , come back in as the game resumes . Mom 's gone , and Dad 's showing Mal his Brooks Robinson rookie card . He keeps his baseball cards in plastic sleeves , in notebooks , and he stacks them all up beside him when he watches important games . He says they bring the Orioles luck because they represent his undying loyalty . He 's says undying loyalty is something I 'll never understand . He 's been collecting since he was a kid . His mom threw out all his cards when she moved , about thirty years ago , and he 'll never forgive her for it , even when she 's dead . <p> " Let me see it " I say . <p> " Remember when we used to collect together ? " Dad says . " Before you were out of the hobby . " <p> " I 'm not out of the hobby , " I say . <p> " Yes you are . <p> " No I 'm not . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat . Mal says , " James . " <p> Dad says , " Ava . " They play this game where they make up nicknames for the players that go with their first or last names . <p> Mal says , " Donahue , " and Phil hits a single , a gim me that Singleton should have caught . I do n't say anything , though , cause Dad would call me a ship ditcher again . If the Birds lose this series , at least we 'll know who called it . <p> Willie Stargell 's up . Mal says , " Morning . " Mom comes back and asks if she should make some coffee . She and Dad drink , like , seventy-five cups of it a day . Stargell homers . <p> Everyone groans . " Mom , " I say . " Look what you did . " <p> " I did n't do anything " she says . " I just asked if anyone wanted some coffee . " <p> " I do , " says Dad . <p> " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioning the word ' coffee . " Mom 's still standing in the doorway , stinking up the room with her bad karma . " Stay or go , " I say . She goes . <p> The inning ends . Dad says , " Do n't talk to your mother that way . <p> Todd and I run outside to shoot hoops , run back in at the end of a shaving cream commercial . Mal has taken her hat off . Rick Dempsey is batting . Todd sits down , bounces the basketball on the floor in front of him . I tell him to stop it . He does n't . Dad tells him to stop it . He does . Todd is , by the way , a sort of honorary member of our family , since he lives up the road and his own parents kind of suck . He pitches for our Little League team and bats fifth . I play first and am , I must say , a symphony of grace and skill on the field . I 'm not so quick around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really not my forte . I bat eighth ; a girl who wears glasses bats ninth . <p> Dempsey grounds out . " Mal , " I say . " Your hat . That 's better . " Lee May hits a single up the hole between short and third . " See ? " I say . <p> " Merry merry month of , " she says . <p> " Come what , " Dad says . Mom comes in with coffee , and DeCinces hits into a double play . <p> " Oh ... my ... God , " I say . " Mom , you 've just lost us the World Series . " <p> " Ship ditcher , " say Mal and Dad in unison . <p> Mom , all innocent , hands Dad his coffee and says , " Perhaps they would n't lose if you and Toddy did n't run outside to play basketball at every commercial . " <p> " They 're not gon na lose , " says Dad . <p> " It 's a commercial now , " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Perhaps the players do n't give a shit what you 're doing . " <p> " Perhaps everybody could shut up and watch the game , " says Dad . <p> " Do n't say ' shit , ' honey , " says Mom . <p> Author Affiliation
