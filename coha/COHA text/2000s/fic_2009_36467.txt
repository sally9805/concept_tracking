Kill Me Now <br> When I imagined my funeral , this was n't what I had in mind . First of all , I hoped I would be old , a stately ninetysomething who 'd earned the right to be called elegant ; a woman with an intimate circle of loved ones fanned out in front of her , their tender sorrow connecting them like lace . <br> I definitely hoped to be in a far more beautiful place  --  a stone chapel by the sea , perhaps , with pounding purple-gray waves drowning out mourners ' sobs . For no apparent reason  --  I 'm not even Scottish  --  there would be wailing bagpipes , men in Campbell tartan , and charmingly reserved grandchildren , or even great-grandchildren , coaxed into reciting their own sweet poetry . I do n't know where the children 's red curls come from , since my hair is chemically enhanced blond and straight as a ruler . The bereaved  --  incredibly , those weepy old souls are my own kids  --  dab away tears with linen handkerchiefs , though on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes place shortly before sunset in air fragrant with lilacs . Spring . At least where I grew up , in the Chicago suburbs , that 's what lilacs signify : the end of a long winter , life beginning anew . <br> I did n't expect to be here , in a cavernous , dimly lit Manhattan synagogue . I did n't expect to be surrounded by at least four hundred people , a good three hundred of whom I do n't recall talking to even once . Most of all , I did n't expect to be young . Well , maybe some people do n't think thirty-five is young , but I do . It 's far too young to die , because while my story is n't quite at the beginning , it is n't at the end , either . Except that it is . <br> She 's dead , all those bodies in the pews must be thinking . Depressing . On that last count , they would be wrong . In fact , if the congregation knew my whole story  --  and I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my side , not on his , and especially not on hers  --  it would be clear that I , Molly Divine Marx , have not lost my joie de vivre . On that point , I speak the truth . <br> " She would be here if she could , " he says . " She would be here if she could . " That 's Rabbi Strauss Sherman , pontificating over to my right . I wish he were the twinkly junior rabbi whose adult ed classes I kept telling myself I should take , not that I am  --  was  --  keen on the music of Jews in Uganda . But the speaker is the senior rabbi , the one who says everything twice , like an echo , though it stopped short of being profound the first time . I suppose I should get off on the fact that he 's the big-shot rabbi invited to homes of people who contribute gigabucks and , thus , rate succulent , white-meat honors on holidays . I wonder if Barry , my husband , made sure Rabbi S.S. spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave a sermon I 'd squirm and mutter , " Kill me now . " I 'd hate to think God decided on payback . <br> I realize I am not being kind about either Rabbi S.S. or the heartsick husband . Barry 's sizable schnozz is chapped from crying , and I caught more than a few people noticing as he discreetly swiped his nose on the sleeve of his black suit , soft worsted in a fine cut . Armani ? they 're wondering . Not a chance . It is a close facsimile purchased at an outlet center near Milan , but if they took it for Armani , Barry would be glad . That was the general idea . <br> Perhaps some women in the pews wonder what I 'm dressed in . The casket is closed  --  talk about a bad hair day  --  but I am being buried in a red dress . Okay , it 's more of a burgundy , but one thing that 's putting a smile on my face ( only metaphorically , unfortunately ) is that for all eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way too much , even 40 percent off at Barneys , where I rarely shop because it 's generally a rip-off . I 'm sure if it had been up to my mother-in-law , the enchanting Kitty Katz , today I would have been stuffed into a button-down shirt and pleated pants that made me look like a sumo wrestler , but my sister , Lucy , intervened . Lucy and I have had our moments , but she knew how psyched I was to be wearing the dress to a Valentine 's party this coming Saturday . Go , Luce . <br> Wherever it is I 'm off to , I hope they notice the shoes  --  black satin , terrifyingly high slingbacks , with excellent toe cleavage . I only wore them once , those shoes , and that night Barry and I barely left the dance floor . When we shimmied and whirled , it was almost like sex : we became the couple people thought we were . The Dr. and Mrs. Marx I , at least , wanted us to be . I loved watching Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of his , and how he nestled his hand on the small of my back , then cupped my butt for the whole world to see . It 's a pity we could n't have merengued through life as if it were one endless Fred and Ginger movie . <br> Will there be dancing where I 'm headed ? I digress . I do that . Drove Barry nuts . <br> " Our dear Molly Marx , she would be here if she could , " Rabbi S.S. is saying . That makes three . " The circumstances of her death may be mysterious , but it is not for us to judge . It is not for us to judge . " <br> As soon as someone tells you not to judge , you do . Everyone in this chilly sanctuary is judging  --  both Barry and me . I can hear it all , what 's in people 's heads as well as on their lips . <br> " Foul play . " <br> " Killed herself . " <br> " Jealous boyfriend . " <br> " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have it all wrong . He had a girlfriend . " <br> " If it 's suicide , then why the ginormous funeral ? " <br> I hear a smug tone . " For Jews , with a suicide it 's the burial place that gets questioned , not the funeral . " <br> " He wo n't be single for six months . " <br> " Especially with the little girl . " <br> Yes , there is a child . Annabel Divine Marx , almost four , black velvet dress , patent leather Mary Janes . My Annie-belle is clutching Alfred the bunny , and the look on her face could make Hitler weep . Right now , I will not allow myself the luxury of thinking about my baby , who wonders where her mommy is and when this nasty dream will end . If I could be alive for five more minutes , they would be spent memorizing Annabel 's heartbeat and synchronizing it with my own , tracing the bones in her birdlike shoulders , stroking the creamy softness of her skin . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People can call me anything , but in the mommy department , there was never a moment when I was n't trying to do the right thing . I attempted to live for my child  --  not through her , for her . I tried . I really did . I never would have abandoned Annabel . Nothing ever mattered more to me than my unconditional love for her , a long , unbroken line that continues even now . The best compliment I ever got was from Barry when he said simply , a few weeks after Annabel was born , " Molly , you get motherhood . You really do . " <br> " Our dear Molly , our lovely Molly , " the rabbi is saying . " She was so many things . To our grieving Barry  --  a trustee of this very institution  --  she was a beloved wife of almost seven years , a woman with her whole life ahead of her . To Annabel , she was Mommy , tender , devoted . To her parents , Claire and Daniel Divine , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an adored twin sister , absolutely adored . To her colleagues , she was a . . . " Rabbi S.S. refers to his notes . " A decorating editor at a magazine . " <br> Wrong . I stopped being a decorating editor when Annabel was born . Lately , I was a freelance stylist  --  the person who brings in the tall white orchids and fluffs a room so when it 's photographed for a magazine it shames most of the readers , since there 's no way their homes are ever going to look like that . Then they blink and smugly wonder if people actually live in that picture with not one family snapshot in a teddy bear frame sold at a Hallmark store . Who actually buys white couches and scratchy sisal rugs ? How do you clean them ? They turn the page . <br> I was n't brokering peace in the Middle East , or even teaching nursery school like my twin sister . But I loved my work , and in my sliver of a world , I was a giant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People must have hated inviting me to their homes , for fear that I 'd rearrange their bookshelves and suggest that they sell half of their tchotchkes on eBay . <br> " Molly was a loyal friend , an accomplished biker , a graduate of Northwestern University with a major in art history . " <br> Is the rabbi going to recite my entire rTsumT ? Disclose that I was rejected from Brown and never made it off the Wesleyan wait-list ? Share that I took a junior semester in Florence and skipped every class  --  did I even buy textbooks ?  --  while Emilio fra Diavolo taught me Italian of the nonverbal variety ? Mention the two jobs from which I was fired and the fourteen-month gap between them ? Point out that Barry and I were seeing a marriage counselor ? <br> There 's Dr. Stafford right there . Goodness , she looks quite moved . I always imagined that when Barry and I were carrying on at her sessions she was thinking , How did I get stuck with these two completely shallow , nonintrospective , loser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay . That 's why . But I see tears and I can tell they are real . <br> The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away , and when he takes away big-time , I have discovered he compensates you with a finely tuned bullshit detector . It is a minor consolation , but I think I am going to like it . <br> " And now we will hear from Molly 's husband , " the rabbi says . " Barry . Dr. Barry Marx . " <br> Barry kisses Annabel on the head and untangles his hand from hers . She takes a look at Kitty  --  who forbids the word grandma  --  and considers whether to move closer to her . " Kitty smells funny , " she used to say . " It 's just her cigarettes , honey , " I would respond . " Do n't smoke when you grow up or you 'll smell funny , too . " I hope Annabel remembers that . If she becomes a nose-ringed , tattooed fourteen-year- old hanging out in the East Village with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be a damn thing I can do about it . <br> Kitty is wearing a severe black suit  --  either Gucci or Valentino . She 'd be horrified to know I ca n't tell or appreciate the difference , though I admit it looks stunningly appropriate . The tailoring shows off her yoga-buffed sixty-four-year-old body , which , in clothes , we both privately acknowledge looks a good bit better than mine . Today she seems to have hijacked the first floor of Tiffany 's . With Kitty , more is more . She is wearing diamond studs the size of knuckles , a sapphire-and-emerald brooch dribbling over her breast like Niagara Falls with a bracelet to match , and a black lizard handbag that , no doubt , contains her smokes . <br> I hope Annabel eventually inherits some of Kitty 's baubles . I 'm not saying Kitty 's glad I 'm dead , but at least she has a good excuse now for not willing me any jewelry . <br> When Barry arrives at the front of the synagogue and bounds up the six steps , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tears them in half with a flourish . I knew he would do that ! We saw the same stunt at my aunt Julie 's funeral last year . Does he think my family wo n't notice he stole it ? Ah , but he does n't really care about them , does he ? And what makes it worse is that except for the Divines , everyone in the congregation is buying into his heart-wrenching grief . From every corner , I hear sniffles and snorts and see tiny tributaries of tears . <br> " I fell in love with Molly when I was a senior at college , " he begins . <br> I was a sophomore . He was the pre-med guy who finally had room in his schedule for a class on twentieth-century art and took a seat next to me in a darkened auditorium . Barry wanted to become a collector , he said , and I remember thinking the remark pretentious ; no one I knew aspired to own anything more than an Alex Katz dog litho or a student 's work snagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed on a grand scale . When five years later I found out that he 'd become a plastic surgery resident at Mount Sinai in Manhattan , I was n't surprised . If ever a doctor were born to woo women into rhinoplasty , it was Barry Marx , who managed to incorporate his own nose into his well-delivered pitch . <br> At least forty of his patients must be here today . All those weepers with the delicate , symmetrical noses are n't my mommy-buddies , magazine pals , book club friends , or cycling partners . Do Barry 's patients have a phone tree , like the one at Annabel 's school in case of inclement weather ? Did someone start making calls at 5:30 a.m. ? " Sorry to wake you , but I thought you 'd want to know Barry Marx is single . The funeral 's at ten . Pass it on . " <br> " There are four things you should know about my wife , Molly , " Barry begins . " First , she had the most musical laugh in the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for that laugh . I can not believe I will never hear it again . " <br> So far , okay . To be fair , there was a lot of laughing , and no one thinks Barry married me for my breasts , which most wives of plastic surgeons would have had enlarged from nectarines to melons . <br> Continues ...
