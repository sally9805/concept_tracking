Prologue <br> <br> Chin in hand , Devon Winters crumbled the last of her blueberry muffin with her fingers . Sunshine flooded the area around the sparkling blue pool where Louisa set up breakfast every morning at six- thirty , as long as weather permitted . And somehow , except for a few months of winter , weather almost always permitted . Devon figured her mother controlled Washington , D.C. , weather just as she controlled everything else in her life . The skies dare not rain on Alise Stevens 's parade , or breakfast . <br> The one time Louisa defied her mother 's edict , thinking it might rain , and had set up breakfast in the morning room , was a day Devon preferred not to think about . Having learned a painful lesson years ago , Devon worked hard not to put her mother into that kind of frenzied fury . Unfortunately , Louisa discovered the hard way , too , but at least she had n't suffered the same punishment . Being screamed at was preferable to being locked in a dark closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neanderthal ? By the time you graduate , you 'll be humpbacked . " <br> Without a glance at her mother , Devon automatically sat up straighter . <br> " Henry , do n't forget , dinner tomorrow night at the Tollivers ' . Though I 'd much rather not go . That embarrassing incident with their daughter makes it so awkward . But the Tollivers are one of the oldest families in D.C. society . It could be damaging if we do n't make an appearance . " <br> Henry Stevens bent his morning paper ever so slightly , and his thin face peered over the edge . " The incident you refer to was tragic , not embarrassing . Their daughter died of a drug overdose . " <br> Doing what she 'd done for as long as Devon could remember , Alise ignored her husband 's comment . " Also , the fund- raising event for Senator Mallard is set for a week from Tuesday . I 've told Louisa three times to make sure your new tuxedo is cleaned . I do hope she can remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is . Perhaps we should consider getting new help . " <br> This time the paper came all the way down . Her stepfather rarely lost his temper , but Devon could tell an event was brewing . She held her breath . <br> " Louisa has been with me for years . Do not even think about letting her go . Do you understand ? " <br> Alise waved a thin , elegant hand , not one bit intimidated by her husband 's anger . " Really , Henry . You act as though I meant to kill her . I simply believe that  --  " Henry turned his gaze to Devon . " Sweetheart , if you 're through with breakfast , why do n't you go get ready for school ? " <br> Eager to miss the coming fireworks , Devon jumped to her feet . Unfortunately , Devon 's movements distracted Alise , calling attention to the daughter who never pleased her . Critical eyes skimmed over Devon 's body . " I noticed yesterday that your school uniform is getting too tight . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one this year , do n't you ? " <br> " Yes , Mother . " <br> " Then I suggest you stop stuffing yourself like a pig at every meal , or you 'll soon look like one . Thankfully , your new school does n't require uniforms . They can get so expensive . " The muffin Devon had consumed turned to lead in her stomach . " What do you mean , my new school ? " <br> Her mother raised an eyebrow . " Just that . Next year , you 'll be attending a boarding school in Boston . " The sound of Henry 's newspaper being crumpled barely penetrated her shocked mind . They were sending her away ? <br> Her stepfather 's concerned face appeared in front of her . " We were going to tell you this weekend . " He shot a loathing glance at his wife , then turned back to Devon . " I think you 'll like it there . Meet new friends , see new places . " <br> Devon could only stare up at him as bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her champion against her mother . Why was he going along with this ? " You do n't want me anymore ? " <br> Her mother huffed a loud , exasperated sigh . " Stop the dramatics , Devon . You 'll do what we tell you to do . Now , go get ready for school . If you 're late this morning , I wo n't write an excuse for you . You can just spend time in detention . " <br> Henry pulled Devon to him in a hug , then released her and gave her one of his encouraging smiles . " We 'll talk about it this weekend , sugar . But I promise it 's not because I do n't want you here . I just think you 'd really enjoy it . And they 're very excited you 're coming . I told them how smart you are and how you pick up languages so easily . The headmistress ca n't wait to meet you . She 's going to design a curriculum especially for you , with all of your favorite things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop coddling her . It 's the reason she needs to go away . You treat her like a baby . It 's time she grew up . " <br> Henry twisted his head around and snarled , " For God 's sake , Alise . She 's only thirteen years old . For once , please act like a real mother . " <br> Fear whipped through Devon at the expression on her mother 's face . Despite the hurt at being sent away , she could n't prevent her legs from backing up as she saw her mother rise . <br> " You bastard , I am her mother . I could easily have aborted her or given her up for adoption . Instead , I 've given her a home , and what credit do I get ? None . " Looking as though he wanted to sit down and cry with Devon , Henry straightened . Nudging her gently with his hand , he whispered , " Go on , sweetie . We 'll talk later . " Though tears flooded her eyes at her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She whirled around , took a running step , and slammed into a hard body . Her head jerked up ; all breath left her lungs . <br> " Whoa there , squirt . You okay ? " Jordan Montgomery looked down at her . Though his mouth lifted in a small smile , the sympathy and anger in his beautiful dark brown eyes told her he 'd heard every humiliating word her mother had hurled at her . <br> Mortification and extreme delight created an odd jumble of emotions inside her . She worked hard at showing only the delight . Unfortunately , the tears rolling down her face spoiled her act . <br> Gentle , masculine fingers wiped a tear off her cheek . " You know , in another couple of years , Henry will be beating the boys back with a stick . " <br> Even though a part of her knew he was only teasing , trying to make her feel better , the part that held her heart could n't resist a shiver . Jordan thought she would be beautiful someday . Suddenly her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her mother stood right behind her , her voice lowered to a husky softness . " We did n't know you were coming . " <br> Jordan 's deep voice rumbled over Devon 's head . " I 'm on break from college , and thought I 'd come by and say hello . " <br> " Well , we 're so pleased you did . " <br> Devon frowned at the odd , purring sound in her mother 's voice . Before she could wonder about it , fingers dug into her arm , pulling her away from Jordan . " I 'm not going to tell you again . Get ready for school . Honestly , sometimes you are the most dense child . " <br> Knowing her mother would only further humiliate her , Devon moved away from Jordan . How she wished she could stay home and just stare at him . Being around him always made her happy . <br> With one last glance in his direction , she headed toward the door . Jordan 's deep voice stopped her . " Hey Dev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how about a rematch on that chess game . Say tomorrow afternoon , around two ? " <br> Life turned magnificently brighter . " You bet . " Beaming , Devon ran into the house . She had a date tomorrow with Jordan Montgomery . Nothing could be better than that . As she pulled on her snug uniform , she tried to forget her mother 's cruel words . She 'd known for years that her mother hated her . Nothing she said should be a surprise . Devon also tried to ignore the extreme worry that she would be going away to school next year . Henry would never send her away without a good reason . This school must be one of the best , because despite her mother 's meanness , Henry would make sure she was all right . Her gray eyes stared sightlessly at the mirror as she scooped curly blond locks into a ponytail holder . How lucky she was that Henry had married her mother . Not only was he a wonderful father , he 'd brought Jordan into her life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , and though he lived with his grandmother in Virginia , he often came to visit Henry . Since he 'd started college , she had n't seen him nearly as much . The rarity of his visits made them all the more precious . <br> Tall , dark , and dreamy were the only words to describe Jordan . He was always so nice to her , teasing her , making her laugh unlike anyone else . He played board games with her , told her jokes , and the last time he was here , she 'd actually beat him in chess . She was definitely growing up . His comment today proved that . In a few years , she would be a woman . <br> He did n't know it yet , mostly because it was years too soon . But one day , when she was grown up and beautiful , and their age difference no longer mattered , she intended to marry Jordan Montgomery . <br> He was her dream come true . <br> As Jordan watched the young girl run into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hard to believe a sweet , sensitive girl like Devon belonged to the callous bitch standing in front of him , eating him with her eyes . <br> " I had hoped you 'd come by , Jordan , " Henry said . <br> " Would you care for coffee ? " <br> Jordan watched Henry 's expression and knew the man was well aware of why he 'd come . Sitting down for a coffee chitchat was n't the reason . Especially with Henry 's amoral wife salivating beside him like a hungry piranha . " No thanks . I actually wanted to talk with you about a hunting trip I 'm thinking of going on . " <br> Henry 's eyes flickered with knowledge , while Alise gave a huff of frustration . Jordan never changed his expression , but inside his mind he laughed . Though neither Henry nor Jordan was interested in hunting , they 'd discovered long ago that this was one of the few things Alise would n't want to stay around to hear . Alise was a strict vegetarian and reviled hunting . Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could eat her young actually hated killing . <br> She gave Jordan one last once- over . " You boys and your guns . I 'll leave you two alone . " As she passed him , she paused and ran a teasing finger down his forearm . " Stop in my study before you go . I 'd love to hear how your school year is going . " <br> Forcing his face to remain impassive , Jordan did n't bother to acknowledge the invitation . She knew there was no way in hell he 'd get caught alone with her again . Once had been enough . Though he 'd escaped before she could get her claws into him , he was n't stupid enough to give her another opportunity . He 'd never committed violence against a woman , but Alise Stevens had come very close to receiving a punch in the face that day . <br> Seeing that he was n't going to answer , Alise blew out a soft , feminine sigh as she went into the house . Jordan blew out his own sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his system . <br> " Let 's go to my office . " Henry 's hard voice told Jordan he had n't missed Alise 's less than subtle advances . Knowing that eyes and ears were all over the house , years ago Henry had built a small , soundproof office . Once a day , he meticulously searched for bugs . Some might consider Henry 's paranoia odd . Since Jordan had known from an early age that Henry Stevens 's quiet , cool demeanor hid a powerful , intelligent man , privy to much of the country 's most secretive goings- on , he thought it more than appropriate . <br> The door closed behind them and Henry headed to his desk . For the first time ever , Jordan detected ner vous ness in the man . It confirmed what he 'd greatly suspected . Henry knew about the visit Jordan had received from a mysterious stranger named Mr. Giles . <br> Jordan dropped into a chair across from Henry and stared hard at the man he 'd known and trusted his entire life . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead and explain why I 'm being recruited by a government agency only a handful of people know about ? " <br> A small smile twitched at Henry 's lips . " I knew you 'd suspect me , but actually I fought against the recruitment . " <br> " Why ? " <br> Weary wisdom etched on his face , Henry said , " I 'm your godfather , Jordan . I was at the hospital when you were born . Your parents were my best friends . If I 'd had a more stable life when they were killed , I would have insisted you live with me instead of that cold witch who raised you . I care about you and want you to have a normal life . You accept their terms , normal wo n't be in your vocabulary ever again . " <br> " You 're saying once I 'm in , I ca n't get out ? " <br> " No , I 'm saying once you 've done what they want you to do , you wo n't be able to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change you , harden you . The compassion and humanity I see in you now might cease to exist . " Jordan had already accepted that . If he chose to work for the government in this capacity , he would become a different man . He remembered little about his parents . They 'd died when he was six , but Henry had worked hard to keep them alive for him . Myra and Jeffrey Montgomery had devoted their entire lives to ser vice for their country . They had been true patriots . Could he do anything less ? <br> Jordan could n't deny another reason . The opportunity for adventure was appealing . Hell , he was twenty- one years old . What guy would n't be interested in traveling to exotic places , taking down evil men , and saving lives ? <br> " Are you telling me I should n't do it ? " <br> " Not at all . I just want you to understand the risks . " <br> " If you did n't recommend me , how 'd my name come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't save a school bus load of kids from a deranged gunman and not hit somebody 's radar . " <br> Jordan shrugged , unwilling to discuss the event . He 'd been seventeen years old and scared shitless . Kicking the gun out of the guy 's hand and jumping him had been instinct . His brain had been frozen with pure terror . <br> " That 's it ? " <br> " That and the fact that you can speak seven languages fluently , already have a couple of black belts , and if I 'm not mistaken , did n't you win a science award last year for creating some kind of nontoxic explosive ? " <br> Jordan shifted in his chair , uncomfortable with the amount of information people he did n't know knew about him . Even allowing that most everything one did was up for public scrutiny , the knowledge that people had paid extra attention to him left him unsettled . <br> " What time frame did they give you ? " Henry asked . <br> " Till the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern . " That 's only a few weeks away . " <br> Jordan nodded . " You say you did n't want them to contact me . Does that mean you 're part of this agency ? " <br> " Few people know everyone in the agency . I have knowledge of its existence and a few of the players . That 's it . " <br> Jordan stood . Henry had given him all the information he could . Now Jordan just needed to determine if he wanted to change his entire life . As a goal- oriented individual , he 'd set several milestones for himself and achieved each one . Going undercover for an nbersecretive agency had n't been one of them , but that did n't mean he could n't be flexible . <br> " Before you leave , I just wanted to thank you for your invitation to Devon tomorrow . God knows she does n't get a lot of happy days around here . " <br> " I heard Alise tell her about boarding school . " <br> Henry blew out a long sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for his stepdaughter and disgust for her mother . " I should have seen that coming and told Devon days ago . I just had n't been able to come up with any words . I thought telling that sweet child I 'm sending her away was going to kill me . Now that her mother 's dropped the bomb , I need to figure out a way to pick up the pieces and reassure her it 's not because I do n't want her here . " <br> " I thought most boarding schools had mile- long waiting lists . How 'd you persuade them to take her so quickly ? " <br> " Are you kidding ? With her IQ and gift for languages , I had my pick of schools . Rossfield Academy had the best curriculum for the types of things Devon 's interested in . " His eyes brightened with affection and pride . " She 's an exceptional child . " <br> Jordan 's admiration for Henry had always been great , but when he 'd met Alise a few months after their wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the biggest mistake of his life . At the beginning , it was apparent that Henry was besotted with his beautiful and much younger wife . That had n't lasted long . What had grown and flourished was his love for his stepdaughter . Henry had blindly married Alise for her looks and sexual prowess , but stayed in the marriage for Devon . <br> " I guess it would n't do much good to tell her that going away to school will get her away from her mother . " Henry shook his head . " I doubt that Devon maintains any illusions that Alise cares for her , but I ca n't bear to tell her that 's the reason I want her to leave . If she does n't get out , though , Alise will destroy her . I 've no doubt about that . " <br> " I 'm sorry , Henry . " <br> " It 's not all bad . I married Alise , not seeing what she was , but I ca n't regret the marriage . Even though Alise will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been everything I could have wanted in a daughter . " <br> " When we 're together tomorrow , I 'll see what I can do to ease her fear . " <br> " Thank you , Jordan . " <br> " She 's like a little sister to me . " His mouth lifted in a grin . " I 'm just glad as hell Alise is n't my mother . " <br> Henry 's dry chuckle was filled with understanding . " I do n't blame you . " <br> Leaving Henry in his office , Jordan strode through the foyer , then out the door . He had no intention of getting caught by Alise . Hopefully when he came to see Devon tomorrow , he could escape her attentions . <br> Poor kid had a tough life ahead of her . Learning that she was being sent away to school had crushed her tender feelings . Tomorrow he would concentrate on boosting her ego and getting her excited about her new adventure . As for him , Jordan already knew the answer to his own quest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Making the world safer for kids like Devon was a more than worthy goal . <br> Continues ...
