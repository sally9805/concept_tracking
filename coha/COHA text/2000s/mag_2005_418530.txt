While many in the church bemoan the younger generations , plenty of 20-somethings are working to bring about the kingdom of God . Photograph Students from Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine ( left ) take part in summer service trips between their first and second years . Here med students judy Chen , Heather Hoffman , Nisha Gidwani , Terence Can , Matt Peterson , and Rebecca DeHoek are in San Lucas Tollman , Guatemala . // In Catholic circles , there 's one group that is much maligned and little appreciated . But it 's a group that I have been blessed to work and pray with for many years . They are some of God 's most inspiring friends who get from our church neither a lifetime of employment security nor the status of ordination , but who do n't do this work for money or power anyway . They do it for love . They are Catholics under 30 . Here are some of the things they are doing right . Service 101 Despite the demands of increasing tuitions , rising debt burdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still giving incredible service to the church and the world . I work as a university minister at Loyola University Chicago , where we are graced with a vibrant liturgical life and transfermative social justice programs . Imagine 600 students in a standing-room-only chapel for Sunday Eucharist , beginning student-style at 10 p.m . After Communion , the congregation blesses 90 students who will spend their spring break on alternative break immersion trips . They are sent to build houses in Appalachia ; serve meals in Baltimore ; demonstrate for peace in Washington ; pray with the Lakota people of Rosebud , South Dakota ; and listen to the stories of the unemployed in Camden , New Jersey . These 90 students actually had to be selected for those trips . Nearly twice as many students applied as we were able to send . It is a beautiful sight to see : all of these young men and women clad in their matching bright green T-shirts , standing around the altar , a visible sign of God 's presence and love . Of course , this scene is not unique to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips each year . Notre Dame 's well-known summer project works with 200 community organizations around the country to provide 8- to 10-week service-learning internships to their students . Most Catholic universities and many Newman Centers around the country have similar programs . For many students , these short-term experiences launch an even deeper commitment to gospel love and Christian friendship . Some of these students are so profoundly challenged that they become the teachers and evangelizers of their institutions . A few years ago , for instance , a group of Loyola students began urging the university community to befriend impoverished coffee farmers of Latin America . These students insisted that we First World consumers could and should pay a living wage to the families around the globe who produce the drink we have the luxury to enjoy . Their insistent voice brought a fair-trade coffee contract to Loyola . Now farmers who produce the coffee we drink at Loyola are guaranteed a minimum price of $1.26 per pound of coffee , while the free market bears the starvation wage of 54 cents per pound . A ' ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States from her mission in Bolivia with a fresh vision . Reflecting on her life of prayer , community , and service to the poor of South America , Connelly imagined a new partnership of sisters and young people . The work she was doing , Connelly concluded , did not need to be limited to religious women . It was apostolic-that is , it was about being sent by Jesus to proclaim the reign of God . And all Christians , Connelly realized , were by their Baptism sent into the world by Christ . So when she returned home , she and her congregation began inviting graduates of what was then known as Rosary College in River Forest , Illinois into their homes and ministries . Young women and men were invited to share in the apostolic life : They would teach in innercity schools , staff shelters for the homeless , direct youth programs in poor parishes , or provide nursing care in rural health clinics . They would live communally on small stipends and pray regularly together . Though the Apostolic Volunteers ( now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sisters , this was never meant as a recruiting program for the convent . Rather , it was the beginning of a new future for laypeople in the church . When Connelly founded the Apostolic Volunteers , there were only about 20 other programs like it around . The Jesuits had been recruiting laypeople to help teach in their Alaskan schools for about 20 years . Edwina Gateley was bringing young European laypeople on mission to Africa . Father Ralph Beiting invited friends to share in his outreach ministry to the people of Appalachian Kentucky . But in the past 30 years the vision of Connelly and her colleagues caught on with post-Vatican II Catholics . Now more than 200 Catholic programs are placing laypeople , the overwhelming majority of whom are under 30 , into full-time , faith-based volunteer service around the United States and abroad . These volunteers typically spend one or two years living and working with poor and marginalized communities , learning about the social injustices that create poverty , praying over their joys and hardships , living in voluntary simplicity , and trying to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " new novitiate " because , like the traditional preparation for religious life , lay volunteer programs are an intense form of training for lifelong commitment to the mission of Jesus . They are now a major cultivating ground for professional lay ministers in the church and for workers in faith-based movements for social justice . Consider this : In the year 2000 , 500 new priests were ordained and 700 women entered religious life in the U.S. That same year 3,600 young people completed at least one year of service in a lay volunteer or missioner program . Tens of thousands of graduates of these programs are out in the world now . Tom Gaunt , SJ. concluded from his study of 1,400 former members of the Jesuit Volunteers Corps ( JVC ) that " the one ( or two ) year experience of JVC produces more " influential people " in a person 's life than family , school , workplace , church , or any other relationship . " As any former Jesuit Volunteer will tell you , they 're " ruined for life . " Gaunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . Rooted in Christ 's self-sacrificing love , grown in a community of friends , the experience of lay volunteers bears fruit that lasts . It is perhaps the formative experience of their adult lives . It influences their decisions regarding faith , work , family , money , and politics . These experiences allow a new generation of Catholic leaders to practice living in the reign of God . The effects are great-not only on them , but on the church and the world as well . By way of illustration , the Alliance for Catholic Education , whose members teach in underserved Catholic schools in the South , reports that 75 percent of its graduates remain in education after completing the program . Catholic Network of Volunteer Service member programs send about 200 young adults on to graduate study in ministry or theology every year . These programs capture the spirit of our age . They give young adults the opportunity to deepen their faith , knowledge , and commitment . They nurture them on a path toward ministry , respecting the vocation to which they feel called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in service of the reign of God . Expanding lay ministry Thirty-five thousand lay men and mostly women are currently in professional-level formation for ministry in the United States . More than 10,000 of these are under 40 . An estimated 100,000 lay ministers serve the U.S. church . Uncounted thousands trained for professional ministry in the church but have gone elsewhere because they found no place for themselves within the current structures . Without the financial support of a religious community or its major donors , without the status of social recognition , without the least bit of job security , women and men are responding to the call of Christ for service in the church in growing numbers . Since the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate ( CARA ) first studied lay ministry formation in 1985-86 , " the number of programs preparing laypeople for professional ministry in the church has expanded by more than 50 percent , and the number of participants in these programs has grown more than three-fold . " These faithful and courageous Catholics are laying down their lives . They are giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . Some are creating new ministries imagined freshly for our time . Some are serving in quite traditional roles , positions formerly occupied by the ordained or religious . They are parish administrators and hospital chaplains , liturgical musicians and theology teachers , writers and campus ministers . You know them . They are career-changers like Mike Hayes of New York City who used his professional experience in the secular media to help create www.BustedHalo.com , a dynamic spirituality website for young adults . They are parish staff members like Karon Van Antwerp of Mt . Pleasant , Michigan , a vibrant 30-year-old pastoral associate with a gift for preaching and a wicked sense of humor . And they are artists like Dana Spottswood of Oakland , California , who created a new ministry painting beautiful icons of the saints for neighborhood parishes with her own homemade , earthfriendly paints . Some in our church lament the passing of a day gone by or curse those who do not wish to re-create it . We need to stop pining for the past . We need to meet the resurrected Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . A good place to start is in celebrating those who are already living into our imagined future . We can re-train our eyes to see the places where friendship , service , and life are growing . We can recognize those who have clearly been chosen for ministry in this time . We can acknowledge those whose lives are bearing fruit . These young people are not only the future of the church , but also its vibrant present .
