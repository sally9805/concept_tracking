Like many great medical breakthroughs , Drs . Abhay and Rani Bang 's discovery of how to reduce child deaths in the developing world as much as 75% came from a deceptively simple premise . " We decided to listen to our patients , " says Abhay . That may sound obvious , but in 1986 , when the pair returned to their poor , central Indian hometown of Gadchiroli with master 's degrees in public health from Johns Hopkins University , it was a novel approach . <P> Then , explains Abhay , 55 , priorities for the developing world were decreed in abstract by the medical establishment . " For example , everyone said population control was the No. 1 priority and family planning the No. 1 solution , " he says . That approach ran counter to principles Abhay learned growing up in Mohandas Gandhi 's ashram at nearby Sevagram ( literally , Service Village ) , which favored community and consensus over hierarchy and imposition . <P> He and Rani , 54 , had already decided to follow Gandhian principles and live and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society for Education , Action and Research in Community Health . After setting up a lab in an old warehouse , they began surveying two nearby villages . The results were immediate . " If you actually talked to the mothers , you discovered women had other needs than just contraception , " says Abhay . " We found 92% had gynecological diseases . " <P> In 1989 , the pair published their research in the journal Lancet . " Within a year or two , there was an entirely new approach to women 's health worldwide , " says Abhay . " The global population policy changed from looking at mere reproduction to the whole issue of women 's reproductive health . That was our first experience of how powerful this approach could be . " <P> Encouraged , the Bangs listened some more . They identified alcohol abuse as another big issue and began addiction treatment . And given that half their patients were from the forest-dwelling Gond tribe and wary of city hospitals , the Bangs asked them what a Gond hospital might look like . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical center outside Gadchiroli that resembles a village , with separate huts housing the lab , surgery , pharmacy , wards , library and even a shrine to the Gond goddess Danteshwari . <P> It was soon after moving to Shodhagram that Abhay and Rani were presented with the tragic inspiration for their greatest innovation . " A tribal woman came in with a tiny baby boy , " Abhay says . " We took him , laid him on our bed , and he died , right there and then . " The child 's death haunted the two doctors . They decided to tackle a subject the medical community had long abandoned : the stubbornly high child-mortality rate in the developing world . Abhay and Rani identified 18 causes of newborn death , from the obvious , like malnutrition , to the surprising , like the habit of expectant Gond mothers of starving themselves and their unborn child for an easier birth . The Bangs found no problems that could n't be treated by a health worker with rudimentary skills , some infant sleeping bags and an abacus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
