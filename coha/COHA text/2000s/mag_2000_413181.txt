On December 3 , 1854 , discord between Australian gold prospectors and the government that taxed them came to a bloody head . Within 30 minutes , British troops and police won the battle-but the diggers ' ultimately won the war . // Mark Twain called it Australia 's forest moment . It was , he said , " a strike for liberty , a struggle , for a principle , a stand against injustice and oppression . It was the Barons and John over again ... it was Concord and Lexington .... " On the other hand , my Australian in-laws summed it up as " a stupid overreaction to stupid officials " and " a bloody riot by a bunch of bloody drunks . " Somewhere in between falls the Eureka Stockade affair , a vicious little shootout in 1854 . It killed a few soldiers and police , and more than a score of miners . It disgraced a royal governor . The reality of the incident has nearly vanished and been supplanted by folklore . But it has served to solidify stirrings of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers first spread inland from the miserable convict hovels of Sydney , they had glimpsed occasional glimmers of bright metal , churned up by the sharp little hooves of their sheep . But Australia 's powerful land barons ( locally referred to as squatters ) wanted no part of gold . Their wealth came from the grass , not what lay beneath it , and they dreaded the idea of prospectors swarming over their rich acres . Nevertheless , the 1851 finds in Ballarat , 70 miles west of Melbourne , were considered the richest alluvial gold ever seen . Yellow flakes lay on the surface , and nuggets clung to the roots of bushes . With all their influence , the squatters could no longer stem the invasion of strangers , some on horseback , some in bullock carts , most trundling their gear in wheelbarrows . Prosperous , well-ordered Melbourne reeled as clerks , bank tellers , assistant managers , office boys and day laborers left their jobs and headed west for the gentle hills of Ballarat and beyond . Ships , including some of the new clippers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck in California . New England whalers pulled in to refurbish , and Yankee lads jumped ship and headed for the new El Dorado . Melbourne may have looked empty , but the population of Victoria colony was exploding-from 77,000 to nearly 200,000 in two years . Ungoverned tent cities spread over western hills and challenged colonial administrators . Charles La Trobe , royal governor of Victoria , winced at the arrival of Europeans whose notions of propriety would , he feared , prove as odd as their cuisine . He shuddered at the advent of more Irish . There had been a glut of them among the original convict settlers , joined by thousands more fleeing the potato famine . And now these , all a potential menace to British authority The worst threat , to him , was the Americans . Lurid tales of vigilantes and lynchings accompanied them , and La Trobe feared that Victoria might " parallel California in crime and disorder . " At the very least , the Americans seemed sure to taint the goldfields with dangerous republican notions . The governor reacted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shillings a month , about $100 today La Trobe meant the fee to be outrageous . He hoped it would send the destitute back to their shops and their sheep , discourage foreigners and also justly tax all who profited from gold , which by law belonged to the Crown . Police began riding from claim to claim , demanding to see licenses and dragging off those who could not produce one . Since they could not remember which men they had checked , the troopers kept returning . Hastily recruited , La Trobe 's police were a rough lot , many of them ex-convicts . In contrast , the diggers were simply a cross-section of society , with a normal share of thieves , sots and shirkers , but also including doctors , teachers , journalists , ministers and lawyers .

Right : Having overrun the stockade , British troops attack the gold prospectors ' camp , in Eureka , by George Browning ( George Browning , Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // By May 1854 , when Governor La Trobe left office , Ballarat 's population hung at around 10,000 . Hardships had weeded out the poor and weak . The survivors were a husky , vigorous lot , colorful in moleskin pants , waterproof boots , bright serge shirts or jerseys and broad-brimmed " California hats . " They worked in their " deep leads , " maybe 150 feet underground , then relaxed over a few pots at a licensed tent or an unlicensed " sly-grog shop . " Some of the shacks harbored prostitutes , but wives and children had started to arrive , and a few frame houses were rising among the claims . Many diggers wanted land and a voice in the colonial government . The " Squatocracy " balked at both . Ballarat remained largely a canvas and calico city , sprawling along hillsides pocked with claims . Flags flew above them-British , of course , but also French , the banners of German and Italian states , and the Stars and Stripes . Seeking to end his term in peace , La Trobe had lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in coping with its booming population , had gone deeply into debt . Its new governor , Sir Charles Hotham , had orders to get the colony into the black and boost the flow of gold to help pay for the Crimean War . A darkly handsome , no-nonsense naval officer , just married to the grandniece of Lord Horatio Nelson , Hotham got a roaring welcome in Melbourne when he arrived in June 1854 . With his bride , he visited the Ballarat goldfields to look over what he considered La Trobe 's mess , and the diggers cheered his arrival . One sturdy fellow carried Lady Hotham across a patch of mud . But Sir Charles , sure that a touch of navy discipline would clear the air , quietly planned to collect those license fees , come what may . He eyed the diggings , which had names such as Canadian Gully , Gravel Pits , Prince Regent 's , Rotten Gully , Sailor 's , Scotchman 's , New Chum , Frenchman 's , Terrible and Eureka . He wondered how troops might root out rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he called them . Hotham went straight to work : License hunts would henceforth be held twice a week . That was a terrible blow to men working deep leads . Even though a digger might have paid his dues again and again , he still had to put down his tools and clamber painfully back to daylight to fumble for the dog-eared paper and show it to a blueuniformed , foul-mouthed ruffian who had just happened to ride over from the camp . The camp was the center of authorityand to the diggers , the nucleus of corruption . There , officials planned license hunts , collected payoffs and settled claim-jumping disputes in favor of those who offered a share . Stories of the camp hummed from tent to tent . There was the one about the poor fellow with a cut hand , losing blood something terrible , who went there for treatment . The officers told him they 'd had enough of his whining . They jailed him , and he died . Then there was that chap with a broken leg , out of work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp fined him 5 pounds for not having one . The story of Frank Carey , a New Yorker , made the Americans boil . Carey sold licensed grog , mostly to fellow Yanks . But he balked at the camp 's usual bribe-5 pounds a month whether licensed or not . When he refused to pay it , he was jailed . It was a pair of Scots who brought the discontent to a head . In the small hours of October 7 , 1854 , diggers named James Scobie and a man named Martin , old chums from Scotland , tried to get into Bentley 's Eureka Hotel , known as " the Slaughterhouse , " for one final wee drop . James Bentley , a released convict and a favorite at the camp , had recently built this first hotel on the goldfields , filling a comer lot on Eureka Hill . That night , the place was locked . The besotted Scots banged on the door and apparently kicked in a glass panel . Some said that one of them yelled out that Mrs. Bentley was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep in the barroom , was roused by the noise and saw Bentley go out after the drunks with his angry wife , his clerk , his watchman and another handyman , an ex-con and former constable named Farrell . Scobie and Martin , thinking Bentley had relented and opened the bar , turned happily back toward the hotel . Someone , probably Farrell , swung a spade at them , felling them both . One got up and ran . The other lay still . The waiter heard the Bentleys return , Mcs . Bentley chortling because " that fellow got a clip : " It turned out to be quite a clip . Scobie was dead . An inquest was held , and the police magistrate , Bentley 's silent partner , attributed the death to " persons unknown . " To the diggers , that verdict stank . Robert Rede , Ballarat 's honest but bumbling resident commissioner , sensed the ugly mood and set up another inquiry . The police magistrate adroitly twisted the evidence and again got his friend Bentley off . This time a mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed , near Bentley 's hotel . Police cordoned the area , and troops were on hand , sent out from Melbourne . Hot , frustrated , disgusted and now roused by blazing oratory , the diggers shifted restlessly . Then a well-thrown stone suddenly smashed the hotel 's front door lamp and they exploded into violence . A barrage of stones followed , shattering hotel windows . Doors caved in and hundreds of wild-eyed men stormed inside , smashed crockery , gulped whiskey , finally set the place on fire and cheered as it burned to the ground . // Top : A graduate of Trinity College and the brother of a noted Irish nationalist , Peter I , alor was a key figure in the diggers ' revolt but later served in the Victoria legislature-as a conservative Above : In a lithograph by F.

Right : On November 30 , 1854 , diggers at the newly erected Eureka stockade " swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other . " // Commissioner Rede arrested the ringleaders . With amazing ineptitude , he included two obviously innocent diggers , one of whom had not even been at the meeting , and jailed them , setting exorbitant bail . The diggers met again , wrote a statement of grievances and sent a copy to the governor . He jotted " Put away " on it . A delegation of diggers demanded that he release the two innocent prisoners . Instead , he kicked out the delegation . Up to that time , the American diggers had remained surprisingly quiet . The American consul , James Monroe Tarleton , had been assured by H.A . Nichols , a respected Bostonian merchant in Ballarat , that no Americans had taken part in the " Slaughterhouse " affair . Another Bostonian , John W Emery , was in fact part owner of a bowling alley in Bentley 's and took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American noninvolvement and released grog merchant Frank Carey . Commissioner Rede , however , was still haunted by the " deep game " he felt the Americans were playing , " in a most insidious manner urging on the mob without chewing themselves ... with the view of Americanising this Colony . " Possibly such fears were fed by the familiar wording of the preamble to the diggers ' declaration of grievances : " ... That it is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called upon to obey-that taxation without representation is tyranny . " Despite his suspicions , on November 28 Rede accepted an invitation to an American dinner to mark Thanksgiving . He had barely sat down when a messenger whispered in his ear and he had to excuse himself . Tarleton spoke , urging the American miners to obey the law . But the queen 's toast brought an Englishman 's response : " While I and my fellow colonists claim to be , and are thoroughly loyal to our sovereign lady the Queen , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her oxen , or ( and at that point , he looked straight at Rede 's empty chair ) her asses . " The ass in question had been called away to deal with a real skirmish on the goldfields . Earlier that day , an army baggage and ammunition train , under escort , was attacked by a mob at Warenheip Gully Wagons were overturned , and a drummer boy who was injured in the fracas later died . That evening more than 250 reinforcements of the 12th and 40th regiments began to arrive , along with 30-odd mounted police . Stones , bottles and clods of mud flew from the hooting diggers . Pistol shots rang out . With swords and bayonets , the troops managed to fight their way to the camp , which by then was barricaded . Blood was spilled , and both sides were now blindly committed to action . " Down with the license fee ! Down with despotism ! " exhorted one poster calling for another mass meeting " of all the diggers , storekeepers , and inhabitants of Ballarat generally " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakery Hill . " Bring your Licenses , " noted the flier , " they may be wanted . " As many as 12,000 people braved the heat to attend the meeting , and the grog shops got rich . The chairman kept a gin and soda at his elbow . Two Catholic clerics lent piety to the platform . An editor who had led the appeal to Hotham reported the governor 's stony response . He suggested another try and was howled down . A Welshman and a Scottish minister proposed a formal protest and were jeered . Raffaello Carboni , a red-haired Italian writer who had served with revolutionary leader Guisseppe Garibaldi , pointed to a new flag flying above the meeting . It was designed by a Canadian , Captain Charles Ross-blue with a white cross and five stars , symbolizing the Southern Cross . The diggers cheered . Carboni also introduced a young , trimly bearded Irishman named Peter Lalor-a graduate of Trinity College , son of a member of Parliament and brother of a noted Irish nationalist . // After erecting a makeshift D-shaped fortification from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthworks , the diggers had only two days to drill with their mixed bag of weaponry before the police returned , reinforced by British army soldiers . // The chairman , possibly warmed by his gin and soda , ended the meeting by soliciting pledges from the diggers . He asked if 1,000 men would volunteer to liberate the next unlicensed digger to be dragged off . The crowd responded , " Yes ! " Would 2,000 ? " Yes ! Yes ! " Would 4,000 ? The roar was deafening . The chairman raised his hand toward the new flag . " Are you ready to die ? " he bellowed . The answering yell echoed from the hills and washed over nervous observers at the government camp . So did the smoke of a huge bonfire , fed by a blizzard of licenses . In the wee hours of November 30 , the people at the camp were still conferring . One official thought it " clearly necessary ... to bring the matter to a crisis . " Then they would have an excuse to crush the rebellion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretext was simple-stage a license hunt in the morning . Rede sent police , now joined by troops , through the claims . They were met with a shower of stones and a chorus of hoots . As the troops advanced , shots were fired and a soldier was injured , as was a digger . Eight others were dragged off , and Rede later noted that he had quelled a " strong democratic action by an armed mob . " Diggers , many with guns , quickly gathered at Bakery Hill . The veteran Carboni was recommended as their military commander , but he refused . He was a foreigner , and he regarded this as a British colonial matter . Most men wanted Lalor in command , experience or no . He agreed , formed units and put people to work making pikes for those who had no guns . Carboni translated Lalor 's orders to the Europeans . A German proposed raising a jager battalion . Now a strong group of Americans appeared . One , young James McGill of New York , had seen Army service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , but Peter Lalor made him secondin-command anyway . A carpenter named Nelson commanded the American " First Rifles . " Others included James Hull , the former mate of an American steamship ; a " brave American officer " named Brown , a Mexican War veteran and former gambler ; a Massachusetts man , Alanson Ward ; and a free African American , probably from Baltimore , named John Joseph ( or Josephs ) . Lalor marched his army to the nearby Eureka hillside , which was easier to defend than Bakery Hill , and they began building a rough stockade . By sunset the force , which had dwindled to about 500 men , returned to Bakery Hill and joined Lalor in kneeling around the flagstaff . " We swear by the Southern Cross , " Lalor shouted , raising a hand toward the new flag , " to stand truly by each other , and fight to defend our rights and liberties . " The others roared out their amen . The next day work continued on the Dshaped Eureka stockade . The men used wooden staves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might stop a bullet . As evening fell , Carboni and two others tried a last-ditch parley with Rede at the camp , but Rede would not listen , convinced that the squall over license fees was " a mere cloak to cover a democratic revolution . " The peace envoys returned to their tents early the following morning . Father Patrick Smyth set out alone from the diggers ' camp to seek at least a private understanding with Rede . It was of no use . Rede knew that Hotham was standing firm , that reinforcements , including naval seamen with small cannons , were on the way Smyth returned home and finished the night by writing directly to Hotham , seeking peace . The governor , meanwhile , wrote to London that " the future welfare of this Colony depends on the crushing of this movement . " Few diggers lived within the acre or so enclosed by the Eureka stockade , but many showed up in the morning to drill or to offer help . McGill arrived with his unit , the " Independent California Revolver Rangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Mexican knives . " Lalor was delighted , and the others were impressed by seeing their real weapons instead of the flimsy pikes that a German blacksmith had been hammering out . But the pikes were hooked to cut horses ' bridles , and the blacksmith said they would do to " fix red toads and blue pissants " - i.e. , mounted soldiers and police . The stockade , however , was also infested with spies from the government camp , impossible to spot among so many strangers . The spies managed to convince McGill to lead most of his well-armed Americans off to meet and ambush the reinforcements , marching from Melbourne . Very early on the morning of December 3 , spies informed Rede 's force that McGill and many of his Yanks were gone , leaving only about 120 diggers at the stockade . The men who were left were so tired that they had simply posted a couple of guards and gone to sleep . Now was the time to attack . Army officers were burning to show the governor that they did not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sunday morning , they set out quietly-182 troops and 94 police , both services including many mounted men . Moving stealthily , they gained a position about 300 yards from the curved rear of the stockade . At first light , Captain Henry Christopher Wise of the 40th Regiment motioned to his detachment of 40 handpicked men , and they crept up to the wooden walls . To Wises right , two dozen police fanned out ; to his left a mass of infantry took up position , supported by riflemen on a hillside . Mounted police moved around far to the right , and mounted troops closed the Melbourne Road , the most likely avenue of escape . At 4:45 , a stockade guard saw movement and fired his gun , rousing the pitifully small garrison as well as miners asleep at nearby claims . Instantly , troops and police sprang at the palisade , tearing it apart with their hands and plunging inside . They were met by one good volley from the half clad diggers , and Captain Wise fell , along with a few others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to be sure of their targets . He then climbed to the mound beside a claim and yelled for his pikemen to charge-then shots struck him down , shattering his arm . Friends frantically hid him in a pile of wooden slabs . Captain Ross , the Canadian , ran to the flagstaff where the Southern Cross hung . An officer of the American group , Charles D. Ferguson of Ohio , hobbled to join him in defending the banner . Ross was cut down by a storm of bullets . Ferguson was already carrying one in his leg . Some 20 or 30 other Americans fought stubbornly from holes and mine diggings . Photograph Captain Henry C. Wise of the 40th Regiment falls mortally wounded at left , as his troops storm the stockade . Three British privates and from 20 to 35 diggers were also killed . // Commissioner Robert Rede issued a pronouncement concerning the rebellion " by evil-disposed persons of various nations . " // The fighting was over in minutes , but the killing took longer . Soldiers stormed into the stockade , stabbing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diggers , their swords flashing . Cries for mercy were answered by pistol shots . A constable cut down the Southern Cross flag , and it was trampled beside the body of Captain Ross . Troopers burned the tents , even those in which women and children were huddled . They sabered a casual visitor from another area , cleaving his head , then trampled him with their horses . He lived just long enough to tell how he had been savaged . A news correspondent known for his approval of police action died when a trooper rode up and shot him in the chest . Father Smyth , tending the wounded , was met by a trooper who circled him , aiming a cocked pistol at his breast . He eventually drove the priest out of the area . By the end of the day , three privates were dead and Captain Wise was dying . About a dozen police and redcoats had been wounded . The number of diggers who were killed remains vague-Lalor 's records named 20 or so-but 35 is a close estimate , with 50 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prison . A few shots still cracked in the warm summer evening . As the first reports of the Eureka affair leaked out , all of Victoria shuddered , then blazed with anger . Governor Hotham quickly stated that the cause of the trouble had been those pesky foreigners- " men who are not suffered to remain in their own countries in consequence of the violence of their characters " and who " desire to bring about disorder and confusion ... : ' But the Ballarat paper scoffed at the governor : " Could you not have found some other more truthful excuse for all the illegal and even murderous excesses committed by your soldiery and butchers ? ... Anyone who immigrates into this country ... and contributes towards the development of its resources and its wealth is no longer a foreigner but an Australian ... , " The public saw to it that only 13 of the prisoners were tried for treason . A conviction seemed certain for John Joseph , the black American who had fired his doublebarreled gun amid the volley that felled Wise . The prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not guilty . Cheers resounded in the courtroom . When the next man also won acquittal , the attorney general delayed proceedings to empanel 12 new jurors . Yet when the trials resumed , the verdicts were consistently the same : not guilty . Much of Melbourne celebrated . Governor Hotham , labeled " the vice-regal tyrant , " was hissed in the streets . At the end of 1855 , he died of a chill , still puzzled by the failure of virtue to triumph . Before his death , Hotham followed the advice of a royal commission to improve conditions on the goldfields . Profit from gold , said the commission , should come from an export tax , not a license fee . A digger would henceforth pay a mere pound a year for his " Miner 's Right , " and that would serve as a poll tax , allowing him to vote . Nearby land would be available for him to buy , and he could run for the legislature . Having thus granted everything the diggers had wanted , the commission then noted that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signal that the government is at fault as well the people . " Lalor later resurfaced and easily won election to the Victorian legislature . He served well-as a solid conservative . His friend , Raffaello Carboni , managed to save his own neck in the battle , but recalled being nabbed , stripped , beaten and " thrown naked and senseless into the lock-up . " Acquitted , he returned to Italy and wrote the first book on the Eureka affair . The few Americans who had been in action gave a good account of themselves . Strangely , they got away with it , probably because of political pressure on Hotham . One letter to a Melbourne paper suggested the leniency was due to " flatteries of a few smooth-tongued Yankees . " John Joseph , the first to be acquitted , remained in Ballarat and became a bootmaker . James McGill showed up at the dedication of the Eureka monument a granite shaft that still stands . He died in another gold town , Bendigo , in 1884 . C.D. Ferguson recovered from his leg wound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport business started by an American that became Australia 's version of Wells , Fargo &; Co . It gained fame for its light , rugged coaches , built on the lines of New Hampshire 's Concord Coach . Ferguson finally went home in 1882 . The significance of Eureka grew after it was over . Australians and a few others deemed it the first step in a revolution aimed at independence from Britain " actual rebellion with all its bloodiest consequences , " said one newspaper . Young Karl Marx described the diggers ' rebellious efforts as a " revolutionary movement , " but they were not downtrodden factory hands . They were their own bosses-small businessmen seeking free enterprise . They would 's radicals more than a century later . Still , perhaps the memory of the stockade explains many Australians ' continuing antipathy toward authority . In their proud and widely respected army , soldiers generally avoid saluting unless they meet an officer with a girl on one arm and a case of beer under the other The troops , as many American veterans remember , are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts of comradeship , quiet fortitude , occasional wild celebration , restless wistfulness and deep but unspoken pride . Eureka roused white Australians during what poet Henry Lawson called " the Roaring Days . " Lawson himself observed in his poem " An Old Mate of Your Father , " written in 1890 , " And sometimes they 'd get talking , low and mysterious like , about The Eureka Stockade ' ' ; and if we did n't understand and asked questions , What was the Eureka Stockade ? ' or What did they do it for ? ' father 'd say : Now run away , sonny , and do n't bother . . . ' But how was it they talked low , and their eyes brightened up , and they did n't look at each other , but away over the sunset , and had to get up and walk about , and take a stroll about in the cool of the evening when they talked about Eureka ?

To Hotham 's amazement , all 13 of the diggers were acquitted-by two different juries .
