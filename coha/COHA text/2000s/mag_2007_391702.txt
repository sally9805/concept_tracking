Headnote CULTURE AND COMMERCE Why sending a man to the moon is easier than finding jeans that fit As a teenager , I squeezed into size-12 jeans . Over the past three decades , I 've put on about 20 pounds , mostly below the waist . I now wear a size 6 . People in the garment business call that bit of flattery " vanity sizing . " Sizes are n't what they used to be . But some things have n't changed . No matter how low the digit on the hang tag , trying on clothes is still a frustrating , even traumatic , experience . Though designed as a mere convenience , clothing sizes establish an unintended norm , an ideal from which deviations seem like flaws . There 's nothing like a trip to the dressing room to convince a woman-fat , thin , or in between-that she 's a freak . Her torso is too long for the jacket or too short for the dress . Her arms are too short for the blouse that fits her bust . Her seat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hips nearly split the skirt that fits her waist . The more tailored the garment , the greater the problem . ( Men 's clothes are easier , because they tend to be looser and because , as one industry expert puts it , men " have fewer bumps . " ) Jeans are particularly troublesome . With its body-hugging fit , America 's egalitarian uniform provides little room to hide deviations from the norm . And nobody 's normal . Sizes are standardized . Bodies are n't . Clothing sizes reflect a classic modern dilemma , a conflict between human heterogeneity and mass production . Standardized sizes made inexpensive , off-the-rack garments economically feasible . They gave shoppers a reliable guide to finding clothes in self-service shops . ( Historically , the biggest advocates for standard sizes were mail-order catalogs , whose customers could n't try on the clothes they were buying . ) Standardized sizes seemed efficient and scientific . Clothes could be as predictable as screws or frozen peas-and as regimented and impersonal as an assembly line . From the 1940s through the 1970s , the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 16,500 women , including 6,500 members of the Women 's Army Corps measured during World War II . The guidelines specified the proportions that defined , say , a Misses 12 or a Junior 7 . These standards were always voluntary , however , and over time they broke down . As Americans got fatter , garment makers discovered the marketing wonders of vanity sizing . Equally important , makers of different brands found that different proportions-a larger waist-hip ratio or narrower shoulders-could attract loyal customers who fit that profile . Every deviation from the standard represented a potential market niche . Although individual brands still adhere to in-house size standards , competition killed national standards . The government got out of the size-specifying business in 1983 , and nowadays only sewing patterns adhere to the old sizes . Those sizes were n't all that efficient at fitting the population anyway . In 2002 and 2003 , an industry consortium called TCsup 2 , originally the Textile Clothing Technology Corporation , used computerized 3-D scanners to collect precise measurements from about 6,300 women and 3,600 men . Unlike the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , these subjects represented a broad cross section of the population . The most striking result : Not many American women have the hour-glass figures assumed by most apparel sizes . This is a question of shape , not weight ; a recent study in South Korea , where women are much smaller , found that hourglass proportions are even rarer there . More significantly , TCsup 2 scanner data revealed just how varied body shapes are . The scanners use white-light beams to create a body-shaped " point cloud " of 40,000 data points that captures not only about 200 different body measurements , including six different ways of measuring the waist , but also posture and left-right asymmetries-much richer data than a tape measure can collect . " When you scan someone , you get an image on the screen made of X- , Y- , and Z-coordinate data that is assembled on the screen . You have that person " says Susan Ashdown , a professor in the department of fiber science and apparel design at Cornell University and a leading researcher in the small community of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize yourself from a list of measurements ; you can from a point cloud , because everyone 's body is different . " There 's an incredible amount of variation , much more than we 're aware of , " says Ashdown . " When we see a clothed population , we do n't really see the range of shapes that are underneath that clothing . Thank goodness . " Clothing creates the illusion that bodies fit an aesthetically pleasing norm . And that illusion depends on getting the fit right . Garments that bunch , pull , or sag call attention to figure flaws and often make people look worse than they would without clothes . In a tough apparel market , " better fit " has become the latest competitive weapon . Some garment makers are simply tweaking the proportions of their standard sizes to include more people , by , for example , enlarging waists or not automatically making legs and sleeves longer as torsos get wider . ( The easiest way to fit more customers with the same number of garments is to make waists a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Others have explicitly expanded their fit offerings , selling several different proportions in each size . Lane Bryant recently introduced three categories for each size of jeans : yellow , red , and blue , corresponding to different waist-hip ratios , with descriptions posted prominently in store windows . Many brands mingle sizing and style variations . In the Joe 's Jeans lineup of Chelsea , Cigarette , Honey , Lover , Muse , Provocateur , Rocker , Socialite , Starlet , and Twiggy styles , each features not only specific proportions but also a specific leg shape and rise . By reducing standardization , all these approaches raise manufacturing and inventory-management costs . And , as the dizzying list of Joe 's styles suggests , more variety can confuse shoppers . Instead of the old conflict between mass production and individuality , we now face a new , postmodern problem : a conflict between choice , which accommodates human variation , and information overload . Proportions vary enough by brand and style to promise a good , or at least a better , fit for just about everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , effort , and mental energy . In his 2004 book , The Paradox of Choice , the Swarthmore psychologist Barry Schwartz uses shopping for jeans as his kickoff example of too much choice . When his old jeans wore out , Schwartz went to the Gap to pick up a new pair , only to confront five fit choices in every size : slim , easy , relaxed , baggy , and extra baggy . He agonized over which was right for him : Finally , I chose the easy fit , because a " relaxed fit " implied that I was getting soft in the middle and needed to cover it up . The jeans I chose turned out just fine , but it occurred to me that buying a pair of pants should not be a daylong project ... Before these options were available , a buyer like myself had to settle for an imperfect fit , but at least purchasing jeans was a five-minute affair . Now it was a complex decision in which I was forced to invest time , energy , and no small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone , of course , will recognize the good old days when purchasing jeans was a five-minute affair . ( I certainly do n't . ) For many customers , having explicit labels reduces trial and error . Instead of going from store to store and brand to brand trying on garments in search of one with proportions close to your own , you can narrow the search to those that at least claim to resemble your shape . And , unlike Schwartz , not everyone is satisfied with clothes that bag or pinch . Surely we can do better than forcing everyone back into the old ill-fitting molds . Schwartz 's social criticism suggests an entrepreneurial opportunity . Why not scan shoppers and let them order clothes that fit perfectly ? A London company called Bodymetrics offers just such a service , with scanning " pods " in Selfridges . But Bodymetrics jeans are pricey , 450 , or about $900 , a pair . No matter how high-tech the measurement process , custom clothes are extremely labor-intensive . There 's a reason mass customization has n't swept the jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer components . Changing a hem is relatively easy . Changing proportions , like the distance between the knee and the hip or the exact curve of the butt , is much trickier . Each piece has to be revised , and then the pieces have to go together smoothly . Designing and cutting a new pattern for every customer eliminates many of the economies of industrial production . A more promising approach is to use scanner data to match a customer 's shape with a store 's inventory , a service Bodymetrics also offers . Fit experts envision a future in which you 'd carry your body scan in your cell phone or on a thumb drive , using the data to order clothes online or find them in stores . But who 's going to pay for all those scanners , which cost about $35,000 each , and the staff to run them ? Why would Bodymetrics or Macys give you information you might use to buy jeans at Nordstrom or the Gap ? And who 's going to maintain the databases of garment measurements ? Mall operators might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spreading the cost and benefits over all their tenants . But none has done so . Scanner technology is appealing-it 's really cool to see a 3-D model of yourself-but so far the business problems have limited scanners mostly to research and a small luxury market . " Scanning was interesting 10 years ago , " scoffs Rob Holloway , who bought one of the first TCsup 2 scanners when he was a Levi 's executive . " Now it 's like a dinosaur which is still lumbering around . " Holloway 's latest venture takes a different approach . Founded in 2005 and located in a converted bakery across from the Pixar campus in Emeryville , California , Zafu has hand-measured thousands of women as well as 10,000 individual garments , including 500 different styles of jeans and 150 styles of bras ( another hard-to-fit garment ) . The company had the women try on garments and talk about what they liked in the fit . Combining those comments with information on the fit of the particular styles the women tried on , the company developed a simple list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the waist-that segment customers by shape , allowing the Zafu Web site to suggest specific popular styles and brands likely to fit . For my extreme hourglass figure , Zafu recommended styles that included Joe 's Jeans ' Honey , Baby Phat 's Signature Jean , DKNY 's Stretch So-Low-Lita , and Christopher Blue 's Lloyd 's Sister . Unlike Lane Bryant and other clothing companies , Zafu does n't require customers to figure out for themselves which category they belong in . Its system can segment body shapes into many more categories than a shopper could remember or a single brand or retailer could fill-about 50 rather than the usual three , five , or seven . The more narrowly defined the categories , the more likely the system is to find styles that fit . The perfect system , after all , would give every customer her own unique category , tailored to her individual shape . " You have to be more granular in the way that you think about shape , " says Holloway . By narrowing thousands of jeans styles down to a manageable handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward-looking prescription . It preserves the advantages of choice but eliminates the information overload . What Zafu does n't do is tell you which size to buy . Its system does n't ask for body measurements , which amateurs are notoriously bad at taking . Besides , some elements of fit are too subjective for a computer . Am I a 6 or an 8 ? That depends on how tight I like my clothes . It also depends on how obsequious I expect the vanity sizing to be . The only way to find the right size is to try on the clothes . But at least you know where to start .
