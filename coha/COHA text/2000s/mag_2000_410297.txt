Questionable behavior is Silicon Valley 's next big thing . Photograph // BACK WHEN GREED WAS good , in the 1980s , a lot of rapacious capitalists got together and decided it was okay to do some bad things , like selling junk bonds to each other and doing insider trading and playing racquetball and stuff ( this on top of that whole S &L; debacle ) , which is to say that Wall Street 's Decade of Greed was a carnival of immorality that is a stain on our national conscience or something . Whew , thank goodness that 's over ! Today , by contrast , we have Silicon Valley and the Internet boom-a deeply wholesome movement of idealistic risk takers who are out to change the world and who , incidentally , all look like Jeff Bezos . These good folks and their IPOs have been blessedly free of the sort of shady doings that characterized those ugly predators and their LBOs . And if our TV screens are full of people declaring " I feel the need for greed , " well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not so sure we buy it anymore . For the articles that follow , FORTUNE explored a series of increasingly common business practices in the Internet world that , while not yet the stuff of a Michael Douglas movie , collectively do n't smell right . The first story , Jeremy Kahn 's " Presto Chango ! Sales Are Huge ! " examines the woolly accounting methods by which many dot-coms inflate their revenues . Melanie Warner delves into the world of friends-and-family stock-and reports how one company used it to reward key employees at what was then its only customer . Mark Gimein scrutinizes the decisions of CEOs who unload big chunks of their own stock , and Peter Elkind asks whether dot-coms ' insiderish boards of directors are a corporate governance disaster waiting to happen . Finally , Erick Schonfeld shows how the " objective " opinions of Wall Street 's Internet analysts may not be as objective as you think . Photograph // Together , they present a portrait of an industry awash in ... what ? Greed , certainly But something else too : an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which entrepreneurs have begun to regard the capital market not as a disciplining force but as the customer . Companies are created , hyped , and sold with less concern for attracting real customers than for lining one 's pockets with investors ' money . The result is that participants can wear a set of ethical blinders , behaving in ways that might seem perfectly acceptable within this insular context but that , when viewed with a modicum of objectivity , look borderline at best . One can already imagine the post-mortem articles that will follow any Internet crash . SiliconValley.con , they 'll call it . " The bull market has attracted a huge number of people for whom money is the only motivating factor , " says Roger McNamee of Integral Capital Partners , a Menlo Park , Calif. , investment firm . He 's not alone in voicing such concerns . " We 're getting to the stage where the frauds are going to come in , " warns Bill Joy , Sun Microsystems ' co-founder and chief scientist . " There will be handwringing afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the sums at stake are much , much larger , making the end of the ' ' 80s took like kindergarten . Move over , Bonfire of the Vanities . For the most part , they 're not talking about latter-day Michael Milkens . ( Though the Valley has had its share of out-and-out frauds , as when MiniScribe shipped bricks instead of disk drives . More recently , the Securities and Exchange Commission accused softwaremaker Informix of booking sales that were ... well , not exactly sales . ) Among the common infractions : companies stealing one another 's intellectual property , cheating employees out of promised stock options ( as two former execs have accused iVillage of doing ) , or intercepting private e-mail , as when Interloc , the corporate predecessor of rare-book company Alibris , started collecting messages sent from Amazon , com to its customers . But before we talk further about business ethics , plural , a bit about the business ethic , singular , that has evolved along the fertile crescent between San Francisco and San Jose . The story starts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grant to **27;692;TOOLONG **25;721;TOOLONG , TheseDarnPants.com , what have you  --  market caps large enough to acquire most of the U.N . ' s nonaligned bloc . With every IPO , every newly minted billionaire , the message gets louder : You 're supposed to be getting rich , you chump . The hope of getting wealthy has morphed into something like expectation , often tinged with desperation . " They all think they have a Godgiven right to be a millionaire , " says Lise Buyer , an Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston . " The greed has grown , as it does at the top of any market , " agrees Arthur Rock , widely credited with inventing hightech venture capital . " People want their share , or unfair share . " Most Valleyites protest , predictably , that they 're not in it for the money . And insofar as they have never had much use for mansions and helicopters , the claim is not a wholly disingenuous one . The thing is , money is n't just for buying things ; it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a billionaire , then Ive got to be worth at least $500 million . So the perpetual refrain- " It 's not about the money " - does n't really carry much moral suasion , " We used to be able to say it with a very straight face , " says Randy Komisar , the former head of LucasArts Entertainment and a self-styled " virtual CEO " who has helped run such companies as WebTV and TiVo . " Nowadays , it sounds stupid . " Yet it 's the knowledge of just how quickly it all could end that lends everything a slightly kooky quality-like the manic laugh of the old man at the end of The Treasure of Sierra Madre , when he realizes the Mexicans have let the gold dust blow all over the prairie . " There 's a gnawing anxiety right now in Silicon Valley . Everybody has this nasty knot in their stomach , " says Joe Costello , ex-CEO of software giant Cadence Design Systems and now head of Think3 , a startup that makes 3-D design software . Many companies , Costello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow into " those nosebleed valuations , and that requires the appearance of momentum : a constantly rising line of revenues , eyeballs , buzz , and so forth . " We 've all learned to play the momentum game , " says Costello . " But underneath , everyone knows it 's something of a sham . People know these valuations are absolutely wild excursions to the upside .... There 's going to be a day where people say , " Okay , we want to see profits . " And I do n't want my net worth being judged on that day of reckoning . " That , " he says , " generates a fast-money mentality : Dodge in and out-you know , If I can get out now , I 'll never have to meet that day . It is the carrot and stick of fear and greed . But they 're at such epic proportions that it creates a very , very strange psychology . " Here , for instance , is how Komisar describes entrepreneurs pitching ideas to venture capitalists these days : " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about exit strategy . They 're not talking about the investors-they 're talking about themselves . How will they cash out ? And this raises a subtle point : These founders do n't think of themselves as CEOs of operating companies . They think of themselves as investors . " It 's a complaint voiced more and more often these days , especially among high-tech veterans : Instead of building sustainable companies with long-term economic value , today 's Internet entrepreneurs are more interested in playing the capital markets for the quick buck-pumping a concept , " flipping " it to an acquirer , then hopping to the next hot opportunity like a day trader riding momentum stocks . ( Komisar calls it " momentum employment . " ) Some venture capitalists even have a name for these sorts of companies : burgers  --  built to be flipped . Of course it 's easy to roll one 's eyes at Valleyites , their millions safely socked away , who are suddenly shocked , shocked to learn the arrivistes are motivated by  --  gasp-money ! " I think every generation says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had values , people worked for it , ' ' " notes Guy Kawasaki , a former Apple executive and now CEO of Garage.com . " I bet Digital Equipment founder Ken Olsen said that about Steve Jobs . " But at the risk of sentimentalizing a past that had its share of money lust , it 's hard to brush away the feeling that something has changed . " There was n't this evanescent sense of " We 'll catch the wave today , hit it , and go away , ' " says Fred Hoar , who served as communications director at Fairchild , Apple , and Genentech before becoming chairman of PR firm Miller/Shandwick Technologies . " We never had this expectation of instantaneous riches beyond the dreams of Croesus that permeates , not to say infects , the culture .... There 's been a tectonic shift . " Lest one be tempted to dismiss such remarks as the **37;748;TOOLONG natterings of an older generation , listen to Justin Kitch , the 27-year-old founder and CEO of free Website-building company Homestead . com : " It used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Now they start them to change their pocketbooks . " This situation does not in itself constitute an ethical transgression , of course . But it does create a context in which ethically dubious behavior can seem , well , normal . " Because momentum is everything , you start to do whatever it takes not to break it , " says Connie Bagley , a Stanford Business School lecturer who studies Internet law . " People tell themselves , " I 'm making incredible value for my shareholders , I 'm making great money for my employees . ' And that gets very dangerous . " Many companies , for instance , have become clever about finding ways to recycle their balance sheets through their income statements : recording barter deals as revenue , investing in companies that turn around and buy advertising on their Websites , and so on . " It 's not shipping bricks , " says a venture capitalist , " but it 's the online version of it . " The thing is , because so much in the Internet economy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more customers to buy your product , having more customers causes more people to buy your stock , etc. ) , such tricks have a certain corrosive logic-deceiving people into thinking you 're more successful than you are may , in fact , cause you to be more successful . Lest we come down too hard on the entrepreneurs , though , let 's take a closer look at the venture capitalists ' role in all this . They , like the entrepreneurs , are theoretically in the business of developing and nurturing sustainable companies , and bearing much of the risk along the way . That 's in theory In practice , they 're now taking startups public long before anyone can say whether those companies have a workable approach . By making such an early ( and often insanely lucrative ) exit , the VCs shift most of the risk onto the public market . And that risk is considerable . " The potential losses are gigantic , " notes Costello . " It 's not right . The venture guys should be thinking about building long-term , self-sustaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new . This is a just a pyramid game here , a pump-and-dump Ponzi scheme .... It 's become a completely internal loop , with the public markets paying the bill . " Venture capitalists " main function thus becomes , in a sense , marketing : making their firm 's own brand name so strong that the best deals flow their way and then using that imprimatur to sell as-yet-unproven concepts to the public . " It 's a money-printing machine , " says Costello . " The risk used to be the business model , and whether it could perform . Now the risk is , " Did I get enough of my money in the dealT And the VCs will kill to make that happen . They are clawing each other and stabbing each other in the back and screwing each other . " Sometimes it 's the entrepreneurs who get stabbed . " Last week I saw the most outrageous thing I 've ever seen in my life in this Valley , " says Randy Komisar . " VCs are throwing term sheets on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the deal . The entrepreneurs , of course , do n't know that . " And when the venture capitalists decide they do n't like the deal after all , the entrepreneurs " end up high and dry . " ( One might think , with venture returns being what they are right now-namely , ludicrous-that such cutthroat tactics would abate . But alas , it 's a relative game , and the pressure to produce rates of return in line with other venture firms ' is intense . ) Lest we unfairly single out the venture capitalists , though , consider that everyone else remotely involved with the money machine is also trying to squeeze lucre out of it . Consulting firms like Andersen and McKinsey are taking equity instead of cash for their services . Despite warnings of conflicts of interest , so are law firms . Even executive search firms are forming venture-capital funds to invest in companies in which they place executives . " Everybody in the world is trying to touch a piece of this dot-com bonanza , " says Regis McKenna , Silicon Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was recently about to go public . According to a member of its board , the company 's two largest customers called and said they 'd , uh , like some pre-IPO shares . " I 've never seen anything like it , " says the board member . " it was extortion , a shakedown . They know we 're going public , know they 've got the muscle to screw it up , and so they cleverly exploit their position . What is the startup going to say ? Urn , no ? " According to the board member , one of the corporate customers made $70 million off the deal . " Every single company that 's going public , they knock up for stock , " the board member adds . " And they 're not alone ; everybody 's doing it . People were crawling all over this thing to find ways to get money out of it . " Meanwhile , those who hew to quaint notions of building for the long haul can find themselves walking into a stiff headwind , says Homestead.corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not doing it ? You 're doing this barter deal and not reporting it as revenue ? ' I say no , that I 'm thinking about what this organization is going to look like 20 years from now . Is doing this barter deal going to make the company better ? In fact , it 's going to make it worse , because I 'm going to have to undo it and find another $100,000 of real revenue . " Does he feel pressured toward such tactics frequently ? " Totally , " says Kitch . " Five times a day . " To hear business ethicists tell it , the sheer speed of activity may be partly to blame . " One of the problems is that ethics implies deliberation , " says Dennis Moberg , director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University " It implies periods of contemplation and deliberation , and working through a moral calculus . " Who has time for such navel-gazing when everyone is " moving @ Internet speed " ? " It 's not that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush , a lot of things just do n't get reflected upon , " says Kirk Hanson , a senior lecturer in ethics at Stanford . " You see gold in the vein , and jumping the claim or grabbing the idea you hear from somebody else becomes much more tempting . So there 's a coarsening of standards . " Yet , is it possible that the Internet economy could provide some safeguards against chicanery that the old economy could n't ? For one thing , there 's the presence of experienced venture capitalists and angel investors on boards of directors , whose ongoing good will is needed if one is ever to raise money again . Then , too , the Internet itself can be a force for transparency ; incriminating information that was once limited to file cabinets and a few people 's heads nowadays has a way of appearing online . " There may be some corrective mechanisms emerging , " speculates Joseph Badaracco , a professor of ethics at Harvard Business School . " It does involve a high degree of transparency , but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a different kind of governance system-a self-regulating one . " Could be . The Old West developed a set of frontier ethics independent of the government and all its mechanisms . But frontier ethics can be problematic , " It becomes a wonderful context to validate your behavior , " notes Jeffrey L. Seglin , assistant professor of ethics at Emerson College in Boston and author of The Good , the Bad , and Your Business : Choosing Right When Ethical Dilemmas Pull You Apart . " You can chalk it up to the New Economy . " Many Net companies caught in wrongdoing have simply stopped the practice , shrugged , and said they were n't aware they were doing anything wrong . Indeed , if there 's anything that characterizes periods of economic upheaval-the Internet boom , the Wall Street boom , the industrial boom-it 's the ineffable sense that old rules no longer apply , that the laws governing the universe have been suspended . From there , is it such a leap to conclude that the old rules of ethics have been suspended too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light cigars for guests , they were in a world where the old rules did n't apply , " says Tom Donaldson , a professor of ethics at Wharton . " Eventually , our deeper values catch up to the new worlds we create . In the meantime , there will be a lot of shenanigans . " Bill Joy is right . We have seen this movie before .
