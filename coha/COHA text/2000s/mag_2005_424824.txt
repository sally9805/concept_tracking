From 1 to 6 , how many inches of travel should your next full suspension bike have ? // Buying a mountain bike used to he easy-honest . A mountain hike had fat tires , low gearing and an upright riding position , and mountain hiking was one sport . As the equipment matured , the sport split into a baffling array of niches and subniches . Walk into a shop now , and you 'll find bikes at every increment of travel . Uow can you know what 's right for you ? The following six bikes represent the spectrum of the current full-suspension market . As the prices show , these bikes are nearly all top-of-the-Iine ; you 'll find less expensive options in each category . They 're all cross-country bikes of one form or another ( freeride and downhill are too different to include ) , and each can climb and descend with varying degrees of competency . From 1 to 6 inches , these reviews give you an idea of what it 's like to ride each of the bikes and tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your desires and ride yourself silly . GTI-DRIVE 51.0 Five-inch-travel bikes like the GT i-Drive 5 are in the thick of current suspension evolution . Bikes with less travel are decidedly cross-country oriented ; bikes with more travel are more gravity oriented . Right now , 5 inches is popular because that amount of travel means that the bike 's climbing and descending capabilities are , for the most part , balanced . Much of this is due to advances in weight reduction : 5-inch-travel bikes often weigh less than 30 pounds , and 25 is possible , though rare and expensive . Nearly as important are the advances in suspension technology . These developments tune out the energy-robbing feel of unwanted suspension motion without compromising bump-absorbing performance or rider comfort . Five-inch-travel bikes also get wider tires for more traction , usually 2.2 to 2.4 inches , and often incorporate larger disc rotors for greater stopping power and may have a moderately upright riding position . In other words , the i-Drive 5 allows you to have the benefits of generous travel for fun stuff in a package that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enjoy playfully descending and a bit of jumping , but also want sporty climbing performance , five is your magic number . There are other 5-inch-travel bikes that climb faster on buff terrain , but the traction and control of the i-Drive 5 1.0 pay huge dividends when the ascents get rougher . On descents , the generous travel and relaxed , though not slack , geometry are capable enough to handle most amateur downhill race courses , though the rear of the i-Drive 5 did have a tendency to firm up when our tester lifted off the saddle . We would n't choose a 5-inch-travel bike to make a run at the local race series and we would n't choose it for a week of lift-served freeriding , but , if you enjoy climbing and descending in equal parts , 5-inch-travel bikes like the i-Drive 5 are your magic number . - Matt Phillips PRICE : $2,999 WEIGHT : 30 Ib. , 4 oz .

On the trail , the Scalpel 's true strength is climbing . Without a bottom bracket pivot , there is little flex to the linkage . The 2.7 inches of rear-wheel travel are excellent for keeping the rear wheel firmly on the ground , but our tester ran the FOX R shock below the recommended pressure to get good small-bump compliance . The Scalpel is not a plush descender-the rear suspension is stiffly sprung and the new FOX TerraLogic internals on the Lefty Speed Carbon fork are aimed at the cross-country specialist , despite 4 inches of travel . But on bumpy courses or long days where suspension limits fatigue , the Scalpel seems purpose-built , especially for the rider who , if forced to make a choice , would pick a hardtail over a classic 4-inch-travel trail bike. - Joe Lindsey 3 ' SPEED OVER THE LONG HAUL Cannondale 's Scalpel is light and efficient .

Noodle down a hill or over rough sections and the suspension feels harsh , rigid . Pin it like the devil 's chasing you and those rough sections suddenly get supple . The infamous Northstar stop of the California State Series is a prime example of where the bike shines . The XC course has long , steady singletrack climbs over buried rocks , fast fire roads and a rock-garden descent , the kind of stuff that chews up hardtail riders .

Hardcore ? The YBB is for the most finely sinewed ofthe XC breed , the rider who thinks a two-hour singletrack hammer session is a mellow jaunt and , only now that there 's some gray appearing at his temples , has decided that his hardtail might just be the source of lingering back pain . But give up the pedal-to-the-metal , right-now acceleration he loves ? Never . So for that buyer there 's this lovely Moots with its minutely moving rear elastomer that delivers 1 1/8-inches of rear-wheel travel . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough give to take the edge off bumps while not actually absorbing them like a longer-travel bike would . " We took the YBB on fast burns over some of the finest single-track we know , in New York 's Hudson Valley : Think rocky stream-beds ; churns through muddy fields ; lung-searing , technical , off-camber ups ; assorted log hops and just when you get flying , sudden , sweeping S-turns through hardwood corridors barely wider than your bar . The bike proved its worth on the 10- to 15-minute uphill slogs , where that smidgen of back-tire movement let us comfortably sit and spin-and bought a bit more traction in the muck as well . We could n't stay seated as easily on descents , but if you 're coming off an aluminum hardtail you 'll note that the 3/2.5 titubeset offers a measured degree of lushness to the ride without dialing out the edge of control you need to go all out . And trust us , when you 're riding like there 's a winning lottery ticket back at the trailhead , the YBB steers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving your own limbs . Now the buts : For this much dough , there are a fistful of short-travel full-suspension bikes that are nearly as fast going uphill and much easier on your body going down . And at a few titanium shavings more than 23 pounds , the Moots is n't insanely light for a nearhardtail . Also , the SL is weight-limited to 165-pound riders , further narrowing the customer field . But for an XC diehard who needs just a little more spinal TLC , we ca n't think of a nicer rig. - Michael Frank 1 ' NEAR HARDTAIL QUICKNESS The Moots YBB lets you hammer , and gives you a little back-saving cushion .

The frame was very light ( less than 5.5 pounds for a medium ) and , for that era , travel was huge ( 4 inches ) for an XC bike . Light , 4-inch-travel bikes became de rigeur for balanced climbing and descending . The category exploded , led to more advances in suspension technology , frame and parts design , and bred a new generation of still-longer-travel bikes . All the while , the Superlight remained simple , efficient and light . The single-pivot frame still offers the snappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits from lighter components and the latest suspension technology , making it not just faster , but also ideal for everyday trail riders as well as racers ( Kirk Molday used one to win the 2001 NORBA XC championships ) . Testing this Superlight proved that it has aged beautifully . After an initial glitch with the FOX Float R shock ( it arrived overly plush ) , our tester 's dialed-in suspension soaked up small-to-medium hits smoothly . The Superlight is a fast bike that is happiest on all-day rides , long climbs , semi-technical descents and flowing singletrack . It 's not meantfor steep drops or seriously technical trails . Bottom line : It 's a fast and fun classic with a glowing history. - Jennifer Sherry 4 ' GOLD-STANDARD TRAIL BIKE Santa Cruz Superlight 's 4 inches of travel are as fun as ever .

The S-Works Enduro and others like it pedal with relative efficiency , yet descend with a well-damped , almost downhill-bike feel .

Riders used to lighter bikes with less travel will have to adjust their riding style and expectations a bit on the climbs . It 's like a big rig : It takes a while to build momentum , but once there , it 's easy to maintain a steady clip . Out-of-the-saddle attacks override the shock 's platform , wasting precious energy , so savvy riders stay in the saddle , spinning smooth circles as much as possible .
