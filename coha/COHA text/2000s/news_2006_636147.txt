<p> Ozzie Guillen is n't the only Venezuelan in town who can set tongues wagging with how he conducts himself on and off the field . Carlos Zambrano has irked his fair share of people in his 25 years with a freewheeling personality that sometimes can border on abrasive . <p> But say what you will about the Cubs ' lone-wolf pitcher  --  Zambrano is a no-holds-barred , do-what-it-takes baseball player . <p> As well as he pitched in a 9-2 victory Saturday against the New York Mets , he will be remembered in this game for unexpectedly showcasing his maverick tendencies . He still was working on a no-hitter in the fifth when he turned a two-out infield single with nobody on base into the first stolen base of his major-league career . <p> Zambrano pointed to former Atlanta Braves teammates Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine as his dual motivation . Seeing Maddux , his fellow Cub , steal a base last season and this season had Zambrano searching for a stolen-base chance . And being locked in a scoreless struggle with the Mets ' Glavine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time was right to be bold . <p> The last two years have been embarrassing to have Maddux steal bases , " he said . I knew at some point I had to go . Today was the right time . When you face Glavine , you have to do anything to win the game . " <p> Zambrano did n't score after getting to second in the fifth with his steal . But when the Cubs ' offense erupted for five runs in the sixth and four more in the seventh , he had stolen the winning streak from Glavine ( 11-3 ) . Zambrano ( 9-3 ) has won his last six decisions to match his big-league best . <p> The Cubs do n't lead the majors in much , but they are tops with two steals by pitchers . That 's just as wacky as Zambrano narrowly escaping injury at the All-Star Game on Tuesday when White Sox coach Joey Cora accidentally whacked his right elbow with a fungo while hitting grounders during infield practice . <p> Let 's keep this going and catch whoever is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That appears to be a pipe dream for a club that 's 20 games below .500 . But all season the Cubs have taken advantage when the opposition has made crucial mistakes . <p> The Mets ' Endy Chavez learned that right fielders can be blinded by the light at Wrigley Field . Chavez , who made a stabbing catch on Matt Murton when the sun was in his eyes in the second , lost track of Ryan Theriot 's routine fly to right leading off the sixth . This ball dropped and rolled by him . <p> Theriot 's triple unleashed the Cubs ' mysterious offense , which goes into hiding for days at a time . Glavine soon was swept out of the way , and the Cubs steamrolled the Mets ' bullpen in the sixth and seventh . <p> Henry Blanco had a two-run double in the sixth , and Aramis Ramirez , Murton and Neifi Perez delivered RBI singles in the sixth and seventh . Murton is 11-for-25 in July , raising his average from .264 to .282 . <p> Seeing Zambrano attempt a steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close play that required a hard-charging slide , and not until Zambrano stood up was Baker able to relax . But he could n't be mad about it . <p> This guy is a ballplayer , not just a pitcher , " Baker said . He 's a runner , a hitter , a fielder . He 's seen Maddux do it  --  not a bad guy to emulate . When I saw him get up , I was just hoping he was n't hurt . Guys playing like that , you have no remorse about anything . " <p> Zambrano was more taxed in the sixth , his final inning . While the Mets scored twice to take the lead , he fought to limit the damage , and Chris Woodward 's ground out ended the threat with the bases loaded . <p> Zambrano 's unchecked energy seemed contagious . Outfielder Angel Pagan twisted his ankle while being tagged out running to second in the sixth , but he waved off reporters afterward , trying not to hobble out of the clubhouse . <p> I 'm fine , " Pagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Zambrano could n't have said it any better . <p> mkiley@suntimes.com <p> CUBS RECAP <p> Mets AB R H BI BB SO Avg . <p> Valentin 2b 4 1 2 0 0 2 .288 <p> Lo Duca c 4 0 0 0 0 1 .300 <p> Beltran cf 3 1 0 0 1 0 .276 <p> CDelgado 1b 4 0 1 1 0 0 .248 <p> Wright 3b 3 0 1 0 1 1 .315 <p> CFloyd lf 3 0 0 0 1 0 .251 <p> Chavez rf 3 0 1 1 0 2 .281 <p> Feliciano p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> Owens p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> Maine p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> d-Marrero ph 1 0 0 0 0 0 .221 <p> Woodward ss 3 0 0 0 1 1 .229 <p> TGlavine p 2 0 0 0 0 0 .194 <p> Bradford p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> Nady rf 2 0 0 0 0 1 .259 <p> Totals 32 2 5 2 4 8 <p> Cubs AB R H BI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 0 0 .271 <p> Theriot 2b 4 2 2 0 1 0 .250 <p> DeLee 1b 3 2 1 0 2 1 .283 <p> ARamirez 3b 3 1 2 2 2 0 .261 <p> Nevin rf 2 0 0 0 0 0 .240 <p> a-JJones ph-rf 3 1 0 0 0 1 .302 <p> Murton lf 4 2 2 2 0 0 .282 <p> NPerez ss 4 1 2 2 0 0 .257 <p> HBlanco c 3 0 1 2 1 1 .238 <p> CZambrano p 2 0 1 0 0 1 .175 <p> b-Pagan ph 1 0 1 0 0 0 .267 <p> Eyre p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> c-Mabry ph 0 0 0 1 0 0 .213 <p> Howry p 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.000 <p> Dempster p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> Totals 34 9 13 9 6 4 <p> Mets 000 002 000  --  2 5 1 <p> Cubs 000 005 40x  --  9 13 1 <p> a-grounded into fielder 's choice for Nevin in the 6th. b-singled for Zambrano in the 6th. c-hit a sacrifice fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 9th . <p> E  --  Woodward ( 4 ) , ARamirez ( 5 ) .
