I There is no blemish on the glow which surrounds you like a metal shield . But what good is a shield if the hurt is inside ? ... O Lord , let his heart break and begin to heal rather than this perpetual and terrible swell ! <br>  --  The Scroll of Anatiya 4:42-47 <p> I always wake before sunrise , at least two hours before any of my three housemates . I sit up in bed and stretch , kick off my covers . The polished limestone floor is cold , sending a shiver from my feet all the way up my spine , and it delights me . The light sifting through the window is soft and inviting , as if the house floats inside a lavender cloud . I pull on shorts , a tank top , and slide my white bandana over my hair . I lather my face , arms , legs with sun lotion . The air has the chill of white wine . I 've seen sunlamps for people with seasonal depression , so that in the long , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and feel healed . I 'd rather retire to a room with a gentle moonlamp , whirring metal fan , and dewy humidifier . I pull on my socks , my sneakers . <p> I patter down the hall . The door to our supervisor Norris 's suite is ajar . He always sleeps with it a little open , as if tempting someone to come in . I can see his jeans and belt hanging over the back of his desk chair as I pass by . A picture of Mickey and Orna on their wedding day hangs on their closed door . In the picture Mickey is wearing a light brown suit and lopsided bow tie that look like they and the groom had just arrived in Israel off a boat from Russia , which is n't too far from the truth . He is bending his voluptuous sabra bride , Orna , a little bit backward , her raven black hair wild with curls , and resting his head just above her cleavage . Mickey always said he fell in love with her because she had " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart to match . " A wooden plaque hangs from their doorknob reading in Hebrew birkat habayit , " blessing of the home . " <p> I am the house ghost , in a way , spooking my way through the living room . Norris 's leather chair , so out of place in a room of institutional-style furniture , is opened in a reclining position with a thin blanket spread over the arm and a rummaged newspaper at its feet . I can imagine him sitting here , as he often does late at night , drinking tea and watching reruns of Baywatch on Lebanese television . In the kitchen I drink a glass of grapefruit juice . I make a sandwich , roasted eggplant and turkey tucked into pita , and take a canteen of ice out of the freezer , pack them in my knapsack along with my tools , and head to the door . <p> There is a note pinned to the door that reads , " P  --  Dinner with Jerrold March tonight at 8 . Prepare to present on shaft tombs .  --  N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not at the idea of dinner with Mr. March , one of our most generous sponsors . I 've met with him many times whenever I 've returned to New York , and he is always a perfect gentleman from the tip of his mustache to his deftness with a salad fork , harmlessly flirtatious after a few glasses of wine . It is easy to melt into his luxurious world , and fun to bring him into the world he funds , my dirty world of chamber pots and ceramic coffins . I 'm not angry even at Norris 's directive , although I already knew about dinner . I already have sketches to show Jerrold of official seals , basins , statuettes , and ivories , maps indicating where we 'd found the three thousand infant burial jars . Norris knows I 'm always prepared . We have been working here together for more than a decade . It is that the note is written on the back of the title page of my last book , an act obviously intended to upset me . The page had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , he smoothed it out to use it as scratch paper . To let me know how little he thinks of it , or me . <p> It 's not worth spending the most beautiful time of the day fuming over him . He 's been playing these games for so many months I 'm practically numb to them . When I step outside , closing the door softly behind me , my anger dissolves in the wet , clean , and shimmering air . I love the early morning . Pine trees cast long shadows across the road and clouds stained deep grape and plum are strewn messily over the horizon , as if someone had n't yet cleaned up the table linens after a giant party . <p> It is a two-mile walk to the tell . Every working morning I take this walk , leaving my old white Mazda in the driveway like a beached baby beluga . The air is tinged with rosemary , mint , and diesel . I try to drink in the coolness as I walk , knowing the sun will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist of sparkles over my clothes and my skin . The little hairs on my arms have been alchemized by the sun to fine gold . My naturally pale skin is gilded by exposure , despite my devotion to applying and reapplying lotion . I feel lean and able striding up the road , my mind clear . I enjoy the long stride of my body every morning before settling into a day of crouching in dirt . <p> The Judean Hills lie languid over the horizon and birds are winging between the pines . There is a Bedouin woman pulling up herbs down a stony slope . She is swathed in a long black robe , chanting in Arabic : Fear not if you wander the barley fields after there has been a good rain <br> And you find an old lover who was slain long ago has risen to meet you again . <p> I can see the museum at the bottom of the hill . I 've been working in Megiddo for twelve years , in the heart of the Jezreel Valley in the north of Israel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is an extraordinary site . Megiddo is a hill that spans about fifteen acres , made up of thirty cities built one on top of the other over six millennia , beginning with the prepottery Neolithic period nine thousand years ago . <p> The wrestlings of my own heart should be overshadowed in this valley of death . At least thirty-four nations have battled in this place , with enormous slaughters . This is where Pharaoh Thutmose III fought the first battle known in recorded history anywhere in the world . The author of the Book of Revelation predicted that in the end of days , the battle between good and evil will ultimately take place here . In fact , the word Armageddon is a corruption of the Hebrew phrase Har Megiddo , Mount of Megiddo . <p> Modern Israel is no stranger to conflict , and one does n't have to dig to remember . Every weapon created has been wielded here , and the newest generations , biological and nuclear , hang like Damocles 's sword over the young nation . To stay ahead , defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . I 've spent my career here underground with the ancients , without emerging much into today 's headlines . I 've been less interested in the political and religious conflict of any century and more interested in personal practice , mostly studying Middle Bronze Age mortuary practices . <p> In the past , countless have lived , thrived , and then bled here until they became bone . Today , millions come to visit , including historic visits ; the first visit of a pope to Israel took place here in Megiddo . Two hundred professionals dig here every working day . Norris directs them all , and I supervise twenty archaeologists and volunteers concentrating on the temples of stratum XV and the elaborate shaft tombs . <p> But each morning , like this one , there is just me . The generations below me are silent , and the tour buses have not yet rumbled in . In the half light , the site is empty . I cross the museum parking lot and begin to climb the tell . The land is perfectly still and mute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret gardens . When I dig my callused hands into the cool , predawn earth , I feel all of her richness tingle through my skin . Before dawn the land always seems to yield , hinting that , with just the right touch , everything dormant in her might awaken , push through its black chambers , and Ezekiel 's field of bones would drink the moist sky . <p> I walk through the remains of Solomon 's stables , the rows of dark cold arches . I imagine the din of whinnying and neighing echoing through the ancient hall . Sparse , thorny grasses and sharp foliage poke through the stones . <p> As I emerge from the maze of stables , the horizon wears a crown . The sun is just rising . I kneel beside my most recent project , the three thousand and seventy-second infant burial jar we 've unearthed . I put down my knapsack and unroll my pack of tools : a small pickax , a toothbrush , variously sized paintbrushes , and fine dental tools . The jar is shaped like a womb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointing for them to be delivered not by some messiah to life everlasting but by me , to a mention in my field notes . I begin to gently dust the rim of the jar , thinking . <p> It is hard for me to believe that I am thirty-nine years old . Looking at the swollen shape of the jar , I involuntarily draw my hand over my stomach . I used to wonder what it would be like to be round and full like that instead of empty , flat . To carry life inside me . I do n't think about it much anymore . I have never gotten myself tested to see if I have the Lou Gehrig 's gene like my father , like my grandfather . I tremble at the thought of bequeathing my fear to another , if not my child , then his or hers , a Damocles sword over all my generations . And at the same time ... <p> I sigh . The sky that had sagged so sweetly , as if the Kingdom of Heaven 's doormat was just within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbtack . I labor over the jar and its crumbled contents . " You would be , I 'd estimate , three thousand years old today , " I say . Some scholars have written that these are the remains of child sacrifices from an ancient cult . It 's possible , I shrug to myself . Infant mortality rates were astronomically high . Still are in many places . " I do n't know , " I say out loud to no one . " Either way , you probably were n't going to make it to your three-thousandth birthday anyhow . " I begin to hear the buzz of insects as the sun climbs , doing their jobs as well . Diggers are beginning to arrive . Soon my team will assemble and I 'll direct them . I pull out my notebook and lean in close to the jar , sketching the details . <p> " The early bird gets the urn , eh ? " <p> I sit back . Norris is standing over me , eclipsing the sun . I squint a little . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my note ? " he asks , tilting his head . I remember the crumpled page of my book tacked to the door and the plume of heat it fueled in me . I used to stew over his mockery for days . I wonder for a moment if the fact that I 've started to become used to it , that I can recover so quickly , is a bad sign . A sign I 've accepted abuse as the norm . It was n't always this way . <p> Norris , my professor of Levantine archaeology at Columbia , had been a great supporter of my first book , Body of Water , Body of Air : Water and Theology in Ancient Israel . My second book , Up in Smoke , was based on my thesis , a study of cultic theology and connections between altars found in Israel , especially at Megiddo , and altars found throughout the Middle East , tracing borrowed cultic practices throughout the region . The new manuscript , Upon This Altar , was a follow-up to Up in Smoke . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altars , that I began to see them everywhere . In the shape of my desk there was an altar . A baby 's pram was an altar . The park bench . I developed a new philosophy , which I tried to expound in my introduction to the book , exploring the idea that when there were no more altars in space , there would always be altars in time . That there are moments , precious and sacred , when something intangible but terrible is slain , and we are born into a new light . When it happens , the moment could be called forgiveness , or mercy , or even love . <p> I was delirious with confidence . I was ecstatic for its release . I had written it in a trance . It was , in retrospect , probably just a crappy little book . But it was important to me . I could n't wait to hear what my peers would think of my multidisciplinary approach . <p> As it turned out , no one thought very much of it . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand it , or did n't like it . One critic wrote , " One has to wonder what sort of incense burned on Brookstone 's own altar when she wrote her prologue . " But the worst criticism came from the one person I 'd come to depend upon for unconditional support . <p> So sure was I that Norris would love my " altarism " philosophy that I denied his requests to read the early manuscript and made him wait until the book was actually published . The day a box full of books landed on our doorstep , I came home to find Norris holding up a copy , the veins rising to the surface of his scaly neck . <p> He said , " What the hell are you talking about ? What do you think you are  --  some kind of New Age theologian ? You going to start wandering around Jerusalem with the other lunatics ? This is scholarship ? This is a dozen years at Megiddo ? " <p> Norris had never raised his voice to me , and only once had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in his bedroom with the door , for once , closed . <p> He continued in a mocking tone , reading from the introduction , " What does this even mean , ' When you encounter an altar in time , you slip into serenity , just one letter to the left of eternity ' ? " <p> I tried to explain , bewildered by his anger , " The difference between serenity and eternity is that the s becomes a t , and s is to the left of t in the alphabet . " <p> " What , now we 're playing word games ? You expect people to figure that out ? You expect people to care ? " <p> Norris fumed at me , crumpling the torn cover of my book in his fist . That afternoon , I felt as though my father had died a second time . I knew that his anger had little to do with the book and instead was about what had happened between us a few weeks earlier working in the pit  --  that unfortunate kiss  --  something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago , and since then I 've been walking on eggshells . <p> I look up at Norris . When I first met him he was in his late forties , and today , over a dozen years later , he still looks like he is in his late forties . He is tall and ruddily attractive , his arms and legs sinewy and brown , his dark hair salted , skin weathered . He looks like a man who has had many adventures . I had originally perceived him as some kind of golden emissary , rising up from the sacred rubble of the Holy Land , full of wisdom . His first lecture dazzled me . It was not until later that I discovered the streaks in his hair and the bronze of his face were less the distinctions of heroism and more simply signs of sun damage , his face sun-dried and preserved , the corners of his brown eyes bouquets of tawny creases . He was attractive , an eloquent speaker , a fine supervisor , and oppressive to the people he loved best . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saw the note . By the way , I saw chicken in the freezer . Jerrold always orders steak . " <p> " I 've known Jerrold a lot longer than you , " he says , laughing lightly at me as if I am a child . <p> My head is down over my sketchbook but I can see Norris 's boots still planted nearby . I know he 's not leaving just yet , so I put the book aside and stretch out my legs . We need to get beyond this . <p> I ask him casually , " Will the photographs of the mosaic be ready ? " <p> He squats down , his knees popping . " They should be finished today . Oldest known church in the world ! Astounding ! " <p> Norris 's pride is well earned . I have been meaning to send digital pictures of the recently uncovered mosaic to Father Chuck Oren , my family 's priest , with whom I 've remained in touch . He will be electrified to see the circular pattern in the center depicting two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that predates the cross by at least a thousand years . <p> It should excite me too , but for some time now I 've been longing for something deeper , something more alive . I became an archaeologist because I thought that in drawing cities and remains out of the dust , I could bring a small part of them back to life . I conjured up the spirits locked in the bones and beads of the people who dwelled in this land millennia ago . I believed I could rub lanterns and set the dream of them free . I have been digging through graves looking for proof that civilizations , people , and stories do n't really ever die , but what I 've learned , over and over , is that they always do . Maybe I have to step back from it all a little , the way one looks at a mosaic , to be able to see how all the brokenness actually fits together into a greater design . <p> " You know , people would give their right arm to do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " yet you seem disappointed . What did you think you would find "  --  he guffaws lightly  --  " a photo album ? " <p> " Maybe , " I say , twisting my lips to the side in thought . " Or a diary . " <p> Norris now laughs heartily . Then he sits all the way down . He picks up my sketchbook and looks at my drawings . All at once , he is my professor again , whom I admired so much . <p> " There is an Ugaritic epic in which the virgin goddess Anat avenges her husband-brother 's death by searching for his murderer , Mot , the god of death , " he says . He glances from the sketchbook to the burial jar and back . " When she finds Mot , she chops him into little pieces , grinds him up , and spreads him over the fields like fertilizer . " <p> " Huh , " I say . <p> He glances at me , then back to the book , and goes on , encouraged , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we owe to the earth , ensuring the earth 's fertility . Think about sacrifices offered to ensure a grain harvest . " <p> " For dust you are and to dust you shall return , " I say quietly , partly to Norris and partly to the 3000-year-old infant in the jar . <p> " Right , but the return is purposeful , no ? The life of the child becomes the life of the wheat , fields and fields of it . " He thinks for a moment . " Burial is a planting ... " <p> A pretty idea , but I do n't buy it . Still , I 'm interested . And I 'm curious , tentatively , about whether Norris is reaching out to me . " So she actually kills the god of death and her husband gets resurrected ? " <p> " Alas , " Norris sighs . " As the epic continues , with the death of death , Anat 's husband-brother returns to life . But so does Mot . And the cycle continues "  --  he gestures toward the burial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm disappointed but not surprised . " So the god of death 's own death is annulled by his death . " <p> Norris reaches out and pats my head as if I 'm a puppy . " Aw , poor Page . What is a goddess to do ? " He stands up and twists his back hard . I hear his bones pop again . I look up at him and find no tenderness there . He shakes his head slowly and pouts in pretend pity . " Always on the losing end . " <br> <p> We spend the early evening straightening the house for Jerrold 's visit . We all share in the rent , but Norris as the supervisor , having served this dig for almost thirty years , keeps the master suite . The Bograshovs have the second-largest room , with private bathroom as well . My bedroom is the smallest , but it has the nicest morning light , as it faces east . I can reach my hand out my window and pick tomatoes right from our garden and often do  --  ripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hall is understood as mine , and for guests . It is a modest limestone house , windows arched in the classic Middle Eastern style . Orna is in her midtwenties , and the rest of us probably seem , in varying degrees , beyond the age bracket for house sharing , although it is not unusual in this region . Financially it has made sense . Norris still pays hefty spousal support to his wife in California . The Bograshovs are saving , dreaming of starting a family someday . And I have maintained my apartment in New York City , which I try to visit at least twice a year , when I return to lecture and to visit my mother and my closest friend , Jordanna . It sometimes seems foolish to keep it , that empty cube filled with furniture quietly waiting all year to be used : the empty bed and desk in the one tiny bedroom , small empty loveseat , breakfast table with the leaves folded down , cold two-burner stove in the wall kitchen . But I 've always felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , utterly rootless . I love when I return there and collapse into a chair , looking at the beveled ceiling and listening to footsteps cross the floor above me . Sometimes I wonder , however , if the opposite is true , if maintaining it all these years has prevented me from taking more risks and finding a real place to call home , rather than a rent-controlled barrenness . <p> Jerrold arrives in a herringbone suit and a thin black cashmere turtleneck underneath . His silver hair is shaped and gleaming over his head like poured metal , mustache slicked into place . His presence is of prosperity , his skin tight over his face and appropriately bronzed , teeth surprisingly white . He is worldly , sophisticated . Older than Norris , he walks into our home with shiny shoes and a silver-tipped cane , carrying two bottles of C ( tes du Rh ( ne . I have showered , pulled my hair back into a clip , and put on a simple black dress . We all look nice but clearly underfunded . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olives , and pine nuts over a mound of couscous . <p> " Tell me , Mikhail , " Jerrold drawls while Norris dishes out the meal , " what is your specialty ? I 've heard rumor you are a garbage man ! " <p> " Indeed , " Mickey says in his heavy Russian accent , which somehow always makes it seem as if he is reciting something . " Everyone should spend at least a year collecting and sorting garbage . Yesterday 's dinners , news clippings , and junk can tell you more about human behavior and consumption than anything else . From an archaeologist 's perspective , garbage is the great chronicle of life . " <p> " Well said ! Good man , " Jerrold says enthusiastically . " Let 's open that wine and toast . A toast to garbage ! " <p> Norris wrestles with the wine bottle between his knees . He says , lest Jerrold should really think Mickey is a garbage man , " When Mickey emigrated from Russia , he had multiple degrees . " He huffs a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropology , paleontology , linguistics , and chem . He spoke six languages , but not Hebrew , at the time . The only work he could find in his early years was as a garbage collector . " <p> " I met him when I was a docent at the Diaspora museum , " says Orna . She has Moroccan features and sapphire eyes . " He was an Aladdin 's lamp in a heap of trash . " <p> Mickey puts his arm around Orna and says , " I only needed one rub . " <p> Orna blushes deeply and Jerrold laughs mightily , lifting his glass to Orna , adding , " And then all your wishes came true ! " He continues , " A toast ... but wait , Norris my boy , you have no wine . You must ! It is a nineteen forty-two bottle ! " <p> " Yes . " Norris clears his throat a bit nervously . " None for me , thanks . " He looks to me for the briefest moment , and Jerrold notices . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this house ! I see , yes , I 've always wondered , an old dog like yourself sharing a roof with one of your former students . " He slaps the table . " You bastard ! Of course you had to hire the prettiest one ! " <p> I laugh . " Thanks , Mr. March . " <p> Jerrold hands his glass to Norris and then pours himself another and says exuberantly , " To garbage ! Because it is messy ! " <p> Glasses clink and Norris says soberly , " Yes , well , Mickey speaks of garbage with exaggerated romanticism . " <p> " But he 's right ! " says Jerrold . " Ah yes , trash , other people 's trash , it is romantic ! Lost sandals and scandals and partially burned candles ... it 's poetry , you see ? " <p> After speaking about the mosaic , which is far more interesting than my shaft tombs , and after a few more glasses of wine , Jerrold rests his face in one of his big hands , leaning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Page , yes , the thing about Page is that I 've never met a human being who knows the Bible better than this one .

" <p> Norris answers , a little clipped , " Ms. Brookstone studied Christian theology at Harvard Divinity . " <p> " Yes . " Jerrold nods . " I remember now . " He looks deeply into my face , and I can see he 's a little drunk . " All those blood-soaked texts , the Levitical sacrifices , the blood on the altars , the blood on the doorways , whoever sheds the blood of man by man shall his blood be shed ... " With his fingers Jerrold picks up a chicken leg out of the bowl in the center of the table . He points it at me and says , " You sucked the marrow out of the Bible until there was nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . I can feel the wine warming me as well , can see it creeping over everyone . Only Norris remains rigid . <p> Mickey says , " Every night , she filled her bathtub with Bible stories the way Countess Bathory of Transylvania would fill her tub with the blood of virgins , to achieve eternal beauty , to live forever . " <p> Orna slaps her husband playfully against the arm . <p> " It looks to me like it 's working , " Jerrold says , eyes absorbing my face . <p> " But I left Harvard , " I say , " after I heard a lecture by Dr. Norris Anderson . I remember it so clearly . He said , ' Archaeology is the place where the precision of science and the intuitive certainty of faith intersect . ' I was so impressed . I gave up my pursuit of a doctorate in divinity for a master 's in archaeology . " <p> Jerrold 's eyes sparkle and dance . " You abandoned armchair philosophy to pursue the philosopher 's stone . A noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , the thing Ms. Brookstone wants desperately to find more than anything else at Megiddo is a diary . " <p> " Adorable ! " bursts Jerrold . " A diary ! Now that would be something ! " He extends his head over the table toward me , closes his eyes for a moment , and breathes , as if inhaling perfume . " Now , I 'll bet you kept a diary when you were a girl . " <p> " No , " I say , " but there was this time when our family 's pastor , Father Chuck , got so angry at me . " <p> " Yes , tell me , " Jerrold croons . " I 'd love to know where this leads . " <p> " He had told us the Noah story , that a man could build a boat to fit all those animals , and I just could n't believe it , so I said so . " <p> Orna says , " Always challenging things , even as a child ! " <p> " Father Chuck turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . He took his chair and brought it to the other side of my desk and sat down . He put his elbows on my desk , right on top of my illustrated children 's Bible . He was very young for a priest , and he stared straight into me , as if there were n't fifteen other students in the room . " <p> " Indeed , I 'm sure . " Jerrold nods vigorously . <p> " He said , ' Thousands of years from now , long after you and everyone you know are dead , someone will find the ruins of your house . They will pick through the rubble and sift through the sand . And you know what they will find ? ' " <p> " Trash ! " Jerrold erupts . " Mountains and mountains of trash ! " <p> " That 's right , " Mickey affirms , raising his glass . <p> I shook my head . " ' Two books , ' he said . ' And in one there will be all our records  --  school records , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts , degrees , honorable mentions ... and in the other book , they will find a diary . A diary of all the dreams of all the people .

The other book would be the cold facts , but this book would be the deep truth . ' " <p> " The Bible is the diary of dreams , " Orna says , mesmerized . <p> " I 'm in love . " Jerrold heaves a sigh . " Ask me for anything , Page . Even half the kingdom and I 'll give it to you . " <p> Norris is glowering . I feel suddenly a little sad for him . When he hired me to come to Megiddo , Norris had just finalized a bitter divorce . He had a daughter just a couple of years younger than I who lived with his ex-wife and refused to speak with him , even though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had sensed that he thought of me like a daughter , someone he could mentor who 'd appreciate him . I thought we comforted one another . I knew very little about his ex-wife or the divorce .

" <p> I say , " That first time I heard Norris speak , he reminded me of Father Chuck . They are both so fluent and persuasive . " <p> At this , Norris laughs sharply , pushes his chair away from the table with a screech , and begins loudly clearing plates . " Yeah , me , " he says while making a racket with the dishes , " a fuckin ' priest . That 's how she thinks of me . " <p> After Jerrold leaves , Orna and Mickey insist on cleaning up . I fill up a canteen to put in the freezer for work tomorrow and Norris brushes past me and scowls .
