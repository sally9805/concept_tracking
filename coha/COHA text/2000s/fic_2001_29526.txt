" I just heard the news bulletin on my car radio . " Tiel McCoy did n't begin this telephone conversation with any superfluous chitchat . That was her opening statement the instant Gully said hello . No preamble was necessary . Truth be known , he had probably been expecting her call . But he played dumb anyway . " That you , Tiel ? Enjoying your vacation so far ? " Her vacation had officially begun that morning when she left Dallas and headed west on Interstate 20 . She had driven as far as Abilene , where she stopped to visit her uncle , who 'd lived in a nursing home there for the past five years . She remembered Uncle Pete as a tall , robust man with an irreverent sense of humor , who could barbecue a mean brisket and knock a softball out of the park . Today they had shared a lunch of soggy fish sticks and canned English peas and watched an episode of Guiding Light . She 'd asked if there was anything she could do for him while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine . He had smiled at her sadly and thanked her for coming , then gave himself over to an attendant who 'd tucked him in for his nap like a child . Outside the nursing home , Tiel had gratefully inhaled the scorching , gritty West Texas air in the hope of eradicating the smell of age and resignation which had permeated the facility . She had been relieved the family obligation was behind her , but felt guilty for the relief . By an act of will she shook off her despair and reminded herself that she was on vacation . It was n't even officially summer yet , but it was unseasonably warm for May . There 'd been no shade in which to park at the nursing home ; consequently her car 's interior had been so hot she could have baked cookies on the dashboard . She flipped on the AC full-blast and found a radio station that played something other than Garth , George , and Willie . " I 'm going to have a wonderful time . The time away will be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having done it . " She repeated this internal dialogue like a catechism , trying to convince herself of the truth of it . She had approached the vacation as though it were equivalent to taking a bad-tasting laxative . Heat waves made the highway appear to ripple , and the undulating movement was hypnotic . The driving became mindless . Her mind drifted . The radio provided background noise of which Tiel was barely aware . But hearing the news bulletin was like getting goosed by the driver 's seat . With a lurch , everything acceleratedthe car , Tiel 's heart rate , her mind . Immediately she fished her cell phone from her large leather satchel and placed the call to Gully 's direct line . Again declining any unnecessary conversation , she said to him now , " Give me the skinny . " " What 's the radio putting out ? " " That earlier today a high school student in Fort Worth kidnaped Russell Dendy 's daughter . " " That 's about the gist of it , " Gully confirmed . " The gist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on vacation , Tiel . " " I 'm coming back . Next exit , I 'll make a U-turn . " She consulted her dashboard clock . " I 'll be at the station by " " Hold on , hold on . Where 're you at , exactly ? " " About fifty miles west of Abilene . " " Hmm . " " What , Gully ? " Her palms had become damp . She experienced the familiar tickle in her belly that only happened when she was following a hot lead to a super story . That unique adrenaline rush could n't be mistaken . " You 're on your way to Angel Fire , right ? " " Right . " " Northeastern part of New Mexico . . . Yeah , there it is . " He must have been reading a highway map as he spoke . " Naw , never mind . You do n't want this assignment , Tiel . It would take you out of your way . " He was baiting her , and she knew he was baiting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baited . She wanted a piece of this story . The kidnaping of Russell Dendy 's daughter was big news , and it promised to become even bigger news before it was over . " I do n't mind taking a detour . Tell me where to go . " " Well , " he hedged , " only if you 're sure . " " I 'm sure . " " Okay then . Not too far in front of you is a turnoff onto state highway Two-oh-eight . Take it south to San Angelo . On the south side of San Angelo you 're gon na intersect with " " Gully , about how far out of my way is this detour going to take me ? " " I thought you did n't care . " " I do n't . I 'd just like to know . Rough estimate . " " Well , let 's see . Give or take . . . about three hundred miles . " " From Angel Fire ? " she asked faintly . " From where you are now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire . " " Three hundred round trip ? " " One way . " She expelled a long sigh , but was careful not to let him hear it . " You said highway Two-oh-eight south to San Angelo , then what ? " She steered with her knee , held the phone with her left hand , and took notes with her right . The car was on cruise control , but her brain was in overdrive . Journalistic juices were pumping faster than the pistons in her engine . Thoughts of long pleasant evenings spent in a porch rocker were swapped for those of sound bites and interviews . But she was getting ahead of herself . She lacked pertinent facts . When she asked for them , Gully , damn him , turned mulish on her . " Not now , Tiel . I 'm as busy as a one-armed paperhanger , and you 've got miles to cover . By the time you get where you 're going , I 'll have a lot more info . " Frustrated and supremely irked with him for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the name of the town again ? " " Hera . " The highways were arrow-straight , flanked on both sides by endless prairie with only an occasional herd of cattle grazing in irrigated pastures . Oil wells were silhouetted against a cloudless horizon . Frequently a tumbleweed rolled across the roadway in front of her . Once she got beyond San Angelo , she rarely saw another vehicle . Funny , she thought , the way things turn out . Ordinarily she would have elected to fly to New Mexico . But days ago she had decided to drive to Angel Fire , not only so she could visit Uncle Pete along the way , but also to get herself into a holiday frame of mind . The long drive would give her time to decompress , work the kinks out , begin the period of rest and relaxation before she ever reached the mountain resort , so that when she did arrive , she would already be in vacation mode . At home in Dallas , she moved with the speed of light , always in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once she had reached the western fringe of Fort Worth and put the metropolitan sprawl behind her , when the vacation became a reality , she had begun to anticipate the idyllic days awaiting her . She had daydreamed of clear , gurgling streams , hikes along trails lined with aspens , cool , crisp air , and lazy mornings spent with a cup of coffee and a fiction best-seller . There would be no schedule to keep , nothing but hours in which to be lazy , which was a virtue unto itself . Tiel McCoy was way past due to engage in some unabashed ennui . She 'd already postponed this vacation three times . " Use ' em or lose ' em , " Gully had told her of the vacation days she had accumulated . He had lectured her on how her performance , as well as her disposition , would greatly improve if she gave herself a breather . This from the man who had n't taken more than a few vacation days in the past forty-something yearscounting the week required to have his gallbladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had scowled at her . " Precisely . You want to wind up an ugly , shriveled , pathetic relic like me ? " Then he 'd really hit the nail on the head . " Taking a vacation is n't going to jeopardize your chances . That job 'll still be up for grabs when you get back . " She easily inferred the meaning behind that sly remark . Miffed at him for homing in on the real reason behind her reluctance to leave work for any period of time , she had grudgingly consented to going away for a week . The reservations had been made , the trip scheduled . But every schedule should have a little bit of flexibility built in . And if flexibility was ever called for , it was when Russell Dendy 's daughter was allegedly kidnaped . Tiel held the pay phone 's sticky receiver pinched between the pads of her thumb and index finger , loathe to touch any more of the surface than necessary . " Okay , Gully , I 'm here . Well , near , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Too excited to concentrate on where you 're going ? " " Well , it 's not like I 've missed a thriving metropolis . You said yourself , the place is n't even on most maps . " Her sense of humor had worn off about the time she 'd lost all feeling in her butt . Hours ago , her posterior had gone numb from sitting . Since talking to him , she had stopped only once , and then only out of extreme necessity . She was hungry , thirsty , tired , cranky , achy , and none too fresh because she 'd been facing into the setting sun for a long portion of the trip . The car 's AC had gone humid from overuse . A shower would be bliss . Gully did n't improve her mood any by asking , " How 'd you manage to get lost ? " " I lost my sense of direction after the sun went down . The landscape looks the same from every angle out here . Even more so after dark . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of eight hundred twenty-three , according to the city-limit sign , and I think the chamber of commerce fudged that number in their favor . This is the only lighted building for miles around . The town is called Rojo something . " " Flats . Rojo Flats . " Naturally Gully knew the full name of this obscure hamlet . He probably knew the mayor 's name . Gully knew everything . He was a walking encyclopedia . He collected information the way frat rats collected coeds ' phone numbers . The TV station where Tiel worked had a news director , but the man with the title conducted business from inside a carpeted office and was more a bean counter and administrator than a hands-on boss . The man in the trenches , the one who dealt directly with the reporters , writers , photographers , and editors , the one who coordinated schedules and listened to sob stories and chewed ass when ass-chewing was called for , the one who actually ran the news operation , was the assignments editor , Gully . He 'd been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had mandated that they would have to carry him out of the place feetfirst . He would die before he retired . He worked a sixteen-hour day and begrudged the time he was n't working . He had a colorful vocabulary and countless similes , an extensive repertoire of yarns about bygone days in broadcast news , and seemingly no life beyond the newsroom . His first name was Yarborough , but only a few living persons knew that . Everyone else knew him strictly as Gully . " Are you going to give me this mysterious assignment or not ? " He would n't be rushed . " What happened to your vacation plans ? " " Nothing . I 'm still on vacation . " " Uh-huh . " " I am ! I 'm not canceling my week off . I 'm just postponing the start of it , that 's all . " " What 's the new boyfriend gon na say ? " " I 've told you a thousand times , there is no new boyfriend . " He laughed his phlegmy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that she knew he knew . " Got your notepad ? " he asked suddenly . " Uh , yeah . " Whatever germs had been teeming on the telephone were probably living with her now . Reconciled to that , she propped the receiver on her shoulder and held it there with her cheek while she removed a notepad and pen from her satchel and placed them on the narrow metal ledge beneath the wall-mounted telephone . " Shoot . " " The boy 's name is Ronald Davison , " Gully began . " I heard that much on the radio . " " Goes by Ronnie . Senior year , same as the Dendy girl . Wo n't graduate with any honors , but he 's a solid B student . Never in trouble until today . After homeroom this morning , he boogied out of the student parking lot in his Toyota pickup with Sabra Dendy riding shotgun . " " Russ Dendy 's child . " " His one and only . " " Is the FBI on it ? " " FBI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a badge , it 's working this one . Waco all over again . Everybody 's claiming jurisdiction and wants in on the action . " Tiel took a moment to absorb the broad scope of this story . The short hallway in which the pay phone was located led to the public rest rooms . One had a cowgirl in a fringed skirt stenciled in blue paint on the door . The other , predictably , had a similar silhouette of a cowpoke in chaps and ten-gallon hat , twirling a lasso above his head . Glancing down the hall , Tiel spotted the real thing coming into the store . Tall , slender , Stetson pulled down low on his forehead . He nodded toward the store 's cashier , whose frizzy , overpermed hair had been dyed an unflattering shade of ocher . Nearer to Tiel was an elderly couple browsing for souvenirs , apparently in no hurry to return to their Winnebago . At least Tiel assumed the Winnebago at the gas pumps outside belonged to them . Through bifocal eyeglasses the lady was reading the ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaim , " Jalapeo pepper jelly ? Good lord . " The couple then joined Tiel in the hallway , moving toward their respective rest rooms . " Do n't dally , Gladys , " the man said . His white legs were virtually hairless and looked ridiculously thin in his baggy khaki shorts and thick-soled athletic shoes . " You mind your business , and I 'll mind mine , " she retorted smartly . As she moved past Tiel she gave her a **45;467;TOOLONG wink . Another time , Tiel would have thought the senior couple cute and endearing . But she was thoughtfully reading what she 'd taken down almost verbatim from Gully . " You said riding shotgun . ' Strange choice of words , Gully . " " Can you keep a secret ? " He lowered his voice significantly . " Because my ass will be grass if this gets out before our next newscast . We 've scooped every other station and newspaper in the state . " Tiel 's scalp began to tingle , as it did when she knew she was hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had uncovered the element that would set her story apart from all the others , when her exclusive had the potential of winning her a journalism prize or praise from her peers . Or of guaranteeing her the coveted spot on Nine Live . " Who would I tell , Gully ? I 'm sharing space with a fresh-off-the-range cowboy buying a six-pack of Bud , a sassy granny lady and her husband from out of stateI 'm guessing by their accents . And two non-English-speaking Mexicans . " The pair had since come into the store . She 'd overheard them speaking Spanish while heating packaged burritos in a microwave oven . Gully said , " Linda " " Linda ? She got the story ? " " You 're on vacation , remember ? " " A vacation you urged me to take ! " Tiel exclaimed . Linda Harper was another reporter , a darned good reporter , and Tiel 's unspoken rival . It stung that Gully had assigned Linda to cover such a plum of a story , which rightfully should have belonged to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want to hear this or not ? " he asked cantankerously . " Go ahead . " The elderly man emerged from the men 's room . He moved to the end of the hall , where he paused to wait for his wife . To kill time , he took a camcorder from a nylon airline bag and began tinkering with it . Gully said , " Linda interviewed Sabra Dendy 's best friend this afternoon . Hold on to your hat . The Dendy girl is pregnant with Ronnie Davison 's kid . Eight months gone . They 've been hiding it . " " You 're kidding ! And the Dendys did n't know ? " " According to the friend , nobody did . That is , not until last night . The kids broke the news to their parents , and Russ Dendy went apeshit . " Tiel 's mind was already racing ahead , filling in the blanks . " So this is n't a kidnaping . It 's a contemporary Romeo and Juliet . " " I did n't say that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 'd be my first guess . A view shared by Sabra Dendy 's best friend and confidante . She claims Ronnie Davison is crazy about Sabra and would n't harm a hair on her head . Said Russell Dendy has been fighting this romance for more than a year . Nobody 's good enough for his daughter , they 're too young to know their own minds , college is a must , and so forth . You get the picture . " " I do . " And what was wrong with the picture was that Tiel McCoy was n't in it and Linda Harper was . Damn ! Of all times to go on vacation . " I 'm coming back tonight , Gully . " " No . " " I think you sent me on this wild goose chase so it would be impossible for me to return . " " Not true . " " How far am I from El Paso ? " " El Paso ? Who said anything about El Paso ? " " Or San Antonio . Whichever is closer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning . Do you have their schedule handy ? What time does the first flight depart for Dallas ? " " Listen to me , Tiel . We 've got it covered . Bob 's working the manhuntlaw enforcement angle . Linda 's on the kids ' friends , teachers , and families . Steve 's practically moved into the Dendys ' mansion , so he 'll be there if a ransom call comes in , which I do n't expect . And , bottom line , those kids 'll probably turn up before you could get back to Dallas anyway . " " So what am I doing out here in the middle of freaking nowhere ? " The old man shot her a curious glance over his shoulder . " Listen , " Gully hissed . " The friend ? Sabra mentioned to her a few weeks back that she and Ronnie might just hightail it to Mexico . " Mollified because she was closer to the Mexican border than she was to Dallas , Tiel asked , " Where in Mexico ? " " She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to twist her arm to get that much from her . She did n't want to betray Sabra 's confidence . But the one thing she did say is that Ronnie 's dadhis real dad ; his mom 's remarriedis sympathetic to their predicament . A while back he offered his help if they ever needed it . Now , you 're gon na feel really bad about yelling at me when I tell you where he hangs his hat . " " Hera . " " Satisfied ? " She should have apologized , but she did n't . Gully understood . " Who else knows about this ? " " Nobody . But they will . It works to our advantage that Hera is a one-horse town , not on any beaten path . " " Tell me about it , " she muttered . " When word gets out , it 'll take everybody a while to get there , even by helicopter . You 've got a definite head start . " " Gully , I love you ! " she said excitedly . " Direct me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies ' room and rejoined her husband . She admonished him for fiddling with the camcorder and ordered him to put it back in the tote bag before he broke it . " Like you 're an expert with video cameras , " the old man retorted . " I took the time to read the instruction book . You did n't . " Tiel poked her finger in her ear so she could hear Gully better . " What 's the dad 's name ? Davison , I presume . " " I 've got an address and phone number . " Tiel wrote down the information as fast as he reeled it off . " Do I have an appointment with him ? " " Working on it . He might not agree to go on camera . " " I 'll get him to agree , " she said confidently . " I 'm dispatching a chopper with a photographer . " " Kip if he 's available . " " Y'all can meet in Hera . You 'll do the interview tomorrow as soon as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your merry way . " " Unless there 's more story there . " " Uh-uh . That 's the condition , Tiel . " She envisioned him stubbornly shaking his head . " You do this bit , then you 're off to Angel Fire . Period . End of discussion . " " Whatever you say . " She could easily agree now , then argue about it later if events warranted . " Okay , let 's see . Outta Rojo Flats . . . " The map must have been right there on his desk , because within seconds he was giving her further directions . " Should n't take you long to get there . You 're not sleepy , are you ? " She was never more wide awake than when pursuing a story . Her problem was shutting her mind off and going to sleep . " I 'll buy something caffeinated to take along . " " Check in with me as soon as you get there . I 've got you a room reserved at the only motel . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinking traffic lightthe one and only . They 'll wait up for you to give you a room key . " Changing subjects , he asked , " Is the new boyfriend going to be pissed ? " " For the last time , Gully , there is no new boyfriend . " She hung up and placed another callto her new boyfriend . Joseph Marcus was as much a workaholic as she was . He was scheduled to fly out early the next day , so she predicted he would be working late at his desk , putting things in order prior to his being away for several days . She was right . He answered his office phone on the second ring . " Do you get paid overtime ? " she teased . " Tiel ? Hi . I 'm glad you called . " " It 's after hours . I was afraid you would n't answer . " " Reflex . Where are you ? " " The end of nowhere . " " Everything okay ? You have n't had car trouble or anything ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple of reasons . First , because I miss you . " This was the tack to take . Establish that the trip was still on . Establish that it was being delayed , not derailed . Assure him that everything was cool , then inform him of the slight wrinkle in their plans for a romantic getaway . " You saw me just last night . " " But only briefly , and it 's been a long day . Secondly , I called to remind you to throw a swimsuit into your suitcase . The hot tub at the condo complex is public . " After a pause , he said , " Actually , Tiel , it 's good that you called . I needed to talk to you . " Something in the tone of his voice prevented her from prattling on . She stopped talking and waited for him to fill the silence that yawned between them . " I could have called you on your cell phone today , but this is n't the sort of thing . . . The fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . You ca n't begin to know how sorry I am . " Tiel stared at the countless perforations in the metal surrounding the telephone . She stared so long without blinking that the tiny holes ran together . Absently she wondered what purpose they served . " I 'm afraid I ca n't get away tomorrow . " She 'd been holding her breath . Now she released it , relieved . His change of plans alleviated her guilt over having to change them herself . However , before she could speak , he continued . " I know how much you 'd looked forward to this trip . And so had I , " he rushed to add . " Let me make this easier on you , Joseph . " Meekly she confessed . " The truth is , I was calling to say that I need another couple days before I can get to Angel Fire . So I 'm fine with a short postponement . Would your schedule allow us to meet on , say , Tuesday instead of tomorrow ? " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't meet you at all . " The perforations ran together again . " Oh . I see . That is disappointing . Well " " It 's been very tense around here . My wife found my airline ticket and " " Excuse me ? " " I said my wife found " " You 're married ? " " Well . . . yeah . I thought you knew . " " No . " Her facial muscles felt stiff and inflexible . " You have failed to mention a Mrs. Marcus . " " Because my marriage has nothing to do with you , with us . It has n't been a real marriage for a long time . Once I 've explained my situation at home to you , you 'll understand . " " You 're married . " This time it was a statement , not a question . " Tiel , listen " " No , no , I 'm not going to listen , Joseph . What I 'm going to do is hang up on you , you son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant even to touch ten minutes earlier she now clung to long after replacing it on the hook . She leaned against the pay phone , her forehead pressing hard against the perforated metal while her hands maintained their grip on the greasy receiver . Married . He had seemed too good to be true , and he was . Good-looking , charming , friendly , witty , athletic , successful , and financially secure Joseph Marcus was married . If not for an airline ticket she would have had an affair with a married man . She swallowed a surge of nausea and took another moment to compose herself . Later she would lick her wounded ego , berate herself for being such a Pollyanna , and curse him to hell and back . But right now she had work to do . Joseph 's revelation had left her reeling with disbelief . She was furious beyond measure . She was terribly hurt , but more than anything she was embarrassed by her gullibility . All the more reason she was not about to let the bastard affect her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she was happy , she worked . Sad , she worked . Sick , she worked . Work was the cure for all her ills . Work was the remedy for everything . . . even heartbreak so profound you thought you 'd die . She knew that firsthand . She gathered up her pride , along with her notes on the Dendy story and Gully 's directions to Hera , Texas , and ordered herself to mobilize . Compared to the dimness of the hallway , the fluorescent lighting in the store seemed inordinately bright . The cowboy had left . The elderly couple were browsing through the array of magazines . The two Spanish-speaking men were eating their burritos and talking quietly together . Tiel sensed their smoldering gazes as she went past them on her way to the refrigerated cabinets . One said something to the other that caused him to snicker . It was easy to guess the nature of the comment . Thankfully , her Spanish was rusty . She slid open the door to the refrigerator and selected a six-pack of high-voltage cola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she chose a package of sunflower seeds . During college she had discovered that cracking open the salty seeds in order to get to the kernel inside was a good manual exercise to keep one awake while studying . Hopefully it would translate to night driving as well . She debated whether or not to buy a bag of chocolate-covered caramels . Just because a man she had been dating for weeks had turned out to be a married shit-heel did n't mean she should use that as an excuse to binge . On the other hand , if ever she deserved a treat The security camera in the corner of the ceiling virtually exploded , sending pieces of glass and metal flying . Instinctively Tiel recoiled from the deafening noise . But the camera had n't exploded on its own . A young man had entered the store and fired a pistol at it . The gunman then aimed his weapon at the cashier , who screeched a high note before the sound seemed to freeze inside her throat . " This is a holdup , " he said melodramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . To the young woman who had accompanied him into the store , he said , " Sabra , watch the others . If anyone moves , warn me . " " Okay , Ronnie . " Well , I might die , Tiel thought . But at least I 'll get my story . And she would n't be going to Hera to get it . It had come to her .
