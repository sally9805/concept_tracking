Born , raised , and still in Dayton , Reba Keylon , with husband Don , reclines La-Z-Boy style . " We mostly live a very simple life , " Reba says , // It was Thursday night in Dayton , Tennessee , and from the McDonald 's on Highway 27 you could hear the sound of gospel music floating high above the Golden Arches . It was fast food for the soul-a mix of Big Macs and hymns like " Hillbilly Heaven " and " Have a Little Talk With Jesus . " Among the gathered was Marcella Harris , who used to be a honky-tonk singer but changed her tune and was saved . And Henry Harris ( no relation ) , who answered the call 25 years ago when he was running a bulldozer in a gravel pit and heard the voice of the Lord in the sound of the machine 's gears . The McDonald 's gospel sing has been going for two years and is so popular that , word has it , Wendy 's is about to start one too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a town 20 minutes down the road , Anna Kyle informed me . A tiny woman with a mass of golden curls , Kyle acts as unofficial hostess for the big sing . " Hardee 's holds theirs the same night as ours ; " she added . She did not look pleased . In Dayton you can spend practically every night worshiping : the Wednesday night prayer meeting , the gospel sing on Thursday , a Friday night " Jesus Jam " ( Jesus is an " awesome dude , " one teen explained ) , and a performance by the Dayton Christian Ballet on Saturday . To the question " Why are folks in Dayton so passionately religious ? " Daytonians would answer : " Why is everyone else not ? " There are places to live , and there are communities . Dayton is a community . It 's a town where generosity is a given , whether in the form of a casserole or a grant for a local college , a place where kids grow up without the threat of drive-by shootings . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention Dayton , Tennessee-runs by the grace of God . This is Bible Belt country . The defining question is not " What do you do ? " but " What church do you belong to ? " Dayton is the county seat of Rhea ( pronounced RAY ) County , where there are some 130 churches for 28,000 people , from small rural wood frames to the mainstream big brick First Baptist downtown . There 's a lot to give thanks for . First , the setting . Dayton snuggles in the Tennessee River Valley between the Smoky Mountains and the long slow roll of the Cumberland Plateau . Then the salt-of-the-earth people-about 6,000 of them-who work and pray hard . There 's a healthy economy , based on manufacturing plants like La-Z-Boy , which assembles 3,000 recliners a day , and a near-record low unemployment rate of 4.4 percent . Last , but far from least , is the Rhea County High School football team . To bear witness to a victory of the Golden Eagles is the closest thing to heaven on earth . The town itself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central is the Dayton Coffee Shoppe , where biscuits , not bagels , rule . A topping of gravy , while not obligatory , is the local taste . " Brown gravy , not that wallpaper-paste-like white gravy , " one regular explained . Dayton also is the town made famous by the 1925 Scopes " Monkey " trial that matched the flamboyant lawyer William Jennings Bryan against the equally showy Clarence Darrow over whether or not John Scopes , a high school science teacher , had violated House Bill No. 185 , which made it " unlawful . . . to teach ... that man has descended from a lower order of animals . " Scopes , acting as a guinea pig to test the law , lost . Scopes taught at the old county high school , on a hill overlooking the town . The present-day high school is a low brick building that sits in farmland ten miles away . There is an after-school Bible Club and , once upon a time not too long ago , prayers at graduation . When I asked if evolution was part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " We teach-no , we ' present ' - everything in the biology textbook , with a little less emphasis on the controversial parts . " He spoke carefully and would say no more . Evolution was being taught , albeit grudgingly . " The thing that is most difficult for us to accept here is that there are different religious beliefs , " sighed Conner . I asked him about a man , a lawyer , who had recently moved to Dayton from a northern city . When his child reported there were Bible readings in school , he pointed out the violation of federal law , and the school superintendent stopped the readings . An uproar ensued . Rumors flew that the school district was being sued ; citizens suggested starting a legal defense fund . " He did n't understand the community , " Conner said . " Suppose you had taken the man aside beforehand , " I said . " What advice would you have offered ? " Conner , a local , thought awhile . " I would have tried to alert him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , do you want to cause your family trouble ? This is a rural , conservative place , and very emotional about religion . Attack religion and the Crusades begin . But you need to follow your own convictions . " Dayton has endured 75 years of outsider scorn because of Scopes . If it circles the wagons against outsiders , it is not hard to see why . There 's a sense here that people who have not walked in your shoes do n't have a clue . Often , they do n't . On the way to interview Conner , I 'd crossed an elevated walkway linking the gymnasium to the main building . Through the windows you can spot a thread of stream that spills down from the mountain and slips under the walkway . Quotes from people like Alexander Pope and Thomas Edison decorate the walls . They are inspirational , as befits an institution of learning , and there was one I particularly liked . " It takes two to speak the truth , - one to speak , and another to hear .
