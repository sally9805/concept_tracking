B-T PVR BA HR RBI SB S-R 163 .263 18 53 3 // MANAGER GRADY LITTLE second season with Dodgers // AS GENERAL MANAGER Ned Colletti wrapped up negotiations with agent Arn Tellem in November to keep first baseman Nomar Garciaparra in Los Angeles , Tellem told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivated to be a Dodger , lefthanded pitcher Randy Wolf . Colletti was interested but was n't sure he could afford the price tag in a bull market that would bring Gil Meche a five-year , $55 million contract from Kansas City . Soon Tellem let Colletti know just how motivated Wolf was : He 'd take a one-year contract . // " I thought he was probably worth three years , $24 million , maybe two years with an option for the third , " Colletti says . " In this day and age , when do you see a player leave money on the table ? But it told me two very important things about Randy Wolf . Number 1 , he wanted to be a Dodger , and those are the kinds of players we want here . Number 2 , it told me he was convinced he was fully healthy , because if he was n't , he would have been looking for the security of more guaranteed years . " // Wolf ( 69 -- 60 , 4.21 ERA in his career ) took $8 million to pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option for 2008 based on innings pitched -- far less than not only Meche money but also the $40 million that went to Ted Lilly ( 59 -- 58 , 4.60 ) , the $33.8 million to Vicente Padilla ( 66 -- 61 , 4.06 ) and the $24.5 million to Adam Eaton ( 54 -- 45 , 4.40 ) , who replaced Wolf in Philadelphia . // " The bottom line was , this is where I always wanted to be , " says Wolf , who grew up a Dodgers fan in Southern California , twice pitched for his high school city section championship game at Dodger Stadium and starred at Pepperdine . " It 's a dream come true . " // Los Angeles is banking on getting Wolf at the perfect time -- 21 months after Tommy John surgery . He had pitched with pain in his elbow since 2002 and did make 12 pain-free postoperative starts for the Phillies last year ( 4 -- 0 , 5.56 ) . Says Wolf , " I 'm healthy . My arm feels better than it ever felt . It 's like I 'm back in high school . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard as I can . Before , if it took me 20 throws to get loose , that was good . " // Colletti did n't stop with Wolf in his efforts to build the team around starting pitching , the traditional Dodgers ' strength in a pitcher-friendly home ballpark . He also signed ace righthander Jason Schmidt , 34 , who has made at least 29 starts for five years running , to a more market-driven three-year , $47 million deal . The additions fortified Los Angeles with four starters who have been 16-game winners : Derek Lowe , Wolf , Schmidt and Brad Penny . Mix in a power bullpen -- only the Cubs ' pen struck out batters at a better rate last year -- that can use Takashi Saito or Jonathan Broxton to close , and Los Angeles can match any staff in the league . // All that pitching takes pressure off a lineup that last year hit fewer homers than every team in the league except Pittsburgh . The Dodgers won a wild-card spot largely because they drew walks ( third ) , ran the bases well ( second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position ( first ) . They 'll employ the same method this season and have third baseman Andy LaRoche , 23 , first baseman James Loney , 22 , and outfielder Matt Kemp , 22 , on reserve if the offense needs an in-season boost . // Los Angeles is looking for consecutive playoff appearances for the first time since 1995 -- 96 , but the franchise needs to address a more vexing dry spell : It has n't won a playoff series since 1988 , a streak that continued with a three-games-and-out thrashing by the Mets last year . Says Colletti , " There were tears in the clubhouse after that . I ca n't ever recall a team that took the last day so hard . But the message from the players was the same : I ca n't wait for next year . "  - -  T.V. // CONSIDER THIS a modest proposal ... // In his rookie season last year closer Takashi Saito put up a 3.73 ERA against NL West opponents but a microscopic 0.24 mark against teams from other divisions . Why the huge discrepancy ? The 37-year-old Saito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14-year career with the Yokohama BayStars franchise of the Japanese Central League , relies heavily on getting batters to chase a slider that he rarely throws in the strike zone ; it 's a neat trick but one that quickly wears thin the more times opponents face him . Manager Grady Little should consider using hard-throwing 22-year-old Jonathan Broxton ( left ) as his closer against the West , reserving Saito for the rest of a league that does n't see Los Angeles quite as often . After his May 1 call-up last season , Broxton settled into the Dodgers ' setup role and struck out 97 in 76 1/3 innings . // THE LINEUP PROJECTED ROSTER WITH 2006 STATISTICS // // // // * New acquisition B-T : Bats-throws WHIP : Walks plus hits per inning pitched PVR : Player Value Ranking ( explanation on page 77 ) // GO TO my SI SI.com/dodgers Instant access to the latest and best Dodgers stories from across the Web , handpicked by SI 's editors // BEST DODGERS COVERAGE SI.com recommends these media sites ? latimes.com ? dailynews.com ? ocregister.com ? pe.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the best Dodgers info ?

His .333 on-base percentage , however , was second worst among every-day leadoff hitters in the NL , and he made 528 outs -- the fourth consecutive season that Pierre was in the top three in the league in that category .
