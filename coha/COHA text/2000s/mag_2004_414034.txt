Six months earlier , her marriage to Dan Stephens had collapsed , and she was trying to get on with her life in Albuquerque , New Mexico , by making new friends and taking classes in computer animation . But like most women who have suffered a bad breakup , picking up the pieces was n't easy . " I 'm very lonely right now , and I just want someone to talk to and laugh with and love me , " MaryAlice wrote in an e-mail to a friend during a particularly bad moment on April 12 , 2001 .

They dated for just over a month , and then , three months after they met , MaryAlice disappeared . Police suspected foul play , and at first , one focus of their investigation was MaryAlice 's ex-husband , Dan . But soon it became clear that Rick was the culprit . Through their investigation , police discovered that he kidnapped MaryAlice and brutally murdered her . How did a man who was supposed to be nothing more than a harmless Fling turn out to be so dangerous ? Experts say that any woman , no matter how sharp and independent , is more fragile in the aftermath of a breakup . As Sally Caldwell , PhD , author of Romantic Deception and professor of sociology at Texas State University at San Marcos , puts it : " If you have a broken heart , a con man is capable of playing you like a fiddle . " A CHILDHOOD LOSS The youngest of five children in a closeknit family , MaryAlice grew up in Los Lunas , a small town south of Albuquerque . As a student , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joining the high school swim team . She was also pretty , and she once won a local Junior Miss pageant . But her otherwise idyllic childhood was marred by the death of her oldest brother , Christopher , who succumbed to a rare form of cancer at the age of 23 . MaryAlice was only 11 years old at the time , but she and Christopher had always been close , and she 'd even helped care for him through his surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation . Her brothers death inspired her to want to become a doctor , and after graduating from high school , she enrolled in a prestigious seven-year program to earn both her undergraduate and medical school degrees at Brown University . Hut love intruded on her career plans . During her senior year in high school , MaryAlice had started dating Dan Stephens , a school mate who had just graduated . But Dan had joined the marines , and since MaryAlice was college-bound , their relationship waned . While at Brown , MaryAlice struggled with her rigorous premed courses . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she decided to fly to Japan , where Dan was stationed . He missed her too , and they picked up where they had left off . That summer , their relationship deepened , and MaryAlice decided not to return to Brown . In October 1996 , MaryAli , then 20 , and Dan , 20 , married in a small ceremony and settled in Southern California . " We were both so incredibly in love with each other , " says Dan . While Dan worked , MaryAlice trained to become an emergency medical technician . They spent sunny days at Disneyland and swam in the ocean at Newport Beach . TROUBLE IN PARADISE But without discussing his plans with his wife , Dan reenlisted for another four years with the marines . According to her friends , MaryAlice was furious . Soon after , Dan was ordered to sea ( or six months . Despairing over his absence , MaryAlice returned to New Mexico to be with her family . After nearly a year apart , the couple tried to reconnect when Dan returned home , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan now admits . After the separation in October 2000 , MaryAlice was cheerful one day , depressed the next . She dated another high school classmate , but it did n't last . " I know that only you can create your own happiness and all that . . . but it really helps when someone ; is there to kiss you and hold you , " she wrote to her closest friend from college , DeQuincy " Quix " Lezine . TRYING TO HEAL WOUNDS As most women know , one of the easiest ways to get over a past love is to find a replacement . " For some women , the only thing they believe will cure the pain is another man . . . and it could be a relationship at any price , " says Susan Forward , PhD , author of Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them . MaryAlice was n't nearly so desperate , but according to her sister Francine , she was interested in having someone new in her life ; and felt ready and willing to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-and-garden show at the state fairgrounds when they met Rick Clappsy . They both needed cell phones , so they stopped at a sales booth manned by Rick . At first glance , dressed in a suit and tie , standing almost 6 feet tall and weighing 190 pounds , Rick looked " professional , " Francine recalls . Rick laid on the charm , telling Francine , " You should hook me up with your sister , because she 's beautiful . " Looking out for her sister , Francine asked Rick 's boss right then and there if Rick was a good guy , and the boss said yes . Rick swept MaryAlice off her feet , according to Dawn Doty , an Albuquerque friend whom MaryAlice confided in . Rick telephoned constantly , took her out on dates , and was very chivalrous , opening doors for her and describing her as " my queen . " On the surface , he was exactly the kind of guy she was looking for . Two weeks after they met , Rick sent her a poem entitled " Trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say No matter what the world may think Or time might take away ... And believe me when my lips Are trying to express That what I really want from this Is mutual happiness . " Mary Alice 's friends thought Rick might be coming on a little too strong , but she enjoyed the attention . What MaryAlice apparently was n't aware of was Rick 's long history of bad behavior . Raised in New Jersey , Rick joined the army at 18 and soon spent several years in a military prison for larceny and forgery . Then he drifted around the western United States , working for a traveling carnival and collecting an arrest for sexual battery and a citation for shoplifting . In Houston , he was busted for credit-card fraud and spent seven months in the county jail . In early 2001 , right before he met MaryAlice , Rick was accused of raping a New Mexico woman , but police could n't prove the he said-she said case . Friends say that MaryAlice had no clue about any of this , in part because Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meloy PhD , a forensic psychologist in San Diego and author of The Mark of Cain , who specializes in understanding violent criminal behavior , Rick 's profile fits that of a psychopath , an aggressive narcissist who lies to glamorize his own life and ca n't connect emotionally to others . " They are manipulators , " says Meloy . MaryAlice was the perfect prey for someone like Rick . " She was rebounding , she was vulnerable , " says Sergeant Steve Hall , an Albuquerque detective who worked on MaryAlice 's case . " She just had the bad luck to meet this guy . " Within weeks , Rick became more controlling and wanted to know where and with whom MaryAlice spent her time . " There is something about him that I am attracted to , and there are things about him that I ca n't stand , " she wrote in an e-mailmlate May 2001 . Her friend Dawn believes that MaryAlice mistook Ricks possessiveness as a sign that her new boyfriend cared for her . Just a week later , their five-weeklong relationship exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her estranged husband , Dan . Rick flew into a rage and insisted that she cut off all contact with Dan , but MaryAlice refused . Rick ranted that if he could n't have her to himself , then no one could . He even told her that he would kill her in a room full of mirrors , so she could see her ugliness . MaryAlice was in a bind . On one hand , she recognized that Rick was dangerous , so she asked her father to change the locks on her doors and even thought about buying a gun . But Rick also had a bit of a hold over her . She told her friends that she did n't want to go to the police because Rick had claimed that ii she did , he 'd use his " military connections " to get out of jail and track her down . Adding to her misery , by August 2001 , Dan had told MaryAlice that their marriage was definitely over , according to her family . A FAITHFUL PHONE CALL Then , on August 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rick , MaryAlice 's cell phone rang . It was Rick 's roommate . He said that Rick had been diagnosed with lung cancer . Could MaryAlice visit ? It was an effective ploy . MaryAlice was afraid of Rick , but he must have known how the word cancer would affect her . According to MaryAlice 's friend Quix , MaryAlice had almost certainly told Rick about her brothers death . " It was such a central issue in her life , " he says . Notes Sally Caldwell : " Many con men use such personal-tragedy lies to pull at a woman 's heartstrings . It makes a woman drop her guard . " MaryAlice canceled her evening plans , bought a condolence card , and drove to Rick 's apartment . He greeted her , and soon after , the two went to his room and proceeded to have sex . " I think that she felt sorry for him , " says Sergeant Hall . Afterward , Rick made a bizarre request : Would MaryAlice let him demonstrate a law-enforcement technique for his roommate , who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he insisted . Rick put handcuffs on her and forced her to give up her ATM card and PIN . Rick tied a rope around MaryAlice 's neck and slipped a baton into the loop . He slowly twisted the baton and rope , choking her airways , until she stopped breathing . He and his roommate then wrapped MaiyAlice 's tiny body in a blanket and trash bags and left her in a Dumpster outside a nearby Chinese restaurant . Then they withdrew money from her bank account , burglarized her house , sold her clothing to a secondhand store for $86 , and went to the movies . Just 24 hours after the murder , her mother found MaryAlice s house ransacked . Finally , four days after her disappearance , police obtained videotape of the ATM transactions . Rick and his roommate were arrested and confessed to the murder . But it was too late to recover MaryAlice . Authorities searched the local landfill for six weeks , but her body was never found .
