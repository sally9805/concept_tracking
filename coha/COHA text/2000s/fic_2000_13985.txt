He now lives at Gun Hill Road in the Bronx , so beware if you happen to be around that area . He has no regard for human life , including his own . I would like to take his late-model Sport Utility Vehicle and drive it through his front door , accelerate past his bathroom , and come to a violent , crashing halt right on top of his head , but the law prohibits me . Instead , I simply wish that he dies soon and painfully . Whenevah I see him , I say , " I wish you die soon and painfully .

People believe they go through life accumulating things . That is incorrect . People go through life discarding things , tangible and intangible , replaceable and priceless .

Move it out ! p. 21 p. 22 Act 1 , Scene 4 Scene 4 Mary Jane speaks MARY JANE HANRAHAN When I was fifteen , there was this father/daughter dance at the elite private girls ' school in Manhattan that I went to as a charity case-slash-financial aid recipient . My mother had wisely arranged for her brother , Uncle Mikey , to take me to the dance , but at the last minute , my father decided that him not escorting me himself might be one of those things that might scar me in later life  --  so me and my father left our two-family house in Sunnyside that evening ; me in a dress my parents could n't afford , and my dad in his Irish all-purpose navy blue suit with a pair of black socks we had convinced him to borrow from the neighbors . When we got inside the ballroom , I took a quick look around and became instantly embarrassed to the point of humiliation by the fact that my dad was the only father on the Upper East Side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But within an hour , everyone was calling him " Danny , " even the headmistress , who had n't called me anything but " Miss Hanrahan " in three years . And he was dancing , and chatting ; he had even stuck by the agreed-upon two-beer rule , or so I thought At some point in the evening , one of the other fathers made an offhand comment that my father took exception to ; a heated discussion ensued , and my father ended up stabbing the guy with a dessert fork , breaking the skin . What the guy had said was unimportant ; actually , what he said was , he was reminiscing about where he had grown up as a kid and he remarked that " It used to be a good neighborhood , you know , white , now , forget it , I went back there last month , it 's half white , the rest : blacks and Italians . " My mom 's Italian . EMS was called , and the dance ? Well , let 's just say the stabbing concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the assault , after explaining how he did n't immediately attack him , and how he had given the " rich jerk " ample opportunity to apologize , and how he wo n't tolerate a bigot no matter where he is , and " What if your mom or ' Rasheed from the Deli ' had been there ? " and how he still does n't understand why I need to go to that stuck-up school anyway . In the end , what he finally said was " It was just a fork . " And he said it , I 've now come to realize , with just that same look of incredulousness on his face that Angel Cruz had on his as if the whole world was crazy and he was the only sane one . I hated my dad for the whole mortifying incident , but the dysfunctional side of me was proud of him  --  actually I 'm still kind of proud of him  --  and I 'm not convinced that there 's something wrong with me for feeling that . I had no idea why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I felt something  --  something  --  and I needed to know what it was . And even though I was no longer obligated to him as his counsel , and despite the fact that the rational side of my brain was very much convinced that he had , in fact , attempted to murder Reverend Kim , and , yes , of course , even if he had n't literally attempted murder , you still ca n't run around shooting people just like you ca n't go around stabbing people with dessert forks , I know all that , but I got ta admit that somewhere inside of me , and I do n't know if it 's the good side , or the side that I saw a therapist twice a week and went to ACOA meetings for , but somewhere inside of me is a place that believes that sometimes you can do those things , or at least , somebody can , or should , and that one man 's neurotic is another man 's hero , and who , ultimately , can say which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 p. 24 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene 5 The yard .

Were you ready to do it , but then you got scared and aimed low , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his damn ass and hit it . Mothahfuckah got an ass like a water buffalo , it ai n't hard to locate ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN But you wanted to kill him  --  ANGEL CRUZ I wanted to shoot him in the fuckin ' ass , lady ! How many times I got ta say it ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN Why ? ANGEL CRUZ It was something I could do , ah-right ? ! These mothahfuckahs , like Reverend Kim , they run around , talkin ' shit , talkin ' " God , " and they steal people ! Steal mothahfuckahs right out from your face . And what can you do about it ? Nothin ' ! You go to The Law , you know what the law do ? The law do fuckin ' nothin ' , that 's what the law do ! You try to go to a outside agency , make a complaint : " They stole my friend , " you know who you talkin ' to ? You talkin ' to the same mothahfuckahs who stole him in the first place ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awareness Network ! p. 33 MARY JANE HANRAHAN Scientologists ? ANGEL CRUZ Read the fuckin ' paper , lady ! Scientologists sued the Cult Awareness Network , bankrupted them , and took over the damn Cult Awareness Network ! Same office ! Same phone number !

MARY JANE HANRAHAN So you went out , you got a gun  --  ANGEL CRUZ C'm on now ! They did n't steal my friend yesterday ! I did n't juss smoke a vile a crack , and bum-rush the show " guns a blazin ' " ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN But you were high ! ANGEL CRUZ Look , I seen a seventy-five-year-old grandmother from Astoria get sent to penitentiary for trying kidnap her grand-daughter from Reverend Kim 's church ! I kidnapped my friend Joey myself ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN When ? ANGEL CRUZ Two months ago ! Two years in the makin ' ! Surveillance , kidnappers , fuckin ' deprogrammer  --  you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANGEL CRUZ Dass a expensive mothahfuckah : expensive and useless . MARY JANE HANRAHAN It did n't work out . p. 34 ANGEL CRUZ Deprogrammer said Joey had an unusually strong faith , some bullshit  --  did n't stop him from cashin ' the check ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN And you did this all yourself ? ANGEL CRUZ Nah , but , it 's amazin ' how people act . One day they all , like , " Yeah , bro ' , whatever ya need , " next day it 's , " Yo , fuck that niggah , B , got better things to do . " People , they forget . MARY JANE HANRAHAN But not you . ANGEL CRUZ Dass my friend ! If someone 's your friend , like , a real friend , how you supposed ta juss forget about him ? You got any friends , lady ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN Mary Jane  --  ANGEL CRUZ You got any friends , " Mary Jane " ? ' Cuz we got a friend , Eustace , he 's doin ' life in Arizona , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven . And we got this other friend , Crazy Legs , he died a cancer at twenty-two , and dass hard , but at least he 's dead ! At least we could account for him , ya know ? We 'd go to the park , Grant 's Tomb , smoke a joint , we 'd save the last hit for Crazy Legs , put the roach to the side . But Joey ? He juss gone . Bang : out ! It 'd be one thing if he was out for some good reason , like if he was an astronaut in space chasin ' the cure for AIDS , but what he out for ? He out for bullshit ! He out ' cuz Reverend Kim sold him a straight-up lie  --  p. 35 MARY JANE HANRAHAN According to you  --  ANGEL CRUZ According to me ? ! Do you know what Reverend Kim say ? He say he 's the Son of God ! I mean , how big does your fuckin ' balls have to be to sit there with a straight face and claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if there was a Son of God  --  which , I mean , get real  --  but MARY JANE HANRAHAN You do n't believe in God ? ANGEL CRUZ Ah-right , I 'm a put it like this : If there was " another " Son of God runnin ' around here , juss pickin ' up where his older brother left off , tryin ' ta save our ass , He sure as shit ai n't Reverend Kim ! How many Sons of God you know drive a Lexus ? Or got million-dollar stock portfolios ? Or go skiing in Aspen ? ' Cuz I 'll tell you right now : If Jesus Christ existed , and I ai n't sayin ' he did , but if , by some miracle he actually did , the mothahfuckah did n't ski ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN Not in Israel he did n't  --  ANGEL CRUZ Not in Israel , not nowhere ! Swear ta God , I ca n't understan ' why Joey do n't see that ! Dumb-ass mothahfuckah ! It 's so obvious , so clear , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the know what I 'm sayin ' ?  --  the , the irony ? The irony is this : Me and Joey , we got , like , the telepathy . He always know what I 'm thinkin ' and vice versa the other way . I know what girl he like before he know it ! He know what I 'm gon na say , it ai n't even come out my mouth yet ! People think I 'm crazy to have got involved in this shit the way I have , two years of my life and all that , maybe a lot more now , but , for real : If the situations was reversed , and it was me in that cult , no doubt in my mind Joey woulda done the same thing for me , only he prolly woulda did it better . He would n't a forgotten about me  --  p. 36 MARY JANE HANRAHAN How about now ? ANGEL CRUZ " How ' bout now " what ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN Where 's your friend Joey now ? You 're in jail ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a  --  MARY JANE HANRAHAN Because of what ? ! ANGEL CRUZ He he captured ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN He 's not captured , you 're captured ! You been here  --  what ?  --  Three days ? ANGEL CRUZ Maybe he do n't know I 'm here  --  MARY JANE HANRAHAN What ? He does n't read the papers ? ANGEL CRUZ I do n't know what he reads  --  MARY JANE HANRAHAN Did it ever occur to you , Angel , that we , as individual people , are responsible for the individual choices that we make ? And regardless of how close we may think we are to someone else , we have very little control over their choices , and absolutely zero responsibility for the consequences those choices bring on them ? ANGEL CRUZ Zero ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN That 's right , zero ! ANGEL CRUZ Maybe for you  --  p. 37 MARY JANE HANRAHAN No ! Not just for me , for everybody ! If somebody joins some stupid cult , whether they 're a good person or not , whether I love them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or think they 've been manipulated , or abused , there 's nothing I can do about it ! Nothing ! And it does n't matter if that person is a total stranger or my sister ; they are n't going to leave unless they want to , no matter what I think or feel ! ANGEL CRUZ Dass bullshit  --  MARY JANE HANRAHAN My father was still smoking cigarettes while he was in an oxygen tent ! I begged him to quit all my life  --  did it stop him from killing himself ? ANGEL CRUZ Maybe you shoulda tried harder ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN Harder than what ? ANGEL CRUZ Or maybe you did n't really give enough of a fuck to really try to help him ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN Should I have gone to the chairman of Philip Morris and shot him in the ass ? Would that have helped him ? ANGEL CRUZ Maybe you should ax yourself that question ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN That 's ridiculous . ANGEL CRUZ Is it ? My friend Joey should be doing what you 're doing ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helpin ' the people , fuckin ' whatever ! But where is he ? He 's out ! Gone ! And why ? Why is he not here ? Why ? Do you believe that Reverend Kim is the actual Son of God ? That a man deported from his own country and convicted of tax evasion in this one could even speak for God , let alone be God ? That a man who steals people , has them selling flowers on the street , gettin ' rich off them , what the fuck ? Look me in my eye and tell me that a man like that should be allowed to do what he 's doing ! With a fuckin ' government-approved tax-exempt status and a full police escort ! p. 38 MARY JANE HANRAHAN Angel  --  ANGEL CRUZ Where 's my mother 's full police escort when she gets off the subway from work after midnight and has to walk home alone ? Where 's Mother Teresa 's Lexus ? And how ' bout you ? You a public defender , and if you 're any good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more money working someplace else , right ? But you do n't do that , do you ? So where 's your mansion ? Where 's your frappacino , swimming pool , mistress , Son-a-God fuckin ' wonderland ? ! He stole my friend . I shot him in the ass . Now I 'm fucked in jail , and he 's eating banana cream pie in some plush hospital bed reading his Wall Street Journal ! Juss like the chairman of Philip Morris ! Your pops , he six feet under , fuckin ' maggot food now , where 's the chairman ? I 'll tell you where the fuckin ' chairman is ! Out there on the eighteenth green sippin ' a Heineken , wiping the crumbs from his shrimp-salad sandwich off of his cashmere sweater , and he 's smiling , unaffected . Or am I just being " ridiculous " ? ( Pause ) MARY JANE HANRAHAN Everything you 're telling me , Angel , it sounds like a real good motive to wan na murder somebody . ANGEL CRUZ My question to you was : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scene 7 Scene 7 The yard , protective custody . A month later . Mary Jane speaks as Lucius Jenkins and Angel Cruz are being led into their cages . MARY JANE HANRAHAN I had to concede that what Angel was saying was not ridiculous . What was ridiculous was the fact that I regularly earned acquittals for hardened career criminals : crack dealers , arsonists , murderers even  --  people with jaw-dropping rap sheets  --  and then , six months later I 'd be asking bail for the same guy for the same offense or worse ! Angel was n't a recidivist felon , he was a civilian . I believed I could get Angel an acquittal without having to put him on the stand . I believed that the jury , if led , would n't convict Angel despite all the evidence . I could have plea-bargained Angel 's case ; that would have been easy , routine  --  most of those young district attorneys feared me because I was that rare public defender who could ruin them by taking an open-and-shut case to trial and win anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent attorney ! I would n't plea-bargain Angel 's case because right after our second meeting , he went back upstairs and was assaulted by two other inmates  --  beaten and raped . I would n't plea-bargain Angel 's case because three days later , when the Associated Press reported that Reverend Kim had been rushed back to surgery and that he had died on the operating table , Angel was found unconscious in his cell the next morning with a bedsheet tied around his neck . I would n't plea bargain Angel 's case because after Angel spent the next seventy-two hours in a prison psych ward and before being transferred to a special twenty-three-hour lockdown wing of Protective Custody , I sat Angel down and informed him that the D.A . had filed for first-degree felony murder and that the charge carried a mandatory sentence of " Life without the Possibility . " And Angel looked at me , and said , " Without the possibility of what ? " ( VALDEZ reenters , leading ANGEL to his cage. ) p. 40 VALDEZ But if you do decide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world where mere misery is like toasting marshmallows ' round the campfire in your long johns .

" Nuthin ' Not a damn thing . Kept waitin ' for the sirens , they never came So I called up the pizza shop , toal ' em ; " I never got my pizza . " You know what they did ? They sent me another one . For free . Now , to me that 's a peculiar turn of events , doncha think ? Unnatural I 'll tell ya why I killed him .

VALDEZ ( From his post ) I heard that ! LUCIUS JENKINS Wit ' all due respect , Valdez , if it 's a infraction to breathe God 's air , juss tell us now and we 'll asphyxiate ourselves . ANGEL CRUZ Yo , doan start no shit  --  LUCIUS JENKINS That man ai n't nuttin ' but a apparition ! ( For VALDEZ ) An ' we gon na conversate about whatever strikes our damn amusement , believe that !

( Miming being on the phone ) Hey , Valdez ! My lawyer 's on the phone , it 's for you ! Ha ! Want me ta tell him you in the shower soapin ' up your privates ? Ah , what 's a matter , brother : Constitution got your tongue ? Ha ! ( phone ) " Now what 's that , Mr. Cooperstein ? Yes , sir , I 'll be sure to tell him . No , no , quite all right . You have a nice day too , Mr. C. " Hey , Valdez !

ANGEL CRUZ I uh  --  yo , this ai n't got nuthin ' to do wit ' me . LUCIUS JENKINS It okay , son , tell the man . ANGEL CRUZ Look  --  VALDEZ It 's a simple question , Droopy Dog . ANGEL CRUZ I ai n't fuckin ' Droopy Dog ! VALDEZ Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANGEL CRUZ Dass my business . VALDEZ It 's funny . Some people , they got big balls when they 're high on narcotics , brandishing weapons , killing a man , but take away the drugs and the guns , ask them a simple question , and what happens ? They revert back to what they really are , ai n't that right , Droopy Dog ? p. 52 LUCIUS JENKINS Someone need ta give you a hug , Valdez . VALDEZ If there 's a God , Superstar , you ai n't never gon na meet him ! Very soon , Mr. Superstar , very soon , you gon na be Flyin ' the Friendly Skies .

You are a defect of evolution like a three-legged dog , and when you get to Florida , they gon na put you down ! LUCIUS JENKINS That makes ya happy , do n't it ? VALDEZ Happy ? Why should I be happy ? They gon na feed you lobster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's happy about that ? No . What makes me happy is lookin ' at you right now and seeing the sheer terror in your eyes . Because that terror will haunt you every day until the State of Florida relieves it with a lethal injection ! And that terror , along with whatever misery I can provide , is the only justice that the families of your victims are ever gon na get ! LUCIUS JENKINS I 'm a pray for you , man . VALDEZ Then pray . Me ? I 'm feeling a bit parched ; I think I need a beverage . And being a free man , I think I 'll run down to the staff cafeteria and choose from a wide assortment of refreshing drinks . Perhaps I 'll purchase a Kit-Kat and a Bear Claw , something to tide me over , till I leave here and go eat whatever I want for dinner . p. 53 LUCIUS JENKINS Hope you 're monitoring your cholesterol  --  VALDEZ What ? LUCIUS JENKINS Would n't want ya ta drop dead before you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man because I choose to be ! End of story ! Not because I fear God . Not because I wan na go to some Holy Playground when I kick the bucket ! I go to work , I pay my taxes , I observe the law . I did n't kill eight people ! I do n't need to be " saved " ! Do you really believe that there 's a thing called God ? Or is it that your pain is so unbearable that you force yourself to create a belief in order to medicate that pain ? And if there is a God , Superstar , do you honestly believe that you are free from the burden of what you 've done ? And if there is n't a God , then what are you really ? ' Cuz in a meaningless existence , your only function was to be a source of pain and death , like cancer or a plane crash ! You renounced your humanity when you claimed your first victim ! Now what are you ? I think you know , Superstar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know !

LUCIUS JENKINS Bible say  --  ANGEL CRUZ Fuck the Bible ! Bible ai n't no autobiography , man ! " God " did n't write the shit ! Buncha mothahfuckahs wrote that shit . Apostles did n't write no Gospel , and Jesus , that mothahfuckah never wrote one damn word ! Not even a fuckin ' postcard ! Dass a fact ! Ai n't my fault the man died , but he dead now , so what ? He juss one man outta a billion , people die every day . LUCIUS JENKINS Ai n't murdered every day . ANGEL CRUZ Nah , they got ta run into you first to earn dat distinction . LUCIUS JENKINS Or you ! ANGEL CRUZ I did somethin ' had to be done ! LUCIUS JENKINS Then accept it ! You man enough to do it , then be man enough ta stand behind it ! But you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong ! You know it ! p. 67 ANGEL CRUZ Do you know it 's wrong ta kill a man ? LUCIUS JENKINS ' Course I do . ANGEL CRUZ Then why you got lawyers fightin ' extradition for you ? LUCIUS JENKINS I 'm gon na do life here in New York State anyway ! I pled guilty . I took responsibility ! Why I got ta go to a place where they tryin ' to kill me ? ANGEL CRUZ I thought you was straight wit ' God , man ? LUCIUS JENKINS I am . ANGEL CRUZ If you straight , then why you got ta fear death , mothahfuckah ?

ANGEL CRUZ I know , he killed eight people , right ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN Eight that we know of ! ANGEL CRUZ He told me eight . MARY JANE HANRAHAN He told you eight ? What does that mean ? ! " Case closed , Lucius told Angel eight " ? And what , eight 's not enough for you ? ANGEL CRUZ I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ta business . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Maybe Lucius should be your lawyer ! ANGEL CRUZ Yo , I was juss makin ' conversation ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN When you 're acquitted , Angel , when we 're sitting in a bar together drinking beer and eating chicken wings , then make conversation ! Unless you wan na just have a conversation now , exchange recipes , talk philosophy , forget the whole thing ! ANGEL CRUZ You tryin ' ta back out now ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN Are you ? ANGEL CRUZ Yo , I 'm here , Mary Jane . MARY JANE HANRAHAN I am putting my career on the line for you , Angel , my vocation ! So you better be damn sure your head 's screwed back on before I even think about putting you on that witness stand and suborning perjury ! p. 71 ANGEL CRUZ I 'm down wit ' the program and I 'm gon na thank you till my dyin ' day , believe me .

ANGEL CRUZ ' Cuz I might say some shit I should n't say . MARY JANE HANRAHAN What if it needs to be said ? ANGEL CRUZ I do n't know  --  MARY JANE HANRAHAN Do you wan na spend the rest of your life in prison ? ! p. 72 ANGEL CRUZ Whadda you think ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN I do n't know , Angel !

I invented the shit ! MARY JANE HANRAHAN Do you know how electricity works ? ANGEL CRUZ Not exactly . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Then that 's a dumb lie ! Tell me a smart lie . ANGEL CRUZ Like what ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN My father drank Jameson 's . ANGEL CRUZ Dass a lie ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN He drank Bushmills . But it 's a smart lie because my father was a first-generation Irish Catholic who supported the I.R.A. , and Bushmills is known as a Protestant whiskey because it comes from the North . So it would be logical to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey , even though he did . That 's a lie built on truth . That 's why it 's a good lie . Because it 's true . Now tell me a true lie , Angel . p. 74 ANGEL CRUZ Ah-aight I tried ta kill Reverend Kim that night . MARY JANE HANRAHAN What ? ANGEL CRUZ I mean , it 's a lie ' cuz I did n't try ta kill him , but it 's true ' cuz MARY JANE HANRAHAN Because what ? ANGEL CRUZ It 's true ' cuz ' cuz it kinda makes sense that I might have wanted to , right ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN I 'm the D.A. , you 're you : " Did you shoot Reverend Kim ? " ANGEL CRUZ No . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Look me in the eye when you say it . " Did you shoot him ? " ANGEL CRUZ No . MARY JANE HANRAHAN You 're lying ! ANGEL CRUZ Whaddya want me to do , say yes ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN I want you to believe what you 're saying . ANGEL CRUZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it true ! " Did you shoot him ? " ANGEL CRUZ No . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Why can you say that ? ANGEL CRUZ I do n't know . p. 75 MARY JANE HANRAHAN Think about it . ANGEL CRUZ ' Cuz I ai n't like that ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN Why not ? ANGEL CRUZ It ai n't in me . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Why not ? ANGEL CRUZ I 'm not , you know  --  MARY JANE HANRAHAN No I do n't . You 're not what ? ANGEL CRUZ I 'm like , guns scare me . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Guns scare everyone . ANGEL CRUZ Nah , I mean , like , holding one . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Why 's that ? ANGEL CRUZ ' Cuz a somethin ' that happened once  --  MARY JANE HANRAHAN So it would make sense to you that you would never hold a gun again ? ANGEL CRUZ Yeah . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Okay . " Did you bring a gun to the church that night ? " ANGEL CRUZ Nah . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Say no . ANGEL CRUZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it make sense to you that you would n't shoot Reverend Kim ? p. 76 ANGEL CRUZ ' Cuz it 's wrong ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN What 's wrong ? ANGEL CRUZ Shootin ' someone . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Fair enough . " Did you shoot Reverend Kim ? " ANGEL CRUZ No . MARY JANE HANRAHAN " You shot him , did n't you ? " ANGEL CRUZ No . MARY JANE HANRAHAN " Did you ever think about hurting Reverend Kim ? " ANGEL CRUZ No . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Say yes to that . ANGEL CRUZ Why ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN Because you only have to lie twice : when he asks you if you had a gun on you , and when he asks you if you shot Kim . Everything else , tell the truth . ANGEL CRUZ It wo n't make me look bad ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN It will make you look truthful . The jury wants to acquit you , Angel . They just need to hear you say sincerely and believably that you did n't do it , and they will clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY JANE HANRAHAN It 's called jury annulment . Even if it was totally obvious that you did it , the jury can refuse to convict , and that 's it . End of story . p. 77 ANGEL CRUZ And no one can say shit ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN No one . ANGEL CRUZ Even though it 's wrong ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN You think what you did is wrong ? ANGEL CRUZ You mean , technically ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN Last month you did n't think you did anything wrong ! ANGEL CRUZ I ai n't sayin ' it 's wrong , but , technically , the truth is : I shot him , right ? Technically , thass kinda wrong , is n't it ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN What are you saying , Angel ? ANGEL CRUZ I mean , what do you think about it ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN It does n't matter what I think . ANGEL CRUZ What if I said that it mattered to me ? MARY JANE HANRAHAN Do you wan na stop the trial , plead guilty ? ANGEL CRUZ I wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury , Angel , they want to acquit you because it 's right , not because it 's wrong . They do n't think you deserve " Life " or anything close to it . No one blames you for Reverend Kim 's death except the State of New York ! And what is that ? It 's an institution ! It 's a set of rules set up to apply to each and every circumstance , as if they 're all the same . They are not all the same . The jury knows that . And they will clear you of all charges , from murder on down , because they understand what happened here beyond the " technicalities " and they empathize . Not because of your dazzling smile , but because , under the same circumstances as you , they might have done the same damn thing themselves . You made a statement , Angel . And they are going to back that statement up . Your testimony will supply reasonable doubt . And that 's all they want . And that 's what I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JANE HANRAHAN Does it make sense to you ? ANGEL CRUZ Oh Yeah Yeah . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Are you sure ? ANGEL CRUZ I was juss  --  MARY JANE HANRAHAN Just what ? ANGEL CRUZ Thinking . MARY JANE HANRAHAN About what ? ANGEL CRUZ Joey . MARY JANE HANRAHAN Oh . ANGEL CRUZ We useta , me and Joey , we useta sneak out our house on Sunday nights , jump the turnstiles . And we would hop down onto the subway tracks , walk through the tunnels , lookin ' for shit , makin ' adventures , playin ' like we was G.I. Joes Pick up a empty can a Hawaiian Punch or some ol ' beer bottle for fake walkie-talkies , and we 'd have our snow boots on so we could be astronauts . And we would pretend we were the last two survivors on earth and that we came from the future stupid the future like in that Planet of the Apes movie with the two guys ? Only we had no weapons , juss chocolate milk . And we 'd get so lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many stories : lookin ' for ghosts , lookin ' for apes , lookin ' for fortunes , runnin ' from rats , talkin ' ' bout girls , talkin ' ' bout Thelma from Good Times , talkin ' ' bout daydreams , talkin ' ' bout Bruce Lee versus Evel Knievel , talkin ' in words that was n't even words and and it would always surprise us when we saw the lights even though we could feel the train coming , but it was the lights . The closer those lights came , rumble of the tracks , sound a the conductor 's horn blarin ' at us , we 'd get so excited we 'd freeze  --  two seconds of freezin ' cold hypnotized holdin ' hands , waitin ' , waitin ' , then : Bang ! We 'd jump off the rails , hug the wall , climb back up the platform , start runnin '  --  runnin '  --  tearin ' ass clear across town back to Riverside or Cherry Park .

We did n't move for a long time . We was cryin ' , and Joey ripped his brother 's coat We was n't speakin ' till we got to our block and Joey said that it was the light that ripped us apart and saved our lives Joey said , " Jesus hopped the A train to see us safe to bed .

ANGEL CRUZ Chicken wings and beer . p. 81 Act 2 , Scene 3 Scene 3 Charlie D'Amico speaks . CHARLIE D'AMICO Lucius Jenkins was executed by the state of Florida on June third Me and the wife , Mary , we took a plane down to Tallahassee to be there for Lou since he did n't really have nobody except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of somethin ' or other . I did n't get to talk to Lou or nothin ' , we were just permitted to witness the death It was quick . The thing that freaked me out the most was they had this clock on the wall in the room where Lucius was . It was hangin ' right above the hospital gurney and it said " Standard " on it , juss like the clocks we had at Rikers . I kept starin ' at that clock and at the little red hand goin ' around marking the minutes and the big black hand clickin ' them off . I felt like I could hear it clickin ' through the Plexiglas . I kept thinkin ' how I 'd stare at that same clock at work wanting it to move faster , and now here I was in Florida wishin ' it could move slower or just stop . I hated that clock mostly ' cuz I felt it was fuckin ' redundant When they brought Lou in , he was silent . He did n't ever say nuthin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was : They asked him if he had a final statement to make and he said , " No , sir . " He only looked out at us once . He looked right at me and I tried ta smile but it was like he did n't recognize me , and for like a split second I was pissed ; I was thinkin ' , " This trip cost us like a thousand bucks , at least he could acknowledge our fuckin ' presence , ya know ? " It 's crazy , but that 's really what I thought . My wife , Mary , had just the right expression on her face though , and she cried real real quietly , so as not to upset the families or take away from the thing that was happenin ' right in front of us I tried real hard to figure out what he was feelin ' or thinkin ' , but it was real hard to tell from lookin ' at him . It almost looked as if he was n't feelin ' nuthin ' ; and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really be the case , but I was wrong . It turns out Lucius must of found himself another Oreo cookie man , ' cuz when the coroner did a toxicology on him , they found substantial traces of heroin and cocaine in the bloodstream . Lucius died high as a kite . When it was over , me and Mary went to this diner across the street from our motel that advertised itself as having " Tallahassee 's Finest Southern Fried Chicken . " We ordered two plates , and when the waitress brought it over , we got all excited ' cuz it looked so big and juicy and plump , but when I stuck my fork into this big plump fried chicken , it deflated like a balloon . We got the check , went back to the motel , ordered a pizza from Domino 's , called my sister-in-law so we could talk to the kids . When we got off the phone , Mary kissed me  --  like she really meant it . I kissed her back , and we went to bed and made love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizza guy came , we pretended we were n't there I could tell you that Lucius Jenkins helped me stop drinkin ' , ' cuz he did , that he convinced me to look into startin ' a pool-cleaning business wit ' my brother-in-law , which we also did , and that he got me fired off my job which turned out to be a huge blessin ' in disguise ; and that stuff is all important and true , but really , I only knew the guy for three months , which ai n't a lot , and if someone were ta say that he just used me or whatever , that he was a lunatic , I prolly could n't argue back much . Ask me about drinkin ' and jails , I 'll tell ya a lot . Ask me about pool cleanin ' , I 'll take my chances against anybody . Ask me about Lucius Jenkins , there ai n't a hell of a lot I can say ' cuz there ai n't a hell of a lot I know .

Angel 's redirect had been masterfully constructed , and he was masterful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the eye , and most of all , he looked and sounded completely sympathetic and believable . I got emotional . I tried not to show it , but it just spilled out . I was proud of him . I was prouder of myself . And why not ? It was my defining moment and I held on to it a split second too long . Angel started sobbing , and I was vaguely thinking , " Okay , get him off the stand , " but before I could react , because the truth is I really was getting off on how emotionally involved the jury was getting over all this , before I knew what was happening , Angel started talking . He told the judge not to blame me , that I was just trying to help . I tried to cut him off ; I said , " No more questions , " but Angel kept on talking ANGEL CRUZ " Hail Mary  --  p. 98 MARY JANE HANRAHAN And talking ANGEL CRUZ " Hail Mary  --  MARY JANE HANRAHAN Angel will be eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a lady , talk to your fuckin ' Son .
