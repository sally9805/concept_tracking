Opponents of abortion insist that the Supreme Court usurped the sovereign power of the people . // THE BUSES IN DUBLIN these days are displaying advertisements from the pro-life movement demanding a new constitutional referendum on abortion . The Taoiseach ( prime minister ) , Bertie Ahern , has promised to meet that demand , but short of a political crisis that would force his hand , the odds in favor of his doing so are not great . The truth is : Irish politicians are scared of the politics of abortion . The Republic has already had two very divisive abortion referenda ( 1983 and 1992 ) , as well as a landmark Supreme Court decision ( 1992 ) that had clear parallels with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade . With two other constitutional referenda scheduled for later this year-one to ratify the Nice Treaty of the European Union , the other to allow for the establishment of a Judicial Council-the opportunity is undoubtedly at hand to include abortion in the package . The government 's public commitment to do this still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . With the Celtic Tiger economy doing exceptionally well and the Good Friday peace agreement holding in Northern Ireland , the Taoiseach has repeatedly said that his government ( a coalition of Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats ) will run its full five-year term ( up to June 2002 ) . An untimely move on abortion could derail things . But the government is dependent for a voting majority in Dail Eireann ( parliament ) on the support of four independents ; and while all four are in broad agreement with government policies , they have also stated that they back the demands for another referendum on abortion . Whether there will be one before the next election is now anyone 's guess . What is clear is that , sooner or later , this or some other government must address the messy situation left in the aftermath of that 1992 Supreme Court ruling in the so-called X Case . That ruling proved as contentious in the Irish context as Roe v. Wade was in the United States . And it also raised a host of similar concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public policy on such a deeply felt issue as abortion . It is n't just that many people in Ireland believe the Supreme Court got it wrong in 1992 . The debate also reflects concern about where the power to determine public policy on such a crucial issue as abortion ( literally , a life or death matter ) should lie . Should it lie with the courts , with parliament or with the people ? That , almost as much as the pros and cons of the morality of abortion itself , is agitating many citizens . The practice of testing legislation against the provisions of the Republic 's 1937 Constitution had given rise by the 1980 's to a belief that the courts were usurping the powers of parliament . And in Ireland today-just as in the United States-the view has taken hold in some quarters that the judiciary has become too " political . " The persistence of this view is particularly pronounced among those opposed to abortion . They are very aggrieved about the X Case , a ruling , they believe , that thwarted and overturned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referendum on abortion in 1983 . Consequently , the campaign for another referendum has been motivated in part by a distrust of the judiciary and a desire to ensure that the final say , the definitive verdict on abortion should not rest with the courts . Facets of the X Case ( Attorney General v. X ) may evoke for some American readers memories of the Sherri Finkbain controversy in 1962 , when a 29-year-old mother of four from Phoenix , Ariz. , had to travel to Sweden for an abortion . The Irish controversy involved a 14-year-old girl , known as X , who became pregnant as a result of rape . Both she and her parents decided to travel to Britain for an abortion . While there , an injunction was secured by the attorney general , and on learning of the injunction the family returned to Ireland . The injunction was appealed to the Supreme Court . A majority of the court held that if there was a real and substantial risk to the life , as distinct from the health , of the mother , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then abortion was lawful . Evidence was given that the girl was suicidal as a result of the rape and the pregnancy , and the court agreed that this constituted a " real and substantial risk " to her life . However , the court also found that if there was no such threat to her life , the constitutional right to travel could be restrained if the trip were for the purpose of obtaining an abortion . This judgment , together with an earlier decision by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg , gave rise to three further constitutional amendments . The three were put to the electorate in one package later in 1992 . One proposal sought to remove any limit on the right to travel ; the second sought to remove any ban on the right to information about abortion services abroad , and the third-dealing with the " substantive " issue-sought to rule out the risk of suicide as grounds for abortion . The travel and information amendments were passed ; but the one dealing with the " substantive " issue was defeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a situation where a pregnant woman or girl , if suicidal as a result of her pregnancy , is not only free to travel abroad for an abortion , but can also legally seek one in the Republic . However , the practical reality is that there is no legal abortion available in Ireland because it is prohibited by the Irish Medical Council 's ethical guidelines . The state , of course , acting on the Supreme Court ruling in the X Case , could legislate to give practical effect to this ruling , but successive governments have steadfastly refused to do so , their assumption being that this would prove highly divisive . Instead , the Toaiseach promised during the 1997 general election campaign that , if returned to office , he favored putting the issue to the people again in a new referendum . Shortly after the Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats Coalition was formed ( June 1997 ) , Mr. Ahern announced a Green Paper . When it appeared in September 1999 , it outlined seven options : 1 . an absolute constitutional ban on abortion ; 2. an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of suicide ( restrict the application of the X Case ) as grounds for permitting abortion ; 3. the retention of the status quo ; 4. the retention of the constitutional status quo with legislative restatement of the prohibition on abortion ; 5. legislation to regulate abortion only in circumstances defined in the X Case ; 6. a reversion to the position as it obtained prior to 1983 ; 7. permission for abortion on grounds beyond those specified in the X Case . The Green Paper was referred to an all-party committee on the Constitution in September 1999 . A year later that committee recommended the setting up of an agency to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies , but was silent on the seven options . It did recognize that a major problem facing Ireland was the large number of crisis pregnancies that result in recourse to abortion facilities in Britain . Since the passing of the British Abortion Act of 1967 , over 100,000 women giving an address in Ireland have had abortions there . That is the official figure , but it is widely believed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion was illegal in Ireland under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act . In the early 1980 's , after fears had been voiced that Ireland 's membership in the European Union might lead to the imposition of abortion legislation , a vigorous campaign began for a constitutional prohibition on abortion , irrespective of circumstances . In 1983 a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition , headed by Dr. Garret Fitzgerald , put an anti-abortion amendment before the people . It said : " The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and , with due regard to the equal right of the mother , guarantees in its laws to respect and , as far as practicable , by its laws to defend that right . " The amendment was carried by a 2-to- I majority . With this in place , it was generally believed that there was now a watertight constitutional guarantee against the introduction of abortion in Ireland . Then , in 1992 , came the X Case . The unthinkable-or what a majority of the people since 1983 regarded as unthinkable-had happened : abortion was now legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? The opponents of abortion insisted that the Supreme Court overreached itself , usurping the sovereign power of the people . The decision in the X Case , they claimed , was an abuse of judicial power . Earlier this year , a new anti-abortion group , the Mother and Child Campaign , was launched in Dublin , and its-leaders insisted abortion was not necessary in any circumstances . At the same time , a rival group , Abortion Reform , stated that an " absolutist ban on abortion in Ireland " was neither feasible nor desirable . The only common ground between the two sides is that the situation created by the X Case is deeply unsatisfactory For one side , it goes too far ; for the other side , it is of no practical use unless and until the court 's adjudication is given legislative force . For the politicians on all sides this has created a dilemma . They are aware that the X Case ruling ( described by an editorial in the Irish Catholic newspaper as an " infamous decision " ) has alarmed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , has saddened and disappointed the Catholic hierarchy . The latter have called for a new constitutional amendment that would once more prohibit direct and intentional abortion . The decision rests with the government . But who should really have the final say on abortion-unelected and unaccountable judges or the people 's representatives in parliament ? It is a question that is sure to surface as the debate on abortion heats up once again in the Irish Republic . Author Affiliation T. P.

Whole grains , with their heart disease-fighting properties and the combined synergistic health effects of their phytochemicals and nutrients , can provide powerful protection from modern diseases and even help people stay slim . Although whole grains such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are not all created equal . Recently , a handful of researchers around the world have been studying one of the lesser known but potentially most beneficial of all whole grains , the white-seed variety of the Salvia hispanica plant . <p> Once a favorite food of the ancient Aztecs who believed it increased their stamina , Salvia hispanica ranks among the richest of grains in omega-3s , dietary fiber , calcium , iron , and antioxidants . <p> " This grain 's nutrient composition seems phenomenal , " says Dr. Vladimir Vuksan , director of the Risk Factor Modification Centre at Toronto 's St. Michael 's Hospital . " Its health benefits are becoming more and more apparent with emerging scientific evidence . " <p> In the first major study of Salvia hispanica , Dr. Vuksan and his University of Toronto colleagues baked the mild-flavored grain into white bread and assessed its effects in patients with well-controlled diabetes . They used the Peruvian-grown variety of white Salvia hispanica called Salba , noted for its superior and consistent nutrient composition . Subjects eating Salba for three months ( compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in blood pressure and a 40 percent decrease in C-reactive protein levels , the inflammation marker that is a predictor of heart disease . Most important , Dr. Vuksan points out , the patients enjoyed eating the Salba bread , suggesting that it might help overcome a major hurdle in treating diabetes patients ' dietary compliance . <p> At the University of Antwerp in Belgium , independent researchers found similar improvements when healthy people added Salba to their diets for one month . Data showed reductions in blood pressure and triglyceride levels , but also that the subjects ' waistlines became smaller , even though none of them lost weight . " There was no change in total body weight , " Dr. Vuksan says , " but there was a difference in waist circumference , which indicates a change in body composition . " <p> Most Salvia hispanica research has been done with Salba , a white-blooming variety of the plant . The tiny white seeds are amazingly rich in dietary fiber and omega-3 fatty acids as well as calcium , iron , magnesium , and antioxidants . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing visceral fat . " This is important , " Dr. Vuksan stresses , " because accumulating fat around the belly is the main problem with respect to developing heart disease and especially diabetes . Once we have this ' spare tire ' around our belly , we get into trouble . " <p> The Toronto researchers have since identified further Salba potential . They found " impressive glucose-lowering effects of up to 40 percent " after meals , depending on how much Salba bread was eaten , Dr. Vuksan says . On average , each gram of Salvia hispanica reduces blood sugar levels by 2 percent . <p> Flax , which has a similar makeup and even more viscous dietary fiber , lowers blood sugar by about half that much , notes Dr. Vuksan . " We actually know the reason for this difference , " he explains . " The soluble fiber of Salba , although less than found in flax , is much more viscous on a per-gram basis . It has the ability to gel stronger with food in the gastrointestinal tract where it slows the absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be absorbed , but the increased length of time means the glucose level will not go as high after eating Salba-enriched starchy foods . " <p> Dr. Vuksan also says that Salba 's soft , permeable husk gels easily , whereas flax husk is hard . Salba can be consumed either as the whole seed or finely ground because both forms are equally effective in lowering glucose levels . On the other hand , he says , " I 'm not sure whether one will be able to see any effect with eating whole flax . " <p> Most recently , a study on Salba conducted at the University of Litoral in Santa Fe , Argentina , and published in the British Journal of Nutrition adds more to the Salba resume of benefits . Rats were fed for months with a sucrose-rich diet causing them to develop metabolic syndrome and obesity . Yet their condition was reversed by adding Salba to their diet . Their triglyceride levels came down , and abdominal fat was reduced . Additionally , their blood levels of omega-3 EPA increased . <p> The University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its potential to curb weight gain . A brief study of subjective satiety indicated Salba bread eaten for breakfast reduced the desire to eat by 40 to 60 percent two hours after a meal . <p> " Those are quite impressive results , " Dr. Vuksan says . " It 's a pretty big change with a practical amount of Salba . " <p> Next , researchers hope to study objective satiety , giving people a Salba preload and measuring how it actually affects eating behavior for the next meal . <p> " Clinical data to date , though preliminary , are encouraging to us , " Dr. Vuksan says , " especially at a time when everybody is looking at how to reduce food intake , lower body fat , and improve insulin sensitivity and diabetes control . After all , we all want to live forever . Maybe this ancient grain holds one of the keys .
