I AM A WESTERN WOMAN born in the Year of the Tiger . In fareastern astrology , each year is associated with a particular animal through a rotating twelve-year cycle . This dimly acknowledges that distant time before humanity chose to separate from the other creatures . A time when we all spoke the same tongue and could change form at will . A time that legends of many lands refer to as the Age of Gold . I keep an ear ready for stories about Year-Beasts from those who grew up in cultures with those beliefs . Often those tales have come from my two teachers , both of whom are Japanese and masters of the martial tradition of Budo . <p> One day I was lunching at a downtown Chinatown restaurant with a group of other students and both of my teachers after three days of intensive training . <p> I was seated next to my senior master . I asked him , " At other times you 've been kind enough to explain to me the nature of the years of monkey , rabbit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't discussed yet , which I 'm curious about . What are the traits of those born in the Year of the Horse ? " <p> My senior master , a dragon , thought for a moment . " Horse-year men are handsome and compelling , but not very bright , " he said . <p> " What about horse-year women ? " <p> My other master , who , like me , is a tiger , bent his head low over his soup and growled . <p> My dragon master turned his head to one side and waved his hand in front of him , as if he 'd caught a whiff of spoiled fish . " Not good , " he said . <p> " Really ? " I was fascinated . " In Western cultures horses are admired for their fleetness , beauty , and wild , free nature . " <p> My dragon master shook his head . <p> " Stubborn . Hard-headed . Bad-tempered , " my tiger master muttered , his ears laid well back to his skull . <p> " But surely some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . <p> They shared a brief glance in which my Western woman 's curiosity was n't welcome . <p> " Some say dogs , but I have n't observed that to be true . Of course , other horse-people . But other than that , none , at least not well , " my dragon master said firmly , closing the topic . I did n't pursue the issue . The relationship between dragon and tiger is defined as the mutual admiration of respectful adversaries , and should n't be pushed beyond this boundary . <p> Of course he 'd piqued my curiosity . Perseverance and patience are readily applied to hunting that premier prey , knowledge . I prowled through libraries and musty , dim bookstores , uncovering old texts on myths , legends , and customs of the ancient Far East . <p> No wonder my masters had been reluctant to speak ! Throughout the world and throughout history infanticide has been common . Yet nothing matched the drop in Asian newborns every Horse Year . <p> The tradition , as described , was that during any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilds to give birth by themselves without family or midwife - a dangerous proposition , and by itself cause enough to avoid a pregnancy . If a woman came back with a boy-child , her husband greeted her with relief . But often she 'd return pale and drained and announce with downcast eyes - without mentioning its sex - that the child had been stillborn and she 'd buried it in the bush . <p> As my studies led up to modern times , I learned that technology " improved on this practice . Amniocentesis allows a child to be sexed in utero and discreetly deleted if it proves to be an unwanted girl . <p> This knowledge filled me with sadness . Lost in the tenuous realm of might-have-been were generations of rambunctious , contentious , rearing , kicking , crow-hopping women who by their very nature made men uneasy ; caused tigers to slink off belly to the ground , and dragons to smolder with smoke in general disapproval and retreat to their lairs . <p> Several years passed before I discovered my studies were n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to , our masters hone our ability to see by rarely explaining . They teach by presenting the warriors ' art with quick , silent demonstrations . They instruct by the precept , " The student must steal technique from the teacher . " <p> So I took up instruction in Sumiei brushwork in order to train my eye and improve my perceptual abilities , hoping to become a better thief and . therefore a better student . I enrolled in an evening weekend course at the local community college . <p> Among the other students in the class , one young woman caught my attention . <p> Her features , though long and angular , hinted at Asian ancestry . Her hair was a thick , glossy , rebellious black that simultaneously bristled and flowed . The young men in the class did n't flirt with her as they did with the other girls . Apparently they did n't consider her pretty , but I thought her strongly beautiful . I found myself stroking her likeness onto my practice sheets as frequently as I practiced my kanji . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stretch out and massage cramped fingers as to drink coffee . <p> One evening during a break I struck up a conversation with the young woman with the arresting features . I told her my name . She told me that hers was Thera . We talked about the class : found that we both enjoyed the hypnosis of laying down line after line of velvet ink , freed from any goal or expectation other than the experience of each stroke . <p> Thera was taking the class because she wanted to use it in her artwork , and to try her hand at lettering . <p> I told her that I 'd begun to use the technique to train my eye and to experiment with sketching . That I liked the idea of rendering objects in calligraphic terms-trees , stones , birds , perhaps even people-not confessing that I 'd already used her as a subject . " For example , with that incredible mane of yours , I could translate you into an icon for the idea of ' horse , ' " I said , speaking tactfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " That would have amused my mother , " Thera said . " According to her people , the year I was born in was ruled by the horse . " <p> My pulse jumped . Since ceasing my investigations , I 'd never expected to hear of the subject again . <p> " She said I was lucky to have been born here . Horse-year women were considered undesirable back in the old country . " <p> " Really ? " I feigned ignorance . " Why ? " <p> Thera shrugged , grinned . " Bad Attitude . Lord knows / had it . Whenever I threw a temper tantrum , to get me to behave she 'd trot out " ( Thera grinned at her own pun ) " some old story or another about how babies born in the Year of the Horse were abandoned in the forest to die as soon as they were born . Trouble was , her trick worked too well - they scared me half to death . Then she had to tell me other stories to get me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . <p> A long time ago , and very far away , one frigid day a woman hid in some undergrowth after leaving her girl baby exposed on some rocks . This woman was determined that if her child must die , it would die from exposure , not from being torn apart by wild animals . She 'd decided to stay and leap out to intervene if she had to , until the baby passed away in a peaceful manner . <p> After a while she heard something large moving through the bushes - slowly and methodically , as if it had been tracking her . fust then the baby began to cry from hunger . The creature in the brush , stopped , listening . The woman tensed and prepared to defend her doomed child . <p> The creature emerged out onto the rock . It was another woman . But such a woman ! Thin , with a long face , barefoot , wiry , dressed in a rough garment woven from bark strings , with matted bristling hair . The wild woman went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vanished back into the brush before the astonished mother could react . <p> The mother went home and told her husband that she 'd borne a dead child . She said nothing of the wild woman . <p> The mother had three more children in the years that followed , including another daughter . Time passed and her children grew to adulthood . Finally , her daughter suffered the misfortune of also becoming pregnant with a Horse-year child . <p> When the time came for the heavy-hearted daughter to go out alone to give birth in the wilderness , the mother drew the young woman aside . <p> " If your child is a boy , hurry home with him as soon as you can walk again , " the older woman said . " But if it 's a girl , leave it in a clearing and hide yourself nearby . It would be a disgrace to let an infant suffer the fate of being devoured alive by wild animals . Hard as it may be for you , wait until the baby dies . Or perhaps something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The daughter was mystified by her mother 's words , but since she was beginning to labor she bad to hurry away . She came home later without a child , in a state of amazement . <p> " Mother , I gave birth to a girl . I did as you said , and three wild women came out of the forest and took my baby . Did you know that a miracle would happenl " <p> The mother told her daughter what had happened to her three twelve-year cycles before . <p> Ever after that , if a woman became Horse-year pregnant , some other woman would warn the mother-to-be to watch and wait . In this way the women of the village came to understand that there was a whole community of wild Horse-year women living deep in the woods . During Horse Years these feral women drifted outward to the edge of the forest . They prowled its borders , watching for the lone pregnant women to come and give birth and repopulate their ranks . <p> Thera finished the story , took a few sips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us back into the classroom to resume our inky mediations . <p> But I could n't concentrate . My mind filled with images of all those women-the tamed and domesticated dog , rat , snake , monkey , and even tiger and dragon women bringing their new little fillies to the tough feral women of the woods and heights . <p> I thought of babies growing to awareness with older sisters who were twelve ; mothers who were twenty-four , thirty-six , and forty-eight ; grandmothers of sixty , seventy-two , and eighty-four . <p> A week later I lined up behind Thera at the coffee machine . <p> " You did n't get a chance to tell me if your mother 's story worked , " I said as she pushed the thermal paper cup under the spigot . A steaming dark liquid poured out . Its color and smell resembled boiling ink . Thera made a face at it as she stood aside and let me slide my own cup into place . I chose tea . <p> " My mother 's story ? Worked ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared about abandoned babies left to die ? " <p> " Oh , that . " Thera laughed , remembering . " Yeah . Probably worked too well . After that she could n't do anything with me . Whenever we got into it , I 'd diss her and tell her I wish she had n't left the old country , and had left me out in the forest . That I 'd have been better off with a bunch of savages than with her . Pretty cruel , huh ? Kids ! " She shook her head . <p> " Did she ever tell you more stories about them ? " <p> Thera sipped her coffee , wrinkled her nose at the bitter fluid . " After that she did n't want to give me any more ammunition against her . Ca n't say I blame her . I pestered her for a while , though . She told me just a few more , but only if she could use them to lay some sort of scold on me . " <p> Back near the beginning of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other creatures , there was a great tribe of horse folk . They lived in meadows near the eastern edge of the great sea that we now call the Pacific Ocean . <p> The horse folk were a proud people and did n't mix with the other animal tribes . Eventually they became too populous , their country overgrazed . They had a legend that they 'd originally come from a vast paradise that they 'd wandered away from . They decided to search for this homeland . <p> They divided into three clans . <p> The strongest and proudest clan declared that they 'd never change from their true nature , nor mix with creatures of other animal tribes . They decided to search to the south and west . <p> The second clan said that though they might consort with other creatures , it would always be on their own terms , so that they 'd never lose their proud horse hearts . This clan traveled northward . <p> Before these two clans left , they made solemn vows to each other : Though a million million turns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; though they might change in appearance ; though this great event of the division and scattering of the horse tribe might pass from memory ; still , their children 's children 's children would recognize each other in their hearts when they met again . <p> The first clan eventually ended up in the Middle East . Theyremained what we know today as true horses . <p> The clan that searched to the north traveled until they encountered cold , bleak harshness . To survive , they changed and more and more took on the appearance of men and women , with humankind 's ability to adapt and endure anywhere . <p> After the other two clans left , the third and last clan looked around and said , " Why should we leavel There 's plenty of room and forage for us now . " These were the laziest , least proud members of the horse tribe . They reasoned that if things became difficult again , they could find a way to get along with the other animal clans . <p> Some of the mare-women weren ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clan , but to no avail . <p> Over time this complacent part of the horse tribe made peace and intermarried with the children of men who lived nearby , until almost all of them willingly gave up their horse ways and proud intractable hearts . <p> Only a few women were born from time to time as throwbacks . The rest of the tribe felt their implacability and anger and drove them away , until they had to take their place in the line of years with all the other fractional animal natures left in humanity . And we already know how ' mankind dealt with them . <p> It was time to get back to class . Thera noticed my sadness . She touched my arm lightly and said it was only a folk tale , meant to warn her not to be lazy . <p> Over the remaining weeks of the course we came to be friends , after a fashion . I told her about my work , my evenings spent training in the dojo . She told me more about her life . Her mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to immigrate to this country . A few years later she gave birth to Thera . <p> I once asked Thera about horses - real horses - if she 'd ever ridden any . She said no , though like most girls she 'd been crazy about them . She knew her father had ridden . He 'd even competed on the rodeo circuit when he was young , before he joined the Air Force . He was part Cheyenne , raised on a reservation . But except for his time in the rodeo , his childhood was something sooner forgotten , left behind . He wanted the Anglo-American dream : a career ( in his case in the military ) , three children , a nice house not far from the base , an apron-wearing wife waiting at the end of the day with a tray of fresh-baked cookies in her oven-mitted hands and a roast in the oven . <p> Thera did n't know what her mother wanted , but it was n't that . She finally left , taking Thera with her . Thera had n't seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he married again and started a new life , complete with the three kids , house , and the cookies . <p> When Thera was ten her mother remarried , this time to a salesman with an Irish lilt to his voice . Two years later her mother gave birth to a second child , a boy . <p> During adolescence , Thera 's relationship with her mother went south in a big way . They fought constantly . Thera said any folk tales from that time of her life were grimly cautionary . <p> As the forests and badlands throughout Asia shrank , the wild Horse-year women were hard-pressed to keep their secret ways . At the same time , busy meddling humanity invented devices and nostrums to prevent or interrupt pregnancy . Fewer and fewer girl babies were brought to them . <p> Faced with extinction , the wild women found desperate solutions . Every twelve years they emerged and stole clothing from the villages . Disguised with these garments , the younger among them traveled to distant towns and indentured themselves to brothels until they were impregnated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home to the forest . <p> Some became infected with monstrous diseases . Others were beaten by the men they served . But if a Horse-year girl started young enough , and was lucky and healthy , she might bear three children in her lifetime . If she were very lucky , they might be three girls to add to the herd . If she wasn ' t so fortunate , the isolated Buddhist monasteries never , looked for answers when they found infant boys left on their doorsteps . <p> THERA AND HER MOTHER battled it out for a few years . When Thera began her junior year in high school , her stepfather got reassigned to a new sales " aK. territory in another state . Her mother made arrangements for Thera to live with friends until she finished school , then took Thera 's little half-brother and went to join her husband . Thera found a waitressing job the next summer , so she stayed put , and had been on her own ever since . <p> Thera was part-timing her way through college ; waitressing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might take her forever to graduate , but she was determined . She loved art , and tended to postpone taking prerequisite courses if she could slip in an extra painting , pastel , or sketching class . <p> The Sumiei class ended . I expected to see Thera the next semester , when the more advanced follow-up class began . <p> She never showed . When I asked , the instructor said that though Thera 'd signed up , at the last minute she phoned in a message saying she 'd started a new waitressing job , so she was dropping the course . <p> In martial arts one is constantly having to detach , so I let it go . My own life needed attending to . I had my work , my training , my own studies to focus on . <p> I ran into her about a year later . I 'd been working the wee small hours with some colleagues at my job on a team project . We decided to take a break . Every place was closed , except for a diner - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . As we walked in , Thera was walking out . She obviously worked there : She wore a coat slung on her shoulders over a pastel-colored , white trimmed uniform , her name embroidered over the left breast pocket . I greeted her with surprise , talked with her briefly as my associates went on ahead to get a booth . She said she was going off-shift . She looked thinner , with dark circles under her eyes , and seemed nervous , ill-at-ease . I let her go . <p> When I slid into the booth , a middle-aged waitress was taking our order . The name embroidered on her uniform was Paige . <p> " So , you know Thera ? " she asked . <p> I said yes , just a little . That I 'd been in an art class with her . I asked Paige if she knew if Thera had finished college . <p> " No , not with all the crap she 's been dealing with . " <p> The waitress told me that months before Thera had gotten involved in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn his apartment house into condominiums . He illegally served notice on his tenants . Thera dug in her heels and fought him . She came home from work one night to find the locks changed on her apartment . All her belongings - such as they were - had been moved out onto the sidewalk and plundered by passers-by . <p> She took the landlord to court and won . In revenge he refused to reimburse her cleaning and security deposits . She took him back to court and won again . She 'd never seen a dime from either settlement . <p> " Everything she 'd already lost , and then the legal fees , wiped her out , " Paige said . " I know she does n't have a phone number anymore . I think she 's too proud to say it , but I 'd lay odds she 's living out of her old Dodge . " <p> The next night I waited in my car in the diner parking lot . When Thera got off work I followed her . She drove to a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their garages or driveways . Her car blended in with the others on the street . I parked several cars behind her and watched her silhouette clamber from the front to the back seat . Then I got out of my car , walked over and knocked on her side window . Bundled in a blanket , she rose like a ghost to the glass . <p> " Thera , you ca n't do this . It 's not safe . You 're coming home with me . " <p> She did n't protest . She followed my car back to my flat . <p> I do n't have a spare bedroom , but the sofa in my living room was a futon . For the next few months Thera stayed at my place . <p> She worked days at a convenience store , waitressed nights . Her survival skills fascinated me . Her first priorities had n't been saving for a new apartment and basics like phone service and furnishings , but rather the rental of a post office box ( so she 'd still get bank statements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y ( so she could bathe regularly ) . Her car afforded her a free - though risky-place to sleep . The restaurant provided her with free food : She 'd been feeding herself off of half-eaten dinners returned to the kitchen . The other waitresses tactfully turned a blind eye . She could eat regular meals at the diner , of course , but their cost would be deducted from her paycheck . <p> Thera said she was lucky she had n't lost all her clothing when the landlord tossed her stuff-only the few nice things she owned . The sidewalk traffic had n't been interested in her old T-shirts and jeans . Since then she 'd kept her clothes in a cardboard box in her car trunk , and used the time she spent in laundromats to nap as much as to keep her clothes clean . <p> " They left this , though . " From her car Thera unloaded a portfolio jerry-rigged from two pieces of cardboard taped together at the bottom . It contained artwork from her classes . " Did n't take much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nudes from a life-drawing workshop . I like to think I 've upgraded the porn collection of some dirty old man . " <p> The diner was low-end , the tips especially poor late at night . " But it 's safe working there nights . " Thera intended on hanging on until a slot opened during the day or early evening shifts . " I figure I 'll quit working at the convenience store at that point . " <p> I nodded in support , I felt relieved that her convenience store gig was during the day , but those places were n't secure at any hour . <p> " I should have enough to get a new place of my own again by then , maybe even enough to go back to school , " she continued . <p> I told her she could stay as long as she wanted , that she would n't be a bother . <p> And she was n't . Between her work and mine and my training , I hardly ever saw her . She refused any help other than my couch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late breakfast on Sundays , the only time our schedules intersected . <p> As the circles under her eyes faded her confidence grew along with her savings . She relaxed and grew talkative at our weekly brunches . She told me about moving around a lot as a military brat before her parents ' divorce . She told me about first getting interested in art in a high school class . She told me about old boyfriends : She might not have the kind of beauty that turned male heads , but she 'd had a few lovers . Her affairs always ended in acrimony . " But that 's the same as everybody else , is n't it ? Who ever ends up being friends with an ex ? " she grimaced . <p> I did n't contradict her , just said I 'd had my share of failed relationships too . <p> She remembered I was intrigued by folklore , shared what few more of her mother 's stories she recalled . <p> In ancient , ancient times , when the great horse clan split into three tribes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desolate place . There the tribe took on the form of humankind , with humans ' ability to adapt . Even that was not enough . Finally , facing starvation , ibis northern tribe had to split again . Half roamed farther and farther to the west , until some of them arrived at a great island . They could go no farther , stopped by a gray stormy ocean that extended beyond their comprehension . Thousands of years later true horses from the south finally reached this northwestern tribe , now known as the Irish Tinkers or Travelers . The two long-separated tribes knew each other , drew together in ways the rest of mankind found eerie , uncanny , and spoke of in low tones about " horse-whisperers . " <p> When she was n't working , Thera spent most of her time sleeping . However , on Sundays she started to sketch again . I left pencils and scrap paper out for her , found myself buying flowers when I shopped on Saturdays so she 'd have something nice to draw . She sang or hummed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her voice had a pleasant , husky bluegrass quality to it . Sunday evenings I 'd rent a film . We huddled on the futon , wrapped in chenille afghans , eating popcorn , glued to the tube for the length of the movie and on through to the end of the eleven o'clock news with its summary of the day 's strife . <p> She came home from work late one Saturday night lit with excitement . Some students she knew from the college happened to stop by the diner , stayed to hang out with her on her break . That was all she could talk about Sunday . On Monday Thera went to the college and picked up a catalog for the next semester . She pored over descriptions of the upcoming night and weekend classes . <p> Her diner became the late-night hang-out for her college acquaintances . She began doing things with them on her days off . I was glad she had new friends and that for the first time since I 'd met her , her burdens had ebbed to the point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her when she dashed out of the house as soon as we 'd shared our Sunday morning meal . <p> After a few weeks , she began to talk more and more about one particular member of the group - a boy , also into art , and , like her , an itinerant student . She said at first that he was just a friend . " We 're on the same page . It 's nice to be able to talk to somebody else who 's had to pick themselves up by their bootstraps . " <p> I wanted to sigh . I stopped myself . Thera 's face wanned and softened when she talked about this kid . It was obvious where this was leading . <p> A week later she told me with delighted wonder that he 'd asked her out . The rest of the group would n't be tagging along . <p> In spite of my best efforts , I must have looked uneasy . <p> " Do n't worry , " she said quickly . " I would n't bring somebody here into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , he 's like you - encouraging me to go back to school . You 'd like him . " <p> After that , she came home to my couch less and less , as I knew she would . <p> After only a month she announced she was moving in with him . She swore it would be different this time : He was an artist - they understood each other . His apartment was the biggest place she 'd lived in since her childhood . ( I looked around at my flat and knew that in her own mind she 'd never occupied it on any level . ) He was even going to cover what would have been her share of first and last month 's rent . <p> As soon as Thera said this , warning bells rang in my head . To put her in his debt this way as they began their relationship-he was thinking of the eventual bottom line , even if she was n't . <p> Knowing that nothing could have dampened her enthusiasm or her happiness , I kept my opinion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . <p> " I 'll be able to save up even faster . I 'll pay you back for all your help , " Thera said . <p> " Not necessary . You 've cost me nothing , " I replied . " If you want to do anything for me , use the extra money to quit one of your jobs . " <p> When she moved out , we hugged awkwardly . -I realized later that she had n't left me her new address . I never did meet the boy . <p> When the northern-bound clan split , the other half traveled east until it came to a great bridge of ice . Because of their horse courage and stubbornness , they crossed over it . Af ter many further travails they came to a vast , beautiful country and knew it to be their ancestral homeland . Some turned back to tell the other clans so that all the horse tribes could be reunited once again . But it was too late . The ice bridge had melted behind them . <p> IRETURNED to my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the diner for a late-night supper . I did n't see Thera , but Paige was on duty . She said Thera had indeed transferred to the day shift , had quit the convenience store job and signed up for night-school classes . Paige said she seemed happy . <p> I felt a pang at that . I told myself it was just a stab of poignant gladness for Thera . <p> I did n't have an occasion to go back to the diner for almost a year . When I did , it was after another late-night haul at work . <p> Paige was there . I teased her about her omnipresence at the diner . She just smiled and said she liked working the night shift . It left her time for her family during the day . <p> " How is Thera doing ? " I made myself ask . <p> Paige looked surprised . " Did n't you know ? Has n't she been in touch with you ? " <p> I shook my head . <p> Paige looked over her shoulder . The diner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . She slid into the seat across from me and began to talk : <p> Things had gone bad again for Thera . She 'd cleaned out her bank " account supporting her boyfriend so he could hurry up and graduate . The agreement was that he 'd then do the same for her . Shortly after he got out of school he dumped her for somebody else and left . But not before taking every scrap of cash Thera had lying around the house . He left a note explaining he was reimbursing himself for the first and last month 's rent he 'd fronted her . <p> Thera found herself suddenly saddled with an apartment she could n't afford alone , and had n't found a trustworthy roommate yet . She 'd dropped out of her classes , gone back to the convenience store , though she 'd had to take the night shift this time . <p> " I worry about her , " Paige said . " Those convenience stores are risky places . There 's been a string of robberies lately . " She shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working woman too tough to shiver . " I 'm glad my kids are still too young to watch the late news . They 've been showing surveillance footage of the hold-ups , complete with clerks getting beat up , hoping someone will recognize something . " <p> I asked Paige if she knew which store Thera worked at . <p> Paige shook her head , no . " She 's never said . Could be anywhere . There are dozens of them - one every few blocks . " <p> I left my phone number with Paige , in case Thera had lost it , and asked Paige to post a note for Thera to call me . <p> I waited a couple of weeks , but did n't hear from her . That did n't surprise me . I 'd guessed she 'd be too stubborn and proud . Then I looked for a number for her in the phone book . There was none . The phone must still , have been listed in the boyfriend 's name . <p> As if to punish me for my lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven o'clock news seemed filled with nothing but stories about car jackings and convenience store robberies . Each time the late-news anchors ' faces grew sober and their . voices dropped with gravitas - " Be warned that you fm'ght find the following footage shocking .... The police are asking for the public 's help .... " - I froze . Finally I could n't stand the stress of twitching at every newscast . I resolved that the coming weekend I 'd start my search . <p> I trained for an hour or two after work that Friday , then went home to cook a late dinner and go to bed . Tomorrow Pd start to look for Thera at the restaurant . Paige had told me she sometimes worked days on the weekends . <p> I turned on the tube and half-listened to it as I fixed my supper . The anchor announced upcoming footage of another heist in the early morning hours of the night before , warned of its violent content .

One vaulted the counter by the cash register . He confronted two employees - one of them Thera . Her strong features were unmistakable , even in the grainy videocam footage . The store 's other worker , a slender East Indian man , put his hands over his head and dropped immediately to the floor . <p> Thera wedged herself in front of the cash register and began to argue with the robbers . Her lips framed clipped-off words in the mute shuddering-frame footage . I saw all the rage in her Ufe boiling up at last in her stance - rage for the boys who betrayed her , the mother who scolded and then deserted her , the landlords who cheated her , the thieves who robbed her . <p> " No , Thera , no , " I whispered . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I cringed , waiting for the silent shot . Instead he pistol-whipped her , bashing her temples back and forth . Motion jarred and jumped to motion , like an old silent movie . She slowly slid behind the counter . The grainy film could n't disguise the baffled stubborn anger filling her still-open eyes . Then only her feet and ankles could be seen sticking out on the floor . <p> The gunmen plundered the cash register quickly . Two of them ran out of the monitor 's range . The third leaned his shotgun over the counter and fired twice . Thera 's legs jerked with each impact , then stopped twitching . <p> I heard terrible anguished noises , right there in my kitchen . I had leapt to my feet and was weeping , my fingers clawing at air . <p> It was now simple finding Thera . I called the cops , told them I was an ex-roommate . <p> " When he was beating her , the perp 's glove rode up , " a detective told me . " When he jumped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ran it through the system . We got him . " <p> Thera was n't in the morgue . The detective said she 'd survived . Since she was poor , they 'd taken her to the county hospital . <p> Worms of tubing wove in and out of her nostrils , mouth and veins , burrowing through the hospital gown to find homes in her vital organs . Where they emerged , they emptied yellow and wine-colored fluids into clear plastic purses . <p> Thera 's rangy , tough , mustanger body still lived . Little else did . Her brain had hemorrhaged and swollen from the pistol whipping . Her eyes were usually open , but nobody looked out from behind them anymore . <p> The gunshots had torn through muscle and bone , perforated her intestines . <p> For weeks Thera lay flaccid in her hospital bed , a ripped-apart rag toy . I went to visit her every few days . <p> I thought about our time spent together . How very little I 'd given her , how very much she 'd given me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , said nothing of my own . She 'd probably thought I was just a good listener . Meanwhile I 'd been taking from her as much as anybody else in her life . <p> Grieving and guilty , I finally shared , I told her of the lives of tigers - our legends , our hopes and dreams , our essentially selfish natures . <p> There was no response from Thera . Her body contained only an evergrowing emptiness . <p> Her condition stabilized . Most of the tubes were withdrawn , except for the nutrient drips and catheter . They moved her to a county ward . I still went to visit , but told her no more tales of tigers . Instead I just sat on a powder blue , cracked-vinyl chair . For a long time I was as mute as she . <p> Then one day I began telling her stories again . Not about tigers . About horses . <p> At last the southern clan of true horses found their way back to the ancestral homeland when the Spanish conquistadors brought them over in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encountered the eastern tribe that had returned over the ice bridge all those eons ago . As their ancestors had pledged , something in them recognized each other . <p> I still visit every few days and continue to tell Thera these stories . I see changes in her now . Sometimes there 's more color in her face . Sometimes less . I notice differences in her breathing . I feel something filling her . <p> The staff here has told me gently that these are only physiological changes as her body slowly slips toward death . I do n't know . Maybe her body is filling itself with death . Maybe with something else . Maybe with a great change . <p> Back in the land of the lazy tribe , the abandoned and persecuted horse-yeai women became wilder , tougher , stronger . With each succeeding generation the human blood and influence within them faded . They grew closer and closer to their original horse nature . <p> Some of these women fled - smuggling themselves on boats or planes , or marrying themselves away to traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way back to the homeland . Once they arrive they seek those they recognize in their hearts - theplainsmen and their painted ponies , or the Irish Tinkers , also driven to make the last jump across the sea . And when they find these men they recognize , the horse-year women mate and breed every twelve years , coming closer to - home within themselves . <p> While I sit here and talk to Thera I am thinking . I 'm thinking of those who trap and kill mustangs for dog food . I 'm thinking of gun-toting thieves and cheating landlords and traitorous lovers . I 'm thinking of mothers who try to tell their daughters fairy tales to pass on the knowledge of their origins , but who are misunderstood . And who themselves misunderstand that in the end , it is n't legends that will save us . <p> Long ago my dragon master set me to reading ancient texts as part of my training . In those texts I found this saying : " He who teaches a woman how to use a sword is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle , and my master has trained me well in the art of the blade . <p> This is the homeland . The Age of Iron ends , the circle turns . Thegreat horse tribes are reuniting . This is the renewed land . In the midst of turmoil and myth , the animals are returning . Their spirits wake from where they 've slept under mountains and old riverbeds . They 're filling our bodies once again . They will be our bodies once again . <p> Author Affiliation
