Sara Nelson is the consummate publishing insider . She has covered books as editor , reviewer , reporter and columnist for such media outlets as Glamour , the New York Times , Self , the Wall Street Journal , Oxygen and the New York Observer . Nelson set out on a mission to read 52 books in 52 weeks and write about her experience . The result is So Many Books , So Little Time : A Year of Passionate Reading ( Putnam ; 242 pages ) . TIME spoke with Nelson : <P> How did your family feel about your project ? <P> I do n't think they got it at first . I 'm not sure I really got it at first . I always knew that this would not be 52 book reviews , that it would not be me impersonating Harold Bloom , telling people what they should read or what the great books are , the canon . I always knew that it would be more personal than that . I did n't know quite how personal it was going to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . <P> You write about preferring fiction . Do you suspect that most women feel the same way ? <P> I would imagine so . For very educated people , there 's still a little whiff of disapproval of fiction . If I say I 'm staying home and reading a biography of William Randolph Hearst , you would think I was one kind of person . If I said I was staying home reading Heartburn by Nora Ephron , you would think I was another kind of person . I think that 's where the chick-lit moniker comes from , which I find a bit offensive . <P> Everyone is so busy these days . What is your advice about finding time to read ? <P> Never leave the house without a book  --  ever  --  even if you think you 're just going to the grocery store to pick up a carton of milk or you 're driving . I 'm not suggesting that people should read while they 're driving , but if you 're stuck in a traffic jam or get a flat tire and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are all kinds of moments in the day that are reading moments . I actually prefer to take the bus to work rather than the subway because it 's a much more pleasant experience . People say , " Oh , but it takes so long . " And it does . But I use that as reading time . I do n't watch a lot of TV . <P> Your son Charlie is 9 now . Does he like books ? <P> He 's still not a passionate reader , but now he says that he likes to read . It worried me that he was n't much of a reader . We now set reading times , that we 're going to read for half an hour now . I stay there with him , and I read my book . It 's something we do together , as much as you can read together . I never thought that I was a great read-aloud parent . I was n't patient enough . I did n't like the books enough , especially when he was little . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a chapter , and I 'll read it too , and then we 'll talk about it . We 're doing it now with the Lemony Snicket books . <P> What 's good this season ?
