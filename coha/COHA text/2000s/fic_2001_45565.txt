IN APRIL 2120 THE TEST SHIP Probe left Earth orbit , powered by the annihilation of matter and antimatter . Since the discovery a decade previously of a tiny anti-iron asteroid and its successful harvesting employing elegant containment techniques , new superthrust engines had empowered ships to boost to the orbit of Saturn within eight weeks , a situation which the available supply of antimatter would permit for another thirty years . <p> But Probe was not testing antimatter propulsion . Probe was to test the Q-drive which theoretically should advance a ship to the nearer stars through probability-space , the underlying condition of reality , within several months instead of decades . Probe 's destination : Tau Ceti , twelve light years away . <p> By June 2120 Probe was sufficiently far out of the gravity well of the Sun for the Q-drive to switch on , and , as planned and hoped for , the test ship vanished  --  to reappear in the solar system a little over six months later , inward bound . <p> When Probe was recovered , the dozen rats on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six little monkeys , five survived in decent shape . The sixth was a victim of its food supply jamming . All the animals had been caged separately , though spaciously , supplied with exercise equipment and toys . Time-lapse cameras recorded nothing untoward during the journey through Q-space to the outskirts of Tau Ceti and back . <p> While Probe had lingered on those outskirts , it had established that , of the planets of Tau Ceti already detected from the solar system , the second possessed a promising biosphere : an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere , oceans , weather systems over the scattered landmasses . Even if only simple cells lived on that world , they had been beavering away for a long time to good purpose . <p> In 2123 construction of Earth 's first crewed starship , Pioneer , began . Four years later the large ship was ready .... <p> Long before Doctor Mary Nolan enters Pioneer itself , she is thoroughly familiar with the spacious interior from virtual reality training . The Q-drive pod jutting ahead like a long battering ram tipped with a samovar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stem , together form a long central spindle around which the great doughnut of living quarters rotates quickly enough to provide imitation gravity at half a gee . The doughnut houses a hundred cabins , one for each crew member . <p> Bed-couches are big enough that the dozen couples who are already married or partnered can bunk with one another , though who knows what may happen during the course of such an expedition ? The potential for privacy is important . On top of her medical qualifications Mary 's second string is psychiatry . Aside from the months necessary to progress beyond Saturn , and the six-month trip through Q-space , plus at least a year spent in the Tau Ceti system , colonization is possible ( three shuttles are strapped to the spindle ) , so the ship is provisioned for a generous four years , not to mention the food that will be grown on board hydroponically . <p> After the obligatory pre-departure fortnight spent in quarantine  --  ten persons per isolation unit  --  the interior of Pioneer strikes Mary as particularly spacious . ( After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roomy ? ) At half a gee her tread is buoyant  --  yet deliberate and cautious , as is the pace of other colleagues newly aboard . <p> " Hi , Gisela ! " It 's dark-haired athletic Dr. Gisela Frick , who is qualified in microbiology and biochemistry as well as medicine and physiotherapy . Mary did not share quarantine with Gisela , nor with the expedition surgeon Dr. Yukio Yamamoto , nor with dentist and geologist Howard Coover . A surprise infection must not catch the prime medical team all together . Back-up personnel were in separate quarantine units as a precaution  --  a whole duplicate crew had trained . <p> " How does it feel to you , Gisela ? " <p> " To be really aboard at last ? Great ! Ah , do you mean the motion .. ? It 's okay . " Gisela swings her head skittishly . " Oops . " <p> The floor consists of flat sections each a couple of meters long , gently tilting with respect to one another . Curved flooring would have presented an engineering problem as regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in many other respects , but the sense of down-orientation shifts subtly as a person walks . What 's more , there are the effects of Coriolis force . Hurrying , or abrupt changes of direction , could disorient and nauseate . <p> " The anti-nausea pills seem to be effective , " says Gisela . Of course without the centripetal semblance of gravity the rate of bone-loss would be unacceptable . " I wonder whether there could be long-term problems with tendonitis ? Might we end up like birds gripping imaginary branches ? " <p> This is not something that the virtual reality tours were able to simulate . At the moment the difference from true semi-gravity is trivial . Can it lead to physical impairment in the long run ? Not that anyone will try running around the main corridors , but only jogging on stationary treadmills . <p> Greeting colleagues after a fortnight 's separation from them , and nodding to fellow quarantinees , Mary and Gisela head for their clinic , not to inventory it , but more to check that it corresponds exactly with virtuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gyms and the science labs and the restaurant ( for the sociable ) and the recreation hall and the hydroponics  --  cum-botany garden .... Yes , the ship is surely big enough for a hundred people to share and work together harmoniously for ages . Failing harmony and happiness , there . is always recourse to one 's private cabin with computer access to a treasury of literature , music , games , and virtual experiences from skiing to scuba-diving , all the way through the alphabet of possibilities and back again . <p> People , people  --  under the command of Commander Sherwin Peterson . Mary knows those with whom she was in quarantine quite intimately by now , many others rather well to varying degrees , and none of the others are exactly strangers ; besides which , she can screen all available data about them . No excuse , after the first few days of waiting in Earth orbit , for not matching names to faces instantly . <p> The official language of Pioneer is English , but she hears occasional German and French and Japanese too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Euro-Union , Australia , and Japan . If a foothold can be established on Tau Ceti 2 , the Chinese plan their own independent ship . No one can argue with that . <p> Here 's John Dolby , the climatologist , John James Pine , geologist and one of the three shuttle pilots , Eric Festa , nutrition , botany , and hydroponics , Denise Dubois , astrophysics , Carmen Santos , engineering , Chikahiro Suzuki , computer systems , navigator Nellie van Torn .... <p> TWO MONTHS LATER , Pioneer has passed the realm of Saturn ( although its be-ringed monarch is far away ) and no failures have occurred , neither of machine nor man , nor woman , aside from various minor ailments , swiftly diagnosed and cured . Mary and her two medical colleagues monitor everyone 's health , making sure that sodium and iron levels do not rise . In liaison with Eric Festa they supply mineral supplements where required . An Australian pair of partners , Sandy Tate and Jeff Lee , oceanography and life science respectively , are pregnant  --  or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering quarantine , either accidentally or irresponsibly . Their child will be born toward the end of the six-month transit through Q-space , a first for the human race . Mary will keep a careful eye on Sandy . By now almost everyone is on first name terms . Pilot Pine is Jay-Jay ; Dr. Suzuki is Chika . The ship is a family . How appropriate that a family should have a baby . A few other pairings are occurring , Jay-Jay and Denise , for instance . Mary is feeling a growing fondness and shoots of desire for Eric Festa , who reciprocates her feelings . Eric , from Dortmund , is a nourishing person to know . The two often sit in the botany section and talk amidst the orchids  --  for beauty  --  and tomatoes and carrots and soy beans for a nutritious diet . <p> On the evening , ship-time , preceding Q-day there 's a feast in the restaurant from the ample store of varied vacuum-packed reduced sodium and iron gourmet meals . <p> " Compliments to the chef ! " someone calls out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric declares , prompting laughter and applause . Spirits are high . <p> Afterward , Com Sherwin reminds everyone of procedures . When the time comes to switch on the Q-drive , all personnel other than those on the bridge must be in their cabins tethered to their bed-couches . Probe encountered no visible problems when entering Q-space . Nevertheless , err on the safe side . Transient side effects that rats and monkeys could not report might affect human beings . Psychological or perceptual glitches , akin to the mild imbalance caused by Coriolis force . <p> Com Sherwin has an Air Force background , back in his younger days where backgrounds should be , his route from daring test pilot to astronaut training . He piloted the first hazardous antimatter-asteroid reconnaissance . Later , famously , he had risked his life taking The Dart on a flythrough the clouds of Jupiter , en route ramming a gas-whale and carrying it back into space with him spitted on The Dart , indeed draped around The Dart , its collapsed quick-frozen carcass almost enfolding his ship , a gift to science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probes that had dropped into Jupiter only two had ever spotted gas-whales . <p> Interviewed on Systemwide : " Are n't the gas-whales very rare ? " <p> Peterson : " Not in that huge volume of atmosphere . Not necessarily . " <p> " Were n't you risking your ship and your life on a sudden impulse ? " <p> Peterson : " I had several seconds to think . I reckoned I had a good chance . " <p> " Apparently your pulse rate did n't even rise . " <p> Peterson had merely grinned , engagingly . <p> " So what 's your favorite book then , Moby-Dick ? " <p> " No , actually it 's Linda Bernstein 's Be Your Own Leader at Peace with Yourself . I read a page a night . " <p> Peterson was solid . Capable of split-second decisiveness , yet possessing a balanced serenity , and also a folksy touch if need be . <p> Mary is lying abed dressed in mission multipocket-wear , green for medic , in the cabin that by now seems as familiar and homelike as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones of Com Sherwin from her comp speakers as Sherwin talks through the Q-sequence , only partly understood by her . She remembers doing her best to understand a lecture at Mission Control , given as part of the year-long training schedule . <p> " Fundamentally , " a dapper , bearded Physics Professor had said , " the Q-drive functions as a quantum computer that is given the problem of translating a ship from Sunspace to Tau Ceti space . Your actual ship 's computer for everyday use is a super-duper Turing-type machine . When you access your ship 's computer , it may sound to you like an artificial intelligence  --  the software 's designed to be user-friendly  --  but we 're still twenty years away from genuine AI . <p> " Aw , sixty years ago people were saying the same , and AI has n't happened yet , so I ai n't making any prophecies . <p> " Anyway , if you set a Turing machine a really big task  --  for example , tell it to factorize a 500-digit number  --  it 'll tackle solutions one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the machine is really fast . In a quantum computer , on the other hand , all the possible answers are superposed . Superimposed simultaneously , as it were . Bingo , the wrong answers cancel each other out , and you get the right one . Not that this happens instantaneously  --  it still takes time . In the case of determining a route to Tau Ceti all routes are considered including going via Sirius or Andromeda or even by way of a quasar at the far side of the universe . Quantum theory sums over all paths between two points , as we say , and that means all possible paths . " <p> " Does this mean , " someone asked , " that we might end up in another galaxy ? " <p> " No no , Probe proved that wo n't happen . The nonsense routes cancel out . Now a quantum device such as the drive is very specialized and needs to be kept as isolated as possible . It 's entangled with the ship , but regular computing on board still has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit had stuck up his hand . " I 'd say that the Q-drive is the real touring machine ! " <p> " Very droll . I was referring to computer pioneer Alan Turing , who unbelievably was hounded to suicide because he was differently sexed . " Evidently a cause of anguish and anger to this lecturer . <p> Sum over paths , Mary muses . <p> Some Over-Paths . Ways of jumping from here to there . Or perhaps of burrowing . <p> Samovar Paths , in view of the shape of the Q-drive unit .... <p> Summer Paths , the bright way to the stars . However , the appearance of Q-space as recorded by Probe 's cameras was an ocean of gray frogspawn .... <p> " Initiating primary power uptake .... We have four green balls .... Sixty seconds to Q-insertion .... " <p> " Thirty seconds .... " <p> " Fifteen .... " <p> The seconds pass . The cabin quivers and shimmers and is the same again . Same photos of family and friends and scenery sticky-tacked to the walls . Same dream-catcher mobile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silence , silence apart from the softest hum from the speakers . <p> Has communication failed ? In Q-space can no one hear you make announcements over electronic equipment ? <p> " Uh , testing ? " she queries the silence , and she hears her own voice clearly enough . <p> Mary untethers and sits up , goes to her door , slides it open . The corridor is empty ; other cabin doors remain closed . Evidently she 's the first to emerge . Gisela 's cabin is only three doors down . <p> Mary knocks , then slides the door open . <p> Gisela 's cabin is empty apart from her personal possessions . <p> Likewise Carmen 's cabin , likewise Denise 's .... <p> All the cabins Mary tries are empty . It seems impossible that everyone can have untethered before her and gone to the bridge to look at the viewscreens , impossible . But what else could they have done ? Mary must have suffered a lapse of consciousness , a gap in awareness . <p> To the bridge , then ! Though without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments and controls untended . Lights glow on boards , equipment purrs . On the viewscreens is the mottled gray of Q-space . No stars , just endless dimensionless frogspawn . Exactly as expected . <p> " Where 's everyone ? Will somebody answer me ! " <p> No answer comes . <p> Has everyone hidden in the rec room or in the hydroponics section to play-a joke on her ... ? She 'll go to the rec ; room and ninety-nine voices will chorus , Boo . Oh really , at this momentous moment , the first entry of the first crewed ship into Q-space ? And why pick on her ? <p> Nevertheless , she does go to the rec room , which is deserted , then to the empty restaurant , then to the botany area where only plants are to be seen . <p> A type of hysterical blindness and deafness is afflicting her - people are here yet she is failing to hear and see them . <p> This has to be nonsense . <p> " Gisela ! Eric ! Yukio ! Com Sherwin ! Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . She is alone on Pioneer . <p> The reason for this mass disappearance must be something to do with the nature of Q-space  --  an effect of the Q-drive as regards conscious intelligences such as human beings . So Mary reasons . <p> Why did Probe 's cameras not show monkeys and rats as missing ? Ah , but the test animals were all caged separately from one another . Conceivably they did not experience the presence of their fellows in the other cages . But they could not report their experience , or lack of it . <p> Can it be that each conscious observer on board the Pioneer has given rise to a copy of the ship , each of which contains only one person ? Right now one hundred copies of the Pioneer are heading through Q-space toward Tau Ceti . When all of these arrive and switch off their drives , will all the copies reintegrate and become once more one single ship with a hundred people aboard it ? <p> Collapse of the wave function ... that 's the phrase , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , as Mary recalls . Surely that stuff happens at the subatomic level , not to an entire ship massing thousands of tonnes . <p> Still , it 's a lifeline to cling to : in six months time everyone will come together . <p> During so many months the hundred ships can hardly remain identical . Mary will consume certain supplies ; absent colleagues will account for different supplies . She remembers the ripple that occurred as she entered Q-space . On emergence , will the merging ships adjust so that there are no discrepancies ? <p> What if two people happen to be in exactly the same place ? Is one of them displaced ? Does that happen gently or violently ? <p> The more she thinks about it , the more iffy the idea of reintegration becomes . <p> THE DESERTED SHIP is subtly menacing . Random noises might be phantom footfalls . A reflection or trick of light and shadow could be a glimpse of someone moving out of sight . Her vanished colleagues may , in their own copies of the ship , be experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the controls . Suppose that a copy  --  ship re-enters normal space prematurely , or is disabled . Reintegration might never be able to occur . Pioneer might fly onward forever . <p> She must n't let this notion obsess her . She has hundreds of years ' worth of food and drink if consumed by one person alone . She sha n't starve ! <p> If each ship is similarly stocked this seems a bit like the miracle of the loaves and fishes . How can reality multiply in such a way ? Maybe Mary 's is the only ship . Maybe only one conscious observer could remain in existence . By sheer chance this happened to be her . <p> No , no , remember all the rats . And all but one of the monkeys . <p> " Talking to yourself , are you , Mary ? " <p> " Nothing wrong with that . People do talk to themselves . That 's how we monitor what 's going on . Helps us plan what to do next . Evolution did n't give us fast random-access memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our self . That 's how we remember things . It reinforces shortterm memory . " <p> " Adults generally talk to themselves silently , not aloud . " <p> " Well , there 's no one around to take offense . There 's just me . " <p> " Just you , eh ? After a while , if you talk aloud to yourself , it 's as if there are two of you - the talker , and the person you talk to . You can become the audience , hearing words which simply seem to emerge . In that case who is doing the talking ? Listen : when we all come together again maybe we might re-enter any of a hundred different universes . " <p> " Surely a star very like Tau Ceti has to be in the same location , otherwise how could we emerge from Q-space ? " <p> " Ah , but maybe we would pick up no ten-year-old radio signals from the solar system , supposing we had a powerful enough receiver . In that other universe the human race may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . Tau Ceti 2 may not be habitable . " <p> " Thanks a bundle . " <p> " Look , why do n't you talk to the computer more ? " <p> " Because the computer only simulates having a mind of its own . That 's why it has no name . A woman 's voice , yes , and a woman 's avatar  --  face if we want one , but no name so we wo n't be fooled . A psychiatrist seeking aid and counsel from a program is absurd . However sophisticated the program is , it can not know . It merely listens and responds as appropriately as possible . After a while , that 's maddening . Ask it how to repair a solar power plant or remind you how to fix a ruptured spleen , fine and good . It goes through its repertoire . If we did have true artificial intelligence , I du n no , maybe there would be some magic quantum link between the AIs in all the ships and we could all communicate . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course she already asked Computer what is happening . Pioneer is transiting through Q-space , Mary . Do you want a full status report ? No , just where is everybody else ? Where is the Commander ? I do n't know , Mary . She may as well ask herself . She does n't wish to confuse Computer . Just take us to where we 're going and carry on with the housekeeping . <p> Playing her favorite arias by Puccini throughout the ship turns out to be a bad idea . The music seems to mask rustlings and whispers . <p> When Mary was sixteen she thought she saw an angel . Most likely she was dazzled by sunlight while hiking through woodland . A tiny lake was a silver mirror , and bushes were covered and linked by innumerable bedewed spiders ' webs . She saw a being with wings , sparkling bright . Of a sudden bird-song seemed to combine in a single rhapsody of musical counterpoint the meaning of which only just eluded her . She felt called . A few centuries earlier she might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatry after earning her medical qualifications . <p> Her parents were both practicing Catholics , who confessed and went to mass regularly . They always denied themselves some treat during Lent  --  generally , in her Dad 's case , drinking with the fellows on a Saturday night . None of the fellows were Catholics , nor was the town a Catholic one  --  her Mom and Dad needed to drive twenty miles to attend mass so Dad had adopted a jokey , ironic front for his faith . " Next year I might give up fast food for Lent . " " Oh we do n't need to worry about what to believe  --  we 're told what to think . " He did good works , quietly , simple kindnesses to neighbors and colleagues . Mary had already begun lapsing into agnosticism by the age of fourteen , and she encountered no pressure or reproach from her parents , but where it came to good works , Dad was a beacon to her . <p> Without the medical attention provided by herself or Gisela or Yukio or Howard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No longer quite six months  --  by now a week of that stretch has passed . Just one damn week ! <p> Personally she 's rather more bothered right now about the hydroponics . Fluids and nutrition are automated , but the care of carrots and tomatoes and bean sprouts is not her field at all . <p> What about Sandy 's pregnancy ? Sandy is on her own , expecting a child , and knowing now that she will have to give birth to it unassisted . What if Sandy develops toxemia ? How will she control that ? What if she suffers a difficult delivery ? What if she can not deliver until reintegration ? <p> How can Sandy be alone if a fetus is growing inside her , four months old by now ? Did the separation-event treat her and her child as one unit  --  or did the event rip the fetus untimely from its mother 's womb , aborting it into yet another copy of the ship , perishing on Sandy 's bedcouch ? This is too awful to contemplate . <p> Something else is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and besides she does n't believe in those . <p> " What are you ? " she cries . " Where are you ? " <p> Armed with a kitchen knife , she ranges around the great doughnut , searching and finding nothing . It 's as though she , the reluctant would-be observer of the Enigma , is always where there 's a low probability of finding whatever it is . Where it is , she is not . She can sense a sort of semi  --  absent presence , never enough for actuality . <p> Is n't there something called an exclusion principle ? <p> " Maybe you should put youself on tranquilizers . " <p> " No , you must stay alert ! " <p> Maybe she arouses the curiosity of whatever it is yet it wants to avoid harming her . Alternatively , it finds her daunting and , although in a sense summoned by her , it keeps out of her way , sniffing and tasting where she has been . <p> " All right , you 've been alone for a fortnight now . Twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods on their own without all the amenities you enjoy ! " <p> Movies , if desired . The hustle and bustle of actors . Any number of computer games . Virtual reality sightseeing , VR adventures . Whatever , whatever . <p> She tried to watch The Sound of Music as a safe choice in the rec room , but she could n't concentrate . She dares not enter a virtual reality  --  the Enigma might creep up on her while she is immersed . <p> " All those people who spent time alone : they still knew that other people existed in the same world as them . I know the contrary ! " <p> " Mary , Mary , how contrary , how does your garden grow ? " <p> " So many bean sprouts already ! Do I harvest them ? I hate bean sprouts . Give me the deluxe meals any day . " More than enough of those to make every day a special occasion . " Why should n't I hog on those ? " <p> " Why not cook something special for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw ingredients in case the vacuum-packed foods somehow fail , or pall . <p> " Since when was I a chef ? It 's stupid cooking for one . " <p> " Cook for me too . " <p> " This sensation of something unseen sharing the ship with me - I ca n't tolerate it for months on end ! " <p> " Even if the sensation may be preferable to total isolation ? " <p> " Show yourself to me ! In a mirror , if you ca n't manage anything more substantial . " <p> And there the Enigma is , in her cabin 's mirror . <p> But it is herself that she sees . <p> Maybe the Enigma is floating directly behind her back , tucked out of sight . Abruptly she shifts aside . Oops , a little surge of nausea . Oh the Enigma is too quick for her by far . <p> She can not catch it full-frontally . She must seek it by indirect means . Mary must practice a sort of Zen art of not-looking , not-seeing . <p> AS A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even practiced a bit in the past . The silent , empty ship is an ideal focus of vacancy . Session by session - interspersed by more mundane tasks  --  she blanks her personality . After each session she surfaces to rediscover herself , the only consciousness hereabouts , a mind amidst a void . <p> Is there a risk that she may remain in tune with the void until her motionless body starves to death ? Grumbling guts recall her to activity  --  so far , at least . <p> After many days of annulling herself .... <p> A perception emerges from the medium through which the Pioneer travels . <p> &lt;&lt;You believe that your identity is confined here in this ship . &gt;&gt; <p> Well yes , she does . <p> &lt;&lt;Fundamental being is forever transforming itself . Think of bubbles in boiling water . Think of flames in a fire . Think of weather cells in an atmosphere . Being is the process , not the particulars . Its facets constantly manifest themselves only to disintegrate and then reintegrate. &gt;&gt; <p> Such is the perception that scrutinizes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue of living flame , which might last for a hundred orbits of your world around your sun , a mere moment of cosmic time . But you are also one facet of a hundred-fold being , the crew of this ship . This hundred-fold being has separated itself from a many  --  billion-fold being  --  which you call Humanity . &gt;&gt; <p> A many-billion-fold being ? <p> &lt;&lt;Humanity from the dawn of consciousness until final demise exists as a four-dimensional blaze of members arising and dying and replacing themselves , all linked , ever loosening , ever relinking , within which flickers your own particular flame . &gt;&gt; <p> Why is she being told this ? Does it help , or is some godlike entity inspecting her coolly ? Alternatively , is she hallucinating ? <p> &lt;&lt;Realize ! From birth to death an intelligent planetary species is a single mental entity , its mentality made of all the minds that compose it . Individual units of Humanity process tiny parts of its totality . Each individual is part of an eon-spanning exchange of information  --  unaware of this except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poetic moments , shamanistic , hallucinatory . You often misinterpret such partial , fleeting glimpses as encounters with Gods or spirits or ghosts or fairies or , more recently , encounters with flying saucer folk . &gt;&gt; <p> " Tell me more . " <p> &lt;&lt;During the millions of years of its existence the species-entity may remain alone . Such beings are few and far between in space and time during any mega-era . Even so , their number is considerable overall , for the present universe was spawned from a parent universe , and in turn gives rise to daughter universes , a great tree of universes. &gt;&gt; <p> This is big stuff . Is she capable of imagining all this on her own ? Quite possibly . Why should a godlike entity bother to communicate with her ? <p> Ah , but an answer comes . <p> &lt;&lt;Some planetary species send parts of themselves through space on a journey lasting generations to the worlds of other stars , creating an offspring of themselves . Some of these offspring encounter an alien species and the two beings either destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A very few planetary species send the exiled part of themselves not through ordinary space but through the underlying space of probabilities  --  and here they encounter its entities , as you do now . <p> &lt;&lt;Your ship is not yet far from its home . You are still entangled . The entity , Humanity , can now be recognized and addressed . And if addressed now , Humanity as a whole is also addressed in the past and in the future . <p> &lt;&lt;Was , is , and will be . &gt;&gt; <p> Mary has had a vision . What is she to make of it ? <p> Is she and is everyone else who ever lived , or who will live , only so many iotas in a single entity spanning millions of years ? By traveling through Q-space , has she encountered a higher entity  --  and caused Humanity to be contacted in the past and the present and the future ? On this , um , higher level of metaconsciousness , to which individual persons only ever have fleeting and partial access at best ? <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship in the future , humanity would probably have remained isolated and uncontacted . Yet because contact occurs now , contact also applies retroactively . Total  --  Humanity may understand this paradox , but it fazes Mary . No individual human being has ever or will ever be aware of more than a jot of the communication between Pan-Humanity and the Probability Entities . This will elude mere people , much as the betting on a tortoise race eludes the tortoises . Or perhaps that should be : a race between fireflies . <p> Mary feels she is like a single brain-cell present during a few moments of a symphony . <p> If the hundred copies of the Pioneer do reintegrate successfully in another five months ' time , and if she announces her revelation , will psychiatrist Mary be for the funny farm ? <p> The air in her cabin smells musty . Surfaces look dusty . <p> Quite nimbly , in the circumstances , she rises from her lotus position . With a fingertip she traces a line across her com-console . <p> God almighty , the date display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + 178 . <p> Q + 178 . <p> A hundred and seventy-eight days , very nearly six months , have passed since the Pioneer entered Q-space and she found herself isolated . Mary has been advanced through time itself . She has been extracted and reinserted later , abridging her lonely journey from months to days . <p> " Oh thank you ! " she cries into the silence . " Thank you so very much ! " <p> Yet now there 's no sense of Another on the ship with her . <p> Full of wonder and gratitude , she sets off to check on hydroponics . What a riot of life and death she finds there  --  rot and fecundity , the air so heady and reeking . Is it possible that Gisela and Eric and all of her colleagues may also have been advanced through time ? <p> Including Sandy , no longer condemned to give birth all alone ? <p> Mary muses , in the dispensary . If the hundred Pilgrims do reintegrate successfully , and if her ninety-nine colleagues have not been blessed as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide quickly in the way of sedatives or stimulants or vitamin supplements ? <p> Of a sudden the warning siren blares automatically , whoop-whoop  --  whoop , such a shocking hullabaloo that her heart races . <p> Thank god for it , though , thank god . She has fifteen minutes to return to her cabin and tether herself . Should she bother to do so , or simply stay here ? If Gisela or Yukio are in this dispensary she might bump into them , disastrously . Her cabin is safer . <p> The cabin writhes , as before . Every surface shimmers . It 's as if her eyes are watering . Then all is clear and sharp again , her photos , her mobile , her terminal . <p> Com Sherwin 's voice comes briskly . " All hear me . Re-emergence from Q-space achieved . Pioneer has acquired Tau Ceti space . " <p> Acquired , acquired ! Pioneer has acquired a whole new solar system . And rejoice , Mary has regained her fellow human beings ! <p> " Tau Ceti 2 is visible at 9.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip and a jump , or the slow way ? <p> " Fellow pioneers , we were all separated - for which there may be various explanations .

Some people may not be able to leave their cabins . How long has Corn Sherwin had to think about contingencies ? <p> " Proceed . Bridge out . " He has not said whether he himself spent months in Q-space  --  or only a single month followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heartfelt greetings . Some tears of relief . <p> " Denise , " Mary calls out , " how long were you in Q-space ? " <p> They embrace . " Oh Mary , it felt like forever ! Six long months . " <p> " Were you alone all that time ? " <p> " Entirely . " <p> " You , Carmen , how long ? " <p> " Six shitting months . I must get to the restaurant , Mary . " <p> " Of course . " <p> Babble , babble as people proceed as instructed . Eric 's cabin is further away around the doughnut out of sight . Be methodical : check inside each cabin even if a door is wide open . There 's Gisela in the distance , opening a door and popping inside . Despite instructions a few people may have shut their doors unthinkingly behind them . Here 's a door that is closed , belonging to : Sandy Tate . Sandy , Sandy ! Mary knocks , calls her name . <p> Freckled , ginger-haired Sandy is sitting on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hugs it to herself protectively . Protectively ?  --  no , it looks more as if Sandy is restraining her baby  --  and it barely a week or two old . <p> " Mary , thank god , I 'm going crazy  --  " <p> " You did give birth ! All on your own  --  that must have been utterly grueling and scary . But you did okay ? " <p> " I managed  --  I read up all I could beforehand . " <p> " Well done , Sandy ! I 'll examine you and your baby as soon as  --  " <p> " Mary , this baby is trying to talk to me ! " <p> " To talk ? " <p> " I do n't understand him , but he 's trying to . " <p> Is Sandy suffering , understandably , from delusions ? <p> " He ca n't talk , Sandy . A baby 's brain is n't fully grown . Learning to speak simply ca n't clock in so soon , and would be totally pointless because it 's physically impossible for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wrong position . For the first nine months the larynx is high up , locked into the nose , so that a baby can drink and breathe at the same time without choking . " <p> " I 'm telling you he 's trying ! I did n't say he can manage it . " <p> The months of loneliness , the fear and worry , the need for another person to communicate with .... <p> " Sandy , you 're misinterpreting the noises he makes . " <p> " I am not misinterpreting . " <p> " Let me see him , Sandy . " <p> As Mary sits on the bed-couch beside her , Sandy flinches . Then she reveals her child , a bundle of feeble struggle which , at presumably blurred sight of a person new to its world , produces sounds that are indeed unlike any regular infantile crying or red-faced bawling . It 's as if a strangled voice , using an unknown language , is heard through distorting filters and muffles . <p> " Sandy , I should tell you something  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell about her own relevation , and her translation through time ? " He does sound different , Sandy , I agree ! At a quick glance there does n't seem to be anything physically wrong with either of you .... Do you think you can get to the restaurant ? " <p> " I 'm his restaurant , " she says . " If he had teeth , he 'd bite . " <p> The baby certainly does seem assertive . <p> " What have you called him ? " Mary asks gently . <p> " He calls me  --  but I do n't know what he wants to say . " <p> " You must have thought of a name beforehand . Boy or girl , whichever . " <p> " James . " <p> " Hi , James . " <p> Those strange noises , as if in reply . <p> " How about bringing him to the restaurant ? I think that 's important . Important , yes . And you need to mingle again . " <p> " Where 's Jeff ? Why is n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ? " <p> " You heard Com Sherwin 's instructions . Jeff will be waiting for you at the restaurant . " <p> " Why did n't he come here so we could both go together ? " <p> " Maybe he expected to find you at the restaurant . Come on , Sandy , chin up . " <p> " I ca n't take my baby there  --  he 's a monster . " <p> Post-natal depression ? Not necessarily . <p> " If James seems a bit odd , Sandy , I might  --  just might  --  know the reason , but I need to explain to all the others too . You 've coped splendidly so far . Come on , it 's okay . " <p> ALL IS NOT quite okay . An American physicist , Greg Fox , is dead . Appendicitis , says Gisela . Must have been agonizing . Did Greg manage to lay his hands on morphine , maybe an overdose ? Post-mortem will tell . He has been dead a couple of months . Unpleasant corpse to find . And one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native language , English now eluding him . How shall Mary cope with him ? With appropriate drugs and with Yukio 's help as translator , she hopes . <p> The assembled crowd , not least Jeff , are delighted to see a baby born on board . People mob Sandy , causing her to hide James from curious eyes . Jeff definitely ought to have gone to her cabin first . Now Sandy seems ambivalent toward him . She feels betrayed by him  --  which he can not understand . Maybe she feels betrayed by what his seed wrought in her . <p> " Listen up , " Com Sherwin calls out to the assembly . " We came through . " And he has maintained his grizzled crewcut between whiles . " We sustained one fatality . Six months ' surprise solitary was tough on us all , right ? " <p> " Wrong , " Mary interrupts . " Not on me . " <p> Sherwin grins ; his blue eyes twinkle . He 's effervescent . " Dr. Nolan , we can not all be psychiatrists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> When she has finished speaking , her colleagues stare at her in a silence that continues for quite a while . <p> " And there 's one other thing , " Mary adds , moving closer to Sandy and child . " Sandy believes that her baby is trying to speak already , and I think she may be right .... " <p> Two bombshells , the second less appreciated than the first , at least to begin with . Has Mary flipped ? is what people are visibly thinking . Eric eyes her with particular concern . <p> " Do you have any hard proof of this ? " Com Sherwin asks . " Not that I 'm doubting what you experienced . Still , it 's a large claim . " <p> " I ca n't prove it , although it 's true . Little James here may throw some light on this , as time goes by , when his larynx shifts . And maybe not . " <p> " Mary , why did n't you tell me this right away ? " <p> " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's complaint , to exonerate himself for not thinking to be with her as soon as possible . <p> " If we could harness this effect  --  " says someone else . Mary ca n't see who . <p> " I do n't know that it 's something we can harness , " she tells whoever . " It was granted to me . " " Granted " sounds a bit messianic . <p> " And to no one else , " she hears . " Why not ? " <p> " Maybe it 's because of the way I meditated . I emptied myself . Then it was able to communicate . " <p> " And to jump you through time . " Resentfully : " Why not us ? Did n't you ask the same on our behalf ? " <p> " I did n't ask it to jump me . I never imagined such a thing was possible . " <p> What Mary has said is at once overwhelming and embarrassing . She 's distanced from everyone else , as sole recipient of a revelation and a boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the shape of James ? <p> " I think for the time being we must take what Dr. Nolan says at face value , " Sherwin declares judiciously . Quite ! Suspicion of lunacy must n't deprive them of a key medical person . " No doubt what Dr. Nolan has told us will fit into context sooner or later . We 'll talk about this at greater length once everything 's less confused . Meanwhile , we should inventory the ship , calculate what we each used and work out how much has come together again  --  try to get a practical handle on what happened . Something measurable . " <p> Of those present , it transpires that only Sherwin himself and Chika and John the climatologist thought to log every last item they used by way of food and drink . <p> " Is that information still in the ship 's memory ? " asks Chika . <p> Indeed , what data is , from a hundred separate journeys , fifty years ' worth of overlapping auto-logs plus whatever data individuals may have entered ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tau Ceti will occupy many weeks hence . <p> The ship 's log contains backup after backup of status data that seem to vary in only minor respects , occupying megabytes of memory . Computer has no explanation for this massive redundancy . It runs diagnostic checks , and megabytes are dumped into cache . Could Computer be in any way compromised by an encounter with Dr. Nolan 's supposed probability-entity ? Apparently not . <p> Eric works overtime putting the hydroponics area to rights . Naturally his own Q-space version was maintained in apple pie order . Sad to see it become so chaotic . <p> " I should have done more , " Mary says ruefully . <p> " Then this would have been two percent tended . It would n't have made a great deal of difference . " <p> " And I did n't know what to do . " <p> " Do you think that announcing your experience straight away was the best course ? " <p> " If I waited longer ... " <p> " ... the more difficult it would become ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to have been contacted by a Higher Entity  --  but I did n't feel like mentioning this until now . Also by the way , I traveled through time . " <p> " You 're probably right . Though now some people are a bit wary of you . " <p> " Does that include you , Eric ? " <p> " Of course not . This must be such a strain for you . " <p> " And you are loyal to your friends . Do you truly believe me ? " <p> " That 's an unfair question , Mary . If I had experienced what you experienced  --  what you undoubtedly experienced .... " <p> " There 's no doubt in my mind , but that 's only my mind . " <p> " Is your experience repeatable  --  I mean , by someone else ? " <p> " We are n't in Q-space any longer . " <p> " On the way back if we all meditate the way you did maybe we can all take a short cut . Or many of us can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start up classes in meditation ? " <p> " Ah ... but we might begin colonizing the second planet , depending on what we find . " <p> If that happens , eventually only the flight crew will return Pioneer to Earth to bring more material and colonists and frozen embryos and such . Mary 's experience may be of no use to the majority of those presently on board . It can be set aside for a long time yet , unconfronted . <p> Offers flood in to time-share James , but Sandy will have none of them . <p> Chika Suzuki gives a lecture on his idea of what may have happened , and how it might be avoided in future if only a starship 's computer itself could be a quantum computer . <p> Sum over Paths . Some Overpaths . <p> " I 'd say we experienced traveling a hundred possible paths between the solar system and Tau Ceti . A myriad other paths got explored at the same time , but since those were absurd we could not experience them . If only we could experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it turned out ! Yet that might have been an experience the individual human mind could n't cope with . All of us experiencing each other 's experience .... " <p> Not everyone wishes to marginalize Mary 's revelation as something at once too huge and too fugitive to contemplate . Dr. Yukio is fascinated . As an insight into a situation where the specialist in afflictions of mind has herself become afflicted ? Chika Suzuki is also enthralled . What Mary says about the multi-million-year mind of all Humanity whenever processing information through its myriad units dead and living and yet unborn  --  this stirs his programmer 's soul , whether he gives her credence or not . Likewise , astrophysicist Denise . And a biologist , Maxim Litvinov . And Sophie Garland , another cybernetics person who is an ordained pastor of the Ecumenical Church . Last but not least - perhaps last yet least as regards stability  --  there is Hiroaki Horiuchi , the chemist who flipped during solitude but who is now responding quite well to mental stabilizers and is coherent in English once again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense he 's a glorified gardener who values neatness and order , nature methodized , not rampant across the eons and imbued with some kind of transcendent mentality , at least as regards the human species . Furthermore , Eric is a no-frills evolutionist . For him life has no goal other than life itself in its many forms during all of its eras . Not that Mary claims that Humanity writ large has any particular goal , yet now that the Higher Entity has intervened  --  retrospectively as well as in the now and in the henceforth !  --  it certainly seems as if some kind of destiny is implied , or at least an upgrade to a higher level of existence or state of awareness . <p> Mary 's supporters hold study sessions with her , and Hiro 's presence seems therapeutic for him . Exploring Mary 's experience helps Hiro come to terms with his own phantoms and demons  --  though he might be imprinting on Mary emotionally , as his sensei of sanity , or the opposite . <p> Three of Mary 's co-explorers are Japanese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves as a unique collective entity , so they can empathize with the concept of Overlife , Pan-being , or whatever . <p> The interest of these six does indeed support Mary , otherwise she might be as lonely now as she was during those initial weeks of isolation in Q-space  --  she might be the specter at the feast of renewed companionship . Even so , sometimes she feels like screaming out to the entity that shifted her through time , Come back ! Please show yourself to more than merely me ! <p> Meanwhile , Sandy puts a brave face on being mother to a baby , who is evidently abnormal , although bursting with health . It 's as though a perfectly normal baby has been overwritten by a program that can not yet run in him  --  not until he matures a bit more  --  yet which nevertheless keeps trying to express itself , and testing its environment ... maybe modifying its environment as it does so , tweaking developmental pathways ? Jeff does his best to help nurture their son , frequently taking James off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rec room . Just as he ought to . Fair dooze , sport . No other couples have yet conceived . Potential parents are awaiting what James may become . <p> WEEKS LATER , Pioneer enters orbit around Tau Ceti 2 , eighty kilometers above what is basically a world-ocean girding half a dozen scattered and mottled distorted Australias , all but one of them situated in the temperate zones . The odd one out straddles the north pole and wears an ice cap . River systems are visible , and mountains , one of which is smoking vigorously , an eruption in progress . Elsewhere , a typhoon is blowing . The planet seems lively ; not overly so , it 's to be hoped . The signatures of vegetation are down below , so at least there is botany . Where there is botany , zoology too ? Very likely marine biology at least , but no moon pulls any tides ashore . <p> After three weeks of intensive global survey work Jay-Jay will pilot Shuttle One , Beauty , down to the land mass already dubbed Pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of names suggested by all personnel and okayed by Com Sherwin . In time , hopefully , people will be able to feed upon Pizza if its soil proves amenable . Accompanying pilot-geologist Jay-Jay will be Maxim Litvinov , Jeff Lee , and John Dolby , representing life sciences and climate . <p> To gaze upon an alien world , from the bridge or onscreen , is riveting . Those warped Australias are like presents under the Christmas tree . What exactly is in them ? What is the topping on Pizza ? <p> The answer , three weeks later , proves to be weed - thongs , tangles , ribbons , bladders , variously jade-green and rusty-red , bright orange and emerald in the light of Tau Ceti . Suited and helmeted , Maxim describes the scene that is onscreen everywhere throughout Pioneer . ( The three passengers on Beauty had tossed the only coins within light years for the honor of being first-foot on the new world . Pilot excluded . Must n't risk him . ) Beauty rests upright on an apron of flat rock amidst assorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain that has been emptied of its water . The actual shore is a couple of kilometers away . Should n't be hard to hike there . Some of the weed piles a meter deep but whole stretches are as flat as a pancake . <p> Cautiously Maxim pokes around with a probe . Amidst a larger mass of weed he soon comes across a number of little hoppers and scuttlers - " they 're a bit like fleas and tiny crabs - " and even captures some specimens , before he cuts samples of weed , then bags soil that is variously gritty and sludgy , inhabited by some wriggly tendrils and purple mites . <p> John descends from Beauty to join Maxim , carrying an atmosphere analyzer to confirm orbital readings . This done , Jeff comes bearing a white mouse in a transparent light-weight habitat . Mice are biologically very similar to men . Will the mouse , Litmus , turn virulently red or blue because of hostile microorganisms ? Even if nothing obvious happens , in another few days once back on Pioneer Litmus will be sacrificed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vicinity , next day Maxim and Jeff set off for the seaside under gray clouds . Rain will move in later , though nothing torrential . What will they find ? Leviathans cruising offshore like mobile islands ? Torpedos with flippers and goggly eyes nursing pups on the beach ? <p> No . No . <p> " Weed and sand . Pebbles and boulders . " As is seen onscreen while Maxim pans his camera . <p> Some great thongs of weed emerge from the breeze-rippled sea , right across the shore and beyond , like vast creepers that the ocean has rooted upon the land . No wildlife bigger than hoppers and scuttlers and sliders , and nothing in the empty and now melancholy sky . <p> Presently Jeff fires nets into the sea , one to trawl , the other weighted to dredge . What comes back are floaters and wrigglers and squirmers , none bigger than a little finger . <p> Back on Beauty in its resealed habitat Litmus the mouse is still perky and white . <p> The day after , Shuttle Two , Charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley on the huge island or mini-continent christened Kansas , somewhat further inland than Beauty landed . Weed webs its way from the river over the terrain , yielding to flexible dwarf ribbon-trees and inflated lung-plants . More little hoppers and scuttlers and variations , nothing big . <p> All in all this is wonderful , if a bit bleak . Here on Tee-Cee , as the planet is coming to be called , is an ecology , primitive but functional . Years ago it was decided that biological contamination of the Tee-Cee environment is of much less consequence than the chance of inhabiting a whole new world , if at all possible . After all , the expedition had cost its partners upward of forty billion dollars . Agronomy experiments get under way , a range of seedlings transplanted directly into the local soil and also into heat-sterilized grit and sludge under protection . <p> All of this rather puts Mary 's revelation and baby James to the back of people 's minds , except for the members of the support group consisting of Yukio , Chika , Denise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James in a head-supportive carry-sling . Jeff being down on the surface has robbed her of his help , an unavoidable repeat of his earlier failure to be present . And there 's Eric too , although in his case simply out of loyalty . But no Maxim . He 's on the surface of Tee-Cee . The eight  --  or nine , if James is counted  --  meet in the hydroponics section , like conspirators or members of a cult . Maybe their infant messiah is in their midst , albeit inarticulate as yet . <p> " We are each other , " says Hiroaki . " That is the meaning . The unity of all human life . " <p> Sophie asks him gently , " Were Adolf Hitler and a rabbi in an extermination camp united ? What about people waging ruthless war on each other throughout history ? " <p> " If our immune system goes wrong , it can attack our own bodies . But I am talking about lives going way back and stretching far ahead . I am my ancestor and my distant descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Pan-Humanity already includes those future lives . " <p> " Future lives have n't yet been lived ! " protests Denise . " If we could dip into them now , why , everything is fixed in advance unalterably . It would only be because of our blindness to the future that we bother to do anything at all in the present . No , wait : we could n't even choose to do , or not to do , something if all is foreordained . Pan-Humanity ca n't be calculating or thinking or dreaming or doing whatever it does across the millennia unless genuine changes happen within it ! Otherwise it would be just one big super-complicated thought , a four-dimensional abacus forever in the same state . " <p> " What is its purpose ? " asks Mary . " What does it do , what does it dream ? " <p> " Maybe it merely exists , " says Eric . " Maybe that 's all it does . " <p> " Surely it must come to conclusions . The computing power it has ! Using all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Final extinction is conclusion enough . The tree grows , the tree dies . " <p> " Maybe , " suggests Chika , " it avoids extinction by being closed in upon itself . Its end and its beginning join together . So it always exists , even though time moves on beyond the epoch of its physical existence . " <p> " Contacting the probability-being must have caused a change  --  " <p> " As soon as this happened , it had already happened long ago too  --  " <p> " We do n't have the minds to understand this  --  " <p> " Only the overmind possesses the overview  --  " <p> " It must understand existence . Not just experience existence , but understand as well  --  as part of its process of existing  --  " <p> " We are all part of God , " Sophie declares . " Any highly evolved species is a God in total . Yet we can not follow God 's thoughts . All of us are just little bits of those thoughts . " <p> " The probability-being was a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of it , Mary . Because you were its modem to our God , our species . It had to exchange signals through you . " <p> " And then it went away , because chatting to me was probably as interesting as talking to an ant . " <p> " At least it lifted you from one end of the branch to the other . " <p> " So effortlessly . If only our God would do the same for us . " <p> " Maybe , " Sophie suggests , " you should pray real strongly , Mary . Sort of meditation with a punch to it . " <p> " What should I pray for ? " <p> " For James , " says Sandy . " Let him be  --  " <p> "  --  normal ? " asks Sophie . " Or gifted with tongues , real soon ? So that the babe begins to speak instead of just garbling at you ? " <p> " I think ... normal . " <p> " Normal would be a waste , do n't you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be down there ? " <p> " It 's why we 're here . " <p> " Let me take James off your hands for a few hours , " offers Sophie , not for the first time . <p> " No .... " Only Jeff is permitted to share her baby , because it is his duty to . <p> Whatever happens , Sandy seems very unlikely to harm her baby . If she does so in any way , then that is Mary 's responsibility . Mary feels she can not intervene too intrusively , having , as it were , a vested interest . <p> Some of the seedlings fail , but most survive , even quite a few of those which are fully exposed to the Pizza environment . Some even thrive . Monitor cameras record efforts by hoppers to snack , and one definite quick fatality , although most nibblers quickly hop away into weed . In a bottle of formaldehyde the dead hopper is an amulet of hope . Perhaps . Supposing that hope equates with the superiority , or at least resilience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauty returns to Pioneer . Time for intensive lab work , and confirmation of results by Computer . <p> Many tests have been performed , many protocols faithfully obeyed , but there comes a time when a volunteer must personally dip his toe into the bathwater . In the middle of Kansas , Jeff removes his helmet . Computer has approved , although approval is merely advisory . Despite Jeff 's best efforts at child-sharing , maybe he is betraying Sandy yet again by being a hero . <p> The supporters ' group join hands in hydroponics and pray for Jeff , even though by now they remember that they are perhaps no longer part of the processes of humanity , being altogether too far away . <p> " It smells sort of sweet .. and sort of musty too , a bit like rotting wood . " <p> Jeff breathes for five minutes . No sudden sneezes . Resuming the helmet , he wears it inside Charm for three boring hours . Nothing untoward happens to him , so he unsuits . Saliva and mucous swabs and a blood sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We appear to be lucking out in a big way , " Com Sherwin tells everyone . <p> Charm is the ideal isolated quarantine facility . Jeff and Gisela and tubby agronomist Marcel Reynard and pilot-geologist Werner Schmidt take turns working and exploring outside fully suited . Aboard Charm Gisela mixes a fecal sample with a sample of local soil and organisms ; some of the organisms die . After a week Jeff ventures outside to breathe the air of Kansas for several hours . <p> Three days later Jeff drinks boiled , filtered Kansas water . Gisela tests and retests his urine . Two days afterward , he is wearing a coverall rather than a suit when outside . Ungloved , he has already handled samples of vegetation inside the shuttle , and no rashes resulted . Now he handles living vegetation . On the soil he deposits a fecal sample he brought in a bag , marking the spot with a day-glo flag . What may the hoppers and scuttlers and sliders make of this offering if they had any glimmering of true consciousness rather than mere programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have descended from the sky . Next day , inert hoppers and sliders lie nearby  --  the food of the Gods , or rather the waste products , were too much for them . <p> James 's developmental pathways must indeed have altered ; his larynx is descending early . Beware of the risk of him choking . Connections in his brain may be proceeding more rapidly  --  he looks alert , bright-eyed , on the verge of what exactly ? No longer does he attempt in vain to vocalize , as if he has come to some understanding with himself , or of himself . What a patient , amenable baby he is now , and still so young . He stares at his mother , and at Mary too , and at the members of the supporters ' club , which is his supporters ' club as much as it is Mary 's . <p> The third shuttle , Color , has gone down to join Charm , to erect a habitat-dome for thirty persons along with a solar power plant and a number of wind-power whirlies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appre-. ciate the full implications of a whole future spent on Tee-Cee . Sure , there will be much scientific stimulation . Sure , there will be a wealth of human cultural resources on tap for entertainment . Sure , more colonists will arrive from Earth within , say , two years at the most , counting in time for mission assessment and the turn-around of Pioneer . But oh , the comparative barrenness of Kansas ... ! <p> " If we go down there ... , " says Sandy . <p> " Not if , but when , " says Chika . " We did n't actually think this would happen , did we ? I confess I did n't , not in my heart . The planet would n't be habitable , or there would be alien viruses we could n't cope with . But it is , and there are n't . " <p> Sophie tries to sound a bright note . " In another hundred years there will he human cities . Networks . People whose grandparents were born on Tee-Cee Two . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work work . A few days ' hike in any direction for a working holiday if we 're lucky . Lots of trips to the seaside for me . We 'll be sacrificing the best of our lives . " <p> " That 's why we came here , " says Mary . " We 're pioneers . Your Jeff especially . " <p> " Easy for you to say ! You wo n't be stuck here . Com Sherwin is bound to take you back through Q-space in the hope of a shortcut through time for anyone aboard . If that ca n't be cracked , is n't six months ' solitary going to be a bit of a disincentive to those who 'll supposedly follow us ? Well , is n't it ? " <p> " Do you mean ... you think there might never be another shipload of colonists ? Surely not ! Even if people are obliged to endure isolation en route , they 'll still come . At least they 'll know they have a secure destination ! " <p> Eric eyes Mary uneasily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have expected to go back to look after the hydroponics , but there ca n't be much point if there are eight or so different versions of Pioneer . Com Sherwin is almost bound to take you as ship 's doctor rather than Yukio . " <p> " Even if I have nobody to doctor but myself ? Talk sense . " <p> Eric nods . " Because of your other possibility . " <p> The Commander must be haunted by decisions he has yet to make . Maybe this is why , after a long and inconclusive interview with Mary months ago , he has not discussed her revelation again with her in any depth . Something new may yet happen to her . Or if not her , then as regards baby James . <p> DENISE HAS GONE to the surface . From now on her astrophysics will be restricted to the close study of Tau Ceti , which is important , of course . Sunspot cycles , the wind from the new sun . Jay-Jay has deployed an instrument platform in orbit for her to uplink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time . <p> It 'll be another month until a second habitat-dome is erected , and several more whirlies , time enough one hopes for any teething problems with the first habitat to become apparent . Since a habitat does not need to be sealed off fully from the environment , problems should not be too serious . The air and the water freely available down on Tee-Cee Two are such a boon , as is the soil in which crops can grow . Genetic engineering may not be necessary at all . Unprotected fields of lupins may provide fodder , and some beauty . Frozen embryos of pigs , goats , and rabbits may be quickened and brought to term in the artificial wombs all the sooner . And chickens hatched . And ponds dug for carp and trout and a network of irrigation channels . <p> James will have chicks and bunnies and piglets as part of his nursery experience . <p> The pioneers were prepared to provide full protection to the tithe of terrestrial life they brought with them . This would have limited the options . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony of thanks and blessing , although God is absent , or at least extremely diminutive , if God is the collective superconsciousness of the whole human race . <p> A husband and wife team , Bjorn and Heidi Svenson , vets who will be in charge of husbandry , visit Mary in the clinic . Heidi has brought a urine sample . <p> " You 're pregnant . Definitely ! " Mary tells Heidi joyfully . " Oh , congratulations ! " Turns out to be only a week ago that the Svensons engaged in something of a marathon , six times in two days at mid-month in Heidi 's cycle . If James was ever a jinx , that jinx is exorcised now that Tee-Cee promises fertility . In place of a certain apprehension is an eagerness to bear the first child on an alien world . It 's early days yet to be sure how viable the Svensons ' embryo is , but Heidi does not intend to keep quiet about it . Next day , another husband and wife and a pair of Afro-American partners visit Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the latter have succeeded . With luck James will have peers not too much younger than he is . <p> Mary and Sophie and Hiroaki and Chika , and inevitably Eric , are taking a coffee break in hydroponics , perching on the sides of plant  --  troughs , their backs brushing the emerald foliage of carrots and the stalks of tomato plants bowed by bright red globelets . <p> Sandy comes in at a pace that risks balance-nausea , James swaddled tightly in her arms as if he might fall and break . <p> " He started speaking  --  ! " She displays her child , who gazes at Sophie , then at Mary . <p> What the baby says is : " I am a Voice . I answer . Ask me . " <p> And Mary asks , " What are you ? " <p> " I am a Voice of the linking to All-Humanity . The echo of the event in what you call Q-space . I am a Voice left behind . " Sandy 's baby is actually talking to them . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind ? " <p> " As a Guide to what is and what may be . " <p> " Should n't we get the Commander here ? " butts in Eric . <p> " Not yet , not yet , " says Hiroaki , eager for enlightenment . <p> A Guide to what is .... <p> " Do you mean , " Eric asks , " you can tell us , for example , whether TeeCee is as suitable for us to colonize as it seems to be ? " <p> " Maybe the problems are within yourselves . You are all too special . Specialists , multi-specialists . Over-endowment oozes from your fingertips , from the pores of your skin . Better to have sent here a hundred trained peasants or low-caste laborers for whom the work would mean freedom from the restricting past and who would feel like lords . Tee-Cee is weed , water , dirt . Compel a chess grand master to play nothing but checkers for years . " <p> " Pioneer will bring more people here in a couple of years  --  fewer Ph.D.s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sleeping two to a cabin , like animals in an ark ? Will you first founders be their superiors , their directors ? Even so , the numbers will still be too small . " <p> " Another ship will be built  --  more ships . " <p> " Requiring four years each , costing forty billion moneys each ? Almost bankrupting the backers ? Shall the Earth be taxed dry ? Only so , if threatened by certain extinction . If your sun is about to flare . If a dark star enters your solar system . If a big comet passes by and will return in a hundred years and strike your Earth . " <p> " We could fire anti-matter at a comet , " says Chika . " Completely destroy it while it 's still far away . " <p> Within such a short time-frame what threat could be big enough and certain enough ? <p> Mary recalls . " You  --  or the being you represent  --  told me that otherspecies do manage to set up colonies by sending generation ships or whatever . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps those species command a much larger energy budget than Humanity . You may be too soon . Premature . Your best effort , not big enough . " <p> " I think , " says Sophie , " you 're looking on the gloomy side . You 've been overhearing people having a few last-minute doubts . " <p> A guide to what may be .... <p> " James , can you foretell the future ? " asks Hiroaki . <p> " I can tell what may most probably be , " answers the baby . " The most probable paths . Sometime , within infinity , an improbable path becomes actual . How else could the first parent universe arise ? " <p> " Oh kami kami kami , " Chika exclaims , " he 's a quantum computer . A hand-held quantum computer  --  and he 's an artificial intelligence too ! No , I do n't mean artificial  --  he 's biological , a biological quantum computer . Of course that 's what we all are in a limited sense if it 's true that quantum effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ... we are n't linked ... we are n't directly plugged in to the background , the big picture .... " <p> " What he is , " says Sophie , " is an avatar . " <p> " You mean like the face Computer has , if we want to see a face onscreen ? " <p> " Originally avatar is a Hindu term . For an incarnation of a god , a manifestation . " <p> How cautiously Sandy holds on to what is biologically her son , as though maybe she should lay him down among the tomato plants in case her grasp fails her . <p> " Does he have powers ? Can he make things happen ? " <p> " Ask him , " says Sophie , compassionate , apprehensive . Sandy bows her head over her baby . <p> " James , can you do things ? Can you ... can you make a bird appear in here ? " <p> " Mother , I am a Voice , not a Hand that can pluck a creature from one place to another . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do . " Carefully she unswaddles a chubby pink baby arm , little fingers , tiny coral nails . <p> " But I am not a Hand . " <p> " Could you become a Hand ? " <p> " That is a very unlikely path . Then I might not be a Voice . " <p> " Can you see what is happening with Jeff there down on Tau-Cee ? " <p> " I am not an Eye . " <p> Hiroaki interrupts . " Are there any other beings like you that are Hands or Eyes ? " <p> James yawns . " I am tired now . This was an effort . I am a baby . " His eyes close . <p> " I got to get a message to Jeff ! He must come back ! " <p> " We got to tell the Commander right now , " says Chika . <p> " He 's asleep . " <p> " Com Sherwin ? How do you know ? " <p> " No . James is asleep . " <p> Sherwin Peterson quickly comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you wake him up ? " <p> " I do n't think we should , " says Mary . " He 's fatigued . Let him wake in his own time . " <p> " I can hardly doubt the word of five of you .... " <p> Not unless this is some weird hoax , and what would that serve ? The Commander bangs his fist into his palm as if the sudden noise might startle James awake . <p> " Let me get this straight . He 's saying that this expedition is too soon and too few and the wrong sort of people . " <p> That might be the point of the hoax , is a thought which obviously crosses his mind . Psychological sabotage by a small group of conspirators who wish to avoid effectively being marooned down on Tee-Cee . This feeling might spread like an infection . Let 's just do the science , then let 's pack up and go home in relative comfort . If the baby wakes up and says nothing at all the hoax will be rumbled within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , mutiny might still have been sown . <p> " I am ordering you to say nothing about this until I can talk to the baby myself . " <p> How can he enforce his order ? A Commander should not issue orders that can not be enforced . <p> " I 'm appealing to you to keep quiet for a few hours . How long will it be ? " A mother should know . And a doctor should know . Oh yes really , a psychiatrist who claims she met an inhabitant of probability , whose voice this baby now is ? <p> " His brain is altered , " Mary says . " I do n't know how long he needs to sleep after making a big effort . We might harm him . " <p> " This could harm us , Doctor , in ways you might n't imagine ! " <p> " He 's a living quantum computer , " says Chika . " Maybe James can help you pass through Q-space again without the same isolation . Maybe he can pull the time-jumping trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the universe . This ship vanishes , and that 's the end of star travel . How do you know this baby is n't some sort of virus that Dr. Nolan 's famous super-being inserted on board ? Better the devil of isolation than a devil we do n't know . " <p> Paranoia due to the strain of command ? The weight of responsibility for human hopes and for forty billion dollars . <p> " I think we 'll have ample time to find out , " says Chika . <p> The Commander squares himself . " We 'll all wait . Right here . " <p> " I have work to attend to , Commander . " <p> " What would that be ? Reprogramming the computer to accept input from the virus-baby ? " <p> " Of course not . There 's a lot of data from the surface to process . " <p> " No one leaves , and no one enters . Make yourselves comfortable . " True to his word , the Commander parks his butt on the edge of the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bites into it , sticks his other hand in his pocket . <p> " James should be lying on my bed , " says Sandy . " Wait here ? He 's abit of a weight . Look , I 'll take him to my cabin . I guess we can all fit in there . And that 'll be more private . " <p> " I said we wait here . " <p> " Com , that 's unreasonable . " <p> " In your professional opinion is it lacking in reason ? " Sherwin asks Mary . " A sign of insanity ? Sufficient grounds for my Second Officer to take over ? " <p> From his pocket , to their astonishment , the Commander pulls a pistol , which he points at Sandy - or at James . <p> Tightly Sophie says , " I did n't know there were any weapons on Pioneer . " <p> " Sure there are . And on the shuttles too . Kept well out of sight , locked away , available in emergency to certain personnel who are sworn to secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What if a hostile alien entity boards the ship ? What if that has happened already ? " <p> It is as if a trapdoor has opened , from which blows a very cold draft . <p> Com Sherwin chews and sucks at the tomato , and regards the five , and slumbering James . Hiroaki is standing tensely as if calculating whether he can disarm Sherwin . <p> " Commander , " says Mary , " if you put the gun away we agree to stay here and never say anything about this . There might be an accident . " <p> " My child , " whispers Sandy . <p> " Ah but is he or ai n't he ? How much of him is your child if his brain has been tampered with , as you say ? Is he even human if he 's actually a bio-computer ? Some guns came along with us in case of unforeseen emergency . I think this amounts to something of an emergency putting the mission in peril , admittedly in a peculiar way . I would like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite wrong about us being unsuitable settlers . " <p> " In that case , Dr. Nolan , would I let it have a say in how this ship operates in Q-space ? As you have just suggested , Dr. Suzuki . " <p> " He may have powers , " Sandy says . <p> " That 's exactly what I 'm bothered about . You people really are blind . Indulged . Let 's be patient , let 's not leap to conclusions , let 's keep hush . I 'm the Commander . Some weird baby is n't . " <p> THIS IS ALL very unfortunate . Com Sherwin had seemed steady as a rock . An easy-going rock , you might even say . Ten light years distance from Earth is a long thin thread . Thin threads can snap if tugged unexpectedly . He still sounds composed . Does he not understand that producing a gun to enforce authority seriously devalues his position as well as poisoning the atmosphere aboard ? A gun , to confront a mother and baby . He is like a King Herod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his scope . <p> " Whatever happens , " Mary tells the others , " we must n't say anything about this . Understood ? This is a can of worms . " Can she persuade the Commander to accept counseling ? <p> " Perhaps , " suggests Sophie , " I should say a prayer to focus us . " <p> No one else wanders into hydroponics . If someone did , would Com Sherwin detain them too at gun point ? He whistles to himself monotonously and tunelessly , as if time-keeping , holding the pistol slackly . Occasionally he answers a message on his com . He eats a couple more tomatoes to sustain himself , a breech of proper conduct  --  hydroponics is not for anyone to sneak into and snack  --  but in the circumstances Eric does not demur . <p> Mary thinks of Commander Bligh and the Bounty . And of isolated Pitcairn Island , where the mutineers marooned themselves , not to be recontacted until many decades later , while Bligh and his few rowed something like four thousand miles by dead reckoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey , almost equivalent to the crossing of light years . In this case is the Commander the mutineer ? On the Pitcairn Island of Tee-Cee does he maroon his crew while the officers make their escape ? <p> By his own lights the Commander may be right to be holding that gun , in case James is a lot more than they imagine . In case James needs to be killed quickly . <p> Err on the safe side . <p> After an hour James wakes . With his gun the Commander motions all but Sandy and her baby well out of the way . Hiroaki especially . <p> " Hi there , Kid , I 'm the Commander . I hear you found your voice . That true ? " <p> " I am the Voice , Commander . " <p> " I 'm kind of upset to hear you cast doubts on our chances of settling Tee-Cee . " <p> The baby peers at him , focusing . " I am realistic . Too few , too soon , too concerned with individuality . " <p> " Pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Earth 's only chance of having our eggs in more than one basket . Question of available resources and politics . " <p> " So you feel obliged to try to succeed . " <p> " Obliged , right . Now what 's your agenda ? Try to dissuade us ? Something important about Tee-Cee ? In a squillion years might the weed  --  hoppers amount to more than Einstein and Hawking and Mozart ? That it ? " <p> " What are Einstein and Hawking and Mozart ? " <p> " I guess their fame has n't spread much . We aim to remedy that . Any advice about Q-space ? How to keep us all together while we 're in transit through your realm ? How to speed things up a bit ? " <p> " Would you prefer that a hundred different journeys are undertaken by everyone ? And only one actuality emerges ? The wave fronts of all the other ships collapsing , experienced subjectively as catastrophe , shipwreck in void , the dissolving of substance and life ? " <p> " You could fix that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Q-drive controls ? Excuse my being confrontational , by the way . Commander 's prerogative if a mission seems in danger . " <p> " There are ways to arrange different parameters . " <p> " I guess no one would ever take another Q-space trip if there 's a ninety-nine percent likelihood of being annihilated . " <p> " The one percent that prevails becomes one hundred percent . Nothing is actually lost . " <p> " Except that ninety-nine me 's experience termination . " <p> " You , who prevail , would not know . " <p> " Okay , I 'll take that on board , under advisement . Would n't ninetynine or whatever number of you go down kicking and screaming also , in ghost-land ? " <p> " Unimportant . Inessential . The survivor survives . Result : unity . You overvalue the idea of the self . " <p> " There 's a real cosmic perspective . Dr. Tate , lay the child down by those carrots , will you ? " <p> " Why should I do that ? What 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Muchos thoughts . Kindly do it now . " <p> " I wo n't . You 're mad . " <p> The gun points . " Do it , and nothing bad will happen to you . " <p> " Not to me , but .... " <p> " I 'll count to five . At five I pull the trigger . " <p> With greatest reluctance Sandy unslings James . <p> " Position him so he can see me . Now , back off . " <p> She backs off a pace , another pace . She 's tempted to throw herself in between . <p> " Okay . Voice , can you see me clearly ? " <p> " Yes , " says the baby . <p> " Do you know what this is I 'm holding in my hand ? " <p> " A tool that I think can kill . " <p> " Exactly . It fires a bit of metal called a bullet , very fast with a lot of punch . I 'm pointing it at your head , which contains your brains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count to five and then I 'm going to fire . " <p> " Do n't do this , " begs Sandy . " He needs feeding and changing . " <p> " Should we have a short intermission ? No , I do n't think so . " Sherwin starts to count . James stares at him , neither begging nor flinching . When Sherwin reaches five , he pulls the trigger . <p> Click . <p> " Gee , the safety is on .... " And immediately , " Now it is n't . But the test is over . He 's just a Voice , that 's all . Unless he 's telepathic , of course , but he gave no signs so far . All right , all relax . I 'm sorry about this bit of theater . Had to be sure he does n't have powers . " <p> " And what , " asks Sophie , " if he had vanished the gun from your hand ? Sent it into the middle of nowhere ? What would you have done then , try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Been very circumspect . I sincerely apologize , people . Middle of nowhere is where we are , or rather at the other end of nowhere , and that 's where he comes out of , even if he looks like a baby and poos like a baby , a very disarming disguise . I had to be certain what we 're dealing with . Exceptional circumstances call for exceptional reactions . What to ordinary souls may appear to be an irrational reaction , right out of left field , may be inspired and correct . " <p> " A commander has to be decisive , " agrees Chika politely . <p> " I was quoting Linda Bernstein . This brings us back to the problem of damage to morale , and what if anything we might do about rejigging the Q-drive . " <p> " You 're actually entertaining the idea ? " <p> " How can I ignore it , Dr. Suzuki ? I 'm not blinkered . " <p> No , but maybe he is on the edge of himself . <p> " I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least at present . " <p> " You were justified , " says James . Healingly , perhaps . Or shrewdly . <p> The Commander tucks his pistol away . <p> " Okay , Voice , these different parameters that can be arranged ... can our ship 's personnel all skip ahead through time on the trip back to Earth if we put up with a bit of isolation ? Without most versions of us getting extinguished ? " <p> What a gift to science and star travel this will be . And how much more supportive for the settlement on Tee-Cee . Beats harpooning a gas-whale into a cocked hat . <p> " I am tired again , " says the baby . <p> " Sandy . " Bonhomie , now . " For the moment I want you to keep the Voice out of the way of everyone other than those here present . Will you promise this ? " <p> Of course . <p> The Commander orders Charm to carry a final habitat down to Kansas , and a load of supplies . Beauty conveys another thirty settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proportionately huger , so it seems . The six , and James , remain aboard as though they are engaged in a covert project . Which of them will be sent down at the last moment ? Sherwin must at least already have confided in his Second Officer . He is abridging any planned schedule effervescently . A year at Tau Ceti and all the planetary science work ? No , the stay in orbit will be measured in months , maybe as few as two , as though Sherwin is now itching to depart , the sooner to return bringing more settlers and equipment . Colonization is the prime priority . This is proceeding more successfully and speedily than anyone had expected - just so long as no one involved in it hears of the Voice 's doubts , not for a long while yet . Colonization must be buttressed , reinforced , ASAP . The toehold must become a full deep footprint . <p> Jeff still does not know about his son 's achievement . Jeff is distant now . Undoubtedly Sandy will stay aboard Pioneer to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to wait . <p> Conversations with the Voice continue , in Sandy 's cabin . Sophie or Mary frequently stay with James to let Sandy off the leash for exercise and a change of scene , as now . Chika and Hiroaki are also helping baby-sit . The bed-couch is crowded . <p> " So we are all tiny parts of a vast species-overmind ? " <p> " Yes , Mary , " says James . <p> " What does the overmind do ? What is its aim ? What thoughts does it think ? " <p> " I do not have access to it . I am only the Voice of the Other , left behind . " <p> " Is there any way a person can access our species-overmind directly and comprehensibly ? " <p> Mary thinks of the angel she once saw . The angel was cobwebs and dew and sunlight . <p> " Being enfolded into its psychospace and becoming fully aware : that is a way . " <p> " What does that mean ? " <p> " Ceasing your life in ongoing space-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded in its wholeness . Like true dreams . Can you awake lucidly within the dream that was your life , once it has ended ? Can you edit the life that was yours ? Can you rewrite it ? Can you corrupt the data of your history recorded in the psychosphere ? This may compel the attention of the overmind . " <p> " Could you help me do this ? " asks Mary . <p> " Perhaps . " <p> " He 's talking about you dying first ! " says Sophie . " He is n't saying that you can report anything at all to the living . " <p> " I am talking , " says the Voice , " about myself ceasing along with you after I help hoist your mind . " <p> " Hoist my mind ? How ? " <p> " I can hypnotize you and , as it were , change mental settings . " <p> " Good thing Com Sherwin is n't hearing this , " Sophie says . " But anyway , we 're only talking theoretically . Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would volunteer for this , " Chika says softly . <p> " Only Mary Nolan is suitable , " the Voice states , " because her mind already linked in Q-space . And a gap was caused . She went ahead in time . " <p> " Oh , kami kami , " murmurs Chika . <p> " If I can edit my life-data after I die , " asks Mary , " do I alter the real events that occurred ? " <p> " Skeins may unravel and reform , within limitations . Threads will shift . A different probability will manifest . The large pattern will remain similar . " <p> " It is like time-travel , is n't it ? A sort of time-travel ? I go back and I do something a bit differently . " <p> " You adjust what already happened and what resulted . Within limits . " <p> " And if the overmind does not agree ? " <p> " It must focus upon you . You who are part of it . " <p> " Can I focus it upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know this . My brain heats . I am tired . I must cool . " <p> The final shuttle trips come so soon . Pioneer almost empties its stores of supplies . Chika and Yukio , Sophie and Hiroaki are to become settlers . <p> Hiroaki hangs himself in his cabin . In the partial gravity his strangulation may have taken a while , and perhaps this was his plan  --  to approach death more slowly so that the boundary between life and death might become as blurred as his vision , allowing him to slip through , to be both dead and alive at once for a while so that he might enfold into psychospace while still fractionally aware . He too was touched by what transpired in Q-space . To a certain extent Hiroaki 's mental settings had been changed . Or perhaps he could not bear to be exiled on Tee-Cee , away from the Voice , or from Mary who may attain a kind of satori , if not in this life then in the data-dream-stream of her life , the eddies within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death is a shock . Still : balance of his mind tragically disturbed ever since isolation in Q-space . After a brief service conducted by Sophie , his body joins that of Greg Fox in cold store . Sending bodies down to be buried on Tee-Cee would not be a good omen . <p> " What did the Voice tell him ? " Com Sherwin wants to know . Has to be something to do with James . <p> Mary confesses to the Commander . " I think Hiroaki got the idea that he might be able to contact the overmind by dying , because he was touched by it in Q-space . " <p> " Touched , as in loony ... ? " <p> " Maybe he could n't bear to be separated from .... " <p> " From his therapist ? " <p> " No , from what may happen in Q-space the next time . " <p> Pioneer is outward bound . Farewells have been said . In an entirely literal way : fare extremely well .. until the starship returns . Which it will , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charm has been left in Kansas , almost like an emergency survival hut that can be sealed off , though of course will never need to be . Or like an escape route , admittedly an escape to nowhere . Even so , more reassuring than otherwise : a visible link to space and wider horizons , an earnest of more technology due to come . The settlers will now need to acquire a different mind-set , vigorous yet also patient . <p> Jeff could not understand why Sandy was not joining him . There 's one of the settlers already feeling isolated , betrayed as if in tit-for-tat . Although in the end Jeff seemed resigned . Sandy herself cried and needed comforting . <p> On board are Mary , Sandy and James , and Eric of hydroponics , Com Sherwin and his Second , Max Muller , Engineer Sam Nakata , Navigator Nellie van Tom , Comp and ship-systems manager Bill Brooks , and shuttle pilot Dan Addison . Ten souls , or nine plus something else . <p> COM SHERWIN is in several minds . <p> The Voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such a way , then each traveler will find himself or herself accompanied by a copy of the Voice . <p> How can James be in nine places at once  --  until , at journey 's end , he becomes a single person again ? He is not any ordinary baby . He is a child of reality and probability . <p> The journey time can be shortened considerably  --  not by time  --  jumping such as benefited Mary , but by " compression , " which James can not explain in comprehensible words . The result should be a journey time of one month rather than six . <p> It may be that James 's entangled presence will permit a limited amount of communication between the otherwise isolated stellanauts , via him , although such messages may be unreliable , even if comforting . Or otherwise . <p> Of course , him being an infant , albeit an infant prodigy , his copies will need caring for . How well up on the care of infants are Com Sherwin , Max Muller , Dan Addison ... ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise there would not be enough paths to sum over . <p> The voice likens those phantom journeys to you standing between two mirrors and beholding repeated reflections of yourself diminishing and disappearing into the distance . The first five or six reflections certainly seem like authentic representations ; thereafter you become increasingly vague and distant . Thus it will feel to the phantoms . Seven or so will feel like you , and will disperse when you - or one of the others  --  exits from Q-space . Others will not possess enough substance to experience more than a dream-like state , the unraveling of which will hardly be too traumatic . <p> So there 's about a one-in-eight chance that you personally will reintegrate . Seven echoes will hope for this but fail to achieve it . Much better odds than one in a hundred  --  though even so ! <p> Mary has slightly better odds . If she tosses a dice to decide whether to euthanize herself and James while in Q-space so as to enfold herself into psychospace  --  by far the best way to choose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does indeed toss the number for death , then one of her will definitely die but will not have lived in vain , and one of the remainder will survive . <p> A link may even endure between her dead self and her living self , so the Voice surmises . <p> " So , " says Com Sherwin to those who are all gathered in the restaurant , " do we go for it ? " <p> Is he recollecting the dive of The Dart into Jupiter and the harpooning of the gas-whale ? Do I go for it or do I not ? <p> " I 'd like an advisory show of hands . Purely advisory for the moment . " <p> The dissenters are Sam Nakata , Nellie van Tom , and Bill Brooks  --  engineering , navigation , and computer systems respectively . Com Sherwin may or may not have prevailed previously upon his Second , Max Muller . As a pilot Dan Addison has coped with risks before , and he 's rather too extravert to endure another spell of six months all on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , although are their votes quite equal in weight to engineering or navigation ? <p> " Well , " says Sherwin , " that 's five to three in favor , ignoring myself and the Voice . " <p> " Commander , " says Sam Nakata , " we have absolutely no reason to opt for this , this experiment  --  on the say-so of a baby ! It 's our duty to take Pioneer back through Q-space by a route that demonstrably succeeds . If that involves six months alone , we already hacked it once . At least this time we 're forewarned . " <p> " Obviously he 's no ordinary baby . But more to the point , if we cut the journey time by five months each way , that 's almost one year sooner we can bring more people and equipment to Tee-Cee . Imagine returning and finding the colony falling apart because we did n't take the fast route . I think that bears thinking seriously about . " <p> " Yes . It does . If . " <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Sandy , " so long as one of each does . We wo n't know anything about the ones who do n't arrive . " <p> " Plenty of fish in the probability sea , eh ? " remarks Nellie van Torn . " I do n't like to think of five of me evaporating , especially if the one who evaporates is me . " <p> " It 's an identity problem , " says Bill Brooks surprisingly . " If you could copy your mind into an android , say while you 're unconscious , and if the act of mind-scanning erases your brain , is the android simply continuing your own life ? The android will certainly feel as though it 's doing so , indistinguishably . If you were dying of terminal cancer you would opt for this continuation , would n't you ? " <p> " Are you changing your informal vote ? " asks Com Sherwin . <p> " I do n't like to think that I may be putting ninety-odd other people in jeopardy just because of qualms about myself , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . " <p> There is much to mull over . Mary begins giving classes on the medical aspects of infant care , and Sandy on the practical details . James begins hypnotizing Mary . <p> The time has come . Nellie and Sam have agreed under protest . Computer has accepted complex instructions from James who has crawled and is now taking his first precocious steps . He 's also toilet-trained and able to eat mashed pap . In view of his huge linguistic skills he ought n't to be much bother to look after . On the contrary , a valuable companion . <p> Mary lies in her cabin . <p> " Sixty seconds to Q-insertion .... " <p> " Thirty seconds .... " <p> " Fifteen .... " <p> The seconds pass , the cabin ripples , silence from the speakers . She is alone with the Voice . <p> " Can you contact Sandy , Voice ? " <p> The Voice 's eyes grow glazed . <p> " Hi Mary , Sandy and James here , James and Sandy here , We 're here . I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  " <p> Six or seven Sandys are talking through James 's lips one after another , all saying much the same thing , wherever here may be . Certainly is n't this cabin . A babble of ghosts . These may be difficult conversations to keep up . <p> " Can you contact me myself , Voice ? I mean , another me ? " <p> James concentrates . <p> Presently : " When are we going to do it ? " Commit suicide , and Jamesicide  --  she knows what she means . <p> " Should we all do it at the same time ? " <p> " Is that really me ? " <p> " We never got a chance like this to discuss things . " <p> " We talked to ourself in Q-space before , but this is very different ! " <p> " Hey , what about our Hippocratic Oath ? " <p> Babel , from James 's lips . The nine voices of Mary . Beats schizophrenia any day . This procedure offers very little counsel or comfort , and is perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel isolated in the ship . She can summon up voices  --  but it is better not to hear them . Better to be alone with James , the better to concentrate her mind , in case it might fly apart . Doubtless her other selves have decided likewise , since they do not call her . Several Com Sherwins do call , wanting status reports . What is the point of them asking for those ? Perfectionism ? Several Erics also call , wishing her well , better , best . James is with everyone . <p> Q + 4 . Do it today . Today is a perfectly fine day to end one 's life . One 's life ? What if all of the Maries roll a four , unlucky number in the minds of the Japanese because shi which means four also means death , thank you for that knowledge , Hiroaki . What if all or none roll a four ? Is Maries the plural of Mary ? <p> She has brought overdoses of morphine from the dispensary , morphine to send one to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready , Voice ? Any last wishes ? Some mashed carrots ? " <p> Mary is an Angel in a woodland by a tiny lake . And she is also Mary who sees the Angel and now understands what she sees . Her vision spans forward  --  inside a starship a dark-haired athletic woman is grinning at her . <p> " To be really aboard at last ? Great ! Ah , do you mean the motion ... ? It 's okay . " The woman swings her head friskily . " Oops . " <p> Switching her attention , Mary sinks to her knees amongst the bushes aglitter with spiders ' webs . <p> " Overmind , Overmind ! " The words seem like the start of a prayer , a prayer that can perhaps be answered . <p> Com Sherwin 's voice comes briskly . " Hear me . Re-emergence from Q-space achieved . We 're in the home system  --  we 're home . Crew present on bridge : Muller , Nakata , van Tom , and Brook , and me . Call in please in order : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Present , Commander . " <p> Oh yes , what a present . She is alive . Alive . <p> " Tate ? " <p> Sandy 's voice comes over the speaker . " Present . So is James . " <p> James the Voice . James the Link . James the Knowledge . <p> Eric and Dan Addison also report in . <p> Glimpses of eons of human experience crash in upon kneeling Mary , rocking her . Billions of souls batter at her like a plague of butterflies . Birdsong sounds like the high-speed warble of data-flow from which an audible message may somehow emerge , if only it can step down to her level . <p> And she feels such a twinge within , somewhere in her belly , as the glimpses flee , and the butterflies vanish , and the bird-song hushes . <p> She knows that inside her is the beginning of a Voice . <p> Author Affiliation
