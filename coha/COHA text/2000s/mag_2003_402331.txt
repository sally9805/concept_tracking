When your brain 's emotional equipment needs a tune-up , you get clues : you do not sleep well , you worry too much , you start feeling overwhelmed , you lose your enthusiasm or your ability to concentrate . // If you are often feeling depressed , anxious or stressed , you are not alone . We are in a bad-mood epidemic , a hundred times more likely to have significant mood problems than people born a hundred years ago . And these problems are on the rise . Adult rates of depression and anxiety have tripled since 1990 and over 80 percent of those who consult medical doctors today complain of excessive stress . Even our children are in trouble , with at least one in 10 suffering from significant mood disorders . Our mood problems are increasing so fast that by 2020 they will outrank AIDS , accidents and violence as the primary causes of early death and disability . It is clear that our moods are deteriorating at unprecedented rates . What is not clear is why . What is this tidal wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more unhappy than they were one hundred years ago or even 10 years ago ? It is true that we are facing some unprecedented adversity in the 21st century . But even if it is the high pressure or the absence of family support or the terrorist threat , for example , why are we now so unresponsive to traditionally reliable remedies like long vacations , psychotherapy and spiritual counsel ? Why are we forced to turn more and more to medication for solace ? I propose that much of our increasing emotional distress stems from easily correctable malfunctions in our brain and body chemistry-malfunctions that are primarily the result of critical , unmet nutritional needs . More important , I propose that a complete yet easy-to-implement nutritional repair plan can actually start to eliminate in 24 hours what I call our " false moods . " Some negative feelings are unavoidable and even beneficial . They are what I call " true emotions . " These true , genuine responses to the real difficulties we encounter in life can be hard to take . They can even be unbearable at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they also can be vitally important . True grief moves us through our losses , true fear warns us of danger , true anger can defend us from abuse and true shame can teach us to grow and change . These true emotions typically pass or diminish naturally and even when they are repressed or misdirected , they can usually be relieved through counseling . But when we suffer for no justifiable reason ; when the pain of a broken heart does not mend like a broken bone ; when rest , psychotherapy , prayer and meditation can make little impact-then we must suspect the emotional impostor , the meaningless biochemical error-the " false mood . " You should not have to live with these kinds of distorted moods on a regular basis . It is like having an engine that sputters , preventing you from having a smooth emotional ride . When your brain 's emotional equipment needs a tune-up , you get clues : you do not sleep well , you worry too much , you start feeling overwhelmed , you lose your enthusiasm or your ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wine or marijuana to get some relief . If you experience these kinds of symptoms frequently , you may have just come to accept them , assuming them simply to be unfortunate features of your basic personality . But chances are you are wrong . Now you have an opportunity to discover your true emotional nature . Your brain is responsible for most of your feelings , both true and false . In concert with some surprisingly brain-like areas of your heart and gut , it transmits your feelings through four highly specialized and potent kinds of mood molecules . If it has plenty of all four , it keeps you as happy as you can possibly be , given your particular life circumstances . But if your brain runs low on these mood transmitters-whether because of a minor genetic miscue , because it has used them up coping with too much stress or because you arc not eating the specific foods it needs-it stops producing normal emotions on a consistent basis . Instead , it starts hitting false emotional notes , like a piano out of tune . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the false moods and their causes have been identified by one of the fastest-growing fields of science-neuroscience , the field that studies the workings and effects of the brain . Drug companies have been using this information to create products that can give our emotional equipment a quick charge . But that is not the same thing as a real repair job . Fortunately , the emotional tune-up that we need so badly now is readily available . In fact , the repair tools we need for this crucial effort are shockingly simple . They are specific foods and nutrient supplements , particularly amino acid supplements , that are so exactly what the brain needs that they can begin to correct emotional malfunctions in just 24 hours . This is the secret : There are 22 different kinds of amino acids in high-protein foods like chicken , fish , beef , eggs and cheese . You may have heard them referred to as the building blocks of protein . Each amino has its own name and unique duties to perform but only a few very special aminos can serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six of these amino acids , taken as supplements , can effectively reverse all four of the brain deficiencies that cause false moods . Each of the four mood engines in your brain needs a different amino acid fuel . The lower your access to amino fuel , the more false mood symptoms you can develop . The question is how much " gas " do you have in each of your engines ? How do you know when you have run too low ? How can you fill them up ? Which amino brain fuels do you need ? Where can you get them ? How long will it take ? You will soon learn what the best brain foods are for you and how to find and use the amino acid supplements that will jump-start all of your emotional engines and keep them fired up . The four emotion generators in your brain are called " neurotransmitters . " Some of their specific names will probably be familiar to you : serotonin , catecholamines , GABA and endorphin . Each of these four neurotransmitters has a distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of its particular amino acid fuel available . A well stocked brain produces true emotions . Depending on your life circumstances , you will generally feel emotionally positive , if your key neurotransmitter levels are high . A poorly stocked brain produces false moods , if you drop too low in any of the key neurotransmitters , you will tend to develop a specific set of defective moods as a result . If you are high in serotonin , you are positive , confident , flexible and easygoing . If you are sinking in serotonin , you will tend to become negative , obsessive , worried , irritable and sleepless . Let us take a close look at the mechanics of this mood type . The brains serotonin quadrant needs to be brimming with molecules at all times . When it is , your brain can cheerfully fire away with this ready fuel supply , transmitting positive feelings and thoughts . If not , these happy reactions are blocked . But that does not simply leave you feeling emotionally blank . Unfortunately , a decrease in serotonin can produce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would normally allow you to experience : instead of seeing your glass as half full , you see it as half empty . Instead of feeling proud of your accomplishments , all you can think of is what you have not accomplished . Instead of a sound sleep , you get insomnia . Instead of enjoying your family members , you are irritated by them . Instead of peace , you have anxiety . Instead of looking forward to life , you may regard it with dread and even have thoughts of suicide . Symptoms of serotonin deficiency include : experiencing dark , pessimistic thoughts ; often feeling worried , anxious , self-critical or guilty ; abusive behavior ; being a perfectionist , neatnic or control freak , a computer , TV or work addict ; a dislike for dark weather or clear-cut , fall-winter depression ( SAD ) ; anxiety or panic attacks ( your heart races , it is hard to breathe ) ; PMS or menopausal moodiness ( tears , anger , depression ) ; are you a night owl or do you find it hard to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fibromyalgia ( unexplained muscle pain ) or TMJ ( pain , tension and grinding associated with your jaw ) ? Have you had suicidal thoughts or plans ? Do you find relief from any of the above symptoms through exercise ? Precious serotonin is synthesized in your body from tryptophan , an amino acid ( protein building block ) found in foods like turkey , beef and cheese . Tryptophan first converts into a substance called 5-HTP ( 5-hydroxytryptophan ) , which then coverts directly into serotonin . This crucial three-step process can be a short-step process and can be short-circuited by a number of things . For example , if there is not enough tryptophan in your diet-a problem for many of us-your body can not manufacture enough 5-HTP or serotonin to keep you happy . Or your natural production of serotonin may be inhibited by chemicals in your food such as caffeine , alcohol or the artificial sweetener aspartame . Your serotonin production can even be disrupted if you are pregnant or not getting enough sunlight or exercise . Bouts of extreme stress can also dry up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may have inherited a genetic tendency to under produce serotonin , one that can be aggravated by all of the above . No matter what the cause of your drop in serotonin , it does not mean that you are doomed to languish in this particular mood pit for the rest of your life . Even the saggiest serotonin levels can be quickly elevated , allowing you to experience the full range of emotion that nature intended for you . The 24-Hour 5-HTP Transformation The inexpensive nutrient supplement 5-HTP , made from an African bean , is the almost instant solution to most low-serotonin problems . It can be found in every health food store and many pharmacies in America . Your body can make its own 5-HTP to convert into serotonin but here is one catch : It must have enough tryptophan on hand from food to make it out of and chances are it does not . If you take a 5-HTP supplement though , your serotonin production will no longer be dependent on the tryptophan you may or may not get in food . That means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores and begin to feel the return of your true emotional self in minutes . Although 5-HTP has been studied and used extensively in Japan and Europe since before 1980 , our clinic began using it only when it became available in the United States in 1997 . Since then we have seen hundreds of almost instant transformations in mood as a direct result of its use . As an antidepressant , 5-HTP is so effective that is has repeatedly matched or outperformed many of the most established antidepressant drugs , including Prozac , without the negative side effects so often associated with these drugs . In a 1980 study of 99 patients who had been deeply depressed for an average of nine years , almost half achieved complete recovery while others experienced significant improvement after being given 5-HTP supplements . The study 's author , Dr. J. J. Van Heile , had this to say about the benefits of 5-HTP : " I have never in 20 years used an agent which ( 1 ) was effective so quickly ; ( 2 ) restored the patients so completely to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) was so entirely without side effects . " Numerous other studies also attest to 5-HTP 's remarkable safety and effectiveness , even when compared to prescription antidepressants . My staff and I have been amazed at how quickly 5-HTP can lift the spirits of clients who had been depressed for so long that they had forgotten what it was like to be cheerful and optimistic . Within a day or two after starting their 5-HTP , they typically report that their feelings of anxiety and negativity have evaporated , that their sleep has improved and that their self-esteem has been restored . Amazingly , we have seen these 5-HTP transformations take place before our very eyes in as little as 10 minutes . We have watched as surly teens turned into , friendly humans , cranky adults turned into comedians and shy , self-conscious people turned into real charmers . At first when you take 5-HTP you will feel the difference , typically within 15 minutes , but your mood will be noticeably elevated for only a few hours . That is why most people need to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late afternoon and nine or 10 P.M. are usually the best times to take them but take them earlier if your symptoms trouble you in the morning . I recommend 50 mg as the initial dosage of 5-HTP . If you need more , increase the dosage to 100 mg then 150 mg-not to exceed 150 mg per dose . As you nourish your brain 's serotonin zone with these amino fuels , your serotonin levels will rise , eventually to capacity . After that you will be able to count on improved moods all the time , yet you wo n't need any more supplements to keep them that way . At some point in the next few weeks or months , your brain will give you a signal to let you know that you have done it-you have filled up on serotonin . How will you know ? Maybe you will get too relaxed , even sleepy during the day ; maybe you will have a mild headache after a dose . Most people , though , just forget to take their 5-HTP or other supplements after a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Note : Information from this article is from The Mood Cure by Julia Ross , M.A. <p>
