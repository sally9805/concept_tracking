George R.R. Martin is fond of sudden reversals . The tasty but poisoned dish , the false god who abruptly proves all too real , the unsalvageable rogue who strikes a hidden vein of decency when we  --  and he  --  least expect it . Martin is also partial to sacked castles , bear pits , disastrous battles , cynical betrayals , public executions , assassinations , ill luck , duels to the death , ambushes in forests and corpses left rotting in green hedgerows . The world Martin writes about may bear a passing resemblance to Olde Englande , but it is not a Merrie one . <P> Martin is n't the best known of America 's straight-up fantasy writers . That honor would probably go to upstart Christopher Paolini ( Eragon ) , or Robert Jordan ( the endlessly turning Wheel of Time series ) , or better yet to ageless grandmistress Ursula K. LeGuin ( A Wizard of Earthsea ) . But of those who work in the grand epic-fantasy tradition , Martin is by far the best . In fact , with his newest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages ) , currently descending on bookstores and ascending best-seller lists , this is as good a time as any to proclaim him the American Tolkien . <P> A Feast for Crows is the fourth volume of a series with the deceptively Renaissance fair-y name A Song of Ice and Fire . It 's set mostly in the Seven Kingdoms , an unstable amalgamation of nations caught in the act of vigorously ripping itself to shreds following the death of King Robert Baratheon . Martin shoots the action from many angles , with a dozen narrators , the better to reflect its gritty , twisty , many-sided nature and its vast cast of would-be queens and kings , rogues , bastards , bandits , madmen , mercenaries , exiles , priests and various uncategorizable wild cards . Martin may write fantasy , but his politik is all real . <P> In the wrong hands , a big ensemble like this can be deadly , but Martin is a tense , surging , insomnia-inflicting plotter and a deft and inexhaustible sketcher of personalities  --  including Tyrion Lannister , a bitter , cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brienne the Beauty , a huge , unmarriageable , monstrously ugly woman who fights in full armor and usually wins . Martin has an astonishing ability to focus on epic sweep and tiny , touching human drama simultaneously . The supernatural plays a role , but only rarely . <P> What really distinguishes Martin , and what marks him as a major force for evolution in fantasy , is his refusal to embrace a vision of the world as a Manichaean struggle between Good and Evil . Tolkien 's work has enormous imaginative force , but you have to go elsewhere for moral complexity . Martin 's wars are multifaceted and ambiguous , as are the men and women who wage them and the gods who watch them and chortle , and somehow that makes them mean more . A Feast for Crows is n't pretty elves against gnarly orcs . It 's men and women slugging it out in the muck , for money and power and lust and love .                   @ @
