20 unexpected ways to unleash the true potential of the technology products you already own . // YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE doing it . Your coworkers are doing it . There 's no shame in doing it-even in broad daylight . I 'm talking about hacking : your digital camera , your M ? 3 player , your TiVo , your network , and of course your PC . If it has a plug , a jack , a battery , a cord , a chip , a disk drive , or a display , chances are it can be reprogrammed and tweaked in some way to give you more speed , advanced features , or greater storage-without your paying for a whole new unit . Hacks can run the gamut from simple software downloads , to involved hardware swapping and modification that sometimes requires specialty parts . I 'll point you in the right direction and walk you through the steps to get the goods , do the deed , and enjoy the secrets hidden within your gadgets . But first , a few important notes about safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacks will probably void the warranty of your system or of specific components , so until you get comfortable it 's best to start hacking on hardware you are n't too attached to . Also note that while some vendors are much more tolerant of hacks and tweaks than others-Intel and NVidia even provide you with some tools-many manufacturers take a harder line and try to make it as difficult for you as possible . In any case , you 'll want to take some precautions before you begin : * First , back up any data you have stored on the device , or start with a fresh system-hacking can render your PC useless in a nanosecond but cost you hours of restoration time . * Download and safely store the original firmware or drivers for a device , in case something goes wrong and you need to get your gadget back in working condition . * When tuning up your PC , measure and test your system before you start and as you hack so that you can tell whether you 're doing more harm than good . Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 76 to find out what to test and how . * Disconnect the power before working inside the case of any device . Be careful not to drop or leave tools , screws , clips , loose wires , or extra brackets floating around inside the case ; anything conductive could short out a critical circuit . PC HARDWARE Free Speed : Overclockinq Your PC Performance Boosting Basics * WANT A FREE SPEED BOOST for your computer ? Try a little overclocking-an enthusiast trick that PC tweakers have been using for years to get free speed out of their systems . Many of today 's CPUs can run faster than they 're rated to do , and getting that added performance is simply a matter of carefully changing some settings . Overclocking wo n't turn an ancient PC into a powerhouse , but it can help you squeeze every drop of performance out of your machine . Two variables set the speed at which your CPU runs : the system bus speed , and the CPU 's clock multiplier . To determine the CPU 's actual operating speed , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus speed of 100 MHz and a multiplier value of 5.5 translate to a CPU running speed of 550 MHz . This simple formula works with most Intel Celeron , Pentium II , Pentium III , and Pentium 4 chips , as well as with AMD chips . Some motherboard and CPU combinations let you change one or both of those variables , setting a new speed for the CPU . Boost either setting and you 're officially overclocking . In my experience , most CPUs and motherboards will run fine when overclocked 10 to 20 percent faster than the rated CPU speed . The bus speed setting may also affect the speed of the PCI or AGP bus , depending on which chip set the motherboard uses and how that chip set connects to all of the subsystems on the board . The trick to overclocking is in knowing when to stop . Crank up the speed completely beyond the operating limits of the CPU , system bus , or RAM , and the PC will crash or freeze a lot . If you 've set the clock too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may fail to boot , and you 'll have to use the PC Setup program to reset the clock settings stored in CMOS RAM . ( In some cases , you may have to reset the CMOS RAM more directly : Either remove the CMOS memory retention battery , typically a button-style cell , or move a jumper on the system board ; that jumper is often marked " clear CMOS ' ' . ) If your PC uses switches or jumpers to set dock and multiplier values , you 'll simply need to reset them to a slower speed . Utilities like NVidia 's NTune ( find.pcworld.com/46554 ) , among others I 'll discuss below , make it easy to play around with settings , test them , and store certain configs for special occasions-say , when you want a power boost to win in Half-Life 2. // FIGURE 1 : Example of overclockinq settings In a PC Setup program . // Some systems ( mostly the name brands , such as Dell , Gateway , HP , IBM , and Sony ) and many Pentium I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the manufacturers hard-code clocking values into the components to minimize support calls . CPU Overclockinq the Easy Way * MOST AFTER-MARKET MOTHERBOARDS built Within the past three to four years , such as those from Abit , Asus , MSI , or Tyan , have CPU dock settings available in the PC Setup program stored in the BIOS chip . As your PC boots , an on-screen message should indicate which key you hold down to enter the PC Setup program . Your motherboard manual should explain how to find the parameters that control CPU speed . The PC Setup program screen in FIGURE 1 is from an Abit KA7 motherboard that offers lots of overclocking controls when the CPU Operating Speed is set to " User Define ' ' . The CPU FSB/PCI Clock setting also affects the speed of the PCI bus . I have found that most PCI cards will overclock about as well as the average CPU does . // FIGURE 3 ( above ) ; FIGURE 4 ( left ) . // Overclocking the AMD Athlon XP+ 2600 processor on my ECS KT-600A motherboard involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2600 processor is fixed at 11.5 , allowing a CPU speed range between 1910 MHz ( 166 x 11.5 ) and 2288 MHz ( 199 x 11.5 ) . The Athlon XP+ 2600 runs at 1900 MHz typically , but the chip I tested worked well when overclocked to 2200 MHz . CPU Overclocking by the Bits BEFORE DESIGNERS MADE CPU speed settings changeable via software , switches or jumpers on the motherboard controlled the speed . You 'll find this arrangement typical of early ( 3 to 4 years old or older ) AMD , Pentium I and II , and Celeron boards . Overclocking with switches and jumpers works in the same way as using settings in PC Setup : You simply increment the multiplier and bus speed settings to speed up the processor until you find a reliable running speed . The pictures in FIGURE 3 and FIGURE 4 , above , show the jumper posts for the CPU 's frontside bus speed , with options ranging from 100 MHz to 110 MHz . You can see the reference chart for the bus speed jumper settings silk-screened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being on the board-chances are you 'll need a manual handy to properly set the jumpers and DIP switches ) . The CPU clock speed setting also affects the AGP bus speed on this board . Other motherboards use DIP switches ( Figure 4 ) for both the CPU clock speed and the multiplier settings . Video Overclocking Made Easy MOST OF THE OVERCLOCKING buzz is not about turning a PC into a supercomputer . Instead , it 's about gamers being able to see , navigate , run , and shoot faster and smoother . Not surprisingly , you can overclock the processors on your graphics card in much the same way you would your main CPU . Video gaming has come a long way since Pong first appeared on TV-style monitors in the early 1980s . Even if you do n't play video games , boosting the performance of your graphics system can enhance the enjoyment of videos and business presentations . // FIGURE 5 : Overclockinq an NVidia GPU . // Your graphics speed boost comes from within , without your having to pop the case . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the brand of card you have . NVidia has even built overclocking settings into its latest drivers . To enable them , open the Windows Registry editor by going to Start , Run , typing reqedit , and pressing Enter . Navigate to " **59;7063;TOOLONG , " right-click the right pane of the editor and choose to add a new DWord called coolbits . Edit that entry and give it a hex value of 3 , then close your Registry editor . The NVidia tab ( FIGURE 5 ) under your PC 's advanced display properties settings will now feature a " Clock Frequency Settings " page that allows you to adjust memory and graphics chip clock speeds for your board . Click the " Detect Optimal Frequencies " button if you want the utility to try to find safe overclocked settings for your graphics board . ATI automatically provides a tab called " Overdrive " under Display **28;7124;TOOLONG for its Radeon-based cards . That tab handles basic overclocking , but for more granular control , you will need to download a utility . I prefer the free ATITool from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the card . OPERATING SYSTEM Make Windows More Efficient Advanced Windows Tweaks WHEN I 'M READY FOR some serious Windows hacking , I break out my copy of XQDC 's $8 X-Setup Pro from www.x-setup.net . X-Setup offers access to hundreds of novel , esoteric , and critical parameters that configure how Windows and many applications work . What 's more , X-Setup Pro provides a lot of help so you can understand what the parameters are and whether they may have a negative impact on your system . // FIGURE 6 : Setting the swap file size . // But before you dive into arcane Windows settings , there are some easier tweaks you can make . " Windows Rejuvenated " on page 60 is full of detailed tips on how to reinvigorate and restore zip to Windows . If you 'd like to go deeper , there are a few other settings you can modify to smooth your Windows experience . Your system will run more efficiently with a simple change to two important Windows file settings : the location Windows uses to store temporary files and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file ( FIGURE 6 ) . Two Key Settings BEFORE YOU modify anything , clean some clutter off your hard drive : 1 . Open My Computer , right-click your C : drive , and then select Properties . 2 . Click the Disk Cleanup button , wait until the tool is done calculating , and then click OJC and Yes to remove the litter . 3 . Click OKto close the Properties dialog box . Now it 's time to start tweaking . To tame temporary files and set the swap file size in Windows 2000 and XP , do the following : 1 . Right-click My Computer and select Properties . 2 . Select the Advanced tab and then the Environment Variables button . // FIGURE 7 : Temporary storage setting . // 3 . In the Environment Variables dialog box , select TEMP and then TMP ( FIGURE 7 ) , and edit the values for those variables to point at an easily recognized drive and folder location so you 'll always know where they are . That will make it easy to clean out those files periodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK 4 . On the Advanced tab under Performance , click Settings . 5 . In the Performance Options box , select the Advanced tab . 6 . Under " Virtual memory ' ' , click the Change button . 7 . Select Custom size , enter the same value for the initial and maximum sizes , and click the Set button ( Figure 6 ) . I like to set the swap file at a fixed size of at least 1.5 times the amount of RAM the machine has , unless the computer I 'm working on has a lot of RAM . For systems with 256MB of RAM , I use a 384MB swap file . With a roomier 512MB of RAM , I back off to a 512MB swap file , and at a comfortable IGB of RAM , I stick with 768MB. 8 . Close the dialog boxes by clicking OK , then restart Windows . NETWORKING Optimize Your Net Connection Broadband Boost BOOST YOUR network 's reliability and speed by tuning two important network settings in Windows : RWIN , short for Receive Window , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Tweak critical network settings with the free DrTCP app. // You can use Regedit to set these values in the Windows Registry following the instructions from Annoyances.org ( find.pcworld.com/46436 ) , or you can download and run the free DrTCP ( FIGURE 8 ) from www.dslreports.com/drtcp . The RWIN setting alters the TCP/IP received-data buffering on your PC-the more you have , the faster your downloads , within limits . Most users have found that an RWIN value of between 32768 and 65536 yields the speediest downloads ( if you do n't set this , RWIN defaults to four times the MTU value ) . MTU sets the maximum size of data packets sent and received , and it must match the type of connection you have-dial-up , PPPoE ( most DSL and cable ) , or LAN . The standard maximum value for TCP/IP is 1500 , but for dial-up connections it should be 576 to ensure minimal packet fragmentation . For PPPoE , an MTU of no more than 1492 is recommended . Some ISPs and virtual private network connections require a setting as low as 1300 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system and for data encryption overhead . For a little extra oomph , also tweak the number of simultaneous connections your PC can make to one server . If you have a fast cable or DSL connection , boosting this setting from its default value of two to four or six can help pages load faster . Some Web servers limit you to two simultaneous connections , so you wo n't see a speed increase on all sites you visit . You will have to restart Windows for the changes to take effect . Determine the settings recommended for your PC and test them using the Tweak Test at **25;7154;TOOLONG . It may take some time to find the best settings for your Internet connection . QUIET PCs Keep Your System Cool and Quiet Chill Your CPU , Dude ASPEED BREEDS HEAT . After you 've tuned up your CPU , it 's especially critical that you get as much heat away from the chip as possible , or you 'll end up with a smelly blackened chunk of fried silicon . Most systems come with factory-approved heat sinks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but such standard equipment may be inadequate for overdocking , and it 's usually pretty loud . A new heat sink and fan can improve your CPU cooling while keeping your system quiet . Zalman 's $50 CNPS7000B CPU cooler ( FIGURE 9 ) works with many Athlon and   CPUs . And Thermaltake 's $40 CL-P0092 heat-pipe cooling system for   chips looks as cool as it works . // FIGURE 9. // Heat sinks and fans are fine for most people ; but at many overclocking and PC modder sites , water-cooling kits ( ranging in price from about $100 to $180 ) are all the rage . Liquid cooling worked for Cray 's supercomputers , but in that case the entire machine was immersed in inert nonconductive liquid-not exactly a practical setup for home users . Most liquid-cooling systems for PCs circulate water across a heat pad atop the CPU and then pump and dump the heat outside . This method offers incredible cooling advantages for extremely overclocked CPUs , chip sets , and graphics cards . Make sure you have enough room in your case and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quieter ALL OF YOUR enhanced CPU overclocking and PC tweaking can kill your power supply , as the souped-up parts try to suck more juice out of this obscure , little , wire-crammed box in the corner of your PC case . You need a power supply upgrade , and you need it now . What better way to complement your tricked-out PC than a cool and quiet new power supply with enough juice to keep every chip , drive , and light-emitting source humming along ? // FIGURE 10. // Power does n't always have to be as noisy as the exhaust rattle from a modified Honda Civic . A handful of vendors now offer fanless supplies , such as the $170 Antec Phantom 350-watt model ( FIGURE 10 ) . These units sport beefed-up internal heat sinks that provide enough cooling for the power supply without requiring you to use a noisy fan . Pad Your PC for Quieter Operation NOW THAT YOU 'VE shushed your power supply , it 's time to do the same to your PC . You can quit shouting over fan noise and speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few key components . Temperature-sensing , speed-adjusting fans built into some current PC models make a nice first touchtry the $6 Thermaltake A1214 if your machine needs replacements . But vibrations from fan and especially disk-drive rotation may still be enough to make you run screaming from the room . Those large , flat-panel areas on the sides of your case can act as sounding boards for any noise inside your system . Put your ears at ease by installing vibration-dampening pads ( FIGURE 11 ) from DampTek ( find.pcworld.com/46440 ; $50 for a pack of three ) on the inside of those panels .

AUDIO PLAYERS Store More MUSIC Pack More Drive Into Your Creative Nomad Zen Player * WHETHER THE ORIGINAL 20GB hard drive in your Zen has crashed or you simply want to be able to pack more M files into it with a bigger drive , replacing the Zen 's hard drive requires little more than a small screwdriver and about 30 minutes . The Zen does all the hard work in its firmware , formatting the new drive so that it can store more M files . Many Nomad-related forums mention this hack-and unlike with many hacks from techie forums , the conclusion in the real world is that this hack really is that simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void your Zen 's warranty . The first step is to find an appropriate replacement or upgrade hard drive . Since Creative , the makers of the Nomad Zen , use commonly available 2.5-inch Fujitsu laptop hard drives , you should have no trouble finding a 20- , 40- or 6OGB replacement at a well-stocked local computer shop or online retailer . Make sure you have the Nomad Zen software installed on your PC before you begin , and transfer all your music to the PC first so you can load it back on the device when you 're done . With a new drive on hand , it 's time to start the drive-ectomy on your Zen player . You will need a #0 or #00 cross-head screwdriver , steady hands , and a place to keep the parts from getting lost on the floor-a baking sheet works wonders . Set the player face down on a soft cloth to prevent marring the face . Then access and remove the current drive as follows : 1 . Remove four screws that hold the Zen 's back cover in place - two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player . 2 . Separate the cover from the body of the player . You will see the hard drive held in place with a metal retaining strap . 3 . Remove the strap by prying the edges gently away from where they catch the player body at the top and bottom of the drive . Set the strap aside . It will be put back over the new drive . 4 . Carefully lift the top end of the drive ( at the opposite end from the connector ) away from the player body and up to gain access to the flexible circuit and connector . 5 . Gently pull the drive out by holding the flexible circuit and connector steady and rocking the drive slightly side to side . 6 . At this point you will see the thin sheet of foam padding ( FIGURE 12 ) that provides the drive a modest amount of mechanical shock protection . Keep the padding in place . That was n't so bad now was it ? You 're almost halfway through the project and no doubt excited and eager to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to install and format it : 1 . Once again holding the flexible circuit and drive connector steady , carefully plug the new drive into the connector . 2 . Lay the drive into the player body . 3 . Replace the metal retaining strap around the drive and securely snap it onto the player body ( FIGURE 13 ) . 4 . Replace the back cover and secure it using the four screws you removed in the step above . Photograph FIGURE 13. // So far , so good . The next steps to complete the hack and ready the player to take on music are much easier : 1 . Connect the AC adapter to your player so you 'll be sure to have enough juice to get the drive prepared , the player properly reconnected to your computer , and its firmware updated . Do not connect the USB or FireWire cable yet . 2 . Power on the Zen . It should display a " rescue mode " menu . If not , hold down the Play/Pause button and reset the player . 3 . Select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " process takes but a few seconds . It 's not really formatting the entire drive-just preparing it for the player 's firmware , which you 'll reload next . 4 . Now connect the Zen to your computer . If you 've previously installed the Nomad Zen software on your PC , Plug and Play should detect the presence and status of the player . The " ZenUniversalUpgrade " dialog should appear . If it does n't , disconnect the player , reinstall the software , and then reconnect. 5 . Select Yes to proceed with the firmware upload . After a few seconds you should be able to access the " JukeBox Information " to see the firmware version and the new storage capacity . 6 . Load up your new drive with tunes and get jamming ! // FIGURE 2 : Performance testing with Sandra .
