When it comes to spying , Donald Rumsfeld is an impatient man . The Defense Secretary hated having to wait for CIA spooks to make arrangements with Afghanistan 's warlords before his special-operations commandos could infiltrate the country ahead of the 2001 U.S. invasion . These days Rumsfeld is even less inclined to depend on the CIA . Instead , he is pushing his generals to field a larger and more aggressive clandestine force to spy on terrorists worldwide and attack them . <P> Inside the Beltway , Rumsfeld 's spying efforts  --  the Pentagon last week publicly acknowledged that the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) is sending out special clandestine teams  --  seem to critics like a power grab . But the Defense Department says its agents can deliver intelligence on military targets that 's finer-grained than what the CIA provides  --  for example , architectural details of a building that commandos must storm . <P> To carry out that kind of work , the DIA has organized what it calls " strategic support teams , " groups of 10 or fewer agents who can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field . Senior Pentagon officials say that one such agent , an interrogator who was dispatched to Baghdad , managed to glean information in interviews with Iraqis that led to the capture of Saddam Hussein in 2003 . <P> Other Pentagon units also field secret agents . Code Names , a new book written by defense analyst William Arkin , identifies more than 100 secret units , intelligence programs and communications networks that the Pentagon has set up to fight terrorists . Many have exotic designations like Aztec Silence and Island Sun . " When you put together all these code names , it shows there 's something going on out there and it 's complex , " says Arkin . <P> Many of the secret activities are run by the U.S. Special Operations Command in Tampa , Fla. , whose 50,000 commandos have the green light to launch missions against terrorists . The command also maintains a clandestine force of several hundred undercover spies , who specialize , for example , in planting electronic sensors or scouting terrorist targets for attack . Nicknamed the Army of Northern Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unit is so secretive that it frequently changes its name to throw off outsiders trying to track it . Known in the early 1980s as the Intelligence Support Activity , the outfit over the years has had code names like Capacity Gear and Gray Fox . Its operations include hunting for terrorists as well as for clandestine **27;17428;TOOLONG facilities in the Middle East . <P> The CIA , uncomfortable with the Pentagon 's encroaching on its work , wants its station chiefs overseas to be informed of what Rumsfeld 's spies are up to . Some lawmakers fear that the Pentagon 's secret activity will escape the strict congressional oversight imposed on the CIA 's covert operations . <P> The Defense Department , in fact , has had a checkered history with cloak-and-dagger work . The Pentagon set up intelligence units in the early 1980s that were kept secret from Congress . They became rogue outfits , using tax dollars for questionable operations , to pay for expensive hotel rooms , first-class airline tickets and , in one instance , a hot-air balloon and a Rolls-Royce .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
