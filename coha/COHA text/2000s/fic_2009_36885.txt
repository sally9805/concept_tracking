Good news  --  I have my fugitive cornered . Bad news  --  I do n't have any backup . <br> The chase had encompassed forty-three hours with no sleep , very little food , and too many cups of cold coffee to count . It had crossed one state and three county lines and twice as many jurisdictions , only to circle back to within three miles of where it all started . And it looked like it was going to end at an abandoned house near Lisbon , Maryland . <br> Now fugitive recovery agent Nick Shepherd just had to decide whether to wait until his team arrived , or go in after Richie Carver on his own . <br> The old house did n't look as if it had been occupied for years . The whole structure was leaning on its foundation , the roof had holes in it , all the glass in the windows had been broken out , and weeds tangled across the yard nearly waist-high , hiding anything from old tires to snakes and groundhog holes . <br> He 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front porch , he discounted it immediately . Half the boards were gone ; the rest did n't look like they were too far behind . One wrong step and he 'd be risking a broken leg or worse . His best bet was to enter one of the windows along the side of the house  --  the same way Richie had gone in  --  and to pray that Richie was n't standing there ready to shoot him as he climbed through . <br> When a fugitive jumps bail and disappears , fugitive recovery agents suit up and go hunting . They are experts at tracking and pursuing and have powers even local police do n't have . Relentless and more than a little fearless , they sometimes have to run a fugitive into the ground . But a cornered animal can be far more dangerous than one on the run . <br> Richie Carver was as nasty as they came . He and his brother , Jon , were known for drugs , prostitutes , illegal gambling , and who knew what else . If it was illegal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jon was the brains of the operation , preferring to stay close to the office and the money . Richie , on the other hand , was the brawn . His job was to make sure that no one crossed Jon . The problem was , Richie had gone beyond breaking legs and busting heads to straight-up murder . And after he jumped bail , he became Nick 's problem . Nick and the <br> rest of the Prodigal Fugitive Recovery Agents . <br> Nick glanced at his watch again . It had been nearly seven minutes since Richie had disappeared through that window . He knew better than most that the worst thing a bounty hunter could do was run into a situation like this without backup , but sometimes he had to break the rules . <br> He keyed the radio on his shoulder . " Conner . Come in . " <br> It took a couple of seconds , but he heard his second-in-command 's voice crackle through in his earpiece . " Here , Boss . What 's going down ? " <br> " Richie 's run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " Rafe and I are ten , maybe fifteen out , Boss . Hold them horses . " <br> " No can do , Conn . " <br> " Wait for us , Boss . We 're close . " <br> " He 's been in there almost ten minutes . Ca n't take a chance on him getting away . " <br> " Do n't do it , Boss . I 've got my foot to the floor . Hang on . " <br> Nick stared at the house . He figured the best and worst that could happen and then keyed the radio again . " Just make sure you 're here before it turns ugly . " <br> He had just pulled the slide on his Glock when his cell phone vibrated . Assuming it was one of the members of his team , he flipped it open . " Yeah ? " <br> " Daddy ? " <br> " Krys ? Honey , I 'm right in the middle of something . Can I call you back ? " <br> " Sure . I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out if maybe you want to go out for pizza tonight . Mom 's working late . " <br> " Sure , baby . I 'll give you a call in a couple hours . " <br> " Okay . Love you , bye . " <br> " Love you , bye . " He used his thigh to close the phone and then shoved it down inside his shirt pocket , protected inside his Kevlar vest . <br> He checked his Taser to make sure it was fully charged and put it back in his thigh holster , then eased up to a low crouch and began to make his way from the edge of the woods to the house . He nearly tripped twice but managed to avoid twisting his ankle on the pile of lumber hidden in the weeds and the gopher hole on the other side of it . <br> He thought he might have seen a black snake slithering off near an old wheelbarrow , but he did n't look too closely . He was n't exactly fond of snakes , so he resorted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it did n't see him . <br> Easing up along the side of the house , he glanced furtively into the window . Living room . White plaster walls yellowed to beige and cracked with age . Light fixtures pulled from the ceiling . Wires dangling . Wood floors . And dust thick enough to leave footprints heading toward the back of the house . <br> Tucking his gun down in the holster , he prayed that Richie was somewhere else in the house and would stay there long enough for Nick to get through the window and pull his gun back out . He was halfway through the window when he saw the other footprints . Two pair , small , sneakers or athletic shoes . Kids . Probably teenagers . Were they here now ? Or were they remnants from a previous night ? Nick moved a little faster , scrambling through the broken window , snagging his shirt . <br> Then he the heard a scream . Female . Young . And in terror . <br> Continues ...          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
