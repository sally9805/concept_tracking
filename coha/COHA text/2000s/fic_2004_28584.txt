Chapter One HE LOOKED GOOD ENOUGH to eat . Crystal Peterson drew in a breath of the early-spring air as desire bloomed in her . Sunlight dappled Ron Kincaid 's golden hair and played off the contours of his biceps and thighs . He advanced with the other players up the field in Atlanta , Georgia 's Piedmont Park , each ripple of muscle sending warmth twisting through her . The man might be a photographer during the week , but on the weekends he had all the right moves . A shout drew Crystal 's gaze from the object of her affections , calling her attention back to her own team-mates . Sam Schaffer , her longtime friend and confi-dante , launched the football in a neat spiral . It sailed toward her . She leaped , hands outstretched . This was her chance . If she played this right , she 'd have everyone 's attention - including Ron 's . Rough leather stung her palms and a feeling of excitement gripped her . As many times as she and Sam had been through this drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damn ball . She ran . Ron pounded down the turf after her . Keenly aware that all eyes were on her , especially Ron 's , she kicked forward with everything she had . The makeshift end zone , marked by two park benches , yawned ahead of her , the way amazingly clear . Her heart quickened . She could make this touchdown . She could win the game . Surely Ron would notice her then . Someone went down with a loud thump behind her to her left , but she could still feel Ron in hot pursuit . He was close , too close . He 's going to catch me . A thrill raced through her . His heat pressed in behind her as her heart tripped wildly . In one swift motion , he took her down , rolling to soften the fall , cradling her in his arms . The solid planes of his body pressed into her , his chest firm against her back , his breath hot in her ear and the hard ridge behind his fly nestled in the cleft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth brushed across her cheek , then whispered along her lips - " Go right ! " Sam yelled from somewhere in the distance behind Ron , yanking her from her reverie . She swerved to the right . As always , Sam was covering her back . She had been following his lead ever since that day in the first grade , when he had helped her outmaneuver a bully on the playground . Three years of their old high-school gang meeting in the park for these Saturday games had only ingrained the instinct . If anyone could take out Ron , it was Sam . The end zone loomed just out of reach . Her lungs burned and her legs ached . Shouts rose all around her . She could feel Ron hot on her tail . Close . She imagined him reaching out , his fingertips brushing the rolled waistband of her sweats . The temptation to let him catch her swept over her , but she shrugged it off . With a primal yell , she dived for the end field . She hit the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shouts and hoots of victory rose up around her . She fell to her back , gulping in huge drafts of air . She 'd made it . They 'd won the game . Ron moved into the patch of blue above her , breathing hard himself , his cheeks ruddy and his hair appealingly windblown . " You 're fast , Peterson . " Euphoria rose in her and exploded in a wide grin . He knew her name . Before she could manage a reply , he sauntered away , spreading his smile and his charm to the number of female admirers who 'd watched him from the sidelines . They surrounded him now , evidently oblivious to Crystal 's double victory . She rose up on her elbows and cocked her head , squinting against the sun to be sure he showered his attention equally on each of his companions , without focusing on any one of them . All appearances indicated he was still single and unattached . Though it rankled to see so many women pawing him , she could n't quite blame them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on her . A gorgeous brunette , one of the newcomers to the group , hovered near Sam . Not surprising , since she bore the long legs and sultry appearance that distinguished all of Sam 's women . Only she was n't technically one of Sam 's women . She had thrown out the bait , all right , but Sam was n't biting , which came as a surprise . He 'd never been one for serious relationships , though it seemed lately he was n't even going for the casual ones . Crystal shook her head . She had been watching poor damsels fall by the wayside ever since Sam hit his stride sometime in the seventh grade . Thank God she 'd built up a natural immunity by then . She tilted her head as he approached . The wind had ruffled his sand-colored hair , his green eyes shone and , though he rarely smiled , he somehow greeted everyone with warmth . He would make some girl a good catch . If not for his stubborn streak and cynical outlook , she herself might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes tinged with a curious note of censure . What was bothering him ? Had n't she just helped them win their first victory in weeks ? Ignoring the look , she let him pull her to her feet . " Good catch , " he said . " Good pass . " Her eyes wide , the brunette by his side plucked a tuft of grass from Crystal 's hair . " You were marvelous . My heart was in my throat . I did n't think you 'd make it , until you dove at the last minute . I could never dive into the ground like that . " " Thanks . " Crystal smiled a tight smile . No , this woman was n't the type to risk breaking one of her well-manicured nails . She seemed a bit on the fragile side , ethereal in her beauty . Crystal squelched the smidgen of envy that crept over her . What did she need with delicate beauty , when she 'd just scored the winning touchdown ? Grinning , she turned toward the crowd of familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Paige , who 'd warred through high school , then surprised them all by getting married right after college , beamed at her , their two-year-old daughter bouncing on Steels 's hip . " Hey , Crystal , that was awesome ! " Steels , his blond hair cropped close to his scalp , high-fived her with his free hand . " We 're naming number two after you . " Paige shook her own blond head as she rubbed the small bulge in her stomach . " I 'm not sure he would like that , but you were awesome , Crystal , just like always . Where 's that sister of yours ? " Frowning , Crystal scanned the remaining clusters of people . Had she been so wrapped up in Ron , she had n't noticed Megs had no-showed ? " She 's probably just busy with that man of hers . They spend all their free time together . " ( Continues ... )
