A family builds an idea-filled retreat on Washington 's Hood Canal Photograph Photograph // When the tide is in , it feels like you are hanging over the water , " Craig Schafer says of his home on Hood Canal , on Washington 's Olympic Peninsula . The 1,750-squarefoot vacation home is perched between the oyster shell-strewn shore and the steep , wooded hillside above . " The house is contemporary in many ways , but it feels like it has been there a long time , " Schafer says . He wanted a warm and inviting retreat , like an updated version of an old beach cottage . Architect Scott Wolf of the Miller/Hull Partnership explains the design : " We took a traditional conceptgabled , shingled forms-and gave it a modern sensibility . " Rooms overlap , and connections between inside and outside are accentuated to make the small house feel as spacious as possible . The open kitchen , dining room , and living roomwhich spills out onto two decks-is where Schafer , partner Lisa Mason , and their baby , Talia , spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canal . The ceiling stays at the same level in the three spaces , but the floor steps down toward the decks , following the slope of the site . There are two steps between the kitchen and the dining room and another two between the dining room and the living room . The result is a cozy kitchen with an 8-foot ceiling and an airy living room with a 13-foot ceiling . The space seems to expand toward the brick deck out back and the views beyond it . Some exterior materials are used on interior walls , creating a pleasing ambiguity between indoor and outdoor space . The dining room , for instance , with its cedar-shingle walls , feels like an outdoor room that has been enclosed . The sensation is enhanced by a large window on one side and generous-size folding glass doors that open to a deck on the other . " I like feeling as though I could pull the dining table halfway outside , " says Schafer . Reclaimed antique pine floorboards run throughout the home ; rustic and informal , they 're easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't want people to feel like they had to take off their shoes . It 's great for kids , adults , and pets , " Schafer says . A 750-square-foot boathouse , located about 30 yards up the shore from the home , sits next to the driveway . Barn doors on either end give Schafer the option of stopping and storing the boat inside , or driving through and launching the boat at the water 's edge . In the summer , the boat is moored in the water , and Schafer and Mason can open the barn doors and use the boathouse 's lower level as a cabana . A second-story bedroom allows the boathouse to double as a guest cottage .

For Craig Schafer , mornings on Hood Canal begin at 6 a.m . He drives to Hoodsport , a small town 8 miles south , and brings back newspapers for the couple to read by the water . * Time and tide . " What you are going to do each day and when you are going to do it is dictated by the weather and the tides , " Schafer says . " If the tide is out , we wo n't go out in the boat right away-the day might start with some yard work . " * To swim or not to swim . " The best days are when the tide is low and the sun heats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains Schafer . The water temperature , even in the middle of the canal , can reach 70-perfect for an afternoon of waterskiing . An outdoor shower attached to a driftwood post is perfect for washing off . * Dinner fresh from the water . The canal offers a rich array of shellfish , including oysters , clams , mussels , and Dungeness crab , which can go from water to table in less than two hours .

The two-story hallway acts as the organizing element ; its upper level leads to the master bedroom . The hall doubles as a conversation area with its own built-in seat , which lifts up to reveal a cedar-lined compartment for blanket storage . Even the most enclosed room , the master bathroom , feels airy and bright , thanks to a wall of windows .

Photograph Sidebar A time and place for getting away After a day spent boating , Craig Schafer stows his gear in the boathouse and then heads for the cabin , where he can relax and enjoy the sunset and water views from the porch and tiered deck , which resembles a broad stairway . Tall square planters , a large piece of driftwood , and lanterns frame the edges of the deck , turning it into an inviting outdoor space . A band of casement windows turns the master bedroom-directly above the living room and porch-into a sort of captain 's cabin . Schafer has been coming to Hood Canal since he was about 10 , when his parents had a small site where they pitched a tent in the summertime . // <p>
