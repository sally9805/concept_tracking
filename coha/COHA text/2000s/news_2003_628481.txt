<p> KLEIN OAK girls ' soccer coach Steve Simmons did n't have to think too long when asked how he felt after watching his team win the Class 5A state soccer championship . <p> " I want it to last forever , " said an emotional Simmons , who watched the Lady Panthers defeat Flower Mound Marcus 3-2 in a shootout to claim the school 's first-ever girls ' state title . " It feels great . I am so happy for the kids . They wanted it so bad . You could see it in there faces . " <p> After finishing second to The Woodlands in the final District 15-5A standings , the Lady Panthers were given little chance to make it out of the area round of the playoffs , yet alone win the state championship . <p> But , behind the sparkling play of freshman Laura Hopson and the outstanding goalkeeping of junior Lindsay White , Klein Oak won six straight one-goal matches to claim the state title . <p> " The second game of the season , Laura Hopson broke her leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little past midway through district , we did n't lose another game . Moving her back into the starting lineup enabled us to move some other people around . It really made us a complete team . " <p> Klein Oak had been to four previous state tournaments and two state championship matches before claiming the state crown . <p> Against Marcus , the Lady Panthers fell behind 1-0 before Alicia Reese tied it 1-1 to send the game into overtime and eventually into a winner-take-all shootout . <p> Cathy Sanchez kicked what proved to be the winning goal in the shootout . Klein Oak outscored Flower Mound Marcus 3-2 in the five-kick showdown to claim a 2-1 victory . <p> " By the time we got to the finals , we had a reputation of coming back after we got down , " said Simmons , who watched his team rally from a one-goal deficit in both state tournament matches . " They got up 1-0 and started playing very timid . They had fantastic skills . They were faster than us and better passers than us . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we started taking over the game . " <p> White , who was named the state tournament 's most valuable player , stopped three of Marcus ' five shootout kicks , including a boot from Flower Mound 's national team player , Simmons said . <p> " When a national team player misses a penalty kick , that is unbelievable , " Simmons said . " When she missed it , I thought to myself : ' We are going to win this game . ' You have to take advantage of the opportunities you get . We did n't have a lot of opportunities , but the ones we got , we took advantage of them . " <p> The Lady Panthers are sending 10 seniors on to college scholarships off this year 's team , including Reese to Sam Houston State University , Laura Barber to Rice and Tanya Hopson to the University of Lousiana-Lafayette . <p> Barber , Rice and Laura Hopson were the team 's leading goal scorers during the 2003 campaign . Barber , in fact , had all three assists in the state tournament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these girls were only freshmen , " Simmons said . " I am the only high school coach they have every had . It has been really special to watch them progress and grow as a team . It was a fantastic feeling to watch them end their careers with a state title . " <p> Klein Oak , which finished the season 21-6-2 , advanced to the state finals with a 2-1 victory over Clements in the semifinals . The Lady Panthers trailed 1-0 in the contest before Hopson scored in the 63rd minute to tie the match 1-1 . Reese scored on a header with 4:24 left in the match to propel the Lady Panthers into the championship match . <p> " Laura Hopson and our goalie ( White ) are about the only two full-time players coming back next year , " Simmons said . " But we have a great group of freshmen and sophomores coming up . We also had a couple juniors get squeezed this year because of our senior class . Katrina Cousins would be a star on about 90 percent of other teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she will be a big star for us next year . " <p> White , midfielder Lindsey Abel , defender Barber and forward Megan Duesing all were named to the Class 5A all-state tournament team . <p> White also will be back for her third stint in goal . She had 20 shutouts last year . <p> " Last year , we were very defensive-minded , " Simmons said . " This year , we decided to be a little more risk takers and not concentrate so much on the shutouts . We allowed some goals , but we pushed the attack more . Her stats may not look as good , but she played just as good . " <p> The Lady Panthers finished the season with a 13-match winning streak . It won six straight 2-1 decisions in postseason play , and eight straight one-goal contests to win the title . <p> Klein Oak was 8-6-2 at one time this season before catching fire during the second half of district play and the playoffs . The Lady Panthers have qualified for the Class 5A state playoffs 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state champion Plano West 1-0 to win the Region II title and advance to the state tournament . It was Plano West 's first loss in 24 playoff matches . <p> " One of the things we enjoyed this year was that I think we snuck up on a lot of people , " Simmons said . " Even going into state , knowing we had knocked off Plano West , nobody gave us much respect . They had n't heard of Klein Oak in the rankings . But we snuck up on them .
