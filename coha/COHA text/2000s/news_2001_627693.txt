<p> PASADENA , Calif. - Take a close look at television and you 'll find that while men are everywhere , so are women . And in roles , fact and fiction , just as powerful . <p> Josiah Bartlett ( The West Wing ) may be our ruler , but Buffy Summers ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) protects our backs . For every Bobby Donnell ( The Practice ) , there 's an Ally McBeal . Dr. Sydney Hansen ( Providence ) has a bedside manner equal to or greater than Dr. Mark Greene 's ( ER ) . <p> Here in the shadows of the Hollywood hills , women such as Fox Entertainment chief Gail Berman and Sabrina producer Paula Hart are making an imprint on what we see on television . Just as forcefully , women such as Gillian Anderson and Bette Midler capture our attention for what they do in front of the camera lens . <p> As members of the Television Critics Association continue their biannual meeting with industry executives and celebrities , women are making as many headlines and sound bytes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent this trip : women of color . Noticeably absent every trip : women of color in power positions . ) <p> Here 's what the women of Hollywood are saying . <p> Amy Brenneman , Judge Amy Gray , Judging Amy . On whether she 'd rather be up against Once &; Again or NYPD Blue : " NYPD Blue is better counterprogramming . Actually , I think all three shows are very different . " On what she likes about her character : " I love that we never seem to land in one mood too long . If I look at any one script , I usually get something really funny to do . She 's very smart but she did something very stupid , which is very human . And coming up , she gets to have sex ( with a 23-year-old model-turned-actor Tom Welling ) ! It 's just a very full experience . " <p> Barbara Hall , executive producer , Judging Amy . On whether Brenneman 's real-life pregnancy ( she 's due in March ) will be worked into the show : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show - it completely changes the tenor . We wanted to prove we could do a series about women and not about sex . So that 's why I laugh and say , ' Thank God for that robe . ' " <p> Tyne Daly , Maxine Gray , Judging Amy . On whether Richard Crenna will be back : " He 'll be back for two more episodes this season . The notion of sex after 60 is intriguing to a lot of people , including me . " <p> Bette Midler , Bette . On what TV work is like : " I 've never encountered such a pace before . The turnaround is very fast , and they keep giving you new material until the lights go out . It 's very hard to judge what you 're doing . It 's also very hard to learn so much new material every week . It 's like doing a little Broadway show every week . I had no idea it was going to be that hard . . . . I love what I 'm doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> On getting guest stars to appear : " Once you get the people , it 's great . It 's making the calls , doing the follow-ups , making the deals - that 's the hard part . Getting them to say yes , that 's the hard part . Once they get on the set , they 're great , we have a good time . Like Oprah . Danny DeVito really did me a solid . Dolly ( Parton ) , that was a lot of fun . Some people just do n't want to come . So if a writer has a pipe dream , says we need to get Mel Gibson for this , there 's no . . . way Mel 's going to come . " <p> On why Kevin Dunn , who played Bette 's husband , left the show : " He wanted to be let go . He was very unhappy with the material he was given . I thought he was a terrific husband , but it just was n't his cup of tea . He was unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just yet . I 'm very timid about getting involved with another actor I 'm not sure of . I personally feel every week we should have a different Roy . We should say , ' And this week , as Roy , Fred Willard , ' and ' This week , as Roy , Martin Short , ' and ' This week , as Roy , Chris Rock . ' That 's what I think . But this is a very serious business world ; people really take this ( stuff ) seriously . You really have to think this stuff through because apparently people care . ( She laughs big . ) I think it 's hilarious . " <p> Nancy Tellem , president , CBS Entertainment . On the husband situation on Bette : " I appreciate Bette wanting different husbands every week . . . . But , you know , we 're trying to make the series as realistic as we can , and we are currently looking to cast a husband . I think we 're going to end up with only one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On how often she must tell people , " I 'm not like her , " meaning Lois : " I had a wake-up call the other day . My husband ( Bradley Whitford ) was on Rosie and she asked him if I was like that woman . Brad said , ' She 's exactly like that woman . ' And ( later ) I said , ' Honey , you know , you need to say that in a way that people know you 're being more sarcastic . The way you said that sounded like you meant it . ' And he said , ' I do mean it . ' So that kind of took me aback . You know , I have a 3-year-old and a 1-year-old , so it 's a different kind of chaos in my house than it is taking care of four boys . I am a loud , opinionated , judgmental woman . " ( She laughed . ) <p> Susanne Daniels , president , WB Entertainment . On whether , in the upcoming special ( and future series ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the would-be brides say no : " Of course not . " Told it might be a lot more fun : " Of course not . " <p> Kate Mulgrew , Capt . Kathryn Janeway , Star Trek : Voyager . On the Voyager legacy : " I would both selfishly and quite proudly say that being the first female commander has been both pioneering and rather unprecedented , a very bold move . I think it has proven to be timely , wise and deeply encouraging culturally . " <p> Gillian Anderson , Agent Dana Scully , The X-Files . On the X-Files workload : " It 's been hard this season , especially for Robert ( Patrick , who plays Agent John Doggett ) , who 's done something like 54 films and was accustomed to a slower pace and more rehearsal time . So there 's been some adjusting there . And it 's been difficult in many ways for the writers . " <p> Gail Berman , president , Fox Entertainment . On The X-Files ' ninth season : " We are contracted with Gillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to start talks with Chris ( Carter ) about next year as well . We feel the show has taken on a tremendous new energy this year . We 're certainly hoping it will continue next year . " <p> Paula Hart , executive producer , Sabrina , the Teen-age Witch . On the future of Sabrina : " So far we 've done episodes on bigotry , cheating scandals and sororities . We 're not preaching ; they 're only plot points . Coming up will be an episode on spring break , and Frankie Avalon is going to guest star . And we 'll have a show on athletic scholarships . And Sabrina will become a student activist . It 's been a great season . We love the WB ! " <p> In addition to Sabrina , Sabrina TV movies , the Sabrina animated series and Sabrina merchandise , Hart will helm a pilot starring her daughter ( Melissa Joan 's sister ) Emily : " It 's set at a school for magically challenged witches . Instead of a talking cat , there 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not animatronic like Salem . " <p> Caroline Rhea , Aunt Hilda , Sabrina , the Teenage Witch . On whether she 'll be able to continue starring in Sabrina . . . as well as regularly appearing on Hollywood Squares . . . as well as hosting a daytime talk show next season : " I 'll still be able to do Sabrina , but I guess I 'll have to drop out of Squares . " On Emily Hart : " She 's a total babe now - so beautiful . " <p> TYPE : - LINKS-  ; Television Review
