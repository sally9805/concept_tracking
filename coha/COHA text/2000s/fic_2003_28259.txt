ONE She was being followed . She paused and wiped a damp wisp of yellow hair from her forehead , touching in passing the scars that marked her as a member of Domain Kwaad . Her green eyes scanned through the many-legged gnarltrees , but her stalkers were n't yet showing themselves to the usual senses . They were waiting for somethingreinforcements , probably . She hissed a mild shaper 's curse under her breath and started off again , picking her way over moldering logs , through sluggish mists and dense brakes of hissing cane . The air was a wet fever , and the chirps and trills and bubbling gulps from canopy and marsh were oddly comforting . She kept her pace the samethere was no reason to let them know she was on to them , not yet . She did alter her path subtlyno point in going to the cave until this was dealt with . Or I could lead them there , she mused , attack them while they deal with their inner demons . . . No . That seemed somehow like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and so had Anakin . Now it was her turn . Tahiri 's turn . Anakin 's parents had n't very much liked the idea of her coming to Dagobah alone , but she 'd managed to convince them of the necessity . She believed that the human and Yuuzhan Vong personalities that had once shared her body had become one seamless entity . It felt that way , felt right . But Anakin had seen a vision of her , a melding of Jedi and Yuuzhan Vong , and it had n't been a pretty vision . She 'd thought at first , after the joining that had nearly driven her mad , that she had avoided that outcome . But before she moved on , before she put those she loved at risk , she had to considerthe possibility that the fusion of Tahiri Veila with Riina of Domain Kwaad was a step in the fulfillment of that vision . Anakin , after all , had known her better than anyone . And Anakin had been very strong . If the creature he had seen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , not later . So she 'd come here , to Dagobah , where the Force was so strong it almost seemed to sing aloud . The cycle of life and death and new birth was all around here , none of it twisted by Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology , none of it poisoned by the machines , greed , and exploitation all too native to this galaxy . She 'd come to visit the cave to explore her inner self and see what she was really made of . But she had also come to Dagobah to meditate on the alternatives . What Anakin had seen was all of the worst of Yuuzhan Vong and Jedi traits bundled into one being . Avoiding becoming that was paramount , but she had a goal beyondto find the balance , to embody the best of her mixed heritage . Not just for herself , but because the reconciliation of her dual identity had left her with one firm beliefthat the Yuuzhan Vong and the peoples of the galaxy they had invaded could learn a lot from each other , and they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only question was how to make it happen . The Yuuzhan Vong would never create industrial wastelands like Duro , Bonadan , or Eriadu . On the other hand , what they did to lifebreaking it and twisting it until it suited their needs , wiping it out entirely when it did n't pleasewas really no better . It was n't that they loved life , but that they hated machines . There had to be some sort of common ground , some pivot point that could open the eyes of both sides and end the ongoing terror and destruction of the war . The Force was key to that understanding . The Yuuzhan Vong were somehow blind to it . If they could actually feel the Force around them , if they could feel the wrongness of their creations , they might find a better path , one less bent on destruction . If the Jedi could feel the Yuuzhan Vong in the Force , they might findnot better ways to fight thembut paths to conciliation . She needed more than that , though . It was n't enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make things right . Tahiri had no delusions of grandeur . She was no savior , no prophet , no super-Jedi . She was the result of a Yuuzhan Vong experiment gone wrong . But she did understand both sides of the problem , and if there was any chance she could help Master Skywalker find the solution her galaxy so desperately neededwell , she had to take it . It was a role she accepted with humility and great caution . Those trying to do good often committed the most atrocious crimes . They were gaining on her , getting clumsier . Soon she would have to do something . They must have followed her to Dagobah . How ? Or maybe they had known where she was going before she left . Maybe she had been betrayed . But that meant Han and Leia No . There was another answer . Paranoid reflexes were a survival trait growing up in a crche , but even deeper instincts told her that her friendsadopted parents , almostcould never do such a thing . Someone had been watching her , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would imagine they could curry a lot of favor by turning her over to Shimrra . She twisted her way through a maze of gnarltrees and then clambered quickly and silently up their cablelike roots . They had once been legs , those roots , as she 'd learned when she came here less than a decade and more than a lifetime ago . The immature form of the tree was a sort of spider that lost its mobility in adulthood . She 'd been with Anakin , here to face his trial , to discover if having the name of his grandfather would bring him the same fate . I miss you Anakin , she thought . More now than ever . About four meters off the ground , she secreted herself in a hollow and waited . If she could simply avoid them , she would . At one level her instincts cried out for battle , but at a deeper level she knew that her Yuuzhan Vong fighting reflexes had inevitable connections with fury , and she was here to avoid becoming Anakin 's vision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan that she had n't told Han and Leia aboutthe part where , if the cave confirmed her worst fears , she would cripple her X-wing beyond repair and spend the rest of her life on the jungle planet . Perhaps , like the spiders , she would sink her limbs into the swamp and become a tree . She reached out with the Force , to better assess her pursuit . They were n't there . And she suddenly realized that she had n't felt them in the Force , but with her Vongsense . It had come so naturally she had n't even questioned it . That could only mean her pursuers were Yuuzhan Vong , maybe six of them , give or take one or two . Vongsense was n't as precise as the Force . She reached for her lightsaber , but did n't unhook it , and continued to wait . Soon she actually heard them . Whoever they were , they were n't huntersthey moved through the jungle clumsily , and though they pitched their voices low enough that she could n't actually understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly . They must be very confident of their success . A dark shadow glided soundlessly through the undergrowth , and she snapped her gaze up in time to see something very large blot the fragments of sky not occluded by the distant canopy . Native life , or a Yuuzhan Vong flier ? Pursing her lips , she waited . Soon the distant muttering became coherent . As she 'd thought , the language was that of her crche . Are you certain she came this way ? a raspy voice asked . She did . See ? The impression in the moss ? She is Jeedai . Perhaps she left these signs to confuse us . Perhaps . But you think she is near ? Yes . And knows we are following her ? Yes . Then why not simply call out to her ? And hope I answer the battle challenge ? Tahiri thought , grimly . So they did have a tracker with them . Could she slip around them , back to her X-wing ? Or must she fight them ? Moving very slowly , Tahiri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make out several figures through the understory , but not distinctly . At some point we must , I suppose , the tracker said . Else she will think we wish her harm . What ? Tahiri frowned , trying to fit that into her presuppositions . She could n't . Jeedai ! the tracker called . I think you can hear us . We humbly request an audience . No warrior would do that , Tahiri thought . No warrior would use such honorless trickery . But a shaper . . . Yes , a shaper or a priest might , a member of the deception sect . Still She leaned out for a better view , and found herself staring straight into the yellow eyes of a Yuuzhan Vong . He was perhaps six meters away . She gasped at the sight of him , and revulsion jolted through her . His face was like an open wound . A Shamed One , despised by the gods . He daredher hand went to her lightsaber . Then the shadow was back , and suddenly something sleeted through the branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snarled a war cry and ignited her weapon , swirling it up to send two thud bugs burning off through the jungle . Above her , through the now open canopy , she saw a Yuuzhan Vong tsik vai , an atmospheric flier , huge and ray-shaped , and from it snaked long cables . To each cable clung a Yuuzhan Vong warrior . One passed less than two meters from her , and she braced for the fight , but he went on past , oblivious to her presence , striking the jungle floor and uncoiling his amphistaff in the same motion . A terrible wail went up from her pursuers . She could see them now , all horribly disfigured , all Shamed Ones . They raised their short clubs and faced the warriors . They did n't have a chanceshe saw that immediately . For an instant , the tracker held her eye , and she thought he would give her away , but instead his expression went grim . Run ! he shouted . We can not win here ! Tahiri hesitated only an instant longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first of the Shamed Ones had already fallen when her feet touched the spongy soil . A warrior caught her motion from the corner of his eye and turned to meet her , snarling a war cry . His face transfigured in surprise when she answered it in his own language . He whirled his amphistaff toward her , a lateral strike aimed at her scapula . She caught the blade and cut toward his knuckles , but he parried with distance , pulled his weapon free of the bind , and lunged deep with the venomous tip . She caught it in a high sweep and stepped in , cut to his shoulder where the vonduun crab armor shed its fury in a shower of sparks , then dodged past , reversing the weapon and plunging its fiery point into the vulnerable spot in the armpit . The warrior gasped and sank to his knees , and she whipped the weapon around to decapitate him even as she launched herself at the next foe . Combat was a blur , after that . Eight warriors had dropped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shamed Ones were bleeding on the ground . She had an image of the tracker , his arms knotted in a neck-breaking hold . She saw another Shamed One strike a warrior on the temple with his club only to be run through from behind . Mostly she saw the lightning-quick amphistaff strikes of the two warriors trying to flank her . She cut at a knee , smelled the scorch of flesh as the blade severed through armor . An amphistaff whipped toward her back and she had to roll beneath the blow . Parry , thrust , and cut became her entire existence . Spattered with Yuuzhan Vong blood and bleeding from several cuts of her own , she suddenly found herself back to back with the tracker . He was all that remained of the six who had initially been following her , but there remained only three warriors . For a moment , they stood like that . The warriors backed away a bit . The leader was massive . His ears were cut into fractal patterns ; great trenchlike scars stood on his cheeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one-who-was-shaped . Is it true what they say ? These pathetic maw luur excretions worship you ? I do n't know anything about that , Tahiri said . But I know when I see a dishonorable fight . They were not only outnumbered , but poorly armed . How can you call yourselves warriors , to attack in such a way ? They are Shamed Ones , the warrior sneered back . They are outside honor . They are worse than infidels ; they are heretic traitors , not to be fought but to be exterminated . You fear us , the tracker rasped . You fear us because we know the truth . You lap at Shimrra 's feet , yet Shimrra is the true heretic . See how this Jeedai has laid you low . The gods favor her , not you . If the gods favor her , they do not favor you , the warrior snapped . They are delaying us , the tracker told Tahiri . She noticed he had blood on his lips . They delay us while another tsik vai arrives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may yet live to snivel a little longer . There are questions we would ask of you . His expression softened . Renounce your heresy . This Jeedai is a great prize . Help us win her , and perhaps the gods will forgive you and grant you an honorable death . No death is more honorable than dying by the side of a Jeedai , the tracker answered . Vua Rapuung proved that . Vua Rapuung , the warrior all but spat . That story is a heretic 's lie . Vua Rapuung died in disgrace . For answer the Shamed One suddenly bolted forward , so quickly he took the leader by surprise , bowling into him before he could raise his weapon . The other two turned to help , but Tahiri danced forward , feinting at the knee and then cutting high through the warrior 's throat when he dropped his guard to parry . She exchanged a flurry of blows with the second , though it ended the same , with the warrior flopping lifeless to the ground . She turned to find the tracker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment they stared at each other , the Shamed One and she . Then the Yuuzhan Vong suddenly dropped to his knees . I prayed it was you ! he said . Tahiri opened her mouth , but heard the stir of treetops that could only be another flier arriving . Come on , she said . We ca n't stay here . The warrior nodded and bounded to his feet . Together they ran from the clearing . An hour or so later , Tahiri finally halted . The fliers seemed to have lost them for the time being , and the tracker had been gradually dropping behind . Now he staggered against a tree and slid to the ground . A little farther , she said . Just over here . My legs will no longer bear me , the tracker said . You must leave me for the time being . Just under this shelf of stone , she said . Please . It may hide us from the fliers if they sweep here . He nodded wearily . She saw he was clutching his side , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overhang . Let me see that , she said . He shook his head . I must speak to you first , he said . What are you doing here ? Did you follow me ? His eyes widened . No ! he said , so vehemently that blood sputtered from between his lips . Then , more quietly , No . We thieved a ship from an intendant and came here to find the world of prophecy . We saw you landis this the place , one-who-was-shaped ? Is this the world the Prophet saw ? I 'm sorry , Tahiri said . I do n't know what you mean . This is Dagobah . I came here for . . . personal reasons . But it can not be coincidence , the tracker said . It can not . Please , Tahiri said . Let me see your wound . I know a little about healing . Maybe I can I am dead already , the tracker gruffed . I know this . But I must know if I have failed . Tahiri shook her head helplessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am Hul Qat , once a hunter . Or I was , until the gods seemed to reject me . I was stripped of my title , my clan . I was Shamed . My implants festered and my scars opened like wounds . I gave up hope and waited for dishonorable death . But then I heard the word of the Prophet , and of the Jeedai Anakin Anakin , Tahiri whispered . The name twisted a blade in her . Yes , and you , whom Mezhan Kwaad shaped . And Vua Rapuung who foughtyou were there , were you not ? A deep chill ran through Tahiri . She had been Riina , then , and Tahiri , and she had nearly killed Anakin . I was there . Then you know . You know our redemption belongs with you . And now the Prophet has seen a world , a world where there are no Shamed Ones because it will redeem us , where the true way can be He coughed violently and slumped again , and for an instant Tahiri thought he was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My companions and I wanted to find the planet for our Prophet . One of us , Kuhqo , had been a shaper . He used a genetic slicer to get access to an executor 's qahsa and steal its secrets . He found intelligence gathered about the Jeedai , and evidence that there was some connection between you and this world . Some of your greatest came here , yes ? And now you . And so please , tell me . Have I found it ? He shuddered , and his eyes rolled . Have I ? he begged again , so weakly this time it might have been no more than a breath . Tahiri reached out and took his hand . Yes , she lied , not even knowing exactly what lie she was telling . Yes , you 're right . You found it . Do n't worry about anything now . His eyes filled with tears . You must help me , he said . I can not take the news myself . The Prophet must know where this world is . I will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying . Hul Qat closed his eyes , and even without using the Force , Tahiri felt him leave . Tahiri glanced at the opening of the cave , so near , and she knew that was not what she had come for at all . This was why she had come . The Force had brought her here , to meet this man , to make this promise . She rose . The fliers would find her if she remained still for too long . She hoped they had n't discovered her ship yet , but figured the odds were against it , since they had n't been looking for her and she had concealed it pretty well . Even so , she might have a little trouble getting out of the system , depending on how many and what sort of ships were orbiting overhead . It did n't matter , though . She had a promise to keep . Even if she could figure out exactly what she had promised .                  @ @ @
