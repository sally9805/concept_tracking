<p> TELEVISION REVIEW <p> ' STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIP ' <p> Rating 3 1/2 out of 4 <p> 9 to 10 p.m . Mondays on WMAQ-Channel 5 <p> In " Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip , " a comedy writer snaps at a TV executive : " I have no reason to trust you and every reason not to  --  you work in television . " <p> Many actors may cheer this line . But will viewers be willing to follow such inside baseball and behind-the-scenes machinations ? <p> I think they will . Hollywood is Topic A for many Americans . I have been puzzled by some TV critics who question whether people will sign up to watch interoffice struggles in this new NBC drama , debuting on Monday . It details relationships between actors , writers and suits at a " Saturday Night Live " - type show named " Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip . " <p> In July , co-star Bradley Whitford suggested viewers are addicted to workplace shows . <p> " Whenever I hear that question , I just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' " <p> Viewers get glimpses of the daily lives of Matt ( Matthew Perry ) and Danny ( Whitford ) , two comedy writers who take over the reins of " Studio 60 . " Matt and Danny 's champion is network executive Jordan ( Amanda Peet ) . It 's a sticky situation for Matt because his most recent ex , Harriet ( Sarah Paulson ) , is an actress on " Studio 60 . " His buddy Danny is a recovering drug addict . <p> There are many more plot points . The show was created by Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme , the chatty guys from " The West Wing . " So , characteristic of Sorkin and Schlamme , " Studio " unfolds with a large ensemble cast talking in Sorkin-esque dialogue , crisply defining themselves as three-dimensional men and women rushing around in a rough-and-tumble industry . <p> Schlamme 's direction is strong and steady . The actors make him look even smarter . Perry and Whitford are a compelling team . Peet is fantastic . She plays Jordan as an unflappable executive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is not a bitch . She is not a crybaby . <p> Peet 's Jordan is a confident woman who stands toe-to-toe with her mean boss Jack ( Steven Weber , at right ) as a matter of calm self-belief . It would be understandable if some viewers believe Peet is merely smiling and staring rather than acting . But take a close look . She is creating Jordan with a casual intensity that implies Jordan is so genuinely sure , she is unconcerned by people who do n't believe in her abilities and decisions . <p> And Weber ( at left ) is remarkable . Other actors may have turned Jack into a cardboard cutout of a crank . Weber sees Jack as a man who has gotten his way so long , he 's flying in heed-my-wisdom autopilot . When Jordan says something he does n't like , he pauses then comically sucks air in between his teeth . It 's the slightest behavior that quietly broadcasts power . <p> Despite its multitude of personalities and conflicting motivations , " Studio 60 " is easy to follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will likely enjoy " Studio 60 . " And there should be enough mature viewers who crave bright writing to make the show a sudden mainstay . I hope so . <p> delfman@suntimes.com <p> TV 'S GUTSY GOODS <p> ' Studio 60 " begins with a frustrated producer complaining on live TV that the medium caters to 12-year-old boys and has become " lobotomized by a candy-ass broadcast network . " There is some validity to this point . TV is crammed with copycats ( how many " CSIs " are there , now , 14 ? ) and copycraps ( " Nanny 911 , " " Supernanny " ) . <p> But networks also deserve credit . Healthy competition between cable and broadcasters has motivated executives to support a good number of high-quality series , and some chancy ones . What 's more , some critics believe this year 's new shows comprise the best fall season , collectively , in years or even decades . <p> If you think about it , prime-time TV does have some guts : <p> - NBC honchos are propelling shows that lampoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive speech in " Studio 60 " will air on NBC , which is heavily promoting the provocative show . And in NBC 's " 30 Rock , " Alec Baldwin plays a meddlesome goof who works for General Electric , NBC 's parent company . <p> - This fall , ABC is n't launching any conventional sitcoms , turning instead to new single-camera comedies . That 's mildly risky . Broadcasters have ramped up the number of comedies that are single camera ( no studio audience ) , despite the cancellation of Fox 's little-watched " Arrested Development " and the long time it took for " The Office " to get big viewer numbers . This proves they 're dedicated to a fresher format that defies easy ratings . <p> - Instead of presenting only happy , friendly characters , several new shows center around unlikable , frumpy or villainous protagonists . Showtime 's " Dexter " stars a creepy charmer , a serial murderer . The thieves of CBS ' " Smith " are portrayed almost objectively as sociopaths and murderers . All the lawyers in Fox 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent hoodlums of NBC 's " The Black Donnellys " ( coming in January ) do very bad things . These series join a landscape already peopled with grumps on Fox 's " House , " and HBO 's biggest hits . <p> - One Fox cable station , FX , is dedicated to original series that are offbeat and do n't pander to common denominators . " Nip/Tuck " and " Rescue Me " are brilliant , funny and touching , and written for mature audiences . " The Shield " dares viewers to follow the evil exploits of bad cops . And " It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia " boldly deals with storylines about men trying to score women at abortion-clinic protests and such . <p> - Fox continues to champion the funny and smart " The Simpsons " and " Family Guy , " even as both cartoons mock Fox and TV culture . " Arrested Development " poked fun at Fox , too , and the network kept the great comedy airing for three seasons despite very poor ratings . <p> - HBO 's " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's packed with dozens of characters , many with their own multipart story lines . It 's so intricate in tone and conversations that some critics compare it to literature , rather than TV . <p> - In the past week , CBS and ABC took big gambles . CBS aired a 9/11 special that included curse words , even though it would invite clamoring for FCC fines . ABC ran a fictionalized , commercial-free 9/11 movie , despite a protest campaign by liberals and progressives . Whether or not you agree with the decisions  --  or even if you judge them as arrogant  --  they illustrate networks ' refusal to back from viewer and critical backlash , or potential financial losses . <p> - And Comedy Central is TV 's treasure chest of grown-up political and social comedy , with " South Park , " " The Daily Show " and " The Colbert Report . " Its upcoming " Freak Show " is a fantastical cartoon satire co-starring a premature baby . That does n't sound candy-ass to me . <p> Doug Elfman <p> MUST-SEE TV <p> SUNDAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Creek " : Tonight 's the last night of the WB network , so they bid farewell with the pilot episodes of two popular favorites. 6 and 8 p.m. , WGN-Channel 9 <p> MONDAY <p> " Deal or No Deal " : The season premiere of the surprise hit game show involving models , briefcases and contestants who do n't know when to quit . 7 p.m. , WMAQ-Channel 5 <p> TUESDAY <p> " Boston Legal " : Season premiere of quirky , award-winning legal drama features cases about lungs and sex dolls . 9 p.m. , WLS-Channel 7 <p> WEDNESDAY <p> " Jericho " : There 's no place like home in this new drama  --  until the nuclear bombs go off .
