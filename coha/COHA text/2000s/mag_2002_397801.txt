// Killer microbes that threaten tens of thousands of lives lurk in the unlikeliest of places : the hospital The Edmondsons of Rocklin , Calif. , are a family obsessed-at least on Sundays . That 's when oldest daughter Jenna , 17 , a star defensive player on the Placer United Spirits soccer squad , can invariably be found kicking and head-butting her way down the field , with her parents , Jim and Tami , both 40 , raucously cheering her on . Jenna has a reputation as a competitor with a killer edge , and she rarely lets her teammates down . " I like taking people out , " she says . " I like to tackle . " Photograph Original Condition : Torn knee ligaments Complication : Pseudomonas infection " Hospitals should care about people instead of trying to cut corners , " says Jenna Edmondson , 17 ( at home in Rocklin , Calif. , this month and , right , laid up in 2001 ) . // But Edmondson 's on-the-field feistiness landed her in serious trouble during a tournament game in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she collided with another player and felt a pop in her right knee , followed by a jolt of agonizing pain . Diagnosed with torn ligaments , Edmondson had routine surgery on Aug. 31 , 2001 , at the Sutter Roseville Medical Center in Roseville , Calif . Her recovery , however , was anything but routine . In and out of the doctor 's office for four months , the high school junior lost 15 lbs . and suffered from high fevers and nearly constant pain in her knee before a biopsy finally revealed an infection caused by the germ pseudomonas aeruginosa-a microscopic warrior that , like a demonic Pac Man , eats away at bone and tissue . According to Jim , Jenna 's surgeon said she had likely picked up the bug at the hospital . With that , the Edmondsons , who coown two small businesses , hit the roof . " We saw this healthy , vibrant young lady go through something that she should n't have had to endure , " says Tami , who helped the oldest of her three girls through six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a second operation to remove dead tissue . Jenna has now fully recovered but says her year on the bench has undermined her chances for a college athletic scholarship-not to mention her faith in doctors . In July her family sued Sutter Roseville Medical Center for negligence , contending it failed to maintain adequate infectioncontrol procedures ( the hospital declines to comment because the case is still pending ) . " When your hospital fails you , " says Tami , " you feel helpless . " Photograph Original Condition : Heart disease Complications : Antibiotic-resistant staph infections More than 100 plaintiffs ( including , from left , Sharon Pauly , Herb Jarrett , Dorothea Glass and Lorraine Lydon ) claim unsanitary conditions at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center in Florida lead to a deadly outbreak . // Yet as rough as the Edmondsons had it , the outcome for Jenna could have been far worse . Each year hospital-acquired infections kill an estimated 100,000 Americans , making them the fifth-most common cause of death in this country after heart disease , cancer , stroke and respiratory ailments . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious risks posed by the germs that prey on hospital patients , despite publicity given to such recent cases as Rosie O'Donnell 's bout with staph after hand surgery in New York City . Health care facilities are understandably loath to disclose the problem-one malpractice lawyer calls it the industry 's " dirty little secret "  --  and state health codes rarely require it . " Patients do n't understand just how common these infections are , " says Dr. Brent C. James , coauthor of a landmark 1999 study on hospital mishaps . " They 're painful , " says James bluntly . " They kill . " That was the case during an outbreak of infection at an Oklahoma City hospital eventually traced to pseudomonas germs found under the long fingernails of three nurses ; it killed 16 newborns between 1997 and ' ' 98 . In Brooklyn , an anesthesiologist infected 19 patients with potentially deadly hepatitis C last spring by reusing tainted vials and needles . And last year in Evanston , Ill. , two women were attacked by flesh-eating bacteria after having cesarean sections . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mary Adkins , 45-year-old twin sisters from Baltimore , fight back tears as they describe seven months spent nursing their elderly mother , Mary Carmella Wallace , following back surgery and a stroke , only to lose her to a staph infection that apparently entered her body through poorly treated bedsores . The worst part , they say , was the reluctance of doctors and nurses to discuss the cause of the painful affliction even as it took over their mother 's body . " We found out by accident , " says Adkins . " One day we came into the hospital and there was a quarantine sign on her door and the nurse was putting on a mask and gloves . " Wallace , 72 , died last January . ( For advice on protecting yourself from hospital infections , see page 69 . ) While acknowledging that killer germs can lurk in almost any hospital , public health officials and hospital administrators contend that the infections they cause almost always prey on elderly and seriously ill patients in the grips of chronic and sometimes terminal diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Disease Control and Prevention 's health care quality division , says , " The bottom line is , we 're dealing with very , very sick people who are getting very strong immune-suppressing medications or who undergo multiple invasive procedures like catheters that enter into the body and make them much more susceptible to infections . " Dr. Dennis Maki , chief of infectious diseases at the University of Wisconsin Medical School , adds that most victims would not even be alive and at a hospital if it were n't for recent medical breakthroughs that extend life longer than ever before . " Infections today are a consequence of the advances of medicine , " says Maki . " There is no free lunch .

Photograph PATIENTS ' BEST DEFENSE Since human error may account for up to half of the 2 million infections contracted in hospitals each year , patients should take an active role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you leave the hospital at least as healthy as you arrived : * Do your homework . When choosing a surgeon , do n't be embarrassed to ask whether former patients have contracted infections . * Hand washing can kill up to 99 percent of all known bacteria . Insist that doctors and nurses wash their hands before touching you . * Do n't go it alone . Patients accompanied by family or friends who keep an eye on their care are less likely to fall prey to mishaps. * Catheters and Vs are a common point of entry for germs ; they should be removed when no longer needed . Ask whether it 's time to take them out * Overuse of antibiotics is one of the most dangerous factors behind hard-W treat infections . Ask whether antibiotics are right for you and take them exactly as prescribed . // But to other experts , the toll from hospital-acquired infections remains unconscionably high-especially since so many are preventable . " There 's a tremendous amount of human error out there , " says Georgia Dash , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates that as many as half of all such illnesses could be avoided through strict compliance with known sanitary procedures . Perhaps the most effective is simply washing hands between patients , a practice that kills 99 percent of bacteria and takes less than a minute . And yet because of cost-saving cuts at many hospitals , overworked staffers now often complain they simply do n't have time . " When the staff is overwhelmed , " says Elaine Larson , a nursing and public health professor at Columbia University who keeps close tabs on the profession , " they are definitely more likely to make mistakes . " Indeed , a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last May linked nursing shortages with a wide range of infections . An even more frightening trend is the rapid evolution of germs so virulent that the most powerful antibiotics available today are becoming ineffective at fighting them . Two years ago , retired teacher Sharon Pauly , a competitive golfer with a four handicap , checked into a hospital near her home in Palm Beach Gardens , Fla. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention she received , Pauly , now 65 , a divorced mother of three , enlisted help from her family circle . " A friend was bathing me , " she says . " My son took me to the bathroom . " Somehow , staph microbes penetrated the wound in her chest , igniting an infection that threatens to flare up at any time . " I was told I could have it the rest of my life , " says Pauly , who has undergone 14 operations to treat the illness , known as MRSA ( for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ) . So little remains of her sternum that Pauly must wear a bullet-proof vest when driving to protect against a sudden inflation of her air bag , which could crush her heart . Twenty years ago her infection might easily have been knocked out with penicillin . But today overuse of antibiotics-caused both by doctors who prescribe them as a cure-all and patients who demand them at the first sign of a sore throat-has allowed microbes to mutate into new organisms that can survive even the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between man and microbe , " says Dr. Victor Yu , chief of infectious diseases at Pittsburgh 's Veteran Affairs Medical Center , " and the microbe is winning today . " Reacting in part to a twofold rise in the rate of MRSA infection in the past decade , last March the CDC issued a 12-point memorandum to physicians that stresses more selective use of antibiotics . The agency has set a 10-year goal to cut hospital infections by half . Hospitals are facing another sort of challenge as well . Last April Sharon Pauly joined 105 former cardiac surgery patients at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center who are suing the 204-bed facility for allegedly failing to detect and contain debilitating infections . Collectively , the plaintiffs seek millions of dollars in damages . The hospital declines to discuss the cases but has denied the charges in court papers .

Doctors fought furiously to save her preemies , both of whom were infected in the womb . But on Aug. 12 , 2001 , less than a month into his life , little Adrian Johnson was pronounced dead from blood poisoning and respiratory failure . " It does n't make any sense , " says Johnson , still aching from the ordeal as she and her husband , William , 33 , a computer technician , raise their now-healthy surviving son , Miles , and daughter Zaire , S. " Hospitals are supposed to be the safest and most sanitary places around . You do n't go into the hospital and get an infection , you go there to get one cleared up .
