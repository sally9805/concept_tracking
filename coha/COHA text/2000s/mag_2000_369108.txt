In the wake of Dick Cheney 's most recent heart attack , everybody ( this columnist included ) was quick to praise both Cheney and his doctors  --  him for checking into the hospital without delay ; them for taking aggressive action once he arrived . Almost lost in the congratulatory spin , however , was the fact that the would-be Vice President is still a sick man . <P> Regardless of how well Cheney fields reporters ' questions or waves to the cameras , he ca n't erase a history of four heart attacks , one quadruple-bypass surgery and a coronary artery propped open with a metal stent  --  all over a 22-year period in a man considered far too young to have suffered so many setbacks . <P> What makes his prognosis even more problematic should he take office is that the life of an active Vice President is hectic and not particularly healthy , with all the fast food and heavy state dinners that lubricate the business of government . <P> We still do n't have all the facts about the state of Cheney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week indicate there is room for improvement . We knew that he waited until his third heart attack to quit smoking . We now know that he has gained 40 lbs . since his 1988 bypass and exercises just twice a week . His doctors can do only so much . If he wants to avoid another emergency trip to the hospital , he is going to have to take responsibility for his health and start making some changes . <P> At the top of the list is exercise . Twice a week is just not good enough . The standard minimum recommendation  --  working out for 30 to 60 minutes three or four times a week  --  is for people who do n't have a history of heart trouble . Gone are the days when doctors advised heart patients to limit their physical activity for fear of adding more stress on the heart . Dozens of studies have shown that heart patients need to work their heart muscles more , not less . Aerobic exercise ( walking , jogging and cycling ) are generally the most beneficial , but weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . <P> An added benefit of stepping up his exercise routine is that it will help him shed his extra pounds . Obesity  --  defined as 30% or more over your healthy body weight  --  can increase the risk of heart disease as much as 15% . To lose his excess baggage , Cheney will have to start burning off more calories than he consumes . Exercise , however , is only half that battle . The other half will take planning and portion control . He may not be able to avoid state dinners , but he can push the creamy sauces and fatty meat to the side of his plate . <P> At first glance , Cheney 's blood pressure ( 106/80 ) and total-cholesterol level ( 174 mg/dL ) seem O.K. , but given his medical history , they are not ideal . Cholesterol levels below 200 are normal for most people . But in a heart patient taking cholesterol-lowering drugs , doctors prefer to see levels from 130 to 150  --  targets best achieved by combining medication with strict diet and exercise . <P> Cheney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart has suffered over the past two decades , but if he cleans up his act , he may help ensure that the heartbeat away from the presidency is a strong one . <P> Dr. Ian is a medical correspondent for NBC 's Today Show .
