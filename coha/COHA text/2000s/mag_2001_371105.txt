The streets of Tokyo are beginning to stink like New York did when I lived there in the 1980s . " That 's just about the worst insult you could deliver in Japan , but Yasunori Fukugawa , 47 , a professor of urban planning , is n't the only one who sniffs trouble . In the shadows of Tokyo 's futuristic skyscrapers , there are tent cities with hundreds of permanently homeless men . Mother Teresa 's nuns have set up a soup kitchen in the second richest nation on Earth . The economy is shrinking , and the official unemployment rate has risen to 5% , highest in a generation . In recent weeks , the blue-chip stars of the country 's manufacturing sector  --  the makers of computer chips , TVs and PCs , such as Toshiba , Fujitsu and NEC  --  have announced that they will shed tens of thousands of jobs . <P> Amid this gloom , the Japanese are placing their hopes on a Prime Minister who comes across like a rock star . Junichiro Koizumi is a 59-year-old career foot soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one brief period , has ruled Japan for the past 46 years . But Koizumi has shrewdly positioned himself as an outsider . " If my party tries to destroy my reforms , if they try to stand in my way , I wo n't hesitate to destroy the party itself , " he said repeatedly while he was campaigning for parliamentary candidates this summer . <P> Koizumi 's program is revolutionary . It amounts to a systematic unraveling of Japan 's political and financial institutions . To help ease the burden of the government 's debt , estimated to be as high as $5.5 trillion by some economists , he has proposed cutting the budget 10% and shifting spending from public-works projects to education , job training and environmental cleanup . Koizumi has set a three-year target for settling the balance sheets of Japan 's heavily indebted banks . He has appointed a free-wheeling Cabinet that is younger , more female and includes more outsiders than any seen before . Most stunning of all , Koizumi has made a promise that he will have no trouble keeping : there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get better . Such straight talk is endearing . " I wish he could be my father , " coos Yoshie Hishinima , 30 . " My own is nowhere near as cool . " <P> Such sentiments are common . Every word Koizumi speaks is golden . Whether celebrating with a champion sumo wrestler , tossing a baseball back and forth with President Bush , or commiserating with leprosy victims mistreated for decades by the government , Koizumi has touched a downcast nation . A record label has released a CD of his favorite Elvis hits . There 's a mint-flavored Koizumi chewing gum . Last week stores started selling a coffee-table book with snapshots of Koizumi in a bathrobe , Koizumi reading , Koizumi playing baseball , Koizumi eating noodles . " The whole country is depressed , " says Masaaki Nagamoto , 45 , a law clerk shopping for Koizumi kitsch one recent afternoon . " All our faith is in Koizumi. "
