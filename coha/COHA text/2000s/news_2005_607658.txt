<p> If members of Congress leading efforts to eradicate performance-enhancing drugs from athletics want to get an idea of just how difficult that will be , they need only turn to the Internet . <p> While the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative investigation continues in San Francisco and Major League Baseball officials argue with the players ' union over what penalties should be handed down to drug offenders , the Web already offers a new generation of steroids designed to avoid current tests . <p> The Washington Post obtained five dietary supplements  --  each of which touted its ability to build muscle fast  --  available online and asked a prominent Los Angeles researcher to test them . Don Catlin , who directs the U.S. Olympic drug testing lab at UCLA , said four of the products contained previously undetected anabolic steroids . One contained a steroid that came to the attention of authorities just two years ago but , until now , was thought to be in only limited circulation . <p> " They are all steroids , " Catlin said in a telephone interview after running tests on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . " They are all going to be effective . " The Post reimbursed Catlin for the cost of testing the substances . <p> It is impossible to gauge the use of these so-called designer steroids . But their discovery shows how professional athletes , including Major League Baseball and National Football League players and Olympic athletes subject to regular , mandatory drug tests , continue to have at their disposal performance-enhancing products that are not detectable . <p> Catlin said the steroids are reminiscent of tetrahydrogestrinone , or THG , and norbolethone , the two steroids connected to BALCO , the Burlingame , Calif. - based nutritional supplements company whose clients included Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants and more than a dozen professional baseball and football players and track and field athletes . But unlike THG , which was sold secretly to elite athletes before Catlin discovered it in 2003 , the five supplements obtained by The Post are widely available  --  and affordable . Their costs ranged from $50 to $125 per bottle . <p> And this might just be the beginning . Two officials with prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anonymity , said it is easy for companies to outwit drug testers . " There 's an unlimited pool of steroids , " one official said . " You could do this for the next 100 years . . . . The longer they do n't pay attention the more rampant it gets . " <p> Despite all the attention being given to steroid use in sports , chemists have apparently been able to manufacture a steady stream of new steroids , often by just slightly altering the chemical properties of known banned drugs or by turning to long-forgotten recipes from steroid cookbooks from the 1950s and 1960s . " It 's pretty obvious what 's going on , " Catlin said . The companies " are making tons of money . If they do n't get caught , they turn on the spigot and turn out more . " <p> " It 's not very difficult for some smart chemist to bypass " the law , said Olivier Rabin , the science director at the World Anti-Doping Agency , which sets drug policy for many international sports . The Montreal-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three of the products obtained by The Post on its 2006 list of banned drugs following an internal review that was not connected to Catlin 's analysis . <p> The supplement company officials said the lenient sentences handed down in the BALCO probe seem to have emboldened U.S. companies to delve into the distribution of newly created designer steroids , moving an industry previously the secret domain of black-market chemists , tight-lipped middlemen and small groups of elite athletes into the mainstream . <p> BALCO founder Victor Conte , who admitted giving steroids and other drugs to athletes , negotiated a plea deal with federal prosecutors this year that included just four months imprisonment . Former NFL linebacker Bill Romanowski admits in a new book that he used Conte 's designer steroids to avoid the league 's drug testing program . " As soon as I found out something could be tested for , I stopped taking it , " the book states , CBS News reported Sunday . <p> In response to the furor over the BALCO revelations , Congress this year held several high-profile hearings in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . Lawmakers introduced four separate bills aimed at imposing federal drug-testing standing standards on professional sports , though none is expected to pass this year . <p> Officials within the dietary supplement industry said increasingly rigorous drug testing in U.S. professional sports and tougher anti-steroid laws  --  the Anabolic Steroid Act of 2004 made 36 steroids illegal , bringing the total to 59 banned in the United States  --  have sent the demand for undetectable steroids skyrocketing . <p> Catlin said that in more than 20 years in Olympic drug testing , he had found only three designer steroids , all between 2002 and 2004 , before this summer , when The Post sent him the five dietary supplements . " THG was the thing that broke it all open , " Catlin said . " It 's a simple step to expect that more people will come into the market because there 's money to be made . " <p> Athletes have for decades sought out anabolic steroids because they help build muscle and endurance . But steroids are also known for undesirable side effects and most professional sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Catlin were : Superdrol , supplied by Designer Supplements of New Hyde Park , N.Y. , for Anabolic Xtreme of San Diego ; Prostanozoland Ergomax LMG , both marketed by Applied Lifescience Research Industries ( ALRI ) of Las Vegas ; Methyl 1-P , sold by Legal Gear of Brighton , Mich. ; and , FiniGenX Magnum Liquid , sold by PharmaGenX of San Marcos , Calif . <p> Representatives from each of the companies declined or did not respond to multiple written and telephone requests for interviews . <p> Kevin Smith , the president of Anabolic Xtreme , said in an e-mail that the company no longer distributes Superdrol . <p> ALRI head Author L. Rea and industry partner Bruce Kneller of Gaspari Nutrition , which has a working relationship with ALRI , wrote in an open letter to The Post on a public Internet message board that " none of the compounds we have developed and currently market are in current violation of any controlled substance act at either the federal or state level . . . . We feel our products are correctly and legally marketed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Known steroids were first banned in the United States in the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 , which was crafted during the furor over steroids that arose after Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for an anabolic steroid at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul after winning a gold medal in the 100 meters . <p> Congress last year banned dozens of dietary supplements in an attempt to curb the distribution of steroid products . That law , which went into effect in January , was aimed primarily at products known as steroid precursors , substances that metabolize into illegal steroids only after they are ingested . The products obtained by The Post are full-blown steroids , Catlin said . <p> " Congress has spoken definitively , absolutely , on any kind of anabolic steroids or precursors , " said Rep. John E. Sweeney ( R-N.Y. ) , who is sponsoring legislation that would make it more difficult to buy banned steroids over the Internet by forcing Internet auction sites to more aggressively police themselves . " This is absolutely contrary to what we 've already been very clear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws in place , and it requires Congress to look harder and close those loopholes . " <p> It is against the law to sell drugs that are improperly labeled or not approved by the Food and Drug Administration . <p> Catlin 's analyses of the five products obtained by The Post suggest that none is properly labeled as a dietary supplement , as defined in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 , which governs the industry and places dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of foods rather than drugs . The FDA declared THG illegal after it was identified by Catlin in 2003 , noting that it was a synthetic anabolic steroid . <p> FDA officials declined interview requests , according to FDA spokeswoman Kimberly Rawlings , but in an e-mailed statement she said the agency has been aggressively combating the distribution of steroids and steroid-like substances in dietary supplements . Rawlings cited regulatory steps taken since 2004 to remove androstenedione  --  which is known as andro and was made famous by former baseball player Mark McGwire in the 1990s  --  from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take appropriate action against any product that purports to be a ' dietary supplement ' if it is determined that product contains steroids , steroid precursors or active ingredients found in prescription drugs , " Rawlings said . <p> One of the steroids Catlin identified had been available on the underground steroid market before it made its way into supplements . In Ergomax LMG , Catlin said he found the steroid madol  --  also known as DMT  --  that attracted headlines after it was seized by Canadian customs in December 2003 from a former Canadian sprinter , who was prosecuted in Canada on drug charges earlier this year . After the athlete was caught with the drug , WADA declared it banned . <p> Bottles of Superdrol and Ergomax LMG obtained by The Post in August did not contain their chemical formulations on their labels , referring to their contents only by trademarked names  --  Methasteron in the case of Superdrol and Pherobolix in the case of Ergomax . Catlin said neither name had any scientific meaning that would aid in identifying it . A bottle of Prostanozol reported its chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said appeared to be an attempt to avoid being " flagged by some nasty government computer . " And two ingredients  --  one a synthetic anabolic steroid , another a progestin , a close relative to a steroid  --  did not match the chemical names reported on a bottle of Methyl 1-P , Catlin said . An advertisement for FiniGenX Magnum on the company Web site gives insight into PharmaGenX 's operating philosophy . <p> " THE MOST POTENT DIETARY SUPPLEMENT EVER DEVELOPED FOR SIZE AND STRENGTH IS STILL LEGAL ! " the advertisement says . " Finigenx Magnum . . . was not on the updated Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 . We had independent chemists search the ' Act ' " from top to bottom for Finigenx Magnum or any ingredients that are in our solution and they came up with ZERO , ZIP , NADA. "
