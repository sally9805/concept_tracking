<p> CONCERT PREVIEW <p> ERIC CLAPTON <p> WITH ROBERT CRAY <p> When : 7:30 p.m . Wednesday <p> Where : United Center , <p> 1901 W. Madison <p> Tickets : $60-$125 <p> Phone : ( 312 ) 559-1212 <p> If you see Derek Trucks during his second trip to Chicago in three weeks , do him a favor and pinch him so he knows he 's not dreaming . Better yet , pinch him to make sure he 's awake . n The world 's hardest-working axman , fresh off the road with the Allman Brothers Band , is already back on tour with Eric Clapton . The third date of their five-week North American swing is set for Wednesday at the United Center . <p> Perhaps even more indicative of his in-demand status is how he spent a recent " week off " : recording with jazz legends McCoy Tyner and Jack DeJohnette ; playing tunes on " The CBS Saturday Early Show " from " Songlines , " the eclectic , critically hailed album by the Derek Trucks Band ; plugging the newly released " Songlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January ; boning up on Clapton 's music for the tour , and squeezing in a little face time with his wife , blues-rock star Susan Tedeschi , and their two young children . <p> Trucks , the 27-year-old slide-guitar prodigy who joined the ABB as a teenager , feels no resentment from any of the Allmans , including his uncle , drummer Butch Trucks , for his conflicting schedule . <p> " They 've been really gracious , " says Trucks , himself the most gracious of interview subjects during a half-hour call last week from his New York hotel room . " I was worried when I told them what was going on . I did n't know how they 'd react , but they were really excited for me . They wanted to help me any way they could . They knew what kind of an opportunity it was for me , especially because they were so familiar with Eric 's music and the whole Derek and the Dominos legacy . " <p> That short-lived blues-rock supergroup , formed in 1970 by Clapton and joined by guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have represented Clapton at his best , due in no small part to the guitar interplay between old Slow Hand and Allman , who died the following year . Clapton 's longtime fans are anxiously anticipating the performance of songs from the album " Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs , " with Trucks filling in the Allman licks . <p> And Clapton , who named his group for the way his name was mispronounced during a stage introduction ( Derek instead of Eric ) , finally has his Derek . <p> Trucks says the group had four or five Derek and the Dominos ' songs in its repertoire during a spring European tour , but he points out that Clapton is on the road not just with Trucks but also with guitarist Doyle Bramhall II , a holdover from previous tours . <p> " It 's really wild , with Eric , who gets such an amazing tone , and me playing in open E without a pick , and Doyle playing left-handed with his upside-down guitar , " Trucks says . " There are things that Doyle can pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quirks in his playing . " <p> Who plays what <p> Trucks realizes he can not establish the kind of musical kinship by spending a few weeks on the road with even the most talented guitarist that he has with Warren Haynes , his partner in the Allman Brothers since 2000 . He says he would love to find that same level of camaraderie with Clapton : " There were a few times during the tour where there were some naturally really magical moments . That 's exciting that the chemistry is there a few months into it . Of course , I 've known Warren since I was 11 , so there 's no substitute for that , but we 're well on our way . " <p> There 's an ever-evolving relationship between the two Allman Brothers guitarists , almost like two chess masters who have played against each other countless times and can anticipate each other 's next several moves . <p> " A lot of it 's that and finding what your strengths are and what his strengths are , " Trucks says . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the places where you 're better or he 's better . It 's easy to be ultra-competitive in a two-guitar band . To me that does n't go anywhere after a certain point . With us , we 're beyond that stage . We have enough mutual respect to know where each other resides . " <p> Many newcomers to the ABB assume that when splitting up the guitar solos on their classic material , Trucks plays all the Duane Allman parts and Haynes takes on Dickey Betts ' role , but Trucks says it 's more complicated than that . <p> " On some level that 's the easy comparison , " he says . " You have to remember , though , that Warren played that Duane role for seven years from 1989 to ' 96 before I was in the band . When he came back into the fold , it was a matter of divvying those solos up . It took a good , solid year to reinvent those roles . We went back to square one . " <p> Keeps good company <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rock legend J.J. Cale in the studio for the " Road to Escondido " sessions . The resulting album will drop Nov. 7 on Warner Bros . <p> " That was my first time meeting Eric , Doyle , keyboardist Billy Preston who died June 6 , drummer Jimmy Oldecker ... it was pretty overwhelming . I was in the studio with multiple living legends , and I was like a kid in a candy store . I 'm looking around , saying to myself , ' There 's Billy Preston , there 's J.J. Cale . ' Every one of them was really generous . You did n't feel like you had no place being there . I was really shocked at how comfortable the whole thing felt . " <p> Trucks says he played on six or eight tracks during two days of sessions for " Escondido , " but is n't sure how much of his work was used . He does allow , " I 've heard some of the finished product , and it 's one of the strongest records in quite a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite being around musicians his entire life , thanks to his uncle Butch , Trucks has the good sense to recognize his privileged position , not just with rock legends like Clapton but also with the blues greats . <p> Asked which ones made the strongest impression on him , Trucks first mentions the late soul-blues artist Little Milton . <p> " With the Allman Brothers , we had some amazing moments with Little Milton at the Beacon Theater the band 's spring headquarters in New York a month before he passed , " he says . " He and Warren were very close , and Gregg Allman , the ABB 's vocalist-keyboardist modeled his singing style after Little Milton . It was interesting to see Gregg around Milton . He showed a whole different side of himself that I 'd never seen before . And it was the same thing with the two Allman Brothers drummers Butch Trucks and Jaimoe when we saw Elvin Jones in New York before he passed . They were sitting on the floor cross-legged like little kids . And me and Susan sat in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . " <p> Still , a lot of guys would be finding every excuse to stay close to home with a wife like Tedeschi , whose career is skyrocketing much like her husband 's . How does Trucks make time for family ? " We 've found creative ways to keep everyone close . My family was there for two weeks of rehearsal with Clapton in France . And they were there in London for our Albert Hall gigs . It 's very expensive , but having family close is at the top of my list . I 'm lucky to have grown up with a close family . My mom travels on the road with Susan and the kids . " <p> Trucks and Tedeschi have a son Charlie , 4 , named for guitarist Charlie Christian , and daughter Sophia , 2 , named for a John Coltrane ballad . <p> jjohnson@suntimes.com <p> IN THE WORKS <p> Anyone wan na book a faces reunion ? <p> The Faces have n't played together in more than 30 years , but vocalist Rod Stewart says he would n't rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 'd be great to put the band together for charity or a one-off event , " he says , adding that the group 's surviving members  --  guitarist Ronnie Wood , keyboardist Ian McLagan and drummer Kenney Jones  --  are open to the idea , too . " Ronnie is always up for it . So 's Ian and Kenney . We 'd just need to find ourselves a bass player , " he said , referring to Ronnie Lane , who died in 1997 due to complications from multiple sclerosis . <p> For now , Stewart is focused on his next album , " Still the Same ... Great Rock Classics of Our Time , " due Oct. 12 . <p> AFTER ' SUN , ' R.E.M . RETURNING TO STUDIO <p> R.E.M . last week released the two-CD compilation " And I Feel Fine , " classic and rare material from its first five years on I.R.S.

" <p> " We 'll start rehearsals probably some time in the next month or two , " Mills says . " I do n't think in terms of directions , but I think this next record might have a little more rock to it .
