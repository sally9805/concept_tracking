If Dave had known , before he 'd picked up the phone , how much trouble this one call would cause , he would 've let it go directly to voice mail . <br> But it was Sunday morning , and he was enjoying  --  very much  --  the experience of surfing the cable TV news channels from the comfort of Sophia 's bed . <br> He loved hanging out in the bedroom of her little apartment , and not <br> just because most of the time he was in here of late , he was in the process <br> of taking off Sophia 's clothes . <br> Though she 'd lived in this tiny second- floor walk- up for far fewer years <br> than he 'd inhabited his spacious and still- spartan condo , she 'd turned this <br> place into a real home . Her furnishings were unique  --  quirky , mismatched <br> pieces she 'd picked up in flea markets and painted in the vibrant <br> colors of the Mediterranean . Rich blues in a variety of shades mingled <br> with bright yellows , warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newness of spring . Artwork  --  some of it her own , and quite good  --  hung on the walls . The open windows were covered by full , gauzy curtains that shimmered and breathed with the breeze . A ceiling fan was kept always running , moving at its lowest , laziest speed . <br> Last week Sophia had moved the TV into the room for him  --  an admitted <br> news junkie  --  and as the phone rang again , he pushed the remote <br> control 's mute button as he shouted to her , in the bathroom , " You want <br> me to get that ? " <br> Sophia had just turned on the water , and as he heard the shower door <br> clunk shut , she called back , " You do n't have to . " <br> Dave should 've ignored it and turned off the TV and gone into the <br> bathroom to help Sophia wash herself in those hard- to- reach places , but <br> he was an idiot . He was still on a high from last night , when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone to find that she 'd called him while <br> he was in the air . Five times . <br> She 'd gotten home several days early from her own business trip to <br> Denver and  --  of course , because he had purposely neglected to tell her of <br> his own international trek  --  was wondering where he was . She was cooking <br> dinner , although , honestly ? After four days apart ? They were going to <br> be eating late . <br> Dave had called her immediately , headed straight to her place , where <br> she 'd jumped him the moment he 'd walked in the door  --  as if she 'd been <br> as starved for his touch as he 'd been for hers . <br> Incredibly , it was n't the fabulous sex they 'd had right there in her living room that had made his day , week , year  --  no , life . It was later , after dinner , with Sophia drowsy , her head on his shoulder , as they were about to fall asleep , telling him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better  --  as in , she did n't have her usual nightmares  --  when she spent the night in his arms . <br> It seemed the perfect segue for him to ask her about those nightmares  --  <br> a topic they 'd both shied away from , for years . And this time , he <br> was ready for it . This time , he knew the questions to ask . <br> But then she 'd added that , in the morning if he wanted her to , she 'd <br> clear out a drawer for him , maybe make him some space in her closet . . . ? <br> If he wanted her to ? <br> Dave had answered by kissing her , and she 'd kissed him back , and <br> they 'd made love again  --  slowly this time . Sweetly . She 'd breathed his <br> name on a sigh and she 'd fallen asleep almost immediately after , leaving <br> him holding her in his arms , with his heart so full his chest actually hurt . <br> But now , in the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the <br> closet space were n't enough for Dave . Nuh- uh . No , sir . He had to further <br> stake his claim here in Sophia 's life by answering the telephone on her <br> bedside table at 10:37 on a sunny Sunday morning , with a voice still rusty <br> and deep from a satisfying night made up only partially of sleep . <br> " Hello ? " <br> There was a hesitation  --  an indrawn breath  --  as if the person on the <br> other end were surprised to hear someone male pick up the phone . That 's <br> right . Uh- huh . He was so the man . He was the dude with the cojones <br> grande who was going to get his very own drawer here in Sophia 's pretty <br> bedroom . <br> " May I speak to Sophia ? " The voice , when it finally came , was female , <br> older , with a hint of Great Britain in its precise enunciation . <br> " I 'm afraid she 's indisposed , " Dave said . " May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask her to call her Aunt Maureen ? " She pronounced <br> it ahhnt , rather than like the insect . " Maureen Miles . I 'm her father 's sister <br> . . . ? " <br> Oh , no . <br> " Yes , " Dave said . " Of course . Hi . Sophia 's , um , told me about you . <br> From Boston , right ? I 'm Dave . Her . . . " What ? Boyfriend ? Lover ? <br> Bedroom- drawer guy ? They 'd talked about a lot of things over the past <br> weeks , but they 'd never precisely defined what their relationship now was . <br> Maureen Miles did n't seem to care . There was more to her message . <br> " Will you let her know that her father 's back in the hospital ? " <br> Shit . " I 'm sorry to hear that , " Dave said . " Mass General again ? " <br> Another brief pause . " Yes . The doctors have given him only a few days <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see his daughter . I should think <br> she owes him at least that much  --  " <br> " I 'm sorry , " Dave cut her off . " With all due respect , ma'am , do we live <br> in the same universe ? Because in the reality- based one where I reside , <br> Sophia owes him nothing . " <br> " He 's her father , " the woman said . <br> " He may have contributed his sperm to the creative process , " Dave <br> said tartly , " but in my opinion he lost the right to call himself Daddy a few <br> decades ago . " <br> She was silent again for a moment , but she was just regrouping . She <br> had n't given up . " Please tell her that he 's being moved into hospice in a <br> few days . " <br> " I 'll give her the message , " Dave said , a but heavy in his tone , and the <br> woman hung up without a thank- you . <br> He dropped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto Sophia 's pillows , staring up at the spinning ceiling fan . <br> From the bathroom , he heard the sound of the water shutting off , the <br> shower door opening . Sophia 's melodic voice . " We need to get moving if <br> we 're going to make it to Encinitas by noon . " <br> What ? Dave lifted his head and aimed his voice toward the bathroom <br> door . " Noon ? Wait a minute , why ? " <br> She appeared in the doorway , gloriously naked , drying herself with a <br> towel , her wet hair slicked back from her face . She was one of those <br> women who were even more beautiful when not wearing makeup . <br> Or clothes . <br> It was hard to think or listen when Sophia was naked , and he 'd obviously <br> not heard her response to his question , because she gave him her I 'm <br> repeating myself because you 're staring at me blankly smile and said , again , <br> " The main parking lot 'll fill up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up , struggling to make sense of her words . " Are we <br> talking about the same thing ? The parking lot 'll fill up ? For a flea market ? " <br> " Antique show , " she corrected him , heading out of sight , back to the <br> sink , where she kept a collection of bottles and jars of lotion , each one of <br> them smelling sweeter than the last . If he hurried , he could watch her <br> smooth some onto her arms and legs , her stomach and breasts . <br> As he skidded to a stop in the bathroom , she met his eyes in the mirror . <br> " You know , we do n't have to go . " <br> " I want to . " He opened the shower door and turned on the water . " The <br> thrill of the hunt , the excitement of finding a treasure hidden in with the <br> trash , the hours tromping through the brain- meltingly hot sun with the four <br> million other people who helped us fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hoping to find the exact same perfect cabinet for the kitchen <br> before we do , so maybe we 'll have to win a duel or probably a spelling bee <br> in order to gain ownership . . . I 'm totally there , T- H- E- R- E. " <br> Sophia had turned around to look at him , her gaze traveling below his <br> waist , her lower lip caught between her teeth as she tried not to smile  --  <br> and failed . " You either really love antiques , or you 're lying through your <br> teeth . " She reached out and wrapped her fingers around him as she gave <br> up and laughed . " I 'm going to go with lying through your teeth . " <br> Dave laughed , too , as she stroked him , as she smiled up into his eyes . <br> " Obviously I 'd anticipated a different morning agenda , " he told her . " But <br> I 'm a grown- up . I can multi- task . I can both be your antique- hunting partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to make you come <br> after we get home . " <br> " Hmm , " she said , swaying closer , the tips of her breasts brushing his <br> chest as she pressed his erection against the softness of her stomach . " Or <br> we can say the heck with the main parking area , and take the PITA shuttle <br> from the south lot . " <br> " South lot , " he repeated , unable to keep himself from touching her , his <br> fingers sliding across her silky , clean , lotion- sweet skin . " There 's a south lot ? " <br> Sophia nodded , then jumped up , wrapping her arms around his neck , <br> her legs around his waist , like a piggyback ride in reverse . <br> " I love the south lot , " Dave told her as he grabbed her to keep her <br> from slipping off him , her perfect derriere filling his hands . And God , this <br> was unlike any other piggyback ride he 'd ever given anyone , because she <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Holy shit . " <br> She pulled back to look at him , laughter lighting her face and making <br> her eyes sparkle and dance . " New one , huh ? " she asked as she began to <br> move against him . <br> He nodded . " Oh , yeah . " His experience with sex , pre- Sophia , was <br> ridiculously limited , and she knew it because , well , he 'd told her the truth . <br> They 'd talked about a lot of things in those first few days A.S .  --  after <br> Sacramento  --  and while he had n't been ready to go into full , gory detail <br> about his farce of a relationship with Kathy- slash- Anise , he had confessed <br> to Sophia that his full sexual oeuvre was limited to five interactions with <br> one woman who did n't particularly like him , even though she 'd pretended <br> otherwise . <br> Sophia had n't fainted at that news , no doubt because her own baggage <br> was also quite cumbersome when it came to sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's arms , they 'd made <br> a promise to be honest in regard to their intimacy  --  since it was a potential <br> minefield for both of them . <br> So , yes . Having sex standing up in the middle of the bathroom was a <br> new one for him . Although there really was n't much he could do but stand <br> there holding her , the muscles in his arms and shoulders getting quite the <br> workout . <br> Which maybe meant he was a wimp , because she was petite and <br> did n't weigh more than a hundred pounds . But Dave was discovering that <br> holding on to a hundred- pound woman was a very different experience <br> than holding on to a hundred- pound woman while having sex with her . <br> " Ah , God , " he said . " Soph . . . " <br> " Thumbs up or down ? " <br> " Oh , up , " he told her . " Big up . " <br> " Me too , " she gasped , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> to , you know , set me on the counter , by the sink , if you need to  --  " <br> " Not a chance . " Dave loved where his hands were , loved the sensation <br> of her legs and buttocks straining to push him more fully inside of her , but <br> when he shifted slightly to get a better grip , he discovered  --  eureka !  --  <br> there was something he could do besides simply stand there and not drop <br> her . He shifted again to hold most of her weight with his left arm , freeing <br> up his right hand to touch her again , with slightly better aim . <br> She sighed his name , and that , combined with the increased speed of <br> her rocking motion , was enough to bring him teetering to the edge of his <br> release , so he touched her harder , deeper , and she came with a moan and <br> a shudder that he loved as much as he loved his new drawer and closet <br> space . And in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time between <br> his knowing that he , too , was going to orgasm  --  now  --  and the deep <br> rush of mind- blowing pleasure that was already starting to surge through <br> his body , he remembered the phone call . <br> He 'd yet to tell Sophia that her father was in the hospital . <br> Dave came with a crash , with a shout  --  " God , I love you ! "  --  pulling <br> her warm , pliant body more tightly against his , as she kept coming around <br> him , urging him , as always , to give her more , more . <br> It should have diminished his pleasure  --  his remembering the unhappy <br> message he 'd promised to deliver . It should have made him <br> ashamed for forgetting something so important in the first place . <br> It should have , but it did n't . <br> Sophia 's father was a rat- bastard and few besides his sister Maureen <br> would miss him when he was gone . <br> " Sweet Jesus , " Dave said when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , still clinging to him , nuzzling his neck , ankles <br> locked just beneath his butt . <br> Arms shaking , knees wobbly , he carried her out of the bathroom and <br> dumped her onto the bed , collapsing beside her . " That was a solid thirty <br> on the fun scale . " <br> She laughed again . " When is it ever not a thirty ? " <br> In an effort to lighten things up  --  mostly for his own sake , since the <br> simple fact that he was in a relationship with the woman of his dreams was <br> often enough to get him choked up  --  Dave had suggested a rating system , <br> one to ten , for each new- to- him sexual position , of which there were many . <br> And yes , in all honesty , it was a way , too , for him to acknowledge his lack <br> of experience  --  by addressing it straight on , with humor . <br> " Sweetheart "  --  he opened his eyes to do his best Bogart  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you is a twenty . " <br> She had her head propped up on one elbow so that she could look <br> down at him , her eyes wide and serious as her smile slowly faded . <br> " You know that I love you , too , right ? " she finally murmured . <br> He gazed back at her for several long moments before he responded . <br> He waited until he knew for sure that his voice would n't vibrate with emotion . <br> " You do n't have to say that . " <br> " It 's true , " Sophia insisted . " These past few months have been . . . " <br> She shook her head . " Sad , because of Nash dying , but . . . Also . . . I do n't <br> know if I 've . . . " She looked down toward the jumble of bright blue sheets <br> beneath them and started again . " I ca n't remember ever being this . . . " <br> She searched for the right word as Dave waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gaze again , her eyes guileless and nearly as blue as the sheets . <br> " Content . " <br> Not quite the word he was hoping for . Still , he smiled because he was <br> okay with it . Fact was , he 'd be okay with a wide variety of less than words . <br> Such as satisfied . Comfortable . At ease . <br> At peace . <br> Dave knew he was Sophia 's second choice . He 'd accepted that weeks <br> ago , the very first night they 'd made love . It would be enough . It was <br> enough . <br> " I 'm glad , " he told her now , reaching up to push her hair back behind <br> her ear , and it was n't a lie . He let her look long and hard into his eyes so <br> she would know that he meant it , that he accepted her words for what they <br> were  --  something good , if not fairy- tale perfect . <br> Her mouth quirked up into a smile . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " <br> " What ? " Dave laughed as he realized what she 'd said , and then rolled <br> his eyes . " Yeah , actually , " he said , " I 'm pretty sure I do . I fall somewhere <br> between pickled and poached . Maybe , right after I get a haircut , for about <br> two minutes , I can pass for steamed and . . . As fascinating as this discussion <br> is , can we save it for tonight ? Because  --  and I should have told you <br> this before , but you stupefied me with your nakedness . . . . " <br> " I 'm still naked , " she pointed out , that lip again between her teeth as she played with the hair on his chest , and dear God , Dave could see a whole lot of as long as we 're going to park in the south lot dot dot dot in her eyes . " Right , " he said , as his body stirred at the thought of staying in bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , " so I better talk fast . That was your Aunt Maureen on the phone , Soph . Your father 's back in the hospital . " <br> Continues ...
