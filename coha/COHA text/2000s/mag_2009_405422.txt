The Bachelorette ABC , Mondays , 8 p.m . ET/PT 3 stars JILLIAN 'S BACK ! REALITY Jillian Harris gave herself one of the worst opening lines in the history of dating when , at the start of last season 's Bachelor , she asked Jason Mesnick about his preferred hot-dog toppings . Yet she lasted into the final three , by which point she 'd established herself as one of the most endearing characters to come out of reality TV . Now , deservedly , she gets her own show . Cute but not gorgeous , talking in a rabbity rush as she delivers classic Bachelorette sentiments ( " I am 100 percent ready to find love again ! " ) , Jillian seems guileless , adventuresome , even a little sad . One thinks of Sandra Bullock movies or the sidekicks in Jane Austen stories , the nice girls who end up contentedly wed to farmers . This time , though , the male universe revolves around Jillian , and you may wonder if she is n't too good for the bunch . In the premiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sassy little minx ? " Another , a foot fetishist , maneuvered her into removing her shoes . Maybe , dear Jillian , it 's the men who are the hot dogs . Maneater Lifetime , May 30 , 9 p.m .

Cake Boss TLC , May 25 , 10 p.m . ET/PT 3 stars NEW SERIES ! REALITY Buddy Valastro , who runs his family 's Italian bakery in Hoboken , N.J. , whips up vast , elaborate cakes that require visual inspiration , infrastructural forethought and lots of molding chocolate .

They are America 's most highly decorated military veterans . They embody everything great about our country . So I work on the board of the congressional Medal of Honor Foundation to raise money and awareness .
