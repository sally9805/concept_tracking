When it comes to the holidays , I 'm like the little old lady in the well-worn joke . She goes to a restaurant , finishes her meal , then presents the waiter with two complaints : one , the food was awful , and , two , there was n't enough of it . <P> Call me a purist , but as Christmas approaches , it 's worth noting that the ancient and traditional idea of a holiday did not include attempted murders over PlayStation 3 or CNN advisories on how to beat " holiday stress . " According to anthropologists , human festivities  --  probably going back to the Paleolithic era  --  featured the universal ingredients of feasting , dancing , costuming , masking and/ or face painting , for days at a time . These things did n't happen indoors , within the family circle , but around bonfires , in the streets or on the " dancing grounds " of prehistoric civilizations . Holidays bonded whole communities together , not just families . <P> Few , if any , cultures have ignored the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explorers fanned out across the globe , they found colorful and ecstatic festivities everywhere  --  among the hunter-gatherers of Australia and the North American plains , the horticulturists of Polynesia , the village peoples of India . Recently discovered cave art from England shows what the archaeologists call " conga lines " of female dancers from at least 10,000 years ago . <P> From a modern , workaholic perspective , our partying ancestors were wasting precious time . Even supposedly nonjudgmental anthropologists can get a little antsy when they contemplate the caloric expenditure that went into assembling costumes , cooking up treats , crafting musical instruments and rehearsing dance steps , not to mention the festivity itself . In 15th century France , 1 out of 4 days of the year were given over to festivities , usually honoring saints ' days , while the English had , in addition , their " church ales , " wakes and fairs . Work was something you did when you had to . Holidays were what you lived for . <P> Most of these traditional festivities were religious , as Christmas still faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fuzzy one , since in so many religions  --  from ancient Dionysian worship to modern-day Brazilian Candomble and storefront Pentecostalism  --  the best way to contact the deity or deities is to get up and dance and sing and shout . The climax of the ritual celebration was not a drunken stupor but ecstatic union with the gods . <P> So why are we left with such wan and infrequent holidays today ? The answer , simply put , is that in one historical setting after another , traditional celebrations were deliberately suppressed . The ancient Roman lite slaughtered worshippers of Dionysus with as much zeal as when , in later years , they went after Christians . Reformation Protestants criminalized carnival . Wahhabist Muslims , the ideological antecedents of al-Qaeda , battled ecstatic Sufism.
