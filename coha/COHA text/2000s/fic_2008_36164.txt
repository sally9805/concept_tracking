When my fare hauled himself out of the cab near Uphams Corner , I took it as a sign , but face it , even if the fat man 's destination had been fifty miles from my goal , I 'd have found another convenient omen . I 'd made the decision late last night . I needed to have it out with Mooney . <p> The rump end of a minor hangover beat a tattoo in my left temple , and I knew that if I did n't take action , I 'd stay home to night , sprawled on the sofa like a deadbeat , watching old movie reruns , pouring too many Rolling Rocks down my throat . Again . Since it 's my considered opinion that it 's better to do anything than nothing , I was determined to find out why Mooney was n't answering his phone , why he had n't replied to my increasingly urgent messages . Mooney 's a guy you can count on , reliable as taxes , so his unresponsiveness was alarming . <p> I buttoned my sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heater . It gave a gasp and a shudder . Tepid air trickled out near my icy feet . <p> I did n't want to track Moon down at Headquarters . I had mixed feelings about my former place of employment , plus there was the parking . Fact : Parking at the new Crosstown site is laughable , nonexistent and maddening , the subject of lawsuits by irritated officers . Nor did I relish the thought of hanging out at Moon 's apartment building , spooking his neighbors . So I took advantage of my drop-off point to head farther south , swerving over the Neponset River Bridge to Quincy Shore Drive . Stopped at a traffic light , I squinted into the rearview mirror , ran a hand through my disheveled hair , then cupped it over my mouth and smelled my breath . I had n't had a drink in hours , but it seemed like the smell of beer was seeping from my pores . <p> I popped the center armrest console , hoping for breath mints , and found nothing but crumpled gas receipts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of one of Gloria 's crummy Fords , breath mints would have nested sweetly among the tapes , CDs , tampons , and apple cores , but my vintage red Toyota was dead at the bottom of a New Hampshire ravine and I still had n't purchased a replacement . I 'd planned to do it , made a list of possibilities , but a mad dash out of the country had put it and everything else in my life on hold . <p> Gloria 's voice chimed over the two-way , asking any available cab to do a pickup in Maverick Square . I switched her off with barely a flicker of guilt . East Squantum Street changed its name to Dorchester Street without so much as a by-your-leave , and then the Long Island Causeway stretched its skinny neck out to Moon Island , home of the Boston Police Department Firing Range . <p> When I drive , I listen to music . Maybe it was because the cab did n't have a working radio that my thoughts strayed , replaying the conversation I 'd had last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Gianelli , phoning from who knows where . When I 'd asked his location , I got silence , meaningful silence , a warning silence I resented . <p> " You think I would n't know if my line was tapped ? " I 'd said . <p> I 'd heard him sigh , but he had n't answered . And yes , it had been a stupid thing to say . Maybe they 've got some new gizmo I ca n't test for ; maybe they 're one step ahead . So I did n't press for his location , but I 'd tried to press on other things , like when he was coming back to the States , like what I could do to unravel the mess that was keeping him out of the country . <p> That had gotten a response , a quick one . <p> " Nothing , Carlotta . That 's exactly why I called . I mean , I called to see how you 're doing , how Paolina 's doing , too , but I want it clear . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hell with that , I 'd thought ; I was involved . <p> " So what are you saying , Sam ? Good-bye ? Are we going to limit the relationship to phone sex from now on ? " <p> " Do n't do anything . " <p> " But , Sam  --  " <p> " I 'll call again . " <p> A click . A hang-up . A dead end . So I 'd drunk my beers and decided that nothing was harder than doing nothing . Remembering , I steered one-handed through heavy traffic , brooding and yanking at a strand of hair . Wherever Sam was , I decided , it was probably warmer than Boston . Most likely piles of snow had n't turned brown and muddy , with a top layer of dingy gray . I was only planning to ask Mooney a few questions , and asking was n't doing . If Sam inquired , I could still say I 'd done nothing , respected his wishes , foolish as they were . <p> Mooney was my old boss at the BPD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years before I turned in the badge and went private . I was the restless one , the woman in a hurry , the one who needed change to survive . He was the creature of habit and I was counting on that habit now : The last Thursday of the month , first thing in the morning , Mooney shot at the Moon Island range . <p> In the 1700s , Boston 's Harbor Islands served as military outposts to protect the then-bustling seaport . Today , most of them form a chain of national parks . Some , like Bumpkin , Hangman , Snake , Nixes Mate , and Worlds End , in addition to the more mundanely named Thompson and Spectacle , are open to the public . Moon Island , a bump connecting Long Island to the mainland , is more a peninsula than an island , thanks to the causeway . There 's a firefighter training facility at the eastern end , right before the Long Island Bridge , and a nineteenth-century wastewater treatment plant . The firing range is tucked in between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , I opened the cab door and sniffed an unexpectedly salty breeze . Living in Cambridge , the way I do , you can almost forget the proximity of the Atlantic . I inhaled the sea air gratefully . There 's something cleansing about the ocean , all that green water licking the shore , endless and timeless , soothing and hypnotizing . It would be here forever . It did n't care . <p> I sucked in a deep breath , trying to summon some of the Atlantic 's cool indifference for my upcoming encounter , attempting to submerge my feelings , keep them hidden like the secret reefs and rocks beneath the surface of the sea . I suspected that my ex-boss had gotten every single one of my messages , that he 'd decided to ignore them because he did n't want to part with information . I needed to make him understand that he needed to answer my questions . I needed to stay calm in spite of emotion that roiled like the great white waves breaking near the shore . <p> I slammed the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberated . My parka , too heavy to drive in , was stowed in the trunk . I pulled it on and zipped it shut against the wind . <p> Since I was no longer a member of the force , I technically had no right to pass through the small white bungalow and visit the range . I did n't think anyone would bother to stop me since members of the general public , while not welcome to shoot at will , are required to make the occasional appearance . The Moon Island range is where citizens go to get their gun licenses renewed . I could always lie and give that as my purpose , but I did n't think I 'd need deception . A smile , a wave , a confident walk , they fool even cops . <p> My luck was in ; I did n't need a cover story because I knew the guy on the desk . <p> " Mooney , " I said , coming in the front door , continuing out the rear . <p> He was in the third lane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartridges flying from his Glock . He did n't notice me and that was fine . <p> For half a second I was sorry I had n't brought my Smith . I like to shoot ; I like the smell of the range . I 'm not crazy about target shooting ; I do n't get off on it the way some of the guys used to  --  I am the best and all that competitive malarkey . I 'm good . I 've got a good eye for spotting a volleyball on a court , a good eye for a target , but I know target is just a sport , like volleyball . It 's not street . <p> I watched Mooney out of the corner of one eye . I took his wardrobe for granted , the navy pants and light blue shirt that might as well be a uniform . I knew his routine : 120 rounds , three times the limit carried on the street , fourteen in the gun and two thirteen-round clips . Moon 's not a street cop anymore , but he talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the ranks than up . Lots of guys say that , talk about the good old days , but I believe Mooney . He 's good at working the streets , better at streets than bureaucracy , and he excels at bureaucracy . When the suits bring pressure to bear , he tells the uncomfortable truth , ready to step down to the detective bureau or walk a beat and wear the uniform again . So far he 's kept his position as head of Homicide , but he walks a fine line . I thought I saw him notice me , and I wondered what my presence would do for his numbers . <p> " Hey , I figured that was you . " <p> The instructor approached ; what was his name ? Harry , right , Harry something . A nice broad-beamed guy who 'd lost his partner in a shootout and decided to teach other cops how and , more important , when to use their weapons . I smiled and nodded . What are you supposed to say when someone says , " I figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got , " he said with a face-splitting grin , displaying a gun case big enough to house a major hunk of artillery . " H-K MK23 . Special Ops gun . Wan na give it a try ? " <p> I gave a less-than-enthusiastic shrug . <p> " Well , okay , then . Forget it . Navy SEAL buddy of mine dropped it off . Guys say it 's got too much kick for a woman . " <p> " Stop prodding , Harry . " His smile got even broader when I said his name . <p> " You 're just waiting , right ? " <p> " Right . " <p> " You need to reup for anything ? " <p> " No . " I do n't have to keep my numbers up the way Mooney does . <p> " Got more women now . Had to put in another bathroom . " <p> When I used to go to the range , the toilet was for the guys , and the women made do . That 's the way it was when I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , except everybody talks about how times have changed . <p> Harry removed the pistol from the case . " Pretty thing , is n't it ? A lot of the SEALs want something smaller and lighter , but this is a stopper for sure . Forty-five ACPs and those 'll sure drop a target faster than a nine . Double action . You can use the JHP bullets , too , the expandables . " <p> I have about as much patience for gun talk as I do for wine talk . I like to shoot and I like to drink , but I do n't practice either vocabulary . <p> " Pretty heavy , though . " <p> He handed it to me , and I thought why the hell not ? Mooney would n't duck out on me , now that he 'd seen me . Harry handed over ear protectors and goggles . <p> Just like threading a needle , a cop friend named Jo Triola once told me , and we 'd joyfully shared the secret giggles of the girly metaphor . You could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun was like threading a needle . If it was n't a sports meta phor , Jo and I had learned early on , better not say it at all . The concentration required to shoot well , to fire efficiently and effectively , shuts out the rest of the world . If I could continually manufacture tasks that required the same level of concentration as shooting , I would n't have to question Mooney , would n't need to talk to anyone , would n't have to face up to ... <p> I got lost in the sound and the smell and the immediacy of the task at hand , and suddenly it was as clear as if it were happening all over again . Muscle memory can do that to you , I suppose , because the last time I 'd fired a gun , not this gun , but a similarly heavy gun , an unfamiliar gun , and smelled the pungent tang of cordite , I 'd heard the reports unfiltered by earmuffs . I 'd been in South America , in Colombia , in Cartagena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly lanes and motionless paper targets . It had to do with revenge and hatred , with ensuring that my little sister walked out of the room alive . <p> The sweat trickled down my back in spite of the cold and I could have shot forever , slapping magazine after magazine into the well , imagining the people I 'd have liked to kill , trying not to imagine those I wished I could bring back from the dead . As fast as I could pump bullets into the target was n't fast enough . I rammed another magazine home and repositioned my body and I was n't standing in the lane at Moon Island anymore . I was in an airless second-floor room with thick whitewashed walls , smelling sweet florals and spring rain and cordite . <p> " Hey , what the hell ? You okay ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Keep it pointed downrange , " Harry was yelling in my ear . " He 's dead . You fucking shredded him . " <p> " Sorry . " <p> " What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that 's what it comes down to . You 're forced to go back to the daily routine , the **27;1128;TOOLONG stuff , the get-up-in-the-morning stuff . The **45;1157;TOOLONG stuff . <p> Mooney was suddenly there , the way he is , solid and as unassuming as a man the size of a linebacker can be , his face concerned but wary . I caught a glint of gray in the brown hair near his right temple . <p> " I 'll take care of this , Harry , " he said . <p> The instructor glanced at him and then at me , turned and walked away , carrying the H-K and shaking his head . <p> " Carlotta . " <p> " You meant to call me back , right ? " <p> " If I 'm gon na avoid you , I guess I 'll need to change a few habits . " <p> " I can find you anytime . " <p> " You found me now . " <p> " You know what I want . " <p> " Forget about it , Carlotta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " <p> " It 's a secret indictment . Secret . They 're called that for a reason . " <p> " No warrant ? " <p> " Not yet . " <p> " Why ? Why is the DA keeping it under wraps ? Is it political ? " <p> He shrugged . <p> " Mooney , it 's murder . " <p> " That 's right . " <p> " Which murder ? Whose ? Who the hell died ? You can at least tell me that . " <p> " Look , I ca n't talk to you . I ca n't be seen with you . " <p> " You ca n't be seen with me ? Why ? " <p> He lowered his voice . " You know a fed named Dailey ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Gianelli know him ? " <p> " How would I know ? " <p> " You have n't told anybody that I gave Gianelli the heads-up ? " <p> " I would never do that . " <p> " Has anybody been following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gray or brown ? You know the deal . " <p> " No . What the  --  ? " <p> " Just answer the question . " <p> " I should answer your questions , but you wo n't answer mine ? Look , Moon , if I do n't even know what crime he 's supposed to have committed , I ca n't do anything . I ca n't help  --  " <p> " Ask Gianelli . " <p> " Sam does n't want my help . " <p> " Right , Carlotta . He does n't want your help . You ever wonder why ? " <p> " What 's that supposed to mean ? " <p> He licked his lower lip and for a moment I thought he was going to turn away without another word . He stared at the ground as he spoke , kept his voice even and uninflected . " I do n't know , but it occurs to me that maybe Gianelli does n't want you to find out what really happened . He may not want your help because there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do it , but what I do n't understand is why the hell you believe him . You know who he is , right ? What he is ? You know where he comes from . A man lives with that kind of shit since he 's a boy  --  You tell me : How do you live with shit all around you and not get dirty ? " <p> I stared at him , all the rational and convincing words I 'd meant to use forgotten . I could hear the waves against the rocks and the pom-pom-pom of a silenced.22 . <p> " Look , I have to go , " he said quickly . " I ca n't tell you anything . I never could . " <p> " Mooney , I  --  " <p> " Do n't ask me again . You know what I 'm talking about , Carlotta . Is n't it time to admit it to yourself ? " <p> I did n't say anything . I pressed my lips together and stared at the gravel until the individual stones melted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how 's Paolina ? Jeez , I 'm sorry , Carlotta , I should have asked right off . I should have called you back , just to ask . " <p> " Yeah , " I said , swallowing an unexpected lump in my throat . " You should have .
