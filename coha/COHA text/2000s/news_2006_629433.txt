<p> WASHINGTON - When a top Justice Department official outlined the public corruption allegations against lobbyist Jack Abramoff , she almost seemed to be describing his cozy relationship with Rep. Tom DeLay . <p> Abramoff provided public officials with overseas trips , campaign contributions and excessive meals " with the intent ... that the public official would act to benefit Abramoff or his clients , " Alice Fisher , head of the department 's criminal division , said last week . <p> Partly to clear his name in the Abramoff affair , DeLay gave up on Saturday his quest to be reinstated as House majority leader . But federal prosecutors ' outline of the scandal does not fit DeLay in one crucial respect : <p> So far , there is no known conclusive evidence that DeLay , the Republican from Sugar Land , performed political favors for Abramoff in return . <p> Establishing a quid pro quo is necessary to prove political bribery . <p> To make a case against DeLay , who is among the lawmakers said to be under investigation now that the lobbyist is cooperating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated relationship with Abramoff , which grew on trips to Pacific islands , Russia and a golf course in Scotland . <p> The men were introduced in 1994 by conservative Rabbi Daniel Lapin , co-chair of the American Alliance of Jews and Christians , which he created with former GOP presidential candidate Gary Bauer . <p> DeLay , with strong ties to the Christian right , and Abramoff , an Orthodox Jew , apparently hit it off . Within a few years , DeLay would refer to Abramoff as one of his closest friends . <p> As a prominent lobbyist in Washington , Abramoff had much to gain from ties to lawmakers such as DeLay . Likewise , as prosecutors , records and news accounts show , Abramoff had lots to offer , including a nearly endless stream of money provided by his clients . <p> In the mid-1990s , Abramoff persuaded Russian oil and gas clients to donate $1 million to a conservative advocacy group called the U.S. Family Network , which was set up by former DeLay chief of staff Edwin Buckham and collected $2.5 million in its five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Buckham told the former head of the U.S. Family Network - the organization had a single full-time employee - that the Russians gave the money to influence DeLay 's vote on international aid to Russia . DeLay has denied that his vote was influenced improperly . <p> The U.S. Family Network received a half-million dollars from garment manufacturers in the Northern Mariana Islands with ties to Abramoff and a quarter-million dollars from Indian tribes he represented . <p> The money was used to buy radio ads attacking Democrats and to purchase a town house on Capitol Hill near DeLay 's office that , according to the Post , DeLay associates called the " safe house . " DeLay used it for his own campaign fundraising , the newspaper reported . <p> Trip to Russia <p> DeLay 's wife , Christine , worked for three years for a lobbying firm run by Buckham , receiving a monthly salary of $3,200 , a total of $115,200 . <p> The firm , the Alexander Strategy Group , received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees from the U.S. Family Network , money almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of favorite charities of members of Congress , according to DeLay 's attorney . <p> DeLay maintained contacts with Russian executives connected to the energy firm NaftaSib , who were paying Abramoff huge sums to promote their interests in Washington . <p> In August 1997 , DeLay took a trip to Russia that , according to his financial disclosure statements , was underwritten by the National Center for Public Policy Research . Abramoff was an officer on the center 's board , and during the trip DeLay met with the Russians who were paying large fees to Abramoff . <p> Although the president of the policy center said the group funded the trip , she conceded that an international law firm working to promote the interests of Abramoff 's Russian clients covered its costs with a payment of about $165,000 . <p> The Russian businessmen were eager to assure that their country 's economy was supported by International Monetary Fund loans made from funds contributed by the United States . In 1998 , DeLay voted for a foreign aid bill that included funds to replenish the IMF . DeLay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was best for his constituents . <p> Toasting Abramoff <p> Four months after the Russian trip , DeLay , accompanied by his wife and three aides , visited Saipan , in the Northern Marianas . There DeLay made the widely quoted toast to Abramoff as " one of my closest and dearest friends . " The visit was funded by the U.S. territory 's government and a trade group representing clothing manufacturers . <p> The Marianas government had paid Abramoff millions of dollars to lobby Congress in a successful fight to preserve the islands ' exemption from U.S. minimum-wage and immigration laws while still being able to claim that clothes produced there were " made in the U.S.A. " <p> DeLay sided with the Marianas government 's position - a vote that a spokesman said was consistent with his long-held views on trade . <p> About two years later , DeLay and Abramoff went to the British Isles . The travel party included DeLay 's wife , his chief of staff Susan Hirschmann and her husband , and DeLay aide Tony Rudy . <p> The weeklong tour included a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was largely recreational , with a four-day golfing trip to Scotland , where DeLay played at the famed St. Andrews course . <p> The trip also provided Abramoff 's Russian client , NaftaSib general manager Alex Koulakovsky , a chance to spend time with DeLay . <p> The lavish tour cost about $70,000 for the officials , according to House documents . Among the expenses : a suite at the Four Seasons in London for the DeLays ( total cost $4,285 ) , along with thousands of dollars ' worth of meals and golf fees . <p> Again , the National Center for Public Policy Research picked up the tab . Indian tribes who were Abramoff clients because of their interest in gambling legislation donated $50,000 to the NCPPR on the day the trip commenced . <p> Investigators are looking into whether that was a veiled effort to influence DeLay on Indian gaming bills . DeLay has said he thought the trip was an appropriate fact-finding mission funded by a legal nonprofit group . <p> Looking at staff members <p> A DeLay-Abramoff tie that has investigators ' attention involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rudy is reportedly working with federal investigators probing Abramoff 's web of corruption . <p> In court documents , Rudy is described as " Staffer A , " who helped Abramoff stop legislation on Internet gambling and postal rate increases that would have hurt Abramoff clients . Rudy at the time was working on DeLay 's staff . <p> In return , Abramoff funneled $50,000 to Rudy 's wife , court documents said . The money was " obtained from Abramoff 's clients who would and did benefit from Staffer A 's official actions , " prosecutors said . Rudy left Congress in 2000 to work directly for Abramoff . <p> DeLay attorney Richard Cullen denies wrongdoing by the Sugar Land Republican and said the lawmaker had no knowledge of Rudy 's activities on behalf of Abramoff 's clients . <p> Bill Mateja , a former senior Justice Department lawyer involved in corporate fraud cases in Washington and now in private practice in Dallas , said staffers such as Rudy would be of keen interest to prosecutors . <p> Pleading guilty <p> " They are the one who makes things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ordered by members of Congress to kill these bills , " Mateja said . " You would certainly think the member would know . It would be unusual for a staff member to work to kill a bill without the member ordering that . " <p> Abramoff 's lobbying for Indian tribes led to his convictions on the fraud and conspiracy charges . Michael Scanlon , a former DeLay spokesman and later an Abramoff business partner , also has pleaded guilty to fraud charges connected to the bilking of the tribes . <p> The two men played a con game on the tribes , with Abramoff claiming to work for free while steering them to Scanlon for public relations work . The men then secretly split fees of at least $80 million . <p> Investigators are looking into why four Indian tribes were willing to pay so much to Abramoff and Scanlon to win gambling rights . In testimony before congressional committees and e-mail released by Congress , Abramoff said he told the tribes they were buying the influence of important congressional leaders , including DeLay . <p> Contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe , testified that he had told federal investigators that Abramoff instructed him to make large contributions to a charity controlled by Abramoff as a way to " impress Tom DeLay . " <p> To buttress his ties to DeLay , Abramoff frequently contributed to the former majority leader 's projects , giving about $60,000 to political committees controlled by DeLay since 2000 . Abramoff clients also donated a total of $22,500 to a DeLay foundation set up to help abused children . <p> Some donations went to Texans for a Republican Majority , the political action committee whose spending on Texas legislative races led to indictments against DeLay . He was forced to step aside as majority leader when a grand jury lodged the charges in September . <p> Was money buying favors ? <p> Now prosecutors in Washington have to determine whether the donations by Abramoff and his clients were part of a con job by Abramoff to secure big fees or whether the lobbyist used the money in an effort to buy favors . <p> " To charge a public official requires a certain level of intent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribed , said Noel Hillman , head of the Justice Department 's public corruption section . Hillman described an official 's " mental state " as being crucial to the decision by prosecutors to bring criminal charges . <p> Cullen said DeLay has made a formal offer to cooperate with investigators . So far , they have not approached DeLay for any records or asked him any questions , Cullen said . That is in contrast with Rep. Bob Ney , R-Ohio , who has been described in court proceedings in a way that makes it clear he is a target of the investigation . <p> For prosecutors in the bewilderingly complex investigation , one of the legal hurdles is proving a crime occurred in the time frame when it can be prosecuted . A statute of limitations of five years for most white-collar fraud offenses limits liability to actions after early 2001 . The only exception would be if prosecutors can show an ongoing conspiracy . <p> ... <p> THE ABRAMOFF CONNECTION <p> A graphic mapping the former lobbyist 's connections to DeLay and other figures .

This is the nation 's first united government since November 2006 , when an opposition walkout triggered an 18month political crisis , including six months during which Parliament-unable to pass legislation for more than a year-could n't agree on a president . Women have been hit hard by this crisis , the expansion of their rights put on hold . But the women 's movement , eager to make gender equality a priority for this new Cabinet , has already mobilized-emailing supporters , drafting letters to ministers and organizing a sit-in before Parliament-to raise awareness , especially regarding equal nationality rights . Women in Lebanon have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 , when Lebanon won independence from France . Lina Abou-Habib says that since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and subsequent political instability , " It 's as if they 've the government been given a legitimate excuse to go into a coma . " Abou-Habib is executive director of Collective for Research and Training on Development Action ( CRTD-A ) , which runs the Middle East regional campaign " My Nationality : A Right For Me and My Family . " CRTD-A also tries to change family-status laws ( each of Lebanon 's officially recognized 17 religious sects legislates its own personal and family codes ) and works toward rural women 's economic empowerment . Many Lebanese accused Syria of involvement in Hariri 's assassination , which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denies , but mass anti-Syrian rallies led Assad to withdraw troops from Lebanon in 2005 for the first time in 29 years . This was the last foreign military presence to depart , and feminists believed the newfound sovereignty would mean that women 's political time had come . But plans halted when Hezbollah captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 days of fighting ensued , decimating Lebanon 's infrastructure . After , five Cabinet members aligned with the opposition resigned , paralyzing the government , reigniting fears of civil war . " The Lebanese situation has never been easy for women . The issues should remain on the agenda , " notes Abou-Habib , adding that during the crisis , CRTD-A refused to be silent . Now she is optimistic , since the new interior minister , human-rights lawyer Zyiad Baroud , is a " staunch supporter of the nationality campaign . " Ironically Lebanon once had a big women 's movement . Author Zaynab Fawwaz al-Amili ( 1860-1914 ) , who published a who 's who of 455 women famous in their societies , was one of the first Arab-Muslim women to question the veil and protest polygamy . Women won suffrage in 1953 , earlier than in most Arab countries . There were 25 feminist journals published during the 1920s . Women still walk through Beirut in tank tops as well as black head scarves . But such liberties are deceiving . " Women 's rights are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by newly elected Michel Sleiman in May did not mention anything at all about women 's issues , " notes Dr. Dima Dabbous-Sensenig , director at the Institute for Women 's Studies in the Arab World , established at the Lebanese American University hi 1973 . Lebanese feminism " is nothing compared to what it was . Lebanon was the leader ; everything is now on hold , " adds professor Anita Nassar , the institute 's assistant director . A rise in fundamentalist Islam has made it harder for feminist groups , who face conservative opposition that labels activists " importers of Western ideas . " Since the nationality campaign began , regimes many Lebanese regard as more oppressive , such as Algeria , Egypt and Morocco , have reformed their nationality laws . Excuses against reforming Lebanese law indicate a fear of altered demographics in a nation formed on a precarious balance between Muslims and Christians , plus a concern that resettling Palestinian refugees wed to Lebanese women would deny them right of return should Palestinians and Israelis reach a deal . This fear does n't extend to Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Violence against women is another issue ignored during political strife . Rasha Moumneh , co-coordinator of a campaign by the group KAFA ( Enough Violence and Exploitation ) , was quoted in The Daily Star newspaper saying , " There is no current legislation to protect women from domestic violence , and therefore this form of abuse becomes normalized and women find themselves banging their heads against a legal brick wall . " Lebanon signed the U.N . ' s Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ( CEDAW ) , but the CEDAW committee has called on the nation to enact anti-domestic-violence laws . The committee also expressed concern about three Lebanese penalcode articles , which mitigate guilt in the case of so-called honor crimes , tolerate marital rape and allow for charges to be dropped in rape cases . Though no current statistics on domestic violence in Lebanon exist , a 2006 study reported family violence as a common , significant health issue . There is lip-service support for women from politicians , itself uncommon in many Arab countries , but nobody will act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for changing discriminatory laws , says women 's rights are one of many issues stuck on the back burner until the politics are sorted through : " It 's not just gender that 's being shelved , it 's anticorruption laws , economic reforms , living conditions . " For women , however , political instability led by patriarchal party politics is n't a valid justification for the slow speed of gender reforms . There are only six women in Parliament , most of them widows or members of political dynasties ( Hariri 's sister , Bahia , is minister of education , the Cabinet 's sole woman ) . MP Ghinwa Jalloul did introduce a bill to change the nationality law in 2006 , but she 's been quiet on the issue since the war . The women MPs " are not effective , they 're just following their men and have no independent opinions , " says Ikbal al-Shayeb Ghanem , former vice president of the Lebanese Council of Women , an umbrella NGO for over 170 women 's groups . Ghanem has worked to introduce a gender quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible now because of the situation , but we ca n't wait on the time being right , " Ghanem says . " People are watching TV , watching politics . We 're trying our best to awaken them to their rights . Once we get through , they say , ' Thank you ! ' " - IMAN AZZI
