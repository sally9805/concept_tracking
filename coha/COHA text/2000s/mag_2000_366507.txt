The crowd in Hilton Head last Wednesday morning was n't much to brag about  --  roughly 250 people had shown up at a local marina to hear George W. Bush  --  but the candidate was pumped just the same . In the big debate the night before , he 'd finally managed to get the better of John McCain . More important , Bush had unleashed the dogs of war against his rival  --  saturation TV and radio attacks , hundreds of thousands of telephone and direct-mail blasts , everything short of leaflets dropping from the skies above South Carolina . The dogs were tearing into McCain , raising questions about his character and dedication to the conservative cause . Bush told the crowd , in his new fire-in-the-belly style , " If you 're sick and tired of the politics of cynicism , of polls and principles , come and join this campaign . " His slip of the tongue about being tired of principles hinted at what happened in South Carolina : Bush believed he would be finished if he lost the state , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that played at the Hilton Head rally neatly summed up Bush 's approach . Its refrain : " I 'm really good at gettin ' by . " <P> Want a reformer ? Bush asked his party in South Carolina . I 'll be your reformer  --  but a safer and more predictable one than McCain . Want a fighter who can take it to Al Gore ? I can play rough  --  look what I did to my Republican rival . I can court the radical right and come out shining brightly . I 'm really good at gettin ' by . <P> So good , in fact , that Bush did more than get by in South Carolina . He trounced McCain by 11 points overall , beating him handily among nearly all age groups , both genders and most income levels  --  among everyone , in fact , except veterans and new G.O.P-primary voters . South Carolina Republicans rejected McCain 's message that " this party has lost its way , " voting for Bush almost 3 to 1 . The independents and Democrats who made up about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there were n't enough of them to keep things close . Exit polls show that a majority of voters saw Bush as the " real reformer "  --  an astonishing coup for the Texas Governor , who adopted McCain 's mantle of reform just two weeks ago . Of those who believed McCain was the true reformer , more than a third voted for Bush anyway . For all its demographic changes in recent years , South Carolina remains wary of mavericks and loyal to the G.O.P establishment . It was the third consecutive time a Republican front runner had lost New Hampshire and regained his balance in South Carolina . The fire wall held . <P> Bush 's slashing tactics  --  ferocious even by South Carolina 's down-and-dirty standards  --  do n't fully account for the size of his victory . Bush managed to drive McCain 's negative ratings from 5 to 30 in a month , but he also benefited from his own more serious and improvisatory style . Gone were the photo ops of Bush bowling and snowmobiling , replaced by substantive town-hall forums that looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all was his hard charge to the right on social issues : he boosted conservative Christian turnout to record levels and collected two-thirds of their votes . But the things he said and did to win them could cost him down the road .
