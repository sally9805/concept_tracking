ROSE DOWNIE SAT ON THE COLD COBBLES , CRADLING a swaddled baby that was not hers . <br> She leaned her aching back against the wall of the imposing stone house , close to its arched oak door . Under any other circumstance , nothing could have brought her near this building where baleful apprehension hung heavy in the air like the stink of tallow , but the man who lived here , Richard Topcliffe , was her last hope . She had been to the court of law , and the justice merely shook his head dismissively and said that even had he believed her-and that , he said with a scowl , was as unlikely as apple blossom in November-there was nothing he could do for her . <br> The constable had been no more helpful . " Mistress Downie , " he said , " put the baby in a bag like a kitten and throw it in the Thames . What use is it alive ?

" <br> Now , outside Topcliffe 's house in the snow-flecked street , close by St. Margaret 's churchyard in Westminster , Rose sat and waited . She had knocked at the door once already , and it had been answered by a sturdy youth with a thin beard who looked her up and down with distaste and told her to go away . She refused and he closed the door in her face .

Rose was fair , young , no more than seventeen with a face that , in other times , sparkled with smiles . She shivered uncontrollably in her heavy gowns and clutched the baby close to share what little warmth she had . Occasionally she lifted a large , well-formed breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was free-flowing and rich and her need of relief was almost as insistent as the child 's hunger . Steam rose from her breast in the icy winter air . The child sucked at her with ferocity and she was thankful for it . Monstrous as she considered the baby , some instinct still made her keep it and feed it , even though it was not hers . The day moved on into darkness , but she was as immovable as stone . <br> Continues ...
