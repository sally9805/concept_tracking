1 The Summons One night in early November 1779 , he dreamed a terrifying dream . He saw a skiff dancing across Charleston Harbor , running before an offshore breeze that raised what mariners called white horses on the water . Lydia sat in the skiff 's bow , laughing and enjoying herself ; her hair flew in the wind like a yellow banner . He could n't see the face of the man at the tiller , only his back . But he was not the man , of that he was sure . Though he was athletic , a superb horseman , he 'd never learned to swim or sail . His mother called it passing strange , since his father , a wharf owner , made his living from the commerce of the creeks and rivers and oceans . Unseen bells began to peal-the eight church bells of St. Michael 's parish , cast by Messrs . Lester and Pack , London , where he lay dreaming . The bells did n't ring the sequence of notes that called the faithful to Sunday worship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a fire , an impending hurricane . Great danger . When he woke in his room on the third floor above Fountain Court , the meaning of the dream came clear . He 'd been absent from America a year and a half . The desirable young woman he wanted to marry could be slipping away from him . Edward Bell , twenty-one , was at that time studying at the Middle Temple . He had resisted his father 's wish to send him there , saying , " I have no ambition to practice law in South Carolina . " " Nor do most of the young men from Charleston who enroll at the Inns of Court , but it will be useful . It broadens you , like a grand tour . It makes you a keener student of business contracts . It prepares you to be a leader of society-to hold office if you wish . " " Why not send Adrian ? He 's firstborn . " " I do n't mean to speak unkindly of your brother , but to be truthful , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man . Shrewd is not the same as smart . " " But we 're in the middle of a war with England . " " Where do you think we learned that we have a right to rebel against the injustices of the king 's ministers ? From English constitutional law , taught at the Middle Temple . Who stood up to the king in Parliament and defended our right to rebel ? Edmund Burke , of the Middle Temple . " " Is this a scheme to keep me out of the militia ? " " Do you want to join the militia , Edward ? " " Not particularly . I 'm not an ardent patriot like you . " " You 're more of one than your brother . Worry about the militia at such time as the British return to Carolina . It may never happen . They 've left us alone three years now . " In ' 76 , Col. William Moultrie and his brave men had repulsed an invasion attempt at the palmetto log fort on nearby Sullivan 's Island , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Henry Clinton and Adm . Sir Peter Parker sailed away and Great Britain concentrated on fighting in the North . Edward ran out of objections . Soon thereafter he departed for London and the Inns of Court . * * * On a cold but windless evening in early December , he left his apartment in Essex Court , crossed Fountain Court , and entered Middle Temple Hall . Edward was a tall and lanky young man , not handsome , but possessed of strong features and an engaging smile . There was no fat on him . He 'd inherited his height and build from his father , Tom Bell . He was dressed like a sober colonial in a double-breasted kersey greatcoat , a white stock and lace cravat , black leather top boots , and a black felt hat with a flat crown and broad brim . He owned a wig but preferred to keep his brown hair tied back with a black ribbon . He carried a stout walking stick for self-defense at night . In the corridor he passed a broad open doorway on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great hall , a high cathedral of a room walled with plaques bearing the arms of the Templars from whom the Middle Temple took its name . Student friends of Edward 's were deep into port and private argument , even as an old lawyer droned on from the dais . Something about torts , in which Edward had no interest . Since coming to London he 'd spent most of his time at gambling clubs , cockfights , bearbaitings , and his favorite table at the Carolina Coffeehouse in Birchin Lane , where he hobnobbed with rowdy clerks from the London branch of Crokatt 's , a Charleston trading firm . No one in the Temple 's great hall noticed him as he slipped by . A door at the end of the corridor brought him to the water gate . As usual , a boatman stood by , waiting to bear a young gentleman off to the night 's adventures . Edward stepped down on a thwart . " South Bank . I 'll show you where . " Half an hour later he elbowed his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the floor in the center of a large , bare room . Noisy and smoky , the room opened off a narrow passage fittingly called Cocker 's Alley . It was packed with roughly dressed lowlifes and young men in fancy silks and powdered wigs . The pit 's carpeted floor was strewn with feathers . Dark stains showed where birds had bled . Cocks ready for their matches crowed periodically , adding to the racket . Edward spoke to a stout man . " Anyone special here tonight ? " " Corday 's here , with his black-breasted red . Won the three-day main at Clerkenwell last week . " " Corday . " Edward frowned . He 'd had run-ins with that gentleman , chiefly over the American rebellion . Mr. Clive Corday had come down from Oxford to study at Gray 's Inn . He was notorious for spending even less time at it than Edward did . He was well placed ; a relative sat in the House of Lords . Edward always bet against Corday 's birds because he detested the man . A shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him carrying the bird . The black-breasted red weighed almost five pounds , Edward guessed . He was a fierce bird with cropped tail feathers , a comb cut into a half moon , and steel fighting spurs . Corday greeted his admirers boisterously . He was a fleshy young dandy with a round face perpetually red and sweaty . He always dressed with fashionable flamboyance , in this case a coat of Italian silk with vertical red and white stripes , a solid red waistcoat , and striped knee stockings that matched his coat . Corday was contemptuous of the American colonies and all who lived there . It showed when he spied Edward and favored him with a slow nod , a scornful smile . Edward returned the nod , pulled his purse from his pocket , and pointed at the contender . Corday 's face reddened all the more . " Save my spot , if you please . " Edward tipped the stout man tuppence and went off to bet . Corday 's first opponent , a loutish fellow wearing farmer 's boots , stepped up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird had already lost . At a signal from the master of the matches , Corday and his opponent pitted their birds close to one another , then quickly retreated to the floor outside the oval . Corday 's red crowed defiantly . The birds circled one another , darting their heads forward . Suddenly the red flew at the opponent and began to slash with its beak and spurs . The patrons applauded and yelled profane encouragements . The birds fought fiercely , leaping off the carpet , slashing and pecking . The red disposed of the smaller cock in ten minutes . It lay dying , its head flopping on its neck , its side torn open and bleeding . Edward had wagered two shillings and lost . Corday glanced at him with a smug smile , then turned to accept congratulations from a crowd of sycophants . A second challenger carried his bird into the pit . This one lasted almost half an hour before the red disposed of it . The third opponent died in twenty minutes , and the red finished off the fourth and fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red while , in the back of the hall , the next contenders crowed raucously . Corday 's prize was ten guineas . Having steadfastly bet against him , Edward had lost ten shillings of his father 's money . Corday found Edward in the crowd . " Another bad evening , Mr. Bell ? " Corday stuck his thumbs in the pockets of his fine waistcoat . Trickles of sweat had washed powder from his wig onto his temples . Edward stared him down . " I 'll get my money back one day . " " Wagering against my big red ? I doubt it . You Americans never know when you 're whipped . Well , you soon will be , now that Clinton 's at sea . " " What are you talking about ? " " Letter from a cousin in New York . Serves aboard the flagship of Admiral Arbuthnot . Big armada 's forming up , to sail within the month . Sir Henry Clinton , nine thousand men-a major campaign in the South . I do n't doubt they 'll wall up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was stunning news , though perhaps Edward should have seen it coming . A month ago a letter from his father had reported that the British were disquieted because they 'd been unable to win a significant victory in the North . Further , the French now stood with the Americans in the war . No doubt Clinton had smarted ever since the defeat at Fort Moultrie . It made a new attack on Charleston seem inevitable . Tom Bell 's letter had sounded a further note of melancholy . Charleston 's revolutionary zeal , so hot five years earlier , was waning as the economically hurtful war dragged on . Corday took advantage of Edward 's stunned silence . " It would surely suit me if you were one of those beaten down by General Clinton , Mr. Bell . You 're nothing but an ill-bred parvenu . What 's more , you dress atrociously . " " And you 're an arrogant ass , Mr. Corday . You dress like a whoremonger . " Corday 's hand flew up to deliver a stinging slap . Edward staggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land another blow . Edward rammed his stick into Corday 's middle , throwing him off-stride . The crowd gave them room . Patrons applauded and encouraged Corday . Edward dropped the stick , swung up his right fist , and blasted Corday 's chin from underneath . With his left fist he hammered Corday 's soft belly . Corday slipped to his knees , gagging . Edward seized Corday 's collar at the nape , pushed hard , and slammed his forehead on the floor twice . Corday flopped on his side . His wig fell off , baring his shaved skull . Edward snatched up his stick and bashed Corday with the knobby end . Clawing at the floor , Corday struggled to rise . Edward hit him again and Corday stretched out with a sigh . All around him Edward heard ominous grumblings from Corday 's partisans . He waved his stick at those nearest- " One side , damn you " - and they fell back . He left the building at a fast walk , not eager to become a victim of a mob . Once into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the water stairs . He lost his hat and did n't go back for it . Crossing the river , he made a decision . It was time to abandon his studies . The new British campaign could mean great danger for his family , but more persuasive , perhaps , was the dream : the bells ringing the alarm , an unseen rival stealing Lydia . He wanted Lydia Glass with all his young man 's blood and fire . He had n't heard from her since arriving in London ; she said she never wrote letters . It was time to go home , before he lost her .
