As long as the rink is frozen , you can count on Russian teams winning medals in pairs and ice dancing . Russian men have even had the golden touch , collecting three championships in the past three Olympics , but oddly enough , no Russian woman has won Olympic gold in women 's figure skating . <P> That dry spell may end in Salt Lake City , if either Irina Slutskaya , 22 , or Maria Butyrskaya , 29 , skate to their potential . While their shaky performances at last month 's European championships bode well for the Americans , Slutskaya has defeated Michelle Kwan each time they have competed this season , while Butyrskaya grabbed gold from Kwan at the 1999 world championships . <P> Like Sarah Hughes , Slutskaya is a natural and powerful jumper . If she can repeat her feat from last year 's world championships of stringing together three jumps in a row , she may make history as the first Russian women 's gold medalist . <P> Butyrskaya also wants that distinction . The lanky Muscovite is known to skate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam in the 4-min. free program , she has a good shot . <P> On the men 's side , either Alexei Yagudin , a three-time world champion , or teammate Evgeny Plushenko , the reigning world gold medalist , will probably keep up the Russian men 's gold streak . Yagudin , who trains in the U.S. , is a passionate performer and is eager to redeem his fifth-place finish in Nagano . Plushenko is just as talented but far less polished . While his music and choreography are often disjointed , he is the only male to lasso one leg up and behind his head and hold this position during a spin . <P> The strong singles teams , however , may have come at the expense of the traditionally favored pairs and ice dancers . Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier will challenge the Russians in pairs , while teams from France and Canada could finish ahead of the leading Russian ice-dancing entry . <P>  --  A.P .
