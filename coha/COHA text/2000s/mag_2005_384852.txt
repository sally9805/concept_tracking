LEGALIZING DRUGS IN PRO CYCLING MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY TO CURE WHAT AILS IT . // Did Tyler Hamilton take blood transfusions before winning his Olympic gold medal ? Are Filip Meirhaeghe and David Millar , both of whom were suspended for using EPO , scoundrels ? * I do n't care . * I 'm more worried about the local crackhead taking a crowbar to my neighbor 's PT Cruiser , and that is n't a flippant remark . Somehow , we 've managed to confuse athletes who break the rules with lowlifes . Millar and Meirhaeghe are cheats , and they 're paying for it . Those who condemn Hamilton do so in terms that would have you believe he 's hoarding dead bodies in his basement . We 've gone nuts-in our deliciously puritanical and American way-over what bike racers are putting into their bodies . We 're nuts when we see our athletes as white knights and superheroes who seemingly succeed on moral purity and pure grit . And we 're nuts when we act as if we are the victims of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of virtue we wished they were . Breaking the rules ? It 's the rules that are broken . Message to the self-righteous : Whether you 're the fastest guy in your club , or a couch potato whose TV is permanently tuned to OLN , if you 're not earning a living as a pro athlete , then to imagine that your abilities-fueled , at most , by a couple of espressos-have anything to do with the way the guilty ( or the innocent ) in the professional peloton conduct their activities is a sign that you are almost certainly confusing your reality with theirs . The job of the pro is to win . That 's all . The implications of this can be hard to understand if we hold down " regular " gigs where we try to do our best , but ca n't always , and are forgiven for it . We have a few triumphs , cash our paychecks , and get satisfaction by playing with our kids , taking in the scenery as we pedal , and doing the thousands of other things world-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at your job , you had to be better than everyone else or you would n't be able to feed your family , gas your car or own a home . Imagine if you were given only a tiny timeframe in which to achieve that . Imagine if mistakes were forbidden . Now , imagine if there was a pill that would guarantee your success . Imagine that not taking such a pill would almost certainly ensure failure . While you 're imagining , I also have a message to the athletes : end the confessions and denials . When we focus on the behavior of a single athlete , be it Hamilton , Lance Armstrong or Babe Ruth , we 're forced into an impossible position . We end up wondering whether anyone who wins and tests clean is n't a better cheat than those who lack the luck , dollars or technical dexterity to not get caught . Instead , it is time for athletes to speak out about a system that leaves decent people suspected of being liars or cheaters , or both . We can argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guarantee that more cyclists are getting away with taking banned substances than are getting caught , especially because you ca n't test for what you do n't know exists-and new drugs are always being created . We can argue for a two-class system , clean and dirty categories , but we know , deep down , that nobody will care about the drug-free competition . Excitement is always best provided by those who risk everything to win . But there 's a simple solution . Legalize it . Athletes are n't junkies . We need to stop viewing doping as a criminal activity-even if in some foreign countries , such as Italy , athletes can go to jail for " crimes against sport " when they dope . A better attitude would be to look at what doping really is-a training tool , albeit an extreme one-and compile a list of approved substances . The only caveat : Each pro would be required to fully and publicly list what he or she is using , and athletes would have to do it under the watchful eye ( and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts . After all , there will always be new ways to cheat . Some of these means will be dangerous , and will need to be policed . But what if we made sure that the best ( and safest ) enhancements were legal and medically regulated ? This would-along with some very draconian rules , like an absolute lifetime ban for using drugs not on the books-provide a disincentive for illegal experimentation . It is n't pretty . But it does acknowledge reality , and it better protects athletes . No longer would they have to rely on unqualified personnel to administer substances of unknown origin ; this alone would greatly reduce health risks . We need to start considering performance enhancement as a legitimate part of a bike racer 's arsenal , just like vitamins , oxygen tents , energy bars and Sheryl Crow . This is the only way to level the playing field . What about athletes who refused to use drugs and , presumably , lost , seeing their careers destroyed because they were playing by the rules ? This would be a serious problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world championship indicates , the clean riders are already losing races . Another objection might he the message such a shift sends to kids . Mom , Dad , there 's a chance that some players on the local high-school football team are already half-crazed on steroids . I do n't think kids should take performance-enhancing drugs at all , but if they are , it is n't the example set by the professional athletes that 's driving them to do so ; the motivating factors are the rewards of athletic success . Even high-school jocks know that winning will get them dates , a car , maybe even money . Setting an example for kids is important . But if we , as adults , have the opportunity to create a world where one fewer person our children idolize is forced to tell lies and cheat , we should seize it . The message that legalizing drugs in professional sports might send is far less damaging , I think , than the disillusionment kids feel when they find out that their heroes are phonies . Again , this sounds outlandish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and regulations , not morality and criminality . Bike racing is beautiful because it 's complicated . It is in the sport 's shades of gray where we find true color . This sport , more than any other , mimics-over the ebb and flow of a threeweek stage race or a championship mountain bike season-the triumphs and disappointments of real life . Professional cycling might be perceived as dirty by those who read the headlines and are aghast at the constant string of denials , accusations , positive tests and intrigues , but that 's because there are ways for a bike racer to be caught-doping tests , customs officers , disgruntled former team members ratting on riders , police raiding athletes ' hotel rooms-that our mainstream American sports stars ca n't imagine enduring . Can you envision the NYPD conducting searches of Jason Giambi 's locker at Yankee Stadium ? My point is n't to say that one sport is cleaner , or dirtier , or better , or worse than any other . What I 'm saying is that cycling is our most grueling and gorgeous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most imbued with pain and suffering , the one that happens in public , on our streets and in our villages , where we can touch and smell the competitors , and understand how they honor us as they pass by . Adding a little honesty-and exposing a lot more gray-would only make it more so . Sidebar DEAR DAN EAT LESS , RIDE MORE I 've been riding for years . Recently I 've started to ride more to get in shape . The only thing is , I ca n't stick to a good diet , and it discourages me . Can I still get in shape and feel good about myself without changing my diet ? - Ricardo Chavez . Gardena , CA Did nt I see you down at the donut shop the other morning ? You and I , my brother , have the same problem . The thing Is , I love good food , bad food , and everything In between . I think that guy on the Pringles can Is a genius . I 'd like to tell you that this Is healthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'll manage to stay fit despite what you ( and I ) choose to dine on each day . But this isnt the case . However , the level of exercise you perform gives you tons of leeway-enough dietary room to drive several Ice cream trucks through , at least . So do nt be too hard on yourself : Try your best , keep riding and remember that pizza exists to make us happy . How far should I ride each day ? - James Jenkins , Williamston , NC Far enough to get back to where you started . Not so far that you have to sleep curled up In a ball on the side of the trail . What is the trickiest stunt ever performed ? - Marc Hurley , Taunton , MA Moses parting the Red Sea ? Evel Kneivel 's attempt to rocket over the Snake River Canyon ? Any crash sequence from Cannonball Run ? These are all worthy stunts , but the trickiest of all is getting out of the house three or four days a week and riding , and doing that week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still finding it fun . How to do it ? Never forget that a bike ride Is a present that you give to yourself . Give Dan a present ; ask him a question . If he likes you ( Dan 's fickle ) he 'll reciprocate by replying with something sage or at least sassy . Go to www.MOUNTAINBIKE.com/hug and make Dan 's day . // <p>
