Section : Business Goldman Sachs rules the Street with smarts and tough tactics . But has it gone too far with the Big Board deal ? <p> For investment bankers , this would be a dream scenario : to serve as an adviser on a major deal and own a piece of both companies that are merging . That way , the deal can pay off in fees and a jump in the value of either company . Such a deal , though , remains a dream for most Wall Street firms , who worry they 'd attract scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest . <p> Yet for Goldman Sachs , this is n't wishful thinking  --  it 's precisely what 's happening in the pending merger of the New York Stock Exchange and the electronic-trading firm Archipelago . Goldman , led by CEO Hank Paulson , served as the banker that brought them together ; the investment bank owns 15 percent of Archipelago , and it is also one of the NYSE seatholders , giving it the right to trade shares and an ownership stake in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldman co-president ) . A top Goldman exec , Duncan Niederauer , until recently also sat on Archipelago 's board , and played a key role initiating the merger . Goldman 's payoff if the deal goes through : as much as $200 million . Goldman says it has done nothing wrong because it fully disclosed its many roles . Paulson declined to be interviewed . <p> The NYSE deal is perhaps the most obvious example of a fact of life on Wall Street : that Goldman , with its connections , smarts and tough tactics , wields power like no other firm . " They are the first among equals in many fields , " says securities-law professor John Coffee . Yet there is a chance that the deal , just a week away from a vote , could unravel , sending a message to Goldman that it overreached . State court Judge Charles Ramos , during a hearing last week with dissident NYSE seatholders , raised the issue of whether " somebody missed the boat " in assigning a value to the Big Board . The NYSE agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vastly different , the merger could be blocked , exposing Goldman to potential suits from seatholders who feel they were shortchanged . <p> The court challenge has roiled Goldman . William Higgins , the NYSE member opposing the merger , brought as evidence e-mails he obtained through discovery that show Goldman discussing conflicts in the deal . ( One junior banker wrote : " That 's freakin ' amazing  --  same team of ppl people on both sides ? ' And later : " How did that get through conflicts ? ? ' ' ) In another , Niederauer wondered if Thain had the " intestinal fortitude " to go through with the merger , prompting an angry outburst from Thain when he learned about the remarks , Goldman confirms . ( Thain had no comment . ) Several top Goldman execs now carry a second BlackBerry for private e-mail . " Right now , you can boil an egg on Hank 's forehead , " said one Goldman exec who did n't want to be named because he was speaking about his boss , Paulson . <p> Goldman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many entanglements . Refco , the commodities brokerage that filed for bankruptcy last month , asked Goldman to be an adviser when it came under fire . Others on the Street cried foul , noting that Goldman was an underwriter of Refco 's recent stock offering and could be held liable for missing its accounting problems . Goldman resigned from the job . <p> While Goldman may be seeing the limits of its power , no one questions the firm 's business acumen . It pioneered the practice of assigning executives to stay close to top CEOs so that it would be on the shortlist for any investment-banking work . Paulson will wake up at 3 a.m. to call clients , and he tried to work a connection to get a piece of Google 's initial stock offering , though Google did n't want any solicitations ( Goldman was largely shut out of the offering after Google learned of Paulson 's efforts ) . <p> One competitive advantage is the cachet Goldman derives from its network of powerful friends and alumni , including cabinet officials and politicians . A top executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second cousin of President George W. Bush . He and Paulson earned " pioneer " status for contributing $100,000 or more during the recent campaign . Former Goldman co-president John Thornton , who left in 2003 to teach at Tsinghua University in Beijing , remains a senior adviser . <p> Relationships help explain what 's driving the NYSE deal . Goldman execs have long said that the exchange 's system , using floor traders , was outdated . But Goldman encountered strong resistance from Richard Grasso , who for years was NYSE chairman . When Grasso 's $140 million pay package came to light in 2003 , Paulson helped remove him . Thain ultimately replaced Grasso and proposed the merger . There are other ties between Goldman and the NYSE . NEWSWEEK has learned that Margaret Tutwiler  --  the NYSE 's head of communications and government affairs and former State Department spokeswoman  --  shares a Manhattan apartment with Paulson 's chief of staff , John Rogers , during the workweek . Goldman and the NYSE confirmed the living arrangement and said it was a matter of convenience while they live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends for more than 30 years . Goldman said Rogers recommended Tutwiler for the job . <p> For his part , Niederauer has been eying a potential NYSE-Archipelago merger since at least 2000 , when he became Goldman 's rep on the Archipelago board . During one meeting , he listed on a white board several potential merger partners and then drew an arrow from Archipelago to the NYSE , people at Goldman confirm ( Niederauer would n't comment ) . Niederauer , known inside Goldman as the wizard of Oz because of his behind-the-scenes power , has long argued that electronic systems are more efficient , less costly and reduce the possibility of fraud . " I do n't want five guys named Vinny executing my trades , " he once quipped , according to a former NYSE board member who asked not to be named because of the ongoing litigation . After someone passed along the comment to Grasso , according to the board member , he responded with a famous line from the movie " Animal House " : " Neidermeyer  --  dead ! " ( Neither Niederauer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help explain why some on Wall Street refer to the NYSE as the " Goldman Sachs Exchange . " And many believe that nickname wo n't change ; even if the independent valuation suggests the initial deal terms were off the mark , the dissident seatholders may be outvoted by colleagues ( the value of their seats has more than tripled in the past year ) . It 's safe to assume that at least 21 votes will be for the deal . That 's how many seats Goldman owns . But beyond the NYSE , it holds far more seats of power . <p> Ties That Bind : Goldman Sachs 's cachet gets a boost from high-profile former and current execs .
