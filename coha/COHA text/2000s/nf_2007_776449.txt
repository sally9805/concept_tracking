THE FEDERALIST // WAR OF IDEAS // For a long time , during the middle of the twentieth century , it was n't even clear what it meant to be a judicial conservative . Then , with great suddenness , during the presidency of Ronald Reagan , judges and lawyers on the right found a voice and an agenda . Their goals reflected and reinforced the political goals of the conservative wing of the Republican Party . // Earl Warren , who served as chief justice of the United States from 1953 to 1969 , exerted a powerful and lasting influence over American law . The former California governor , who was appointed by Dwight D. Eisenhower , put the fight against state-sponsored racism at the heart of his agenda . Starting in 1954 , with Brown v. Board of Education , which outlawed segregation in public education , the justices began more than a dozen years of sustained , and usually unanimous , pressure against the forces of official segregation . Within the legal profession in particular , Warren 's record on civil rights gave him tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Brennan Jr. , his close friend and strategist , used that capital to push the law in more liberal directions in countless other areas as well . On freedom of speech , on the rights of criminal suspects , on the emerging field of privacy , the Warren Court transformed American law . // To be sure , Warren faced opposition , but many of his Court 's decisions quickly worked their way into the permanent substructure of American law . New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , which protected newspapers that published controversial speech ; Miranda v. Arizona , which established new rules for interrogating criminal suspects ; even Griswold v. Connecticut , which announced a right of married people to buy birth control , under the broader heading of privacy-all these cases , along with the Warren Court 's many pronouncements on race , became unassailable precedents . // Richard M. Nixon won the presidency in part by promising to rein in the liberalism of the Court , but even though he had the good fortune to name four justices in three years , the law itself wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon named to succeed Warren , the Court in some respects became more liberal than ever . It was under Burger that the court approved the use of school busing , expanded free speech well beyond Sullivan , forced Nixon himself to turn over the Watergate tapes , and even , for a time , ended all executions in the United States . Roe v. Wade , the abortion rights decision that still defines judicial liberalism , passed by a 7-2 vote in 1973 , with three of the four Nixon nominees ( Burger , Lewis F. Powell , and Harry A. Blackmun ) in the majority . Only Rehnquist , joined by Byron R. White , appointed by John F. Kennedy , dissented. // Through all these years  --  from the 1950s through the 1970s-the conservatives on the Court like White and Potter Stewart did not differ greatly from their liberal colleagues . The conservatives were less willing to second-guess the work of police officers and to reverse criminal convictions ; they were more willing to limit remedies for past racial discrimination ; they deferred somewhat more to elected officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the big legal questions , the war was over , and the liberals had won . And their victories went beyond the judgments of the Supreme Court . The Warren Court transformed virtually the entire legal culture , especially law schools . // *** // It was not surprising , then , that on the day after Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980 , Yale Law School went into mourning . On that day , Steven Calabresi 's torts professor canceled class to talk about what was happening in the country . The mood in the room was one of bewilderment and hurt . At the end , the teacher asked for a show of hands among the ninety first-year students before him . How many had voted for Carter and how many for Reagan ? Only Calabresi and one other student had supported the Republican . // The informal poll revealed a larger truth about law schools at the time . Most professors at these institutions were liberal , a fact that reflected changes that had taken place in the profession as a whole . The left-leaning decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthodoxy , and support among faculty for such causes as affirmative action and abortion rights was overwhelming . // But even law schools were not totally immune from the trends that were pushing the nation 's politics to the right , and a small group of students like Calabresi decided to turn these inchoate tendencies into something more enduring . Along with Lee Liberman and David McIntosh , two friends from Yale College who had gone on to law school at the University of Chicago , Calabresi decided to start an organization that would serve as a platform to discuss and advocate conservative ideas in legal thought . They considered several names that would showcase their erudition- " The Ludwig von Mises Society , " and " The Alexander Bickel Society " - but they settled on a more elegant choice . They called themselves the Federalist Society , after the early American patriots who fought for the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 . Calabresi 's guide on the Yale Law School faculty was Professor Robert Bork . Liberman and McIntosh started a Federalist branch at Chicago and recruited as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea for a conservative legal organization was perfectly timed , and not just because of the Republican ascendancy in electoral politics . In this period , liberalism may have been supreme at law schools , but it was hardly an intellectually dynamic force . In the 1960s , liberal scholars at Yale and elsewhere were writing the law review articles that gave intellectual heft to the decisions of the Warren Court , but by the eighties , the failures of the Carter administration turned many traditional Democrats away from the practical realities of law to a more exotic passion  --  advocating ( or decrying ) a movement known as Critical Legal Studies . Drawing heavily on the work of thinkers like the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci and the French poststructuralist Jacques Derrida , CLS devotees attacked the idea that law could be a system of neutral principles , or even one that could create a fairer and more just society . Rather , they viewed law mainly as a tool of oppression that the powerful used against the weak . Whatever its ultimate merits , CLS was singularly inconsequential outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it largely irrelevant to the work of judges and lawmakers . At law schools , then , the field was largely open for a vigorous conservative insurgency . // So the Federalist Society both reflected and propelled the growth of the conservative movement . It held its first national conference in 1982 , and by the following year there were chapters in more than a dozen law schools . Recognizing the intellectual potential of the society , conservative organizations like the John M. Olin and Scaife foundations made important early grants that allowed the Federalists to establish a full-time office in Washington . The Reagan administration began hiring Federalist members as staffers and , of course , appointing them as judicial nominees , with Bork and Scalia as the most famous examples . ( Bork and Scalia both went on the D.C. Circuit in 1982 . Calabresi himself went on to be a professor of law at Northwestern. ) // The young Federalists who started organizing in the early eighties did not merely strive to recapitulate the tactics of their conservative elders . The prior generation , those who waged their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred " judicial restraint " to " judicial activism . " For conservatives like Justices Stewart or John Marshall Harlan II , who were two frequent dissenters from Warren Court decisions , the core idea was that judges should defer to the democratic branches of government and thus resist the temptation to overturn statutes or veto the actions of government officials . But the new generation of conservatives had more audacious goals . Indeed , they did not believe in judicial restraint , and they represented a new kind of judicial activism themselves . They believed that constitutional law had taken some profoundly wrong turns , and they were not shy about demanding that the courts take the lead in restoring the rightful order . // *** // With the election of Ronald Reagan , conservative ideas suddenly had important new sponsors in Washington . Reagan was elected on promises of shrinking the federal government , which he proposed to do by cutting the budgets for social programs . Many in the Federalist Society sought a legal route to the same goal . Back in 1905 , the Supreme Court had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a maximum number of hours for bakers was unconstitutional because it violated the bakers ' freedom of contract under the Fourteenth Amendment 's protection of " liberty " and " property . " By the 1940s , the Roosevelt appointees to the Supreme Court had repudiated the " Lochner era , " and for decades no one had seriously suggested that there might be constitutional limits on the scope of the federal government 's power . Then , suddenly , in the Reagan years , some conservatives started questioning that wisdom and asserting that much of what the federal government did was unconstitutional . ( The second event ever sponsored by the Federalist Society was a speech at Yale in 1982 by Professor Richard Epstein of the University of Chicago Law School in favor of Lochner v. New York . ) While Reagan was arguing that Congress should not pass regulations , the Federalists were saying that , under the Constitution , Congress could not . // Edwin Meese III , Reagan 's attorney general in his second term , provided a framework for the emerging conservative critique of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisprudence of original intention . " The words of the Constitution , he said , meant only what the authors of the document thought they meant . Or , as the leading " originalist , " Robert Bork , put it , " The framers ' intentions with respect to freedoms are the sole legitimate premise from which constitutional analysis may proceed . " According to Bork , the meaning of the words did not evolve over time . This was an unprecedented view of the Constitution in modern times . Even before the Warren Court , most justices thought that the words of the Constitution were to be interpreted in light of a variety of factors , beyond just the intentions of the framers . As the originalists ' greatest adversary , William Brennan , observed in 1985 , " the genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone , but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and current needs . " // In large measure , the debate over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over legalized abortion . No one argued that the authors of the Constitution intended for their words to prohibit states from regulating a woman 's reproductive choices ; to Bork and Scalia , that ended the debate over whether the Supreme Court should protect a woman 's right to choose . If the framers did not believe that the Constitution protected a woman 's right to an abortion , then the Supreme Court should never recognize any such right either . In the Roe decision itself , Harry Blackmun had acknowledged that the words of the Constitution did not compel his decision . " The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy , " Blackmun had written , but the Court had over time " recognized that a right of personal privacy , or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy , does exist under the Constitution . " The interpretive leap of Roe was Blackmun 's conclusion for the Court that " this right of privacy . . . is broad enough to encompass a woman 's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new generation of conservatives in Washington during the Reagan years began trying to persuade the Court to reverse . // *** // One of those young lawyers was Samuel A. Alito Jr. , who was just six years out of law school when he joined the staff of the Justice Department shortly after Reagan was inaugurated in 1981 . Four years later , he was presented with a classic dilemma for a committed legal conservative : how best to persuade the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade - all at once or a little bit at a time ? // In 1982 , Pennsylvania had tightened its restrictions on abortion , including requiring that women be prevented from undergoing the procedure without first hearing a detailed series of announcements about its risks . The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had declared most of the new rules unconstitutional  --  as violations of the right to privacy and the rule of Roe v. Wade . Alito had joined the staff of the solicitor general , the president 's chief advocate before the Supreme Court , and he was assigned the job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persuade the Supreme Court to preserve the Pennsylvania law . Around that time , over the Reagan administration 's objection , a majority of the justices had reaffirmed their support of Roe . The question for Alito was what to do in light of the justices ' intransigence . In a memo to his boss on May 30 , 1985 , Alito wrote , " No one seriously believes that the Court is about to overrule Roe . But the Court 's decision to review the Pennsylvania case may be a positive sign . " He continued , " By taking these cases , the Court may be signaling an inclination to cut back . What can be made of this opportunity to advance the goals of bringing about the eventual overruling of Roe v. Wade and , in the meantime , of mitigating its effects ? " Alito wound up recommending an aggressive line of attack against Roe . " We should make clear that we disagree with Roe v. Wade and would welcome the opportunity to brief the issue of whether , and if so to what extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at the same time , the Justice Department should defend the Pennsylvania law as consistent with Roe and the Court 's other abortion decisions . // The solicitor general filed a brief much in line with what Alito recommended , but the case , Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , turned out to be a clear defeat for the Reagan administration . In a stinging , almost contemptuous opinion , written by Blackmun , the Court rejected the Pennsylvania law , declaring , " The States are not free , under the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life , to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies . " In a plain message to the conservative activists now in charge at the Justice Department , he wrote , " The constitutional principles that led this Court to its decisions in 1973 still provide the compelling reason for recognizing the constitutional dimensions of a woman 's right to decide whether to end her pregnancy . " Raising the rhetorical stakes , Blackmun went on to quote Earl Warren 's words for the Court in Brown v. Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality of these constitutional principles can not be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them . " To Blackmun , the war on Roe was morally little different from the " massive resistance " that met the Court 's desegregation decisions a generation earlier . // But while Roe commanded a majority of seven justices in 1973 , the decision in Thornburgh was supported by only a bare majority of five in 1986 . So within the Reagan administration , the lesson of the case was obvious  --  and one that conservatives took to heart . They did n't need better arguments ; they just needed new justices . //
