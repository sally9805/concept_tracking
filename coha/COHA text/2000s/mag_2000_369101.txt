Real people should not be on television , " host Garry Shandling declared at the Emmys , to cheers from a crowd of nervous actors . Reality TV dominated 2000 , providing some of its best shows ( see No. 1 ) and ickiest lows ( remember Rick Rockwell ? ) . TV had other fantasy-reality conflicts : Leonardo DiCaprio played an ABC journalist with Bill Clinton ; CBS 's Early Show digitized its logo onto video of Manhattan ; and then there was election night . At the Emmys , reality lost out . There 's no award for nonscripted shows , and The West Wing 's airbrushed depictions of our better angels beat the The Sopranos ' gritty realism . Sometimes fantasy still bites . <P> 1 SURVIVOR ( CBS ) When 16 people battled on hot Pulau Tiga for a cool million , the " snakes and rats " proved Sartre right : Hell is other people . The biggest prime-time soap since Dallas was an addictively tacky social chess game , full of societal metaphors and water-cooler fodder . It achieved everything good TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN THE MIDDLE ( Fox ) . More lovable than Raymond , more destructive than Ebola , the sugar-buzzed Malcolm dropped a firecracker down the shorts of the family-sitcom genre . Jane Kaczmarek , as ferocious , loyal Lois , is not just a mom but the life force . <P> 3 THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN ( BBC America , Comedy Central ) . Part Monty Python , part Blue Velvet , this macabre British comedy introduced the murderous town of Royston Vasey ( slogan : " You 'll never leave ! " ) and three gifted sketch comics who played more than 60 bizarre but richly defined characters . <P> 4 GILMORE GIRLS ( The WB ) . Planned as family-friendly TV , Gilmore was meant to be Good and ended up good . A charming story of a happily unwed mom and a brainy teen whose life is n't defined by boys , it shows that feminism and family values are n't mutually exclusive . <P> 5 THE TALLY HASSLE IN TALLAHASSEE After TV fumbled its Florida projections , it landed a tailor-made story . The recount saga stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news covers best : raw politics and lawsuits . At last , a story that cable could n't blow out of proportion . <P> 6 WONDERLAND ( ABC ) . TV loves shootings and heart attacks but has ignored mental illness . The best medical show in years went inside a psychiatric hospital with clear-eyed compassion and depth . Two ill-rated airings later , ABC , like society , chose to look the other way again . <P> 7 FIRST PERSON ( Bravo ) . Filmmaker Errol Morris beautifully shot these profiles of odd obsessives ( a squid hunter , an abattoir designer ) . In his trademark style , he had his subjects tell their stories gazing straight into the lens ; their eyes were windows to the surreal . <P> 8 THE TOM GREEN CANCER SPECIAL ( MTV ) . In the Year of Celeb Health  --  Dave 's heart , Michael 's Parkinson 's  --  Green 's testicular cancer was the most creatively rewarding affliction . Green took his gross-out comedy to a new level on an unflinching show that took quite a pair to make . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushers in this miniseries would have been anonymous , two-dimensional perps and problems on a cop drama , but here they swelled to life fully realized and unromanticized . Khandi Alexander gave TV 's performance of the year .
