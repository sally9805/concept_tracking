<p> It 's happening here now <p> Editor  --  Regarding your page six story , " Men from 5 more countries will have to report to INS " ( Jan. 16 ) , perhaps I can suggest a final solution : armbands ! Would n't it be simpler to just have all males of Middle-Easttern descent wear identifying armbands with a symbol ? INS officers could then question them , and anyone looking suspiciously Middle Eastern , at will ? <p> As a demonstration that the United States is genuinely concerned with their safety , we could wall off sections of cities , giving Middle Easterners their own ( assigned ) communities . We could employ the healthiest and strongest in our factories to ensure their continued well-being . <p> Of course , as acts of terrorism in the United States are certain to explode once we launch a war on Iraq , our best doctors could devise methods of questioning our " guests " that would ensure their compliance .

To honor the real meaning of sanctity : For one day , let us drop no bombs and prepare for no wars . Let us not aid and abet the death of children through sanctions and suffering . Let us put aside our fancy cars and our nuclear power  --  even if there 's nowhere safe and certain to put our toxic waste . <p> Release each so-called illegal immigrant , everyone held without charges in this presumed land of the free . Open up the prisons ; blot out racism , classism , bigotry , hate . Sweep the battering from our homes , end rape , torture and shame . Call for silence on the killing fields . Let women affirm and support life according to the dictates of our own conscience . Let all people wake to see the sun , the sky and the stars without fear . <p> JULIA WATTS BELSER <p> Berkeley <p> KAISER DUBYA <p> Editor  --  Recently , I was reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " by Barbara Tuchman . She quotes the German kaiser , before World War I , as saying , " I told him I could not be played with . Whoever in the case of a European war was not with me was against me . " <p> Where have I heard that in the last couple of years ? <p> JOHN RICCI <p> San Francisco <p> HATEFUL TRUTH <p> Editor  --  Debra J. Saunders ' column , " Class warfare " ( Jan. 16 ) , was a classic in what liberals hate most , the truth . Who serves in the military , who gets killed and who does n't when there is a war will cause copious heartburn and proof of accuracy from the left-wingers of our society . <p> T. R. FORBES <p> Novato <p> JUST DOING THE JOB <p> Editor  --  I believe columnist Joan Ryan ( " Women and Uncle Sam. , " Jan 14 ) missed the basic concept , proven by firefighters , police and others striving for equality  --  including some enlightened high school sports programs .

Aside from committing the cardinal sin of giving away the ending to a movie , he sees nothing more remarkable in " About Schmidt " than what he imagines to be a typically liberal Hollywood smirk at " the stereotypical Midwesterner whose taciturnity is presumably symptomatic not of still waters running deep , but only of a low emotional metabolism . " Could it be that Will distorts through the lens of his own cynicism what Schmidt is actually feeling in that final frame ? <p> Will attempts to shanghai " About Schmidt " into deodorizing his own flatulent ideology . He implies that liberal thinking in the tradition of Sinclair Lewis disingenuously enlists the everyman it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Will 's universe , money and power only make those who wield them more sensitive to the human condition . In the universe where I live , that 's called science fiction . <p> DAVID KELSO <p> Oakland <p> KEVIN COOPER 'S GUILT <p> Editor  --  I was surprised to read California Death Row inmate Kevin Cooper 's letter in The Chronicle ( " A voice from San Quentin 's Death Row , " Jan. 15 ) asserting his innocence . In 1985 , Cooper was convicted of repeatedly stabbing and hacking to death Doug and Peggy Ryen , their 10-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old houseguest in Southern California . Cooper had escaped from an area prison and was hiding near the family 's house before he decided to kill his victims and steal the family 's car . <p> A unanimous jury sentenced Cooper to death for the crimes . Many are aware of several tragic Illinois cases where innocent men were wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to death . Unlike those cases , Cooper has been given excellent and free legal representation and been allowed dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades . Moreover , notwithstanding the fact that the state Supreme Court found the trial evidence " overwhelmingly " proved Cooper 's guilt , my office helped Cooper become the state 's first Death Row inmate to obtain post-conviction DNA testing . Unfortunately for Cooper , the results only served to further reinforce and support the jury 's finding of guilt . <p> Regardless of how one feels about the death penalty , you can rest assured that California is not Illinois , and Mr. Cooper is not an innocent man . <p> BILL LOCKYER <p> Attorney General <p> Sacramento <p> HILLSBOROUGH PROTESTS <p> Editor  --  Gov . Gray Davis ' proposal to reapportion our property taxes from our own school district toward state needs is insane . Never has anyone ever felt it was their right to use our money inappropriately . We have sacrificed and saved our money to buy our home in Hillsborough so our children can enjoy a higher standard of education . <p> In addition to our higher taxes , our constant efforts of fund-raising and contributing to our school districts makes it our right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The money is collected by our efforts , therefore we are to be the recipients of our funds . <p> MARY LEE <p> Hillsborough <p> LOSING TRUST IN COPS <p> Editor  --  The removal of Lt. Joe Dutto , midstream into the investigation of Alex Fagan Jr . and other SFPD members , is reminiscent of previous actions to avoid the truth . The inference of a coverup and not the actual dirty deed has ended the careers of many a public servant . As the trust of the citizenry evaporates from those we charge with our security and safety , so goes this city 's once admired reputation as a peaceful refuge for all . <p> L.A and New York experienced this phenomenon many years ago . If you ca n't trust a cop , who can you trust ? I for one , do n't want to live in a city where the average law-abiding person has to keep watch over both shoulders . <p> JIM WEIR <p> San Francisco <p> A NARROW INSULT <p> Editor  --  Henry Chang Jr . ( Open Forum , " A lesson for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attempt at humor toward Yao Ming as narrow-minded . Unfortunately , Chang spends the rest of his piece hung up on race , and his errors and misguided thoughts reveal a certain narrow-mindedness in their own right . <p> Chang asserts that O'Neal 's comment is an insult to all Asians . I have to believe I 'm not the only one of Asian descent to disagree , though I do find O'Neal 's ignorance pitiful . What I do resent is having all Asians painted under a broad brush by people like Chang . Ming is a basketball player from China . Thus , O'Neal 's insensitivity in this incident was toward Chinese . I fail to understand how O'Neal 's behavior would necessarily be insulting to all of the vast array of non-Chinese individuals and groups that originate from the Asian continent . <p> For that matter , could n't O'Neal 's comments be insulting to non-Asians as well ? Instead of turning an ethnic issue into a racial one on the O'Neal-Ming incident , Chang might have chosen to write about civility or public relations instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editor  --  Your Jan. 16 story ( " Zoo penguins intent on futile ' migration ' " ) detailing the bizarre behavior of the San Francisco Zoo 's penguin population clearly illustrates the problems inherent with keeping wild animals in captivity . No matter how realistically designers attempt to recreate natural habitat , they can not . Wild animals are meant to be wild , not kept in pretty prisons called zoos . <p> JOHN BENNETT <p> San Francisco <p> MEYER CLASSIC <p> Editor  --  If Tom Meyer is n't the best editorial cartoonist in the business , who is ( Editorial cartoon , Jan. 16 ) ? His take on the 49er coaching fiasco with Mooch 's caricature stabbed in the back by a Sharpie and the 49er brass , including the obvious caricature of Bill Walsh running from the scene of the crime , is a classic . <p> JOHN FREDERICKSON <p> Clayton <p> Some quarter designs not worth a dime <p> Editor  --  My thanks to The Chronicle and Ken Coupland for his review of the designs suggested for California 's commemorative quarter ( " Drawn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep at least one coin commemorating each state so far , and they 're certainly a mixed bag . <p> My initial criterion in making a choice : Does this design really remind me of my beloved native state ? Is it simple , straightforward and memorable ? Will it never fail to evoke " California " even into the next century ? Coin 11 , abstract ocean waves , would serve as well for Bermuda or Spitsbergen or Hawaii . I also do n't understand how No. 12 , the Spartan warrior , qualifies as a shorthand description of my beloved state . What was that artist thinking about ? No. 2 ( bridge and palms ) No. 6 ( film strip ) , No. 7 ( trees ) , No. 8 ( a hodgepodge ) , No. 10 ( another hodgepodge ) , Nos. 13 , 14 and 19 ( cluttered ) are neither simple nor memorable . A cornucopia , No. 5 , is certainly a cliche . Coin 17 ( the big tree ) is a work in progress . The artist got the scientific name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrections , it could be one of my finalists . I like No. 1 ( Muir and Half Dome ) No. 3 ( bear and Half Dome ) and No. 18 ( gold seeker ) . <p> I 'd eliminate all bridges , palm trees , cornucopias , film strips , abstract waves and stylized Greeks . Then I 'd eliminate clutter . What 's unique to California ? Certainly the three trees : oldest ( bristlecone pine ) , largest ( Wawona grove big tree ) and tallest ( coast redwood ) . Certainly Yosemite . When you 've gotten this far , it remains only to choose from among the designs that incorporate these elements . <p> PAUL AZEVEDO <p> Pacifica . <p> Editor  --  Ken Coupland starts on the right track in his assessment of California 's next icon , the state quarter . Coin 11 , depicting the sun over stylized waves , is indeed " striking . " But when he asks " What does it mean ? " he falls into the same literal-minded trap that all of the other quarter designers fell into . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is about gold miners and a bridge . California is where people come to escape from America . <p> The fundamental truth , which is I think what the designers of Coin 11 were after , is that California is different . We are so different that the rest of the country thinks we are freaks . Well , OK then  --  let our freak flag fly . <p> BEN PAULOS <p> El Cerrito . <p>  --  Of all the Open Forum articles I have read over the years , Ken Coupland 's tops the list of those that fall under the category of " I know more than you and let me tell you just how dumb the rest of you are . " <p> So Coupland does n't like the majority of the final design choices for our state quarter , calling them " a tedious array of cluttered , uninspired designs " and a " combo platter of tiresomely antiquated iconography . " The quarter design is supposed to be representative of California history and uniqueness , not to satisfy Coupland 's desire for a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Concord . <p> Editor  --  The quarter design No. 11 might be more appropriate than we would like . It shows the sun setting on the California economy awash in a sea of red ink . No. 3 is about the only one that will not create the controversy from hell . <p> JAMES TENNEY <p> Eureka
