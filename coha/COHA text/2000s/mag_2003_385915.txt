Section : Business It 's a cult classic : Kozlowski cavorting in Sardinia at Tyco stockholders ' expense . Too bad fund managers did n't make videos as they lived it up and stuck investors with the tab . <p> His trial is n't even close to over , but L. Dennis Kozlowski , the former chief executive of Tyco , was convicted last week  --  of bad taste . The verdict was rendered by the viewing public when prosecutors in Kozlowski 's criminal trial showed about 20 minutes of what has to be the cheesiest corporate video ever , shot at the $2 million birthday party Kozlowski threw for his wife on the Italian island of Sardinia . The Roman-themed party featured scantily clad men cavorting lubriciously with women in diaphanous gowns , an oiled male model gyrating on a pedestal , enough flaming torches to burn entire cities and Jimmy Buffett singing " Brown-Eyed Girl " and other favorites for a one-night fee of $250,000 . Mercifully , the judge barred shots of the ice sculpture of Michelangelo 's " David " urinating vodka , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a birthday cake shaped like a woman . <p> The tab for the party , held in June 2001 , was petty cash in the scheme of things . Kozlowski stuck Tyco with a bill for slightly more than $1 million , a minuscule part of the $600 million prosecutors charge him and his codefendant with looting from the company . But 20 minutes of video can leave more of an impression on a jury than 200 pages ' worth of eye-glazing financial maneuvers . Tyco paid more than half the party 's costs , prosecutors charge , only because Kozlowski manipulated the firm into combining it with a business event of sorts . Kozlowski 's lawyers say it was a legitimate corporate expense . <p> As scenes of this debut-de-siecle excess were being replayed endlessly on computer screens and cable TV last week , another example of tacky and outrageous behavior surfaced , this time involving mutual funds . The tie to the Tyco trial ? Mutual-fund insiders stand accused of the same kind of " it 's my party and I 'm gon na get everyone else to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the country 's biggest fund managers , venerable Putnam Investments , with allowing managers to enrich themselves by making improper trades in the shares of the funds they were running . Think of it as an overpaid babysitter supplementing his income by looting your kid 's piggy bank . Then news leaked that one of the fund industry 's most prominent and richest managers , Richard Strong , is likely to be indicted soon . The founder of the Strong Funds is accused of enriching himself , his family and " friends " to the tune of $600,000 or so by improperly trading shares of funds that his firm manages . <p> There could be more revelations this week , possibly involving fund insiders trading stocks based on what they knew their funds were planning to do . On Monday , New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer is scheduled to star in Senate hearings about the fund industry . Spitzer kicked off the fund scandal in September by exposing illicit relationships between a big hedge fund and four mutual-fund companies . In an interview with NEWSWEEK , Spitzer declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd unveil , but he continued his weeklong attack on the Securities and Exchange Commission . " The regulators at the SEC seem to have been oblivious to what was going on , " Spitzer said . The SEC has broad powers over funds , fund companies and advisers , but apparently knew nothing about the fund abuses that Spitzer has exposed . An SEC spokesman declined to comment on Spitzer 's barbs . SEC regulators say they have n't had the resources they need to properly monitor the huge and sprawling mutual-fund industry . <p> There 's no memorable video of fund folks cavorting in togas , alas , but their alleged behavior seems as penny ante as Kozlowski 's . Take Dick Strong , who 's worth $800 million , according to Forbes magazine . Most of that wealth consists of his ownership stake in the company that manages the Strong Funds . Regulatory sources say Strong made a series of improper rapid-fire trades from 1998 through 2001 for some of his own accounts and about a dozen other people . The idea that the owner of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his funds ' shareholders is heresy . <p> If these allegations are accurate  --  Strong 's lawyers say he did nothing illegal but wo n't discuss details  --  Dick Strong has put his empire , 30 years in the making , at risk for petty cash . At the least , Strong is almost certain to be booted from his job . His management company will have to deal with shareholder defections and lawsuits . At worst , the supposedly independent directors of the individual Strong funds may develop some backbone , fire Strong and hire untainted management to run the funds . If that happens , Strong 's management company could become almost worthless . <p> Putnam , the nation 's sixth largest fund company , according to Financial Research Corp. , has similar problems . The firm is owned by Marsh &; McLennan , which would suffer grievous harm if the Putnam management company imploded . <p> According to the cases brought by the SEC and Massachusetts regulators last week , Putnam caught some of its managers making improper trades but did n't stop them . Rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his initial case in September . Putnam could probably have bought its way out of trouble by immediately firing the managers and reimbursing fund shareholders for the allegedly illicit profits , apparently a few million dollars . The Putnam management company was probably worth at least $5 billion , pre-scandal . But now , big accounts like the state of Massachusetts are fleeing , lawsuits are looming and there 's always the chance that the Putnam funds ' directors will exercise their right to hire new managers . <p> As corporate and fund scandals pile up , a clear pattern is emerging . Rich executives and managers , many of whom had more money than most of us could spend in a lifetime , could n't seem to stop themselves from trying to grab a little more . Now , like Dennis Kozlowski , they 're paying the price for going too far . Making money is fine . But overreaching and tackiness are n't . <p> Back in June 2001 , when Tyco reigned and the words " mutual fund " and " scandal " were n't connected , Kozlowski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest beginnings to become a corporate titan worth hundreds of millions of dollars . But instead of paying the full tab for his wife 's party , which he could have easily afforded , he got Tyco to fork over a crummy million bucks . Sure , even if he had paid for the party himself , he 'd still be on trial for embezzlement . But prosecutors would n't have been able to get the party video into evidence . Kozlowski would still have some shreds of his reputation left , perhaps , and would have a better chance with the jury . But those of us with broadband connections would n't be having so much fun . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Crass Act : The 40th-birthday party Kozlowski threw for his wife ( above , second from left ) and roughly 70 guests at the Italian resort Cala di Volpe cost about $2 million ; Tyco footed more than half the bill .
