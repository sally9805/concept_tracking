CHAPTER ONE DECEMBER 1 11:26 P.M. The dark blue car snaked around the curve , its headlights slicing like razors through the dead air . It slithered through the neighborhood , hunting for food , sniffing out its prey . With one punch , the large engine muscled up from thirty-five to sixty in less than three seconds , its hunger for speed ravenous . The man crossing the street caught a glimpse of the looming vehicle and twisted backward , shoving his companion toward the sidewalk  - -  But there was n't time . The car 's bone-crushing impact threw the woman onto its hood , then tossed her aside ... while the engine yanked the man underneath its front end , swallowing him whole . The dark vehicle lurched slightly as its tire ran over the fallen prey . It then sped off down the street , hung a sharp left , and slipped into the pitch of night . 11:59 P.M. The man 's torso was twisted , his head a bloody mess , with bits of brain tissue scattered around his crushed skull . The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the car 's hood after being thrown up into the air by the initial impact . Her legs appeared to be broken and were bent into an unnatural position , the way a rag doll sometimes lands when a child tosses it aside after she has finished playing with it . Most of the available officers in the City of Sacramento that night had been diverted to the minority neighborhood of Del Morro Heights to contain an escalating battle sparked by a broad crackdown on gang-related activities . When the call came in to investigate the discovery of a possible hit-and-run several blocks away , the twoofficers who responded anticipated more of the same , an offshoot of the hostilities . But they were wrong . Officer Larry Sanford slammed his car door and ran over to the woman , who was lying faceup in the street ; the other victim was obviously deceased . Both were black , he noticed . Sanford pulled a hand out of his leather glove and felt her neck for a pulse . " Shit , " he said , the vapor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night air . He looked up and down the street , but saw no one . He glanced over to his partner and shook his head . " Dispatch , this is Unit Nine , " the other officer said . " We 've got a Code Twenty on San Domingo Street . Notify homicide . Securing crime scene . " " Roger , Unit Nine . " " She 's still warm , " Sanford said . " Let 's get this area secured . " Using a roll of yellow warning tape , he established the boundaries of the crime scene while his partner blocked off the street and its adjoining arteries with traffic cones . Although out of the academy only six months , they both knew the routine : quick response , safeguard and preserve . That is , secure the crime scene to protect all materials in the vicinity because everything was considered evidence until proven otherwise . No one  --  not even another police officer  --  was to enter the crime scene until the detectives arrived . One of the most significant threats to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scene was to be disturbed , moved , stepped on , or contaminated in any manner . With the thermometer at 33 degrees , Sanford rolled up the fur collar on his standard-issue blue nylon jacket and shoved his hands into his pockets . He sucked a mouthful of damp air into his lungs : rain was on the way . He sent his partner back to the gang-related conflict while he stood watch over the crime scene . In his boxing days , Detective Bill Jennings had a flat , rock hard gut . Some thirty years later , the musculature was stretched thin by the ravages of abuse , resulting in a bulging beer belly . Nevertheless , he carried his weight well and never hesitated to throw it around , both literally and figuratively ... sometimes for the better , and sometimes for the worse . By the time Jennings arrived at San Domingo Street , his partner , Angela Moreno , was already there surveying the scene . Moreno , thirty-five years old with short-clipped brown hair , nodded at Jennings as he approached . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , what , three hours ? " " What 've we got here ? " he asked as they walked over to the two bodies . " Looks like a hit-and-run . Got two of ' em , " she said , kneeling down in front of one of the victims . " And we 've got some broken glass . A headlight , " she said , turning over a large fragment and looking through it . " Do n't touch it , " Jennings said , grasping her arm . " Saperstein should be here in a few minutes . " " You called Saperstein again ? " " He was the one on call . " " You have n't even looked over the scene . It 's just a hit-and-run . We do n't need a criminalist poking his nose all over the damn street to tell us what we already know . " " The man single-handedly saved my career , Angela . " Moreno waved a hand . " I read the reports , Bill . It was a clean shoot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just shot and killed a black kid . The media had a juicy story and took it for a ride . And with the election and all , I was a fucking political hot potato ... people were tossing me around like I had the plague or something . " Jennings shook his head . " I was guilty before the body was cold . Everyone bailed out on me except Saperstein . " " I heard all about it . Do n't you think I checked you out before I took this assignment ? " " You never told me that , " he said . " You checked me out ? " " I vaguely remembered reading something in the paper about it . Then my Vice partner started getting on my case , telling me I should look into it . " She placed the glass fragment back where she had found it . " The comments you 'd made back in eighty-seven with Stockton PD did n't help any . " " Yeah , well those were taken out of context  --  " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I checked into it . " Jennings stood up , his five-nine frame putting him eye-to-eye with his partner . " When Saperstein took the stand and started explaining that the shoot happened the way I said it did , I felt vindicated . He had all these formulas that showed I was standing where I said I was , and that the perp had turned to fire on me . " He pulled a pair of crumpled leather gloves from his pocket and struggled to insert his pudgy fingers . " Without Saperstein 's analysis of the physical evidence , those accusations would still be hanging over my head . So do n't give me shit about using a criminalist . I 'm gon na use one anytime I can . And if you 're smart , when you 're primary , you will too . " " But this just looks like a simple hit-and-run , " Moreno said . " I do n't care . What it looks like and what it turns out to be may be two different things . I 'm not taking any chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just arrived on the scene , they quickly canvassed the surrounding blocks to try to ascertain if anyone had seen or heard anything relative to the murders . Thirty minutes had passed when a car drove up to the yellow police tape half a block away . Out stepped a man in his mid-forties , his hair an uncombed mess , his suit coat creased and covering a severely wrinkled shirt . Stuart Saperstein exchanged pleasantries with Jennings and received a cold reception from Moreno , who was apparently silently protesting his need to be there . No doubt sensing the tension , the criminalist excused himself and began the task of documenting the scene by arranging a handful of halogen floodlights a short distance from the bodies . He opened his field kit and within a couple of minutes was on his hands and knees , examining each of the bodies . He measured distances and calculated angles , dictating his findings into a microcassette recorder . Steam was rising off the hot floodlights against the cold , damp December air . Squinting at the ruler through his reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just arrived to photograph and document the scene . " As soon as I mark this , let 's get a series of shots . When you take the midrange shot , I want to be in it . " " You 're so vain , " Jennings said , leaning over his shoulder . " It helps for the jury to see me at the crime scene examining the physical evidence . It gives me an advantage over the defense 's expert  --  " " I know , I know . Just giving you shit . " Moreno shook her head and walked off down the block in the direction of an officer who was approaching with a man at his side . Saperstein stood up and faced Jennings . He tilted his head back and looked at the detective through his reading glasses , which were resting on the tip of his bulbous nose . " You look like shit . " " Thanks . So do you . " Saperstein smiled . " Yeah , but I always do . " He motioned to Moreno , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like me . " " Nothing personal . She just did n't think a criminalist was needed here . " " She 's new to Homicide , huh ? " " Transferred in from Vice three months ago . " " Well , I guess I 'll have to prove her wrong . Teach her a lesson . " Saperstein bent down to measure again . He was a perfectionist , and with good cause : when there were no obvious suspects , homicide detectives often relied heavily on the criminalist 's interpretation of the scene . If he could accurately ascertain what had happened , he could then surmise why it happened  --  which could help determine the sequence and mode of death , the victim 's position at the time of the deadly blow , or how many shots were fired in a gun-related homicide . Often , the physical evidence the criminalist gathered at the crime scene was enough to narrow the field of suspects , help locate the perpetrator , or obtain a confession from him . Jennings looked up and saw that Moreno was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness . As he made his way toward his partner , he rubbed his gloved hands together to bring blood and warmth to his numb fingertips . " What do we got ? " he asked as she flipped her notepad closed . Moreno nodded at the man to her left . " This is Clarence Hollowes . Says he heard a big bang around eleven-thirty , ran out into the street , and saw a car leaving the scene . " " I do n't want to get involved with no po-leece , " Hollowes said , jawing on a piece of gum . He was dressed in clothing that was even more wrinkled than Saperstein 's . He was unshaven and his hair was peppered with gray . " Is that right , " Jennings said . " Why not ? Got something to hide ? " " Po-leece mean trouble . That 's just the way it is . You get involved , you get in trouble . " " We 're not going to cause you any trouble , are we , detective ? " Jennings glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from having called Saperstein . He turned back to his witness . " What can you tell me about the car ? " " Well , as I was telling this lady here , it was dark colored . A fancy one , real shiny , kind of like a Mercedes . " " Was it like a Mercedes , or was it a Mercedes ? " " I 'm not an expert or nothing on fancy cars , but it was a Mercedes . I 'm pretty sure . " " He got a partial plate , " Moreno said . " Oh . You saw the license plate , sir ? " " Yeah , like I told her , I saw two numbers . A two and a C. " " Did you get a look at the driver ? " " Looked like a white guy . Wearing a baseball hat . " " Did you see a logo or anything on the hat ? " Jennings asked . He hesitated a moment . " Maybe there was something on it , I do n't remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know , a white guy . " " Old or young ? " " Neither . " " Beard ? " " Uh , no beard , I do n't think . " " Any distinguishing marks ? " " Just a white guy . Did n't see his face . Drove by me real fast . " " Did you see what color hair he had ? " Hollowes shrugged . " Nah , too dark . Too fast . " " What about the car ? Any dents , broken lights or windows ? " " Man , I do n't know . It happened fast , you see ? Bang , boom , I ran over and saw the car leaving . Then I saw them bodies in the street . " " I 'm gon na give you my card , " Jennings said as he pulled a wallet out of his jacket pocket . " Call me if the car comes by here again , or if any of your friends say they saw something , okay ? " He looked at Moreno . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got no address , " Hollowes said . Jennings had already guessed the man was homeless  --  which made him very grateful for the information he had provided . In his experience , the homeless tried not to get involved , preferring to function outside of society . " In that case , " Jennings said , " call us collect . " Hollowes took the card and studied it . " Oh , " Jennings said . " One last thing . Did you touch the bodies ? " " Touch them ? " he asked , looking down at the ground . " Now why would I do something like that ? " " You know , to get some change , a buck or two for food . " " I just took the cash , that 's all . Got ta eat , you know ? " " Did you take anything else ? It 's important that we know , " Jennings said . " You see ? Talk to the po-leece , get in trouble . " " No trouble , Mr. Hollowes . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have to know if you took a wallet , or anything like that . We 'd need the identification to tell us who these people are . " " No . Just the money . There was eight bucks in his wallet , twelve in hers . They were dead . They ai n't gon na miss it . " " Did you move the bodies in any way ? " " No . I did n't touch no dead bodies . Just took their money . " Jennings nodded . " Thanks again for your help . We 'll be in touch . " " They good people , " Hollowes said . " Who are ? " Moreno asked . " Them , " Hollowes said , nodding at the bodies . " You know who they are ? " " Ca n't remember their names . They help us get a place to stay on nights like this when the cold go way down to your bones . " " You mean they did this for the homeless , like it was their job ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is there anyone who 'd want to hurt them ? " Jennings asked . " None of us , that much I can tell you . They been good to us . " Moreno nodded . " If there 's anything else you think of , please give us a call . " Hollowes turned to walk away . " Them rich people think they can flash them fancy cars in our neighborhood ... " he said as he walked off out of range of the streetlight 's glow and into the shadows of a nearby tree . " I was wondering the same thing , " Jennings said to Moreno . " What the hell is a white guy doing driving a Mercedes in Del Morro Heights at eleven-thirty at night ? " " Taking a shortcut ? " " A shortcut on life , you mean . The guy 's lucky they did n't catch him . " " They ? " " The neighbors , " Jennings said as they walked back toward Saperstein . " It would 've made our job easier . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write up . " They exchanged a smile as Jennings fastened the top button of his overcoat . " You know , this could 've been personal , " Jennings said . " Something related to their work with the homeless . " Moreno nodded . " Possibly . " " Detective ! " yelled an officer who was jogging down the street toward them . " We just got a call from someone with a partial plate on the car . " " Another witness ? " Moreno asked . " Do n't know , " said the man , who was heaving mouthfuls of fog into the air . " It was an anonymous call . The desk sergeant thinks it was a female voice . She said she saw a dark Mercedes sports sedan , " he said , looking down at his notepad , " with a license of two , C , and O or U. Could n't see the driver 's face . Driver was wearing a baseball hat , and was weaving a bit about a block away from where we found the victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ? " Moreno asked . " No . " " Have them run a voice print analysis on the tape . I want to know more about this caller , " Jennings said . " Anonymous tips are bullshit . " " Ca n't get a voice print . " " Why the hell not ? " " Call did n't come in on the 9-1-1 line . She called the division directly . They do n't record incoming calls . She was in a real hurry to get off the line . Did n't want to get involved . " They headed back toward the bodies as a light rain began falling . " So what 's the story ? " he asked Saperstein , who was placing a couple of plastic bags filled with specimens into a nylon duffel bag , out of the drizzle . " Hit-and-run . The car left with a broken left headlight . " " That 's it ? A broken headlight ? " Moreno shook her head . " I already knew that . " Jennings , ignoring Moreno 's comment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallet . " What about the speed of the car ? " he asked Saperstein . " Judging by the damage to the bodies and the tire marks down the street , the driver must 've been accelerating . He came off that curve , " he said , nodding to the area down the street , " and brought it up to , oh , about fifty , maybe sixty , would be my preliminary estimate , at the time of impact . " Jennings looked over at Moreno , as if to say You would n't have known that . She threw him a look that had daggers attached to it . " What else can you tell us ? " Jennings asked , moving over to the woman 's purse and examining its contents . " It does n't appear as if the windshield was broken , " Saperstein said . " But I bet there 'll be clothing fibers on the wipers , and probably on the bumper or fender area . " Jennings nodded . " Oh , there 's something else . We can probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the male victim . " " What about the woman ? " " Judging by the position of her body , it appears that she was thrown onto the hood of the car . Probably died from internal hemorrhage . " " Are there any other tire marks in the street ? " " Aside from the one around the male and the one down the block , none that I 've seen , but I have n't had a chance to fully survey the entire roadway yet . Judging by the bloodstain patterns around the male victim , I 'd expect to find some blood on the underside of the suspect 's car , near the left front wheel . " " So it does n't look like the driver made any attempt to avoid them , " Jennings said . Saperstein removed his glasses . " Based on what I 've seen so far , I 'd say he was n't trying to get out of their way . If he had , we 'd see tire marks consistent with a swerve or intense braking . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb , or  --  " " He meant to hit them . " " Exactly . " Jennings nodded , thanked him , and asked for his report as soon as possible . As they walked away , Moreno was the first to speak . " I still do n't see his conclusions helping us much . " " We 'll see . We know more about what happened now than we did before , " he said . " Maybe the fact that the guy was accelerating and there are no skid marks supports the theory that it was n't an accident . Let 's do a background check on the victims . Could be there was someone who had something to gain if either of them wound up dead . Maybe there 's no homeless connection at all . Maybe one of them had a kid in a rival gang . Maybe the driver never did see them until it was too late , and it was just an accident . " " All right , all right , " she said , followed by a slight pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his car and spoke to the desk sergeant via radio , requesting assistance on locating the Mercedes with the partial license plate they had obtained . " I also need a background check on two people . " He opened the victims ' wallets . " An Otis Silvers , and an Imogene Pringle . " He removed a small piece of paper and studied it . " Pringle was carrying around a pay stub for the Homeless Advocate Society . It 's possible Silvers was with them too . See if we 've got anything on this homeless group while you 're at it . " " Anything else ? " " Yeah , which judge is on call tonight ? " The sergeant leafed through some papers on a clipboard . " You 're not gon na be happy . " " Do n't tell me it 's Ferguson . " " I hear he 's a bear when he gets called in the middle of the night . " " Just find me the owner of the car and I 'll worry about the damn warrant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and turned to Moreno . She threw a hand up to her mouth to stifle a yawn . " Oh , c'm on , these hours ca n't be worse than Vice , " he said . " No , Vice is worse . A couple all-nighters a week . But I have n't been on Vice for three months . My body 's not used to it anymore . " " Better snap out of it . It 's gon na be a long night . "
