I 'm not a teller of tales , not like the Rhymer . My voice is n't smooth , nor my tongue quick . I know a few tunes , everyone does , but nothing like his : from me you 'll never hear songs of gentle maidens fording seven rivers for their false lover so bittersweet as to make the hardest old soldiers weep ; nor yet merry ones of rich misers tricked out of their gold , with the twist of a word and a jest so neatly turned that the meanest old uncle that ever pinched a dowry still laughs without offense . Well , it 's a power , surely , that music and those words , and I just have n't got it . Not that I 'm sure I 'd take it , even if it were offered me . One of Tom 's very tales is of Jock of the Knowe , that was coming home from Mellerstain Fair with a long face , for he 'd walked all that way with his old shorthorned cow to sell at the fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's Jock returning to his goodwife with no money nor goods , and winter coming on . Jock 's going on down Mellerstain road with his cow , and he starts in railing at her , in a temper , like : " What would n't I give to be quit of you , and good money in my purse ? " Well , just then he sees a cloaked man by the side of the road . And the man says , " Good even to you , Jock of the Knowe . And how 's the milk from your shorthorned cow ? " Taking the stranger for some man from the fair , Jock answers , " Why , this cow gives half cream and half honey . And if she gives one bucket at morning , she gives two at evening . " They fall to bargaining over the price of the cow . It seems to Jock that anyone wandering the roads after the fair in search of a cow must be in a hard case , so he 's setting the price high . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver , but I can offer you something worth twice that , cow and all . " And he pulls out a fiddle . Jock says he ca n't even play , but the stranger says never mind , this fiddle does the playing for you . With that Jock sees that this twilight man must be one of Elvenkind . The cow 's milk is wanted for some human child they 've stolen . Now the fairy gold , if he takes it , could turn to grass and leaves tomorrow . But a magic fiddle 's a magic fiddle ; wherever you go people will give good money for music . So he says , " I 'll take the fiddle . " And , sure enough , when the exchange is made , the fairy takes the cow , and walks right up to the side of the hill , and raps with his staff three times . And the hill opens up , and fairy and cow disappear into it , right into Elfland . As for Jock with his fiddle , he never knows a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither , with folk from one end of the country to the other calling on him for music for dances and weddings and such . His goodwife sees only his money , for he 's never at home now . Oh , and every Beltane night , which is Fairies ' Holiday , Jock goes to that same hillside and plays , and out come a host of gorgeous folk that are the lords and ladies of Elfland , and they dance to Jock 's fiddle all night long , until his arms ache and his fingers are sore . The way I see it , that 's no way to live . He 'd have done better to keep the cow . But , then , I 'm a plain man . A crofter , living high in the hills above Leader Water with one wife , many sheep , few neighbors . I do n't even see a cow but twice a year at Earl 's Market . I 'd never seen anything like the Rhymer before he appeared on our doorstep . It was one of those dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huntsman calling up the Hounds of Hell , and you know there 's rain toward . And sure enough it came , battering at the roof and shutters , and not a little down the chimney so the fire smoked up the place . But there sat my Meg , nice as you please , sewing at a shirt for her niece 's eldest down Rutherford way . I was doing a bit of basketmending , glad that the flock were well penned up already this rough night . Between the rushlight and the fire 's glow we could see to work , or maybe it was our fingers remembering the way of it . Lately , light 's not as bright as once it was . Then the dog at my feet , Tray it would be , son of old Belta that was , Tray goes stiff like he 's heard something , though my ears caught nothing over the racket of wind and rain . " Soft , there , lad , " I say , like you do to a dog that 's spooking . " Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weather . " My Meg looks up . " Oh , Gavin , " she says , her voice strong against the noise of storm . " Gavin , it 's a night for the dead to ride , and no mistake . " She sounded like she was readying to tell one of her tales . Tales go well with dark nights ; like the one of that restless spirit , the Lord of Traquair , that rides on stormy nights seeking the wife he murdered in a jealous rage , looking to beg her innocent pardon . . . but her body 's long , long in the mold , and her blessed soul in Heaven . It happened not a day 's walk from here , across the river , some years gone by . " The Wild Hunt rides tonight . " Meg 's eyes glinted with her eerie tale . " They ride on horses with nostrils like burning coals , chasing the souls of the wicked , that can not rest for- " Then her head came up sharp . And , " Gavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " I thought her saying it was still part of the tale . Then I heard it too , a thud too regular for wind and rain . Tray was growling at my side , his hackles raised . I kept one hand on his head , for there 's no telling who might be abroad on such a night : or gypsy , or vagrant , or fiend from Hell . I took light in my other hand , and went and unbarred the door , good Tray by me . Standing there was a very tall , very wet hunchback , one shoulder higher than the other under a muddy dripping black cloak . He pushed back his hood as I raised my light to his face . I saw a young man , beardless but stubbled with travel , and dark hair falling into his eyes . " Blessings on this house , " he says , not the greeting of a Godless man , or one of the Other Ones . Tray growled . " Yes , " the stranger says to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could have been drier . And what do you think of this new fashion in yellow garters ? " I stared at him . " You 're talking to the dog , " I said . The stranger shook rain out of his eyes . " Well , he spoke to me first . I did not want to be rude . It makes such a bad impression . " For all I could see of his face in the flickering light , he meant it . " Gavin , " Meg calls , " mind the wind blowing in " - which was her way of telling me to stop standing there like a gawk . Well , we 'd had the stones blessed when we built the house , and rowan over the door against those Others . And it 's holy charity to shelter those wit-wandering . So , " Peace to all who enter here , " I muttered quickly , and stood aside to let the mad hunchback in . " I thank you . " He had to dip his head to pass under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meg sitting there . Still in his sodden cloak , he made a bow to my goodwife like any queen . I heard the smile in her voice as she said , " Be welcome to the house , harper . " And , sure enough , he drew the " hump " from off his shoulder : a harp wrapped tight in oilskin . While Meg busied herself wetting a handful of meal for hearthcakes , and setting milk to warm on the fire , he drew off his sodden wool cloak-more mud than wool-and if the house smelt powerful of wet sheep , there was nothing new in that . Sometimes when you 're doing or thinking on one thing , another comes of a sudden into your mind , or your mind 's the flash of a bright sunny day at Earl 's Market , with a woman stuffing a goose , of all things ! I looked at our visitor harder . His skin was pale , fine as a maiden 's , with the flush of returning heat coming to his cheeks like a sinner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the fire , and I saw the thin wool of them , dyed with some bright foreign dye such as we do n't see much hereabouts . Unfortunately , the dye had run onto the white cuffs of his shirt . Under one of them the glint of a gold band showed ; he saw me looking , but made no great shift to hide it . His hands were very harpers ' hands , long and supple and smooth . Meg handed him the welcome cup , saying , " I 'm Meg , and this is my goodman , Gavin , son of Coll Blacksides . " We hold by the old laws in these parts , so it was right that he know the names of his hosts , and be under no weird to give his own , but only to accept our hospitality if it went not against his honor or his kin 's . The harper shuddered as though shaking the last of the bone-chill out of him , and drank deep of Meg 's posset . " Never king was better feasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nonsense , and she dealt him the look she keeps for troublesome bairns , or chickens that stray from the yard . He coughed , smiled sweetly at her , coughed again to clear his throat , said even sweeter , " Ah , mistress , you think I flatter ! And , indeed , what call have you to take the word of a poor traveler with more mud on him than he left on the road , and a face to frighten the very bogles in the glen ? Is this a man , you say , to come before the king 's highness ? But , I beg you , picture me washed and combed , dry-shod and clad , a song on my lips and a harp in my hand . And so have I harped before the very king at Roxburgh . He was feasting at the time , and I have gazed with pleasure at the dishes set on his table . " He nodded with a grave air . " Aye ; seen , but not tasted , for harpers are to kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tray , who dozed fitfully at my feet , uneasy with the stranger . " Oh , I have watched our good king feast on the white bread and the marrow-and , like you , he sometimes throws his crumbs to the dogs . " And making only to scratch his head , he raised his arm so that his sleeve fell back to show us the gold bracelet . Well , it was a fool 's trick , if you ask me , risking much to show off : how was he to know we 'd not murder him for the gold ? It made me wonder how long the minstrel had been on the road , not to think of that . Still , I was curious to hear more : I 'm not much traveled myself , but I always like news of the world , and a good tale is welcome everywhere . We do n't get many passing through hereabouts , save the odd friar . It 's not that we had n't seen harpers before . There 's one usually stops at the fair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But none like this . I wondered if he really did know the king , and if he 'd harp for us . " Sir , " I began . But he held up one of his hands , very pretty , like he was halting a procession . " Goodman , " he says , " I am not deserving of that title , nor of any . I am but a plain man , whom it has pleased God to grant some gift of music and verse , and to find favor with the princes of the earth . " Now , I 'm not the sort to find fault in myself just because others do ; but for all his fine words , an older man would have put that better , so I did n't feel wrong about it . Oh , he was quick and clever enough . Still , there 's plenty of room for everyone in this world . I did n't say anything , and Meg clattered loud at the hearth , turning the cakes . The minstrel looks from one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some young dogs I 've known , that think to turn your mind from the mess they 've made with fetching of the ball . " Now , surely , friends , " he says , " you 've heard the tale of the Cat Who Spoke Truth to Kings ? " " No , " says Meg . " We have not . " I could tell she wished to hear it , but my Meg is a woman of sense . " And have you heard , " she says to him , " the tale of the lad who talked so much his tongue fell off ? " The wanderer laughed , breaking to cough . " I have not , " he says hoarsely . " I pray you , tell it me , for I am always looking for strange , unlikely tales to amuse folk with on my travels . " I held my breath , waiting for Meg to give him his come-uppance . Even as a lass she 'd never let folk get the better of her . The corners of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real laugh , not a tight one like his . And , " I 'm sure , " she says , " you know many a fine tale . And we 'll be pleased to hear them-when you 've gotten out of those wet clothes and had a bit to sup . You 'll take Gavin 's cloak that 's dry , for now , and lie next the fire this night . " He opened his hands , empty . " You understand-I have nothing to give you . " " Tch ! " Meg went from sweet to sharp in a flash . " Young man , do you think this house is Michaelmas Fair ? There 's no trading going on here . Now , you 've had a hard journey , so you 'll drink up your posset now and lie down nice by the fire . And when your own clothes are dry tomorrow you 'll have them back , and then if you like you can press on to wherever it is you 're in such a hurry to get to . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise in his voice . The minstrel coughed . Then he stood up , like in some lord 's hall . My old cloak hung only to his knees , and sat his well-made shoulders better than it ever did on me.
