<p> Terri Lynn Winchell left home on the last night of her life in January 1981 to help a boy she knew hated her . <p> That 's just the way she was , friends and family said . Good-hearted . A devout believer in turning the other cheek , in giving people a second chance . <p> But this was a chance she should not have given . <p> By the end of the evening , the 17-year-old church choir singer and high school beauty lay raped , hammered and stabbed to death , her corpse sprawled between two rows of grapevines . <p> She had no inkling of it , but she had been caught in the middle of a love triangle gone hideously bad . Her boyfriend , unbeknownst to her , had been involved in a gay relationship with another man  --  whose jealousy drove him to recruit a street thug who would take Winchell out of the picture . <p> Twenty-five years later , that early- ' 80s thug , Michael Morales , is due to be executed at San Quentin State Prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snorting , gulping or smoking every mind-twisting substance he could get his hands on . He would be the 14th person to be put to death in California since executions resumed in 1992 after a 25-year halt . <p> Morales is 46 now , and by his supporters ' accounts he has transformed himself into the sort of mild-mannered , devout Christian that his victim Winchell was . In his family 's eyes , he is a gentle artist , a remorseful , very loving and caring man who deserves a last-minute reprieve to avoid his appointment with the lethal injection chamber at 12:01 a.m . Tuesday , and should instead live out his years in prison without parole . <p> Not in the eyes of Winchell 's family . <p> No amount of apologies or personal transformation can make up for what Morales , then 21 , did to Winchell , they say . <p> " It 's been so long , but ever since I was a kid , I told myself I 'd be front row to see him die  --  and now it 's time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34-year-old Brian Chalk . " You lock somebody up for that long , sure they 're going to change . But that does n't change what happened . Or the loss . " <p> Chalk stood in the living room of his tidy south Sacramento suburban home and fell silent . He gazed at a walnut table along one wall , bristling with family photos  --  pictures of get-togethers , weddings , children born to his three brothers , all things that happened after the death of his only sister . <p> Winchell 's portrait stood in the center , a pretty girl frozen forever in adolescence , her early- ' 80s-style black hair falling below her shoulders to frame a confident smile . Chalk 's eyes moistened as they settled on it . <p> " I do n't want to sound vengeful or angry , " he said . " But enough is enough . "  --   --   --  <p> " Wholesome . " " Peppy . " " Classy . " " Someone who was going places in life . " <p> That 's how classmates at Lodi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her senior year . And the memories are fresh today , even after nearly three decades . <p> " She was n't just beautiful , she had this beautiful alto voice , " said Jodie Bluhm , who sang in the Tokay A Cappella Choir with Winchell . " Everybody liked her . She would sit down at the piano and start to sing , and everybody stopped what they were doing just to listen . " <p> Winchell was a straight-A student , excelled at tennis and swimming , and sang everywhere she could  --  in churches all over the Stockton-Lodi area , at school , at parties . " Bridge Over Troubled Water " was one of her signature tunes ; cassettes preserved by the family reveal a gentle , crystalline vocal talent . <p> She had just become lead singer of a rock band called Hit and taken a part-time job at an El Torito restaurant to raise money for college . Her mother , Barbara Christian , had retired in 1980 as a dispatcher for the Stockton Police Department , and with her newfound time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolgirl . <p> " Terri had everything going for her , " Chalk said . " She was my mom 's best friend . Every girl wanted to be her , and if they were boys they wanted to be near her . " <p> One of those boys was a 19-year-old baseball player at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton . He was a churchgoer and a good student , like Winchell , and after she met him on a church-choir gig they began dating . But something seemed a bit off . <p> " We had a funny feeling about him , even though he was a good ol ' American-looking guy and seemed nice to Terri , " Chalk said . " It seemed like he always had his head down , never looked us in the eyes . Like he had something to hide . " <p> It turned out he did . <p> While dating Winchell , the boyfriend was carrying on a secret affair with 19-year-old Ricky Ortega , whom he had met when the two were at Lincoln High School in Stockton . Ortega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their group of pals , but his jealousy soured so deeply he began needling her all the time , making it clear he disliked her . It did n't help that Winchell kidded Ortega that he seemed gay  --  never knowing how close to the truth she was . <p> The boyfriend was becoming terrified of Ortega as well , he said in an interview last week with The Chronicle . He begged the paper not to name him , saying he is now happily married with children who have no idea what happened all those years ago . <p> " Ricky threatened me , and he threatened to kill my mother if I did n't do it with him , " he said . " He broke my windows out at 1 a.m. once , he was so mad . I just did n't know what to do . " <p> The stress of the forced relationship , he said , was in direct opposition to his romance with Winchell . " She was so talented , so full of life and energy , " he said . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But where some saw beauty and talent , Ortega saw only rivalry . By late 1980 , he 'd had enough . He began scheming on how to get rid of his romantic competition , according to court testimony , but felt he could n't do it himself . <p> So he called the toughest guy he knew : his cousin Morales , a member of the Little Unity Latino gang . <p> Morales , prosecutors say , told Ortega he 'd be happy to help administer some payback.  --   --   --  <p> Morales , like Winchell , grew up in Lodi in a big churchgoing family , one of six children . He was a quiet , gentle boy who delivered newspapers at 12 , court recollections of friends show . However , as he became a teenager , he began clashing with his father for drinking beer and wearing gang fashions of the time  --  Pendleton shirts buttoned at the throat and baggy pants . <p> At 15 the relationship imploded , and Morales was thrown out of the house . He dropped out of high school and bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There he took up with the gang and began abusing alcohol and every drug he could find , from amphetamines and cocaine to the powerful psychotic PCP . Along the way , he fathered three children and supported himself by committing petty crimes . <p> " The fact is that in my youth I did lose myself for a few years , " Morales wrote recently in his petition to Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger for clemency , the words so neatly inscribed they look as if they were from a printer . <p> He called it " a dark period in my life " and described himself in those days as " a person of loose conduct and poor attitude . " <p> Then , right around New Year 's 1981 , came the request from Ortega . <p> According to court testimony , Morales began plotting ways to kill Winchell , practicing how to strangle someone by wrapping a belt around a female roommate 's neck and cranking it tight . Once he had the technique down , he waited for the call to action . It came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortega , pretending to want to ease tensions with Winchell , called her house around 5:30 p.m. as she was heading out the door to buy food for her mother , who was ill . He told her he wanted her help buying a gift at a local shopping center . Eager to mend fences , Winchell agreed to go , relatives testified . <p> Ortega picked her up around 6 p.m . In the back seat was Morales , with a claw hammer , a belt and a 7-inch kitchen knife hidden and ready . He was already stoned and agitated from guzzling cheap Thunderbird wine and smoking a PCP-laced cigarette . <p> As night fell and the Central Valley tule fog formed , Ortega drove his car out of Lodi along lonely Peltier Road . According to court records , they were a few miles out of town when Morales suddenly cinched his belt around Winchell 's neck and began strangling her . She fought back fiercely . The belt broke , so he pulled out the hammer and began bashing her head . <p> " She screamed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ripping her own hair out of her scalp in the struggle , " according to a state attorney general 's account . Ortega ignored her pleas and as Morales told him to keep driving he smashed her 23 times in the head , crushing the base of her neck and bloodying her arms and hands as she tried to ward off the blows . <p> By the time Ortega pulled over at the corner of Bender and Peltier roads , 7 miles outside Lodi , Winchell was unconscious and slumped against the passenger door . According to investigators , Morales hopped out of the car , and saying it was a shame to waste " a good piece of ass , " he told Ortega to leave the two of them , drive away and come back in 15 minutes . <p> Morales dragged the still-unconscious Winchell face-down across the road into a vineyard . There , in the chilly darkness , he stripped her of everything but her sweater and bra , which he pulled up to her neck . Then he flipped her onto her back and raped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the road , he plunged his knife four times into her chest to make sure she was dead . <p> Ortega picked Morales up and drove him home to Stockton . Then , investigators said , they celebrated separately : Ortega picked up Winchell 's boyfriend and had sex with him in the car , and Morales got drunk on beer and wine he bought with $11 from Winchell 's purse . <p> It did n't take long for authorities to figure out what had happened . <p> Winchell 's mother called police when her daughter did n't come back and told officers the last person the girl had talked to on the phone before leaving was Ortega . Investigators found him at home the next day , he quickly confessed , and when they burst into Morales ' Stockton apartment they found all they needed . <p> The broken belt , stained with Winchell 's blood , was under a mattress , and the blood-splattered floor mats from Ortega 's car lay in the trash . The bloody hammer was in the refrigerator vegetable crisper , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . <p> At the police station , a deputy district attorney asked Morales if he 'd like to discuss the crime . " Morales just smiled , " according to a prosecution report . " He stretched his arms into the air and yawned , and told the deputy district attorney that he had been up ' partying ' all night and was tired . " <p> Two years later , Morales was found guilty of murder with the special circumstances of lying in wait , or planning the killing in advance , and murder by torture . He was sent to Death Row . <p> Ortega received a life sentence without possibility of parole . He and Morales refused requests for interviews . <p> Winchell 's boyfriend left town soon after the murder . " I felt so badly , like her family hated me after that . I left and started a new life , " he said . " I just could n't talk to Terri 's folks again . " <p> Asked what he planned to do on the night of the execution , he let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to disappear , " he whispered . " It 's just devastating to have this come up all over again . "  --   --   --  <p> Since his sentencing in 1983 , Morales has radically changed his life , family and friends say . <p> He kicked drugs and booze and devoted himself so rigorously to his religion that 15 years ago , members and deacons of his Stockton church began regular pilgrimages to San Quentin to study the Bible with him . He was baptized several years ago in prison . <p> He has received " A " grades in English and math classes while on Death Row , and his meticulous drawings of wilderness scenes and portrait subjects are popular sellers in the prison art store . <p> " Like many people , Mike has been through difficult times with his family , but his relationship with them now is strong , and he has a valuable role among them , " Helen Keeler , a friend Morales has appointed as his spokeswoman on personal matters , wrote in an e-mail from her home in England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed by a man rendered unrecognizable to his family and friends through drug use . ... They feel this crime was not committed by the man they know and love . " <p> Morales ' mother , Josie Morales , wrote in his clemency petition  --  denied by the governor on Friday  --  that as he mellowed behind bars , " he has grown into a very loving and caring son , brother and father . " <p> For his part , Morales admits what he did and says he is sorry . But he 's still contesting the death sentence , saying the " lying in wait " charge that landed him on Death Row was corroborated chiefly by a jailhouse informant who lied when he testified that Morales had confessed to him in Spanish . Morales does n't speak Spanish , his defense attorneys say . <p> Prosecutors and Winchell 's family say the objections are baseless  --  at least two other people also corroborated the " lying in wait " charge , they say  --  and add that fighting the sentence undermines Morales ' claims of remorse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to killing my sister in his clemency letter to the governor , " Winchell 's brother Chalk said angrily , waving a copy of the three-page missive . " He does n't ever say he killed Terri  --  he says , ' I 've been found guilty . ' That does n't sound like he 's really owning up to it . " <p> As the hours tick down to execution night , Chalk and his family have begun reliving the horror of 25 years ago all over again . Chalk 's wife , Jessica , said she only recently saw him cry for the first time in their 13-year relationship . He and his brothers have all signed up to watch the execution , and they get more nervous and angry with every passing day , Chalk said . <p> Winchell 's mother , now in her 70s , speaks out as little as possible and canceled her plan to witness Morales ' death . For now , she is letting a poem she wrote for her daughter do her talking : <p> " You were such a rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence filled my life and made it sweet ... <p> But there 's a veil between us , and I can not get across , <p> and your name , unanswered , comes again to me ; <p> And I am left , amidst my tears in silence and alone , <p> with nothing left , but pain and memory ! " <p> " God only knows if this guy being put to death will make my mom , or any of us , really feel better about what happened , get that ' closure ' thing people talk about , " Chalk said . " But at least one thing will be for sure , and for that I know I will get some comfort . <p> " He 'll be gone . And that part , at least , will be over forever .
