Halo : Ghosts of Onyx By Nylund , Eric Tor Books Nylund , Eric 1647 HOURS , MAY 1 , 2531 ( MILITARY CALENDAR ) 111 TAURI SYSTEM , CAMP NEW HOPE , PLANET VICTORIA John , SPARTAN-117 , despite being encased in a half ton of angular MJOLNIR armor , moved like a shadow through the twilight forest underbrush . The guard on the perimeter of Base New Hope drew on a cigarette , took a final puff , and tossed the butt . John lunged , a whisper rustle , and he wrapped his arm around the man 's neck , wrenching it up with a pop . The guard 's cigarette hit the ground . Nearby crickets resumed their night song . John pinged his status to the rest of Blue Team . Four green LED lights winked on his display , indicating the rest of the extended perimeter guards had been neutralized . The next objective was a delivery gate , the weakest part of the rebel base 's defense system . The guardhouse had two men outside , two on the rooftop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base had impressive security even by Spartan standards : motion and seismic sensors , a triple layering of guards , trained dogs , and overhead MAKO-class drones . John blinked his status light green : the signal to proceed with the next phase . The setting sun just touched the edge of the horizon when the guards on the roof of the bunker twitched and crumpled.It happened so fast , John was n't sure which Linda had targeted first . A heartbeat later the two on the ground were dead as well . John and Kurt ran for the gatehouse . Kelly sprinted ahead , covering the three hundred meters from the forest in half the time , and leapt to the roof in a single bound . She opened the roof 's vent and dropped flash-bang grenades . Kurt posted outside the door , and swept the aft side for any targets . John waited on the other side of the steel and bulletproof-glass security door , one hand on its handle , one foot braced against the wall . Inside three muffled thumps sounded . John pulled , wrenching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . Kurt entered , his M7 submachine gun burping three-round bursts . John was in a moment later , and assessed the threats in the blink of an eye . There were three guards already down . Behind them , banks of security monitors showed a hundred views of the base . Seven other men sat at a card table , shaking off the effects of the flash-bangs . They stood with their sidearms halfway out of their holsters . John calmly shot each man , once in the head . Nothing moved . Kelly dropped outside the door , rolled inside , her weapon leveled . " Security system , " John whispered to her and Kurt . Fred and Linda appeared a moment later , and together they pulled and wedged the heavy door back into its twisted frame . " All good outside , " Fred told them . Kelly sat before the bank of monitors and pulled out a touch pad , booting the ONI computer infiltration software package . Kurt tapped on the keyboard , nodding to the sticky note under one monitor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Okay , " Kelly muttered . " We can do it the easy way , too . Running monitor-looping protocol , now . I 'll get a clean path to the target . " Kurt meanwhile flipped through various camera angles and subsystems on the displays . " No alarms raised , " he reported . He paused and watched a group of guards unloading ammunition canisters off a Warthog . One man fumbled and dropped a can ; along its side was stenciled : MUTA-AP-09334 . John had n't ordered a subsystems sweep , though he had n't specifically forbidden it , either . Kurt 's actions could trigger a red flag at the base 's command and control . John had mixed feelings about using SPARTAN-051 , Kurt , as Sam 's replacement on Blue Team . On the one hand , he was an extremely capable Spartan . Chief Mendez had routinely given him command of Green Team during training exercises , and Kurt had often won when facing John 's Blue Team . But on the other hand , he was , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Spartan , and even the non-Spartan personnel that trained and supplied them . As a professional soldier in the middle of two wars -- one fighting an entrenched rebellion , the other taking on a technologically superior xenophobic alien race -- Kurt spent a considerable amount of time and energy making friends . " Camera system and detectors looped , " Kelly announced and made a tiny circle with her index finger . " We have fifteen minutes while dogs and drones are rotated and refueled . So just guards to deal with . " " Move , " John told his team . Kurt hesitated , eyes still fixed on the monitors . " What ? " John asked . " A funny feeling , " Kurt whispered . This worried John . Everyone had performed flawlessly , and there were no signs the enemy had reacted to their presence . But Kurt had a reputation for sniffing out ambushes . John had been on the receiving end of Kurt 's intuition several times during training . John nodded at the monitor , still devoid of anything but normal activity . " Explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurt said . " They look like . . . they 're getting ready for something . Security systems and machines can be fooled -- or easily rigged to fool , " he stated . " People ? They 're not so easy . " " I understand , " John said . " We 'll stay sharp , but we have to stick to the schedule . Let 's move . " Kurt got up , casting a glance back at the monitor as they exited the gatehouse . The Spartans melted from shadow to shadow , skirting around a warehouse , under officers ' barracks , and finally , at the center of the base , they approached the edge of a warehouse . The building was surrounded by three fences posted with warnings that the gravel yard beyond was mined . Eight guards patrolled the perimeter . Parked on the side was a modified Warthog ; it had been cut in half and a new midsection had been welded in place that looked like it could carry ten men into battle . It would suffice . John withdrew a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter flickered to a hundred times normal background level for this planet . That confirmed that their primary target was inside : three FENRIS nuclear warheads . Recent battles with the Covenant had depleted UNSC stockpiles of fissile materials in this sector to almost nothing . Insurgents had heard of this ( which indicated they also had a considerable intelligence capability ) , and they had contacted the regional CENTCOM to boldly offer a trade . They said they had stolen warheads . They claimed to have people with Borren 's Syndrome , and wanted the expertise and medicines only UNSC doctors could provide . CENTCOM said they 'd consider the matter . They had considered it , and sent in Blue Team to get those warheads , and if presented with the opportunity , they were to target any rebel leaders . John signaled his team to move out , disperse around the bunker , and take up positions to snipe the guards . Green acknowledgment lights winked on . Kurt 's was last , with a palpable hesitation . John gave Kurt a short hand wave , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle ready to move . Kurt nodded . Kurt 's " feeling " that something was wrong was contagious . John did n't like it . He pushed his uncertainties aside . Blue Team was in position . John unslung his sniper rifle and sighted . He gave the " go " signal and watched as one guard and then another silently fell over . Linda had been quick and efficient as usual . John gave the go-ahead to move in . Blue Team eased inside , sweeping the dark corners of the building . The place was empty , save steel racks cradling three conical warhead casings . John 's radiation counter jumped , indicating that they did not hold conventional explosives . He pointed at Kelly and Fred , to the rack , then to the Warthog outside . They nodded . Kurt 's acknowledgment light winked red . No Spartan flashed a red light on a mission unless they had a good reason . " Abort , " John said . " Back out . Now . " Dizziness washed over him . John saw Linda , Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed him . John awoke with a start . Every muscle burned and it felt like someone had hammered his head . This was a good sign : it meant he was n't dead . He tensed his muscles against an unyielding pressure . He blinked to clear his hazy vision and saw he sat propped against a wall , still in the high-security bunker . The warheads were also still there . Then John saw a dozen commandos in the warehouse , watching him . They hefted the .30-caliber machine gun , favored by rebel forces . Nicknamed " confetti makers , " they were grossly inaccurate , but at point-blank range , it would hardly be a concern . The rest of Blue Team lay face-first on the concrete floor . Technicians in lab coats crouched over them capturing high-resolution digital video . John jerked against his inert armor . He had to get to his team . Were they dead ? " No need to struggle , " a voice said . A man with long gray hair stepped in front of John 's faceplate . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you and your comrades . UNSC standard issue for dangerous felons . " He smiled . " I 'd wager without one you could , and would , rip me in half in that miraculous power armor . " John kept his mouth shut . " Relax , " the man said . " I am General Graves . " John recognized the name . Howard Graves was one of the three men believed to be in charge of the united rebel front . It was no coincidence he was here . " You 're suffering from rapid decompression -- the bends , " he told John . " We used an antigrav plate , old technology that never panned out , but for our purposes , it worked just fine . A focused beam fooled your armor 's sensors into thinking you were in a ten-gee environment . It increased internal pressure to save your lives , momentarily rendering you unconscious . " " You engineered this all for us , " John said , his voice hoarse . " You ' Spartans ' have put quite a dent in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Station Jefferson in the Eridanus asteroid belt last year ; our destroyer Origami ; six months ago , our high-explosive manufacturing facility ; followed by the incident in Micronesia , and our saboteur cell on Reach . I did n't believe it until I saw the video . All by the same four-man team . Some said ' Blue Team ' was a myth . " He rapped his knuckle on John 's faceplate . " You seem real enough to me . " John struggled , but he might as well have been encased in a mountain of steel . The neural collar neutralized every signal traveling down his spine save the autonomics to his heart and diaphragm . He had to focus . Did everyone on his team have a collar ? Yes . Each Spartan had a thick clamp on the back of their neck , directly over the AI interface port . Graves had excellent intelligence on their equipment . Wait . John scrutinized his paralyzed team : Kelly , Linda , and Fred . No Kurt . Graves had said " four-man team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you surmised , " Graves continued , " this was all for your benefit . We scraped our fissile material together and made sure it was done so sloppily that even your Office of Naval Intelligence saw it happen . We anticipated the miraculous Blue Team would be sent . I am not disappointed that your leaders ' minds are still so easily read . " A young commando approached , saluted , and nervously whispered , " Sir , external sensors are off-line . " Graves frowned . " Drag the prisoners out of here . Sound the general alarm . Police those warheads , and tell the liftships to --  " A buzzing sound filled the air . John spied a blur of spinning metal through the doorway . He had a fraction of a second to see it was an eight-armed Asteroidea antipersonnel mine , its pressure trigger jammed with a chunk of gravel -- just before it detonated into a ball of thunder . Metal pinged off John 's armor . Everyone standing in the room doubled over from the concussive force and hail of shrapnel . Six commandos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking their heads to clear the disorientation . The modified Warthog that had been parked next to the bunker crashed into the open double doorway . The entire warehouse shook . The commandos opened fire , and rushed the doorway . The Warthog pulled away , then with a squeal , it reversed , and then rammed the doorway again . The corrugated steel walls screeched , buckled , and with a shower of sparks the vehicle wedged its midsection in the building like a pregnant queen termite . The commandos unloaded their confetti makers , puckering the ' Hog 's armor . The top of the midsection slid open and three more Asteroidea antipersonnel mines arced , whirling like a child 's toy -- each landing in a corner of the bunker -- and exploded . White-hot metal fragments cut through the commandos like a scythe . Kurt leapt out and shot the three men still moving . He quickly went to each Spartan and pulled off the collars . Kelly rolled to her feet . Fred and Linda got up . Kurt yanked the collar off John 's neck . His entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his commands . He flexed his limbs . There was no permanent nerve damage . " We can forget about stealth now , " John said . " Kurt , drive the Warthog . Kelly , Linda , Fred , get those warheads loaded ASAP . " They nodded . John went to General Graves . A sliver of corrugated steel had lodged in the man 's skull . Unfortunate . Graves had held secrets of the rebels ' command and intelligence structuresecrets John had had the barest glimpse of . Their capacities had been greatly underestimated . With the larger Covenant threat looming , John wondered what the rebels would ultimately do . Attack a weakened UNSC as it battled aliens , or fight against humanity 's common enemy ? He ignored the larger strategic picture and focused on the tactical , helping Kelly maneuver the last warhead into the Warthog 's armored midsection . Loaded with the bombs and five armored Spartans , the vehicle bottomed its shocks . John climbed into the rear and Kurt drove , and they sluggishly accelerated away from the secure warehouse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurt turned on the Warthog 's radio . It buzzed with confused chatter . " Unit One nonresponsive . Gunfire reported . Man down ! Tracking APC . Open fire ? Confirm -- confirm ! All units converge . Do it now ! " " Everyone , " John shouted , " into the center . " Holes peppered the Warthog , armor-piecing rounds penetrating the side like paper and denting the casings of the warheads . " Behind the warheads ! " Fred told them . John , Kelly , Fred , and Linda huddled behind the missiles . Nuclear warheads ironically would provide their best defense . Their casings were superhardened , both to contain radiation and hold the fury of a small sun for a split second longer and to boost the thermonuclear yield . John looked up at the driver 's seat . Kurt squeezed himself lower into the seat , presenting the smallest possible target , risking his life to get them all to safety . The Warthog billowed smoke , but its speed slowly increased to forty kilometers an hour . A sharp rattle came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then left . Kurt regained control and kept going . The AP fire slowed and then stopped . " Brace ! " Kurt said and downshifted . The Warthog barreled through the chain-link and concertina-wire barrier , over gravel fields , and into the forest . " Road 32-B to the PZ , " Kurt said . " Road " was a creative overstatement . They bounced along , mowing down trees , fishtailing , and spraying mud . " Drones ! " Kurt told them . " Get the hatch open , " John ordered . Kelly and Fred pulled the midsection roof panels apart . John stuck his head out , and spotted three MAKO-class attack drones jetting toward them , each heavy with a fat missile . One direct hit would take out the Warthog . Even a near miss could destroy an axle . Linda popped up , her sniper rifle already in hand and eyes on the scope . John and Linda opened fire . The lead drone smoked and dropped into the trees . The next drone angled up , bobbing . It released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke appeared , a tail of fire , and a missile accelerated toward them at a frightening rate . Linda fired , squeezing off the rounds as fast as the chamber could cycle . The missile started to spin . . . but it was still dead on course . " PZ three hundred meters , " Kelly said , consulting her tablet . " Welcome committee has us in their sights . " " Tell them we have the package , " John said , " and we need a hand . " " Roger that , " she said . The missile was two kilometers from them -- closing fast . Ahead , the forest turned into swamp . With a hurricane roar , a UNSC Pelican dropship rose over the treetops and its twin chain guns spat a cloud of depleted uranium slugs at the incoming missile -- making it bloom into a flower of fire and smoke . " Stand by for pickup , Blue Team , " the dropship 's pilot said over their COM . " We got incoming single-craft hostiles . So hang tight how his friend had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a breach in his suit . If a single AP round had breached their MJOLNIR , they 'd be in a similar jam . The Warthog , billowing thick black clouds , rattled to a stop . The Pelican settled over it and clamped tight . Blue Team came back all green status lights , and John relaxed ; he had been holding his breath . The Pelican lifted the Warthog , laden with Spartans and warheads , into the air . " Make secure , " the pilot said . " Bogies inbound on vector zero seven two . " Acceleration tugged at John , but he stood fast , one hand bracing the nukes , the other against the punctured side of the Warthog . The clear blue light outside darkened to black and filled with the twinkle of stars . " Rendezvous with the Bunker Hill in fifteen seconds , " the Pelican pilot announced . " Prepare for immediate out-system Slipspace jump . " Kurt carefully eased out of the driver 's seat and into the midsection to join them . " Nice work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a trap ? " " It was the guards loading ammunition off the Warthog , " Kurt explained . " I saw it at the time , but it did n't register until it was almost too late . Those ammo canisters were marked as armor-piercing rounds . All of them . You would n't need that much AP unless you were taking on a few light tanks . . . . " " Or a squad of Spartans , " Linda said , catching on . " Us , " Fred remarked . Kurt doggedly shook his head . " I should have figured it out sooner . I almost got everyone killed . " " You mean you saved everyone , " Kelly said and she butted her shoulder into his . " If you ever have another funny ' feeling , ' " John told him , " tell me , and make me understand . " Kurt nodded . John wondered about this man 's " feelings , " his instinctive subconscious awareness of the danger . CPO Mendez had made then all train so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-to-hand combat , and battlefield tactics were part of their hardwired instincts now . But that did n't mean the underlying biological impulses were worthless . Quite the opposite . John set a hand on Kurt 's shoulder , searching for the right words . Kelly , as usual , articulated the sentiments that John never could . She said , " Welcome to Blue , Spartan . We 're going to make a great team . " Continues ... by Nylund , Eric
