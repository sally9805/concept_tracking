Behind the Galleries // This book is my own store room , a personal archive , designed to explain what goes on behind the polished doors in the Natural History Museum . All our lives are collections curated through memory . We pick up recollections and facts and store them , often half forgotten , or tucked away on shelves buried deep in the psyche . Not everything is as blameless as we might like . But the sum total of that deep archive is what makes us who we are . I can not escape the fact that working for a whole lifetime within the extravagant building in South Kensington has moulded much of my character . By the same token , I also know the place rather better than any outsider . I am in a position to write a natural history of the Natural History Museum , to elucidate its human fauna and explain its ethology . There are histories that deal with the decisions of the mighty , and there are histories that are concerned with the ways of ordinary people . An admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by William T. Stearn , was published in 1981 . What Stearn largely left out was an account of the achievements , hopes and frustrations , virtues and failings of the scientists who occupied the " shop floor " - the social history , if you like . My own Dry Storeroom No. 1 will curate some of the stories of the people who go to make up a unique place . I believe profoundly in the importance of museums ; I would go as far as to say that you can judge a society by the quality of its museums . But they do not exist as collections alone . In the long term , the lustre of a museum does not depend only on the artefacts or objects it contains-the people who work out of sight are what keeps a museum alive by contributing research to make the collections active , or by applying learning and scholarship to reveal more than was known before about the stored objects . I want to bring those invisible people into the sunlight . From a thousand possible stories I will pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it into my own collection . Although I describe my particular institution I dare say it could be a proxy for any other great museum . Perhaps my investigations will even cast a little light on to the museum that makes up our own biography , our character , ourselves . // At first glance the Natural History Museum looks like some kind of cathedral , dominated by towers topped by short spires ; these lie at the centre of the building and at its eastern and western corners . Ranks of round-topped Romanesque windows lie on " aisles " connecting the towers which confirm the first impression of a sacred building . Even on a dull day the outside of the Museum shows a pleasing shade of buff , a mass of terracotta tiles , the warmth of which contrasts with the pale stucco of the terraces that line much of the other side of the Cromwell Road . Courses of blue tiles break up the solidity of the fa ? ade . The entrance to the Museum is a great rounded repeated arch , flanked by columns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of broad steps . Arriving at the Natural History Museum is rather like entering one of the magnificent cathedrals of Europe , like those at Reims , Chartres or Strasbourg . The visitor almost expects to hear the trilling of an organ , or the sudden pause of a choir in rehearsal . Instead , there is the cacophony of young voices . And where the Gothic cathedral will have a panoply of saints on the tympanum above the door , or maybe carvings of the Flight from Egypt , here instead are motifs of natural history-foliage with sheep , a wolf , a muscled kangaroo. // The main hall still retains the feel of the nave of a great Gothic cathedral , because it is so high and generously vaulted . But now the differences are obvious . High above , where the cathedral might display flying buttresses , there are great arches of steel , not modestly concealed , but rather flaunted for all they are worth . This is a display of the Victorian delight in technology , a celebration of what new engineering techniques could perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum , a steel frame is concealed beneath a covering of terracotta tiles that completely smother the surface of the outside and most of the inside of the building ; these paint the dominant pale-brown colour . Only in the hall are the bones exposed . This could have created a stark effect but is softened by painted ceiling panels ; no angels spreadeagled above , but instead wonderful stylized paintings of plants . It does not take a botanist to recognize some of them : here is a Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) , * there is a lemon tree ( Citrus limonum ) , but how many Europeans would recognize the cacao plant ( Theobroma cacao ) ? Many visitors , and most children , do n't even notice these charming ceiling paintings . Their attention is captured by other bones : the enormous Diplodocus dinosaur that occupies the centre of the ground floor , heading in osteological splendour towards the door . Its tiny head bears a mouthful of splayed teeth in a grinning welcome . // The Diplodocus has been there a long time . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was assembled in the Museum during 1905 . The great philanthropist Andrew Carnegie presented the specimen to King Edward VII , who then handed it over to the Museum in person at a grand public occasion . Diplodocus was proudly in place when I first came to the Natural History Museum as a little boy in the 1950s , and it was still there when I retired in 2006 . I am always glad to see it ; not that I regard a constructed replica of an ancient fossil as an old friend , it is just consoling to pass the time of day with something that changes little in a mutable world . // But Diplodocus has changed , albeit rather subtly . When I was a youngster , the enormously long Diplodocus tail hung down at the rear end and almost trailed along the floor , its great number of extended vertebrae supported by a series of little props . This arrangement was not popular with the warders , as unscrupulous visitors would occasionally steal the last vertebra from the end of the tail . There was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of thieves so that the full backbone was restored by the time the doors opened the following day . Visitors today will see a rather different Diplodocus : the tail is elevated like an extended whip held well above the ground , supported on a brass crutch which has been somewhat cruelly compared with those often to be found in the paintings of Salvador Dal ? ; now the massive beast has an altogether more vigorous stance . The skeleton was remodelled after research indicated that the tail had a function as a counterbalance to the extraordinarily long neck at the opposite end of the body . Far from being a laggard , Diplodocus was an active animal , despite the smallness of its brain . Nowadays , all the huge sauropod dinosaurs in films such as Jurassic Park show the tail in this active position . Many exhibits in a natural history museum are not permanent in the way that sculptures or portraits are in an art gallery . Bones can be rehung in a more literal way than paintings . // Now animatronic dinosaurs flash their teeth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , a hundred million years ago . Small children shelter nervously behind the legs of their parents . " Do n't worry , " say the parents , " they are n't real . " The kids do not always look convinced . The bones that caused such a sensation in Andrew Carnegie 's time a century ago , and that still command attention in the main hall , are now sometimes considered a little too tame . There is , to my mind , still something eloquent about the Diplodocus specimen : not merely its size , but that it is the assembled evidence for part of a vanished world . All those glamorous animations and movie adventures rely ultimately on the bones . A museum is a place where the visitor can come to examine evidence , as well as to be diverted . Before the exhibitions started to tell stories , that was one of the main functions of a museum , and the evidence was laid out in ranks . There are still galleries in the Natural History Museum displaying minerals , the objects themselves- unadorned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved in aspic from the days of such systematic rather than thematic exhibits . Few people now find their way to these galleries . // The public galleries take up much less than half of the space of the Natural History Museum . Tucked away , mostly out of view , there is a warren of corridors , obsolete galleries , offices , libraries and above all , collections . This is the natural habitat of the curator . It is where I have spent a large part of my life-indeed , the Natural History Museum provides a way of life as distinctive as that of a monastery . Most people in the world at large know very little about this unique habitat . This is the world I shall reveal . // I had been a natural historian for as long as I could remember and I had always wanted to work in a museum . When there was a " career day " at my school in west London I was foolish enough to ask the careers master , " How do you get into a museum ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Through the front door ! " But I soon learned that it would not be that easy . Getting " into a museum " as a researcher or curator is a rather arduous business . A first degree must be taken in an appropriate subject , geology in my case , and this in turn followed by a Ph.D . in a speciality close to the area of research in the museum . When I applied for my job in 1970 , this was enough , but today the demands are even greater . A researcher must have a " track record , " which is a euphemism for lots of published scientific papers-that is , articles on research printed in prestigious scientific journals . He or she must also be described in glowing terms by any number of referees ; and , most difficult of all , there must be the prospect of raising funds from the rather small number of public bodies that pay out for research . It is a tall order . Even so , the most important qualification remains what it always was : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other job quite like it . // The interview for my job was conducted in the Board Room . It was 1970 . To reach the rather stern room on the first floor of the Natural History Museum I had passed through several sets of impressive mahogany doors . A large and very polished table was in the middle of the room , the kind of table that is always associated with admonishment . On one wall there was and still is a splendid portrait of the first Director of the Museum , the famous anatomist Sir Richard Owen , by Holman Hunt . He was an old man when he sat for the portrait , and is dressed in a brilliant scarlet robe , beautifully painted to show the glint of satin , indicative of some very superior doctorate . His glittering eyes survey the room , intent on not tolerating fools gladly . Each candidate was interviewed by the Keeper of Palaeontology- who was the head of the appropriate department-and his Deputy Keeper , together with the Museum Secretary , Mr. Coleman . The Secretary was a rather grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the museum from the administrative side . There was also a sleepy-looking gentleman from the Civil Service Commission , who was there for some arcane purpose connected with the fact that the successful candidate would be paid out of the public purse . I was dressed in my best , and indeed only , suit and very nervous . // I was applying to be the " trilobite man " for the Museum . The previous occupant of the post was Bill Dean , who had gone off to join the Geological Survey of Canada . He left behind a formidable reputation . Trilobites are one of the largest and most varied groups of extinct animals , and being paid to study them is one of the greatest privileges in palaeontology . I had not yet completed my Ph.D . thesis , and was young and inexperienced . My fellow candidates were ahead of me by a few months or years . We would all get to know one another well over the course of our professional lives , but for the moment conversation was restricted to twitchy pleasantries . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaited our turn in the Board Room . Eventually , I had to go in to face the piercing eyes of Sir Richard . The questioning began . Fortunately , I had made some interesting discoveries in the Arctic island of Spitsbergen where I had been carrying out my Ph.D . research at Cambridge University , so once I got going I had a lot to talk about , and my general air of nervousness began to subside . I had discovered all kinds of new trilobites in the Ordovician* age rocks there , and studying these animals seemed a matter of pressing excitement . Youthful enthusiasm can occasionally count for more than mature wisdom . The man from the Civil Service Commission stirred himself once and asked if I played any sport . The answer was no , except for tiddlywinks . He then sank back into apparent torpor . The Keeper smiled at me benignly . Hands were shaken , and it was all over . Did I imagine something less severe in Sir Richard Owen 's expression as I left the Board Room ? // Several weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth I was taken on as a Junior Research Fellow , which meant , I think , that if I did not work out I could be politely escorted out of the cathedral . But important to me was that I was entitled to go behind the mahogany doors into the secret world of the collections , and to receive a modest salary for doing so . I was being paid to do work that I would have done for nothing . I had a season ticket to a world of wonders . // To trace my journey behind the scenes , follow me along one of the few galleries remaining from the old days of the Museum , one flanked by a high wall lined with cases bearing the fossils of ancient marine reptiles : ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs . They look as if they are swimming along this wall , one above the other , making a kind of Jurassic dolphin pod ( although of course they are not biologically related to those similar-looking living mammals ) . They comprise a famous collection , including some specimens that are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ichthyosaurs probably died in the process of giving birth to live young , although few visitors notice the label explaining this curious and fascinating fact . //
