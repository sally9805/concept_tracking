To say Chris Ware lives in the past is like saying the Queen of England lives in a house . Ware turns the past into a palace . In 2000 's Jimmy Corrigan : The Smartest Kid on Earth , Ware ransacks the history of cartooning , borrowing from 19th century lithography , superhero comics and Sunday funnies to create a visual language in which panels twist across the page like a drunken conga line . <P> Quimby the Mouse ( Fantagraphics ; 68 pages ) collects a series of comics from the early 1990s in which Corrigan 's style and themes were formed . The alienated title rodent shares DNA with Disney 's Mickey , among others , but with surreal differences ( in some strips , for instance , he has two heads , one of which sickens and dies ) . Recapturing the past is a theme here too : Ware writes a touching introduction about the death of his grandmother , details from which  --  his returning to visit her former home , for example  --  surface in the strips . Ware 's eerie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magic kingdom nonetheless .  --  By James Poniewozik
