China and India trained more than 480,000 engineers in 2003 . Is there no limit to the number of American jobs that will move there ? Actually , there is . The McKinsey Global Institute , research arm of the consulting firm , spent a year trying to find the " theoretical maximum " number of jobs that could move offshore from the U.S. and Europe .
