Digital cameras are educational tools that support purposeful instruction with a clear vision on curriculum , instruction , assessment , and reflection . This article explains the impact of digital cameras in today 's classrooms , indicates effective usage of digital cameras , and relates how multidimensional learning can be provided for students by using digital cameras . <p> As classrooms continue to be infused with various forms of technology , teachers need to recognize the role digital cameras play in student performance and the multiple dimensions this instructional tool does to enrich learning . According to Education World ( 2005 , p. 1 ) , " teachers across the country and around the world are discovering the many valuable uses for digital cameras ; uses that both engage students and make their own professional lives easier . " Further , " students embrace the creativity and assessment opportunities that digital photos offer " ( Lindroth , 2004 , p. 22 ) . Therefore , it is astute of teachers to maximize and have digital cameras integrated in the classrooms for students to increase their learning and achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of digital cameras in today 's classrooms , ( 2 ) indicates effective usage of digital cameras , and ( 3 ) relates how multidimensional learning can be provided for students by using digital cameras . <p> Impact of Digital Cameras <p> As stated by Rivard ( 2004 , p. 55 ) " digital cameras have become the hottest tech trend in K-12 districts today . " This is attributed to students being more visual because of their familiarity with video games , computers , and movies . <p> Since individuals are " intensely visual " ( Wolfe , 2001 , p. 152 ) , the researcher notes that more details and data are obtained visually than any of the other senses . In essence , she emphasizes " a picture is worth at least 10,000 words " ( p. 152 ) . This is of particular importance since usage of images is more prevalent in our society . Teachers need to adapt their instructional methods to enhance the visual literacy abilities of students while enabling learners to develop higher level thinking processes ( Cooper , 2003 ; Wilhelm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 ) explain that visual literacy skills will have even greater demands for students entering the workforce as modem society advances . Then , from an instructional stance , digital cameras have value and do have a positive impact on learning . <p> Effective Usage of Digital Cameras <p> Consider the usage of digital cameras to determine the extent of how the usage is aligned with the curriculum , one 's teaching , and the classroom assessments . This consideration is important because of the recent emphasis on curriculum and state mandated tests . It is suggested that judgments be made about how well the digital camera usage matches these areas . It is recommended that digital usage match well with these areas because a strong alignment yields noted results . <p> Another consideration is that teachers abide by school district policy and make certain the available documentation is in place before allowing individuals to be photographed . Further , teachers should stress the importance of taking appropriate images . Establishing guidelines with students ' input assists them in being selective about their photographs . <p> Rairigh and Kirby ( 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( a ) providing the instructional tasks for the students ' engagement , ( b ) providing an understanding and knowledge base for the use of digital cameras , ( c ) providing access and instructions to students for the handling and use of this technology , and ( d ) providing instruction and guidelines for using this technology to provide feedback . <p> Thus , it is critical that planning and time be spent discussing the basic photography guidelines . In regards to effective usage of digital photos , teachers and students must learn to be deliberate and resourceful when it comes to printing and using the images produced . <p> Multidimensional Learning <p> Multidimensional learning " integrates different memory strategies to facilitate the learning process and is heavily dependent on illustrations and graphics " ( Abdelhamid , 2005 , p. 1 ) . This cognitive , psychology-based model is used in conjunction with technology-assisted instruction and requires students to integrate memory strategies while generating the information . Hence , digital cameras provide the illustrations and graphics to promote concept attainment and to stimulate the memory strategies . Regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching tool that supports the curriculum across all content areas . <p> It has been noted that digital imaging motivates students to write ( Rivard , 2004 ) . Knowing that digital photographs encourage students to want to write , students of all ages should be given the opportunities . When provided opportunities to write , students learn to develop his or her writing style . When students are encouraged to develop their own style , they are able to apply the process to other writing tasks . This motivates them to write for themselves  --  promoting enjoyment of writing throughout their lives . Further , writing is important because it allows students to organize their thought processes while increasing their vocabulary . Writing is imperative for students to learn , enhance , and apply in the K-12 classrooms . Digital camera usage encourages students to write . <p> It is particularly noteworthy that when students take the photographs , ownership is promoted . When students see the photographs they took , concepts are clarified and attained . While doing her student teaching , Kerri Peloso had second grade students at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of objects in the classroom . <p> They used their pictures to create writing pieces that were showcased in the room . A compilation of the pictures was made and this became a classroom book that was checked out by students to take home to develop/increase their literacy skills of reading , writing , speaking , listening , and spelling . <p> Digital camera usage increases analytical skills and can be used as a means of assessing student performance . Having students know what high quality performance is can effectively be documented through photographs . When students recognize similarities and differences of their performance through photos , students become more reflective and effective with self-assessment . This process increases better performance . <p> Conclusion <p> It is recognized that digital cameras have a definite impact in today 's classrooms . With effective usage , multidimensional learning opportunities occur for students . <p> Evelyn Woldman of the Massachusetts Elementary School Principal Association emphatically states , " I think the only obstacle to using a digital camera is not having it " ( Rivard , 2004 , p. 56 ) . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking photographs . Digital cameras must be used as an educational tool that supports purposeful and meaningful instruction with a clear vision on curriculum , instruction , assessment , and reflection . <p>
