I 'M SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD and lying like a pathetic , helpless lump in the backseat of our family car , being transported to a place that treats crazy people . // This is an exceptional event , even for me . I know that my brain causes unusual problems that no one has been able to treat , but being insane is n't one of them . // How and why I 've gotten to this point is complicated , but the main reason I 'm here is more immediate . I 've finally found the one thing that brings me peace - alcohol . // Now this self-medication has become a life- threatening danger that I can not fix by myself . The doctors at the place I 'm going to promise they can help me . I 've heard that one before . // After about an hour , we arrive at a large brick building with a sign that reads DRESSLER PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL . In a split second the reality of what 's happening becomes very real and very scary . // " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backseat , my heart suddenly pounding . // " Do n't worry about the sign , " my mother says to calm my rising panic . " They treat all different kinds of problems here , Cory. " // Dad looks as worried as I am but says softly , " Let 's not deal with this now , okay ? " // Not deal with going to a hospital for psychos ? Sure , no problem . What can my father be thinking ? // Inside the main entrance , I enter a very crowded , somewhat noisy waiting room . Being on view always makes me uneasy , so as soon as I start to walk , my feet need to perform a triple hop , three quick steps only inches apart , which throws me off balance . // I have to do this in order to satisfy a tension that is building up in my legs and ca n't be released any other way . Sometimes this trips me up so much that I go flying to the ground . // I do the triple hop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the empty waiting- room chairs . // Welcome to my fun house , folks . // Chapter Two MANY OF THE PEOPLE in the waiting area are still staring at me as my right hand shoots up in the air with the middle finger extended . Oh boy , here we go , I think . Giving people the bird is another one of my involuntary movements , or tics , that pop up exactly when they should n't . Try telling people that one 's not deliberate . // Another middle-finger salute . Hi , everybody ! // For a moment I think about the new medicines I 'm taking , which are , as usual , not doing their job . Wellbutrin for depression , Tenex to keep me calm , Topamax as an " experiment " to see if a seizure medicine will help . So far I 've been on fifty or sixty different medicines , none of which have worked - and a few of them can become deadly when washed down with Jack Daniel's. // Psychiatric hospital . A place for insane people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not insane , even though the things I do make me look that way . But I do have a fear that I can think myself insane , and being in this place could push me over the edge . Going insane is probably my worst fear . If it happens , I wo n't know what , or where , reality is . To me , that 's the ultimate isolation - to be separated from my own mind . // Eventually a receptionist calls my name and then starts asking me strange , bewildering questions . One of my eyes begins to twitch rapidly , and my tongue jumps out of my mouth like a snake's. // Occasionally I make a loud grunting sound like I 've been punched hard in the stomach . Often my tics come one at a time , but today they 're arriving in clusters of three or four , probably due to the stress . // I once told my parents that they could n't live through a single day with what I go through every day of my life , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . // It takes another hour or so for my parents to be interviewed by a doctor . When they come out , I can see that my mother has been crying . My father looks exhausted and edgy. // When it 's my turn with the doctor , I ca n't stop myself from shooting him the bird , too . The guy is good about it . He totally ignores it . He 's young and gentle and pretty much puts me at ease . // " I drink more than I should at night , " I tell him , skipping the part about almost burning down my parents ' house when I passed out on the couch with a lit cigarette . " I guess I like to get a little tipsy . " // This is the understatement of the year . Tipsy is my code word for totally wasted . // The doctor gives me a complete physical , and when it 's over he says I 'm as healthy as anyone he 's seen , which strikes me as very funny . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I joke , punctuated by an involuntary tongue thrust . // " Yeah , right . " // Later , back in the waiting area , a male attendant approaches us and asks for any medicines we might have brought . // " What do you mean ? " my father asks . // " He needs these , " my mother cautions , taking out a large plastic bag crammed with pill bottles . // " The doctors will take care of that , " the attendant answers . // Mom reluctantly turns over the stash . // A while later , a female nurse approaches and leads the three of us deep into the rear of the building . // Everything is a lot different here . It 's darker and there are n't any people around . It 's a spooky place . // I fight off a really bad feeling that I 'm going somewhere I wo n't be able to handle . // Eventually we stop in front of a massive door with a sign that says JUVENILE PSYCHIATRIC WARD D. // Mental kids , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I snap , pointing to the sign . " Mom , you know I 'm not crazy . " // The nurse says , " We get all kinds of people here , " as though arriving at an insane asylum is an ordinary event in anybody 's life . // " You 're here for your drinking , " Mom adds , " which they treat . " // " It does n't say that on the signs . " // The nurse takes a large metal key out of her jacket pocket , and I freeze at the sight of it . I 've never been in a hospital where the doors have to be locked . I come to a sudden realization : You do n't lock doors to keep people out . You lock doors to keep them in. // ( Continues ... ) //
