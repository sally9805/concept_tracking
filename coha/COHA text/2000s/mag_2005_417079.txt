The siege of Tyre demonstrated that Alexander the Great was not only a master of maneuver but also a genius at siegecraft. // Above : An idealized portrait-relief of Alexander III , King of Macedon , by Londolin Orhmacht . Right : At the climax of his siege of Tyre , Alexander and his forces overrun the city 's defenses from ships and over the moles he had built in the harbor , in an illustration from the 15th-century French History of Alexander the Great . // Alexander the Great 's 13-year campaign of conquest demonstrated that he was not only a brilliant strategist and tactician who won every battle he fought but , equally important , a master of siegecraft who took every city he invested . His organizational ability , ingenuity and tactical skill as a director of siege operations were unparalleled in ancient history , and he is regarded today as perhaps the greatest master of siege warfare until the age of gunpowder weapons more than 1,000 years after his death . Before Alexander , siege warfare had progressed very little in the 800 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fortifications were virtually impregnable . Because there was no procedure for conducting a siege , few were undertaken . Even on the rare occasions when a siege was successfully mounted , the attackers usually had to rely on surprise , treachery or more commonly a lengthy blockade . During the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC , commanders made improvements in both siege and countersiege techniques , though the advantage still lay with the besieged , and the prospect of taking a fortified city by storm still presented enormous difficulties . During his brief reign from 336 to 323 BC , Alexander conducted more than 20 sieges . His methods for assaulting fortifications , which included elaborately defended walled cities , desert fortresses and mountain strongholds , never failed . Alexanders most spectacular success in this particular brand of combat was the grueling siege of the island fortress of Tyre . Undertaken during the third year of his reign , when he was 23 years old , the siege proved to be the longest and perhaps most arduous military operation of his career .

In spite of his battlefield victories over Persian armies at the Battles of Granicus in 334 and Issus in 333 , Alexander needed to take the fortified coastal cities that could be supported by the powerful Persian fleet if he was to secure Asia Minor and proceed into the hinterland of the Persian empire . Lacking adequate sea power to defeat the fleet , he decided on a novel approach-to advance along the seacoast from Asia Minor to Egypt and capture every port along the way , thereby depriving Persia of its naval bases one by one . That strategy assured the Persian navy 's surrender , since a classical-era fleet was helpless without ports at which to dock for supplies and repairs . Alexander 's resounding victory at the Granicus River went far in achieving this objective ; after the triumph nearly all the coastal cities of western Asia Minor surrendered .

At Gordium he combined forces with Parmenion , his second-in-command , and the soldiers who had been on leave rejoined the army , along with more than 3,500 new recruits . In the fall of 333 BC , Alexander turned his attention to his next objective , the Syrian coast . The Phoenician ports of Syria-located along what roughly corresponds to the coasts of modern Syria , Lebanon and Israel-harbored the best ships and crews of the Persian fleet , and their capture would effectively break Persian sea power . Meanwhile , the Persian Grand Army of King Darius III was advancing to meet Alexander in battle on the Syrian coastal plain . At Issus Alexander was victorious in his second pitched battle against the Persians , although Darius and the remnants of his force made good their escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time spent pursuing Darius through Asia , an endeavor that would likely be long and difficult , would give the Persian fleet time to undermine his position in Asia Minor and Greece , thereby forcing him to withdraw . Without attempting to pursue Darius , Alexander marched south along the coast toward the Phoenician ports , thus adhering to his strategic aim-to eliminate his enemy 's naval power and win command of the sea . Except for Tyre , the Phoenician seaports surrendered without Alexanders having to strike a blow . Tyre was the most important city in Phoenicia and one of the great maritime powers of the ancient world , with established colonies throughout the Mediterranean . The city was located on a narrow , rocky , mile-long island about a half-mile from shore . The wind-swept sea channel that separated the mainland from Tyre was shallow at first but rapidly deepened , reaching a depth of nearly 20 feet near the island . // Right : At the climax of his siege of Tyre , Alexander and his forces overrun the city 's defenses from ships and over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration from the 15th-century French History of Alexander the Great . // The island-city had two well-protected harbors : the Sidonian to the north and the Egyptian to the south . Both had interior basins and narrow , easily defended entrances . Tyre 's formidable navy of 80 warships was divided into two sections , one in each harbor , and consisted of triremes , quadriremes and quinqueremes-the most modern warships of the period , equipped with five oar banks and capable of carrying 120 soldiers and 300 oarsmen . // Above : A stone relief of one of the merchant ships that brought wealth-and power-to Phoenicia .

Since the 9th century BC , when Tyre is known to have been fortified , no conqueror had ever been able to capture the fortress , even though it had been subjected to several major sieges by some of the greatest military powers of the time . Among them were two sieges by Assyrian armies from Mesopotamia , one lasting four years ( 701-697 BC ) and another nine years ( 671-662 BC ) . The most notable attempt , however , had been that of the mighty Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II , who for 13 consecutive years ( 585-573 BC ) attempted to subdue the city . In addition to a 500-year history of successfully defending their island-city , the Tyrians had a proud heritage dating back to the 28th century BC . The population at the time of the siege was approximately 40,000 , including a strong garrison of more than 10,000 troops , and the inhabitants lived in small , tightly packed houses several stories high that covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexanders Macedonian troops and as well-equipped with arms , catapults and other materiel . Furthermore , the Tyrians had the resources to forge new weapons and construct more siege artillery if needed . Rainwater-filled cisterns and fresh water from an abundant spring meant that there was plenty of drinking water on the island . It was stockpiled with ample provisions to sustain a prolonged siege . Although virtually independent of the mainland for provisions , the city could , if necessary , receive supplies by sea . // Left : Joining two ships under a platform , Alexander 's engineers turned them into floating siege engines during the storming of Tyre . // Even though the other Phoenician seaport cities had already surrendered to Alexander , the Tyrians had no intention of handing over their city without a fight . The Tyrians had three advantages : First , Alexander had no ships of his own to use against them , thereby giving the Tyrian fleet complete command of the sea ; second , ambassadors visiting from Carthage , a colony of Tyre , promised swift aid from their powerful Punic fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tyrians knew that the local mainland resources were clearly inadequate to supply the Macedonian army with water and grain , thereby presenting Alexander with a tremendous logistical problem . Regardless of the overwhelming odds against his success , Alexander was determined not to take the Persian empire without first capturing the Persians ' greatest Mediterranean port . If he failed , the recently captured coastal cities of Asia Minor and Phoenicia could possibly be encouraged to overthrow their Macedonian garrisons , thereby seriously jeopardizing Alexander 's logistic support and lines of communications . But if he succeeded , the capture of Tyre would likely lead to the fall of Syria and Egypt and the end of Persian naval power . According to Arrian , a 2nd-century AD Greek historian whose account of the siege of Tyre is generally accepted as the most comprehensive and reliable , Alexander explained to his officers , perhaps on the eve of the siege , why Tyre could not be left in the rear of his advancing army : // Left : It took seven months for Alexander to breach Tyre 's defenses . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a second approach finally succeeded . Above : A 4th-century coin shows a war galley with ram bow before the walls of Sidon , the captured port from which Alexander launched his own flotilla against Tyre . // My friends and allies , so long as Persia is supreme at sea I am aware that we can not march in safety to Egypt . Nor , again , is it safe to pursue Darius , leaving in our rear the city of Tyre itself with its allegiance doubtful and Egypt and Cyprus still in Persia 's hands , especially in view of the state of Greek affairs ; the Persians might again secure control of the coastal places , when we have advanced in full force against Babylon and Darius , and with a larger expedition transfer the war to Greece .... But with Tyre once destroyed , Phoenicia would all be in our hands , and the best and strongest part of the Persian navy , the Phoenicians , would probably come over to us . For if their cities are in our hands neither rowers nor marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others .... Then if we keep the sea with our Macedonian ships , and the Phoenician .. . we should hold the sea-power securely , and our expedition to Egypt would be easy on the very same account . But once we have brought Egypt over , we shall have no cause of uneasiness for Greece and our home , and we shall make the expedition to Babylon , with safety at home as well as enhanced prestige , with the whole sea and all the country this side of the Euphrates cut off from Persia . To capture a fortress as strong as Tyre would require a combination of Alexanders leadership and the skill of his engineers , who would have to build siege weapons superior to any that had previously been used . In January 332 BC , the Macedonian army-approximately 30,000 men-camped on the mainland opposite the island-city and began the colossal operation . With no fleet at hand , Alexander 's only means of attack was to construct an immense 200-foot-wide mole , or causeway , to the island at the channel 's narrowest point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad causeway , upon which he would set up his towers and battering rams . The Macedonian commander pressed into service the bulk of his army and drafted thousands of workers from the surrounding countryside to supply the labor force . The uninhabited mainland city of Old Tyre , opposite the island and partly in ruins , was dismantled to provide the large quantity of stones needed , while a nearby forest supplied wood for siege works , posts and support braces . Within a few days the work was begun by driving a double line of posts into the ocean floor , bracing them with supports and filling in the space between the posts with stones , earth and wood . At first progress was rapid , as the water near the mainland was shallow and the Tyrians , across the channel a half-mile away , could do little to impede the work . Alexander actively supervised and praised the workers , who labored day and night . The difficulty and danger , however , increased very rapidly as the causeway approached the middle of the strait . The wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong currents and the workmen 's advance to within artillery range of the towering city wall made the undertaking much more dangerous . Furthermore , Tyrian ships manned with archers , slingcrs and light catapults were now able to row along the head of the causeway and attack the unprotected workers . Under this hail of missiles delivered from the city 's wall and ships , work ground to a hall . // In another illustration from History of Alexander the Great , the Macedonian king dispatches heralds to urge Tyre to surrender , only to see them killed and their bodies flung into the harbor , denying them the traditional Greek burial rites . The Tyrians did the same with any prisoners they took , and Alexander would exact grim retribution when he finally took the city . // In another illustration from History of Alexander the Great , the Macedonian king dispatches heralds to urge Tyre to surrender , only to see them killed and their bodies flung into the harbor , denying them the traditional Greek burial rites . The Tyrians did the same with any prisoners they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally took the city . // To protect the workmen , Alexander had heavy wooden barricades raised on both sides of the causeway and two lofty towers erected and moved up to the head of the mole . These multistoricd wooden structures were covered with raw animal hides to protect them and their occupants from flaming bolts and arrows . Mounted within the towers were large arrow-firing tension catapults and , in what is believed to be their first known use in battle , the considerably more powerful and accurate stone-throwing torsion or spring-powered catapults ( kalapeltes andpetrobolos ) . The weapons on the towers ' upper stories kept up a steady barrage against the defenders on the battlements , while those on the lower stories held enemy warships at bay . Alexander 's determination to take the city alarmed the Tyrians , who evacuated some of their women and children to Carthage , reinforced the wall opposite the causeway and strengthened the landward defenses with additional artillery . Also realizing the necessity of destroying the Macedonian towers , the Tyrians resorted to the ingenious idea of converting a large horse-transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat with as much dry wood as possible and then added large quantities of sulfur , oil and other flammable material . Cauldrons filled with fuel were hung from two masts , which leaned out ahead of the ship . The stern of the ship was weighted with stones and sand so that the prow was elevated and better able to be pulled onto the causeway and close to the towers . Choosing a day when a favorable wind blew , two Tyrian triremes towed the fire ship out of the Sidonian Harbor , set it ablaze and ran it high onto the causeway . While the vessel burned feverishly , the fuel from the two cauldrons spread , caught fire and engulfed the towers . With the fire raging , the two triremes lurked along each side of the causeway firing arrows at anyone trying to extinguish the blaze . At the same time , Tyrian soldiers aboard other ships landed all along the causeway , captured some Macedonian soldiers and destroyed or burned everything that had not already caught fire . The attack was so successful that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that held the causeway together were either destroyed or badly damaged by fire . With the support structure weakened , powerful waves from a subsequent storm cracked and swept away the outer section of the causeway , causing considerable overall damage . Thus , within a few hours , months of work was destroyed , according to historian Jacob Abbott , " while the army of Alexander looked on from the shore witnessing its ravages in dismay . " With the capture of Tyre vital to his strategy and prestige , Alexander gave orders for the work to be renewed . Mindful that the waves flowed northeasterly , Alexander 's engineers began work on a new mole . The old causeway had been built in a direct east-west line across the channel , and the heavy seas had consequently struck the mole 's entire south side , thus weakening the structure . The new causeway was started to the north of the failed mole and was constructed on a southwest angle so that the front of the structure ( instead of one entire side ) would bear the brunt of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mole . The new structure was also made wider and stronger so it could support even larger towers . In addition , Alexander gave orders for the construction of new siege artillery to replace what had been destroyed . By now it was clear to Alexander that it would take more than a land assault to capture the city . Consequently , while the building and repair work was being done , Alexander and a strong military escort returned to the Phoenician city of Sidon , which was a short distance north of Tyre , to organize their own fleet . Meanwhile , the situation elsewhere had changed in Alexanders favor . Aegean cities had received word of Alexanders crushing victory at Issus , as well as the news that the cities of many naval contingents that made up the Persian fleet had surrendered to the Macedonians . Consequently , many squadrons withdrew from the Persian fleet and began to return home . Warships , mainly from Cyprus and Phoenicia along with others from Lycia , Cilicia and Rhodes-many of whom had a long-standing commercial rivalry with Tyre or simply wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander . By late spring , to oppose the 80-ship Tyrian fleet , Alexander had gathered more than 220 ships-from large transports to quinqueremes-whose crews were now recognized as allies regardless of their past opposition . Once the ships were outfitted , Alexander set sail from Sidon . His fleet arrived off Tyre in battle formation , surprising and discouraging the island 's occupants . seeing that their ships were heavily outnumbered , the Tyrians blocked the mouth of both harbors with triremes set closely side by side , thereby forming a defensive boom . Alexander decided that an immediate attack at these heavily defended entrances would be too costly and chose instead to blockade both harbors. he divided his fleet into two divisions , with the Cypriot-Macedonian ships blockading the Sidonian Harbor to the north of the causeway and the Phoenician-Macedonian ships blockading the Egyptian Harbor to the south . With little to fear from enemy vessels , work on the causeway could now proceed much faster , despite the increasing depth of the channel . By early summer , as the causeway drew closer to the city , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to assist Tyre because of an ongoing war with Sicily . The Tyrians now realized the desperation of their situation and redoubled their efforts to repel the Macedonians . In addition to constantly bombarding the besiegers with stones , darts , arrows and missiles of every description , the Tyrians filled huge cauldrons with sand , heated them until the sand was scorching hot and then hurled the vessels down on the Macedonians , " thereby enveloping them in a fiery cloud which choked , blinded and scorched them almost as effectively as modern gas , " according to historian Arthur Wiegal . To counter the huge enemy siege towers being built on the causeway just out of missile range , the Tyrians heightened their wall by adding wooden towers equipped with catapults and other engines of war . From their elevated position , the Tyrian artillery had a greater range and fired burning projectiles toward Alexanders towers and at the ships that came within range . Too canny a besieger to confine his assault to this one narrow area , Alexander ordered his engineers to prepare ships to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack the Tyrian wall from the sea . Pairs of these ships were tied side by side to form stable surfaces that could support great weight . They were then decked over to create a firm platform , strongly roofed , made as fireproof as possible , and mounted with heavy catapults , powerful winches , or great metal-weighted rams. // The interior framework and apparatus of one of the two siege towers that Alexander 's engineers devised , with gangways to allow his soldiers to storm Tyre 's battlements . The basic design would see much use during medieval European sieges , but Alexander 's towers were reportedly 150 feet tall . // The catapult vessels circled the wall during the day , hurling huge stones of up to 50 pounds at the wall and into the city to harass the garrison and terrify the civilian population . The shipborne siege engines , however , could not approach close to the wall . Not only was the Tyrian missile fire intense , but huge rocks at the base of the wall , exposed by natural erosion or thrown down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sending vessels mounted with strong windlasses to remove the obstacles . Once the vessels were anchored near the rocks , Macedonian swimmers , under the protection of shipborne catapults and archers , connected lines from the winch ships to the rocks so they could be hauled out to the open sea . The Tyrians accordingly attacked the winch ships with triremes plated with armor to protect them from arrows and catapult projectiles . Alexander countered with ships similarly armored , but the defenders still found a way to undermine the operation . Tyrian divers swam out and cut the winch ships ' anchor ropes . The Macedonians again countered by replacing the ropes with iron chains , and slowly the work continued . Finally , with great labor and loss of time , the rocks were removed one by one along various channels near the causeway , permitting ram ships to be brought up to test the wall while catapults and archers provided covering fire . Once firmly anchored , these ships began hammering at the solid stone wall-the only known time in history when shipborne battering rams have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve the pressure on the mainland wall and regain their naval superiority , the Tyrians sought an opportunity to challenge the blockading fleet at sea . They knew that Alexanders united fleet was too strong to confront outright , but the defenders soon realized that the Macedonian causeway , ironically , provided them with an opportunity . With Alexander s fleet divided between the two harbors at the ends of the city , and with the nearly completed causeway blocking the shortest sea route between the harbors , the Tyrians realized that neither contingent would be able to move directly to the other 's support . They believed that they would have enough time to attack one of Alexanders naval contingents before the other could row more than two miles around the island to join the battle . The Tyrians elected to attack the Cypriot contingent in the north and determined that their best chance for a major victory at sea was to strike at midday , when many of the enemy sailors were ashore collecting provisions and when Alexander himself typically returned to his headquarters on the mainland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seven triremes and manned each ship with their most skilled oarsmen and marines . At noon on the day chosen for the sortie , the Tyrian ships rowed quietly out of the Sidonian Harbor unobserved and attacked many of the moored and partly manned Cypriot ships , causing considerable damage . With the success of the first onslaught , the sea battle moved nearer to the shore , where Cypriot crews that had quickly returned to their ships were struggling to get their vessels into fighting order . On this day , Alexander had returned to his station with the Phoenician fleet , on the southern side of the causeway , earlier than usual . When the alarm of the Tyrian sortie was given , Alexander immediately ordered the rest of his fleet into action . Leaving the main body of his ships to closely guard the entrance to the Egyptian Harbor and prevent a sortie from that quarter , Alexander led two quinqueremes and five triremes out to sea , ordering others to follow as fast as they could be manned . seeing that this quick counterattack was underway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading it , Tyrian lookouts on the wall tried to warn their fleet , but the noise and confusion were such that their signals were never seen or heard . When Alexander rounded the island he caught the Tyrian ships completely by surprise . Once they saw the enemy ships bearing down on them , the Tyrians tried to turn about and regain their harbor . After a brief sea battle , however , only a few ships were able to escape ; the greater number were sunk or captured . Their crews mostly escaped by swimming . Thereafter , Alexander enforced a vigilant blockade , and the Tyrian ships remained in both harbors . In the meantime , the causeway crept ever nearer until finally it reached the wall of Tyre . Alexanders most powerful battering rams were then brought into service along more than 200 feet of the landward walls face . The massive wall was so solid and strongly defended , however , that it defied all methods of assault from land and sea . The ram ships were now shifted to the seaward side near both harbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall was not as well fortified and defended . Once the rocks and boulders that obstructed the shipborne rams had been cleared away , the wall near the Sidonian Harbor proved to be equally invulnerable . Alexander next turned south and directed his effort near the Egyptian Harbor . // The Macedonians batter the seaport 's walls while their king and his infantry stand by to rush the breach and close for the final kill , in Alexander the Great Outside Tyre , by Hugo Vogel . // With the siege now entering its seventh month and the Tyrian wall still intact , the Macedonian army undoubtedly must have wondered whether Alexander would abandon the operation and move on to Egypt . The loss of men , materials and time had been enormous as the besiegers contended month after month with the stubborn and resourceful Tyrian defense and unfavorable wind and weather , which destroyed a great deal of their work . Each day 's delay also gave Persian King Darius time to gather forces from throughout his enormous empire for another direct confrontation with the Macedonians . Alexander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern wall . Finally , the ram ships succeeded in breaking down a portion of the wall near the Egyptian Harbor . The Macedonians made an initial assault there , but the breach was not wide enough , and the attack was too small in scale . Despite that setback , Alexander was encouraged that he at last had found a weak spot in Tyre 's defenses and decided to make another attack once the breach was enlarged . He was keenly aware that for his next attack to succeed he needed to prevent the Tyrians from concentrating their forces at that narrow point . Consequently , the Macedonian commander planned to divide the enemy defenders by staging a combination of concentrated and diversionary attacks simultaneously made both from land and sea . The two days following the initial failed assault were devoted to preparations for the final effort . Every ship and soldier was made ready , as proper places were assigned and orders given to attack at a prearranged signal . The Tyrians in the meantime had also taken steps to strengthen their position by building a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , with more favorable weather , Alexander gave the signal to launch the attack . Under cover of a concentrated barrage of missiles , the ram ships safely moved into position at the breach site . Under a relentless pounding from the rams , the walls eventually began to shatter . Once a sufficiently wide section was battered down , the attackers withdrew the ram ships and rowed two transport ships-modified into landing craft and carrying Alexander and 2,000 of the best troops in the Macedonian army-to the wall . In what is believed to be the first known use of maritime boarding bridges , two gangways were lowered onto the rubble of the wall . // Alexander 's March of Conquest // Alexander 's March of Conquest // Alexander led his crack troops across the bridges and encountered fierce resistance . The tightly packed Macedonians suffered from the volleys of Tyrian arrows showering down on them , but they were eventually able to secure the breach and the flanking battlements .

Once in position , Macedonian troops in the towers lowered gangways onto the wall and stormed across . Tyrian opposition was vigorous , but the Macedonians took the inner landward wall . Simultaneously , Alexanders fleet crashed through the Sidonian and Egyptian harbor defenses . The Phoenician and Cyprian sailors captured or destroyed the Tyrian ships as seaborne Macedonian soldiers stormed onto the island . While all this was going on , a diversionary flotilla of ships carrying catapults and assault troops circled around the island , put ashore and attacked at various points . With the success of this four-pronged attack , the Tyrians abandoned the wall . Barricading the narrow streets as they retreated , they rallied their forces at their main citadel , the Agenorium , in the city 's northern section . Once in control of the southern battlements , Alexander and his troops joined with the other Macedonian forces and fought their way toward the Agenorium . There , the battle was intense , and although the Tyrians fought with courage and resourcefulness , they were eventually overpowered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Historian Theodore A. Dodge wrote that " the Macedonians were enraged at the obstinacy of the city 's defense and the cruelties practiced on Macedonian prisoners captured by the Tyrians , who had tortured and put them to death on the walls in full sight of the army , and thrown the bodies into the sea , thus depriving them of the rights of burial . " In revenge , 8,000 Tyrian soldiers fell by the sword when the city was stormed . Alexander pardoned all who had taken refuge in the Temple of Heracles , among whom was King Azemilk of Tyre , the city 's magistrates and ambassadors from Carthage . The rest of the population-some 30,000 people-were sold into slavery , in accordance with the custom of Greek warfare . On the following day , Alexander sacrificed to Heracles , dedicating to the demigod the siege engine that had broken the city wall . He also gave a lavish funeral for the Macedonian dead and celebrated his victory with a grand military parade and naval review . The great city of Tyre , hitherto impregnable , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Egypt now surrendered to Alexander . Deprived of all its harbors and cut off from its home government , the Persian fleet soon scattered and disappeared . Alexanders grand strategic plan that led to the neutralization of the Persian fleet-requiring his army to march some 1,300 miles over two years , fight two pitched battles and undertake three sieges-represents " the first and only time in history a maritime power had been defeated by a land-based power , " according to Peter Bamm . With Greece , the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean coast firmly under Macedonian control , Alexander could now turn inland and concentrate his strategy exclusively on land operations . The siege and capture of Tyre highlighted Alexander 's tenacity , leadership and strategic insight . It also showcased the Macedonian 's imaginative genius , as he optimized the value of available weapons , both land and seaborne . Some of the types of equipment , structures and engines employed in the operation had been used before , but many others were invented or greatly improved for use during the siege . The construction and ultimate completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering requiring a vast earth-moving operation that forever changed the area 's geography . Progressively widened by centuries of silt , the structure still connects Tyre to the mainland . Finally , to capture the city required a brilliantly planned and coordinated assault-the first combined land , amphibious and naval operation in history . In the final analysis , Alexanders great siege of Tyre some 2,300 years ago endures as one of the most remarkable sieges in the annals of warfare . <p>
