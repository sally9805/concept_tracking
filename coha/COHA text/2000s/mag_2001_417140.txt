interiors Headnote " I TOLD MYSELF I WENT TO BE WITH SHAKA BECAUSE NO MAN OR WOMAN SHOULD BE ALONE ON SUCH A MORNING . BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IT WAS / WHO NEEDED TO DRAW STRENGTH FROM HIM . ' BY ASHANTI CHIMURENGA Photograph Chimurenga ( top ) , prisonrights advocate , and her dear friend Shake Sankofa. // As I write this , it has been a little more than a year since June 22 , 2000 . That was the day the state of Texas executed Shaka Sankofa for a crime that he did not commit but was convicted of , based on the testimony of a single witness . It has been 12 months since I stood with Shaka in the anteroom to the execution chamber and watched his face light up with a smile . He told me that no matter how things turned out with his execution , the community 's increased awareness of what was taking place behind prison walls was a stride forward in the historical struggle against race and class oppression . Twelve months since I watched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to excruciating anguish . It has been 12 long months since I sprawled halfway under a bed , my mind stretched to the limits of sanity , my mouth unleashing screams into a telephone thrown across the room as if it were the carrier of the deadly venom . My poor mother on the other end of the line-except there is nothing poor about her warrior-queen spirit-patiently waited for the shouting and weeping to subside to tell me to rise to my feet , wipe my tears away and go stand tall on death row with a man whose life she knew had transformed her child . It has been 12 months since I took my place in front of him with dignity and strength and slammed my clenched Black fist into the glass that separated us . I watched his body dance to that sound of resistance that I wanted him to hear his sister make . He was the rock and I am the stone . We will always endure . It was 1993 when I first met Gary Graham , who would later change his name to Shaka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist in a world dedicated to love and compassion , a world meant to nourish and ensure the progress of our children and future generations . At that time , I was the director of a humanrights program . Our organization based its opposition to capital punishment on the belief that every human being has the inalienable and fundamental right to human dignity , which includes the right to be free of deliberate extinction through judicial homicide . This principle is recognized by the United Nations , which has called for all countries to retreat from the death penalty . As a former criminal defense lawyer , I had had firsthand experience with the brutal impact of the law on poor people and people of color in a system riddled with inequity . I knew that the conviction of innocent people was far more common than the public believes . I was absolutely certain then , as I am now , that handing over the power of execution to a system that has done little to repudiate its bloody history of slavery and Jim Crow laws and puts the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder is at best insane ; at worst , it 's a betrayal of ourselves . When I first sat across from Shaky Sankofa , I studied the signs of stress triggered by the rapidly approaching execution date . He was exceptionally calm , but his pupils were dilated , giving his eyes the feverish cast of the deathly ill . It was clear that this 29-year-old Black man was coming to grips with the dimming likelihood of his ever reaching 30 . During those early visits , I learned that Shaka had been only 17 when he was charged with robbing and killing a White man in 1981 ; that he 'd been represented by a court-appointed lawyer who 'd had a number of grievances filed aginst him regarding his prior performance on behalf of other death-row prisoners ; that Shaka 's pleas of innocence were ignored for 12 years until new lawyers found evidence that overwhelmingly demonstrated he had been wrongly convicted . I had come to that Texas prison because I wanted to put a face on a cause I had been championing . Too often , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call their names and conjure up images . By the time a spontaneous national movement fighting for Shaky s freedom exploded on the scene in 1993 and halted the execution date that threatened his birthday , we had become close friends . Though seemingly very different , our lives had points of connection that were meaningful to our growth and political outlook . Both of us had been teenage parents who had veered off the orthodox path early in life . We had wandered until we turned youthful adversities into reasons to become empowered adults . Behind bars , Shaka had overcome a cycle of pain stemming from childhood abuse and neglect that led to adolescent drug addiction and juvenile violence . He had grown into a vibrant and articulate leader and scholar of the Black experience . In open society , I had become an educated advocate and professional committed to the development and progress of my community and other oppressed peoples . Both late bloomers , we had a message for young brothers and sisters and the 2 million in prison . In our shared philosophy , every human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed into a force that could uplift mind , spirit and soul . We believed there was not a lost soul on this earth . In the beginning I struggled , often faltered , but Shaka gave me a level of confidence and optimism that buoyed me above the churning terror of genocide that is the death penalty . I learned to stare at jailers and executioners at the eleventh hour and continue to believe I would be the victor . Shaka taught me that . I saw him do it every day . I stored his lessons of strength and vigilance and hope inside me , so I could take them to others to sprinkle like juju dust in every school and prison and ghetto and place that a soul or body is under subjugation . Shaka survived not only that first execution date but also two others , which came in rapid succession . Each brought him within a few hours of death . On every one of those three dates , we would start the morning together . I told myself that I was up at dawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such a morning . But the reality is that it was I who needed to draw strength from him and his incredible determination to survive death row . Though I knew much about fighting for others , I learned from Shaka the importance of valuing my own life and never accepting defeat . When he was finally murdered on his sixth execution date , after 19 years on death row , he was my best and favorite teacher , the closest friend I had ever had . I fled my home in New York for Barbados a few weeks after Shaky was killed . My mind was no longer making me any promises . In a shaky hand I had written in my journal " Shaka 's body is at the end of a road-30 feet from a large tree . " I was a limp paper bag , greasy and porous , through which my world was seeping . I could have said I was suicidal , but I was too stubbornly Black and resistant to genocide to part with myself . They could n't have him and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Shaka to be administered the lethal injection , he chose not to go silently but to resist , not to die a wrongfully convicted killer but to be murdered as a fighting revolutionary . With his last breath , his words were of love and resistance . I 'm doing something with the freedom Shaka taught me : I 'm staying alive , and I 'm going back to death row again and again , to fight on and on , until it is no more .
