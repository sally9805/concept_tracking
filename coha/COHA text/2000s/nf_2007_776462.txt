A few years ago Sheri Saltzberg and Mark Grashow of New York , recently retired from public health administration and teaching , went to Zambia for a wedding . Their son suggested they go to Zimbabwe to visit a family that had befriended him and to see Victoria Falls . While they were there , they visited several schools and were appalled to see that there were no textbooks , empty libraries , no science equipment , no basic school supplies , and often no school breakfast or lunch . // When they got home they founded their own NGO , the U.S.-Africa Children 's Fellowship , and formed a partnership with the Zimbabwe Organization of Rural Associations for Progress , which had been working since 1980 to help improve the economy and education in individual communities . // Over the next two years , they located thirty-five U.S. schools to partner with thirty-five schools in Zimbabwe , and they 've shipped four forty-foot containers to the schools , with more than 150,000 books , school supplies , toys , games , sports equipment , bicycles , clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They raise funds for items needed but not donated-school uniforms , locally printed books , and educational materials and scholarships . // In the U.S. partner schools , Mark and Sheri try to give students an appreciation for what life is like for their counterparts in Zimbabwe . American kids learn that the kids in their partner school often get up at 5 a.m. to walk several miles to school , may well have nothing to eat , and may have lost one or both parents to AIDS . They also learn that many kids do n't go to school at all because they ca n't afford the school fees , uniforms , or even a notebook and pencil ; they have to work to support or stay home to care for a sick parent or younger sibling ; or they do n't have shoes and ca n't walk long distances in winter . The American children are empowered to take action  --  collecting donations and writing letters to the Zimbabwean students . // Mark and Sheri themselves fly to Zimbabwe as each shipment arrives and help distribute the donations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have far exceeded anything we dreamed of " says Mark . " For the first time , students can take books home to read . Five percent of the kids in the seventh grade used to pass reading tests ; now it 's 60 percent . Three years ago , only one student in his district passed his A-level exams for university . This year , thirty-eight students passed . There are now art and sewing classes . Soccer flourishes because there 's an abundance of soccer balls . Attendance in many kindergartens has increased threefold due to the introduction of toys . In September we 'll increase the schools we partner with from thirty-five to fifty . " The program has proven so successful , there 's now a waiting list of three hundred schools . // Why did they do this ? Mark says , " I believe that each of us has an obligation to level the playing field of life . Schools that have no books , communities without water , and people without access to medical care are not someone else 's problem . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to decide if we have the will to do it .
