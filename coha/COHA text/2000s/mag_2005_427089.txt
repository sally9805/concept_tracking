Between Mike Bennis ' Minnow bucket and Mabel Henderson 's frying pan , it was a good trip all around . Florida 's finest crappies scarfed down the minnows , and we scarfed down the crappies . It was love at first bite . Things did n't start that easily , of course , because they never do . As we idled the bass boat through the morning fog out from Henderson 's Fish Camp to the broad reaches of Florida 's Lake Istokpoga , Bennis was grumbling . " The fishing has n't been right , " he said . " You should have been here last month . Darn this fog . " This is typical guide talk , to keep sports from having unrealistic expectations . I 've heard it before . As Bennis and I chatted a bit , though , I found out that we were fishing at a time when the lake 's crappies were in a transition phase . Prime open-water fishing for schooling crappies usually happens from September through November , Bennis told me . Spawning season , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as February in Florida and extends into April . During the transition , with the fish on the move , neither open-water nor shallow fishing would be as good as it could be . " So when in doubt , " I said , " try everything ! " That 's exactly what we proceeded to do . JIGS AND GRUBS We rigged 1/16-ounce Blakemore RoadRunners ( small jigheads with spinner blades ) on ultralight spinning rods spooled with 4-pound-test monofilament , adding a 11/2-inch soft-plastic brown grub to each bare jig . Following orders , I made a long cast to the rear with one rod and a medium-length cast with the second . As Bennis used the trolling motor to move the boat along a 10-foot-deep channel , he explained that different line lengths off the rods would spread the trolled lures vertically . The one on the longer line would run deeper . " Do n't set the hook if you feel a fish , " he said . " That 'll tear it out of the thin-skinned mouth . Reel in gently and you wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weedbeds where crappies would soon begin spawning . It was a perfect staging area . Watching the fishfinder , I was starting to see fish spread from 5 to 8 feet deep when one of the rods bowed and bounced . As I reeled in , Bennis tossed a marker buoy over the side . " Supper , " I said , tossing the fish into the live well . Additional passes past the buoy brought in more crappies . " So today they like red , " Bennis said , unhooking one that had taken a red-headed jig . Crappies are indeed color selective , and what they go for can change daily , if not hourly . That 's why crappie jigs come in such an array of hues . Bennis said I could simplify things by sticking with the basics , such as white , black , chartreuse , yellow , and red , one of which would usually catch fish . After we caught a few more , I suggested we try the shallows while the minnows were still lively . We took a break , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crappie pole is a deliberate exercise . Bennis set us up with 10-footers  --  anything longer feels clunky , he said  --  with about 7 feet of 8-pound-test monofilament tied to the tip . There was a fine-wire , size 6 Aberdeen crappie hook tied to the other end of the line , a small split shot a few inches above it , and then a round , nickel-size bobber 30 inches above that . The water in the broad patches of spatterdock where we fished was 3 to 4 feet deep with a sandy bottom  --  prime spawning territory for crappies . Rigging each hook with a 2-inch-long fat-head minnow , we used the poles to dip the baits into openings among the weeds . The setup was perfect for the conditions . Any sort of cast and retrieve with regular tackle would have been impossible because the cover was so thick . It took three or four dips in different spots before my bobber darted under , and I was soon hauling a crappie from the weeds . Later , I tried dipping and twitching a small soft-plastic tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prespawn , the fish were simply not being aggressive . Sweetening things with a live minnow helped , though , and I soon had another one . Back at Henderson 's , Bennis , good guide that he is , filleted our mess of crappies . We hit the market for flour , eggs , and canola oil , then stopped at a stand for tomatoes and lettuce . The beer was cold . The salad was fresh . The fillets sizzled . And that is as good as it gets . BEER-BATTER CRAPPIES Rinse chilled skinless fillets , pat dry with paper towels , and cut into 2-inch-square chunks . Add canola oil to a depth of 1/2 inch in a cast-iron frying pan and start heating it . To make the batter , mix one egg , 1/2 cup flour , and 1/2 cup cold beer . The mixture should be about the same consistency as a thick pancake batter . Add more beer or flour as needed to get it right ; the proportions are n't critical . Dip the crappie fillet chunks in the batter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small batches . The canola oil should be hot enough so that they sizzle sharply . Use a slotted spoon or spatula to turn them after approximately three minutes . Total cooking time to get them crispy brown on both sides will be five to six minutes . Season to taste after cooking . I like a little garlic salt . TAKE THE FIELD &; STREAM SURVEY ! ARE YOU A GUN NUT ? If you are , drop that bore brush and go to fieldandstream.com to take our very first Online Gun Nut Opinion Poll .
