One About a year after they had rented the farmhouse with loose brown aluminum siding on Whitefeather Road , Saul began glaring out the west window after dinner into the unappeasable darkness that pressed against the glass , as if he were angry at the flat uncultivated farmland for being farmland instead of glass and cement . " No sane Jew , " he said , " ever lived on a dirt road . " Patsy reminded him of Poland , Russia , and the nineteenth century . Then she pointed down at the Scrabble board and told him to play . To spite her , he spelled out " axiom " over a triple-word score , for forty-two points . " That was totally different , " Saul said , shaking his head . " Completely different . That was when everyone but the landowners lived on dirt roads . It was a democracy of dirt roads , the nineteenth century . " Patsy was clutching her bottle of root beer with one hand and arranging the letters on her slate with the other . Her legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positioned against the instep of her right foot . She looked up at him and smiled . He could n't help it ? he smiled back . She was so beautiful , she could make him copy her gestures without his meaning to . " We 're not landowners either , " she said . " We 're renters . Oh , I forgot to tell you . I had to go into the basement this afternoon for a screwdriver , and I noticed that there 's a mouse in the trap downstairs . " " Is it dead ? " " Oh , sure . " She nodded . " It looks quite dead . You know -- smashed back , slightly open mouth , and bulging eyes . I 'll spare you the full description . You 'll see the whole scene soon enough when you go down there -- I did n't want to throw it out myself . " " I did the dishes , " Saul complained , sitting up , running his fingers through his hair . " I could throw the mouse out , " Patsy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliging smile . " I can now , and I could have then . " She straightened her leg and placed her foot against his ankle , and she raised her eyebrows as an ironic courtesy . " But the truth is , those little critters give me the whimwhams , and I 'd rather not . I 'd rather you did it , Saul . Just , you know , as a favor to me . You do it , my man , and there might be something in it for you . " " What ? What would be in it for me ? " " The trick in negotiations , " she said , " is not to make promises too soon . Why do n't you just do it as a favor to me ? A sort of little gratuitous act of kindness ? One of them guys ? " He stood up , shaking the letters on the Scrabble board , and clomped in his white socks to the kitchen , where the flashlight was stuck to the refrigerator with a magnet that was so weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was only halfway there now . " I did n't say you had to do it instantly , " Patsy shouted . " This very minute . You could wait until the game is over . " " Well , if you did n't want it thrown out now , you should n't have mentioned it . Besides , I ca n't concentrate , " Saul said , half to himself as he flicked the flashlight off and on , " thinking about that dead mouse . " The batteries were so low that the light from the bulb was foggy and brown . He opened the door to the basement , fanning stale air , and stared down the steps into the darkness that smelled of must and heating oil . He did n't like the basement . At night , in bed , he thought he heard crying from down there , ancestral accusations . " You 'll do anything to beat me at Scrabble , " Saul said aloud to himself . " This is gamesmanship , honey . Do n't tell me otherwise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the steps sawtoothed themselves in front of him . " I really do n't like this , " he said , walking down the stairs , a sliver from the banister leaping into the heel of his hand . " This is not my idea of a good time . " He heard Patsy say something consoling and inaudible . On his left were the wooden shelves once meant for storing preserves . On these shelves , mason jars , empty and gathering dust , now lined up unevenly . Saul and Patsy 's landlord , Mr. Munger , a retired farmer and unsuccessful freelance preacher who had a fitful temper , had thrown their lids together into an angry heap on a lower shelf . The washtubs were on Saul 's right , and in front of him , four feet away , was the sprung mousetrap . The mouse had been pressed flat by the trap , and its tiny yellow incisors were showing at the sides of its mouth , just as Patsy had said . He loved her , but she could be manipulative when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to do . Maybe , out of his sight , she was exchanging her letter tiles . Saul grunted , loosened the spring , and picked up the mouse by the tail , which felt like cold rubber . His fingers brushed against the animal 's downy fur , soft as milkweed pods . Being , on a miniature scale , had once been inhabited there . With his other hand he held the flashlight . He heard other mice scratching in the basement corners . Why kill mice if there were always going to be more of them ? After climbing the stairs and opening the back door , he set the flashlight down : the cool air and the darkness made his flesh prickle . Still holding the tiny pilgrim , he took four steps into the backyard . Feeling a scant moment of desolation , nothing more than a breeze of feeling , he threw the mouse toward the field , its body arcing over the tiny figure on the horizon of a distant radio transmitting tower , one pulsing red light at its tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midwestern landscape excited him . There was a sensual loneliness here that belonged to him now , that was truly his . He thought that fate had perhaps turned him into one of those characters in Russian literature abandoned to haphazard fortune and solitude on the steppes . Nothing out there seemed friendly except the lights on the horizon , and they were too far away to be of any help . He walked into the living room , where Patsy was wrapped in a blanket . " Good news and bad news , " Saul said , tilting his head . " The good news is that I threw out the mouse . The bad news is that it , she , was pregnant . Maybe that 's good news . You decide . By the way , I see that you 've wrapped yourself in a blanket . Now why is that ? Too cold in here ? " She had dimmed the light , turning the three-way bulb to its lowest wattage . She was n't sitting in the chair anymore . She was lying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand gesture she parted the blanket : she had taken off her clothes except for her underwear , and just above her breasts she had placed six Scrabble letters : HI SAUL " Nine points , " he said , settling himself down next to her , breathing in her odor , a clear celery-like smell , although tonight it seemed to be mixed with ether . He picked the letters off her skin with his teeth and one by one gently spat them down onto the rug . " I guess it 's good news , " Patsy said , " that we do n't have all those baby mice in a mouse nursery down there . " She kissed him . " Um , " Saul said . " This was what was in it for me ? " " Plain old married love , " Patsy said , helping him take his jeans off . Then she lifted up her pelvis as he removed her underwear . " Plain old married love is only what it is . " He moved down next to her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'll go to any length to avoid losing in Scrabble . I think it 's a character weakness on your part . Neurotic rigidity . David Shapiro talks about this in his book on neurotic styles . Check it out . It 's a loser 's trick . I spelled out ' axiom ' and you saw the end of your possibilities . " " It 's not a trick , " she said , absentmindedly stroking his thighs , while he pointed his index finger and pretended to write with it across her breasts and then down across her abdomen . " Hey , " she said , " what 're you writing with that finger ? " " ' I love Patsy , ' " he said . " I 'm not writing it , I 'm printing it . " " Why ? " " Make it more readable . " " ' I love Patsy , ' " she said . " Seventeen points . " " Sixteen . And it depends where it 's placed . " " A V is worth four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caressing her right breast , and with the other he wrote other words with imaginative lettering across her hips . " I do n't remember making love in this room before . Especially not with the shades up . " She stretched to kiss his face and to tease her tongue briefly into his mouth . Then she trailed her finger across his back . " I can do that , too . " She traced the letters with her finger just under his shoulders . " That was an I , " Saul said . " Yes . " " ' I love Saul ' ? " he asked . " Is that what you 're writing ? " " You 're so conceited . So self-centered . " " The curtains are parted , " he said . " The neighbors will see . " " We do n't have neighbors . This is the rural middle of American nowhere . Always has been . " " People will drive by on Whitefeather Road and see us having sex on the sofa . " He waited . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . He laughed . " You 're wicked , Patsy . " " You keep using old adjectives , " she said , sliding her hands up the sides of his chest . " Old blah-blah adjectives that no one uses anymore . That 's a habit you should swear off . Let those people watch us . They might learn something . " She slithered down to kiss the scar on his knee , then moved up . " The only thing I mind about sex , " she said after another minute , " and I 've said this before , is that it cuts down on the small talk . " " We talk a lot , " Saul said , positioning himself next to her and finally entering her . He grunted , then said , " I think we talk more than most people . No , I 'm sure of it . We 've always jabbered . Most people do n't talk this much , men especially . " He was making genial moves inside her . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does surveys ? " " Oh , Saul , " she said . " You know , I 'm glad I know you . Out here in the wilds a girl needs a pal , she really does . You 're my pal , Saul . You are . I love you . " " It 's true , " he said . " We 're buddies . Bosom buddies . " He kissed a breast . On an impulse , he twisted slightly so that he could reach over to the card table behind him and scoop up a handful of Scrabble letters from the playing board . " Are n't you too cute . What 're you doing ? " she asked . " I 'm going to baptize you , " he said , slowly dropping the tiled letters on her face and shoulders and breasts . " I 'm going to baptize you in The Word . " " God , " she said , as a P and an E fell into her hair , " to think that I wanted to distract you with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired eighteen months earlier to teach American history , journalism , and speech in the Five Oaks High School . In its general appearance and in its particulars , however , Five Oaks , Michigan , was not what he and Patsy had had in mind . They had planned to settle down in Boston , or , in the worst-case scenario , the north side of Chicago , a good place for a young married couple . They had been working at office jobs in Evanston after graduating from Northwestern , and one day , driving home along the lake , Saul seemed to have a seizure of frustration . He began to shout about the supervision and the random surveillance , how he could n't breathe or open his office window . " Budget projections for a bus company , " he said , " is no longer meaningful work , and it turns out that it never was . " He rambled on about getting certified for secondary school because he needed to contribute to what he called " the great project of undoing the dumbness that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting on the passenger side and working at a week-old Sunday crossword , " you 're underlining your words again . " " This country is falling into the hands of the rich and stupid , " Saul grumbled , underlining his words while waving his right hand in an all-purpose gesture at the windshield . " The plutocrats are taking over and keeping everybody ignorant about how things are . The conspiracy of the inane starts in the schools , but it gets big results in business . Everywhere I 've looked lately I 've seen a cynic in a position of tremendous responsibility . We 're being undermined by rich cynics and common people who have been , forcibly , made stupid . This has got to stop . I 've got to be a teacher . It 's a political necessity . At least for a few years . " " There 's lots of stupidity out there , Saul , " Patsy said , glancing up at a stoplight . " A big supply . You think you 're going to clear it away ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light just turned green . Pay attention to the road , please . " She smiled . " ' Drive , he sd . ' " She reached out and touched him on the cheek . " ' For christ 's sake , look out where yr going . ' " " Do n't quote Creely at me . I 'm the big man for the job , " Saul said . " This country needs me . " " Well , of course . " She scratched her hair . " Write an editorial , why do n't you ? Nine letters for ' acidic . ' First letter is V and the fourth one is R. " " ' Vitriolic , ' " Saul said . " And you could get certified , too . Or you could insinuate yourself into a bureaucracy and reorganize it . You 're so lovable , everybody just does what you ask them to do , without thinking . Boston is full of deadwood . God knows , you can reorganize deadwood . It 's been proved . " He waited . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved out of here . What do you want to do , Patsy ? " " Finger-exercise composer , " Patsy said . " Six letters , last letter Y and first letter C. " " Czerny . " " Boston , huh ? " She gazed at the sky . " It 's sort of hard to get teaching jobs there , is n't it ? Oh , and , by the way , what am I going to do if you start teaching ? I do n't want to teach . " " That 's what I was just asking you . You 're not listening to me . What do you want to do ? " Patsy had had half-a-dozen majors before she settled for a double major in dance-performance and English . " I do n't know , " she said . " I do n't know what I want to do . " She studied the sky . " I 'd like to go work in a bank , actually . " Another pause . " In the mortgage department . " The statement was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shifty , ironical asides whose subtext you had to go in search of . Then he realized that perhaps she meant it , and he studied her face for aspersions , but Patsy , who was vehement about privacy issues , did not give herself away .
