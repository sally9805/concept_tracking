London , 1816 <p> " So this is really goodbye , then ? " Vanessa stared up at him with watery blue eyes . <p> Matthew tried his best to be the coldhearted scoundrel his reputation demanded , but it never worked with her . Drawing her into his arms , he said with regret , " You know I ca n't afford your retainer any longer . " <p> " I always thought ... " <p> She did n't need to say another word . He knew exactly what she thought and maybe at one time it might have worked . As a second son , he could afford to be frivolous with his reputation , but not now . Two accidents and his life had changed in so many ways . <p> " It 's not fair , " she mumbled into his chest . " I know a mistress is n't supposed to fall in love with her protector , but ... " <p> " Shh , Vanessa . " <p> " How could you not have known the debts he incurred ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silky texture . He would miss her but the time had come to end this with her . She had become far too serious about loving him and becoming more than just a mistress . <p> " I thought that was David 's responsibility . I had no idea that the two of them were so irresponsible with the estates and the money . " Pausing for a moment , he finally added , " And I was no better than either of them . " <p> " I could help you , " she whispered . <p> " I 'm afraid you know that would never work . " Vanessa 's love had been constant for a year . While he did n't return the feelings in the same manner , he never wanted to hurt her with the truth . <p> " I would be a good wife . " <p> Matthew blew out a long breath wanting to end this quickly , but he felt unable to hurt her . She had been there for him when he needed her . <p> " Darling , you will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get myself out of this mess my father and brother left me in , I 'll help you any way I can . " <p> " But a wife , Matthew ? Must you marry to save yourself ? " She drew her fingers along the lapel of his jacket . <p> " You know as well as I , there is no other way out of this disaster . " But he still wondered just what type of woman would want him and his reputation . <p> She pulled away and looked up at him . Her diminutive stature forced her neck back . " Do you honestly think you will be able to find a woman of your social rank ? " <p> " Yes . I am the earl now . There are always fathers who want their daughters to be a countess . " <p> " Until her father discovers your name . Then he 'll make certain his little darling does n't marry a killer . " <p> His body tensed . " I will find a wife , Vanessa . " <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pay for this . Go to her and let her family pay you for what you did for her . " <p> " I do n't believe they know what happened that day . " At least that had been the plan . No one would ever know except them . <p> " Well , they should . " She turned away and dropped to the sofa , crossing her arms over her chest . " She has spent the last five years doing as she pleased while you were the one in distress . You were the one scorned . Her reputation never suffered from her actions that day . " <p> " This has nothing to do with her , Vanessa . Everything that happened is my father 's fault . He should have known better than to gamble away his fortune . And David was no better . Besides , I need more than money . I need my reputation improved with the help of a woman of quality . " <p> He only hoped that some man out there would be so desirous of a title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came with it . After five long years , he craved the friendship of his peers . Respectable peers . Not the scoundrels who befriended him once he 'd destroyed his reputation . <p> " I should be leaving . " He knelt down and clasped her hands in his . " You will be all right , Vanessa . You 're beautiful and will have another protector in days . " <p> Vanessa looked away from him . " I do n't want another protector , Matthew . " <p> " It will never work out between us . " <p> She stared wistfully down at their joined hands . " After you have married , if I 'm available ... " She paused , blinked hard and then continued , " Will you have me again ? " <p> Matthew dropped his head to her lap . He 'd always assumed someday in the far off future , he would fall in love and the woman would n't care about his reputation . But now ? There was every likelihood the woman he married would only do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he doubted he 'd ever fall in love with a woman whose only concern was herself . At the same time , he knew his time with Vanessa was done . <p> " If I do n't love her , then I might be tempted to take a mistress again , " he said only to appease her . <p> He looked up to see a catlike grin cross her face as she said , " Then I will pray you do n't fall in love . " <p> He smiled back at her . He knew there was little chance of falling for a woman who only wanted his title . <p> " Perhaps I might think of a few women you should court , " she said , absently twirling a lock of golden hair around her finger . " After all , I do know quite a few gentlemen with sisters . " <p> " Oh ? " <p> She rolled her blue eyes and smiled coyly . " I did n't mean I know them that way , Matthew . But I always have to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl might find herself on the street . " <p> " Like now , perhaps ? " <p> " I 'm hardly on the street . With the money you 've generously given me over the past two years , I will be able to stay here for months . " <p> He rose and straightened his gray jacket . " Wish me well ? " <p> Vanessa pouted but stood and wrapped her arms around him . Leaning in close , she kissed him fully on the mouth . For once , her overt passion had no impact on him . He was done with her . Slowly , she drew away . <p> " I wo n't say good-bye , Matthew . You will return to me , begging me to take you back . " <p> " Good-bye , Vanessa , " he whispered . <p> " Come along , " Somerton said , half dragging Matthew into the candlelit ballroom with him . <p> " I was n't invited , " Matthew insisted . <p> " Neither was I. But it 's never stopped me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glanced over at Matthew and shook his head . " You have a leaf in your hair . " <p> " Well , if you had n't insisted we jump the fence , I would n't have been snagged on that branch . " Matthew quickly drew his hands through his hair . The last time he 'd sneaked into a ball he 'd been seventeen . Now , thirteen years later , he was still acting like an immature adolescent . <p> " I really do n't think we should be here , " he tried again . <p> Somerton shot him a quelling look . " Men with reputations like ours do n't get invited . If you wish to go through with this mad idea of marriage , you must be in the company of women . Preferably women of your rank . " <p> " Very well . " <p> Matthew had spent the past week and a half attempting to secure invitations to parties , balls , even musicales . Anything that would bring him back into the ton . Unfortunately , nothing had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full swing for months , he had to make do with the few parties held in London in the fall . <p> His first musicale ended in disaster as no one would even sit near him . He had n't needed to hear the women to know they were discussing his attendance behind their brightly colored fans . <p> " I 'm off to the gaming room . Enjoy yourself , if that is possible , " Somerton said , then walked away . <p> Enjoy himself ? Hardly . Matthew scanned the room for anyone he might know who could make introductions if needed . The large dance floor appeared washed in colored silk as couples glided past with the variety of dance steps . Crystal chandeliers reflected the flickering candlelight diffusing a warm glow throughout the room . <p> He 'd missed the sights and sounds of Society . <p> As he continued to look around , he noticed people had detected his appearance . A few fingers pointed his way , heads nodded in his direction , and fans rose to cover gossiping lips . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Nicholas Tenbury , the Marquess of Ancroft and the future Duke of Belford , standing next to him . Matthew needed to impart a casual tone when all he felt was tension stringing his muscles taut . <p> " I heard this was a ball for the scoundrels of the ton . " <p> Ancroft laughed . " Well , when I throw a ball , no one knows for certain who will attend . " <p> " I take it you wo n't have your footmen toss me out on the streets ? " <p> " Why should I care if you are here ? Your reputation does n't bother me a bit . If people ca n't understand an accident when one happens then I pity them . " <p> Matthew blinked . This was quite possibly the first time in five years that someone had defended him . What amazed him was the fact that it came from Ancroft . They were barely acquainted with each other . As a second son , Matthew had befriended the less lofty of the ton . <p> " Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . She is n't your type of woman . " <p> " Thank you , " he said softly even as heat crossed his cheeks . He wondered why Ancroft decided she was n't Matthew 's type . Five years ago , she 'd been everything a man could want in a woman . He scanned the room ... Was she here tonight ? <p> He glanced over at Nicholas , who shook his head as if he could read his mind . <p> " She is not in attendance . They are still at the estate . Although , I believe they will return by week 's end for her birthday ball . " <p> Matthew gave him a sharp nod and released a breath . He 'd forgotten her birthday was in October . But he need n't worry about that , for a few days at least . Perhaps by the time she returned , he would have a woman to court . Then he would have no need to see her again . <p> " Come along and I 'll introduce you to a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With whom did you slink in-Somerton ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Crafty scoundrel . He 's always stealing into someone 's party for a chance to play the gaming tables . Damn man always wins , too . " <p> For the first time in weeks , Matthew laughed . <p> As he walked the boundary of the dance floor , the whispers followed him . Nicholas stopped beside an older woman dressed in gold satin with a matching turban wrapped snuggly around her head . <p> " Mrs. Layton , may I introduce Lord Blackburn . " <p> Without a word , her eyes widened , and then she pursed her lips and walked away . The cut was direct , why was he surprised ? <p> " Well , this may be harder than I assumed , " Nicholas commented . " She 's a haughty bitch and her daughter no better . For a woman whose husband left her a fortune from illegal activities , I would have thought she 'd be more open to an introduction . " <p> If that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the others . After several more attempts at introductions , Mr. Seymour allowed him to dance with his daughter . He walked to the dance floor with the quaking Miss Sarah Seymour and thought the pale woman might just faint dead away . <p> " Are you enjoying the ball ? " he asked . <p> She could only nod with her big doe eyes blinking madly . She continually glanced to the side of the dance floor where two young ladies stood watching their every move . They looked as if they might beat him with their fans should he make one improper move . <p> As they danced , he attempted a few more times to get the mute Miss Sarah to speak . Nothing worked . The poor girl with her watery brown eyes and pale skin appeared scared to death of him . When the dance ended , he quickly returned her to her father without a word . <p> Tired of the music and overly loud whispers , he headed to the garden . A beautiful full moon lit his way as he avoided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy . The soft whispers and moans of the couples only increased his frustration . <p> It was n't supposed to be this difficult . He had thought with inheriting the title the ton might have forgotten his reputation . Damn them all . Here he 'd done the honorable thing for a friend and no one even knew . Not that he was looking for accolades on being a good friend and chivalrous man . <p> But could no one see the truth ? <p> Other than the accident , he had been an upstanding citizen . He never seduced an innocent young lady and rarely even chased the widows . He much preferred the companionship of a steady mistress . <p> He sat on an iron bench and stared out into the dying garden . Soon all the leaves would be gone , the flowers dead , and he 'd still be in this damned situation . After a long talk with his solicitor this afternoon , he knew he had enough money to last until the end of the year . Ten weeks at most . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sold . The tenants possibly put out on the street in the middle of winter . <p> He could n't let that happen to them . <p> To him . <p> There had to be another way out of this mess . But he had no time . Even if he took a job ( as if anyone would hire an earl ) , the money earned would never cover his expenses . <p> It was all her fault . <p> Vanessa 's words haunted him . There was one woman who could fix his problems . And cause him untold others . <p> It was all her fault . <p> She should have accepted responsibility . Except , for all he knew , his words had caused her actions that day . He should have kept his mouth firmly shut . <p> Besides , it was n't all her fault . He 'd never given her the chance to take the blame . She had done only what he told her to do , play the frivolous lady with no cares , except of course the current fashion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her raven-black hair , sparkling blue eyes that always held a hint of humor , and legs so long he 'd wanted to kiss every inch of them . He wondered how much she might have changed . <p> Shaking his head , he attempted to rid his mind of these errant thoughts . He could n't see her again . He 'd promised to stay out of her life , leave her and her family alone as penance for his part in what happened that day . <p> And yet , now he had no choice but to reenter Society . Interact with her friends and , quite possibly , her . He 'd paid his dues so now she would have to accept his presence at balls and whatever else he decided to attend . If he actually were invited to a ball , which at this point seemed very unlikely . <p> He still had n't determined how he would integrate himself back into the same Society that shunned him years ago . The reactions so far had not given him any encouragement . Embers of anger flamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reparations for his small part of what happened that day . And he did n't even know if his words had affected her . For all he knew , she might have scorned his heartfelt speech . She 'd certainly rejected his kiss that morning . While he spent five years in purgatory for his action , she 'd done nothing but go back to her prosperous life of shopping , painting , and socializing . <p> No one knew of her part in the destruction of his life . <p> Vanessa thought she knew the entire story , but she did not . <p> No one knew everything , except him . <p> Chapter Two " Come along , it 's your turn now , " Sophie demanded . <p> Jennette stood by the refreshment table and looked over at Sophie . The fancy-dress ball was in full swing . Sophie had dressed like a gypsy in bright-colored skirts with her dark hair falling upon her back and a red mask covering half her face . Jennette had chosen the white gown of an angel to celebrate her twenty-fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested . <p> " They will be fine without you for a few minutes . " <p> " I promised Lansing a dance and Colby one after that , " Jennette tried again . <p> " We need to do this now before the musicians take their break . Once that happens , I 'll be too busy . " <p> " But ... " <p> " No more protests . You invited me to keep everyone entertained with my fortune-telling . " Sophie grabbed Jennette 's hand and tugged her toward the doorway , down the hallway to the salon . The small room had been set for Sophie to read people 's fortunes , and she 'd been doing a brisk business all evening . <p> " Yes , keep them entertained , not me . I do n't even believe in such things as fortune-telling . " <p> No one could predict the future , even if her friend was quite recognized for doing just that . Especially her matchmaking fortunes . The last thing Jennette desired was anyone telling her of her future . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to forget her past . <p> " I know you do n't believe in this , which is why I ca n't understand your vehement protests . It 's just for fun . After all , it is your birthday . " <p> Jennette had waited five long years for this day . After signing more legal papers than she 'd ever imagined today , she was free . With the inheritance from her grandmother , she finally had the money to do what she should have done years ago . ( Continues ... ) <p>
