When I was 16 , the idea of being in a band and making records seemed out of reach to me and Adam and Edge and Larry until we heard the Ramones . Something about their humility and the humor just struck us when we saw them in Dublin in 1977 . They seemed like the antithesis of every other band we went to see , where , intentionally or not , you felt like you were the peasants . In that sense , it was a revolution . More than a musical revolution , it felt like our people were onstage . When I was standing in the State Cinema that night listening to JOEY RAMONE and realizing that there was nothing else that mattered to him , pretty soon nothing else mattered to me . Imagination was the only obstacle to overcome . Anyone could play those four chords . You had to be able to hear it more than you had to be able to play it . Suddenly , a bunch of kids from the north side of Dublin who would never have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop for just long enough to jump on . We were a band before we could play and formed our band around an idea of friendship and shared spirit . That was a preposterous notion before the Ramones .  --  Bono , lead singer , U2
