On a recent Sunday afternoon , the Starbucks coffee shop at Piper 's Alley in Chicago 's Old Town was packed with twentysomethings talking on cell phones , poring over books and newspapers or just dozing off in the store 's soft , overstuffed armchairs . At a tiny table next to the window , Trevor Ulbrick , a law student at Northwestern University , tapped away on his Apple PowerBook while listening to a CD through big , cushy headphones that practically enveloped his head . <P> Ulbrick , 28 , was n't there for the frothy $3 lattes or even the shop 's mellow atmosphere . He came for the high-speed wireless Internet access  --  and he 's willing to pay $30 a month to get it . " I would not be here if they did n't have wireless , " he says . " I do n't like Starbucks coffee . Honestly , I do n't like their pastries either  --  although I 'll buy a cookie so I do n't feel too unethical . " <P> Penny-pinching students like Ulbrick are n't exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year to roll out wireless Internet access in its shops across the country . Now with more than 2,600 Starbucks stores equipped with wi-fi , the duo has created the largest public wi-fi network in the U.S. It is also among the first to test consumers ' appetite for paid wireless access outside the home . <P> The plan was simple : lure droves of tech-savvy customers into the shop with wi-fi , then ply them with grande lattes , oversize Rice Krispies treats and other high-priced snacks . But while the wi-fi hot spots have added modestly to Starbucks ' cachet , they have generated less buzz than a cup of decaf . And some Starbucks watchers doubt that they will add much of anything to the company 's bottom line . " I do n't think it is ever going to be a hugely profitable enterprise for Starbucks , " says InStat/MDR analyst Mike Wolf . Pyramid , an analyst firm , predicts that the monthly wi-fi revenue per customer for all public hot spots around the globe will plummet from $30 today to just $3 in 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analysts love the doom and gloom , " says Lovina McMurchy , director of Starbucks Interactive . " We believe there is money in wi-fi , " she insists . This past summer Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz even pointed to wireless as a factor contributing to the company 's $410 million in revenues in June 2003 , a 27% increase compared with $323 million in June 2002 . Neither Starbucks nor T-Mobile will say how many people are using the service or how much money the venture has actually made . <P> To see for ourselves , TIME sent reporters to four stores that the chain identified as being especially popular among wi-fi users . And while we found lots of people using notebook computers , few were online . For example , at the Astor Place store in New York City , there were more than 100 customers one Sunday night , including 15 with laptops  --  but only three said they were using Starbucks ' wi-fi service .
