<p> His numbers average in single digits , and each year when a new crop of promising recruits arrives , he knows what people say . <p> " Every year they 'll count me out and say , ' Cliff might be the last guy off the bench now , " ' DePaul senior guard Cliff Clinkscales said . " That 's fine . I love it . It makes me work harder . <p> " It does n't bother me because I know how hard I work , and I know what I bring to the game . No matter when I get in or how long I play , when I 'm out there , people are going to know what I bring , whether it 's 20 minutes or two minutes . I play my heart out . " <p> Coach Jerry Wainwright made clear how important his 6-1 point guard is without saying a word . Among the Blue Demons ' senior class of four , it is reserve Clinkscales  --  not key center Wesley Green or toughened starting forward Karron Clarke  --  whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draelon Burns . <p> But Wainwright is n't short on words for Clinkscales either . <p> " I put Cliff in when the going gets tough , " Wainwright said . <p> In a sense , that describes Clinkscales ' college career . <p> The Queens , N.Y. , native brought a measure of fame with him to Lincoln Park , having been featured as a fifth grader on the Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O'Donnell shows as one of the nation 's most promising players . <p> He was one of Dave Leitao 's first recruits , and he and his fellow seniors are the last of the former DePaul coach 's players . Clinkscales played only one season for Leitao , a decent freshman year in which he finished third in Conference USA and 12th in the nation in assist-to-turnover ratio ( 104 to 45 ) . He was one of only five freshmen in school history to have 100 or more assists . <p> Then came transition under a new coach . <p> " The first year under Wainwright maybe was hard because a new coach , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're coach Wainwright 's kids . None of us regrets anything . He treats us like he recruited us  --  no different . We know that , and we 're trying to work hard every day for him . " <p> The feeling is mutual from a coach who has embraced these seniors in general and Clinkscales in particular . <p> " The four of them were the ones who had the most to lose of anyone in the program , and how they 've adapted to my style and personality and leadership wo n't be recognized on my record , but it will be one of the highlights of my career , " Wainwright said . " They had no one to mentor them and no one to put an arm around their shoulders . They took it on the chin from me the last couple years , but they 've grown . " <p> None more than Clinkscales , rarely a starter but the most experienced player on the roster , having played in 92 games entering the season . <p> " I can say without hesitation I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Wainwright said . " He 's really turned into a good player , and because of that , he 's allowed us to grow as a team . He 's an unbelievable workaholic . He 's not the biggest or fastest , and people say he ca n't shoot , but the kid works his tail off and he 's a great role model to the younger players . <p> " The other day in practice , I saw him standing on the sideline and he put his arm around freshman Dar Tucker , telling him where to go in a drill . He would n't have done that two years ago . <p> " I 've said this about Cliff : He 'd make a great coach . His ability on the bench  --  he talks to me constantly , makes suggestions  --  and I 've used him kind of like Boston Red Sox manager Terry Francona uses his closer . I feel I have a great reliever in Cliff .

" Maybe we did n't work as hard as we should have on things like free throws , maybe not concentrating . I thought about that a lot this summer . We got so close to the NIT semifinals at Madison Square Garden . That hurts , and you think about it a lot . <p> " Our focus now is getting to the NCAA tournament . We know this is our last go-around . We think about it every day . <p> " I 've always tried to be a leader , but this year I know as a senior , I really have to step up . We have a lot of new guys , so I 'm trying to lead them in practice , show them the right way to go because they really do n't know how hard it 's going to be and how hard you have to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 at Creighton 7 p.m . <p> Nov. 17 Northwestern 1 p.m . <p> Nov. 24 North Carolina A &T; 1 p.m . <p> Nov. 28 Texas A &M-CC; 7:30 p.m . <p> Dec. 8 at Kansas 1 p.m . <p> Dec. 12 Vanderbilt 7:30 p.m . <p> Dec. 15 UIC 7:30 p.m . <p> Dec. 20 *Mississippi 4:30 p.m . <p> Dec. 21 *Clemson 2 p.m . <p> Dec. 22 *La Salle 2 p.m . <p> Dec. 29 at Detroit 3 p.m . <p> Jan. 3 Villanova 8 p.m . <p> Jan. 5 Providence 7 p.m . <p> Jan. 8 Georgetown 8 p.m . <p> Jan. 12 at St. John 's 11 a.m . <p> Jan. 16 at Villanova 8 p.m . <p> Date Opponent Time <p> Jan. 19 Rutgers 1 p.m . <p> Jan. 21 Florida Gulf Coast 7:30 p.m . <p> Jan. 26 at Marquette 7 p.m . <p> Jan. 30 Syracuse 7:30 p.m . <p> Feb. 2 at Notre Dame 5 p.m . <p> Feb. 5 at Providence 6:30 p.m . <p> Feb. 9 South Florida 1 p.m . <p> Feb. 12 Louisville 7:30 p.m . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Seton Hall 7 p.m . <p> Feb. 27 West Virginia 8 p.m . <p> March 2 Notre Dame Noon <p> March 6 at Cincinnati 6:30 p.m . <p> March 9 at Pittsburgh 11 a.m . <p> *San Juan Shootout , Puerto Rico <p> BLUE DEMONS AT A GLANCE <p> Coach : Jerry Wainwright <p> ( 32-29 , third season ; 218-173 overall , 14th season ) . <p> 2006-07 record : 20-14 , 9-7 Big East ; reached quarterfinals of NIT . <p> Key stat : Six . That 's the number of new faces , including five freshmen rated as one the nation 's top 10 recruiting classes . Forward Mac Koshwal carries the brightest credentials , with some saying he might spend only one year in college . Wainwright has named him the school 's first freshman co-captain . <p> Circle the date : Jan. 8 vs . Georgetown . DePaul opens Big East play with three straight home games , capped by the Jan. 8 matchup against last season 's conference king . The Hoyas return four starters from their Final Four squad . <p> X-factor : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6-9 Green could be the team 's most dominating player because of his skills and basketball IQ . Injuries and attitude have held him back in the past , but will a slimmer physique and senior status mean a breakthrough ? <p> Question mark : Will more size up front make up for the departure of leading rebounder Wilson Chandler ? With Green , 6-10 Koshwal and 6-10 junior-college transfer Matija Poscic , rebounding should be a strength , though 6-6 senior Karron Clarke might be the most important factor . <p> Season will be a success if : DePaul makes the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2004 . <p> Season will be a failure if : The Demons do n't get enough contributions from their touted newcomers . <p> Forecast : The Demons should improve as the season goes on . They will have to by the time the Big East schedule opens , with five conference teams in the preseason Top 25 . <p> ROSTER <p> No . Name Pos . Ht .
