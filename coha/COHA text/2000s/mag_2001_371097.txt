Growing up in New York City  --  and specifically in Manhattan  --  has completely , tremendously informed myself as a person and also everything musical that has come forth from me and everything that my band Beastie Boys has done . What still inspires me to continue to live here is the fact that even as much as New York has changed  --  and there 's a Starbucks on every corner and it 's so expensive to live in Manhattan and all these things that are different from when I grew up here  --  the bottom line is that when you walk down the street or get in a cab or you 're on the subway , you 're still amongst humanity . It 's not segregated the way many American cities are . <P> Message-wise , unfortunately , hip-hop is devoid , at this moment , of any prominent , popular or radical spokespersons . To me , the things that appear in hip-hop today , unfortunately , are not radical . The things that the media blow up as being radical  --  whether it 's homophobia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hate to break the news to people , but there 's nothing radical about any of those things . Those things have been going on in a very mainstream way for a very , very long time here . What 's far more radical is to actually get beyond those entrapments as a society . Who knows ? Maybe in this next decade we 'll see decent people who rise to the forefront and change some things . <P>  --  Reported by Alex Smith
