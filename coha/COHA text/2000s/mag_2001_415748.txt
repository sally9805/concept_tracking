Thought you could dodge sales taxes by making your purchases on the Web ? Think again . // THINK BACK TO YOUR LAST online purchase . Did you pay sales tax ? Maybe , maybe not . It depends on whether you bought from a Web site whose parent company is located in the state where you live . It also matters what you bought-some states tax food but not software ; others tax software but not clothing . And it may also depend on when you made the purchase , since states ' sales tax rates and laws change frequently . Finally , it depends on whether your online merchant bothers to charge its customers sales tax . Has all this got you confused ? You 're not alone . The picture may soon get clearer , but not in a way most Web consumers will like . State and federal officials are working together to make sales taxes on the Net easier for companies to apply and far more common . Some supporters of these changes expect you to be routinely paying sales tax on Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , you may be saying , is n't the Internet supposed to be a tax-free zone ? Not quite . The Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 ( which expires in October but will almost certainly be extended for at least a few more years ) does ban new taxes on Internet access , discriminatory taxes on Internet transactions that two or more states could tax , and taxes for items purchased online that would not be taxed if purchased offline . But it does n't outright ban sales taxes on products bought online . Right now , online retailers typically follow the same sales tax rules as mail-order catalog companies . They 're required to charge you sales tax only if they have a retail store , office , or warehouse in your state . If you live in Maine , for example , and order a pair of snowshoes from llbean.com , you 'll find a 5 percent state sales tax tacked on to your credit card bill . If you order the same snowshoes from your condo in Maui , you 'll dodge the Maine sales tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more to it than that . Even if you order from an out-of-state Web site , in most states you 're still responsible for paying a use tax-a sort of self-imposed sales tax . But if  --  like most Americans-you somehow overlooked paying your use tax this year , you probably need n't worry about government officials knocking on your door . It 's extraordinarily difficult to keep track of use taxes , and most states do n't bother trying ( only a few , including Michigan and North Carolina , provide a line on their state tax return form for reporting use tax ) . The bottom line is that consumers can make the majority of their online purchases without paying a cent in sales or use taxes . UNFAIR ADVANTAGE ? UNDERSTANDABLY , traditional retailers have cried foul : Why should e-merchants enjoy the advantage of offering customers a 5 to 8 percent price break ? " It 's incredibly unfair , " says David Didriksen , who owns a successful bookstore and caf6 in Acton , Massachusetts . " Why 10should Internet companies get a free ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's not right to require some businesses to pay and not others . It puts us at a competitive disadvantage , since our customers end up paying more . " // Civic leaders have joined in the chorus , claiming that municipal services suffer from sales tax revenues lost to the Web . According to Forrester Research , states stand to lose as much as $14 billion in sales and use tax revenue in 2003 due to online purchases that are made tax-free . Does that mean you should blame the dot coms when the potholes in the roadway are n't filled ? Probably not . Less than 1 percent of total retail sales in the United States took place on the Internet in 2000 . Meanwhile , Internet entrepreneurs argue that they 're the ones who need protection , not the brick-and-mortar stores . The young Internet economy needs to gain a foothold unfettered by tax burdens , they say . And the plunge in dot-com stock prices-which is still ongoing at this writing-lends weight to that argument . Suddenly , your neighborhood bookstore may be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , co-CEO of San Francisco-based online shoe store Zappos.com , says having to unravel the red tape of states ' tax laws will hinder the development of dot coms . " I do n't think sales taxes will affect our customer base as long as they 're uniformly applied , " he says . But Hsieh can see the potential for the tax to slow the pace of innovation if companies have to spend time figuring out tax laws . " Better to work on improving products and services , " he contends . Such arguments , however , seem unlikely to sway lawmakers . Broader application of sales taxes to Internet purchases is almost a certainty . In February , Representative Chris Cox ( R-California ) and Senator Ron Wyden ( D-Oregon ) introduced a bill that would extend the Internet Tax Freedom Act while broadening states ' ability to enact their own online sales tax laws covering all Internet transactions . Perhaps most important , the proposed law attempts to simplify and streamline states ' existing sales and use tax systems . Essentially , the bill offers a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Noto tax online purchases if the states make their sales tax rules more uniform . Enter the Streamlined Sales Tax Project , a group established in March 2000 by officials from dozens of states who want to radically simplify sales and use taxes . Proposed legislation developed by the SSTP has already been introduced in several states , and Wyoming recently became the first state to enact a law based on SSTP recommendations . Among the organization 's proposals are uniform definitions of what items should be taxed and a single way to calculate tax rates for items that are shipped to other states . CONSUMER REACTION IN SHORT , you may want to rev up your favorite shopping bot now because the days of tax-free Internet purchases are numbered . How will online consumers react to what amounts to an across-theboard increase in prices ? Opinions vary widely . A Forrester Research study indicates that many consumers are more concerned about shipping charges than about paying sales tax for Internet purchases . Add taxes to shipping costs , though , and some consumers may decide to bypass their browser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason I shop online is to sidestep sales tax , " says Doug Ashford , a systems specialist at a Boston financial services company . " But shipping charges often offset the advantage of not having to pay sales tax . That , combined with waiting for the item to arrive-and occasionally the hassle of having to return an item-tips the scales more toward a traditional retailer . " It makes sense . I plan to send Mysimon out on a few more excursions before the sale ends , too-especially for pricier stuff like PCs , software , and household appliances . But when I want a good cup of coffee and advice from someone who understands my six-year-old 's addiction to Magic Tree House books , I 'll gladly troop to the local bookstore and pay the extra 5 percent for the personal attention .
