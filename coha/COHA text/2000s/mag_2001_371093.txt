Utada Hikaru has a hidden life . She appears to be an ordinary American college student . Last fall she attended classes by day , hung out with friends by night , and like most of her fellow Columbia University freshmen , she has n't settled on a major yet . But there were rumors about her among the students during orientation week  --  stories that were hard to believe . " Most of my friends know the truth , " says Hikaru . " Even before the first day of school , I was talking to this friend who was going to Columbia also , and he told me , ' People all know you 're coming . ' And I go , ' What do you mean ? ' And he said , ' Well , all the Asian kids know , but even the non-Asian students have heard something about the Japanese Britney Spears coming to their school . ' " <P> She 's virtually unknown in the U.S. , but Hikaru , 18 , is Japan 's biggest pop star . The Japanese media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIVA OF THE HEISEI PERIOD ! The Japanese public devours her music : her debut CD , First Love ( 1999 ) , sold more than 9.5 million copies , making it the best-selling album in Japanese history . Her new CD , Distance , is selling just as fast . While other Japanese pop divas are content to sing throwaway tunes in baby-girl tones , Hikaru , who says that growing up she used to go to sleep to Metallica and wake up to Pearl Jam , performs songs that draw from R. and B. , rap and even rock . During a recent MTV Unplugged concert , she surprised fans with a rendition of the Irish rock band U2 's song With or Without You . Except for such occasional covers , Hikaru writes almost all her own material , combining light melodies and strong grooves . Her lyrics , though mostly about adolescent angst , can be intriguingly off center . " Our last kiss/Tasted like cigarettes , " she sings on First Love . <P> Although the press has compared Hikaru to Spears , the two are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . Unlike Britney , Hikaru keeps hers on . " I 'm not like a gorgeous bombshell or anything like that , " she says modestly . " It was just always my music at the front . " Mobbed in Japan , she relishes anonymity in America . " I can never really enjoy being famous , " she says . " So when I can just take a walk and go grocery shopping in New York , it takes a huge load off my back and I feel great . I feel human again , almost . " <P> Hikaru was born in New York City but raised part-time in Tokyo . " When people ask me exactly how much time I spend in each country , I always tell them I have no idea , " she says . " Because my parents have taken me back and forth ever since I was a baby . " Her father Teruzane Utada is a producer and musician who now runs her management company . Her mother Keiko Fuji was a popular enka ( Japanese ballad singer ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her career and moving to the U.S. to find a little peace . ( " I do n't sing anymore , " is all Fuji says now , smiling . ) Hikaru says she got her start when she followed her parents into the studio and began to make recordings around age seven . ( " No , younger ! " shouts her father from nearby . ) Like her mother , Hikaru plans to retire young  --  as early as 28  --  and perhaps pursue neuroscience . " I kind of see myself in a white coat in a lab , working till late evening in front of test tubes , " she says . It 's hard to imagine that Spears has a similar vision of her future .
