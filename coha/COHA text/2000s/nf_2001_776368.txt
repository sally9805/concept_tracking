Alfred , Lord Tennyson // 1809-1892 // b . Somersby , England // Alfred , Lord Tennyson , probably the most popular English poet of his day , was born the fourth of twelve children on August 6 , 1809 . The financial comfort of the Tennyson household was precarious . Tennyson 's father , rector of a local church , practically disowned by his wealthy family , appears to have taken recourse to alcohol and drugs . As an escape from this dark atmosphere , Tennyson turned to writing poetry at the age of eight . // In 1827 , Tennyson published Poems by Two Brothers , a compilation of poems written by Tennyson and his older brother , Charles , and a few written by his brother Frederick . That same year , Tennyson enrolled at Trinity College , Cambridge , where he continued to write poetry winning the 1828 Chancellor 's Gold Medal for his poem " Timbuctoo . " While at Cambridge , he joined the Apostles , an exclusive intellectual society , and became acquainted with Arthur Hallam , another brilliant Victorian man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps his greatest inspiration . In 1830 , Tennyson published the volume , Poems , Chiefly Lyrical , to universal acclaim , but soon after began a decline . In 1831 , his father died and left his family to cope with numerous debts , forcing Tennyson to withdraw from Trinity College and return home . He published another volume , Poems , in 1832 , but it received mostly unfavorable reviews . Then , in 1833 , Hallam died unexpectedly while traveling with his father . Tennyson 's grief , poverty , and family problems ( his brother Edward was committed to a mental asylum the same year Hallam died ) conspired to distract Tennyson from the literary world , and though he continued to write , he published nothing for the rest of the decade . During this time , Tennyson attempted to court Emily Sellwood , the daughter of a family friend of the Hallams . Tennyson and Sellwood were engaged briefly in 1838 , nine years after Arthur Hallam introduced the two , but they were officially separated in 1840 for financial reasons . Caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's low point . // Prospects improved in 1842 , when Tennyson 's friends convinced him to publish the two-volume Poems . The book was a success and helped stabilize Tennyson 's finances as well as his spirits . However , he chose to invest nearly all of his money in a business venture that failed and he lost essentially everything . In 1845 , he received a government pension based on his literary accomplishments and financial need . In 1847 , he published the book-length poem , The Princess , to great acclaim , and three years later , his finances were finally stable enough for him to marry Emily Sellwood . In 1850 , he published In Memoriam , a brilliant lyric sequence memorializing Hallam , and the poem established Tennyson as the greatest poet of the day . Few were surprised when he was appointed Poet Laureate after William Wordsworth 's death . // While Poet Laureate , Tennyson lived happily with his wife and published such works as Maud , and Other Poems , " Charge of the Light Brigade , " and Idylls of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping shape Victorian tastes . In 1883 , he was granted a barony and a seat in the House of Lords by the crown , the first person ever to receive such a position based merely on literary prowess . Tennyson died peacefully at his home on October 6 , 1892 , and was buried in the Poet 's Corner of Westminster Abbey . // Anthony Hecht on Alfred , Lord Tennyson // And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep , In blanch ? d linen , smooth , and lavendered ... //  --  Keats Her limbs are delicate as an eyelid , // Love has blinded him with tears ... //  --  Yeats Music that gentlier on the spirit lies // Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes ... //  --  Tennyson // Here are three eyelid poets ( of the three , Tennyson was the most enamoured of the word ) , all aiming at the same sense of delicacy , beautiful softness , and vulnerability . Yeats might well have had Keats and Tennyson lurking somewhere in the storages of his mind . The three have more than eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some points in their careers , lullingly musical in their commerce with the English language . // In his biography of Auden , Humphrey Carpenter reports that the poet , " began editing a selection of Tennyson 's poetry for a New York publisher ; in his introduction to the volume , he wrote of Tennyson : He had the finest ear , perhaps , of any English poet ; he was also undoubtedly the stupidest . ' This earned the comment from T.S . Eliot that if Auden had been a better scholar he would have known many stupider. " // One must puzzle about Auden 's accusation . Tennyson 's biographer , Robert Bernard Martin , reports in connection with the poet 's student years at Cambridge that , " Though he was no true intellectual he early cast his lot with those who were , " meaning The Apostles , among others . But Martin also declares , " His instincts were deeply conservative , but otherwise tended to confuse political thought with xenophobic patriotism , " which Auden would have deplored ; but it is worth adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostalgia and regret that characterize so much of Tennyson 's most beautiful lyrics . // When Thomas Hardy wished to strike the note of forlorn abandonment , he summons Tennyson by name , and slyly echoes him : // The bower we shrined to Tennyson , // Gentlemen , // Is roof-wrecked ; damps there drip upon // Sagged seats , the creeper-nails are rust , // The spider is sole denizen ; // Even she who voiced those rhymes is dust , // Gentlemen ! // Surely those rusty nails recall the opening of " Mariana " : // With blackest moss the flower-pots // Were thickly crusted , one and all ; // The rusted nails fell from the knots // That held the pear to the gable-wall . // But Tennyson could convey many moods , from the heroic ( " Ulysses " ) to the lethargic ( " The Lotus-Eaters " ) to the neurotic ( " Maud " and " Saint Simeon Stylites " ) . I want here to reflect upon one of his most beautiful , erotic , and languorous songs from The Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now sleeps the crimson petal , now the white ; // Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk ; // Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font . // The fire-fly wakens ; waken thou with me. // Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost , // And like a ghost she glimmers on to me. // Now lies the Earth all Dana ? to the stars , // And all thy heart lies open unto me. // Now slides the silent meteor on , and leaves // A shining furrow , as thy thoughts in me. // Now folds the lily all her sweetness up , // And slips into the bosom of the lake . // So fold thyself , my dearest , thou , and slip // Into my bosom and be lost in me. // Our finest Tennyson critic , Christopher Ricks , observes of this poem , " Tennyson succeeds in the hardest task of all : distinguishing love from lust in erotic poetry . " He also informed me that the poem is a species of Ghazal , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cypress and palace , peacock , stars , and lilies  --  are commonly to be found in Persian love poetry ; and while Tennyson assured a questioner that he knew no Persian , one of his close friends was Edward FitzGerald , translator of The Rubaiyat . // Tennyson was rarely careless ( he was one of the most scrupulous of revisers ) so that we must puzzle about the pronoun " she " in the sixth line , which can refer only to the peacock , which is male . I will attempt to account for this anomaly by suggesting that there is something equivocal about gender throughout the song . In context , it is read sotto voce by the princess as she sits beside her half-conscious prince , with whom , against her firm resolve , she is falling in love . I want to propose that in the course of this brief poem there is a deliberate and conscious shift from the masculine to the feminine posture of the mind , that the first eight lines present an invitation to love , protected by the privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghostly obscurity surrounding the peacock , and the yielding posture of Dana ? ( who thwarts the imprisonment of a puritanical father , the agent of prudery and repression ) and at one with the waking fireflies . But beginning with the ninth line , the mode of expression  --  with the furrowing and planting of thought , its earthen fertility , and the invitation to enter the bosom of the speaker  --  appears to shift to the feminine . And I would suggest that this shift is indicative of the change in the princess herself who initially founded a female university from which men were sternly excluded ; an institution invaded by the prince and mo of his friends , all disguised as women ; they are exposed , and the prince sues for the love of the princess , only to be coldly informed that she has foresworn marriage ; the prince and his fellows are wounded in a tourney whereupon the princess , aroused by sympathy for his plight , begins to yield to the softnesses of affection . The story is in fact that of Shakespeare 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Martin says , " The story begins lightheartedly ... with a direct inversion of all the accepted roles for men , now taken by women , " but in which at the end the old familiar erotic impulses win their way through to a happy ending . // Ulysses // It little profits that an idle king , // By this still hearth , among these barren crags , // Match 'd with an aged wife , I mete and dole // Unequal laws unto a savage race , // That hoard , and sleep , and feed , and know not me. // I can not rest from travel ; I will drink // Life to the lees . All times I have enjoy 'd // Greatly , have suffer 'd greatly , both with those // That loved me , and alone ; on shore , and when // Thro ' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades // Vext the dim sea .
