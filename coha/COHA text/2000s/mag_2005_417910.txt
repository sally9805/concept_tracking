Answer : A Drivers themselves admit dialing a cell phone is the biggest distraction in the car , according to a study by Westlake Village , Calif. - based J.D. Power and Associates . In a survey of nearly 13,000 drivers , 64 percent say dialing a phone is more distracting than eating , drinking or tuning the radio . But that does n't give you the green light to chat away once you 've dialed : Researchers at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City observed 48 adults behind the wheel of a driving simulator and found that drivers who were talking on the phone - even with headsets - missed four times as many exits as drivers talking to a passenger . ( The researchers observed that unlike a person on the other end of a cell phone , a passenger collaborates on the task of driving safely by referring to traffic and conversing about it . ) In fact , a separate University of Utah study found 18- to 25-year-olds who drive while talking on cell phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using phones . If you absolutely must make that call , your best bet is to pull over . 2 . Answer : B Anyone who 's experiencing chronic sleep disturbances - from shift workers to mothers of small children to employees who are working major overtime - is at increased risk for falling asleep behind the wheel , a condition that kills more than 1,550 people each year . Young people have the most " drowsy driving " crashes , which occur predominantly after midnight . In one study , drivers under 30 accounted for almost two-thirds of drowsy-driving crashes , despite representing only onefourth of licensed drivers , and young males are at five times the risk as young females , according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data . If you 're feeling bleary-eyed behind the wheel , the best remedy is not to attempt to fight fatigue with caffeine or by cracking a window . Instead , pull over at a safe spot and rest . 3 . Answer : B , A , C , D The deadliest day of the year to drive is July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1986-2002 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . There are an average of 161 crash deaths on July 4 , 12 more than on any other day , with a high number involving alcohol , researchers report . Surprisingly , the second worst day is n't New Year 's Day ( which ranks fifth ) , but rather July 3 , with 149 crash deaths . Six of the 10 deadliest driving days revolve around holidays : July 2-4 , Dec. 23 , Jan. 1 and Sept. 2 ( on or near Labor Day ) . The remaining four all occur in August , which has more road traffic than any other month . To stay safe during dangerous holiday periods - short of staying off the road - the American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety suggests a few common-sense precautions : Always keep a cab-company number in your wallet to call for a ride home if you 've had too much to drink ; and , if you 're hosting a party , offer your guests a variety of nonalcoholic drinks or a place to sleep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people tend to assume that sport utility vehicles are safer than cars because if " it 's big , it must be safe , ' ' " says Marc Ross , Ph.D. , a physicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . " That 's simply not true . " SUVs have a high ground clearance , making them less stable and more prone to rollovers , which , while uncommon , are also deadly . Rollovers make up just 2.5 percent of crashes , yet they account for a shocking one-third of occupant fatalities . Sedans , in contrast , have a much lower rollover risk , making them the safest vehicles in most cases . 5 . Answer : A You 'd think being stuck in holiday traffic in wintry conditions would bring out the Grinch in drivers , but it turns out most people are careful in crummy driving conditions . According to an AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety study , drivers ' expectations are lower during rainy , snowy and icy weather . Conversely , road rage is most likely to occur on Friday afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , most road-rage incidents occur in summer . Afternoon drivers are most likely to be fatigued and rushed , resulting in shorter tempers on the road , AAA researchers report . // Better law enforcement is helping to keep road-ragers in check , but to keep your own emotions under control , take deep breaths , do n't compete with other drivers and remember , whatever the slight or delay , it 's not worth dying over . 6 . Answer : B Home is where we tend to feel safest , but it 's also where most accidents happen . Twenty-three percent of car accidents occur within just a mile of home , and another 29 percent occur two to five miles from home . In fact , accidents are more than twice as likely to take place one mile from home compared with 20 miles from home , and only 1 percent of accidents happen 50 miles or more from home . Given these sobering stats , be sure to keep close attention to the road at all times . 7 . Answer : C The rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why it 's always recommended that children under 12 be secured in the back seat of the car . However , if you 're driving or riding in the front seat , you can make a couple of small adjustments to protect yourself in the event of a front-impact accident , which accounts for more than 50 percent of crashes . If you 're a passenger , slide your seat back as far as it will go ; if you 're the driver , maintain a distance of at least 10 inches from the wheel ( especially if you 're pregnant ) to minimize the potential of air-bag-related injuries . And , of course , always wear your seat belt . Air bags provide only supplemental protection in head-on crashes ; you can end up on top of them if you 're not wearing a seat belt . 8 . Answer : A ! OK , yes , women , like men , cause accidents . But research shows women are less likely to drive drunk or recklessly . Consumers on the whole are pretty reliable when responding to auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but research shows women lag behind men when it comes to regular vehicle upkeep : They 're less likely to have muffler repairs , oil changes , air filter replacements and transmission repairs . There may be a partial explanation for this . One survey reported that more than 90 percent of women said they believed they were treated differently at car-repair shops because of their gender . That 's no excuse to avoid the auto shop ; get a referral from a friend or family member and ask him or her to accompany you on the first visit to increase your comfort level .

Sidebar Pull over : Twentysomething drivers who talk on their cell phones have the same reaction time as 65-year-olds . Sidebar When driving , it 's safest to sit at least 10 inches away from the wheel . Sidebar TGIF ? Nope . That 's the day you 're most prone to road rage .
