<p> Towelie does n't have his own TV show , and that 's a TV crime . How can it be there is no 30-minute spinoff for " South Park 's " talking towel that gets stoned ? <p> Towelie asks , " You wan na get high ? " And when humans lambaste him with the observation , " You 're a towel , " he accuses them back , " YOU 'RE a towel ! " <p> Do n't think I 'm joking around . I would highly anticipate watching a " Towelie " comedy . I have other ideas for alternative series . I even have suggestions for time slots on networks . TV world , heed my wisdom and put these shows on the air . <p> ' RALPH ' <p> ( 8:30 p.m . Sundays on Fox , in place of " The War at Home " ) <p> " Simpsons " child Ralph Wiggum finally gets his own 30-minute cartoon . If you do n't know Ralph and his innocent empty-headedness , you 're life is not complete . " My cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail English ? That 's unpossible ! " " I bent my wookie . " We 're all missing out , without a weekly dose of " Ralph . " <p> ' THE SEDARISES ' <p> ( 9:30 p.m . Sundays on HBO , in place of " Extras " ) <p> Actress Amy Sedaris and writer David Sedaris portray a married couple . They 're brother and sister in real life , but they do n't kiss or anything . They play a long-wed pair , the wittiest duo on TV . They buy the Vermont inn from " Newhart " and turn it into an Algonquin Round Table getaway for ironic , artistic friends . Let the sarcasm bloom . <p> ' BLOOD HAS BEEN SHED , JERRY ' <p> ( 8 p.m . Sundays on ABC , in place of " Desperate Housewives " ) <p> Steve Buscemi is one of America 's great actors , to say the least , and despite looking like a regular Joe he has been able to win roles in superficial Hollywood . Now , in each TV episode , he portrays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk from " Tree 's Lounge , " the homeless guy from " Big Daddy , " the assassin from " Things To Do In Denver When You 're Dead , " Mr. Pink from " Reservoir Dogs " and obviously the guy who gets fed into the wood chipper in " Fargo . " TV executives , if you 're really interested in hiring movie-quality actors , Buscemi is your guy . <p> ' KARMA PENANCE : I 'M A TERRIBLE PARENT ' <p> ( 8 p.m . Mondays , ABC , in place of " Supernanny " ) <p> It 's comeuppance time for the worst stage parents alive : Britney Spears ' mom , Jessica Simpson 's dad , Michael Jackson 's papa and others who robbed today 's stars of yesterday 's youth . On this reality competition , each mom and dad raises money for Save the Children by working menial jobs  --  washing dishes in busy restaurants and turning petting-zoo manure into fertilizer . For winning , first place is a spatula . The loser must move to Haiti with no financial resources whatsoever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m . Wednesdays on ABC , in place of " According to Jim " ) <p> Will Arnett is magically ridiculous in a reprise of his role as dumb Gob in " Arrested Development , " in which he mucked everything up a lot and said , " My gut is telling me no  --  but my gut is also very hungry . " " Gobtacular " is a " Gong Show " - ish variety show , with backstage scenes , too , hosted by bad magician/bad ventriloquist Gob . David Cross and other ex- " Arrested " actors do walk-on guest parts . <p> ' STIFLER 'S MOM ' <p> ( 7 p.m . Mondays on CBS , in place of " King of Queens " ) <p> Jennifer Coolidge was hilarious as an empty-headed dog owner in " Best in Show . " But she may be best known as Stifler 's mom , bedding the young Finch in the " American Pie " comedies . I do n't like the " Pie " movies , but Coolidge could bring a Mrs. Robinson turn to the TV mom you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of my friend Dan Ochwat , but I stole it . ) <p> ' THE STEINFELDMAN CHRONICLES ' <p> ( 8 p.m . Fridays on the CW , in place of " Reba " ) <p> Four friends do a show about nothing in New York , starring four of the funniest comedians and actors out right now : Daniel Tosh , Mitch Fatel , Vince Vieluf and Greg Proops . I 'd add Sarah Silverman , but she 's getting ready to do a show for Comedy Central . <p> ' BERNIE AND WANDA FIGHT A LOT ' <p> ( 9:30 p.m . Sundays on HBO , in place of " Lucky Louie " ) <p> " The Bernie Mac Show " should n't have been canceled . And Wanda Sykes should have become a regular on " The New Adventures of Old Christine " and not just a guest star . But since both are free of TV commitments , HBO lets these two  --  some of America 's funniest actors  --  create a foul-mouthed , down-and-dirty sitcom more original than " Louie . " <p> ' FOX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HBO , to replace exiting " The Sopranos " ) <p> The plot ? As Uma Thurman explained in Quentin Tarantino 's " Pulp Fiction , " the show goes like this : " ' Fox , ' as in we 're a bunch of foxy chicks . ' Force , ' as in we 're a force to be reckoned with . ' Five , ' as in there 's one , two , three , four , five of us . There was a blonde one ... a Japanese one , a black one , a French one and a brunette one , me  --  all with special skills . Sommerset had a photographic memory , the Japanese fox was a kung fu master , the black girl was a demolition expert , the French fox 's speciality was sex . " Tarantino directs the first two-hour episode , as well as special-event episodes and finales , and he handpicks writers and directors to complete other episodes . <p> ' TOWELIE ' <p> ( 9 p.m . Mondays on Comedy Central , in place of " Blue Collar TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " South Park " towel with no value . He says in falsetto , " I 'm so high right now , I have no idea what 's going on . " But he is fantastically useless and funny , indignant and wimpy . Oh , how hard I laughed when he had to get high to remember the code to a security alarm , and when he typed it in , the button tones played " Funkytown . " <p> I need more Towelie in my life , more Ralph , more Wanda Sykes , more Tarantino .
