Not every endangered species is doomed . Thanks to tough laws , dedicated researchers , and plenty of money and effort , success stories abound <p> A CHEERFUL ENDANGERED SPECIES STORY ? It 's as rare as an ivory-billed woodpecker . Yet the recently reported sighting of this " ghost bird , " long believed extinct , has driven home the message that not all such stories end badly . So we looked for other animals that have made a comeback since Americans began protecting them in earnest a century ago . <p> In 1900 . Congress passed the Lacey Act , which prohibited interstate trade of wildlife taken illegally . Efforts to safeguard the nation 's natural heritage culminated in the 1973 Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) , signed into law by President Richard Nixon . It requires federal authorities to identify threatened or endangered animal and plant species and to help them recover , often by restricting how their habitats may be used . The ESA is supplemented by scores of conservation , hunting and antipollution laws , and the nation 's protected lands  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for 30 years the ESA has been the key to conservation . Today , more than 1,200 plants and animals are listed under the law as threatened or endangered , and thousands more are " species of concern . " <p> Now the Endangered Species Act itself is threatened . Because the ESA can restrict development , White House and Congressional critics charge that the law places the well-being of animals over that of people . Craig Hanson , a top Interior Department official , said in November 2003 that protecting endangered species is " not a priority . " Representative Richard Pombo ( R-CA ) , chair of the House Resources Committee , is drafting legislation that would blunt the law 's force by making it even more difficult to list a species as endangered . <p> ESA supporters protest that weakening the law would have a far-reaching impact . Scientists have only begun to understand how living things interact , and eliminating any one species can disrupt an entire community of living things . And it would be tragic to lose species , such as plants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study them . Without the ESA , advocates say , many species would join the passenger pigeon , the Eastern elk , the blue pike , the Santa Catalina monkey flower and the estimated 500 other species in the United States that have vanished in the past few hundred years , victims of overhunting , overharvesting or property development . As Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson has said , destroying plant and animal habitats and the untold diversity of life within them " is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive us . " <p> But what does it take to save a species ? We sent veteran environmental reporter Daniel Glick to investigate . Here , his ten success stories . Worth More Alive Than Dead HAWAIIAN GREEN SEA TURTLE TABLE <p> ON HAWAII 'S BIG ISLAND , marine biologist George Balazs seems to know most of the turtles by name-or at least by their markings and tags . He conducts what may be one of the longest continuous monitoring of any sea reptile , an effort of 34 years , and has presided over a cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular menu item , into a star of a multimillion-dollar tourist industry : But Balazs credits the giant reptile itself . " The honu touch your heart , " he says , using the Hawaiian word for turtle . " These turtles are their own best ambassadors . " <p> For decades , Hawaiians hunted the animals for their skin , which was turned into handbags , and their meat , a delicacy " In the 1970s , a turtle was a hundred dollar bill , " says Balazs . After he witnessed fishermen unloading a boat full of live green sea turtles bound for market in 1969 , he worried that the species would n't breed fast enough to sustain the demand . So he made an inventory of nesting female turtles at the animals ' main breeding site : the French Frigate Shoals , an atoll about 500 miles west of Hawaii in an area that had been designated a wildlife sanctuary by President Teddy Roosevelt in 1909 . In 1973 , his first year of fieldwork , Balazs counted a mere 67 nesting females , not enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being hunted . <p> Largely because of Balazs ' research and advocacy , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) in 1978 classified the Hawaiian green sea turtle as threatened under the ESA . Killing a honu became a federal offense . The green sea turtle made progress , despite its slow reproductive pace : females reach sexual maturity at an average age of 25 , and swim from Hawaii to their nesting grounds and back  --  a 1,000 mile round trip  --  every three or four years . ( In the 1980s , an outbreak of fibropapilloma , a mysterious disease that afflicts many turtle species , dealt the animals a setback , but the disease seems to be abating . ) Balazs estimates the number of nesting females has risen to over 400 annually  --  a sixfold increase since the early 1970s . This rebound stands in contrast to other sea turtle species , five of which  --  leatherback , loggerhead , Kemp 's ridley , olive ridley and hawksbill  --  remain endangered in all or part of their ranges around the world . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Island and Kauai , snorkeling tour operators , beachfront hotel owners and even wildlife art dealers recognized the enormous potential of turtle tourism . This particular " watchable wildlife , " like the boon in whale-watching tours and even programs to view wolves in Wyoming , underscores the truism that many once-hunted critters are worth more alive than dead . <p> On a residential stretch of beach in the Puako neighborhood on the Big Island , Balazs and a team of high-school students from the Hawaii Preparatory Academy spend the day capturing , measuring and tagging turtles taken from the turquoise waters . They 've tagged thousands of turtles over the past two decades . <p> Diane Campbell , who lives in the neighborhood , comes down to watch . " I love the honu , " she says . She is wearing a T-shirt with a picture of the turtle and a message : " In recent years their numbers have declined due to disease and the destruction of their native habitat . " Balazs asks if she purchased the shirt recently . <p> " No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I cheer every time I put it on . " More Than a Symbolic Victory BALD EAGLE TABLE <p> In 1782 , the Second Continental Congress incorporated the bald eagle into the first great seal of the United States as a symbol of " supreme power and authority . " Unlike the king 's England , where wildlife was the exclusive property of royalty , in this new nation wild animals belonged to all the people . <p> By the 1930s , the national symbol was in trouble . Bald eagles , once soaring over most of the country by the hundreds of thousands , had plummeted in number to an estimated 10,000 pairs by the 1950s . Hunting , land clearing and accidental poisoning ( eagles often ate toxic meat set out by ranchers to kill wolves and other predators ) contributed to the decline . In 1940 , Congress jumped to the fore with the Bald Eagle Protection Act , which acknowledged the scientific and political reasons to conserve the distinctive white-headed bird with a seven-foot wingspan . " The bald eagle is no longer a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals of freedom , " the law states . It prohibited the kilting of bald eagles for virtually any reason . <p> But the introduction of DDT in 1945 dealt the animal a critical blow . The pesticide , sprayed far and wide to eradicate mosquitoes and agricultural pests , crept into the food chain . Fish ate exposed bugs , eagles and other birds ate pesticide-laced fish , and the DDT ingested by the birds so thinned their eggshells that chicks could n't survive . By 1963 , only 417 bald eagle nesting pairs were found in the lower 48 . <p> In 1972 , ten years after Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring publicized the insidious threat of DDT , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned the pesticide . Still , the hunting and chemical regulations would not have been enough to revive the bald eagle . The passage of the ESA provided critical help by protecting the bird 's habitat . Other federal laws would also contribute . Efforts to decontaminate the Chesapeake Bay ; prompted by the Clean Water Act , benefited the eagle by slowly reducing harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection for the emblematic bird also made a difference . Eagle lovers monitored nests , educated the public and campaigned to close nesting areas during the breeding season . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) banned hunters from using lead shot nationwide , which can poison eagles and other raptors that scavenge waterfowl that have been struck by the shot . Meanwhile , the eagle itself adapted to living near people  --  even setting up nests a few miles from the U.S. Capitol . <p> In 1995 , wildlife authorities changed the bald eagle 's status from endangered to threatened , an important moment in conservation history Today , with about 7,678 pairs of bald eagles in the lower 48 , the bird awaits a final OK to be taken off the ESA 's threatened list , a move that many anticipate will come quickly " People want success , " says Jody Millar , Bald Eagle Monitoring Coordinator for the FWS , in Rock Island , Illinois . She says that the recovery of the beloved national symbol has generated public acceptance of conservation measures . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want it . " An Island Within an Island PALILA TABLE <p> PAUL BANKO walks along the arid slopes of the 13,796 - foot- high Mauna Kea volcano on Hawaii 's Big Island . He 's searching for a yellow-crowned songbird called the palila . He hears the trilled warble that gives the bird its onomatopoeic name , but he does n't actually see one . " Typical Hawaii birding experience , " Banko deadpans . For nearly two decades , Banko , a U.S. Geological Survey wildlife biologist , has sought to reverse the palila 's decline by working to restore its habitat and coaxing the birds to colonize another territory The bird , a type of Hawaiian honeycreeper , lives almost exclusively on seeds from the increasingly scarce mamane tree . <p> The state 's flora and fauna have long been vulnerable to habitat loss , invasive species , overharvesting and disease . Indeed , Hawaii is home to a quarter of all the United States ' animals and plants listed under the ESA , with more than 300 threatened or endangered species , more than 100 candidate species and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii 's native bird species have become extinct . <p> Human activity has devastated Hawaiian birds and other wildlife since Polynesians first settled the islands some 1,600 years ago . Stowaway rats that leapt from their canoes preyed on birds ' nests . Several species of flightless geese , prized as food , were extinguished . Other birds were culled for their plumage , and Hawaiian kings cleared forests for agriculture . Europeans , arriving in the late 18th century , brought mosquitoes that Rater transmitted avian pox and malaria , against which native songbirds had little resistance . Introduced sheep , pigs , cats and cattle compacted soils , ate mamane seedlings or devoured nestlings . Ranchers cleared forests for cattle pastures . Mongooses were imported to control the rats , but because mongooses hunt during the day , when rats hide , the mongooses ate ground-nesting birds instead . The palila vanished from the islands of Kauai and Oahu probably before 1800 . <p> Hawaii 's endangered species experience is instructive , Banko says , because the destruction and fragmentation of habitats as well as the domination of native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' decline . " We see this as a microcosm of what 's happening on the continent in terms of watching ecological processes unravel , " he says . The process is just more obvious on a real island than on one of the ecological islands that increasingly occur on the mainland  --  isolated habitats surrounded by highways , strip malls and housing developments . <p> The palila was one of the first species to be protected under the ESA when an early version of the law passed in 1966 . Still , state authorities did little until 1978 when the palila did what any red-blooded American bird would do : it sued . In Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources ( the first time a bird was a plaintiff in a lawsuit , which was brought by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund ) , a federal court ruled that under the ESA , the state had to prevent further damage to the bird 's habitat . In the 1990s , when the U.S. Army proposed building a road through critical palila habitat , the ESA dictated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration projects . <p> By then , most palila were confined to a 12-square-mile forest on the west slope of Manna Kea , between 7,000 and 9,000 feet . This lone population of about 3,000 birds easily could have been wiped out by fire , storms or a disease that strikes mamane trees . With the military 's mitigation money , Banko and co-workers set out to expand the palila 's existing forest and establish a new palila population on Mauna Kea 's north side . <p> Banko and others netted palila on the west slope , equipped them with tiny radio transmitters and moved them to the north slope . Most of the birds simply flew the 12 miles home . This past March , however , the researchers relocated another 75 wild palila , and some appear to have stayed put . At the same time , Alan Lieberman , of the Zoological Society of San Diego 's Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species , along with his colleagues at Hawaii 's Keanhou Bird Conservation Center , have bred palila in captivity and released 15 of the birds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieberman says , the survivors appear to be acting like wild palila , and at least one pair is mating . <p> On Mauna Kea 's north side , Banko walks around a forest of 20-foot-high mamane mixed with an occasional koa and sandalwood tree . Over a hand-held radio , he receives a report from one of his field researchers : there are five palila in a tree half a mile away . The tree stands in the middle of what the researchers have dubbed " palila paradise , " where they 've spotted 20 of the birds . " I think the palila will colonize this area , " Banko says , but he acknowledges it might take decades to build a community that wo n't need to be supplemented with captive-bred or relocated birds . He spots a female palila flitting in and out of the mamane tree . Everybody spies her activity through binoculars . After a few minutes , it 's obvious what she is doing : building a nest . A Clown Makes a Comeback SOUTHERN SEA OTTER TABLE <p> HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the Bering Strait to Russia and Japan . The animal was thought to have been eliminated from the California coast in the early 20th century despite a 1911 international treaty that protected sea otters from the fur trade . In 1938 , biologists made a startling announcement almost like that of the recent ivory-billed woodpecker 's rediscovery : up to several hundred animals were living near Big Sur . With that news , a rocky conservation success story began unfolding . <p> Over the next four decades , in the absence of hunting pressures , the sea otter population in California climbed to approximately 1,800 . But the otters faced new problems , including oil spills and some commercial fishermen who considered the otters competition ( they are voracious eaters ) and killed them . Commercial gill net fishing , a practice akin to dropping a curtain into the water and capturing almost anything that swims by , kilned an estimated 1,000 sea otters between 1973 and 1983 . <p> The otter 's tale provides a lesson in why species protection is so urgent . Plants and animals in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknowable ways ; the disappearance of a species can set off a cascade of problems . Take the sea otter in Alaska . Research biologist Jim Estes of the USGS Biological Resources Division suspects that overharvesting of whales in the Aleutian Islands in the 1990s prompted orcas , which eat other whales , to venture closer to shore and prey on sea lions , harbor seals and sea otters . As sea otters dwindled , one of their key foods , sea urchins , boomed . Sea urchins graze on kelp , so kelp forests declined . Without the kelp , crabs , clams , sea stars and many fish species suffered . In California , the decline of sea otters due to hunting and lost habitat had a similar outcome . <p> The southern sea otter of central California has been helped by the ESA and other laws , including 1980s regulations that moved gill net fishing farther offshore . In the late 1980s , a small Otter population was relocated to an island off the coast to ensure a separate , distinct colony as a hedge against a calamitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 2,500 California sea otters between Half Moon Bay and Santa Barbara , and the population appears stable . Sea urchins there are returning to normal , and kelp forests are thriving . Who 's Your Mommy ? WHOOPING CRANE TABLE <p> ONE OF THE MOST AUDACIOUS endangered species recovery efforts starts at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland , between Baltimore and Washington , D.C. There , researchers breed whooping cranes and prepare them for life in the wild . That might sound simple , but the project uses special effects worthy of George Lucas . Even before a bird hatches , researchers subject the egg to recordings of a roaring motor , to accustom a fetal bird to the sound of its foster parent-an ultralight aircraft . Once the birds hatch , they 're fed by crane puppets , and the people working with the chicks cover themselves in shapeless white sacks to prevent the birds from growing attached to humans . As the baby whoopers grow , they are taught to follow an ultralight equipped with a puppet crane head while a costumed pilot drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cranes are ready for the next step , at about 6 weeks of age , biologists ship them by private jet to the Necedah Wildlife Refuge in Wisconsin . There , the chicks learn to fly along after their aircraft parents . When it 's time to migrate , the young cranes follow the ultralight to their wintering home , in Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge in Florida ( along the way , the plane stops at different private and public properties to allow the birds to eat and rest ) . " We show them the way once , " says Heather Ray , who used to work for the group that runs the crane project , Operation Migration . After that , she insists , despite their odd upbringing , " these are wild birds . " <p> The whooping crane , like the black-footed ferret in the Great Plains and the California condor , is inching back from the precipice of extinction . In 1941 the species vied with the ivory-billed woodpecker for the title of North America 's most endangered bird . Only 21 whooping cranes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wetlands loss and fashion ( their plumes topped ladies ' hats ) . Conservationists were eager to revive the species , but they did n't know where to start : nobody knew exactly where migratory whooping cranes nested . Then , in 1954 , firefighters found whooping cranes at the Wood Buffalo National Park in the Northwest Territories in Canada . Recovery efforts for this migrating bird with a seven-foot wingspan now had a multinational twist . A Canadian-American team created a new migration route for the birds from Wisconsin to Florida ( there is also a nonmigratory whooping crane population , in Florida ) to supplement the cranes ' historic route from Canada to Texas , reasoning that bad weather or other problems along the single route could wipe out too many cranes . <p> By now , the whooping crane recovery program has used virtually every trick in the conservation biologists ' toolbox : captive breeding , intensive training of nestlings , international cooperation , partnerships between government and conservation groups , habitat conservation and great gobs of public and private money . <p> Last July ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild , including captive-bred birds that have now made the migration without a motorized escort . Though still endangered , the species has come a long way from its double-digit nadir . " If we can save the whooping crane , " she adds , " we can save all the other species . " The achievement , she adds , is " the wildlife equivalent of putting a man on the moon . " Safe Harbors on Private Land RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER TABLE <p> IN THE EARLY 1990s , while environmentalists and loggers in the Pacific Northwest battled over the northern spotted owl , sentiment was running high in the Southeast over the red-cockaded woodpecker ( RCW ) . The medium-sized bird nests in mature longleaf pine forests , which have been heavily logged since the 19th century . After it was listed as endangered in 1970 , some private landowners from the Carolinas to Mississippi deliberately cut longleaf pine trees to prevent the bird from squatting on their land . One driver 's personalized license plate read " I eat RCWs . " <p> The question of what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers . Some property owners have opposed species conservation efforts because of concerns that they 'll have to restrict commercial activities if an endangered species is identified on their land . The conflict over the woodpecker inspired a new approach to the problem , a cooperative agreement called Safe Harbor : if landowners agreed to help protect and restore a listed species , the federal government would waive particular ESA restrictions . <p> The first signatory of the agreement to save the red-cockaded woodpecker , perhaps the most successful Safe Harbor arrangement in the program 's ten years , was the Pinehurst Resort ( site of the 2005 U.S. Open ) in North Carolina , which agreed to replant longleaf pines and log their private forest holdings near the resort with selective-cutting rather than clear-cutting . In return , U.S. wildlife officials agreed that Pinehurst and other landowners would not be subject to increased limits on development . <p> The Safe Harbor agreement , like other conservation measures , did n't succeed on its own . Biologists fostered the regrowth of longleaf pines by burning competing undergrowth . And they constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve as suitable nesting cavities until forests matured . Today , the red-cockaded woodpecker population is an estimated 15,000 . <p> Moral ? " We 've got to make landowners allies in species conservation , " says Colin Rowan of Environmental Defense , a group that helped forge the Safe Harbor concept . More than 320 private landowners are enrolled in the Safe Harbor program , contributing to the protection of 35 threatened and endangered species on more than three million acres . Tinkering With Dams CALIFORNIA WINTER RUN CHINOOK SALMON TABLE <p> SALMON RUNS have dropped precipitously along the Pacific Coast  --  victims of dams , waterway diversions and riverside habitat destruction . But along the Sacramento River in California , winter chinook salmon runs have grown from a low of just 186 fish in 1994 to more than 10,000 this past winter . <p> In this case , the salmon 's decline can be linked to too much concrete . In 1945 , Shasta Dam in Northern California shortened the length of river accessible to salmon , forcing the fish to spawn farther downstream . Next , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles below the Shasta , near Redding , started blocking salmon from migrating up or down the river . Then , during a drought , Shasta Dam released warm water into the river in the summers of 1976 and 1977 , to keep the streams flowing . The outcome for baby chinook was predictable : the fry fried . <p> In 1985 , scientists petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service to classify the fish as endangered . NMFS officials ruled that although the fish was decidedly in trouble , a formal listing under the ESA was n't necessary An Earthjustice attorney sued . While the case was pending on appeal , in 1990 , U.S. officials classified the California winter run salmon as threatened . <p> Yet chinook populations in the Sacramento River continued to drop , and after another petition the fish was reclassified as endangered in 1994 . The ESA then mandated , among other engineering changes , that Shasta Dam operators install a device that would pump deeper  --  and thus colder  --  water into the river . The ESA listing also compelled the federal government to clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain Mine near Redding , which had been contributing to salmon deaths by leaching heavy metals into the river . All told , federal and state agencies have spent more than $200 million to revive the salmon 's winter run . Not Glamorous , but Protected KARNER BLUE BUTTERFLY TABLE <p> THE KARNER BLUE BUTTERFLY once lived in 12 Eastern and Midwestern states and the province of Ontario , Canada . But as agriculture and development destroyed its prime habitats , including oak savanna and pine barrens , its numbers declined across its range by 99 percent or more . <p> The federal government declares species endangered , but subsequent recovery efforts draw on state and local agencies as well as federal ones , along with conservation organizations and private landowners . In Wisconsin , the heart of the Karner blue 's range , the entire state helped bring this fluttering species back . Today , 38 different partners participate in a sweeping conservation plan that takes into account the butterfly 's life history . When the caterpillars hatch in spring and summer , they require fields of lupine for food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mow grass along its power lines later in the summer than usual , to give Karner blue caterpillars time to metamorphose into butterflies and fly away The state highway department and other partner organizations also mow late , add they leave the grass long at the end of the growing season to help butterfly eggs survive the winter . Forestry companies and other partners delay herbicide add pesticide spraying on their lands until the fall , after lupine and other plants have died . " We will lose this species if we do n't have institutionalized management , " says Cathy Carnes , endangered species coordinator with the FWS in Wisconsin . <p> Restoration of the insect 's habitat appears to be a boon to other scarce animals that share it , such as the endangered Kirtland 's warbler ( which breeds in Michigan but visits Wisconsin ) , the slender glass lizard , the eastern massasauga rattlesnake and the wood turtle . <p> To be sure , charismatic , symbolic or particularly cute endangered species often receive the lion 's share of public attention and money , but the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals or insects like the Karner blue . The butterfly will never stir people 's hearts quite like a bald eagle does , but its ESA listing prompted enough changes that the Karner blue stands a good chance of surviving . " We still have time to preserve what we have left , " says Carnes . Sharing Water During a Drought CHIRICAHUA LEOPARD FROG TABLE <p> ARIZONA RANCHERS Matt and Anna Magoffin earned an unofficial nomination to the Endangered Species Hall of Fame by hauling a thousand gallons of water per week to a stock tank on their ranch for four years , all to save a frog on its last legs . <p> Many Southwestern aquatic species have suffered in the past century . Invasive species have altered the desert habitat , fungal diseases have hit frogs and other amphibians , and ranching and the Sun Belt population boom have diverted water , disrupted river and stream habitats and destroyed seasonal watering holes . The Magoffins are part of a coalition called the Malpai Borderlands Group , which created a Safe Harbor agreement for the Chiricahua leopard frog after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the frogs have disappeared from 75 percent Of their historic range , and today the frog population is at or near its lowest point ever . To help the frog , the Magoffin family rebuilt water tanks , put in wells , poured concrete ponds and moved tadpoles from drought-stricken pools to more reliable water sources . <p> Biologist Jim Rorabaugh of the FWS in Phoenix credits the Magoffins with paving the way for frog conservation on the one million acres where the Malpai Borderlands Group is active . Most of that land is public , controlled by Arizona , New Mexico , the U.S. Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management , but much of it is owned privately by ranchers . <p> " We 're a long way from recovering this species , " says Rorabaugh . " But we 've got some really good partnerships on the ground . " Life With a Top Predator GRIZZLY BEAR TABLE <p> " WELCOME to Grizzly Country . " The sign is at the entrance to the squat , concrete building that houses the Cody district office of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency 's bear management officer , says he 's trying to " keep the peace between people and bears . " <p> Grizzlies once roamed a vast swath of the Great Plains and Western states , but now occur only in isolated populations in Montana , Idaho , Washington and Wyoming . ( They 're doing fine in Alaska . ) By the early 1970s , hunting and development pressures caused the grizzly population in the Yellowstone area to plunge to about 150 bears , many of which were raiding trash bins in the national park . In 1975 , officials classified the species as threatened in the lower 48 . <p> Today ; Yellowstone and its surrounding area , most of which is national forest land , is home to more than 600 bears , and the FWS is considering taking the grizzly off the threatened species list . It is " the wildlife recovery success story of the century , " Bruscino says . Not that it was easy . The great bear is slow to reproduce , reaching sexual maturity at 4 to 5 years of age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five years . And grizzlies require great expanses of wild country to make a living . <p> One important factor in the grizzly 's rebound has been teaching people how to live with bears . That means keeping the animals away from humans so rangers or others do n't relocate or shoot them . Near Cody , east of Yellowstone National Park , an eight-foot-high bear-proof fence protects a small schoolhouse . Some ranchers take their cow carcasses to the county dump rather than leaving them to attract ursine scavengers . ( The state of Wyoming has reimbursed ranchers more than $500,000 since 1995 for livestock losses . ) Before a dumpster can be certified as " bear-resistant , " a 900-pound captive grizzly pounds away at a prototype filled with peanut butter and cookies . People put up electric fences around beehives ( bears do love honey ) and learn how to behave in a grizzly 's presence ( never look them in the eye , back away slowly ) . <p> The long-term prognosis for the Yellowstone bears is cloudy . Genetic inbreeding may hamper this population 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer threatened will open the Yellowstone area to increased oil , gas and residential development , which would fragment the grizzly 's habitat even more and hamper , if not undo , the bears ' progress . <p> Chris Servheen , the grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the FWS , says the bears have come back largely because people are n't killing them as much as they used to : " The most important habitat for bears is in the human heart .
