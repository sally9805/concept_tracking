De-lovely . Such an insouciant and enticing neologism , so perfectly emblematic of Cole Porter , the man who coined it . You enter a movie with that title , prepared to be enchanted . You straggle out a couple of hours later , lost in a fog of gloom . For this film 's makers grimly insist that the songwriter 's life was essentially a betrayal of his impeccably sophisticated art when they might have more profitably seen his work as a gallant triumph over the difficulties of a messy life . <P> De-Lovely proceeds from a miscalculated device . A nameless shade ( Jonathan Pryce ) arrives to conduct the aged , crippled Porter ( Kevin Kline ) out of this world into the next . Before they depart , they naturally pause to contemplate Porter 's 73 years of existence . His homosexuality is not elided . His tense and enigmatic marriage to Linda Lee Thomas ( Ashley Judd ) is inconclusively examined . So is the riding accident that crushed both his legs and put him in constant , searing pain and ( this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last quarter-century of his life . <P> This is serious material , and you can not blame serious filmmakers  --  the movie was written by Jay Cocks ( formerly a TIME critic ) and directed by Irwin Winkler , producer of some of the best movies ( Raging Bull , The Right Stuff ) of recent times  --  for being seduced by it . But something goes terribly wrong in the execution . Kline suggests Porter 's intractable snootiness but none of his perpetually boyish elan . Judd mostly simpers . The Porters had , it seems , a marriage of inconvenience , leavened in the movie by glam settings , the irrelevant appearances of famous people and , of course , the tunes Porter is occasionally seen dashing off . <P> The immortal love songs and list songs are rendered by such pop stars as Alanis Morissette , Sheryl Crow and Robbie Williams . They are supposed to bring in the younger crowd , for whom Porter is either antiquated or anonymous . But there 's little they can do to lift the pall of joylessness that hangs over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic  --  is what Cole Porter was all about , whatever tests and traumas he endured .
