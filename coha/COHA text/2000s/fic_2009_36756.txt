Chapter Four <p> " As you can see , Your Highness , " said Lieutenant General Aedelas Blackmoore , " the taxes have been put to good use . Every precaution has been taken in the operation of this facility . In fact , security is so tight we 've been able to stage gladiatorial combat here . " <p> " So I 've heard , " said Arthas , as he walked with the commander of the internment camps on a tour of the grounds . Durnholde , not an internment camp itself , but the nerve center of all of the others , was huge , and indeed had almost a festival air about it . It was a crisp but bright autumn day , and the breeze caused the blue and white banners that flew over the keep to snap energetically . The wind stirred Blackmoore 's long raven hair and tugged at Arthas 's cloak as they strolled along the ramparts . <p> " And so you shall also see , " Blackmoore promised , giving his prince an ingratiating grin . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terenas had praised Arthas for his initiative and compassion . " It 's only right , Father , " Arthas had said , and by and large he meant it , although his primary reason for the suggestion was to satisfy his curiosity about the pet orc the lieutenant general kept . " We should make sure the money is going into the camps and not Blackmoore 's pocket . We can ascertain if he is taking proper care of the gladiatorial participants  --  and also , make sure he is not walking the path of his father . " <p> Blackmoore 's father , General Aedelyn Blackmoore , had been a notorious traitor , tried and convicted of selling state secrets . While his crimes had taken place long ago , when his son had been but a child , the stain had dogged Aedelas throughout his military career . It was only his record of victory in battles , and particular ferocity in fighting the orcs , that had enabled the current Blackmoore to rise in the ranks . Still , Arthas could detect the smell of liquor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . He suspected that particular piece of information would not be news to Terenas , but he 'd make sure he told his father anyway . <p> Arthas looked down , feigning interest in watching the dozens of guards who stood at rigid attention . He wondered if they were that attentive when their future king was n't watching them . <p> " I look forward to the bout today , " he said . " Will I be able to watch your Thrall in action ? I 've heard quite a bit about him . " <p> Blackmoore grinned , his neatly trimmed goatee parting to reveal white teeth . " He was not scheduled to fight today , but for you , Your Highness , I shall pair him up against the worthiest foes available . " <p> Two hours later , the tour was complete , and Arthas shared a delicious meal with Blackmoore and a younger man named Lord Karramyn Langston , whom Blackmoore introduced as " my protTgT . " Arthas took an instinctive dislike to Langston , noting the man 's soft hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle for his title ; this boy  --  Arthas thought of him as a boy , although in truth Langston was older than Arthas 's seventeen years  --  had been handed everything on a platter . <p> Well , so have I , he thought , but he also knew what sacrifices a king would be expected to make . Langston looked like he 'd never denied himself a thing in his life . Nor did he deny himself now , helping himself to the choicest cuts of meat , the most lavish pastries , and more than one glass of wine to wash it down with . Blackmoore , in contrast , ate sparingly , though he had more alcohol than Langston . <p> Arthas 's dislike of the pair was completed when their serving girl entered and Blackmoore reached to touch her in a proprietary manner . The girl , golden-haired and simply clad , with a face that needed no artifice to be beautiful , smiled as if she enjoyed it , but Arthas caught a quick flash of unhappiness in her blue eyes . <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still caressing the girl 's arm as she gathered the plates . " Daughter of my personal servant , Tammis , whom I 'm sure you 'll see later . " <p> Arthas gave the girl his most winning smile . She reminded him a bit of Jaina  --  her hair brightened by the sun , her skin tanned . She returned the smile fleetingly , then demurely looked away as she gathered the plates , dropping a quick curtsey before leaving . <p> " You 'll have one like that soon enough , lad , " Blackmoore said , laughing . It took Arthas a second to grasp the meaning and then he blinked , startled . The two men laughed harder , and Blackmoore raised his goblet in a toast . <p> " To fair-haired girls , " he said , in a purring voice . Arthas looked back at Taretha , thought of Jaina , and forced himself to raise his glass . <p> An hour later Arthas had forgotten all about Taretha Foxton and his indignation on her behalf . His voice was raw from screaming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of his life . <p> At first , he 'd felt a little uncomfortable . The first few combatants in the ring were simple beasts pitted against one another , fighting to the death for no reason other than the enjoyment of the onlookers . " How are they treated prior to this ? " Arthas had asked . He was fond of animals ; it unsettled him to see them used so . <p> Langston had opened his mouth , but Blackmoore shushed him with a quick gesture . He had smiled , leaning back in his chaise lounge and snagging a bunch of grapes . " Well of course we want them at their fighting peak , " he said . " So they are captured and treated quite well . And as you can see , the bouts go quickly . If an animal survives and is not able to continue fighting again , we put him down at once , mercifully . " <p> Arthas hoped the man was not lying to him . A sick feeling in his gut told him Blackmoore probably was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fighting involved men against the beasts . As he watched , riveted , Blackmoore said , " The men are paid well . They in fact become minor celebrities . " <p> Not the orc , though . And Arthas knew it , and approved . That 's what he was waiting for  --  the chance to see Blackmoore 's pet orc , found as an infant and raised to be a fighter in these rings , in combat . <p> He was not disappointed . Apparently , everything up until now had been a warm-up for the crowd . When the doors creaked open and a huge green shape strode forward , everyone stood , roaring . Somehow Arthas found himself among them . <p> Thrall was enormous , appearing even larger because he was obviously so much healthier and alert than the other specimens Arthas had seen in the camps . He wore little armor and no helm , and green skin stretched tightly over powerful muscle . Too , he stood straighter than others . The cheering was deafening , and Thrall walked a circle around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to be showered with rose petals usually reserved for holidays . <p> " I taught him to do that , " Blackmoore said with pride . " It 's an odd thing , really . The crowd cheers for him , yet they come hoping every time he 'll get beaten . " <p> " Has he ever lost a bout ? " <p> " Never , Your Highness . Nor will he . Yet people keep hoping , and the money keeps flowing . " <p> Arthas eyed him . " As long as the royal coffers see their proper percentage of your earnings , Lieutenant General , you 'll be permitted to continue the games . " He turned again to the orc , watching him as he completed his circuit . " He ... is completely under control , is n't he ? " <p> " Absolutely , " Blackmoore said immediately . " He was raised by humans and taught to fear and respect us . " <p> As if he had heard the comment , though he could not possibly have done so over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthas , Blackmoore , and Langston sat watching . He thumped his chest in a salute and then bowed deeply . <p> " You see ? Utterly my creature , " Blackmoore purred . He rose and lifted a flag , waving it , and across the ring a solidly built red-haired man waved another flag . Thrall turned toward the door , gripping the massive battle axe that was his weapon in this bout . <p> The guards began to raise the door , and before it had even opened fully , a bear the size of Invincible surged forward . Its hackles had risen and it barreled straight for Thrall as if it had been launched from a cannon , its snarl audible even over the roar of the crowd . <p> Thrall held his ground , stepping aside at the absolute last minute and bringing the huge axe around as if it weighed nothing at all . It tore a great rent in the bear 's side , and the animal roared in maddened pain , whirling and sending blood spattering . Again , the orc stood his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he moved with a speed that belied his size . He met the bear head-on , shouting taunts in a guttural voice in perfect Common , and brought the axe crunching down . The bear 's head was nearly severed from its neck , but it kept running for a few moments before toppling into a quivering heap . <p> Thrall threw back his head and cried out his victory . The crowd went mad . Arthas stared . <p> There was n't a scratch on the orc , and as far as Arthas could tell , the brute was n't even particularly winded . <p> " That 's just the opener , " Blackmoore said , smiling at Arthas 's reaction . " Next will be three humans attacking him . He 's also hampered by the fact that he 's not to kill them , just defeat them . More a strategic battle than one of brute force , but I confess , there 's something about watching him decapitate a bear in a single blow that always makes me proud . " <p> Three human gladiators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saluted their opponent and the crowd . Arthas watched as Thrall sized them up and wondered just how smart it was of Blackmoore to make his pet orc so damn good at fighting . If Thrall ever escaped , he could teach those skills to other orcs . <p> It was possible , despite the increased security . After all , if Orgrim Doomhammer could escape from the Undercity , in the very heart of the palace , Thrall could escape from Durnholde. * * * <p> The state visit lasted five days . During one of those days , late in the evening , Taretha Foxton came to visit the prince in his private quarters . He was puzzled that his servants did not answer the tentative knock on the door and was even more startled to see the pretty blond girl standing there carrying a tray of delicacies . Her eyes were downcast , but her dress was revealing enough that he did n't speak immediately . <p> She dropped a curtsey . " My lord Blackmoore sent me with this offering of things to tempt you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was confused . <p> " I  --  tell your master thank you , although I am not hungry . And I 'm wondering what he 's done with my servants . " <p> " They have been invited to a repast with the other servants , " Taretha explained . She still did n't look up . <p> " I see . Well , that 's kind of the lieutenant general ; I 'm sure the men appreciate it . " <p> She did n't move . <p> " Is there anything else , Taretha ? " <p> The pink in her cheeks deepened , and she lifted her eyes to him . They were calm , resigned . " My lord Blackmoore sent me with this offering of things to tempt you , " she repeated . " Things you might enjoy . " <p> Understanding burst upon him then . Understanding , and embarrassment , and irritation , and anger . He composed himself with an effort  --  it was hardly the girl 's fault , indeed , she was the one being ill used . <p> " Taretha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , with thanks . I need nothing else . " <p> " Your Highness , I 'm afraid he will insist . " <p> " Tell him I said it 's fine . " <p> " Sir , you do n't understand . If I come back he  --  " <p> He glanced down at the hands holding the tray , at the long hair draped just so . Arthas stepped forward and lifted her trailing hair out of the way , frowning at the brownish-blue fading marks on her wrists and throat . <p> " I see , " he said . " Come inside , then . " Once she had entered , he closed the door and turned to her . <p> " Stay for as long as you feel comfortable , then go back to him . In the meantime , I ca n't possibly eat all this . " He gestured for her to sit and took a chair opposite her , snagging a small pastry and grinning . <p> Taretha blinked at him . It took a moment for her to understand what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her face as she poured the wine . After a little while , she began to respond to his questions with more than a few polite words , and they spent the next few hours talking before they agreed it was time for her to return . As she picked up the tray , she turned to him . <p> " Your Highness  --  it pleases me so much to know that the man who will be our next king has such a kind heart . The lady you choose to make your queen will be a very lucky woman . " <p> He smiled and closed the door behind her , leaning on it for a moment . <p> The lady he would choose to make his queen . He recalled his conversation with Calia ; fortunately for his sister , Terenas had started to have some suspicions about Prestor  --  nothing that could be proven , but enough for second thoughts . <p> Arthas was almost of age  --  a year older than Calia had been when their father had nearly betrothed her to Prestor . He supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later . <p> Tomorrow he would be leaving , and not a minute too soon . <p> 2009 Blizzard Entertainment , Inc <br> Continues ...
