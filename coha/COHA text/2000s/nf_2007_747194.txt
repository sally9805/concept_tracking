Musicians , like Joshua Cohen 's title character , have always been a skeptical bunch and may consider any claim to " literary virtuosity " humdum . Perhaps when you 're practicing ten hours a day every day there 's simply little that will raise an eyebrow . Though if it 's still possible for any musician to be impressed by the virtuosity of any 25-year-old writer , perhaps Joshua Cohen deserves the nod . His first novel , Cadenza , for the Schneidermann Violin Concerto , is a wild , wide-ranging , freewheeling and ultimately lonely work that speaks to the most crucial aspirations of literary fiction 's much-maligned " experimental " genre . <p> Cadenza 's plot is simple : violin virtuoso Laster , onstage at Carnegie Hall , has just completed playing the first movement of his friend ( and mentor ) Schneidermann 's last composition ; he is now poised to begin a solo . Instead , he calls off the entire orchestra , and lifts his own voice into a tirade that lasts until morning . He offers his chair-bound audience not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of Schneidermann 's European flight , his interactions with the world of Judaism , and the bemoaning of the fortunes of high culture in general ( to say nothing of the encyclopedic delineating of some of the finer points of musical history and theory ) . <p> But plot is not the principal objective in Cadenza . Granted , the book 's prose is not nearly as confrontational or focused as the lines of Ginsburg 's Howl ( perhaps its closest literary parallel ) ; the political nihilism of the poem is supplanted by solipsism , remorse , and acid wit . But if it is a world more imaginatively enclosed , it is also one admirably demarcated . Cohen is an observer not of human beings , but of the ideas that human beings have surrounded themselves inside : " Good evening , Mr. President of this house soon to fall . Take a seat , you own them all . " From the podium , the Carnegie Hall patrons appear fixed in their seats , radiating glares in the direction of the novel 's narrator . Laster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup and hair homosexual , " his " grandson who he fixes my electronic devices and gets them to blink and chirp like new . " These broadsides provide an easy lever with which to turn the axle of black wit , which , after a brief introductory struggle , soon begins spinning perpetually , as evidenced by the bombardment of the " communist concertmaster " who leaves the auditorium early on : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> As far as I can recall , no one exits after this point . <p> It may be easy to depict the over-talented , under-appreciated artist as a crank . What 's impressive about Laster 's conceits is not their psychological depth , but their scope . Michael Jackson and Handel arc considered equally parasitic ; white Americans of European descent have apparently given nothing to further the course of serious music . Even jazz can not escape the shadow of his scorn ( though it takes Laster a few more sentences to do away with it ) . <p> Laster is no mere prankster ; his continual reflection and goading of the crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts , suggests the relentless energy and stamina necessary for virtuosity , as well as the fragile control any individual wields over that virtuosity . Seen in this light , Laster 's attacks become more like a defense mechanism : he 's genuinely worried that his audience will grow tired and disperse before he has finished . That the aesthetic premise behind the tirade relies on an obscure improvisational technique - the cadenza - of a dying art only heightens his anxiety . There is torture in Laster 's voice , and there is something clearly tragic in his failed conclusion . His wish for death does n't reveal the exhaustion of his subject material ; he 's simply exhausted himself physically . <p> At the same time his confrontations , unabashed intellectualism , and bold , rough strokes arc a tonic for a literary era that finds a backlog of writers who bend language timidly or without reason . The literary " underground " has long since calcified into a niche-marketed shell ; " serious " fiction now too easily retreats behind foggy academic windows before baring its teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the utility of experimental writing relied , as R.M. Berry recently indicated , on the rewording of arguments from the 1960s . Simply put : it 's all so damn predictable . <p> While delineation of this " predictability " would tax the patience of any reader , perhaps it 's enough to say that , in an increasingly closed world , the 20th-century " antihero " is no longer capable of assuaging our anxieties . Now it 's perhaps the " antitragic " character that suggests exploration - the cantankerous protagonist of an enclosed , delineated landscape from which matter may be destroyed or reformed , but not recreated . Many great books ( including Pynchon 's ) embody this ideal . But what distinguishes Cadenza from postmodern irony is the genuine compassion an observer will feel for Laster , despite his insistence on being both instrument and executor of his own destruction . From our confusion over Laster 's arcane references we infer , perhaps more accurately than he ever can , that the death of " serious " music is fast upon us . He may decry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he may be wrong to do so . But it 's equally unsettling to think that we 're unable to talk about the centuries of classical music with the same familiarity and precision which we do the 20-year-old universe of The Simpsons . Thus , Mr. President , the entire house is soon to fall . And when it docs , a significant piece of our definition of virtuosity will fall with it . Surrounded by a glut of unnecessary information , we come to realize that it 's important for cranks like Laster , and the traditions they carry forward from their small back rooms , to exist . <p> The " point " of literary experimentation may be debatable , and any debate taking place in a pragmatically-minded country is destined to end up in a bad place . But there are a few of us who remain entertained by the genre ; in no small part , I think , because of experimental writing 's principal objective is fundamentally disruptive ; it prevents more obvious modes of storytelling from calcifying into complacent formulas , by cracking them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is contemporary " experimentation " best envisaged as an isotope of the classic tragic paradox of concentrated effort and fateful finish ? Perhaps so . After all , the spiritual distance between Laster 's monologue and George W. Bush 's overseas exploits is none too wide : both promote a dying ideal with such singular gusto , they almost make one forget it 's dying until the very end . Laster 's voice will often feel strange ; his train of thought often curves too sharply to follow . But the impression of his gaze is as unavoidable and inevitable as the tragedy awaiting his cadenza 's finale . <p> By Miles Newbold Clark <p>
