<p>  --  When Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman arrives in Houston for the NBA 's All-Star Weekend on Friday as the guest of Commissioner David Stern , they will make an unlikely union : Goodman , the flamboyant politician known for parading around town with scantily clad showgirls , hanging out with Stern , the conservative league baron known for instituting a business casual dress code before the season began . <p> But Goodman and Stern are slowly becoming buddies ever since the NBA announced that Las Vegas will host the 56th All-Star Game in 2007 . That the NBA picked Las Vegas  --  where slot machines , blackjack tables and point spreads reign  --  as host of the league 's largest marketing and promotional event marks a considerable shift for an image-conscious commissioner who has always attempted to distance himself from unsavory perceptions of his league . <p> Stern , however , said that in his search for a destination city for the all-star game , Las Vegas was the perfect location . " I recognize its wonderful attributes in terms of entertaining visitors , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every game played , Las Vegas has long been viewed , as the forbidden fruit of professional sports , but that image appears to be beginning to fall . With the stigma surrounding gambling fading in recent years  --  with state lotteries , casinos on Native American reservations , Internet gambling , video poker and fantasy sports  --  an NBA team in Las Vegas could be a good bet . ( the WNBA 's Connecticut Sun already plays at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville , Conn . ) <p> For Las Vegas to get the All-Star Game , Stern secured a firm agreement that the local casinos would agree not to take wagers on the game . In becoming the first professional sports league to host its all-star event in a city built on gambling , the NBA has raised speculation that the city is next in line for an NBA franchise . " I do n't think there is any question that the 2007 All-Star Game is a prelude to that possibility coming about , " said ESPN NBA analyst Greg Anthony , a Las Vegas native who played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in determining the viability of it . " <p> Las Vegas is the nation 's fastest-growing metropolitan area , with the population tripling in the past 20 years to about 2 million . A professional team could also draw upon thousands of entertainment-seeking visitors to the city . Las Vegas drew more than 37 million visitors in 2004 . <p> The NBA had a brief history in Las Vegas . During the 1983-84 season , former Utah Jazz owner Sam Battistone scheduled 11 games at UNLV 's Thomas &; Mack Center . The experiment lasted just one season , but it will forever be remembered as the place where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar overtook Wilt Chamberlain as the league 's all-time leading scorer . <p> In recent years , the NBA has n't exactly taken a bite , but it is moving closer to plucking the apple . Las Vegas is the first non-NBA city to host the league 's All-Star Game , and it already has a summer league that drew 16 teams , including the Washington Wizards , last season . The Sacramento Kings play the Los Angeles Lakers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . And , the U.S. men 's national team , which will compete in the world championships in Japan next summer and the Beijing Olympics in 2008 , will hold its training camp in the city beginning this summer . <p> When asked if the NBA was warming to the possibility of eventually having a team in Las Vegas , Stern said : " I would n't say warming . I would say we 're recognizing Las Vegas 's attractiveness as a destination , while at the same time recognizing there is this one little issue  --  called sports betting . " <p> When the Jazz played in Las Vegas 22 years ago , the NBA had a no-gambling agreement with the casinos to prevent betting on those games . And Stern required the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario to abolish any wagering on NBA games before the 1995-96 season . In British Columbia that meant removing NBA contests from the provincial government-controlled Sports Action betting games , in which players who correctly predicted the point spreads of at least three NBA games won cash prizes . In 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on NBA games . <p> Goodman , a 66-year-old Philadelphia native who admits that he would bet on anything  --  including the direction a cockroach would turn  --  said the prevalent perceptions of gambling and sports are archaic . He considers Las Vegas the " safest " place to play games ; that it would be wrong to look at the city and " think of anything untoward or unseemly , about accepting bets on games . We 're the only state in the union , the only place in the world , that regulates the games . " <p> The Nevada Gaming Control Board regulates sports bookmaking , which is legal , and the casinos were instrumental in uncovering a point-shaving scheme at Arizona State in 1994 . Goodman added that worries about any potential connections between organized crime and professional sports are also unfounded . " I know because I 'm criminal defense lawyer and I used to defend all the guys who used to fix the games . They 're all gone , " said Goodman , whose most notorious clients were Frank " Lefty " Rosenthal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed by Joe Pesci in the 1995 film " Casino . " <p> Joe Maloof , who co-owns the Sacramento Kings and the Palms Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas , was instrumental in getting the All-Star Game to the city . He said Vegas has moved beyond its Sin City image . " It 's changed , " he said . " I think it 's a matter of time before a major league franchise comes to Vegas . " <p> Stern views sports betting as the only obstacle keeping a professional team out of Las Vegas and would n't rule out seeing a team moving to the city in the near future . " I think it 'll happen . I 'm not going to say which sport will go first , but I think it will happen , " Stern said . " It 's certainly true that any owner who has to move in a hurry probably considers Vegas an option . " <p> Maloof , however , said the city wo n't be able to attract an NBA franchise until it " steps up and hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas &; Mack Center , which has a capacity of 18,776 and will host next year 's All-Star Game , does n't have the luxury suites to support a professional franchise for the long haul , Maloof said . When told of Maloof 's comments , Goodman laughed . " I love Joe Maloof . And I 'd love him to build an arena . I 'd give him a piece of land to build it on , " he said . <p> Oklahoma City was able to lure the New Orleans Hornets partly because it already had an NBA-ready facility in Ford Center , which was built in 2002 with the intent of attracting a professional basketball or hockey team . Kansas City , Mo. , is planning to open Sprint Center in 2007 with the same objective , but Goodman said that would n't happen in Las Vegas . " I 'm not going to build it . It may hurt the city 's chances . On the other side , I remember Tampa Bay had an empty stadium for five years . This town grows too fast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Seattle and Sacramento  --  teams that are fighting for new arenas  --  are rumored to be considering Las Vegas as a possible destination for a potential move . The Hornets , who will play in Oklahoma City this season and next season , also considered Las Vegas , among other cities , when Hurricane Katrina forced them to seek refuge last September . Goodman said at least six teams have contacted him about possibly moving to his city , but he did n't want to name the teams because he did n't consider the overtures to be serious . " Right now , I think they look at us as bait , " Goodman said . " They like to talk about us and throw us out there and hope there are some nibbles , then they do n't come . I 'm not interested in that . I 'm not going to go out and chase anyone . They know where I 'm at . " <p> Goodman said there are other reasons why owners would be attracted to his city . " They see me walking around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , " he said with a laugh . <p> The 2008 NBA All-Star Game is scheduled to take place in New Orleans but Rossi Ralenkotter , president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority , said the league has had preliminary discussions about Las Vegas becoming a permanent home for the All-Star Game , in the same way the NFL holds its Pro Bowl in Honolulu . " If the opportunity presented itself , Las Vegas would definitely want to be considered , " Ralenkotter said . <p> Goodman has his sights set higher . The city already has boxing , professional wrestling , NASCAR , the Arena Football League 's Gladiators and the Los Angeles Dodgers ' Class AAA baseball affiliate , the 51s . <p> Goodman sees a void as it relates to professional sports . " It 's a natural that we 'd get a professional team , " said Goodman , who has publicly lobbied for MLB 's Florida Marlins . " Every place I go people are asking me , ' When are you getting a team ? I know they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse of Las Vegas  --  but we have to get the casinos behind it for a team to be successful here . They 're our IBM . They 're our Microsoft . They 're our big corporations . They 're the ones that have to buy boxes and suites , licenses . I 'm not going to waste their time or my time until we get a serious offer from a team that wants to come here . " <p> For a professional sports team to move to Las Vegas , it will be on Goodman 's terms . " I really believe professional sports needs Las Vegas more than we need them , " he said .
