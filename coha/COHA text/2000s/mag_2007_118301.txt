Imagine the sales pitch that might have been delivered in the long hallways of a Ministry of U.S. Sports Culture not very long ago : O.K. , how about this for a television event . The commissioner of the NFL stands at a podium in the middle of a stage . Every few minutes he reads out , in a businesslike monotone , the name of a collegian who has been selected to play for an NFL team . " With the first pick ... " and so forth . No music , no special effects . Just the commissioner and the microphone . Trust me . It 'll kill . // The index cards have scarcely changed . " All these years , and we 're still using the cards , " says Joel Bussert , the NFL 's vice president of player personnel and the impresario of the draft . In 1976 , at the first of Bussert 's 31 drafts , the league provided a stack of index cards on which teams could write their picks . The cards were stamped with blank lines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , of course , the cards are a little bigger and they have team logos stamped on the back , " says Bussert . " But they 're pretty much the same . " ? Little else about the draft is unchanged . // Riding the ever-rising tide of the NFL 's popularity , the draft has become a spectacle unto itself , picking up steam before the confetti has been swept from the Super Bowl turf , then building to a crescendo on the last weekend in April in New York City . " It 's become the second-biggest day of the year for the league , " says Ernie Accorsi , who retired in January after three decades as a personnel executive with the Colts , Browns and Giants . " It 's bigger than the conference championship games , it 's bigger than opening day . It 's bigger than anything the league does with the exception of the Super Bowl . " // This year fans have congregated by the millions on the Internet , tirelessly debating mock drafts and arguing whether the Raiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback ) or Georgia Tech 's Calvin Johnson ( the consensus best player ) with the No. 1 pick . In the meantime prospects spend weeks tuning up for the scouting combine , on-campus pro days and individual workouts . On Saturday and Sunday , ESPN will provide 18 hours of live draft coverage , pulling in ratings that dwarf regular-season college basketball . Fans in game jerseys and face paint will swarm into Radio City Music Hall to cheer or chide each pick . In short , an entire culture has grown in support of an event that resembles sweeps month on C-SPAN. // Why ? Because the draft taps into every fan 's inner fantasy player , giving him a sense of control and power that 's lacking on fall Sundays . No sane recliner jockey believes he can do Peyton Manning 's job -- but plenty of them think they can do Bill Polian 's . " And do it three times as well , " says Polian , the Colts ' president . " It 's noise , folderol and curbside psychoanalysis . " // The deregulation of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses . Where previously fans were limited to two or three college games per weekend , suddenly dozens were being televised nationally , showcasing thousands of potential pros . " College players had been mysterious , " says the ubiquitous Mel Kiper Jr. , who began publishing a draft guide in 1979 and has built himself into a brand name synonymous with the event . " The only guys people had heard of were from Notre Dame or the Heisman Trophy winners . Now there are hundreds of college players ready-made for the draft . " // Looking for a deeper explanation for the draft 's appeal ? Sports sociologist Jay Coakley , professor emeritus at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs , says some fans enjoy seeing athletes in a setting in which they 're " objectified and reduced to pieces of meat ... in the same manner that some women and men watch beauty pageants . It offers a chance to be a voyeur while feeling temporarily superior to those being watched and objectified. " // If that 's too scary , there 's a simpler hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism , before high picks turn into busts , before hope descends into a 2 -- 6 record and strident cries for the coach 's head . " Every team and all their fans think they 're a winner on the day of the draft , " says former Redskins and Texans G.M. Charlie Casserly . " It 's one weekend when nobody loses any games . Everybody is undefeated . " // PREP SCHOOL // At a Sinewy 6 ' 4 " , 219 pounds , USC wideout Dwayne Jarrett is an imposing physical specimen . In three seasons as a starter he caught 216 passes and scored 41 touchdowns . But several NFL clubs are uncertain whether he 's fast enough to merit an early pick , so at USC 's pro day in late March , Jarrett was dressed to run the 40-yard dash in a black sprinter 's unitard with gold insets on the shoulders , similar to models designed by Nike for Michael Johnson in his Olympian prime . Not coincidentally , Jarrett endorses Nike . " When you look good , you feel good , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few draft-related events have changed more dramatically in recent years than pro day . Once a quaint , low-key spring tradition , it grew into a phenomenon in the mid-1980s , when Miami became one of the first schools to use pro day as a recruiting tool , inviting players from the fertile Florida high school system to watch Hurricanes stars prepare to become millionaires . Last year USC raised the bar much higher , bringing in more than 200 high school juniors and allowing more than a thousand spectators in to watch Reggie Bush , Matt Leinart and LenDale White work out for the scouts . " It was awesome , " says USC coach Pete Carroll . " There was a ton of excitement in the air . We had juniors and their families and friends ; we had fans . Just awesome . " // So big had pro day become that the NCAA finally intervened . Earlier this year it banned recruits from attending pro days on official or unofficial visits . The move limits fan attendance as well , since schools do n't want prospects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more awesome . // Still , as Jarrett crouched into a sprinter 's stance to run his critical 40 , USC 's track and field stadium was buzzing . Dozens of scouts were lined up at the finish , and a three-deep semicircle of family , media and underclassmen looked on -- still a circus , albeit with fewer rings . And for Jarrett the moment was the culmination of three months of preparation that began as soon as his college career ended . // Jarrett was one of 29 players to spend most of January and February at Athlete 's Performance in Tempe , Ariz. , an intense training center where agents pay $10,000 ( plus lodging ) to provide their clients with a crash course in combine drills , NFL-style workouts and something that can only be described as a professional lifestyle . It 's a serious place where nobody drinks Kool-Aid ( an in-house chef prepares meals under a nutritionist 's supervision ) , but everybody drinks the Kool-Aid . " We try to paint a much broader picture than just getting ready for the combine , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AP in 1999 . " We try to provide a professional culture that will stick with them through their career . We use that word a lot around here -- culture. " // To further ready their prime clients for the draft , agents such as Tom Condon and Ken Kremer of Creative Artists Agency have added another layer of training by hiring former NFL assistant coaches as tutors . This spring Jarrett was tutored by Lionel Taylor , a former pro wideout and longtime NFL assistant who coached Lynn Swann and John Stallworth with the Steelers . ( " They both had two left feet until I got ' em , " says Taylor jokingly . ) Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn worked with Terry Shea , who was between jobs as quarterbacks coach with the Chiefs and the Dolphins , and defensive linemen Alan Branch of Michigan and Tim Crowder of Texas were trained by Tom Pratt , 71 , who spent 34 years coaching defensive linemen in the NFL. // It 's a fair deal for both sides : The players get professional coaching . The coaches ? " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Pratt , " and pass something along to younger guys . " Not to mention that fact that CAA pays for meals , lodging and all the golf the coaches can play . // Back at USC , Jarrett ran 4.62 in his 40 . Not exceptionally fast , but not painfully slow , either . " People were saying I might run 4.7 or 4.8 , " he said . " This is a relief . " // IF YOU SHOW IT , THEY WILL WATCH // ESPN senior coordinating producer Jay Rothman takes a seat in the network 's cafeteria in Bristol , Conn. , sets a binder emblazoned with the NFL logo on the table and balances a Treo on top of that . Rothman , 44 , produces Monday Night Football and runs ESPN 's coverage of the draft , overseeing 150 staffers on the two-day telecast , the network 's 28th draft . " It 's a bear to prepare for and a ball to produce , " says Rothman . " And let me put it this way : We 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards every few minutes , and we have a hard time squeezing in commercials . " // Considering the nature of the programming , the draft 's ratings are stunning . Last year the eight-hour first day averaged a 4.7 rating ( representing 5.2 million households ) ; more remarkably , the first three hours -- from noon to three on Saturday -- averaged a 5.8 . Those three hours represented the highest-rated sports programming of the weekend , higher than NBA playoff games ( a best of 4.3 ) , NASCAR ( 4.4 ) , golf ( 2.6 ) and track and field ( 1.2 ) . // By further comparison , the average audience for an ESPN prime-time men 's college basketball game is 1.0 and a Saturday-afternoon college football game on ESPN averages a 2.0 . Monday Night Football averaged a 9.9 in 2006 , which means that the first hours of the draft draw more than half the audience of prime-time NFL games . And none of those numbers include the NFL Network 's live draft coverage , which was not rated by Nielsen ( it will be this year ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Internet. // " The whole thing is beyond unbelievable , " says Rothman . " But it is the ultimate in reality television . " // Fair enough . Viewers are aware that in the age of unfettered free agency , the salary cap and mammoth rookie contracts , the draft has never been more important . " With the money in the game right now , " says Polian , " you simply can not make a mistake at the top of the draft , or there 's a very good chance it will set the franchise back years and cost you your career . " // This larger drama is underscored by dozens of smaller ones each year : Eagles fans booing the choice of Donovan McNabb over Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams in 1999 , Aaron Rodgers 's stunning greenroom free fall in ' 05 ( " Our ratings spiked until the Packers finally took him , " says Rothman . " Bad for him , good for us " ) and even last year 's dramatic decision by nine teams to pass on Leinart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESPN first came to the league and proposed putting the draft on television , " says Accorsi . " Pete Rozelle , as much a visionary as he was , said , ' Why ? ' Now we know . " // INFORMATION OVERLOAD // Draft gurus are nothing new . In the winter of 1969 Frank Cooney , then a 22-year-old football writer for the San Francisco Examiner , developed an in-depth rating system for NFL players . Before the draft that spring he likewise evaluated collegians . " NFL teams started getting a hold of me , " says Cooney , " and I was freelancing for any publication that would allow it . There was a following right away . " // Cooney found himself part of a small network of draft zealots , including Carl and Pete Marasco , who published their draft musings in Pro Football Weekly ( where they were succeeded by the tireless Joel Buchsbaum ) , and Palmer Hughes , a schoolteacher who began publishing his own hand-typed draft chart in 1975 . They lived in a shadow world of heights , weights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a Rutgers-Hawaii game in New Jersey , " says Hughes , with more than a little pride . // Cooney , now 60 , operates a wide-ranging sports publishing company that includes nfldraftscout.com , which he says gets " a couple million hits a week . " Hughes , 72 and living in Sarasota , Fla. , still publishes three draft books each year . " Interest seems to be increasing , " he says daringly. // So are the opportunities . Four years ago Mike Mayock , a onetime NFL journeyman , auditioned for an analyst 's job with the NFL Network . Instead Mayock , then 44 , found himself breaking down coaches ' tape . He now does it for a living as a draft analyst for the network . // More than anyone else , however , the man responsible for taking draft obsession mainstream is Kiper . As a Baltimore high school student in the 1970s he 'd skip out of classes to call a sports hotline for draft updates and sometimes would show Accorsi the reports he 'd written about college players . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Md . ) Community College with an old school satellite dish and a massive phone bill from calling college sports information directors , Kiper hand-typed a weighty draft guide and sent a copy free to every NFL team . By 1984 he was part of ESPN 's draft broadcast . " People stop me in airports to ask who their teams are going to pick , " says Kiper , standing on an elaborate ESPN set after eight hours of draft-related taping . " A boy in my daughter 's sixth-grade class did a mock draft . And he did a great job , too . " // POWER TO THE PEOPLE // It 's wing night at Sutter 's Mill on Route 59 in Suffern , N.Y. , near the New Jersey border in Rockland County . Twenty cents buys you a crispy chicken wing for dipping into scalding crimson hot sauce and thick blue cheese dressing -- Tuesday-night dinner for a group of devoted twentysomething Giants fans , who wash it down with tall draft beers and draft talk . Costantino ( Dean ) Pollaro , Tim and Mike Tedino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days each summer and go to games at Giants Stadium . And for the last five years at least two of them have been to the NFL draft . They are the face of NFL nation -- informed , passionate fans who live the league , identifying other fans by their team affiliations , and drafts by the player the Giants picked first . // " My first year going was 2002 , " says Tim Tedino , 22 , a student at Ramapo College . " Jeremy Shockey. " // " I went in 2003 , " says his brother Mike , 20 , who attends Fairfield University . " William Joseph . " // To watch the draft , fans stand in a long , zig-zagging line in Manhattan to get the free tickets that are distributed first-come , first-served beginning at 6 a.m. ; in the past the line usually began forming at midnight , but this year fans wo n't be allowed to queue up until 5 a.m . Two years ago --  " Corey Webster , " says Mirkovich -- Pollaro and the Tedino brothers scrambled back to New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts , the draft is unlike any other fan experience in American sports . Winners and losers are not immediately apparent , and there is no alcohol in the building . " You can actually have an intelligent conversation with fans from other teams , " says Pollaro , 23 . Nearly every fan who enters the building carries with him a mock draft of his own to measure against the real thing . // One year the Tedino brothers brought their father , Jerry , a lifelong fan who 'd gone to all three Giants Super Bowls . He told his boys that , after the Super Bowls , the draft was the best football experience of his life . // As the 2007 draft approached , the Sutter 's Mill gang scoured websites , read newspapers and magazines , and tirelessly watched television . The Giants pick 20th in the first round on Saturday , and it 's important to be prepared and offer the team some guidance . Voices shout from across the wings and beers : // " Paul Posluszny , Penn State ! " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Florida ! " // " Lorenzo Booker , Florida State ! " // The four laugh and chide each other as the energy builds . The joy is in the guessing and in the waiting . Noon on draft day is like an opening kickoff . " What a great moment , " says Mike Tedino . " The commissioner walks up there and stands still ... ' With the first pick of the 2007 National Football League draft , the Oakland Raiders select .... ' "
