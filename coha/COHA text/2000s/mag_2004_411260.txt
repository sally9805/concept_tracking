. See also cover story of same issue A deer track tells a story . It can begin where a buck crosses a logging road in the Big Maine Woods , or where one rises from his bed in the Rockies  --  anywhere Novembers are white , anywhere deer have wild country to roam and hunters have the freedom to follow . It is a tale that unfolds mile after mile , building suspense in a way that few other hunting methods can match , and it does n't end until you leave the track in defeat or raise your rifle in a moment of glory . For all the opportunities that tracking offers , true aficionados are rare . A core of plaid-jacketed disciples in the northeastern states have drawn attention to the method with pachyderm-size bucks , but most rank and file hunters continue to think of whitetails as being too alert to track close enough for a shot . Consequently , popular hunting tactics are predicated on the notion that it 's much wiser to let the deer come to you , rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow a track wherever it leads and for as long as it takes , then you 're already halfway to shooting the animal standing at the end of it . I CHECK THE CONDITIONS Unless you possess a canine nose or a lifetime of experience , you need snow to have a chance at this game . Half a foot of overnight snowfall that stops with the dawn is about perfect , guaranteeing that any tracks you cross will be fresh and the snow underfoot will be silent . Gently falling snow is better yet , because precipitation drives scent to the ground , eliminating one sense from the deer 's arsenal of defenses . If conditions are poor , do n't become discouraged . A rutting buck will be able to hear you crunching over old snow but may be more concerned with sex than danger . You may get a shot when a deer becomes curious about what is following and investigates . Or you may have your chance when a buck and a doe that are traveling together separate when you disturb them , and the buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernier , who conducts a school for tracking , observes that walking whitetails generally stop on odd-numbered steps  --  three , five , seven , and so on an irregular cadence he tries to duplicate when tracking over crunchy snow , hoping to trick deer into thinking that the intruder has four legs instead of two . II CUT A TRACK Along the northern tiers of Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine , as well as in parts of the upper Midwest and the foothills of the Rockies where I hunt whitetails , the most efficient way to find fresh tracks is to cruise logging roads . Because relatively few deer inhabit these remote environs ( in many places , deer density is four to six animals per square mile ) and road assistance is even scarcer , a four-wheel-drive with a good spare and a front-end winch , plus a chain saw for cutting downed trees from your route , can be as crucial to the success of a hunting trip as your rifle . You may easily cover many miles before finding a big track that 's fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ridgelines , or game trails , seeking evidence of bucks that are looking for does or on the way from their feeding grounds to bedding areas . III READ THE SIGN Telling the difference between the track of an average buck and a doe can be difficult , but the track of a really big buck  --  one that you can stick your fist into  --  is about as much like the dainty imprint of a doe as a bobcat 's is like one made by a Siamese . Big bucks walk flat-footed and are more likely to show the indentations of their dewclaws . They also give the impression of a widely spaced , staggered stride , with outward pointing toes , whereas does leave a narrow trail of perfect hearts that point to where they 're going . Then , too , the farther you follow the hoofprints , the more likely you are to see where a buck 's rack has knocked the snow from brush or where he dribbled a little urine as he walked , something that a doe , which squats to pee neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrapes are dead giveaways , as is a bed that shows dark stains under the body from the buck 's tarsal glands . Far more difficult than assigning gender is assessing how long ago the sign was made . There 's no substitute for experience ; you 're going to follow a lot of long-gone bucks before you begin to understand how wind , temperature , and changes in the crystal structure of snow combine to alter a track 's appearance over time . Bernier says that the best way to learn is by tracking your dog . Take him out in the snow , then repeat the process at two-hour intervals and note how the appearance , texture , and color of his fresh tracks differ from the older ones . Do this under varying snow conditions throughout the winter . Then , when hunting season rolls around , note how your own tracks change by comparing your boot prints from dawn side by side with your boot prints made at noon or in the evening . IV STAY ON THE TRAIL Okay , you 've found the track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to follow . Do n't dawdle  --  check your compass and go . The most common mistake trackers make is following too slowly . During the rut , bucks travel widely in search of does that have come into estrus . If you mosey along , stalking each piece of cover with a step and pause , you 're never going to catch up . As a rule of thumb , match your pace to the deer 's . A walking deer leaves tracks about 18 inches apart ; a trotting buck , 3 to 4 feet . The second error hunters make is tracking with their heads to the ground . You are n't going to see any deer down there . Glance at the tracks briefly , noting their course for 5 or 10 feet ( farther in open country ) , then pick up the slack by walking with your rifle at the ready and your eyes sweeping back and forth . Do n't tread directly on the track in case you lose it and need to go back  --  and you will lose the track , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your buck will get mixed up with a lot of other deer . Other times he may backtrack and then jump off to the side , a defensive maneuver to confuse carnivores that hunt by scent . When you lose a track , make a swing to one side and circle out in front . No luck ? Make a bigger swing . Bucks often walk with the wind at their backs . You can try to keep the wind in your favor by leaving the track and circling ahead , but unless the country is relatively open or you know where that buck is likely to bed down , you 're just wasting time . Stay on the trail . You 'd be surprised at how many big bucks are tracked down and shot with the wind at the hunter 's back . Next to aging tracks , the most difficult aspect of this discipline is knowing when the deer is close at hand , dictating that you slow the pace . Often deer will begin to meander and browse a little before bedding down , leaving signs that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start heading into obvious bedding cover , slow down and look hard . Above all , never give up . I once jumped a buck three times in as many hours before finally getting a clear shot . If I 'd turned around the first time I made a mistake , I never would have given him the opportunity to make one later . V MAKE THE SHOT  --  QUICKLY In deer tracking you do n't count antler tines . You do n't try to maneuver for a better shot . If you do , you do n't shoot the buck . The vast majority of whitetails will be aware of your presence before you are aware of theirs . They may pause for three or four seconds to look at you , or they may be out of the gate and running before you shoulder your rifle . Offhand shots are the rule , and you take follow-up shots as offered . Bernier prefers a pump-action rifle with a peep sight , a combination touted by many trackers as superior for rapid , accurate shooting . A low-power scope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for older eyes . Whatever gun you carry , practice with it until it becomes an unconscious extension of your arm . Larry Benoit , the famous Vermont deer tracker , has often said , " The hardest part is finding a big buck . The easiest part is getting them out . " True enough , but words of encouragement wo n't help much when you start at one end of a drag rope that 's looped around the antlers of a 200-pound-plus animal . Just keep in mind that all the miles you 've traveled to get yourself into this predicament were worth it . You 've joined the brotherhood of those few who can call themselves deer trackers and acquired a trophy that stands as testament to your woodsmanship , physical endurance , and courage  --  the very attributes of the great game animal that lies at your feet . DO YOU KNOW YOUR TRACKS ?  --  FRESH : Check the edges of a track left in powdery snow with your finger . Fresh tracks give to the touch . Disturbed particles of snow will give a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into consideration how the weather has changed .  --  2 HOURS OLD : In powdery snow the edges and midline ridge will set and become firm to the touch within an hour or two . A great way to tell if a print is fresh is to briefly place your bare hand down alongside it and compare the two , because your skin transmits heat to the snow at about the same rate as the deer 's hoof.  --  TOO OLD : A track not worth following will look distorted and can fill with snow or debris . Under the right snow conditions , an old track can appear fresh in the shade . Check the trail in an open , sunlit spot , where the tracks will show distortion from melting .  --  HOW BIG ? A fully mature buck ( 3 1/2 years old or older ) will leave a track measuring 5 to 6 inches from toe tip to the back of the dewclaw ( hoof length from 3 to 3 1/4 inches ) . Adult does and immature bucks seldom leave a track more than 4 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you can lay a .30/06 cartridge crosswise inside the hoofprint or dewclaw spread , the deer that left it is fit for the wall .  --  WHICH DEER ? When you pick up the thread of a deer 's path where it leaves the confusion of other tracks , you may find that you 're following another deer . No two bucks walk exactly the same , and usually one toe will be longer or shaped differently than the other , or a chip in the hoof will make the track distinctive . Learn to recognize the characteristics of the buck you 're after so you wo n't waste time .  --  IS HE CLOSE ? According to tracking expert Dick Bernier , a reliable indicator that a deer is nearby is a J-hook in the trail . " That means the buck is about to lie down . Generally , I 'll drop right to my knees and start looking under tree limbs . If there 's any incline , that buck will probably bed on the uphill side . You have to be ready . "  --  BUCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck track from a doe track . One clue you can consider is the trail 's pattern : The rear hooves of all deer tend to overlap the front hooves . But due to differences in pelvic structure , the rear tracks of a buck often land slightly inside the front hoofprints and sometimes fall a little short of them . A doe places her hind hooves on top of the front track and slightly outside of them . The toes of a heavy buck may splay out a little to each side , giving the impression of a widely spaced , staggered stride , whereas a doe 's neat tracks point to where she is heading . A heavy buck is also more likely to leave the impression of his dewclaws.  --  OTHER SIGN : Do n't confine your observations only to tracks . Cold will quickly freeze lances of urine and pellets . If yellow snow gives to the touch and the pellets are soft with a shiny look , there 's a good chance the deer is n't too far down the trail . Bucks leave larger droppings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas a doe hunches back and urinates in a slight spray pattern straight between her rear hooves .

There on the wooden floor  --  where the couch had been  --  were thirty-two tight ones . An invasion of little cylindrical money robots that lived under the sofa . I 'm sure , Father Gomez , you are asking , " Yes , but what is a tight one ? And why were thirty-two of them under the couch ? " I will tell you . A tight one is a short can  --  usually a Planters nut tin  --  with a roll of cash squeezed " tightly " into it . Some would have you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one because it sort of resembles . . . well , an asshole . It is what they call a play on words . This may sound unusual , to find a tight one under a couch , much less thirty-two tight ones . Not so . Old people believe a sofa is somehow more secure than Citibank . They do this because they do not trust banks , because many of them remember the Great Depression , a time before ATMs and credit cards , a time when cold hard green cash was king , and so it is that these old people hoard cash . A nut can is a little taller than the bills are wide , but low enough to fit under most of the cheap-ass couches you 're liable to find in one of these places . This is not to say they do n't hide money other places . I have found old people 's money built into drapery valances . I have found cash in hollow Bibles . I have found cash in mattresses , taped under dressers , built into the underside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine cabinet . You have to be clever to find a geezer 's money , and you have to have a feeling , or sense , that the money is there in the house . Like people who find water in the ground with sticks , certain people have a talent for finding cash . I am one of them . It is in the blood of my ancestors . Within the industry of estate liquidation , I am called a " feeler . " It is not because I have a feeling about money being in a house . The name suggests that we feel up the furniture looking for hidden money . It does not surprise me you have not heard of feelers , unless maybe a parent died with a house full of crap that needed to go away . Nothing of obvious value , usually , just a kitchen full of dented saucepans , scratched glassware , soiled mattresses , a sagging sofa , and perhaps a curio cabinet choked with Lillian Vernon trinkets . It all goes to the dump , and it is feelers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul it away . In the Brooklyn yellow pages , you would not find me under feelers but under home content removal , if I was actually listed . Dedicated feelers do n't advertise . Work comes to us mostly by referrals from estate lawyers , funeral homes , movers , real estate agents , what have you . I hire the day workers , arrange for the Dumpster , salvage and sell what I can , and make it go fast . When called for a job , I take a look at the house , walk through and try to imagine where the money is , or if there are any antiques that could bring some money . The clients , relatives of the deceased , have removed anything they think is valuable from the house  --  that they know of , anyway . Sometimes I am not sole sourced , and the client is taking bids from different feelers . In those cases , I have to have a very keen sense about what loot the house might contain to make a good bid on the work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . If it looks likely that there may be some return on the furniture , and I get the feeling the place might have hidden treasure , I might even barter our labor , clean the place for free . No matter what , I have the client sign the complete release of all contents to me . All signed and legal . I explain to the client that this is to ensure that they have removed everything they want and that I am free to dump the whole lot . What this means to me is that any valuables I find , I get , even thirty-two tight ones . At this particular house on Vanderhoosen Drive , I wasted no time in directing my day laborers to the greasy floral- print , sagging , stinking , crumb-laden couch and motioning them to lift it . What did I hope to find ? One or two , maybe four or five , tight ones . Perhaps none at all . But thirty-two ? There was n't room for many more under there . I about shit myself . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Including a feeler they call Pete the Prick . After I won the job and he did n't , he shouted to me across the bar at Oscar 's Grille : " Good luck finding any tight ones in that shack , asshole spic motherfucker ! " You see how Pete got his unfortunate name ? From his unfortunate disposition . How much was there in those cans ? I could not know . If it were all Georges , Lincs , and Hams ( ones , fives , and tens ) , nothing to write home about . Jacks ? Now we 're talking . If the cans were loaded with Grants or Bens . . . there could be a million or more squeezed into those peanut tins . Routine procedure , no matter how many tins there are , is to make them vanish . You do n't want the client to stumble in and see all that cash because they may balk and try to back out of the contract , call lawyers , the police . It gets ugly . Also , as a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who see you carrying large sums of mazuma , especially anybody from the government . You did n't imagine that this was declared income , did you ? So I grabbed a black construction bag from the pile of supplies , opened it , and motioned for the laborers to throw the cans inside . My foreman , Speedy , directed them in Spanish . Even though I am part Spanish and grew up in a Hispanic neighborhood , I speak Spanish poorly . So Gonzales speaks for me , in a variety of different South and Central American dialects . He also listens to what the workers are saying to make sure there 's no stealing on their part . I thumbed a wad of bills in one of the cans  --  twenties and fifties  --  and handed it to Speedy , for him to distribute to the workers at the end of the day , and to take his cut of whatever is inside . I share the wealth a little when I find loot . Good karma , they say , and worth every penny . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers will keep their mouths shut , at least for a little while . I took the bag down the cracked brick steps along the overgrown lawn to my car . It was an old beater , a white Camaro with rusty patches and MARTINEZ HOUSE CLEANING printed on the doors in black stick-on letters that were almost completely straight . It was parked behind the truck-sized Dumpster . With the bag in the passenger seat , I drove carefully home to my apartment . You do n't want to get pulled over with a lot of cash . The cops can smell money . Whether they want some , or just to break your balls , you know they 're going to ask questions . Yes , the money was legally mine . But I would just as soon not have the police involved in anything I do . Most people are this way , I think . I mentioned the Brooklyn yellow pages before because Brooklyn is where I lived and had always lived . Nobody has any control over where they grow up , and East Brooklyn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east by Rockaway Bay , the west by a slanting parkway , the north by a canal , and the south by a shopping center . There is a boulevard and an avenue that cross , and each is commercial . The avenue is shopping centers and one-story brick businesses like car washes , diners , auto repair , and convenience stores . The boulevard is more village-like with two-to four-story brick buildings in a variety of styles and colors . The first floors are commercial , and the upper floors are residential , so it is where people who live in East Brooklyn go to shop for daily life . Side streets are tree-lined , with runs of unremarkable brick two-and three-story buildings set just far enough apart to park an unremarkable car . Midblock , there are often alleys , which are very old and historical with names of the original settlers . Yes , our neighborhood goes way back , but the past has been paved over and all that is left are the street names . These alleys cut through blocks at slants for two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes slant because it is how cows and pigs used to move with the contour of the land . I can not tell you if this is true . Contours of the land are now roads and buildings . In fact , I drove through an alley on my way home and parked on the street near the front of my four- story redbrick building . Bag over my shoulder , I keyed my way into the foyer and almost did n't check my mail . You would think with a bag bulging with tight ones over my shoulder , I would let the mail wait , but I had been expecting an important envelope . And there it was ! Crammed into the little box was a big white envelope from Genealogy Consultants LLC . This was turning into quite a day . I climbed the steps to my apartment in what seemed only a few strides . I live on the fourth floor of a postwar redbrick twelve-unit building on the avenue . My apartment is nothing special . Just a place to lay my bones at night after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so plain , I once walked into my neighbor 's place while he was taking a shower and watched the first period of a basketball game before I realized the remote had the mute button in the wrong place . I just do n't care about where I live  --  now . I have my dreams , though , my destiny . I 've been saving the tight ones . Just not under the sofa . Two hours after arriving home I was looking at eight hundred thousand and forty dollars in mostly Grants in stacks of ten thousand  --  ten rows by eight  --  on my living room floor . ( I put the extra forty in my pocket  --  everybody likes a round number . ) They had been curled so long that I needed eighty weights to hold them flat . I do n't keep that many weights around my place ; nobody expects to ? nd that many tight ones . So I used anything I could put my hands on . My collection of Spanish history books , shoes , boots , a flashlight  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done . Hands on my hips , I surveyed the money with the amazed wonder of a conquistador before an Incan treasure . I glanced at the white envelope from Genealogy Consultants LLC on the table next to the front door . I had n't opened it , but I did n't need to now . What lay before me was proof positive . The blood of Spanish explorers burned in my chest . Could the name CortTs or Pizarro be in the white envelope ? I am not an idiot . I know , I hunt money in old houses , and do not conquer foreign lands for treasure , but the compulsion to look , to look every day , it must be the same as dropping anchor at an uncharted land . Where had this wondrous pile of greenbacks come from ? Is it possible old Mr. Trux had hoarded so much ? Had he stolen it ? Of course , there was no way to tell where it all came from originally , so I stopped asking myself this ridiculous question . The important thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it away . I knew I could n't keep it on my floor , but I needed to flatten out the bills , you know ? Got to store it flat . So I went to the closet and found a suitcase , an old thing I never use because I never go anywhere . It was cloth and plastic and had a blue-and-green plaid design on the side like it was Scottish , probably because it was cheap like a Scotsman . I had not used it since my honeymoon . Marta was long gone , and good riddance , so being rid of this reminder of her was a good thing , too . One by one I pushed the stacks of bills in , and though they kept curling , the weight of the money itself started to hold the rest down . When I finally zipped it closed , the suitcase was bulging like a pregnant bagpiper , and it was heavy , perhaps twenty or thirty pounds . So I ask you  --  where would you put a large sum of cash like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was n't much time , either . How long before word trickled through the day laborers and got around ? The closet ? What if the house burns down ? What if my place is robbed ? The car ? What if I have an accident ? What if some junkie pries open the trunk ? I do n't have an office ; I work out of my car . I do n't have a basement , or an attic . A safe deposit box is n't big enough . I snapped my fingers : self-storage . There 's a place off the boulevard . I looked out my front window to make sure there was nothing suspicious on the street , and then looked out my peephole . I opened the door a crack . I looked both ways . Hey , you ca n't be too careful . I would n't put it past Pete to send some guys around to take it away . With the Genealogy Consultants LLC envelope under my arm , I left and locked the apartment , the floor still covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four flights of stairs , looking over the banister , listening . When I made it to the ground floor , I was almost to the building foyer . " Where you going ? " The voice  --  like that of a chain-smoking three-hundred-pound toad  --  was behind me . I recognized it and felt the hair on my arms stand up . It was the voice no person wants to hear when you have a lot of cash , or usually any other time . It is the voice of one of Brooklyn 's most reviled inhabitants , one without a soul , conscience , or scruples . Nobody likes them ; most fear them . Turning slowly , I heard the sandals flip-flop toward me . I be held those black , untrusting eyes , the scowl , the brown gnashing teeth of . . . my landlord . " Going on a trip , Morty ? " It was like he knew something , like he suspected , like he could smell the cash , the greedy man-beast . I tried not to show fear , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he . I am taller than he , six foot , and he was too fat to go to his toes , so I was looking down on him when I smiled my big white teeth , like the smile I make for the girls . I gestured to the bag with a wave of my hand and said , " Ah . Because I have a suitcase , you think I am traveling ? " This landlord , he only squints and says nothing , as though what I had said was stupid . I continued . " Shirts . I am taking shirts to the cleaner . " " In a suitcase ? " he snarled . " But of course , and why not , yes ? This way they do n't get as wrinkled . " " But they 're going to press the shirts anyway , yes ? " " If they are less wrinkled , my cleaner charges me less . " <br> Now the landlord monster toad is looking more curious . " What cleaner you take them to ? " " What cleaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say yes , he will check . Why does he care ? Why would he do this ? Because he is a landlord , and they live to snoop . " Nnnno . I take them to . . . New Jersey . " Even he would n't go all the way to New Jersey to check on a cleaner to see if I was charged less for shirts that were wrinkled less . His eyes went wide . " Well , that would explain it . " For many Brooklynites , New Jersey is the object of suspicion and general disdain , like it was one large insane asylum . It does n't help that the state is host to towns with names like Weehawken and Hoboken and Piscataway  --  could they be towns where elves live ? Anyway , as a rule of thumb , anybody who lived outside of Brooklyn , much less New York City , was clearly out of their mind and capable of anything , even charging to clean shirts by how many wrinkles they have . " You go all the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " My girlfriend  --  she lives there . " " What the hell is wrong with you , Morty ? We got girls here in Brooklyn you can fuck . Lotta spic girls , too . You do n't need to go to . . . " he could n't even bring himself to say the state 's name , just jerked a thumb westward . I began moving to the front door , having thwarted my landlord like the conniving troll that he was . He was now thinking about the girl and not the suitcase . " They say you can not pick your woman . She picks you . " " TED ! " This was the voice  --  not a voice , because like a banshee , she never spoke  --  the choleric shriek of the landlord 's wife . It came from the gloom beyond his open apartment door . She was even more horrible than he , and he feared her like we fear landlords . She was so large she could not even leave their grotto . The woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he turned to retreat to his cave , as if to say , " You got that right , buster . " OlT ! I was out the door with my money , and an hour later the eight hundred thousand in the Scottish suitcase was safely sealed in a storage locker . As you can imagine , I was flying . I 'd scored the money free and clear . I could write my own ticket . I could accelerate my plans for the future , to reclaim my birthright . But like Pizarro with the wealth of Peru at his feet , I would be lucky to escape with my skin . He did not . <br> Continues ...
