A Play in free Act <p> commissioned by McCarter Theatre , <p> Princeton , New Jersey <p> PLAYWRIGHT , middle-aged <p> BLOND ACTRESS , childlike but about thirty <p> Lights up . The Playwright is typing on an old portable typewriter on a stool or a small raised table . His actions need not seem realistic . He faces the audience , brooding . <p> The Blond Actress appears at the rear , glimpsed through a scrim . She may also be veiled or wear something diaphanous over her face . Her clothing is white , and she is barefoot . <p> Blond Actress talks and laughs to herself . We need not hear her words clearly . <p> ACTRESS : . . . promised . " Always love you : ' " Never write about you : ' He said ! Oh , I knew ... But I did n't ... did I ? ( Laughs . ) <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Has been typing rapidly with two fingers but now ceases . ) She 's always in the way ... Oh God . <p> Blond Actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the Playwright to the other side of the stage . A light , shrill ripple of laughter . <p> Playwright shivers . Has he heard ? He removes the sheet of paper from the typewriter , hesitates , and crumples it . ( As the Blond Actress mimes closing a window . ) Playwright becomes warm , uncomfortable . <p> Playwright suddenly becomes excited , angry . He inserts another sheet of paper and quickly types a line or two . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Voice raised . ) You did lie ! Oh yes . When there was n't yet any need . <p> Blond Actress moves behind the Playwright . Fluffs the back of his hair and eases away , giggling , as he turns and fails to see her . <p> ACTRESS : That again ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( An old argument . ) There was never any need . You debased us both , making me out to be ... jealous . ( Pause . ) Who shut that window ? ( Pause , in a louder voice . ) What about him ? Actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLAYWRIGHT : You know who I mean . <p> ACTRESS : ( Reluctantly , but its an earnest , breathless manner : ) It was that . . : magic in him . . . he could reach right irs . . . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Meanly . ) Busy fingers , eh ? <p> ACTRESS : His eyes ... <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Myopic , like mine . ( A beat . ) But he exploited you . As a woman . <p> ACTRESS : A woman ? What do I care about myself as a woman ... ? I came to New York to act . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Bullshit . You always gave him too much credit . The moth to the flame . I hate it , in interviews , you inflate his worth . <p> ACTRESS : Oh , but how could I . . . ? He was like . . you . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Ignoring this ; typing a few angry lines . ) Yes . What women do . Deflect attention from themselves , to inflate some self important bastard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . Is that what . . . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Darling , you knew how to act when you came here . You could have taught us all . <p> Actress shakes her head uncertainly <p> PLAYWRIGHT . I hate that , too , the way you deliberately ... misipterpret yourself <p> ACTRESS : I do ? Gee ... <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Sabotage yourself . <p> ACTRESS : " Sabotage " ... ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : You were a goddamned good actress when you came to New York . He did n't create you . <p> ACTRESS : ( Sudden laughter . ) You created me . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Nobody created you . You were always yourself <p> ACTRESS : But ... who 's that ? ( Pause ; twines hair around fingers . ) Well , I guess I knew ... some things . When I made movies . I was reading Stanislaski ... slavki . And the diary of ... Nijinski . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Gently corrects pronunciation . ) Nijinski . <p> ACTRESS : ( Suddenly upset . ) Do n't you laugh at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ACTRESS : I see words on the page , I do n't know how to say them . But I know what they are . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Right . You always did . <p> ACTRESS : It 's hard , though . . . to know what you know . Until it happens . Like . . . when I had to improvise ? Like striking a match . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : You do n't have to know . You were a natural . <p> ACTRESS : But I want to know ! <p> PLAYWRIGHT : The hell with that , you were a natural actress from the start . <p> ACTRESS : Oh , hey ! Why 're you mad , Daddy ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : I 'm only saying , darling , you were born with the gift . A kind of ... genius . You do n't need theory . Forget Stanislavski . Nijinski . ( With disdain . ) Him . <p> ACTRESS : ( Quickly . ) I never think of him . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Disgusted . ) Him messing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big thumbs smearing ... breaking ... a butterfly 's wings . <p> ACTRESS : Hey , I 'm no butterfly . Feel my muscle ? My leg here . I 'm a dancer . <p> The Playwright turns as if to touch the Actress , who has moved away . The Actress , restless , executes several dance steps . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Bullshit theory is for somebody like him ... ca n't act , ca n't write . <p> ACTRESS : Kiss-kiss , Daddy ? C'm on . <p> The Playwright rises to approach the Actress , who eludes him . <p> ACTRESS : Hey , listen : he was n't my lover , really . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : What 's that mean- " really " ? <p> ACTRESS : Oh , he might 've done some things , but it was n't . . . Do n't look at me like that , Daddy . That scares me . ( She seems genuinely scared . ) <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Cab ) What did he do ? <p> ACTRESS : ( A giggle . ) Nothing actual . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I guess . How d ' : Ciu mean ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : As a man touches a woman . <p> ACTRESS : ( Drawing near , a quick caress . ) Mmmm . Like this ? Playwright ss started . <p> ACTRESS : . . . This ? ( Another caress . ) Maybe this ? <p> Playwright reaches for her hand as if to bring it to his lips but she eases away . <p> ACTRESS : But Daddy ; like I said : it was n't anything actual , y'know ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Agitated . ) " Actual " . . . ? <p> ACTRESS : Just something in his office ? Like ... a present to him ? He asked to interview me . ( Pause , as if such an honor astonished her . ) He was skeptical , he said . Why 'd a famous movie star want to study at his theater ? He thought it was ... some kind of publicity thing ? Like anybody 'd care where I went , what I did ? Now I 'm done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . He was suspicious , I do n't blame him . I guess I cried . ( Pause . ) <p> PLAYWRIGHT : What kind of questions did he ask you ? <p> ACTRESS : My ... motivation . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Which wraps ? <p> ACTRESS ( Almost inaudibly . ) To . . . not die . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : What ? <p> ACTRESS : To not die . To keep on . . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Way then It when hed ted you ? To " comfort " you ? <p> Actress is agitated and dt reply . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Eventually he made love to y ! au , less ? How many times ? <p> ACTRESS : Oh , it was n't 1-love ! I do n't know . . Gee , Daddy , this makes me feel bad . You 're mad at me . <p> PLAYWRIGHT . Darling , I 'm not mad at you . I 'm just trying to understand . <p> ACTRESS : I did n't even know you then ! I was ... divorced . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... office of his . <p> Actress shrugs . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : That greasy . . . stained . . . sofa of his . <p> Actress shrugs . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Why ? ! <p> ACTRESS : I was so flattered ! This New York intellectual ... this brilliant ... Jew ... So many books in his office ! And he 'd read them , you could tell . Some of them ... the titles I could see ... in German ? Russian ? A picture of Mr. Pearlman with Eugene O'Neill . All these great actors . . . ( Excited , recounting . ) I saw this book in German ? I 'd read , in English ? ( Mimes pulling a book off a shelf , opening it . ) Schopen-haur-er . I made this joke , " I can sure read Scho-pen-hauer better when he writes in English , than like this : ' <p> PLAYWRIGHT . ( Laughs . ) That 's funny . <p> ACTRESS : ( Pleased . ) Mr. Pearlman laughed , too . ( Pause . ) But he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . ( Pause . ) I mean , I read some parts of that book . A photographer I used to know gave me a copy ... " This is the unsparing truth , The World as Will and Idea . " <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Bullshit ! A woman like you , contaminating your mind with " philosophy . " <p> ACTRESS : I read it till I felt too sad . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( As if conceding a point . ) He was always saying , people asked about you , how surprised he was . Your quality . What you 're really like . <p> ACTRESS : ( Shy . ) Gosh , what 'd that be ? What I 'm really like ? ( Pause . ) <p> Playwright types a few words , staccato as if inspired . <p> ACTRESS : Oh , Daddy , you do n't ever tell people , do you ? Because I 'm your ... wife . <p> Playwright continues typing . <p> ACTRESS : ( Anxious . ) A husband and a wife , that 's a sacred bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced to testify . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Darling , I would never speak of you . It would be like flaying my own skin . <p> ACTRESS : You would never write about me , either ... would you ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Offended . ) Of course not . <p> ACTRESS : This that happened ... with him ... was just ... just ... what happened . How many times I tried to tell you , Daddy . Like a , a present to him , to thank him ? Like ... " The Blond Actress " ? For a few minutes . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : You 're saying you gave the Blond Actress to that pig . Let him make love to her . <p> ACTRESS : He was n't a pig . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : He was a prince ? A saint ? <p> ACTRESS : How 'd a saint make love ? ( Giggles . ) <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Exactly what did he do ? <p> ACTRESS : Oh , my just kissing me . Different places . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : With your clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : His clothes ? <p> ACTRESS : Daddy , I do n't know ! I did n't look . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : And did you have a . . . sexual response ? <p> ACTRESS : Probably not . I do n't , mostly . . . Except with somebody I love . Like you . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Keep me out of this ! This is about you and that pig . <p> ACTRESS : He was n't a pig ! Just a man . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : A man among men . Actress moves away , restless ; a touch of mania in her dance movements . She edges partly behind the scrim as if about to exit . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Loudly . ) A man among the Blond Actress 's men . Actress returns , gliding in a dance routine . <p> ACTRESS : Now I remember ! I 'd think of how it was n't me anyway . But Magda in your play . ( She 's thrilled . ) The gift you were giving me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> PLAYWRIGHT : He cast you without consulting me . He did all the casting when he directed . <p> ACTRESS : He did n't tell you about me , I know ! I was so scared ... I revered you so . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : He told me , " Trust me . I 've got your Magda . ' <p> ACTRESS : Did you trust him ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Has to admit this . ) Yes . <p> ACTRESS : Why I do n't remember better , my m-mind gets stuck on a role I 'm doing , and I . . . it 's like I 'm in two places at once ? With other people but not . . . with them . Why I love to act . Even when I 'm alone I 'm not . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Your gift is so natural , you do n't " act . ' You require no technique . Yes , it 's like a match being struck . A sudden flaring flame ... <p> ACTRESS : ( Mild protest . ) But I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to ... think . It 's like talking with somebody . In Hollywood , on the set , I 'd have to hide my book if I was reading ... ( Laughs . ) People thought I was strange . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Your mind can get muddled . You 're easily influenced . <p> ACTRESS : Only by people I trust . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : I trusted Pearlman . <p> ACTRESS : He never hurt you . He 'd boast about you . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : When we were investigated by HUAC , Pearlman hired an expensive Harvard lawyer . Wasp . Me , I hired a guy right here in Manhattan , a friend . " Commie-lawyer ; ' he was called . I was the idealist . Pearlman was the pragmatist . ( Pause . ) Damned lucky I did n't get sent to prison . <p> ACTRESS : Oh , Daddy ! That wo n't ever happen again . It 's 1956 now . We 're more advanced . <p> PLAYWRIGHT . He had a sexual response , yes ? <p> ACTRESS : Ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playwright 's next lines , Actress exits swiftly . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : You and him . . . you never told the full truth , did you ? <p> Actress has gone . Playwright glances around baffled . <p> Has the scene ended ? Playwright is stunned . Goes to the window to open it , but it 's stuck . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Tugging at collar . ) So warm ... ( Hand to forehead . ) Fever ? ( Laughs . ) Then 1 ca n't be dead . <p> The Actress returns with several fresh-cut flowers and a vase with water in it . The flowers have large heads , like hydrangea . <p> ACTRESS : ( A manic gaiety . ) It 's our anniversary , the day we met . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Beautiful flowers . . . But you 've cut the stems too short . <p> ACTRESS : ( A little sharp cry . ) Oh , again ! <p> The Actress puts the flowers in the vase , but they look odd , with such short stems . She pushes the vase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Playwright catches it . <p> ACTRESS : Why do I always do that ! It looked . . . right . <p> The Playwright takes a shallow bowl , pours water from the vase into it , and floats the flower heads in it . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : You do n't have to tell me , darling , if it 's too painful . <p> ACTRESS : Tell ... what ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : How many times . . . you and him . <p> ACTRESS : Daddy , I do n't know . My mind 's not ... an adding machine . ( Pause , pointing at flowers . ) That 's okay to do that , like that ... ? Nobody 'd laugh at you ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Quiet vanity . ) Not at me . <p> ACTRESS : Not at you . <p> Actress is moving about restlessly . Lifts a leg , grips the ankle in an exercise routine . <p> ACTRESS : Funny , then , you 'd have a wife . People 'd laugh at . PLAYWRIGHT : Why do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hands beneath breasts , shakes herself . ) " Jell-O on springs . " <p> PLAYWRIGHT : You invited laughter , you demeaned yourself . <p> ACTRESS : It 's okay . If they ca n't have you , there 's different ways of revenge . Men , I mean . ( Pause , dances . ) That movie I made where I danced , Jane Russell and me ? We had to rehearse so much , all our toes bled . ( Pause . ) I loved Jane . We went to the same school , Van Nuys High , didja know that ? We did n't know each other ... Jane was so popular , and pretty . ( Pause . ) I 'd get laughed at then . Guys would whistle and bang on their lockers . <p> PLAYWRIGHT . Remember , you said you would n't . <p> ACTRESS : " Dwell upon the past . " Okay . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : We 're alive now . <p> Pause . Actress giggles . <p> ACTRESS : We are ? ( Dances teasingly away . ) <p> PLAYWRIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like yours . <p> ACTRESS : just I started too late . You have to start young . Starve yourself ... ( Pause . ) Why I was so grateful to Mr. Pearlman , giving me a new chance . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Angry . ) The hell with that . I told you : you exaggerate his role in your life . <p> ACTRESS : ( Matter-of-fact . ) He accepted me as a student . Age twenty-nine . Offered me your play ... you would n't have done . ( Pause ; Playwright ca n't deny this . ) Oh , gosh , if he 'd turned me away ... that day ... <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Quickly . ) Do n't . <p> ACTRESS : ( Strange thrill ) I 'd think . . . if somebody sort of brushed up against me . . . on the subway platform . . . it would n't be my fault , if I fell ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : That did n't happen . <p> ACTRESS : ( Caressing body , laughs . ) BLOND ACTRESS FLAT <p> TENED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why you berate . With him . You need to show : Thgttude . Thats how you 're " grood . " <p> ACTRESS : That 's what it is ? I guess . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : But this , was farre . . . you and I met . <p> ACTRESS : Oh , Daddy ! Yes . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : And it was , how many times Five , six ? Fifty ? <p> ACTRESS : What ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : You know what . <p> ACTRESS : Just four or five times . ( Pause pig : ) I 'd go into Magda , I was n't there . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : He was married . <p> ACTRESS : I guess . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : But hell ; I was marred , too . Yes ? <p> Actress draws back guiltily . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Did you ever . . . come ? <p> ACTRESS : Huh ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ... have an orgasm ? With him ? <p> ACTRESS : You promised you would n't ! Like this . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die . Those times . <p> Playwright types furiously for a few seconds . <p> ACTRESS : Why did n't you let me , you bastard ! <p> Playwright types . <p> ACTRESS : You wanted it , too . For me to die . . . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Reverting to his subject , as if he had n't heard . ) Just tell me : did you ever have an orgasm with Pearlman . <p> ACTRESS : Did I ... oh , gee , Daddy , I did n't know you then , did I ? I mean , as a real person ... ( Pause . ) I knew your work . I revered you ... <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Him " kissing " you . That mouth . ( Disgust . ) <p> ACTRESS : ( Agitated . ) Oh , gosh , if this was a , a ... script ... I 'd know where it was going , and I w-would n't be scared ... <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Just improvise . Tell the truth for once . <p> ACTRESS : Oh , Daddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't say the word. ) ... it was only just for that scene , you know ? And then the scene was over . <p> Playright yanks out skeet of paper , crumple ir . <p> ACTRESS : Now entire mad at met Do n't you 1-love e ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Slowly . ) I . . . love you . <p> ACTRESS : You do n't ! Not me . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Yes . You . <p> ACTRESS : The Blond Actress , maybe : " You loved her : : . sod : <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( More certain . ) Of course I love you , darling . I 'd like to save you from yourself , is all . Wanting to hurt yourself . Actress smiles and shakes her head vigorously , denying this . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : The low value you persist in placing on yourself . <p> ACTRESS : ( Excited . ) Oh , but , already I am ... saved . By you . My new life with you . ( Pause . ) My husband . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , strong hands ... <p> A beat . Playwright eases his hands away from Actress . She stares at him searchingly , but he seems not to see her . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( To himself ) It wo n't work . It 's folly ... It will . I can be strong enough for both . <p> A cue to Actress that the scene is ending . She backs away , dancerlike , twining a strand of hair around her fingers . <p> ACTRESS : ( Wistful , unaccusing . ) Daddy , you wo n't write about me , will you ? Us talking like this . After I 'm ... ( Pause , awkward . ) When , maybe , you do n't love me anymore ? <p> PLAYWRIGHT : Darling , do n't say such things . I 'll always love you . <p> Actress retreats behind the scrim . Playwright ca n't follow . <p> PLAYWRIGHT : ( Anxiously . ) You know , darling ... do n't you ? <p> Actress has vanished . <p> The Playwright tries again to open the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep in concentration . With two fingers he types rapidly , a staccato burst of sound that ceases almost immediately . <p> Light fades on the Playwright and the bowl of flowers , which has been placed on the floor near his feet . Lights out . <p>
