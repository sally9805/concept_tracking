On Feb. 13 , the day before she gave the first of two damning testimonials to Congress , Enron vice president Sherron Watkins spent the afternoon in a cluttered conference room in the Rayburn House building on Capitol Hill . It was a cram session of sorts , a final chance for Watkins , her attorney and congressional staff members to review the dozens of subpoenaed documents she would be quizzed on the next morning . As they ate cold pizza , someone drew her attention to an e-mail titled " Confidential Employee Matter " that had been written by one of Enron 's external lawyers . " Per your request , " it began , " the following are some bullet thoughts on how to manage the case with the employee who made the sensitive report . " Her eyes skipped halfway down the page : " Texas law does not currently protect corporate whistle-blowers . The Supreme Court has twice declined to create a cause of action for whistle-blowers who are discharged ... " <P> Her pulse quickened . " I 'm reading this and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days after I met with Ken Lay . Talk about shoot the messenger . I ca n't believe they looked into firing me , " she says , sounding wounded even now in the retelling . " It was a horrible response . There 's nothing in there to remind them to remember the code of conduct , the vision and values . " <P> This was how hard Watkins had fallen for Enron . Here she was , almost six months to the day since she first warned chairman Kenneth Lay of " an elaborate accounting hoax . " Her boss had long ago confiscated her hard drive , and she had been demoted 33 floors from her mahogany executive suite to a " skanky office " with a rickety metal desk and a pile of make-work projects . The atmosphere had grown so ominous that she had called office security for advice on self-defense . But still , Watkins simply could not fathom that this company , the one she had tried to save from itself , had considered taking away the job she loved . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her periwinkle blazer , with her pastor seated directly behind her . For five hours , she patiently explained the intricacies of the financial schemes that had allowed the energy giant to conceal billions of dollars of debt in dubious partnerships . Though Watkins had not worked in accounting for a decade , she knew the arcane material cold , making it sound as simple and intelligible as long division . She was relaxed enough to give the Representatives a taste of her piercing Texas wit . But her square jaw clenched whenever she spoke about her feelings for the company . She firmly indicted several top executives , yet she insisted that Lay was a " man of integrity . " And she spoke almost wistfully of Enron 's " electric " atmosphere , of people " energized to change the world . " It was Valentine 's Day , and she was still very much in love . <P> For months afterward , Watkins faithfully went to work each day . In the absence of any real assignments , she could only bear witness to all that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sign at its headquarters ( price : $44,000 ) and as the firm 's esteemed accountants , Arthur Andersen , went down in their own wave of scandal .
