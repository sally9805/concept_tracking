<p> It 's a temperamental , overcrowded bandwagon this Denver baseball team has built , operated by a hundred thousand separate drivers , burdened with 12 years of dashed hopes , and subject to recall at any moment on the whims of disgruntled fans . <p> A purple horde packed Coors Field on Saturday night as the Rockies hoped to sweep Philadelphia in the National League division series . Leading the series after winning two games in Philly , the Rockies have reignited the baseball flame in Colorado . The park is full . The scalpers are happy . The owners are making big money . <p> Will the fan wagon keep rolling ? Will it even make it out of the garage next spring ? <p> Is this a Labor Day-to-Halloween romance for the Colorado Rockies , and come next April , the fickle public 's attention is back to spring skiing and cheap flights to Mexico ? <p> Tap the bumper of any October Rockies fan , and you 'll jump-start a quick answer . <p> " If they start with a slump next spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jason Gilligan , who in the spirit of the season has temporarily suspended abuse of the Rockies ' owners on his website , monfortsmustsell.com . " The fans are excited , but I do n't know if they trust it yet . " <p> Gilligan 's rage is countered by legions of fans who stuck with the Rockies through the losing seasons and roster overhauls . They 're already looking for more seats for next year , and they 'd like to check the loyalty tickets of the fans just now jumping on the back of the wagon . <p> " Hell , yes , I am inclined to see more games next year , " said Adam Reiner , a former Chicagoan who says that , in the first 23 years of his life , he never felt Cubs or White Sox love as intense as Coors Field was last week . <p> But Reiner refuses to look too far ahead . " This year is not over . I expect to see these guys in the World Series . That 's how sick they really are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recurring theme here . Jon Schmieder , the executive director of the Metro Denver Sports Commission , said he thinks fans in Denver have been aching for a winning team - that the fans who packed Coors Field on opening days gone by drifted away not out of a lack of interest but out of heartache at watching the team continually lose . <p> " The people I 've talked to , they 're passionate about them winning , " Schmieder said . " But they have to see it first before they say , ' OK , I 'm in . " ' <p> Current fans often settle on a guardedly optimistic outlook for the team 's future . Call it Rocky Mountain Realism . Cheer out of one side of the mouth , and out of the other , warn the owners , Charlie and Dick Monfort , to do the right thing : Use playoff money to keep the young team together another five years . <p> Sheldon Rediske gave up his season tickets a few years ago and now goes to games only when out-of-town friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games next season , but " it depends what they do in the offseason . " By that , he means : Will the Rockies spend the money it takes to keep their now-proven talent ? <p> There is hope on that front . Buoyed by increased ticket sales , Rockies owner Dick Monfort said Tuesday that the team plans to boost its relatively small $54 million payroll next season . <p> The cost of maintaining team <p> Fence-sitters like Rediske will wait to see how high the team is willing to go . He thinks " if you own a sports team , that 's more of a hobby . You need to spend the money , and up to this point , they have n't . " <p> Schmieder said the spending criticism can cut both ways . It 's great , he said , that the Monforts plan to spend more money . <p> " But if we do n't go and buy tickets , they ca n't get much money to spend , " he said . " So hopefully our support will make them say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay Matt Holliday . " ' <p> It is clear there is a delicate tipping point - where enough fans support the team that raising payroll to get more wins is a safe investment and where the team wins enough that fans know it is safe to give their hearts - and money - to the Rockies . <p> But lingering support is never automatic for sports teams . Bandwagons guzzle gas and go empty fast . <p> The Rockies hold the all-time annual attendance mark for baseball , from the expansion year in 1993 , at nearly 4.5 million . They also hold four of the top 11 records . Yet attendance plummeted this decade , when fan favorites were traded and management changed strategy seemingly every spring . <p> Got tickets ? You 've got pals <p> In other cities without strong baseball traditions , support waned after one-off postseason runs . The upstart Florida Marlins won the World Series in 1997 , but saw attendance drop by nearly 8,000 a game the very next season , when the owners dumped payroll . The Arizona Diamondbacks won the Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 39,500 the next season . A year later , ticket sales were back down to 34,600 . <p> Let those silly people come and go , is the philosophy of the Rockies ' core fans , who are n't about to give up their seats on a wagon that , for them , has been rolling down the road for 166 games now . <p> " I have always been and always will be a true Rockies fan , as opposed to the fair-weather fans that are suddenly coming out of the woodwork , " said Erin Borcher , who sees three or four games each year and has made the pilgrimage to Rockies spring training in Tucson . " Next season will be no different , as I will see as many games as I can get to . " <p> Katie Sanchez and her husband see 20 games a year in person , and she says they 'll be there next year too , " whether they win 40 games or win the World Series . " <p> Count her among the irritated for having to elbow-dodge instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great there will be a full house , but it is sad they ca n't be there to support the team even when they are n't winning 14 out of 15 . " <p> The savviest fans know their plans will change for next season even if they do n't buy tickets for more games . Let 's put it this way : Old Rockies fans have lots of renewed acquaintances . <p> " I 'm not sure it will make us pay any more attention next year , " said Meriel Drummond , who has gone with her father to about 25 Rockies games a year since Denver won a franchise .
