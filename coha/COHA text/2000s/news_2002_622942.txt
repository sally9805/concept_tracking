<p> Major recent cases of scientific fraud have spurred some serious soul-searching among academic administrators and science policy-watchers : <p> Are fraud and other forms of scientific misconduct on the increase ? If so , is the increase related to changes in the nature of scientific practice or funding  --  such as the tightening bonds between science and the competitive world of startup research firms ? <p> A Chronicle survey of the Bay Area 's three most prominent academic institutions  --  UCSF , UC Berkeley and Stanford University  --  found that a total of 38 charges of research misconduct have been filed since 1994  --  an average of about five charges a year . <p> Those allegations have led , in turn , to 17 investigations and eight findings of wrongdoing , ranging from falsification of data to plagiarism of other researchers ' work . That 's an average of one conviction per year for all three campuses combined  --  hardly an epidemic of evildoing . <p> In interviews , campus administrators said that 38 allegations spread over eight years at three prominent universities did n't sound very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science  --  once the pursuit of bright loners who toiled in the lab , clinic or observatory by themselves , or in small groups  --  is becoming so big-budget , high-stakes an enterprise that old scientific ethics are disintegrating . <p> The number of allegations " does n't surprise me , " said Robert Price , associate vice chancellor for research at Berkeley , whose duties include monitoring alleged misconduct . <p> Still , Price wonders whether the sheer size and competitiveness of 21st century research collaborations  --  physics or biotech teams with hundreds of members from scattered institutions , whose work may lead to Nobel Prizes or money-making new drugs  --  may encourage a nefarious few to play fast and loose with data . <p> " The pressures for recognition , for making breakthrough discoveries are huge , " observed Price , a political scientist by training . " You have these ( competing ) teams working on similar terrain , and they 're racing to the goalpost . " <p> Concern about scientific fakery appears to be a quasi-cyclical American phenomenon , one that revives every decade or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last cycle , about a decade ago , led to a circus atmosphere of congressional investigations and media McCarthyism that , many feel , unfairly tarred some scientists . The most famous case was Nobelist David Baltimore , who had defended a colleague accused and later exonerated of faking data in genetic studies . <p> The latest brouhaha emerged this summer , when stunning frauds were uncovered at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Bell Laboratories . <p> The Berkeley case involved Victor Ninov , a Bulgarian-born physicist who was fired after an internal investigation concluded he had faked data supporting the alleged discovery of a " superheavy " element , element 118 . Ninov maintains he is innocent . <p> The lab 's investigation found it " incredible " that " not a single collaborator " on the 15-member scientific team bothered to check Ninov 's false claims . <p> In the Bell Labs case , Jan Hendrik Schon , a German physicist , was fired for faking data in research on superconductivity and electronic phenomena involving organic materials . Some experts say it is one of the most egregious examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " certainly gives us pause " and raises broader questions , said Tom Theis , director of physical sciences at IBM Research at Yorktown Heights , N.Y . <p> " Are we sufficiently scrutinizing the extraordinary claims that our own scientists make ? Do we have the right ( scientific ) culture ? Have we drifted away from the kind of open and , to some extent , confrontational culture that is necessary for science to go forward ? " <p> Others wonder if the recent cases are the result of changes in the way science is funded . <p> " One can see , over the past decades , increasing pressures on researchers in the physical sciences , " said Arthur Bienenstock , a Stanford physicist who chairs an ethics committee for the American Physical Society ( APS ) . <p> " The funding from the federal government in the physical sciences has not kept up with the true cost of research . So competition for funding has gotten greater and greater , ( and ) that might lead some people to commit fraud , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims , if true , would have been of historic importance . By contrast , the eight cases of scientific misconduct at UCSF , Stanford and UC Berkeley between 1994 and 2002 seem like pretty weak tea . <p> None of the 15 Berkeley cases listed between 1994 and 2002 involves what is typically regarded as the most heinous form of scientific misconduct : the deliberate fabrication of data . One person was convicted , in 1995 , of failing to follow correct procedure in research on human subjects ; he was assessed a small monetary fine . <p> Seven other Berkeley cases included charges of some kind of intellectual theft  --  plagiarism and instances in which a researcher " misappropriated " another 's invention or research findings . Two of the 15 Berkeley cases , including one involving plagiarism , are still being adjudicated . <p> Stanford investigators found only one case of true scientific misconduct out of 12 allegations . That case involved " fabrication of data , " according to the university 's formal summary of its investigations since 1994 . <p> UCSF investigators reported the fewest allegations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of 11 allegations from 1994 to date , six resulted in findings of wrongdoing of one kind or another . <p> For example , one UCSF scientist funded by the National Institutes of Health falsified unpublished data on the behavior of biomolecules within women 's reproductive tissues . The scientist " admitted that he had altered data in eight experiments that he performed during December 1993 and January 1994 , " according to a report on the case in the Federal Register . <p> What happens to scientists convicted of fraud ? For such scofflaws , there is no " Science Jail , " no scientific equivalent of Devil 's Island . <p> Consider the latter case at UCSF : As punishment , he signed an agreement " not to apply for federal grant or contract funds and will not serve on PHS ( Public Health Service ) advisory committees , boards or peer review groups for a three-year period . " However , he was allowed to continue his clinical practice , as long as it did n't involve federal research funding . <p> In a case involving falsification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a postdoctoral fellow  --  was punished by having his work " monitored for two years , " said Dorothy F. Bainton , vice chancellor for academic affairs at UCSF . <p> Why so light a punishment ? <p> After all , Ninov and Schon 's purported frauds cost them their jobs . But there 's a key distinction , it appears : Ninov and Schon were big-time players in the world of science , men who made thrilling claims , the undermining of which infuriated and humiliated their colleagues . <p> By contrast , the UCSF postdoc made no sensational claims and was n't even a member of the faculty . Despite his Ph.D. , he appears to have been treated as a quasi-student , someone too young to deserve the career equivalent of execution . <p> " The decision was that he was someone in training , " Bainton explains , " and that he needed additional training . " <p> It 's not that the scientific community is n't taking the issue seriously . <p> A major effort to learn more about the prevalence of scientific misconduct is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Services ' Office of Research Integrity , which plans to send questionnaires to thousands of scientists . <p> And the American Physical Society , which represents 40,000 physicists , recently issued a set of revised ethical guidelines . It calls for more ethics training in science and urges all research institutions to adopt procedures based on federal policies for handling misconduct allegations . <p> American Physical Society president William Brinkman vowed last month that " we shall make a concerted effort over the next few years to better educate physicists in appropriate professional ethics , standards and practices .
