Welcome to the Revolution // A Case Study on Exercise and the Brain // ON A SLIGHT swell of land west of Chicago stands a brick building , Naperville Central High School , which harbors in its basement a low-ceilinged , windowless room crowded with treadmills and stationary bikes . The old cafeteria-its capacity long dwarfed by enrollment numbers-now serves as the school 's " cardio room . " It is 7:10 a.m. , and for the small band of newly minted freshmen lounging half asleep on the exercise equipment , that means it 's time for gym . // A trim young physical education teacher named Neil Duncan lays out the morning 's assignment : " OK , once you 're done with your warm-up , we 're going to head out to the track and run the mile , " he says , presenting a black satchel full of chest straps and digital watches-heart rate monitors of the type used by avid athletes to gauge their physical exertion . " Every time you go around the track , hit the red button . What that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's going to tell you , this is how fast I did my first lap , second lap , third lap . On the fourth and final lap-which will be just as fast if you do it right- " he says , pausing to survey his sleepy charges , " you hit the blue button , OK ? And that 'll stop your watch . Your goal is-well , to try to run your fastest mile . Last but not least , your average heart rate should be above 185. " // Filing past Mr. Duncan , the freshmen lumber upstairs , push through a set of heavy metal doors , and in scattered groups they hit the track under the mottled skies of a crisp October morning . Perfect conditions for a revolution . // This is not good old gym class . This is Zero Hour PE , the latest in a long line of educational experiments conducted by a group of maverick physical education teachers who have turned the nineteen thousand students in Naperville District 203 into the fittest in the nation-and also some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its scheduled time before first period . ) The objective of Zero Hour is to determine whether working out before school gives these kids a boost in reading ability and in the rest of their subjects . // The notion that it might is supported by emerging research showing that physical activity sparks biological changes that encourage brain cells to bind to one another . For the brain to learn , these connections must be made ; they reflect the brain 's fundamental ability to adapt to challenges . The more neuroscientists discover about this process , the clearer it becomes that exercise provides an unparalleled stimulus , creating an environment in which the brain is ready , willing , and able to learn . Aerobic activity has a dramatic effect on adaptation , regulating systems that might be out of balance and optimizing those that are not-it 's an indispensable tool for anyone who wants to reach his or her full potential . // Out at the track , the freckled and bespectacled Mr. Duncan supervises as his students run their laps . // " My watch is n't reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . // " Red button , " shouts Duncan . " Hit the red button ! At the end , hit the blue button . " // Two girls named Michelle and Krissy pass by , shuffling along side by side . // A kid with unlaced skateboarding shoes finishes his laps and turns in his watch . His time reads eight minutes , thirty seconds . // Next comes a husky boy in baggy shorts . // " Bring it on in , Doug , " Duncan says . " What 'd you get ? " // " Nine minutes . " // " Flat ? " // " Yeah . " // " Nice work . " // When Michelle and Krissy finally saunter over , Duncan asks for their times , but Michelle 's watch is still running . Apparently , she did n't hit the blue button . Krissy did , though , and their times are the same . She holds up her wrist for Duncan . " Ten twelve , " he says , noting the time on his clipboard . What he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really loafing around out there ! " // The fact is , they were n't . When Duncan downloads Michelle 's monitor , he 'll find that her average heart rate during her ten-minute mile was 191 , a serious workout for even a trained athlete . She gets an A for the day . // The kids in Zero Hour , hearty volunteers from a group of freshmen required to take a literacy class to bring their reading comprehension up to par , work out at a higher intensity than Central 's other PE students . They 're required to stay between 80 and 90 percent of their maximum heart rate . " What we 're really doing is trying to get them prepared to learn , through rigorous exercise , " says Duncan . " Basically , we 're getting them to that state of heightened awareness and then sending them off to class . " // How do they feel about being Mr. Duncan 's guinea pigs ? " I guess it 's OK , " says Michelle . " Besides getting up early and being all sweaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , I was cranky all the time last year . " // Beyond improving her mood , it will turn out , Michelle is also doing much better with her reading . And so are her Zero Hour classmates : at the end of the semester , they 'll show a 17 percent improvement in reading and comprehension , compared with a 10.7 percent improvement among the other literacy students who opted to sleep in and take standard phys ed. // The administration is so impressed that it incorporates Zero Hour into the high school curriculum as a first-period literacy class called Learning Readiness PE . And the experiment continues . The literacy students are split into two classes : one second period , when they 're still feeling the effects of the exercise , and one eighth period . As expected , the second- period literacy class performs best . The strategy spreads beyond freshmen who need to boost their reading scores , and guidance counselors begin suggesting that all students schedule their hardest subjects immediately after gym , to capitalize on the beneficial effects of exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can all learn . // FIRST-CLASS PERFORMANCE // Zero Hour grew out of Naperville District 203 's unique approach to physical education , which has gained national attention and become the model for a type of gym class that I suspect would be unrecognizable to any adult reading this . No getting nailed in dodgeball , no flunking for not showering , no living in fear of being the last kid picked . // The essence of physical education in Naperville 203 is teaching fitness instead of sports . The underlying philosophy is that if physical education class can be used to instruct kids how to monitor and maintain their own health and fitness , then the lessons they learn will serve them for life . And probably a longer and happier life at that . What 's being taught , really , is a lifestyle . The students are developing healthy habits , skills , and a sense of fun , along with a knowledge of how their bodies work . Naperville 's gym teachers are opening up new vistas for their students by exposing them to such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find something they enjoy . They 're getting kids hooked on moving instead of sitting in front of the television . This could n't be more important , particularly since statistics show that children who exercise regularly are likely to do the same as adults . // But it 's the impact of the fitness-based approach on the kids while they 're still in school that initially grabbed my attention . The New PE curriculum has been in place for seventeen years now , and its effects have shown up in some unexpected places-namely , the classroom . // It 's no coincidence that , academically , the district consistently ranks among the state 's top ten , even though the amount of money it spends on each pupil-considered by educators to be a clear predictor of success-is notably lower than other top-tier Illinois public schools . Naperville 203 includes fourteen elementary schools , five junior highs , and two high schools . For the sake of comparison , let 's look at Naperville Central High School , where Zero Hour began . Its per- pupil operating expense in 2005 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New Trier kids scored on average two points higher on their ACT college entrance exams ( 26.8 ) , but they fared worse than Central 's kids on a composite of mandatory state tests , which are taken by every student , not just those applying to college . And Central 's composite ACT score for the graduating class of 2005 was 24.8 , well above the state average of 20.1. // Those exams are n't nearly as telling as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS ) , a test designed to compare students ' knowledge levels from different countries in two key subject areas . This is the exam cited by New York Times editorialist Thomas Friedman , author of The World Is Flat , when he laments that students in places like Singapore are " eating our lunch . " The education gap between the United States and Asia is widening , Friedman points out . Whereas in some Asian countries nearly half of the students score in the top tier , only 7 percent of U.S. students hit that mark . // TIMSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 edition included 230,000 students from thirty-eight countries , 59,000 of whom were from the United States . While New Trier and eighteen other schools along Chicago 's wealthy North Shore formed a consortium to take the TIMSS ( thereby masking individual schools ' performance ) , Naperville 203 signed up on its own to get an international benchmark of its students ' performance . Some 97 percent of its eighth graders took the test-not merely the best and the brightest . How did they stack up ? On the science section of the TIMSS , Naperville 's students finished first , just ahead of Singapore , and then the North Shore consortium . Number one in the world . On the math section , Naperville scored sixth , behind only Singapore , Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , and Japan . // As a whole , U.S. students ranked eighteenth in science and nineteenth in math , with districts from Jersey City and Miami scoring dead last in science and math , respectively . " We have huge discrepancies among our school districts in the United States , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a good thing that we 've at least got some Napervilles-it shows that it can be done . " // I wo n't go so far as to say that Naperville 's kids are brilliant specifically because they participate in an unusual physical education program . There are many factors that inform academic achievement . To be sure , Naperville 203 is a demographically advantaged school district : 83 percent white , with only 2.6 percent in the low income range , compared with 40 percent in that range for Illinois as a whole . Its two high schools boast a 97 percent graduation rate . And the town 's major employers are science-centric companies such as Argonne , Fermilab , and Lucent Technologies , which suggests that the parents of many Naperville kids are highly educated . The deck-in terms of both environment and genetics-is stacked in Naperville 's favor . // On the other hand , when we look at Naperville , two factors really stand out : its unusual brand of physical education and its test scores . The correlation is simply too intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see for myself what was happening there . I 've long been aware of the TIMSS test and how it points to the failings of public education in this country . Yet the Naperville 203 kids aced the test . Why ? It 's not as if Naperville is the only wealthy suburb in the country with intelligent , educated parents . And in poor districts where Naperville- style PE has taken root , such as Titusville , Pennsylvania ( which I 'll discuss later ) , test scores have improved measurably . My conviction , and my attraction to Naperville , is that its focus on fitness plays a pivotal role in its students ' academic achievements . // THE NEW PE // The Naperville revolution started , as such things often do , with equal parts idealism and self-preservation . A visionary junior high physical education teacher named Phil Lawler got the movement off the ground after he came across a newspaper article in 1990 reporting that the health of U.S. children was declining . // " It said the reason they were n't healthy was that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall man in his fifties , with rimless glasses , who dresses in khakis and white sneakers . " These days everybody knows we have an obesity epidemic , " he continues . " But pick up a paper seventeen years ago and that kind of article was unusual . We said , We have these kids every day ; should n't we be able to affect their health ? If this is our business , I thought , we 're going bankrupt . " // He already felt like his profession received no respect ; schools had started cutting phys ed from the curriculum , and now this . A former college baseball pitcher who missed out on the majors , Lawler is a sincere salesman and a natural leader who became a gym teacher to stay close to sports . In addition to teaching PE at District 203 's Madison Junior High , he coached Naperville Central 's baseball team and served as the district coordinator for PE , but even in these respectable posts , sometimes he was embarrassed to admit what he did for a living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity-a chance to make his job matter . // When Lawler and his staff at Madison took a close look at what was happening in gym , they saw a lot of inactivity . It 's the nature of team sports : waiting for a turn at bat , waiting for the center 's snap , waiting for the soccer ball to come your way . Most of the time , most of the players just stood around . So Lawler decided to shift the focus to cardiovascular fitness , and he instituted a radical new feature to the curriculum . Once a week in gym class , the kids would run the mile . Every single week ! His decision met with groans from students , complaints from parents , and notes from doctors . // He was undeterred , yet he quickly recognized that the grading scale discouraged the slowest runners . To offer nonathletes a shot at good marks , the department bought a couple of Schwinn Airdyne bikes and allowed students to earn extra credit . They could come in on their own time and ride five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to get an A could get an A if he worked for it , " Lawler explains . " Somewhere in this process , we got into personal bests . Anytime you got a personal best , no matter what it was , you moved up a letter grade . " And this led to the founding principle of the approach he dubbed the New PE : Students would be assessed on effort rather than skill . You did n't have to be a natural athlete to do well in gym . // But how does one judge the individual effort of forty kids at a time ? Lawler found his answer at a physical education conference he organized every spring . He worked hard to turn the event into an exchange of fresh ideas and technologies , and to encourage attendance he talked the vendors into donating door prizes . Each year at the beginning of the conference , he would push a towel cart through the aisles , collecting bats and balls and other sporting goods . Cast in among the bounty one year was a newfangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of dollars . He could n't help himself ; he stole it for the revolution . " I saw that son of a buck , " he freely admits , " and I said , That 's a door prize for Madison Junior High ! " // During the weekly mile , he tested the device on a sixth-grade girl who was thin but not the least bit athletic . When Lawler downloaded her stats , he could n't believe what he found . " Her average heart rate was 187 ! " he exclaims . As an eleven-year-old , her maximum heart rate would have been roughly 209 , meaning she was plugging away pretty close to full tilt . " When she crossed the finish line , she went up to 207 , " Lawler continues . " Ding , ding , ding ! I said , You got ta be kidding me ! Normally , I would have gone to that girl and said , You need to get your ass in gear , little lady ! It was really that moment that caused dramatic changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springboard for everything . I started thinking back to all the kids we must have turned off to exercise because we were n't able to give them credit . I did n't have an athlete in class who knew how to work as hard as that little girl . " // He realized that being fast did n't necessarily have anything to do with being fit . // One of Lawler 's favorite statistics is that less than 3 percent of adults over the age of twenty-four stay in shape through playing team sports , and this underscores the failings of traditional gym class . But he knew he could n't have the students run the mile every day , so he set up a program of what they have termed " small-sided sports " - three- on- three basketball or four-on-four soccer-where the students are constantly moving . " We still play sports , " Lawler says . " We just do them within a fitness model . " Instead of being tested on such trivia as the dimensions of a regulation volleyball court , Naperville 's gym students are graded on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during any given activity . // ( Continues ... ) //
