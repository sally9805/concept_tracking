Chapter One : Prologue " Megan , we need to talk . " Megan Meade swallowed a mouthful of root beer and let the bendy straw fall from her lips . Her heart dropped with it . She squeezed her eyes closed . What were her parents doing back from the base this early ? " This is my first soda of the day , I promise , " she said , spinning in her father 's leather swivel La-Z-Boy chair to face her parents . The moment she saw them , however , she knew they were n't about to talk about her daily sugar intake . This was much more serious . Megan 's parents stood before her in the living room of their cookie-cutter government-issue home , both wearing falsely excited smiles . They were also sporting their dress uniforms  --  her mom in an army green pressed skirt and jacket with dark panty hose , even though it was about a hundred and ten degrees in the Texas shade , and her dad with his collar buttoned so tight his neck was turning red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed her sweating soda glass onto the coaster next to her and braced herself . She 'd been an army brat her entire life , so it was n't hard for her to figure out what was coming next . She just hoped it was n't true . " It 's time to pack your gear , Kicker , " her father announced , forcing a boisterous grin . " We 're moving to South Korea ! " Yup . There it was . Megan went into free fall . Her internal organs turned weightless and started floating around inside her body cavity . She clutched the arms on the chair so tightly her knuckles turned white , just to keep from throwing up . " What ? " Megan blurted . Her voice sounded very far away . " It 's been a while since we were transferred , has n't it ? " her father said matter-of-factly . " This should be exciting . " Exciting ? Had he been testing gas masks over at the base today ? How could anyone think she would be excited about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been born in Rammstein , Germany , at one of the largest American army bases in Europe . When she was five , right about the time she had made her first friend , her family had been transferred to Turkey . After a few years there playing soccer with the boys and learning Turkish from her best friend , Medha , another transfer had come through , sending Megan to the country she had always thought of as home for the first time in her life . All through middle school Megan had moved , from Fort Carson in Colorado to Fort Bragg in North Carolina to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas . She had n't been in any of those places long enough to make any real friends . But here , at Fort Hood , Megan had finally found a home . She had made it through three full grades here . She was on a state-champion soccer team . She had just gotten her learner 's permit . She had a real best friend , Tracy Dale-Franklin . And this year , on the first day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , finally talk to him . She even had the outfit all picked out and had practiced her greeting three hundred and fifty-one times in front of the mirror . This was supposed to be The Year of Megan . Why was this happening ? " Megan ? Are n't you going to say anything ? " her mother asked . Yeah , I 'm gon na say something , Megan thought , standing up . She turned her back to her parents and stared out the window , hugging herself and gripping the sides of her T-shirt in her fists . This was so wrong . Megan had always been the perfect little daughter . She never talked back . She never let her parents know if she was depressed or upset or thought one of their many , many rules was unfair . She had never disobeyed them once in her life . And she was the only girl in school who was n't strutting around the base in a miniskirt and belly shirt like the pop star du jour . Did n't her parents realize how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window at the perfectly cut lawn , the impeccably kept flower beds , she felt like she always did right before she was going to throw up . And it was like an outside force was working on her ; she knew there was no stopping what was about to happen . She turned around and looked directly at her parents . She held her breath . " I 'm not going . " It took every ounce of courage she had just to say those three words , and once they were out , she could n't believe she had said them . No one moved . Megan was having an out-of-body experience . Like last year when she had staggered over to the bench after suffering a concussion in the semifinal game at states . Like she was aware of what was going on around her but it was n't really her that was there . " Come again ? " her father said . " I 'm not going . I 'm not moving to South Korea , " Megan said , still unable to believe the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father exchanged a look . It seemed that they did n't think it was Megan in the room with them either . " I 'm sorry , Megan . We know this is hard for you , " her mother said . " But we 're only going to be there for two years and then you 'll be back stateside for college anyway . " Two years . Two years ? What kind of person put the word only in front of the words two years ? " No . I 'm not going , " Megan said , feeling braver every second her father did n't blow up at her . " You ca n't do this to me . This is my life and ... and I want to live it here ! With my friends ! I mean , what about the soccer team ? And ... and the prom ? And ... " Ben Palmer and his perfect dimples ! her mind wailed . " Megan  --  " " I 'm so sick of this , Mom ! I hate moving . I just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " Megan 's father took a deep breath . His nostrils flared as he let it out . He and Megan 's mother looked at each other again , silently communicating , as they so often did . " Well , there is one other option , " her mother said finally . Megan barely dared to hope . " There is ? " " Your father and I  --  we have to go , " Megan 's mother said , fiddling with her wedding ring . " But if you really want to stay ... " " I can stay with Tracy ? " Megan blurted . " No ... no , " her father said . " The Dale-Franklins already have their hands full . You know that . " Megan knew all too well . Tracy 's older brother , Joe , had graduated and was off at the Naval Academy , much to the chagrin of his " Go Army " dad . His moving out had freed up a bit of room in the Dale-Franklins ' three-bedroom house , but Tracy still shared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her two younger brothers was still bunking in the basement . " Then what ? " " Well , last night Dad was speaking with John McGowan , " her mother said . " John McGowan ? " Megan repeated , dumbstruck . John McGowan was her dad 's old friend from med school . " He said he and Regina would be happy to look after you while your dad and I are in South Korea , " her mother continued , as if she had n't just sent Megan 's head spinning . " We did n't think it would be something you would be interested in . After all , South Korea is such an opportunity for a new cultural experience . However , if ... you feel strongly ... " " John McGowan , " Megan said again . " Yes . John McGowan , " her father said flatly . " Are you all right ? " Were her parents cracked ? Were they certifiably insane ? First they wanted to move her to the Far East , then they suggested shipping her off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all those  --  " The boys will take a little while to adjust , but I 'm sure you 'll all get along , " her mother said . Boys ? Megan 's mind was flooded with images of boys . Boys with missing teeth , their faces smeared with red Popsicle goo , their beady little eyes laughing at her as they lured her behind their house to see their new " puppy " and then lassoed her to a tree and hung her upside down . Greasy-haired , chubby-legged , evil little boys . Boys with worms in their pockets who ate gum off the ground and pulled her hair . " How many of them were there again ? " Megan asked as she lowered herself shakily onto the edge of the couch . Her mother and father pondered this . " Seven at last count , I believe , " her father said . " Quite a brood . " Yes . Quite , Megan thought . Of course , they would n't be grubby-handed little mud-streaked munchkins anymore , would they ? Most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them seven years ago , which meant that now they would be  --  gulp  --  teenage boys . Megan started to sweat . Teenage boys were even worse . Mud-streaked munchkins she could clobber over the head with a wiffleball bat . That was how she had finally gotten pudgy , stringy-haired Evan  --  the worst of the pack  --  to back off the last time after the lassoing incident . But teenage boys  --  those she could not handle . Sixteen years old and she had yet to have a single functional conversation with a boy in her class . How was she supposed to live with seven of them ? " So , that 's the deal , " her father said . " You can either come to Korea with us or stay in the States , but if you stay here , you 're staying with the McGowans . " " Do I have to decide right now ? " Megan asked . " No , sweetie , but soon , " her mother said , leaning over to run her hand over Megan 's strawberry blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She planted a kiss on Megan 's forehead and Megan looked into her eyes  --  exactly the same green as Megan 's own , with just a few wrinkles at the corners . " We 'll miss you so much if you decide to stay . " Megan nodded numbly . " But we just want what 's best for you , so whatever you decide , we 'll support you , " her mother added . Megan swallowed hard . This morning she had woken up with nothing more important to do than practice her Ben Palmer speech and add half a mile to her daily run . Now the whole world had turned upside down . " Thanks , " Megan said finally . Her mother smiled , blinking back tears . " You think about it and let us know . " Megan slumped back into the couch as her parents left the room . All by myself with seven boys or with my parents ... in Korea , Megan thought . Suddenly , running away to join the circus seemed like a workable option . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracy ! Im not even at the airport yet . TooDamn-Funky : cant believe ur leaving me ...
