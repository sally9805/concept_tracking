OL 'S ANNUAL REPORT ON THE NEWEST RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS COMING TO GUN STORES THIS FALL . One of the joys of our yearly gun test is the satisfaction of discovering a new firearm that delivers exceptional performance , possesses uncommon beauty or offers solid value . But that enjoyment is sometimes alloyed with the disappointments of a promising new design or a favorite brand that does n't perform as hoped . Gun testing is a serious business . OUTDOOR LIFE 's gun test takes this business to a more complex level by ranking the year 's new guns against one another . No other magazine in our industry tests firearms this way . Ammo Up ! Question : How much ammo does it take to conduct OL 's firearms test ? Answer : All of it ! Seriously , our testers send hundreds of rounds downrange and gobble up cases of shotshells to ensure that every gun we test is thoroughly evaluated . All of our group sizes on rifles are then averaged to generate a single measure of their accuracy . Rifles UPSCALE RIMFIRES AND NICHE-SPECIFIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For 2007 , we 've added a separate Editor 's Choice award for rimfire firearms . One reason we made this move is the increased variety of rimfire ammo , rifles and handguns , with even more certain to come . Also , it will be more helpful to prospective buyers to test and score rimfires according to their distinctive purposes and performance levels , and certainly fairer than rating them against larger calibers intended for quite different kinds of shooting and hunting . Our test team found it interesting , as will OL readers , that no new junior-size or economy-priced rimfires were submitted this year . This reflects the growing market for better finished , more sophisticated " adult " models . Another trend that 's interesting to watch is the subdividing of what were once general categories . For example , the varmint rifle category is now subdivided into niches such as " walking varmint . " The same holds true for target rifles , which are increasingly built for more specific purposes and smaller niches . RIMFIRE RIFLE WEATHERBY MARK XXII RETAIL : $949 CONTACT : 805-227-2600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have a winner  --  in this case , our Editor 's Choice rimfire , the Weatherby Mark XXII . Anschutz , located in the historic town of Ulm , Germany , is renowned for the accuracy of its Olympic medal  --  winning rimfire rifles . Weatherby , of course , enjoys a unique reputation for the distinctive " California " styling of its firearms and its line of high-velocity magnum cartridges . Working together , the companies combined the trim and accurate German-made Anschutz Model 64 action and barrels with unmistakable , all-American Weatherby styling in the Mark XXII . This year 's judging was unusually close because of the field of exceptionally fine rimfire rifles . Aside from its overall finish and quality look , the Weatherby edged out the competition by dint of five-shot groups running as small as 0.374 inches at 50 yards and 0.810 inches at 100 yards . Its four-round clip proved easy to load ( not always the case with rimfire clips ) , feeding was smooth and easy , and ejection ( another shortcoming of some rimfires ) was positive and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of style and precision : It would be absolutely wicked for ground squirrels , prairie dogs and other varmints at short to moderate ranges . 2007 EDITOR 'S CHOICE FINAL SCORE : F G VG E Workmanship : **** Performance : **** Price/Value : *** TESTERS ' COMMENTS : A very accurate rifle * Fun to shoot * This is an excellent rifle by every measure * Great trigger  --  quality design and workmanship * High price but outstanding performance * Great aesthetics * Best rimfire rifle in the test * Functions great * Classic Weatherby look backed by Anschutz engineering  --  a nice marriage * Good value REMINGTON MODEL 5 RETAIL : $348 CONTACT : 800-243-9700 ; REMINGTON.COM Remington 's Serbian-made rimfire has the look and feel of a centerfire rifle , no doubt the result of gunmaker Zastava 's love of steel  --  and lots of it . The massive receiver is about the same diameter as that of Winchester 's legendary Model 52 target rifle , and the Model 5 's barrel is contoured like a centerfire 's . Even the bottom metal , usually plastic or pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunk of machined and nicely polished blue steel . The overall metal finish , like that of the other Serbian rifles sold under the Remington banner , is nicely polished and deeply blued . The U.S.-made stocks , on the other hand , leave a lot to be desired in terms of fit and contour . The receiver is grooved for standard rimfire-type scope rings and the open sights are much better made than the usual rimfire fare , lending a classy big-bore look . Out-of-the-box accuracy was n't too bad , either . Fifty-yard five-shot groups averaged about three quarters of an inch . I would n't be surprised if the accuracy could be made even better by experimenting with different brands of ammo and tinkering with the bedding .

That 's what the Serbian gun-making firm of Zastava has done with this neat bolt-action , marketed in the U.S. under the Remington banner . From the handle forward , the bolt , extractor and ejector are almost exact copies of the sweet little Sako L-46 actions of a half century ago . The receiver , however , is pure Mauser , including the familiar bolt stop and ejector , in a scaled-down version measuring just a shade over 7 inches overall . Of the Eastern European miniature Mausers I 've inspected in recent years , this is the best . The surfaces are straight and the edges crisp without evidence of overbuffing , an unfortunate hallmark of some gunmakers in former Soviet countries . Accuracy from our .223-caliber sample was only so-so , perhaps a bit better than what you would expect from a slender-barreled lightweight . It would be an excellent walking rifle for coyotes and similar varmints .

This latest Mauser wears the Remington trademark and is made in Serbia by Zastava . The accuracy of our test rifle , while not spectacular , equaled or bettered that of several other more expensive bolt-actions we have tested , and it performed particularly well with Federal 's load with the 150-grain Sierra GameKing bullet , which produced one five-shot group measuring under an inch . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push-button release of the hinged floor plate . Unlike many modern bolt-action designs , the basic Mauser 98 is rather difficult to manufacture , which suits the artisans at Zastava because they seem to like nothing better than to take a chunk of steel and mill , drill , grind , hand fit and polish it into a well-finished firearm . They do it with such economy that their guns are consistently among the best buys in the world 's sporting firearms market . 2007 EDITOR 'S CHOICE FINAL SCORE : F G VG E Workmanship : *** Performance : **** Price/Value : **** TESTERS ' COMMENTS : Nice Mauser action design and appearance * Metal-to-wood fit is a bit rough * Trigger pull has some creep , but the rifle still shot well * Was surprisingly accurate * An excellent choice for Mauser-action fans * Great value * An excellent all-around big-game rifle * Would feel comfortable hunting with it anywhere SAVAGE MARK II CLASSIC RETAIL : $495 CONTACT : 413-568-7001 ; SAVAGEARMS.COM The classiest rimfire rifle in the Savage lineup is the new Mark II bolt rifle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is real American black walnut , and its elegant styling is more than a little reminiscent of the classic American stock makers . Overall , the rifle has a distinct grown-up look , with a hand-filling forearm with a detachable sling stud and black forend tip . The machinecut checkering of our sample was unusually sharp and deep , with the classic point pattern continuing completely around the forearm . The grip area likewise has point pattern panels of checkering and is enhanced with a grip cap . The test team also liked the nicely contoured bolt handle and the all-steel trigger guard . As on other Savage rifles , the AccuTrigger is a real shooting plus . The only notable downside to its appearance is the magazine release , but in fairness the design tended to aid easy removal and insertion of the magazine clip . For a rifle of such quality , we expected somewhat better accuracy in our 50-yard tests .

It conjures the image of a camo-festooned coyote hunter hunkered in the sage with a likewise-camo-clad rifle . From its muzzle to its oversize bolt-handle knob , even to its Weaver-style scope bases , almost everything about this thick-barreled varmint rifle is layered with Mossy Oak Brush camo . The only exception is its AccuTrigger , which lets go at a crisp 12-ounce pull that earned praise from our test team . ( It was noted , however , that the trigger can be tricky to use when wearing gloves , as varmint callers usually do . ) There was minor disagreement among the testers regarding the varmint-weight barrel . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit heavy for a walking rifle ; others thought that the weight-forward balance would steady aim in the sitting or kneeling positions , and that the heavier barrel would aid accuracy . The entire test team had good things to say about the slick action , however , and we agreed that the accuracy was more than sufficient for predator hunting . All this at a very fair price for anyone who 's in the market for a rifle that virtually blends into the background . FINAL SCORE : F G VG E Workmanship : ** Performance : **** Price/Value : **** TESTERS ' COMMENTS : Looks and performs like a precision rifle should * This is a heavy varmint rifle for car and bench only * Very heavy barrel gives it a forward balance * Nice trigger makes for an absolute tack driver CENTERFIRE RIFLE SAVAGE MODEL 12 F/TR RETAIL : $1,142 CONTACT : 413-568-7001 ; SAVAGEARMS.COM In order to understand how the Savage Model 12 F/TR excels , it helps to know a little about the fast-growing target game called F-Class . In F-Class , all shooting is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bipod or a benchrest-type stand , and scopes are allowed . Thus women as well as men , senior citizens as well as young folks , and handicapped as well as able-bodied shooters can compete on an equal basis . Depending on range facilities , firing distances may be a few hundred yards or as much as a thousand yards . An accurate firearm , of course , is a major factor in success , which is why many of the rifles used for F-Class are custom-made affairs . Their several-thousand-dollar price tags could be prohibitive for many competitors . Savage addresses this problem with the F/TR , which has the accuracy to be competitive in F-Class straight out of the box , and at an affordable price . The company applied the tried-and-true building blocks of accuracy : a heavy , stainless-steel 30-inch barrel that has been hand straightened ; a receiver that 's solid at the top and bottom for increased stiffness and held in place by three screws , rather than the usual two ; a laminated hardwood stock contoured for F-Class shooting ; and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull ! 2007 GREAT BUY FINAL SCORE : F G VG E Workmanship : *** Performance : **** Price/Value : **** TESTERS ' COMMENTS : This rifle shot very well * SWAT team application should be excellent * Great trigger , great performance , but a bit short on aesthetics * Lots of features for the price * Congratulations to Savage for a 6-oz. factory trigger * Operates smoothly * Excellent accuracy THOMPSON/CENTER ICON RETAIL : $1,025 CONTACT : 603-332-2394 ; TCARMS.COM Our test gun for Thompson/Center 's Icon , the company 's first bolt-action rifle , was a hand-built , pre-production sample . Thus , we did n't assume the hand-checkered , slickly finished and richly figured walnut stock to be typical of the rifles that will appear in gun dealers ' showrooms . Nonetheless , we liked much of what we saw , especially the metalwork and the rifle 's accuracy . Our test Icon , in standard .308 Win. , proved nicely accurate with the target-grade ammo we used , and the slick bolt and crisp trigger pull earned high praise . The integrally machined Weaver-type scope bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be justified in varmint and tactical versions . The sharp edges of the deeply sculpted butter-knife-type bolt handle were uncomfortable to operate with bare hands , but buyers will be able to replace it with other shapes if they prefer . More serious criticisms are that it was extremely difficult to load the detachable magazine and awkward to load a single round through the ejection port . These are not fatal flaws , however , and can be corrected at the drawing board . This is T/C 's first attempt at a bolt rifle , and the company deserves kudos for a determined effort to produce something truly new , different and possibly even better . FINAL SCORE : F G VG E Workmanship : *** Performance : *** Price/Value : *** TESTERS ' COMMENTS : What a shooter ! * The clip was very hard to load * The sharp edges on the bolt handle hurt , but this can be fixed * Most interesting rifle of the test * Has the makings of a serious big-game rifle Shotguns SUB-GAUGE DOUBLE GUNS CONTINUE TO HOLD THEIR APPEAL FOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 18 new guns we tested , 10 were smoothbores . And of these , four were side-by-side doubles . Having observed gun-buying trends for lo these many years , I 've seen preferences for styles of shotguns ebb and flow like women 's fashions . But the makes and models of side-by-sides available today indicate that this classic style is making a steady comeback . One cause , I 'm convinced , is the desire of baby boomers to return to their roots , real and imagined , and the gentler times represented by hunting with a faithful dog and Grandpa 's double . There is also the delight of shooting a side-by-side and discovering that it is n't necessary to squint down a rib to hit a winging target . That 's wing-shooting at its purest and most elegant . Also , the trend toward smaller gauges continues , with 28-gauge guns from Browning , Marlin ( L.C. Smith ) and Remington adding to a growing selection . The gauge 's popularity has been spurred by the 28-gauge-only events in sporting clays and the discovery that it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with larger gauges , but just as effective and certainly more pleasant . CAESAR GUERINI MAXUM TRAP RETAIL : $6,550 CONTACT : 866-901-1131 ; GUERINIUSA.COM The Guerini single is the first single-purpose shotgun ever to win our Editor 's Choice award , a win even more exceptional because we evaluate such guns by higher standards . The reason ? A typical hunting arm may be used only a few weeks each year and will seldom be fired more than a few dozen times , but a trap gun will very likely be used on a weekly basis , firing hundreds or even thousands of rounds each year . Also , such guns are judged against other high-performance guns , raising the bar even further . The Guerini passed our toughest trials without faltering . From a performance standpoint , it ranks with the most sophisticated of today 's trap guns , with multi-dimensional comb adjustments for precise individual fit and a high-bridge adjustable rib that can be fine-tuned for individual sighting preferences or the vagaries of different trap fields and shooting conditions . What makes the Guerini stand out in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , generous coverage of fine-line checkering and rich receiver ornamentation , enhanced by hand engraving that adds depth and character to its classic pattern . These and other refinements make it a joy to behold . One of the test team members summed up the new Guerini best : " There is nothing about this gun I do n't like . " 2007 EDITOR 'S CHOICE FINAL SCORE : F G VG E Workmanship : **** Performance : **** Price/Value : **** TESTERS ' COMMENTS : This gun really feels good . * Would be my choice if I took up trap shooting again * Needs careful adjusting of comb and rib for best performance * Wow !

BENELLI DUCA DI MONTEFELTRO RETAIL : $1,465 CONTACT : 301-283-6981 ; BENELLIUSA.COM This latest addition to the Benelli lineup is one of those pretty little items you want to snap to your shoulder and say , " I 'd sure like to shoot that little honey . " The entire test team had good things to say about its pretty wood and sharp checkering and even the snazzy ornamentation of its nickel-plated , lightweight receiver . On the skeet field , the little Benelli proved to be as quick-pointing as it looked , and its flawless inertia-driven operation earned quite a bit of praise . We 've had good things to say about Benelli 's inertia-driven system before , and the system works even better with light 20-gauge guns like the Duca di Montefeltro . The slam and shuffle effect of autoloaders is always bothersome , and even more so with lighter , small-gauge shotguns . The quickness and simplicity of Benelli 's inertia system tends to reduce this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot . The Montefeltro also got a great score in the price/value rating , which is why it and a few other well performing shotguns caused this year 's scoring to be unusually high ( and our final decisions especially tough ) .

Whether it 's used for trap or sporting clays , the racy-looking Teknys edges beyond what 's considered state of the art among competition-type autoloaders . At first heft , the Teknys comes across as big and heavy . And with a weight of 8 pounds 11 ounces and a 30-inch barrel , it certainly is . However , a half pound of this weight is due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more-than-worthwhile trade-off during our testing on the trap field . The self-compensating gas system is so quick and smooth that it feels more like shooting a break-action shotgun that does n't kick . The comb is adjustable for height and cast , and the overall buttstock dimensions can be changed by using shims supplied with the gun . Our test sample came fitted with a 50/50 rib  --  meaning it puts half the pattern above and half below the sight line  --  but the package included a rib that puts 70 percent of the pattern above the line of sight ( 60/40 and 80/20 ribs are also available ) . Four forend caps of various weights allow quick gun-balance changes . FINAL SCORE : F G VG E Workmanship : **** Performance : **** Price/Value : **** TESTERS ' COMMENTS : Solid lockup and shot well * Would be my first choice if I shot trap with an autoloader * Wood fit and finish and design are excellent * A lot of gun for the money BROWNING CYNERGY CLASSIC RETAIL : $3,235 CONTACT : 800-333-3288 ; BROWNING.COM An enduring criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather ungraceful . This complaint was partially laid to rest a few years back with the introduction of Browning 's Cynergy , which has a strikingly shallow profile , thanks to its innovative MonoLock Hinge system . Now comes a 28-gauge Cynergy ( it 's also available in .410 ) with a receiver measuring just over 2 inches from top to bottom , making it more svelte than even some small-gauge side-by-sides . The little 28-gauge we tested has a pretty oil-finished walnut stock with traditional checkering . With its 28-inch barrels seeming even longer in slender 28 gauge , the Cynergy Classic Sporting has the look of a thoroughbred racehorse . Our tests on the skeet field revealed a similar prowess at competition , causing one tester to call it " the best Browning ever . " Though it performed well , it lost points on its price/value score . FINAL SCORE : F G VG E Workmanship : *** Performance : **** Price/Value : *** TESTERS ' COMMENTS : Handles and points like a dream * Has many subtle features that make it a great gun , but pricey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEST NEW DESIGN FEATURES FROM THIS YEAR 'S TEST Machined Floor Plate : Usually found only on high-end custom rifles , the machined-steel hinged floor plate on the Remington Models 798 and 799 , with release buttons situated in the trigger-guard bow , was something we especially liked . This convenient and stylish touch allows the hinged floor plate to spring open for quick and convenient unloading of the magazine box . Target Trigger : The red tab extending from the Savage Model 12 's AccuTrigger signals that the trigger pull is a mere 6 ounces . Precise trigger control is a vital element of good marksmanship , and a light pull reduces the likelihood of trigger " jerking " and other such accuracy-spoiling misbehavior . Detachable Bolt Handle : The crisply sculpted bolt handle of T/C 's Icon earned faint praise from our test team because its sharp edges proved more than a little uncomfortable during operation . We did appreciate , however , that the handle can be replaced by another design of the buyer 's choice , thus allowing the use of the stylish butter-knife handle for showcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the field . Adjustable Rib : The easily set adjustment at the muzzle end of Guerini 's bridge-like ventilated rib changes the angle of the sight line with respect to the barrel . This makes it possible for the shooter to control shot-pattern placement relative to his sighting plane . Some trap shooters prefer the straightaway 50/50 alignment , while others prefer a larger percentage of the pattern to hit above the line of sight , providing them with an automatic " lead " for rising targets . MARLIN L.C. SMITH RETAIL : $1,421 CONTACT : 203-239-5621 ; MARLINFIREARMS.COM There 's still magic in the L.C. Smith name , even though the legendary American double we tested in 28-gauge was built in Spain , where side-by-side doubles are as much a part of the national character as bullfights and paella . Though this latest version is a boxlock , the familiar L.C. Smith side plates are there , serving mainly as a background for some light engraving and gold-wash overlay . Beyond that , however , there 's not much a true L.C. Smith aficionado would recognize . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple point pattern would have been more appropriate . The case-hardened coloring is nice , but the monobloc-fitted barrels are unevenly polished ; even the rib itself is uneven . Other criticisms included the chunky , unbalanced look of a 12-gauge frame fitted with small-gauge barrels . On the plus side , operation of the single selective mechanical trigger was reliable , as was ejection of the selective ejectors . The gun is a fair value for someone wanting an entry-level side-by-side upland shotgun , but the test team 's overall opinion is that Marlin could better serve the L.C. Smith name and perhaps even rival its side-by-side competitors by upgrading this gun a bit more . FINAL SCORE : F G VG E Workmanship : ** Performance : *** Price/Value : ** TESTERS ' COMMENTS : Points well * Function was okay * Plain wood lacks aesthetics , but good price * Wood-to-metal fit needs improvement * Good bird gun * Plain to look at , but good gun for new hunter * Fun to shoot BERETTA AL391 URIKA 2 RETAIL : $1,250 CONTACT : 800-237-3882 ; BERETTAUSA.COM " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal reaction of our shotgun test team when Beretta 's 391 Urika 2 was uncased . But as it turns out , the reason they have such great-looking wood on a gun in this price range is neatly spelled out in a small emblem on the laser-checkered grip panel : It reads , " X-Tra Grain , " meaning that the stock 's rich , marble-cake color contrasts are artificially enhanced by artistic and scientific means . Some gunmakers , especially in Italy , have been artificially beautifying stocks for years , but they 've mostly kept their trickery a secret of the trade . Beretta , on the other hand , proudly announces it as its latest contribution to the art . It takes more than pretty wood to earn OUTDOOR LIFE 's coveted Great Buy award , however . What impressed us more were features like the Urika 2 's improved gas system , self-cleaned by a spinning piston to keep it working longer between cleanings ; its magazine cutoff ; the new , easier-to-close bolt release ( someone at Beretta finally listened ) ; the extra recoil pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overbored barrel ; the five color-coded screw-in chokes ; and more . Best of all , we liked the way the Urika 2 handled and performed .

But with so many Italian over/unders crowded into the $2,000 to $3,500 bracket , it 's a challenge to find a lower price while offering the fit and finish we have come to expect in such " Italian Renaissance " shotguns . With the Premier , which we tested in 28-gauge , Remington seems to have deftly balanced value and finish , provided you do n't look too closely . From a performance standpoint , our test team 's only complaints were the heavy trigger pull and the rather short length of pull . Otherwise , the selective trigger and automatic ejectors worked flawlessly . There was also praise for the rolled and laser-engraved receiver ornamentation . Though metal fitting was close and tight locking , the lack of hand finishing in the receiver sculpting was apparent . The darkly finished stocks were hand checkered , an increasingly rare feature .

But even in those circles there is confusion about which Rizzini is which , as there are different manufacturers whose shotguns bear the same name . The side-by-side double submitted for this year 's test is by Battista Rizzini , maker of shotguns and double rifles since 1965 and best known for mid- to higher-grade over/unders . This newest addition to the Rizzini line exhibits the close fit and careful finishing we have come to expect from its over/unders . It 's a product of what I call the Italian Renaissance school of gun making , as Rizzini has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely that it looks like fine handwork , but at significantly lower production costs . Even so , there 's evidence of lots of old-world hand finishing in the fast-handling double we tested , especially around the knuckle , water table , standing breech and classically styled fences . Also notable is the buttery smoothness of the opening lever and double locking bolts . In addition , we liked the BR 550 's stylishly understated receiver ornamentation , crisp trigger pull and ripple-free barrel polishing . Somewhat disappointing , however , was the quality of the wood , which lacked the color and figure of that found on Italian shotguns selling for less . The laser-cut checkering was also not up to our expectations , even considering the lower standard we hold this type of checkering to .

An added bonus is S &W's; unique Heirloom Warranty , which remains in effect for the succeeding generations of the original buyer , which is nice .

Triggers are tested five times with an electronic trigger-pull gauge , and the pull weights are averaged . Multiple Groups : Each shooter fires a series of five-shot groups with every rifle . A precision instrument is used to measure each group , and we determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also list the size of the smallest group . ) Team members test shotguns for a minimum of one round of skeet or trap  --  easily several hundred rounds per gun . Scoring : Every firearm starts with a perfect score of 100 ; points are deducted based on fit and finish , appearance , accuracy , operation and a number of other subjective criteria . Guns are also scored on " price/value , " which is a measure of what you get for the money you pay . How the Charts Work Thermometer Scale : This shows the product 's final score , which is the average of its performance , workmanship and price/value scores . Extra weight is given to the performance category . Star System : The stars in our system represent a range of possible points earned in each category judged : **** ( 90  --  100 ) , *** ( 80  --  89 ) , ** ( 70  --  79 ) , * ( 60  --  69 ) .
