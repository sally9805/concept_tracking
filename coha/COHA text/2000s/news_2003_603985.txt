<p> Referees , umpires and other sports officials from pro leagues to the recreational level increasingly are under siege from coaches , players and a critical populace grown accustomed to a replay culture . <p> A recent string of verbal and even physical attacks from coaches and administrators in pro and college games is exceeded by less publicized attacks in high school and recreation leagues  --  two or three cases of physical abuse each week , according to the National Association of Sports Officials . <p> " It seems whether it 's Little League or Pony League or just high school all the way up to the professional ranks , regardless of the officiating , there is just more abuse and verbal attacks than any year I can remember , " says Dave Parry , the Big Ten 's supervisor of football officials . <p> The NHL suspended Tampa Bay Lightning forward Andre Roy for three games without pay Thursday for shoving linesman Lyle Seitz during a Feb. 11 game . <p> Miami Heat coach Pat Riley was fined $ 20,000 this week for chastising NBA officials  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar screed . <p> Arkansas athletics director Frank Broyles twice shouted last week at a basketball official , " You 're the worst I 've ever seen ! " This came after a win ; he apologized a day later . <p> Some NFL officials complain privately that the scrutiny accompanying replay has made their jobs tougher . Some college basketball officials have an opposite impulse  --  they want more access to replay , not less . <p> And major league baseball umpires fear their sport is inching toward replay with implementation of a camera system in 13 ballparks this season to measure accuracy of ball-and-strike calls . Results will not be made public and the device is merely a self-help tool for umpires , baseball administrators say . Umpires insist it should not be used to rate performance . <p> Tension runs high between baseball 's central office and its umpires , thanks in part to a series of contentious union issues . Now the umps are angry about a machine they do n't trust that might someday trump their power over determining balls and strikes . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of Fame umpire once said of whether a pitch was a ball or a strike , " It ai n't nothin ' till I call it . " <p> Klem umped in more innocent times , long before TV introduced the Age of Replay . Now every play officials call is something  --  and they had better see it the same way a camera does or they 'll face derision and scorn or worse . <p> Officials have always been subject to criticism ; the cry of " kill the ump " is as old as baseball . But the level of criticism has been rising for several years , especially the last few months . <p> * Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan shoved a referee ; Portland Trail Blazers forward Rasheed Wallace menaced another official outside an arena . <p> * No less an eminence than Penn State football coach Joe Paterno chased down an official last fall and grabbed him after a game . <p> * The NHL suspended Phoenix Coyotes forward Darcy Hordichuk for 10 games without pay in November for abuse of an official in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowher chased after officials and confronted them after a playoff loss last month , then berated them in a news conference . <p> This kind of high-profile public behavior trickles down to high school and recreational levels , says Barry Mano , president of the National Association of Sports Officials . <p> " When people see replays that show the best-trained officials in the world make mistakes , and then they see coaches and others rant about it in public , the guy at the local rec league game feels like he has a license to be abusive , " Mano says . " Historically we know that this kind of thing " leads to copycat abuse . <p> When then-Baltimore Orioles second baseman Roberto Alomar spit on umpire John Hirschbeck in 1996 , " we had three spitting incidents within three weeks " at lower levels of baseball , Mano says . <p> That kind of abuse is leading to a shortage of officials in the lower levels of sports . Mano says all but six state associations report a shortage , part of a five-year trend . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officiating . That has n't happened this time . We do surveys and ask officials who leave the business why they do . The No. 1 reason is abuse from spectators . No. 2 is abuse from participants . " <p> Replay a blessing and curse <p> Sometimes , even at the high school and recreational levels , an amateur form of replay figures into the abuse . Parents using camcorders play back close plays in their viewfinders and heckle officials for what they think are missed calls . <p> " This goes on in games for fourth-graders , " Mano says . " It 's crazy . Parents will send tapes to the commissioners of small high school conferences and demand that they review them . They do n't do that . It is n't the NFL . When the game is over , we move on . We have to move on . " <p> That 's harder to do at the pro and top college levels , where the media scrutinize replays in excruciating detail . An official gets one look at live speed ; TV allows multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are normal people working in an abnormal environment , " NHL referee Stephen Walkom says . <p> Instant replay is not new , but the ability to slow a replay and see it in magnified , precise detail has improved markedly over time . The result is that officials are held to an impossible standard . <p> " We have to be perfect the day we begin , " college basketball official Rick Hartzell says , " and get better from there . " <p> The NFL and NHL use replay in limited circumstances to help officials get calls right . College basketball uses it in limited circumstances that Hartzell hopes will be expanded . Replay can be used at the end of games and overtimes to see when time expires ; he wants it available at the end of a half as well . <p> " Technology has changed officiating  --  so big , so televised , you ca n't afford to make a single mistake , " says an NFL official who seeks anonymity because of the league 's policy to limit what officials can say publicly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded , and more and more things are heaped on the officials by the league . " <p> Mike Pereira , the NFL 's director of officiating , agrees the focus on officiating has intensified over the years as technology has come into play . " More plays are stopped and rerun and looked at six or seven times , " he says . " I think it 's a good thing . It challenges officiating to improve . " <p> Scrutiny from all corners <p> The NFL says its officials get about 98% of calls right . But when officials get noticed , it is almost always for close calls that are controversial even when they 're correct  --  or for those rare mistakes . The NFL acknowledged last month that its officials missed a pass interference call that could have changed the outcome of the New York Giants-San Francisco 49ers playoff game . <p> " It 's like being a policeman , " NFL referee Johnny Grier says . " You 're going to make somebody mad no matter what you do . " <p> Grier , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks NFL officials ought to be able to talk to the media more freely . " The ( TV ) announcers have the attention of the country , and whatever they say is gospel , " he says . " And a lot of what they 're saying is 100% wrong . " <p> Game announcers and talk show hosts are not alone in pointing out errors , though . Sometimes the leagues go public , as the NFL did after the 49ers-Giants game . The Big Ten disciplined four officials last fall for what it termed substandard performance in Wake Forest 's 24-21 win against Purdue . <p> Yet Hank Nichols , the NCAA 's coordinator for men 's basketball officials , says the media magnify mistakes . " When you make a mistake like six guys on the court , it gets played on ESPN for five nights , " he says . " The mistake becomes more publicized and more glaring . " <p> Seattle Seahawks center Robbie Tobeck says it was n't always so . " When I was a kid you caught highlights on Monday Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly rehashed . " <p> And remembered for years . <p> " Every new season , baseball used to have a clean slate , " major league umpire Tim Tschida says . " Now fans are remembering things that happened last season  --  or five or eight years ago . I 've had strangers come up to me and want to talk about things that happened four years ago . As they are walking up to you , you see their face and you wonder , ' Who knows how serious this guy is ? ' " <p> Cleveland Cavaliers guard Ricky Davis thinks some NBA officials instigate incidents , at least to a small degree , with a chip-on-the-shoulder attitude . " Back in the day you could talk to the referees and approach them " about a call , he says . " Nowadays some refs are going to get a little offensive . That 's just the kind of referees you 're getting with the changing times . " <p> San Jose Sharks right wing Teemu Selanne has a more forgiving view of NHL officials . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . <p> But the camera does . And now replay is part of the game in some leagues , as in the NFL . Pereira says it is myth that replay intimidates officials . But he agrees that it has made football fans more critical of calls . <p> " I think they are less tolerant , " Pereira says . " And I will tell you that officiating is better than it was 15 years ago . It 's weighed against officials . Fumbles , dropped passes ; they 're part of the human element of the game . So is officiating . But we are held to a different standard . I think that is good . It forces us to strive for perfection . " <p> Perfection is n't possible . Even so , officials must have the final say even when they 're wrong : There is no court of appeals for a called third strike . <p> Contributing : Kevin Allen , Mel Antonen , Mike Brehm , Roscoe Nance , Larry Weisman and Steve Wieberg
