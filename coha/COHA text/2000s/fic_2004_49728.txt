FOR MY BIRTHDAY LAST WEEK MY HUSBAND GAVE ME a silver CD by Charlotte Church , that little Welsh angel , along with the once-a-year gold-boxed Godiva chocolates tied up with their little elastic gold string . From our daughter Tasha , away at school , there was also , in white tissue , a cream-colored silk blouse I 'd unsubtly mentioned a couple of months before ; really I knew Ben had bought it . This sometime uxoriousness does not manifest publicly , much . He 's a low-key man and , moreover , a Presbyterian pastor . <p> I settled into the worn chaise longue in our room with an old book from my father 's library , thinking vaguely with my fingers that the piping on the cushion edges was fraying . Fraying : a wonderful phenomenon , I thought , a kind of tasteful aging of our material surroundings , set aside in our peripheral vision . I had planned to let the music play in the background as I read , but as quickly as it began I set the book down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Charlotte Church 's voice-trained beyond its own capacity , weak in spots no one acknowledges , but so human and finite in that very weakness , my own alter ego-led me through Andrew Lloyd Webber 's " Pie Jesu , " so spacious , so stark . I felt-with my chaise longue , my blouse , and my chocolates-like a terrible heathen and hedonist . I took a moment in the space between songs-not long enough-to blink my eyes slowly and mourn anything in my life for which I had riot been sufficiently grateful . That voice moved into " Panis Angelicus , " Bread of Angels . <p> At that point I found myself on the verge of tears . I put my left hand to my throat and sat holding on as if I were going to fly apart , at that imagined seam between my head and my body . I thought unaccountably of Elsa Lanchester in that ancient black-and-white Bride of Frankenstein . Had I been put together from spare parts ? What in the world did I mean , thinking of that ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the player . I stood at the window and stared down at the avenue . The sun was too bright . The white roses climbing the fence were so densely creamy white on the glossy green bushes it hurt my heart , like a fork . Which made no sense at all : roses like a fork . <p> Then I remembered Father Brauer : ah , now I understood . He was why I had started to cry . Father Brauer died in New Orleans , where I grew up , the year Ben and I graduated from college . That was four years after my father died . I had been stoic , impassive , at both of the funerals . I decided that finally now I was mourning , and that , comically unaccountable as her image might be , Elsa Lanchester was there to aid me in mourning . The trail of crumbs in my mind 's moonlight led back from " Panis Angelicus " to the remembered sight of Father Brauer at the altar , the white , quick-dissolving Communion wafer the size of a half-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As Charlotte Church made her way through " Panis angelicus , fit panis hominum , " I was remembering the year that I met Father Brauer . At the back of the Mater Dolorosa schoolyard , the gate that led out to Dublin Street was of wrought iron , painted over again and again in rich deep dark green till in some places its detail was almost obscured . Its high shallow arch , twined with dried-brittle ivy leaves , bore in wrought iron a Pieta-like figure of the veiled Blessed Mother with Jesus limp , dead , weightless , laid out like laundry across her arms . Pauper , pauper , servus et humilis . <p> I did not know what was hidden there in the detail until one Saturday morning when we had just finished majorette practice for an upcoming Mardi Gras parade not far across town . I believe it was the Krewe of Freret . I stood legs apart , transfixed , astraddle the low girl 's bar of my bicycle-a turquoise Columbia model with white-and-gold handgrip streamers that flowed in the wind-just outside the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was watching the gardener rip the dark , papery , wiry dead ivy away . My baton was strapped tight to my handlebars by means of a clever device that the gardener-who was more practical than my father-had concocted from screw-on bicycle-horn parts . He called it a gizmo . With his accent , it sounded like " yissmo . " <p> I was wearing my black silk zip jacket : it had CATS scrolled across the back in big gold embroidery-thread letters , and the slim silhouette of an appliqued cat with its tail in the air curling up like a question mark . The CATS were our twirling team , Miss Carmel Ann Torres 's majorettes . I had been studying with Miss Carmel Ann for three years now , ever since I was in second grade , and I was one of her top twirlers . I could throw my baton into the air , make it twirl several times up there against the white-blue of the overcast sky while on the ground I was swirling around like a Russian dancer . I could touch my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head as if I were a hummingbird . It was a simple routine move . <p> The lessons were expensive , but then there was only me , nobody else for my father to spend money on . Alanna Doubilet , in my class , whose father was a dentist , asked me if I were rich . She was trying to decide who to ask to her birthday party , because she was rich . I said no , that I was an orphan , that I lived in the carousel shelter at Audubon Park and robbed Katz and Besthoff drugstores in a Lone Ranger mask on the weekends . It amazes me to look back at what a wry , sour child , like morning mouth , I must have seemed then . I heard afterward that her party was fun . I recall at the time I cared little . <p> When the gardener finished and took down his ladder to move on to some other chore in the rectory garden-likely to the cleaning of the shell-shaped fountain that seemed always to be clogged with flower petals-I moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in wonder . Dead Jesus , his mother there holding him-slack and lank as an old blanket-sorrowing . I got on my bike and rode wild and reckless down the center of Dublin Street , twelve blocks home . <p> My father , Darius Fortier , full professor of art history at Dominican College , had student papers in blue-ink Palmer hand spread out across the cutwork tablecloth that covered the dark wood of the dining-room table : a stack of those he had already finished , a stack of those yet to be read and marked up , and another stack . The cutwork embroidery thrust its lumps under the paper , under the heel of his hand , and made it impossible to write , so he wrote on a breadboard he brought in from the kitchen each time he worked , then stashed neatly back in the drawer with the wooden spoons . <p> I said again what I kept saying to him , like a little nag : You could take off the tablecloth , Daddy . You really could . He said back what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything : Your mother would n't like that . The pressure of writing on it would mark up the table . And I replied then what I always replied : She left six years ago , Daddy . She does n't give a good goddamn . My father said then , as he always did , half sternly , half sadly , " Saskia ! " <p> I did n't reply , as I normally did-this routine that we had-that I would prefer that he not call me that name . He had named me after Rembrandt 's wife , who had a porky pale face and goggling eyes like a premature baby 's . I felt at that moment that not responding gave me more power . So I ignored him . I wanted to be called by my middle name , Jane . I flounced off to my bedroom and threw myself onto the four-poster bed in a funk , in a bicycle sweat . I stared straight up at the pale organdy canopy . I thought : Not about anything , Daddy , she did n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Certainly not about the dining-room table , six years back into the mists of prehistory . <p> I thought of the Sorrowing Mother above the school gate , the mother who stood at the foot of the cross , the mother who stayed . I wondered if my mother was happy . She had gone to South Carolina , my father thought . He said she had had a friend there , whose name he did n't remember ( this father of mine with the photographic memory that was the bane of all his students ) . He said that although my mother had never been there , she talked about it with some longing , as if South Carolina were paradise . <p> I imagined her on the Atlantic , beach there , in a two-piece red polkadot swimsuit I 'd seen in a photograph with scalloped edges . The swimsuit had smart tidy bows at her hipbones , another one in the valley between her breasts . The photograph was black and white but my father had told me that the swimsuit was a bright cherry red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vividly cherry red . She had worn this swimsuit the year my father met her and married her , the last year of the war . When I think of that picture , her curls seem to be bouncing , as if it were a motion picture . Perhaps I once dreamed that . <p> Miss Carmel Ann Torres in some ways reminded me of that picture of my mother . Her hair was the color that my mother 's in black and white seemed to be , sort of a butterscotch blonde , like the fat butterscotch lozenges I bought in rolls at the Piggly Wiggly . She had been Miss Plaquemines Parish the year she had graduated from high school , three or four years before she came to New Orleans to teach baton . Now she lived in a little apartment on Oak Street , upstairs from Fran 's Fabric Store , just around the corner from school . I thought that was romantic and cozy . Once she mentioned that her living room had cream-colored wallpaper printed with wild roses climbing up trellises . " Floor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring her my lesson fees one time-well , I did n't have to , but I wanted to see how she lived and I hoped she 'd invite me in , give me a glass of Coke or maybe minted tea , with real mint leaves , and lots of ice cubes that would melt far too quickly but still give me time to talk . I stood under the high bare bulb in the hall-there were three other apartments up there-and I tried to peer in , but it just looked like plain pale green walls to me . I figured she had meant to say her bedroom . <p> The fabric store downstairs smelled of textile dyes that made me swoon . I slithered like a sand shark down the aisles pressing my nose into the four kinds of white waffle pique , three dotted Swisses , the countless bolts of satins , sateens , peau de soies , and ethereal silks in the bridal section , sniffing loud and ecstatic inhales . The owner , Mrs. Frangiapani , came running at me-as she had several times before-with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goose , flapping her wings . You get out of here , you little motherless . . . She did n't know what to call me . She threatened to call Mrs. Glapion , the priests ' housekeeper , and tell on me . <p> I had a nosebleed one day at school . It was during arithmetic , and I was holding my head back and pressing Sister Madaleva 's huge industrial handkerchief to it-stiff as a tarpaulin , it seemed to me , and smelling of having been ironed . I thought about Mrs. Frangiapani and her gray goose act there amid the bolts of white fabric . I imagined being overcome by a violent nosebleed as I approached the bridal aisle . I laughed out loud . It sounded amazingly like a donkey 's bray . Several people in class turned and stared at me . Even Georgie Keyes , renowned for acrobatic acts with his boogers , was filled with self-righteous amazement . Sister Madaleva , at the board , stopped in the middle of making the loop of a two in a yellow-chalk multiplication problem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with the problem . She was teaching us to carry numbers and writing small superscripts in her impeccable nunly hand . The answer was 4,473-I remember that . <p> Mrs. Glapion had been a kind of aunt or grandmother to me at a second or third remove since I started school . My father had made an agreement with Monsignor Schallau that I could hang around the rectory , playing in the unused old wallpaper-paste-smelling parlor on rainy days , sometimes helping Mrs. Glapion , because my father had to be at the university until dinnertime . Monsignor Schallau had been friends with my father for years , since before he had married my mother . <p> After she left , when I was four and five , my father and I had come visiting at the rectory on Sunday evenings . My father would wear a straw hat most of the year , and often when we visited the rectory I would carry a little umbrella imprinted with pansies . When we entered the rectory , he would hang his hat on the wall peg and I would stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and umbrella seemed so ornamental and useless , but it was a liturgy of a kind . <p> My father and the monsignor drank brandy in cut-glass tumblers on these visits , in the back parlor , and talked quietly , seriously , leaning together , the smoke of Monsignor Schallau 's cigar wreathing them . Meanwhile I sat on the rose-figured rug cutting pictures from back issues of Catholic magazines , Extension and The Sign . I sometimes watched Ed Sullivan on the television Monsignor Schallau had in his bedroom . The room smelled of cigarette ashes and some kind of priest soap or aftershave . When one or the other of the men asked me to , I would do an Ed Sullivan impression that made Monsignor Schallau slap his thighs , in the skirt of the full-length black cassock he always wore . The sound was like that of a canvas tent hit by the wind . <p> That day I came home from baton-twirling practice and threw myself onto my bed , I lay twitching and tapping my feet against the headboard until my father came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We are going to the rectory for dinner tonight , Sassy , " he said . " The new assistant pastor has arrived . " <p> The former assistant pastor , a red-headed priest named Father Malachy Reilly , had been transferred to Saint Roch 's parish way across town . At Saint Roch 's there was a shrine heaped with old polio braces and built-up orthopedic shoes from people who 'd been healed of cripplings by Saint Roch 's efficacious intercession . Father Reilly was replacing an assistant pastor at Saint Roch 's who had been sent to Mandeville , a still-green paradise across Lake Pontchartrain . <p> There was a mental hospital at Mandeville . It was filled-I was told-with crazy people in blue-striped uniform pajamas who walked around blubbering and twiddling their fingers and pulling at their eyelids . I had gone to the mirror and done that myself when I heard the tale long before . It was wonderfully gruesome . I asked if that was where Saint Roch 's assistant pastor had gone , and my father raised his left eyebrow at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caterpillar I 'd watched crawl around my leg at a picnic at Dominican College . All the silly Dominican girls meanwhile fluttered around my father- " Professor Fortier , this " and " Professor Fortier , that . " Finally a couple of dozen or so of the caterpillar 's legs seemed to let go , as if it were tired of me and moving on . It dropped to the ground and then moseyed away . It had itched terribly at the time but I would not let on . <p> " No , Saskia , " my father said evenly . " He has not gone to the insane asylum . He has gone to a very nice parish there , " he said , " where the old pastor retired . It 's a promotion . " <p> This change-this rearrangement , promotion , whatever it was-all seemed to me random dominoes falling in sinuous rows . It was in such stark contrast to Sister Madaleva 's insistence that the Church was the one stable thing in a turning world , every Mass everywhere said in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pope , the dour , hatchet-faced Pius XII . <p> " The new priest has arrived and we 're going to meet him , " my father said . " Wear that nice dress with the brown . . . " he gestured at his own shoulders , a pantomime of suspenders or straps . I had no idea what dress he meant . I wore a brown sweater and skirt , an attempt to please him with the only brown clothes I could think of , and because they were too heavy for the evening I perspired profusely . <p> At dinner that night we had Sauerbraten , Monsignor 's favorite . There were little peppercorns everywhere in the dish , and I had to keep picking them off my lips like little fat bugs . The new priest had been sent from Germany , too . His name was Franz Xavier Brauer , and I liked him immediately . He had twinkly eyes , and he could do tricks with cards . He had been a priest for eleven years . In contrast to the gray of my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich chestnut brown . <p> After dinner , while Monsignor Schallau and my father sat in the back parlor in conversation-I wondered what they could have to talk about , all these times-Father Brauer and I sat half-watching them through the archway from the music room , getting acquainted . It seemed that my father and the monsignor had something important they needed to talk about , and I was to entertain the new assistant . <p> He taught me to say funny things in a German throat-gurgling growl . He was from Greifswald , he said , in the North , " near the Oder Lagoon and the Bay of Pomerania . " He leaned close to me when he said these names , in the same posture as my father and the monsignor , as if we were conspiring . He knew I would not know these names , and that nevertheless I 'd pretend to . " Ah , there ! " I said , as if I had been there and knew everyone 's business , and we laughed , and we were friends . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Brauer told me he had always known he 'd be a priest , that his parents had had a son die before him , that the son had been named Jakob . That his mother , in exchange for his birth , had then promised him to God as a priest , as Hannah had promised Samuel in the Old Testament . That his father had died when he was fifteen and he did n't want to disappoint his mother . That actually he 'd been afraid it might kill her if he did not enter the seminary . I heard an odd minor chord in his voice . He said that now he thought his mother would live forever , and there was an even odder tone to that . <p> Father Brauer had two German coins in a hidden pocket of his cassock . He placed them under a pair of pale green thin-china teacups on the endtable next to us and had me move them around . Then he said something in Latin and extracted the coins from my hair , always slightly wild-curled and awry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ouch ! " I said , putting my hands to my hair . <p> My father stirred in his chair in the next room , peering through the smoke , through the glass of the French doors . " It 's OK ! " I assured him , too loudly . I pounced my hands over the teacups . I was sure the coins were still there and that he had a duplicate pair he 'd produced . But I picked up the cups , and the coins were gone . <p> The following week Miss Carmel Ann Torres told us she would give us , her girls , a fire-baton demonstration on Friday , because we had begged her . She said it looked best in the dark , so she asked us if we could come back after dinner . My father , who rarely questioned me about these things , leaving me generally to my own devices , asked , " Saskia , what is the utility of this ? " <p> I echoed , " Utility ? " <p> He said , " Usefulness . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel my lips pursing . I decided instead of engaging with him I would simply go look at myself in the hall mirror to see what I looked like exasperated . I was actually rather pleased . <p> Then I went into my bedroom and sat on my bed . I thought of Miss Carmel Ann Torres 's batons glowing in the twilight , flying high , zooming earthward : the catlike retrieval , the segue into the next lissome move . I was so angry at his question I went to my closet and put on my orange rubber swim fins , my frog feet . I clomped around the waxed floor of my bedroom in them . I thought about those batons , soaring like comets . <p> I went to my closet again and took out my swim mask . I put it on . I walked a sullen , rubber-flapping figure 8 , thinking of that word , utility . I thought , in an inchoate , animal way that had no words to hold it yet : my father of all people should understand beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father appeared in the door and leaned wearily on the frame . He looked at me as if he might send me to Mandeville . " Go , then , " he said shortly . <p> Friday afternoon I told Mrs. Glapion that I was n't going home at the normal time , that Miss Carmel Ann Torres was twirling her fire batons for us . I said I was going to the Katz and Besthoff drugstore for dinner by myself , that I had money for a triple-decker club sandwich and a fountain Coke , and that I would eat at the counter and leave a tip . She stared at me in the way people often did . She said caiolingly , " You can perfectly well eat here if you are not going home . We are having that good shrimp stew . You always have three helpings . " Mrs. Glapion was from the country , near Abbeville . <p> It was at that point that I remembered it was Friday . It still was considered a mortal sin to eat meat on Friday . Jesus would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon , the gates of hell beckoning . I could still opt out of damnation . Mrs. Glapion had not yet realized what I had said : that I planned to eat meat . She was just being cookish in urging the shrimp on me . I smiled no thank you and left before there could be any more talk . <p> As I was leaving the rectory to walk the block to the drugstore , Father Brauer was coming across the schoolyard from somewhere . I told him about the fire-baton demonstration . I said it would be in the schoolyard at six and he ought to come . I wanted to tell him about what my father had asked me . Utility . I knew somehow that he would understand . He seemed a little distracted . He smiled and said he would see me on Sunday , then went indoors . <p> I ate my club sandwich , turkey and bacon and all , and I decided I was n't afraid of hell . The children at Fatima-Francisco , Jacinta , and Lucia-had had visions of hell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the movie the girl who played Jacinta was the same girl who was on the weekly TV show with Danny Thomas , Make Room for Daddy . Danny Thomas was Catholic , too . He collected for hospitals named for Saint Jude , where kids with impossible illnesses were cured and sent on to normal lives . <p> I felt my lower lip jutting out as I marched back to the schoolyard . I sat on the side steps of the church , which led up to the Holy Family altar with all its banks of guttering candles whose wax shaped itself into wild maenad shapes whenever the wind came in through the door . When I prayed at that altar my mind often meandered around in itself , making stories of the piled candle drippings . <p> Darkness had settled down wetly on everything by the time Miss Carmel Ann Torres appeared . She had only had to walk around the corner from Oak Street . My hair was damp and I sneezed several times . Miss Carmel Ann sighed . We waited awhile in silence . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had invited besides me , not Suellen or Gina or Wendy Marie , not Lynette and Lynelle , the twins , not even DeeDee Ducrosse , who always showed up because she worshiped the ground that Miss Carmel Ann walked on . <p> " I guess it 's the rain , " I said finally , shrugging apologetically . <p> " It 's just mist , " said Miss Carmel Ann . " It just makes a person wonder if they 're serious about twirling . " <p> There was something just right about that , and then again something just a little crazy . It was not unlike my father 's remark about usefulness : that is to say , at an oblique angle to what I thought was reality . <p> " I 'll be your audience , " I said brightly . <p> It was clear she wanted more than me . She made a sound in her throat that went deeper than a wasted evening and the loss of a little hoped-for adulation . <p> I pulled my brow together . " Wait ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I summoned Father Brauer . I said , " Look , her feelings will be hurt . Nobody came but me . " I smelled bacon on my breath and wondered if one good deed like this could cancel out hell , which seemed realer now in the spare high-ceilinged yellow-lit rectory vestibule . <p> He seemed no less distracted than he had seemed before , but he took his coat from the hall coat-tree and followed me out to the yard . We sat together in the damp air on the church steps and watched as Miss Carmel Ann Torres twirled fire batons in the dark . <p> There was no music , but there seemed to be : I could hear in the still-wet air a whole orchestra of violins and woodwinds , with a tympany crashing in now and again . They were playing the theme from Ben Hur . All Asia Minor and Rome , the judean hill country and the dust and blood of the chariot races and their treachery were clustering in the air over us . Miss Carmel Ann 's every move was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could be anywhere but Hollywood , or heaven . <p> Miss Carmel Ann wore a white satin leotard with feathery silk fringe down the backs of the wrist-length sleeves that dazzled in the firelight . The stockings that sheathed her legs were white , like a nurse 's , but sheer as could be , and her majorette boots were white , with white silk tassels . As she twirled she seemed to become a bird , a dove , the Holy Ghost . She was lit only by the single schoolyard light , above our heads , between us and the gate . <p> I looked over at Father Brauer and I saw on his face a look I had not seen there before , outside of the moment at Mass when he held up the Host at the Consecration , and the altar boys rang the tintinnabulating cluster of golden bells . Holy , holy , holy , rang the words in my head , but of course those were the words of the Sanctus , not the Consecration . <p> When Miss Carmel Ann finished her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse magic , that seemed-and she laid the batons on the church steps . I could still hear the imaginary orchestra , finishing , winding down into a postlude . " That 's all , " she said , shrugging . Her cheeks were pink from the exertion . Her toasty-gold curls sprang unruly in every direction , unloosed by the mist . <p> I clapped and shouted . Father Brauer reached out and shook her hand awkwardly . " Thank you , " he said , his grin wide and appreciative . " Very excellent . " In the odd light I could see that he was older than I had thought , likely my father 's age . There were crinkles around his eyes . <p> She packed up her things and went back to her little apartment around the corner . As she left the schoolyard through the Pieta gate , she looked back at us over her shoulder and waved with what seemed a kind of embarrassment , or perhaps bravado . At that moment she looked as if she belonged in my father 's books of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , in the way it did in big candles in church that had melted down inside and hid a protected flame . <p> I put my hand up to my hair . It was thoroughly wet . <p> I rode my bike home in the dark , with its silly , pathetic front light that did no good at all poking out rubbery into the mist . As I crossed Plum Street , I remembered which painting of Rembrandt 's I meant . It was The Adoration of the Shepherds . My father had left the book lying open on the table , and I had sat looking at it for some time the week before , leaning on my elbows on the embroidered cloth till they hurt . In the picture the baby Jesus seems to be the source of the light , and his mother is bathed in that light . Miss Carmel Ann Torres had been lit that way as she turned in the schoolyard gate to wave to us . It was only backlight from the streetlamp beside the old Woolworth 's store , diffused in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that moment-would surely have wanted to paint Miss Carmel Ann that way . <p> I passed by my father , who was reading in the weak light of a lamp in the living room . I waved , and for the first time , though we had always lived there in the same big raised house on Carrollton Avenue , and the furnishings never had changed , I noticed behind him on the wall a small dark print of Rembrandt and his wife . His wife wore a brown dress with a complex arrangement of straps about the shoulders . <p> In my room I lay on my back on my bed looking up at the dotted Swiss canopy , my hair soaking wet from the evening , till I fell asleep , thinking of nothing at all . <p> That summer I got sent to three two-week sessions in a row of the damp cabins , morning swims , afternoon naps , and mystery-meat dinners of Saint Scholastica 's camp in Bay Saint Louis , and my father went to New York to do work in museums . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was an orphan . In fact , I said , I had been sent here from a small duchy in Europe-I do remember saying that word-without a word of English . I added , " I think I am doing damned well , thank you . I am sure you can not detect even a trace of an accent . " She stared at me openmouthed . <p> My father wrote me faithfully , twice a week , short , dull letters on thin crisp paper the color of an overcast sky . I found it odd that for a man whose work was pictures , he described nothing to me in his letters : not the museums he worked in or anything about the paintings except their names , not the trees in New York , if there were trees , not the glamorous sky-scraping buildings or gorgeous iron or brass work on the buildings , not ferries or bridges or birds on the park statues . he seemed a man who had in many respects simply died when my mother left . I could hardly ever recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilled smile , and I felt triumphant then . <p> The first day of school-I had been home from camp only a week-I went to the rectory to see Father Brauer . Mrs. Glapion was wiping her hands , wiping , wiping , as if they would never come dry , on an apron embroidered with green leaves in cross-stitch . She looked at me strangely . I wiped at my mouth , wondering if I were wearing a mustache of chocolate from the Three Musketeers bar I had just eaten . I was n't . " Father Brauer is not here , " she said . <p> I asked when I should come back , because I had made him a leather pen case at camp with his initials stamped into it , FFB . I handed it to Mrs. Glapion . She turned it over in her hand . " His middle name starts with an X , " she said . " Franz Xavier . " <p> " Oh , no , " I said . " That is for Father Franz Brauer . " <p> " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact . . . " she stopped , seeming not to know what to say . She kept wiping her hands on her apron . " He is on retreat , " she said , with an odd tone to it . " Across the lake . " <p> Mandeville was across the lake . My mother 's defection had in some sense prepared me for every twist of events that would come down the halls of my life . It was not unthinkable that some slight shift in the wind could cause Father Brauer to lose his mind , an analogous event . I said , " Did he go crazy ? " <p> Mrs. Glapion 's eyebrows shot up . " Excuse me ? " she said . <p> I knew she had heard me , so I folded my arms and did not repeat myself . I just stood and waited . <p> " Well , " she said , clearing her throat . " In a manner of speaking . Some people are saying that . " Then she shut down and seemed to regret having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandeville ? " I demanded , shrill . " To the insane asylum ? " <p> " Saskia , please . I said he is on retreat . At Saint Benedict 's Abbey . " <p> I had been there . It was surrounded by piney woods , and the chapel was tall and cool . In Music we had had to sing a song , " I know a green cathedral , a shadowed forest shrine . " I always pictured Saint Benedict 's Abbey . " What did you mean about crazy ? " I demanded . <p> The telephone rang its annoying ring in the next room . She turned to go answer it , motioning me to leave and shut the door . But she turned back before she went through the French doors into the priests ' parlor and said , " You said ' crazy . ' I did n't . " Then she closed the doors , leaving me there in the overbright foyer alone . <p> I felt a shiver . Something was eerie in this-the phone ringing , the foyer too bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all this business about green cathedrals that was running through my head . <p> When I got home , my father was sitting in his accustomed place working on papers . I blathered all this at him . " Saskia ! " he said . " Settle down ! " His tone was harsh . " You have been watching too many of those mystery shows . " he was referring to Inner Sanctum , whose opening sequence featured the sound of a creaking door , suggesting the imminence of every terrible possibility we could imagine , and more we could not . He just stared at me frostily . Parenting a daughter this " spirited " that was his word-was not natural to him , and at times he clearly felt it beyond his reach . " Father Brauer is , just as Mrs. Glapion told you , at the abbey on a retreat . Very simply . " <p> " She said some people thought he had lost his mind , " I said . <p> He stood up and pushed his chair back . " Who ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . I tried to set my tin lunchbox down onto the top of the lace-scarfed credenza and missed , pulling the scarf off and denting the lunchbox as it fell . I harrumphed and my father made a small noise of impatience , such as a woodchuck might make , in his throat . " Anyway , " I nearly shouted , " if you knew , why did n't you tell me ? " <p> " Sit down , " he said , softer now . He sat down himself and waited till I did . Then he explained . It seemed Father Brauer was feeling somewhat uprooted , having come over from Germany . It seemed he had decided he wanted . . . My father faltered . " He says he plans to leave the priesthood , " my father said . " Monsignor Schallau has sent him away for a short time to pray about the matter . " He paused . " This is not the way this is done , " he added . <p> " The way what is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a book . I expected him to adopt diction appropriate to that , to tell me perhaps that Father Brauer would be gone for a fortnight . <p> He seemed to step aside from the question . " Father Brauer 's mother is very old , " he said . " It would not do her heart good to hear of this , so the monsignor insists that Frank think it through . " <p> " Frank ? " I said . Things seemed to be progressing pell-mell . " Did you say Frank ? " I said . <p> I remembered the last time I had seen Father Brauer at Mass , turning in his stately , awed manner to face the congregation with the consecrated Host , speaking the words of Christ like a ventriloquist , This is my body , in Latin . Hoc est enim corpus meum . <p> Father Brauer-unlike Monsignor Schallau , who was as methodical as a gas-station attendant-always seemed transported at Mass when he raised the Host high . At that precise second , the altar boy at the foot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sounded like stars falling onto the desert near Bethlehem , to mark the transformation of the bread to the Body of Christ . <p> This , Father Brauer had said to me one evening while the monsignor and my father were in the next room , wreathed by and shrouded in their own cigarette smoke , is that for which I became a priest : the connecting of the Eucharist . It seemed such a strange word , connecting . I had heard of confectioners ' sugar , but that was my sole association for the word . Thus the Eucharist , in that context , sounded sweet , like a dessert . <p> Well , it is , Father Brauer had said when I told him that : the very Bread of Angels . <p> My father would talk no more and sent me away . I kept blabbering and calling to him until finally when I went back into the dining room I saw he had left the house entirely . <p> It was two weeks or so before we knew what had happened , at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who told us . It was our first twirling lesson of the new school year , upstairs in the new gymnasium because it was raining outdoors . She said , " I have an announcement to make , my little catties . " We loved that , when she called us her " catties . " <p> She held out her left hand , on which she wore a new sparkly ring . Her fingernails were freshly manicured , with a coating of coral pink polish that we knew was called Persian Melon . Wendy Marie and Suellen had gone halves on a bottle of it at Katz and Besthoff the week before , and we all painted our stubby nails with it , to be like Miss Carmel Ann Torres . The ring held a fat pearl and some little blue stones twining around that . " I 'm engaged , " she said . We all squealed and mobbed her . <p> Then she sat us down and said she had something trickier to tell us . " You may hear unpleasant things about your teacher now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible things .. . bad words . " We ran through all the bad words we knew , in our heads . She saved us the trouble . " A lady in the Altar Society called me a minx . And a slut . " I had never heard the word minx . I assumed that it ended in ? as Xavier began with an x . I resolved I would look it up . <p> " Just for getting engaged ? " said Lynette Charbonnet . <p> " For getting engaged to Frank Brauer , " said Miss Carmel Ann . She tipped her head slightly , in a way that bespoke smug delight . <p> It did not seem to register with anyone else but me : I swung my eyes sidewise , checking all the faces . I had developed this habit as a result of my father 's refusal to talk about things as much as I would like . Further , I had watched too many Westerns : I thought of myself as an Indian scout with rny ear to the ground for the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for the scent of someone from another tribe , in pungent-smelling moccasins , coming toward me across the packed earth : a brave , no doubt , with alien-oiled hair , with oddly spiced venison breath , and a quiver full of perfectly pointed arrows . <p> " Father Brauer ! " I yelped . I knew priests could not marry . <p> " Well , life is more complicated than some of these . . . ladies in the church want to think , " she said . There was a hard , dissonant edge to her voice . It seemed angry . <p> " Are they going to fire you ? " I said . <p> She laughed out loud . " No , " she said . " You do get right to the point , do n't you ? " Lynette Charbonnet was still several miles back there , trying to figure out what was going on . <p> When I went home , my father was in the kitchen making himself a cup of warmed-over coffee . He looked over at me-he could see all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even ask . " <p> " What ? " I demanded , all innocence . <p> He raised that eyebrow , and indeed I did n't ask , because the question was the size of a small solar system , and certainly not our own . <p> Our twirling lessons continued , upstairs in the gym , and the following month Miss Carmel Ann Torres showed us a new ring , plain gold , tucked just beneath her engagement ring . We knew that her last name had changed but we called her simply Miss Carmel Ann now . We were still the CATS . <p> I said one day to Lynette Charbonnet , when we were packing up our gear , " After all , it would n't make much sense for us to be the CABS , would it ? " She looked at me thickly . I did n't know what to say next . " Stupid costumes , " I said . " Yellow , with a little light up on top that says TAXI . " Lynette 's jaw hung slack . I could almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was three months down the road that I next saw Father Brauer . I had no idea what a priest who is no longer a priest would be doing if he was not being a priest , though I wondered about it . My father was hardly forthcoming , and no one else would have answered me at all . I went to Scarpetta 's Bakery on the corner of Oak and Dublin , catercorner from the school block , to get a cinnamon bun after First Friday morning Mass . We had to fast before Communion , and after Mass we were allowed a brief breakfast break . <p> I stood in line at the bakery , and as I handed my money up to the hairnetted lady , I saw Father Brauer in profile as he passed by the door , out back , carrying a huge tray of fresh-baked rolls . He was wearing a white paper cap like a chef 's , except not as stately and pouffed out and tall . <p> I could feel my own jaw hanging slack , but my skull was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took my roll and my waxy little carton of milk back to the school yard and ate sitting on my bookbag looking up at the Pieta over the gate . That night I asked my father if he knew that Father Brauer was working at the bakery . <p> " Well , " he said slowly . " Yes . Yes , I did . " He did not seem to want to say anything more . <p> " That makes no sense at all , " I said . " He 's a priest . " <p> " Well , he was , " said my father . " I guess that that little Miss Plaquemines Parish put paid to that . " <p> " It ca n't be that easy , " I said . " To get kicked out . " <p> " Yes , it can , " he said . he looked over at me and the eyebrow went up . <p> I ignored the eyebrow . I said , " That 's just stupid . He still loves God . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but no , I really do n't know how he could have done this . That trollop . Our God is a jealous God . " <p> I said , " The guy who 's the priest at the Methodist church has a wife . That was in the New Orleans Item last Tuesday . I saw her . She 's got kind of big teeth . " I made a face like a cartoon beaver . I wanted to make him laugh . <p> " Go to bed , Saskia , " he said . " Methodists have no priests . " <p> My father no longer met with the pastor as often on Sunday evenings now . The defection of Father Frank had made them both crabby and sour , for different reasons . Monsignor Schallau had a brand-new assistant who seemed to me rather a dim bulb . I would joke with him when I saw him in the schoolyard and he would never understand I was joking , so I stopped . <p> The parish was running through assistant pastors , I overheard my father say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That was very unlike him . I covered my mouth and guffawed . His caterpillar-eyebrow waggled a warning at me , and I left the room quickly . <p> Our baton-twirling lessons went on as usual , and I was now learning to twirl fire batons . I knew I could win at the local level-Miss Carmel Ann 's students always did , because she taught us little moves-how to toss our hair , how to hold our shoulders , how to look directly into the eyes of the judges in a way that connected them to us , committed them to our success , made them vote for us . I trusted that I would be sent on to the state level . <p> A lady who lived behind Walgreen 's drugstore at the bend of the river was already making my costume . It was covered with emerald green sequins everywhere-seven thousand of them , I estimated , sewn on one by one , though the seamstress was legendarily swift at her sequins-and it had a high mandarin collar . The finals would be in October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me pick the pattern . She was nicer to me that day , as I was buying . My father had given me money for it-he was distracted , preparing a multiple-choice exam , which always took him a lot of time-without even realizing that I had no earthly assurance that I 'd go to the state competition . <p> When I walked on Oak Street , I always looked up at the windows of Father Frank and Miss Carmel Ann 's apartment . There were louvered wood shutters inside one , and thick dark-green drapes pulled shut over the other . I did n't know what I was looking for anyway . This was a terrible mystery . I felt in some ways as I felt when I tried to see inside the tabernacle at Mass when the priest was not in the way : what did I think I would see , the beating heart of the mystery ? I tried to think of an excuse to go up there . I wanted to try one more time to see that trellised wallpaper . Something about that still bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she tell us some ladies had called her a slut ? " <p> He cleared his throat and pursed his lips . " You know what that word means ? " my father said . <p> " Yes , " I said , and tossed my head . " Suellen Maggiore told me they said that . She said it 's not true . " <p> " No one in the parish has ever known a priest to leave , " my father said . His eyes seemed to search the air above my head , as if trying to remember whether anyone else in his memory knew , even secondhand , of such defection . <p> " He 's right here , " I said . " He 's in the bakery . And anyway , Father Reillyleft . " <p> " That 's not the same thing , " said my father . He sighed . " Father Reilly was transferred to Saint Roch 's . The bishop transferred him . " <p> " Do people 's legs really grow back ? Gina Lemieux says they do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrine of Saint Roch when hers grew back . It had gotten cut off by a train out in the Rigolets when she and her cousin Bubba were playing on a rail- " His intense nonresponse shut me down , like a mattress thrown over me , knocking me to the ground . <p> Then he said , " There is something very strange about a woman setting her cap for a priest in the way she did . " <p> " Cap ? " I said . <p> " Saskia , " said my father , " do you think you could make me a cup of hot milk ? Without scorching it ? " <p> " Hmph , " I said , and I went to get out the double boiler . Who did he think I was , the Little Moron ? <p> It was during the following summer that Miss Carmel Ann disappeared . We did not hear about it until school opened , and then there was no direct announcement , iust the news that the CATS were no more . Disbanded . Defunct . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispers was the incontrovertible fact that Miss Carmel Ann had , not to put too fine a point on it , up and left Father Frank . <p> Then DeeDee Ducrosse , barreling toward us across the schoolyard asphalt at lunchtime recess , announced , breathless , " Miss Carmel Ann sent me a postcard ! " She held it out to us . It was a glossy photo of the beach at San Pedro , California , not very attractive . The sand looked hard and dry , like brown sugar too long in the pantry , and the beach seemed to stretch on forever , with an occasional pale sullen beach umbrella stuck into the ground . The ocean was glassy , a brilliant turquoise . There were no people anywhere , just pale buildings off in the distance . <p> We waited expectantly , in the three seconds between DeeDee 's announcement and our reading the back of the card , to learn some news . Then we stared at the card . Miss Carmel Ann had said nothing except " Hi from California " with three exclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dot over each i and put smiles and squinchy eyes inside the two little o 's . <p> " Maybe she 's going to Hollywood , " DeeDee said . " Esther Williams did real good , you know , with that swimming stuff . Maybe they 're going to make some baton-twirling movies now . That would be nice . " She looked distracted and peevish and uncertain . Then she offered another hypothesis , flat , uninflected . " Maybe she 's coming back . " The minute she said it her eyes took on a hollow look . She knew we would never see Miss Carmel Ann again . <p> My father sat at the dining-room table in the lengthening shadows , correcting tests on the breadboard and stacking them neatly in piles . This was quicker work than usual , since these were his multiple-choice tests . His head waved from side to side like a plant in an aquarium , slowly . I almost expected to see little angelfish swimming across his face , past the pink rims of his ears , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was trying to answer the question I 'd put to him months before , about why Miss Carmel Ann had charmed Father Frank into marrying her , and now the additional question of why she had left him . Perhaps he was wishing those questions were multiple-choice , too . " Some women . . . " He began . He stopped and started again . " Sometimes people . . . " he said . <p> " Do you think maybe Miss Carmel Ann got bored ? " I said . " Because Father Frank was so serious ? " My father was staring at me as if he did not know who I was . " Miss Carmel Ann was n't so serious . Was she ? " <p> " Saskia , " my father said , " you are a very bright girl . And you 're serious , are n't you ? " <p> I was n't sure at that moment what all I was committing to , but later on when I thought back to that moment it seemed sacramental , far more adult and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the following year , and for which Mrs. Glapion bought me a terrible veil with a 1930s pouf at the crown . " It looks like a shower cap ! ! " I would moan . " Nobody else will wear one like this . " She would shush me . " You 're beautiful . " <p> I recall nodding my head in answer to my father 's question-the nod was solemn-that Yes , I was serious , whatever that meant . I remembered the imaginary angelfish and black mollies , waving their gauzy fins through the air as my father sat working . I recall having gone , afterward , to my room , where the green-sequin costume for the state finals-to which I would never progress , of course , now that Miss Carmel Ann was gonehung against the wall , inside a zippered bag , and I recall sitting on the edge of my bed staring at the zipper as if Miss Carmel Ann herself would step out , and explain it all , with her fire batons twirling messages in the dusk of my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a month . His old mother had died , and was anyone surprised by that , Mrs. Glapion said to anyone who would listen , after what he had done ? She left him a whole lot of money . <p> He bought a big raised house on Walmsley Street and moved into it , all alone . He bought himself a dog , a sad-eyed Weimaraner . He named the dog John Pius . He did not have to work at the bakery anymore , but he often came back to the parish with John Pius , who seemed to like cinnamon buns more than anything . He said the walk to the parishalmost exactly a mile each way-was just right . <p> When Frank Brauer died , the house and the rest of his mother 's money , which was substantial , went to the diocese . John Pius went to the retired priests ' home , to eat their cinnamon buns and to pad around looking morose , his toenails clicking on the tile floors of the very long halls . <p> My husband Ben , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professor , as my father had been , though Ben 's field was history . I was aware I was doing what so many others have done , seeking out in a husband the father I had lost only two years before . I was pleased with my father , and unlike many women with fathers less than perfect , who repeat what was wrong with their lives-Lynette Charbonnet , whose father had drunk far too much and had twice hit her mother , married right out of high school to a man ten years older who drank and seemed sullen , and I saw her once in the Piggly Wiggly when I was a sophomore in college , with a gauze bandage taped to her forehead and her arm in a sling-I made a conscious choice to repeat what had been right in my life . Alanna Doubilet , daughter of a dentist , had married a dentist . It seemed tidy and reasonable . I decided that , on balance , I wanted that predictability , to balance what Alanna , after she had become my friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quiet , like my father Darius , though less sober . he was about my father 's height , though he walked with a springier step than I was sure my father had ever had . He had a meticulous handwriting like my father 's , which had always thrilled me , though his letters were more squared off . My father 's D looked as if it had been skated on ice-precise , perfect every time-by a professional skater in Holiday on Ice , which came to ice-free New Orleans each winter . Ben , signing his name to a check , would make the same infinitesimal preparatory loops in the air as my father had , before he set pen to paper , and the B he produced had an identical grace . The way he looked at me , quizzical and appreciative , as if he were not precisely sure where I had come from , seemed so like my father 's look . And so he won me easily . <p> We married when we graduated . The newest priest to come to the parish-a wizened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wedding was very small , with only Ben 's parents , who had flown seven hundred miles for the occasion , and a few of our friends . I wore a lavender blue suit and a little veiled hat . Ben 's haircut looked too fresh and raw . <p> Mrs. Glapion made a small but overwrought cake that looked as if it should not be cut into but set instead under moss-hung live oaks in a public park , as statuary , overlooking a wading pool where little children splashed and languid mothers lounged on the rims , chatting and sipping . She was flushed with pride at this . I complimented her effusively on the particulars-the plastic swans set into the frosting , the huge waves of white-sugar border , without ever saying I liked it . Immediately I not only felt guilty for my insincerity but persuaded myself that I loved the cake . <p> I had never been a hugger , nor had my father , but I made my way around the table to where Mrs. Glapion stood and put my arms around her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parish-hall women 's rest-room toilet . When she lifted her arms to hug me in return I smelled Mum Cream Deodorant . Over it all hung a fragrance of pineapple bread pudding . <p> As I hugged her she seemed as insubstantial as the underfilled pillows I was invariably given when we visited anywhere , as if she were collapsing into herself , as if she were all dress and no flesh . I remembered the monkeys in an experiment I 'd read about in a psychology class I had taken in college , a study on nurturing . Some monkeys were left with their real mothers , nursed and hugged ; others were given a wire-frame shape draped with fur and a red rubber nipple that stuck through the fur . Would the monkeys know the difference ? the experimenter asked . I thought : Would I ? <p> Then I thought : I am embarking upon my life , and I will have babies , and I will pay back what my mother has made off with , stolen from the treasury of mother love . I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Bowlby . I let go of Mrs. Glapion , whom I was crushing . I heard myself say Bowlby 's name out loud . " What ? " Mrs. Glapion said . <p> I noticed then that there were fat vases of blue hydrangeas set around the room . Mrs. Glapion said into my hair as she hugged me , " I picked all the flowers to match your dress , honey . From the rectory garden . " I pulled back from her and looked hard into her eyes . She had called me honey . I tried to remember if she had ever called me honey before in my life . <p> Suddenly I realized I 'd had three glasses of champagne in quick succession , in my thirst and my nervousness , and no food all day . " Oh , my , " I said , feeling my bones hollowing out , the air thinning . <p> " Does that mean you like them ? " she said . I did n't want to say , No , that means I am collapsing into myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were beautiful . <p> She said , " It 's because of the copper in the soil that they are so blue . " <p> The champagne reached the depths of my brain at that second . I tried to remember why she was talking about copper in the ground . I closed my eyes and made my way to a chair by the wall and sat down . " Oh , my , " I said again . <p> " I 'll get your husband , " Mrs. Glapion said . <p> At that moment , at the sound of that word , husband , I realized I had just risked everything in the world , or asked Ben to risk it . I had one second of sheer existential nausea , realizing that I had become the thing that had devoured my father 's life , a wife , a woman who held a man 's heart and life in her hands , and I was terrified of my own power . Then I stood up , was myself again , took up the ormolu cake knife and-Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or insane-sliced confidently into the cake like a goddamned professional bride . <p> In graduate school , Ben 's aims narrowed : his field would be intellectual history , specifically Northern European intellectual history . I worked in the dean 's office at the college , and we made ends meet . I looked forward to the day we could have a house of our own , when we knew where we would live . I looked forward to children . <p> Three years into graduate school , Ben came home one day and said he had something he wanted to say to me . He said that his work had led him to some inescapable conclusions , and that he was leaving the Church . I just stared at him . I had never known anyone who left the Church , and Ben had not given me any clue that this was coming . Then he said he wanted to go to divinity school , up east , that he 'd been offered a scholarship , and that he wanted my blessing . <p> " My blessing ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd seen of the new pope-John XXIII , chubby-cheeked architect of the Aggiornamento-giving an august , slow-motion papal blessing to a crowd from the balcony of his summer residence at Castelgandolfo . " My blessing ? " I said again . <p> " Oh ! " said Ben , seeing my astonishment . " You 're coming ! I did n't mean by myself , if that 's what you were thinking ! " he was waving his hands in the air , unaccustomedly , excitedly . That was n't what I was thinking , that Ben meant he 'd go without me . I was n't really thinking at all . He said , " All I mean is that this will change our life , Saskia . " I nodded solemnly . <p> It was in fact not at all clear to me what it would mean . I wanted to say , " There 's a new pope , Ben ! Things are changing ! " And yet I was asking things to stay the same . I knew Ben 's turn of mind was absolute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmness , even if he would catapult me right out of the Church with him . I just smiled in a way that must have looked silly . Protestants did n't even believe in the Eucharist ! It went against everything that I had always believed , and yet suddenly , in that split second , I knew it was right . I said , " Oh , Ben ! My blessing ! Of course ! " <p> I remembered Father Brauer 's ecstatic expression , consecrating the Host at Mass . I remembered him afterward , at Scarpetta 's Bakery , balancing trays of buns out before him , like a liturgy , passing the door as I stood at the cash register to pay . I thought : this is not what I bargained for . But I reminded myself , at some subterranean level of my brainpan , what I had come to believe : that in all likelihood my mother had left my father for just such a reason , that something in her expectations had not been met . What did she expect , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father had piles of papers , and he was not very entertaining . But did n't she know that before ? <p> I thought of Miss Carmel Ann 's lone postcard to us : an empty beach . What had she wanted : to prove that she could pry a priest from the priesthood , then drop him ? What changed , I thought , was that if that was the truth-and I was sure it had been-there was no more thrill . Her expectation must have been that the thrill of the terrible thing she had done would go on , and it did not . <p> Each night , in that little apartment , once she had married Frank Brauer , there was just this strange man now , who had lost everything for her sake , who kneaded the dough in the bakery instead of turning the tiny Hosts into the Body of Christ . All the glory had gone from him . How could she really-she must have thought-go on ( though she herself had been the catalyst for the transformation ) , how could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Connecticut and Ben started divinity school . <p> The following year I was diagnosed , at the age of twenty-five , with uterine cancer . A change of plans indeed ! The look that I saw on Ben 's face must have been the same look he had seen on mine when he announced his change of plans , with the terrible addition of the specter of Death hanging over me , waving its scythe like the fins of an angelfish . Ben treated me as if I were made of spun glass . I had the surgery , and everything soft and red inside of me moved around to fill the vacant space . <p> We of course never did have those children we 'd already planned and named : Carl Darius , after Ben 's father and mine ; Martin , for Luther , ( on hitherto-unexplored aspects of whose theology of grace Ben had then decided to write his ministerial thesis ) ; Caroline , after Ben 's mother ; and Jane , because I still thought it a nice name . We determined-it had been determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took on a pastorate in Pennsylvania . I went through a conversion of my own , in which I decided that perhaps this undoing of all my plans had not been chaos , but an intricate order , the order of grace itself . I prayed for a sense of where I belonged now , in this order . <p> One night after dinner we were sitting reading the paper . Ben dropped his section and said to me , " Did I ever tell you that my father was related to Ike Everly ? " <p> I said , " Who ? " I had been reading about an earthquake in the Middle East and thinking about what it might be like to be in the middle of that , and I could not refocus quickly enough . <p> " Ike Everly . Father of the Everly Brothers , " he said . <p> I said , " What on earth brought that up ? " <p> " Oh , something I read here , " he said . " On his mother 's side , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise me , " I said . <p> " Is that good ? " he said . " I 'm not sure how you mean that . " <p> " That 's good , " I said . " Very good . " I thought of one of my favorite snippets of scripture , the one Ben had used just the week before in his Sunday sermon . A piece from Isaiah , in which God says , " Behold : I am doing a new thing . " <p> I returned briefly to New Orleans to work with the lawyers to clear up my father 's estate , which surprised me by being considerable . There I crossed paths with Lynette Charbonnet Voss , who mentioned that everyone knew now that Miss Carmel Ann Torres had been married twice before Father Frank , and that she had left both of those men , too . She said that she thought DeeDee knew the details if I wanted them : she said she thought DeeDee had heard it from Miss Carmel Ann . She gave me DeeDee 's phone number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the Steen 's Molasses family . I folded it up and put it in the zipper pocket of my purse . I did not want to think about any of that , or acquaint myself with DeeDee in her new incarnation , or know more about Miss Carmel Ann than I already did . <p> For Ben and me , quickly as that , everything changed again . On a trip to the Soviet Union with a mission organization , we visited an orphanage , and there was a little girl off whom I could not take my eyes , because she would not take her eyes off me . I told the interpreter to ask the matron about her . She seemed about four . She had fluffy pale hair but dark eyes and an almost cafe-au-lait complexion . <p> The matron said through the translator , dismissively , that this one was not good , the offspring of a Finn from Karelia and , she thought , a Gypsy . She made motions with her hand like a foxtail brush , dusting the air . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that was the moment that I was convinced . <p> We adopted the little girl , our Tasha . She is nineteen now , and a sophomore at Mount Holyoke , studying , of all things , botany . Why do I say , " of all things " ? Everything is a surprise to me now . I had thought I could not live without replicating myself , somehow , replicating Ben , but this child has been such a surprise to us , such a gift . My friends tell me that their biological children astonish them too , are not clones . I know this . But still ! <p> In that moment in the stark , gray-lit hall of the orphanage , with its high ugly light fixtures lined with dead dried-out flies , that same feeling floored me : blessing , surprise . Had I not been open to the astonishment of each turn of events , I told myself every evening in the little-Catholic-girl prayers I continued to say as I drifted to sleep in Ben 's arms , I would have missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our calcified wishes and dreams-been in charge of the universe , what sorry , dull lives we would make for ourselves ! <p> Only last week , so many years later , I was reading and listening to Charlotte Church , as I said when I began . We had become , first , provisional Lutherans , then , in another odd turn , Presbyterians , and Yankees . Ben had entered a career other than what he intended , with diminished expectations in regard to worldly honor and wealth-though I can not today understand how I thought then that we could raise four children even on the salary of a professor ! Carl and Martin and Caroline and Jane had of course vaporized like the dew , but Tasha had come in their place . <p> What I was reading that day was an old powdery book of poetry that I had saved out from my father 's library . The smell of the pages made me sneeze . Then , while the Welsh girl sang , it all came together for me . I had begun praying recently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know her , he would reveal that and show me the way to effect such a meeting . At that second , with Charlotte Church filling the room , I wondered if Tasha 's birth mother were the Finn or the Gypsy , and I wished her well either way . <p> The chaise longue is placed such that morning and late afternoon , my favorite reading times , the light is perfect , a type of luxury no amount of money could ever buy . My father 's estate bought us a house in a good neighborhood near the church so that we did not have to live in the parsonage , which was a bit grand for me , and stark . We use that for church functions and offices . Our own house has French doors that open out onto the deck and a yard full of pin oaks and summer perennials , as well as a stream . We have not been back to New Orleans for over a decade . <p> I leafed through my father 's book and came to Shakespeare 's Sonnet 116 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Panis Angelicus . " I actually sobbed once , a catch in my throat . I am not a weeper . The single sob was for my father 's brown study of a life and the gray insubstantial fog of Father Brauer 's . I read the lines : <p> Let me not to the marriage of true minds <p> Admit impediments . Love is not love <p> Which alters when it alteration finds . <p> I remembered one infinitesimal moment a few years before we found Tasha when , observing Ben in profile as he addressed the congregation , with good colorless Presbyterian light filtering down across the pages of his sermon , I noted that the skin at his throat hung slightly loose , turkey-like . I thought , " My goodness , he 's an old man ! " He was not yet forty , but I could have argued myself into believing he was old and , moreover , despite the fact that we were the same age , into being offended by the fact . I felt young myself , and light . Since my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had taken my vitamins on an empty stomach and felt slightly bilious . My discontent was that simple . <p> I looked down at the sweater I wore that day-red as could be , not Presbyterian but rascally scarlet-and all the rebellion that was in the Saskia who flapped around the bedroom in the snorkel mask and rubber flippers rose up in me and decided-for just that split second-that I would leave Ben-my beautiful Ben , who at that moment was preaching a sermon called " God 's Design , " advertised on the bulletin board out in front of the church-and that I would start a new life . Within a millisecond in my head , I had jetted to both coasts-to South Carolina , and then to the ugly old beach at San Pedro-and to a number of other corners of the world , then returned to my seat in the pew where I always sat while my husband preached . <p> I knew it was only some version of this wretched dissatisfaction my mother had felt , and Miss Carmel Ann Torres too , and that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor husbands bereft and go off to their lives where , I had no doubt , they had found other men who were not perfect and left them , and so on and so on . And I knew I could do the same , and I did not . <p> When Ben came out after the service that day , he looked at my face and said , " You look as if you just swallowed the canary . " I smiled . I had just been to both coasts and back , as well as to other planets . We drove to a pancake house that day and ate pecan waffles with syrup pooled in their little square wells . <p> Three years later we found Tasha . Now she is grown and gone off to her Holyoke friends and her botany . <p> Yesterday , which was a Saturday , I woke up just before seven in an odd , incandescent state , the state of dream ready to slip away . I stayed motionless , waiting the dream 's return . It came back intact , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered the dream . <p> I was up on a balcony-Castelgandolfo , I knew , the pope 's fabled summer residence eighteen miles from Rome , though in a picture I 'd seen it was actually yellow , and here in my dream it was blue-and I was blessing the crowds , as if I were myself the pope . I was smiling broadly . There were pots of blue hydrangeas everywhere . <p> Down below , on the paving stones , there were jugglers and clowns , fools in harlequin bloomers , trick dogs . Father Brauer was passing a tray of warm cinnamon rolls with white frosting , and his Weimaraner John Pius padded lugubriously alongside him . In the dream I could smell the rolls , the spice , the buttery warmth . <p> Tasha was twirling fire batons down below , better than I had ever twirled . She had a real knack for it . She threw the baton so high I wondered whether it would ever return to earth . I watched it amazed . It did flips in the air , describing mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was night . The baton then began to descend . Tasha caught it with one hand . I was impressed . Her hair was her own , but also just like Miss Carmel Ann Torres 's , a resemblance I 'd never noticed . On the balcony , just out of the frame , there was a Gypsy woman in bangles and scarves trying to reach me and to hand me something small : a jewel , it seemed . I turned to look at her and knew she was Tasha 's birth mother . <p> My eyes were still closed . I did not want to lose this . I felt Ben 's hand sliding over to touch my hip . I covered it with my own to stay him a moment , to fully recover this . I lay perfectly still . Where was Ben in the dream , I thought . I moved Ben 's hand onto my stomach , quietly , under my thin cotton nightgown , and held on to it so that-for the next few seconds at least-he would not distract me from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the dream , but the real world . <p> Then I heard the tune Tasha was twirling to , and I saw that beside me there on the balcony in the dream were the Everly Brothers , Don and Phil . It was one of their faster , more rollicking songs-what , " Wake Up , Little Susie " ? -I could not hear it clearly . I opened my eyes for just a moment and started to laugh , and Ben looked me a question . " Just give me a second , " I said , and I moved his hand onto my ribcage . " It 's Don and Phil Everly , Ben , " I said . " Playing at Castelgandolfo . I 'm blessing the crowds . " Odd little tears of joy beaded up in the corners of my eyes . <p> " That 's perfect , " he said . I knew without seeing him that he then made the grin that he reserves for me . I knew he could see it all , see my dream too , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought , would I trade all of this-the dream , the reality-for what I 'd planned for myself , for the sake of a sense of control ? Don and Phil Everly playing at Castelgandolfo , indeed ! I would not . <p> I felt integral , seamless . Once more , stately , grateful for everything strange and unplanned in my whole life , I blessed the crowd : the Gypsy , the harlequin jesters , Frank Brauer with his cinnamon rolls . Then I opened my eyes and I turned to face Ben . <p>
