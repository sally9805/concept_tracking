Silence and the ignorance it promotes have fed the AIDS epidemic in Africa perhaps more than any other factors . In Malawi , where until the end of dictator Hastings Banda 's rule in 1994 women were barred from wearing short skirts and men could be jailed for having long hair , public discussion of AIDS was forbidden . According to the government , AIDS did n't exist inside Malawi . Catherine Phiri , 38 , knew otherwise . She tested positive in 1990 , after her husband had died of the disease . Forced to quit her job as a nurse when colleagues began to gossip , she sought refuge with relatives in the capital , Lilongwe . But they too shunned her and eventually forced her to move , this time to Salima on beautiful Lake Malawi .

President Bakili Muluzi incorporates AIDS education into every public rally . In 1999 he launched a five-year plan to fight the disease , and last July he ordered a crackdown on prostitution ( though the government is now thinking of legalizing it ) . At the least , his awareness campaign appears to be working : 90% of Malawians know about the dangers of AIDS . But that knowledge comes too late for the estimated 8% of HIV-positive citizens  --  800,000 people in 1999  --  or the 276,000 children under 15 orphaned by the disease . <P> Last October , Phiri picked up an award for her efforts from the U.N . But , she says , " I still have people who look at me like trash ... " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep I fear for the future of my children . But I will not run away now .
