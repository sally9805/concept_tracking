Section : Hands On MANAGING <p> AT CITY FRESH FOODS , CEO Glynn Lloyd likes to hire from the neighborhood . And because the 12-year-old food-service company is headquartered in Boston 's polyglot Dorchester neighborhood , Lloyd 's payroll resembles a mini-United Nations . Some 70 percent of his 65 employees are immigrants , from places like Trinidad , Brazil , Nigeria , the Dominican Republic , and Cape Verde , off the West Coast of Africa . They speak half a dozen languages , not to mention the myriad cultural differences . " Visitors can see that we 're a community of people from all over . They pick up on it right away , " says Lloyd , 38 . " You walk in , and you can feel the vibe of all those places . " <p> Immigrants will account for nearly two-thirds of the country 's population growth between now and 2050 , according to the U.S. Department of Labor . Minority groups will constitute almost half of the population by then , meaning that successful managers will have to understand how to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO could master . Indeed , while policymakers struggle to find an acceptable posture on border security , Lloyd has been working hard to figure out his own urgent question : How can managers best ensure that employees from so many different cultures work side by side productively ? <p> He 's come up with an ad hoc series of practices and processes that are achieving that aim . The highest hurdle , of course , has been communication . Lloyd tried overcoming it by providing about 40 hours of ESL classes to his workers so that all 65 of them would use English . But that bar seemed too high , so Lloyd has lowered it . Instead , he requires his employees to learn the more limited language of City Fresh Foods  --  terms like " delivery ticket , " " checkout sheet , " and " ice packs . " " I spend a little extra time trying to help them read what they need to know , " says Kurt Stegenga , the company 's logistics manager , who grew up in Mexico . " It takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refrigerator and know what it is they are grabbing  --  say , cream cheese and not cheese sticks . " But once they know those terms , productivity begins humming , Lloyd says . <p> At monthly companywide meetings , meanwhile , multilingual employees volunteer to serve as translators . Rosemary De la Cruz , a 26-year-old administrator from the Dominican Republic , sits next to employees who need the Spanish version and translates . Delivery manager Jose Tavares makes notes about his department meetings ; his assistant translates them into Portuguese and Spanish for the company 's 26 drivers . He 's also ready to jump on the phone and solve any problems that might occur when an immigrant driver can not answer a customer 's question . Cotumanama " Toby " Pea  --  many employees adopt nicknames to further the cause of simplification  --  learned English words such as " safe " and " out " by watching baseball in his native Dominican Republic and picked up the alphabet from Sesame Street . " The English I speak is broken , " says Pea , a cook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things down . " ( Nonetheless , he often finds himself translating for one of his fellow cooks who is among the 40 percent of employees who do n't speak English . ) <p> When it comes to company material that is typically communicated with words  --  training manuals , say  --  Lloyd sticks mainly to visual tools , an outgrowth of the knack he had to develop for using gestures to make himself understood . To learn how to stack a cooler , for instance , employees study photos of how the contents can be arranged so that drivers do n't have to reach deep inside to grab any drinks . How does City Fresh pack bread ? Employees take turns using a machine that pumps air into a bag , slipping a loaf inside the bag , and then using another machine to tape it up . " A demonstration is better than words , " says Lloyd . <p> City Fresh also counts on numbers to serve as a universal language . For instance , Lloyd worked with his managers to design a checklist that employees use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced  --  the company ships out 4,000 daily , mostly to institutional customers ranging from charter schools to nursing homes  --  and for which accounts . The bulk packers can tell how many pounds of green beans they 'll need . The expediters who match the beverages and desserts to each meal know what time it has to leave and who will be delivering it . Everybody can use the document , no matter what language they speak , says Lloyd . <p> But anybody with designs on rising into a management position has to master English . City Fresh will contribute up to $1,000 per person a year to help ; it allocates $12,000 a year for education . These days , one assistant manager is getting 90 minutes of private tutoring a week . Rather than hauling everyone into a classroom , " we 're going to start using this kind of learning more strategically , " Lloyd says . " It will be a reward for the people who we think will get the most value from it . " Otherwise , he says , ESL classes come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets sufficiently immersed in English at work because " they do n't need to know it , " he says . " They can talk to each other in whatever language they want . " <p> Lloyd goes to such lengths not just to ease communication but also because it 's good for his customers . Many , especially the elderly , are from ethnic communities themselves and have " a taste for the authentic , " as he puts it . Chefs from the Caribbean know how to whip up such specialties as mondongo ( cow intestine ) , stewed goat , and salted codfish . And if employees sometimes run into problems with customers because they do not speak English , they 've also been known to save the day when an English-speaking staffer encounters a customer from another country . <p> Still , there are limits to how open-minded folks can be . Want to put their tolerance to the ultimate test ? Sneak into the production facility and switch the radio to a country music station . " We do not play that stuff around here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could refrigerate the company 's entire inventory of condiments . " Nobody likes that music . " As a result , he says , " we 've agreed to ban the stuff and that seems to work for everybody . We found the simplest way to handle the situation .
