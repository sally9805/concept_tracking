UNCLE TUNGSTEN // Many of my childhood memories are of metals : these seemed to exert a power on me from the start . They stood out , conspicuous against the heterogeneousness of the world , by their shining , gleaming quality , their silveriness , their smoothness and weight . They seemed cool to the touch , and they rang when they were struck . // I loved the yellowness , the heaviness , of gold . My mother would take the wedding ring from her finger and let me handle it for a while , as she told me of its inviolacy , how it never tarnished . " Feel how heavy it is , " she would add . " It 's even heavier than lead . " I knew what lead was , for I had handled the heavy , soft piping the plumber had left one year . Gold was soft , too , my mother told me , so it was usually combined with another metal to make it harder . // It was the same with copper  --  people mixed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very word was like a trumpet to me , for battle was the brave clash of bronze upon bronze , bronze spears on bronze shields , the great shield of Achilles . Or you could alloy copper with zinc , my mother said , to produce brass . All of us  --  my mother , my brothers , and I  --  had our own brass menorahs for Hanukkah . ( My father had a silver one. ) // I knew copper , the shiny rose color of the great copper cauldron in our kitchen  --  it was taken down only once a year , when the quinces and crab apples were ripe in the garden and my mother would stew them to make jelly . // I knew zinc : the dull , slightly bluish birdbath in the garden was made of zinc ; and tin , from the heavy tinfoil in which sandwiches were wrapped for a picnic . My mother showed me that when tin or zinc was bent it uttered a special " cry . " " It 's due to deformation of the crystal structure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not understand her  --  and yet her words fascinated me , made me want to know more . // There was an enormous cast-iron lawn roller out in the garden  --  it weighed five hundred pounds , my father said . We , as children , could hardly budge it , but he was immensely strong and could lift it off the ground . It was always slightly rusty , and this bothered me , for the rust flaked off , leaving little cavities and scabs , and I was afraid the whole roller might corrode and fall apart one day , reduced to a mass of red dust and flakes . I needed to think of metals as stable , like gold  --  able to stave off the losses and ravages of time . // I would sometimes beg my mother to take out her engagement ring and show me the diamond in it . It flashed like nothing I had ever seen , almost as if it gave out more light than it took in . She would show me how easily it scratched glass , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strangely , startlingly cold ; metals felt cool to the touch , but the diamond was icy . That was because it conducted heat so well , she said  --  better than any metal  --  so it drew the body heat away from one 's lips when they touched it . This was a feeling I was never to forget . Another time , she showed me how if one touched a diamond to a cube of ice , it would draw heat from one 's hand into the ice and cut straight through it as if it were butter . My mother told me that diamond was a special form of carbon , like the coal we used in every room in winter . I was puzzled by this  --  how could black , flaky , opaque coal be the same as the hard , transparent gemstone in her ring ? // I loved light , especially the lighting of the Shabbas candles on Friday nights , when my mother would murmur a prayer as she lit them . I was not allowed to touch them once they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their flames were holy , not to be fiddled with . I was mesmerized by the little cone of blue flame at the candle 's center  --  why was it blue ? Our house had coal fires , and I would often gaze into the heart of a fire , watching it go from a dim red glow to orange , to yellow , and then I would blow on it with the bellows until it glowed almost white-hot . If it got hot enough , I wondered , would it blaze blue , be blue-hot ? // Did the sun and stars burn in the same way ? Why did they never go out ? What were they made of ? I was reassured when I learned that the core of the earth consisted of a great ball of iron  --  this sounded solid , something one could depend on . And I was pleased when I was told that we ourselves were made of the very same elements as composed the sun and stars , that some of my atoms might once have been in a distant star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my atoms were only on loan and might fly apart at any time , fly away like the fine talcum powder I saw in the bathroom . // I badgered my parents constantly with questions . Where did color come from ? Why did my mother use the platinum loop that hung above the stove to cause the gas burner to catch fire ? What happened to the sugar when one stirred it into the tea ? Where did it go ? Why did water bubble when it boiled ? ( I liked to watch water set to boil on the stove , to see it quivering with heat before it burst into bubbles. ) // My mother showed me other wonders . She had a necklace of polished yellow pieces of amber , and she showed me how , when she rubbed them , tiny pieces of paper would fly up and stick to them . Or she would put the electrified amber against my ear , and I would hear and feel a tiny snap , a spark . // My two older brothers Marcus and David , nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnets and enjoyed demonstrating these to me , drawing the magnet beneath a piece of paper on which were strewn powdery iron filings . I never tired of the remarkable patterns that rayed out from the poles of the magnet . " Those are lines of force , " Marcus explained to me  --  but I was none the wiser . // Then there was the crystal radio my brother Michael gave me , which I played with in bed , jiggling the wire on the crystal until I got a station loud and clear . And the luminous clocks  --  the house was full of them , because my uncle Abe had been a pioneer in the development of luminous paints . These , too , like my crystal radio , I would take under the bedclothes at night , into my private , secret vault , and they would light up my cavern of sheets with an eerie , greenish light . // All these things  --  the rubbed amber , the magnets , the crystal radio , the clock dials with their tireless coruscations  --  gave me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the familiar , visible world of colors and appearances there lay a dark , hidden world of mysterious laws and phenomena . // Whenever we had " a fuse , " my father would climb up to the porcelain fusebox high on the kitchen wall , identify the fused fuse , now reduced to a melted blob , and replace it with a new fuse of an odd , soft wire . It was difficult to imagine that a metal could melt  --  could a fuse really be made from the same material as a lawn roller or a tin can ? // The fuses were made of a special alloy , my father told me , a combination of tin and lead and other metals . All of these had relatively low melting points , but the melting point of their alloy was lower still . How could this be so , I wondered ? What was the secret of this new metal 's strangely low melting point ? // For that matter , what was electricity , and how did it flow ? Was it a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did it flow through the metal but not the porcelain ? This , too , called for explanation . // My questions were endless , and touched on everything , though they tended to circle around , again and again , to my obsession , the metals . Why were they shiny ? Why smooth ? Why cool ? Why hard ? Why heavy ? Why did they bend , not break ? Why did they ring ? Why could two soft metals like zinc and copper , or tin and copper , combine to produce a harder metal ? What gave gold its goldness , and why did it never tarnish ? My mother was patient , for the most part , and tried to explain , but eventually , when I exhausted her patience , she would say , " That 's all I can tell you  --  you 'll have to quiz Uncle Dave to learn more . " // We had called him Uncle Tungsten for as long as I could remember , because he manufactured lightbulbs with filaments of fine tungsten wire . His firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old factory in Farringdon and watched him at work , in a wing collar , with his shirtsleeves rolled up . The heavy , dark tungsten powder would be pressed , hammered , sintered at red heat , then drawn into finer and finer wire for the filaments . Uncle 's hands were seamed with the black powder , beyond the power of any washing to get out ( he would have to have the whole thickness of epidermis removed , and even this , one suspected , would not have been enough ) . After thirty years of working with tungsten , I imagined , the heavy element was in his lungs and bones , in every vessel and viscus , every tissue of his body . I thought of this as a wonder , not a curse  --  his body invigorated and fortified by the mighty element , given a strength and enduringness almost more than human . // Whenever I visited the factory , he would take me around the machines , or have his foreman do so . ( The foreman was a short , muscular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testament to the benefits of working with tungsten . ) I never tired of the ingenious machines , always beautifully clean and sleek and oiled , or the furnace where the black powder was compacted from a powdery incoherence into dense , hard bars with a grey sheen . // During my visits to the factory , and sometimes at home , Uncle Dave would teach me about metals with little experiments . I knew that mercury , that strange liquid metal , was incredibly heavy and dense . Even lead floated on it , as my uncle showed me by floating a lead bullet in a bowl of quicksilver . But then he pulled out a small grey bar from his pocket , and to my amazement , this sank immediately to the bottom . That , he said , was his metal , tungsten . // Uncle loved the density of the tungsten he made , and its refractoriness , its great chemical stability . He loved to handle it  --  the wire , the powder , but the massy little bars and ingots most of all . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ) in his hands . " Feel it , Oliver , " he would say , thrusting a bar at me . " Nothing in the world feels like sintered tungsten . " He would tap the little bars and they would emit a deep clink . " The sound of tungsten , " Uncle Dave would say , " nothing like it . " I did not know whether this was true , but I never questioned it . // As the youngest of almost the youngest ( I was the last of four , and my mother the sixteenth of eighteen ) , I was born almost a hundred years after my maternal grandfather and never knew him . He was born Mordechai Fredkin , in 1837 , in a small village in Russia . As a youth he managed to avoid being impressed into the Cossack army and fled Russia using the passport of a dead man named Landau ; he was just sixteen . As Marcus Landau , he made his way to Paris and then Frankfurt , where he married ( his wife was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now with the first of their children , they moved to England . // My mother 's father was , by all accounts , a man drawn equally to the spiritual and the physical . He was by profession a boot and shoe manufacturer , a shochet ( a kosher slaughterer ) , and later a grocer  --  but he was also a Hebrew scholar , a mystic , an amateur mathematician , and an inventor . He had a wide-ranging mind : he published a newspaper , the Jewish Standard , in his basement , from 1888 to 1891 ; he was interested in the new science of aeronautics and corresponded with the Wright brothers , who paid him a visit when they came to London in the early 1900s ( some of my uncles could still remember this ) . He had a passion , my aunts and uncles told me , for intricate arithmetical calculations , which he would do in his head while lying in the bath . But he was drawn above all to the invention of lamps  --  safety lamps for mines , carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1870s. // A polymath and autodidact himself , Grandfather was passionately keen on education  --  and , most especially , a scientific education  --  for all his children , for his nine daughters no less than his nine sons . Whether it was this or the sharing of his own passionate enthusiasms , seven of his sons were eventually drawn to mathematics and the physical sciences , as he was . His daughters , by contrast , were by and large drawn to the human sciences  --  to biology , to medicine , to education and sociology . Two of them founded schools . Two others were teachers . My mother was at first torn between the physical and the human sciences : she was particularly attracted to chemistry as a girl ( her older brother Mick had just begun a career as a chemist ) , but later became an anatomist and surgeon . She never lost her love of , her feeling for , the physical sciences , nor the desire to go beneath the surfaces of things , to explain . Thus the thousand and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient or peremptory answers , but careful ones which enthralled me ( though they were often above my head ) . I was encouraged from the start to interrogate , to investigate . // Given all my aunts and uncles ( and a couple more on my father 's side ) , my cousins numbered almost a hundred ; and since the family , for the most part , was centered in London ( though there were far-flung American , Continental , and South African branches ) , we would all meet frequently , tribally , on family occasions . This sense of extended family was one I knew and enjoyed as far back as memory goes , and it went with a sense that it was our business , the family business , to ask questions , to be " scientific , " just as we were Jewish or English . I was among the youngest of the cousins  --  I had cousins in South Africa who were forty-five years my senior  --  and some of these cousins were already practicing scientists or mathematicians ; others , only a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One cousin was a young physics teacher ; three were reading chemistry at university ; and one , a precocious fifteen-year-old , was showing great mathematical promise . All of us , I could not help imagining , had a bit of the old man in us. //
