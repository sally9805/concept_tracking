What 's worse  --  being diagnosed with cancer or discovering that your health insurance wo n't go the distance in covering your treatment ? These days , with earlier detection and better therapies , cancer is n't the death sentence it once often was . But treating it is expensive , and employers and health plans are increasingly placing caps on the maximum benefits they will pay , as well as other restrictions on coverage that hit cancer patients particularly hard . If the tumor does n't kill you , it seems , the medical bills just might . The policy limits on coverage typically apply to all illnesses , not just cancer . But experts say that cancer patients are particularly likely to bump into annual caps on doctor visits or drugs , say , because the disease often requires intensive treatments  --  including surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation  --  in the months after diagnosis . Even if patients avoid the initial pitfall , they may eventually run afoul of lifetime benefit caps . " Every year the caps are getting lower , and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation CEO and founder . " Now insurers are capping their exposure on a range of goods and services . " It 's not unusual to see lifetime benefit limits of $1 million or $2 million on health coverage ; about half of employer-sponsored health plans have them , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation . But patient advocates say they 're now seeing lifetime limits of just $50,000 or $100,000 in some cases . More patients are encountering other limits for certain products and services , too . Plans may cover only a certain dollar amount for outpatient services , for example , or limit coverage to a dozen radiation sessions . And many plans , while not technically capping drug coverage , place cancer drugs in higher formulary " tiers " that require patients to pay a percentage of the total cost rather than a straight copayment . Faced with the possibility of financially crippling bills for these drugs , which can cost several thousand dollars a month , some patients go without . Many could face the dilemma . One in three women and half of all men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Cancer Society . Compared with other common diseases , it 's expensive to treat . Total spending per year for cancer patients averaged $5,727 in 2004 , according to data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality . Spending for heart disease , by contrast , was $4,506 and diabetes , $1,904 . Noting that a round of chemotherapy can easily cost $5,000 , Karen Pollitz , a project director at Georgetown University 's Health Policy Institute , says , " If you have cancer and your policy has limits on services , you 'll hit them going 85 miles an hour and blow right by them . " No choice . That 's what happened to Dora McGiverin . Diagnosed with breast cancer last October , the 45-year-old single mother had four months of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before undergoing a mastectomy . An additional three months of chemo and six weeks of radiation therapy followed surgery . Now , she takes the cancer drug Herceptin . Just a month into chemotherapy , McGiverin started receiving bills from her providers . That 's when she discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which include chemotherapy , radiation , and doctor visits . Although she 's feeling fine now , she has nearly $98,000 in outstanding medical bills and no way to pay them on her $27,000 salary as a billing manager for a home health agency in Bridgeport , Ohio . " The only thing I can do is wait until treatment is done and then file for bankruptcy , " she says . McGiverin 's situation is hardly unique . In a survey published last year in Northwestern University Law Review , researchers found that 46 percent of bankruptcy filers cited a medical reason for their insolvency . Meanwhile , a study of cancer patients conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation , the Harvard School of Public Health , and USA Today found that 1 in 4 families affected by cancer used up all or most of their savings coping with the disease . The lack of access to adequate , affordable health insurance is such a significant problem that the American Cancer Society is devoting its entire $15 million advertising budget this year to the issue . The ACS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Insurance Assistance Service , operated in conjunction with Georgetown 's Health Policy Institute . Its insurance specialists have helped more than 11,500 cancer patients in the 28 states it serves get information and assistance with their health coverage problems . But more often than not , the options are either inadequate or unaffordable , according to the service 's own tally . That does n't mean you 're helpless . If you have a choice of health plans , scrutinize your options as the annual fall enrollment period approaches . " Look at insurance through the cancer lens , " says Christy Schmidt , ACS 's senior director of policy . Ask yourself , " What would happen if I was diagnosed with cancer and I had this health plan ? " CANCER INSURANCE A specialized cancer policy can supplement a regular plan but should never replace it , experts say . A good cancer insurance policy will cover :  --  All cancer diagnoses , with no exclusions for particular cancers or precancerous conditions .  --  Hospitalization , outpatient care , surgery , doctor visits , drugs , radiation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PET scans is a plus .  --  Side effects of treatment , such as pneumonia . ( This is not standard. )  --  Travel expenses . Finally , make sure your regular plan will cover you if you have separate cancer insurance . Some wo n't .
