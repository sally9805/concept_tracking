Chapter One First time I saw her was in the mirror on my locker door . I 'd kicked my swim gear onto the bottom shelf and was reaching to the top for my calc book when she opened her locker across the hall . She had a streaked blond ponytail dangling out the back of her baseball cap . Great . Now I was obligated to rag on her for violating the new dress code . Forget it , I decided . My vote - the only dissenting one in the whole student council - still counted . With me , anyway . People could come to school buck naked for all I cared . It was n't about clothes . We slammed our lockers in unison and turned . Her eyes met mine . " Hi , " she said , smiling . My stomach fluttered . " Hi , " I answered automatically . She was new . Had to be . I would 've noticed her . She sauntered away , but not before I caught a glimpse of her T-shirt . It said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her shoulder , the way you do when you know someone 's watching . That 's when it registered - the rainbow triangle below the message . My eyes dropped . Kept her in sight , though , as she disappeared around the corner . I shifted my attention to my schedule . Brit Lit , calc , U.S. History , then art and econ after lunch . Was I out of my mind ? Why was I taking a full load my last semester of high school ? Were n't we supposed to revel in this time , embrace our friends , screw around until graduation ? At some pivotal point , of course , we 'd decide the direction our lives were going to take . A derisive laugh might 've escaped my lips . Like I got to decide anything about my life . I headed down the deserted hallway , clutching my books to my chest . This is insane , I thought . I do n't even need the credits . I 'd gotten to choose the early track - first class at seven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last minute so I 'd be finishing the day with everyone else . I drew a deep breath - and coughed . Who needed to get stoned before school when you got a free ride from the carpet-cleaning fumes ? Morning was a blur . As I stumbled to lunch , my head reeling from the volume of homework I 'd already accumulated , my anxiety mounted . I 'd be up till midnight , easy . " Babe ! " Seth called across the crowded cafeteria . He loped to the double doorway to meet me . Kiss me . " We 're over here . " He thumbed toward the vending machines , snaking an arm around my waist and steering me along . " Hi , Holland . Hey , Seth , " a few people greeted us as we weaved between tables . I assumed my oh-so-happy face . Plaster-casted smile . What was wrong with me ? I loved school . I could n't wait to get back after winter break . " Holland , did you see Mrs. Lucas ? She was looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her for me to sit . " She said to tell you to drop into the career center sometime today . " Today , tomorrow , never . Popping the top on a can of Pepsi Twist that Seth had set in front of me , I said to Kirsten across the table , " How was Christmas in Texas ? " Leah kicked my shin . Uh-oh . Kirsten sighed theatrically . " You had to ask . " She launched into a psychodrama about how her mother was a raving lunatic the whole two weeks and all they did was scream at each other . Seth split his fries with me and I zoned . He said in my ear , " You want ketchup ? " I must 've nodded because he got up and left . Leah and Kirsten began to talk about college - again . Could we get through one whole day without bringing up the subject ? Kirsten said , " Mom wants me to commute to Metro Urban and live at home . Like that 's going to happen . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is graduate and get the hell out of this rat hole . " I checked out again . At some point Seth returned with the ketchup and I swabbed a greasy fry through the watery blob . Round and round it goes ; where it stops , nobody knows . Seth nudged me . " You okay ? " I glanced up to find everyone staring at me . Was I chanting out loud ? Relinquishing my hold on the mutilated fry , I crossed my eyes and said , " I got Arbuthnot for Brit Lit . " They all went , " Eeooh . " Leah added , " Do n't ever be late . She 'll ream you out in front of everyone . " I grimaced . I hated when teachers did that . " You know , " I said , picking up my cheeseburger , " all these anti-bullying policies should apply to teachers . I mean , corporal punishment is illegal . " I chomped into my burger and chewed . " Public humiliation , " I said with my mouth full , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbing heads , I assumed they all agreed . What were we going to do about it ? Nothing . Even though I was president of student council , I felt powerless to effect change of any social significance at our school . I take that back . We now had a pop machine in the hall . Drawing Level I was , as Seth referred to it , a bullshit class . But I needed to fill time between lunch and econ . As I wandered down the arts wing , feeling totally out of my element , I wondered what mental aberration had possessed me when I chose an art elective . Drawing , no less , which probably required talent . More than doodling in notebooks . The assigned studio , 212A , had four rows of tables set end-to-end with chairs arranged haphazardly . No semblance of order . I slid into a plasti-seat in the back . My uneasiness grew as I studied the crowd clogging the doorway and milling around the display cases . Not the kind of people I usually associated with - which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity . It was just ... I do n't know . I felt weird . I decided to drop the class . Maybe add another study hall . I was going to need it . A man 's voice in the hallway herded everyone inside . As people filed across the threshold , I caught sight of her . The baseball cap was gone ; now her hair flowed around her shoulders . Her eyes darted across the studio and stopped on me . I wanted to look away , but could n't . She held me somehow , spellbound . The instructor bustled in and broke the connection . Oh , God . He looked like Einstein on ecstasy . " Just find a seat anywhere , " he said to the stragglers . As he turned to write his name on the board , I flipped open a spiral . When I glanced over surreptitiously , she 'd slipped into a seat up front . Another girl slid in beside her . I knew that girl - Randi or Brandi . She was on swim team last year for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked up . Brandi . " I realize you ca n't read this , " the instructor said as he ran a palm over his cotton candy hair , but it says Jonathan McElwain . ' " He was right . His handwriting was gorgeous , all loopy and bold , but you 'd need clearer vision than mine to decipher it . I squinted through my contacts - that was an M ? He brushed chalk off his hands and added , " You can call me Mackel . " I wrote down , Mr. McElwain . Then drew a line through it and printed , Mackel . " If I want to get paid , I have to turn this in . " He flapped a computer printout at us . Hopping onto the desk , he curled cross-legged and uncapped a Flair . " Anderson , Michaela . " " Present . " A girl at the end of my row raised her hand , and Mackel scratched a checkmark . A few people I did actually know . It 's inevitable when you 've lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious orange spikes and nostril ring was in my calc class . Winslow Demming . I remembered him from computer science sophomore year , except back then Winslow was a geek . Brilliant , though . And sweet . Another reminder why people should n't be judged on appearance . Mr. McElwain - Mackel - progressed through the list . For some reason I was focusing on the back of the blond girl 's head , only half listening for my name . " Cecelia Goddard , " Mackel read . Her hand shot up and she said , " It 's Cece . " I wrote it down . Cecelia Goddard . CC ? Cece ? Cece , I decided and drew a box around it . " Holland Jaeger . " A couple of heads swiveled . " What ? " I blinked up . " Holland Jaeger ? " " Oh , here . " I raised my hand . Added in a mutter , " Apparently not all here . " She twisted around and smiled . My stomach lurched . I shielded my face with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supplies list . It was long . There were pencils , ink , charcoal , erasers , markers , pens , two sizes of drawing tablets . God , I 'd have to work a month of overtime to afford all this stuff . Mackel said , " I know it 's a short week , but I 'd appreciate it if you could get your supplies in the next couple of days . Go to Hobby Lobby or Wal-Mart for the best prices . If anyone has real financial need , come see me after class . That does n't mean you 'd rather spend your money on a kegger . " He eagle-eyed the room . " But I have a starving artist fund , so do n't be shy . " I liked that . He was understanding . Maybe I 'd wait to drop . At two-fifteen the bell rang and I gathered my books and notes from econ , feeling totally brain-dead . Lockers banged open and closed as I trudged down the hall . " Hi , Holland . Have a good break ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waved , plastering on The Smile . Get me out of here , I thought . Static crackled in my head like a radio stuck between stations . The halls began to clear and my locker materialized - finally . As I twisted the combination lock , I heard across the way , " So , you just transferred ? Where 'd you go before here ? " I opened the door and captured Brandi and Cece in my mirror . Cece said , " Washington Central . " Brandi said , " Oh , yeah ? Do you know Joanie ? She 's one of us . Joanie Fowler . " " Does n't sound familiar . " " You have to know her . " " I said I do n't . " The sharpness of Cece 's voice made me turn around . Brandi caught my eye and I turned back . In my mirror I watched as Cece shoved a book into her backpack and removed a fleece vest off the hook . She let out a long breath and said , " Sorry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I can imagine . " Brandi smiled knowingly . I wondered what she knew . Brandi held the backpack while Cece put on her vest . Their conversation muted as a herd of people stampeded past . I caught the tail end of Brandi 's " ... go for a Coke or something ? " " I ca n't , " Cece said . " I have to work . " She retrieved the pack from Brandi and slung it over her shoulder . I realized I was eavesdropping shamelessly and squatted to unzip my swimming duffel . " How come you transferred ? " Brandi asked . " Health reasons . " Cece slammed her locker . " My car would n't start this morning and I do n't really want to wait here for my brother to pick me up . Do you think you could give me a ride to work ? " " Sure , " Brandi chirped . " No problem . " They headed out together . Brandi had said , " One of us . " Did that mean she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any gays in our school . Until now . I loaded up my backpack and grabbed my duffel , thinking , I guess it pays to advertise . ( Continues ... )
