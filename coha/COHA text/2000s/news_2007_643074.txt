<p> For years , Johnny Five lived not on the streets but below them , in the dark underworld beneath an abandoned train station in the Bronx . <p> He had to crawl in the dirt at the edge of a concrete platform to get in and out . He bathed with rubbing alcohol , but still his skin was covered with insect bites and infections . He said God talked to him there , sometimes through a portable radio , yet he considered his cave a kind of hell : overheated in the summer , frigid in the winter , a sunless place hard on the body but worse on the soul . <p> It was Christmas Eve when he first heard the news : Someone was offering him a way out . After reading an article about Johnny in The New York Times , Peter D. Beitchman , the executive director of the Bridge Inc. , a nonprofit group that provides housing and services to mentally ill homeless people and others , immediately arranged for him to move into an apartment . <p> Days later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Sister Lauria Fitzgerald , a Roman Catholic nun who helps the homeless in the Bronx . They ate dinner with another nun at an Italian restaurant in the Arthur Avenue section , three miles from the cave and around the corner from Johnny 's new home . He feasted on a plate of eggplant parmigiana and enjoyed his first taste of tiramisu . <p> But he did n't want to touch the white linen napkin on the table . It was too clean . <p> " I thought I was n't worthy to use it , " said Johnny , 45 , who said he suffers from schizophrenia and whose real name is John Carbonell . " I used the one that was in the basket where the bread was . " <p> For the next several months , Johnny would drift between his old life underground and his new one above it , struggling the way a man freed from prison must readjust to society . It is easy in a sense to take the city 's homeless people off the streets , but it is harder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . <p> Even after Johnny moved into the apartment the first week of January , he returned to the wooded area around the cave to feed Meow Meow and the other stray cats he had named . His first several days in the apartment  --  a light-drenched one-bedroom unit with hardwood floors and a large kitchen in a five-story building  --  he did not bother locking the door . " There 's no doors in the cave , " he explained . <p> He had bold ambitions of starting over : He talked about getting a sewing machine , so he could design clothes , and he refused to move his belongings from the cave to the apartment because he worried about bringing in bugs . He wanted to put up " No Smoking " signs , vowing not to indulge his old addictions in his new environment . Johnny , an ex-convict who served time in the early 1990s for a drug-related offense , has been smoking cocaine since he was a teenager . <p> One Sunday in January , Johnny slept on the bed , on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots . He resembled not the sole occupant of Apartment 3B , but a visitor . He said he spent the night in the apartment , then went back to the cave at 6 a.m. , then returned later that morning to the apartment . The flashlight he used in the cave still shone inside his jacket pocket . <p> He woke up and sat outside on the back fire escape , smoking a cigarette . Behind him , he could hear the water running in the bathtub , his bathtub . On the streets , he used to wash up at an open fire hydrant . <p> Johnny survives on a monthly check from the federal Supplemental Security Income program . As part of his arrangement with the Bridge , the nonprofit group that provided the apartment , his rent would be $168 a month , about 30 percent of his government check . Sister Lauria and two case managers , one from the Bridge and one from the Visiting Nurse Service of New York , planned to help him make the transition . <p> The bed and the furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not new to Johnny . In the cave , he had created a makeshift home : Sleeping on a quilt-covered mattress atop milk crates , keeping a bottle of cologne near the bed , cooking with cans of Sterno , using a car battery to power a DVD player . He was not awed by 3B , but somewhat suspicious of it . <p> " Sometimes the one living in that cardboard box is happier than the one living at the penthouse , " he said . <p> Johnny had been living in the cave off and on since 1986 , and for the last nine years or so he had settled in permanently . The abandoned train station sits in a fenced-off area thick with weeds and trash not far from Yankee Stadium . <p> Sister Lauria tried for years to persuade Johnny to get out of the cave , but it was not until last year that he told her he wanted to leave . " I realized I would have been better off doing 10 years in prison than nine years in that cave , crawling in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Johnny 's homelessness was not about a lack of housing . It was more complicated , a result of a variety of spiritual , psychological and emotional causes . " Everything just bothering my conscience , " he said of the reasons he was homeless . " How can I ask God for forgiveness when I do n't forgive myself ? So I 'll torture myself and go to the cave . " <p> Sister Lauria often coaxed him out of the cave with the promise of odd jobs and a good laugh . He became one of her regular assistants , accompanying her on holidays to feed the homeless . Last year , a deliveryman who works in the neighborhood needed a place to stay , so Johnny gave him his room in the cave and moved to the opposite wall . <p> " I try to imitate her , " Johnny said of Sister Lauria , a member of the Sisters of St. Dominic of Blauvelt , N.Y . " She imitates Christ . I try to imitate her . " <p> She was thrilled for Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I was a mother sending my son away to college , " said Sister Lauria , who helps the homeless as an outreach worker for the Highbridge Community Life Center and as a manager of a thrift shop run by Siena House , a women 's shelter . <p> But she was worried about how he would cope . She had seen other homeless people struggle to adapt to life indoors . <p> Johnny struggled , too . Weeks after moving in , he kept returning to the cave . He missed his cats , whom he called his soldiers . He missed his old neighborhood around Ogden Avenue . He went back out of concern for his former roommate , the deliveryman , and he went back to feed his addictions . He hates and loves his crack cocaine habit , just as he hates and loves his cave . " When you pick up drugs , " he said , " you 're saying goodbye to all your dreams , all your goals and all you can be . " <p> He figured he stayed in the cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , he had taken the doors off a closet and used them as partitions to create a small darkened hideout , like a room in the cave . By April , Sister Lauria had not seen him for about two weeks , so she paid him a visit . She found he had put up plastic tablecloths and plastic bags all over the apartment , on the walls and on the ceiling . He told her he thought his neighbors were spying on him . <p> He took down the plastic , but moved out soon after . He lived there for four months , from early January to late April . <p> He said he had become uncomfortable there . " Even though I had paid the rent , I never really slept there , " he said . " There was no life in the apartment . I will compare it to a spring break , with all the utilities and this and that and whatever . But no , it 's not for me . " <p> The Bridge had offered him another apartment and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those appointments . " We hope that Johnny will come back , " said Mr. Beitchman , the executive director of the Bridge . " We do hope . Our experience in all these years is that folks are at different points of readiness at different times . " <p> Johnny returned to Ogden Avenue and began running errands again for Sister Lauria . She helped get him a job at a substance abuse treatment program . Johnny did janitorial work for several days . Then he quit . He was overpaid by mistake , and he returned the money because he felt it was the right thing to do . <p> In the end , he left the apartment for reasons that made sense only to him . Because of his paranoia and schizophrenia , because of crack , because he felt isolated from those who knew him best , because of the cats , because the bathroom was too small , because he did n't want to live there without a spouse . <p> Some in his old neighborhood were upset with Johnny , but Sister Lauria told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again with life on the streets , she was ready to help him find another apartment . <p> " Even though housing seemed like a baby step in light of everything else going on in his life , it was too much of a big step , " she said . <p> Johnny said he was now sleeping in a plywood hut he had built near the cave . He was a jumble of emotions , a paradox of hope and despair . He said he worried that he might be infected with H.I.V. He said that he had never been happier and that the best thing God ever made was tomorrow . <p> One recent afternoon , Johnny was back in the cave . Candles lighted a back room in a far corner , at the end of a maze of garbage bags and concrete walls . He talked about fixing it up again . He smoked some crack through a thin glass tube the size of a cigarette . Then he crawled out , worried about Sister Lauria . <p> His life swayed in this way , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said he was ready to work with the Bridge again and to give an apartment another try . He had thrown the tube that he uses as a crack pipe against a wall in the cave . It had been nearly two days since he last got high . " I had to tell Satan , ' You do n't own me , ' " he said . <p> He went to a store across the street from the thrift shop . He bought a bottle of nonalcoholic sparkling apple cider , to celebrate . <p> #
