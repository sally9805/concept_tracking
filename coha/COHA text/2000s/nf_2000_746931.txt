Section : For Males Only <p> There are millions of these six-legged bachelors in sunshine states like California and Florida . Because they 're small and unobtrusive , you 're unlikely to ever notice them . But their success in the game of love helps protect your favorite fruits and vegetables from becoming an icky , maggoty mess . <p> What are they ? <p> Temperature-sensitive lethal Mediterranean fruit flies  --  or TSLs for short . Through a bit of laboratory trickery , TSL medflies that work outdoors are exclusively males . All of them are sterile  --  that is , infertile . Dropped from airplanes to work in areas where invading medflies have been detected , the TSL medflies have an important assignment : Find and mate with wild female Mediterranean fruit flies . <p> These fertile females would like to make a home for their offspring in warm-weather states . When they mate with sterile male medflies , however , no viable offspring are produced . Deprived of new generations of healthy young flies , the population soon crashes . <p> Now , 6 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantations of southwestern Guatemala have shown that what 's known as the Toliman strain of TSLs do their job anywhere from three to five times better than conventional , mixed-sex strains . <p> Temperature-sensitive lethal medflies get their name from the fact that high temperatures can be lethal to eggs containing TSL females . This genetic quirk in females was discovered by researchers working with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna , Austria , about a decade ago . <p> The TSL trait allows mass-rearing of medflies that are exclusively males . And on a per-male basis , TSL males do n't cost any more to rear than standard , mixed-sex strains of medflies . That saves resources that would otherwise go into producing the unneeded females . What 's more , not having sterile females to distract them once they are outdoors and looking for wild , fertile females may be a key to the TSL males ' success . <p> To produce TSL males requires insectary workers to bathe the white , banana-shaped medfly eggs in 97 Fahrenheit water for 12 to 24 hours . That kills all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those with males . Later , when they are pupae  --  their final developmental stage before becoming adult flies  --  the insects are irradiated for several minutes to render them sexually sterile . <p> Using temperature-sensitive lethal medflies , says ARS research geneticist Donald O. McInnis , is an effective , environmentally friendly strategy that helps reduce the need for chemical insecticides such as malathion . Medfly , Ceratitis capitata , is one of the world 's worst insect pests of agriculture . It can infest more than 250 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and easily cost millions of dollars to eradicate . If it were to become established in California , for example , this industrious , one-third-inch-long insect could make a dent of anywhere from $324 to $510 million in the state 's economy every year . <p> Medflies ruin crops when fertile females use their tubelike ovipositors to punch holes in the skin of a ripening fruit or vegetable , then pump their eggs inside . The eggs hatch and produce wiggly medfly larvae that develop inside the fruit , feeding on the flesh and making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground to continue their development into adult flies that begin the cycle all over again . <p> McInnis , who is at ARS ' U.S. Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center in Honolulu , Hawaii , helped design the pioneering tests of the Toliman TSL medflies in Guatemala . He did the work with David Lance of USDA 's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service , formerly at Waimanalo , Hawaii , and now at Cape Cod , Massachusetts ; Pedro Rendon and colleagues with APHIS in Guatemala City , Guatemala ; and co-researchers from the government of Guatemala . <p> Rendon and staffers at the International Atomic Energy Agency developed the Toliman TSL strain by crossing the Viennese TSL flies with a Guatemalan strain of medfly . Toliman TSLs needed for the collaborative research were produced at a medfly factory in El Pino , outside Guatemala City , Guatemala . APHIS and the Guatemalan government run that insectary . <p> Native to Africa , medflies have lived in Guatemala since at least the 1960s . The El Pino factory can produce up to about 50 billion medflies a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that helps stop the species from advancing north into the United States . Other steriles are shipped to the United States for use in regional wars against medfly . <p> California , for instance , has an enormous need for steriles for its ongoing campaign in Los Angeles , Riverside , Orange , and San Bernardino counties . <p> The state last year used 15 billion steriles for this war on medflies . Florida has a similar campaign and uses 70 million sterile medflies a week in a 500-square-mile area . <p> The Guatemalan studies , begun in 1993 , included the largest-ever outdoor test of TSL medflies . For these rigorous examinations of the insects ' proficiencies , more than 120 million Toliman TSLs and the lab 's conventional " Petapa " strain of neutered medflies were set free in coffee fields . <p> As part of the experiment , researchers collected coffee berries that had been visited by the female flies to determine whether the hidden eggs were infertile . In plots where the Toliman TSLs had been released , the proportion of infertile eggs to fertile eggs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard lab-reared strain . <p> The Toliman TSLs also scored high in two other critical categories : field dispersal , or ability to roam throughout fields instead of staying in one place , and field survival , or ability to adapt to climate and other environmental conditions . <p> The ARS , APHIS , and Guatemalan investigators were the first to move TSLs out of the lab and into mass production . As a result of the team 's exhaustive studies of Toliman TSLs , the El Pino fly factory is now planning to produce only this top-performing strain . <p> Two major sterile-medfly factories in Hawaii  --  one operated by APHIS and the other by the State of California  --  also plan to produce TSLs exclusively . In all , they could provide more than 400 million steriles a week for mainland campaigns . <p> Largely because of the impressive results of the Guatemalan field tests with Toliman TSLs , other countries threatened by medfly invasions are opting to use TSLs in their own mass-rearing programs . Chile and the Portuguese island of Madeira , for example , are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ravages of wild medflies . <p> This research is part of Crop Protection and Quarantine , an ARS National Program ( #304 ) described on the World Wide Web at http : //www.nps.ars.usda.gov /programs/cppvs.htm . <p> Donald O.
