<p> Heidi Anderson has a need for speed . <p> The 34-year-old freelance writer jumps on the Internet up to 50 hours a week for work and play . She does n't even have a TV , but her computer is a one-stop media shop : for news , games , research and to listen to radio broadcasts of her beloved Boston Red Sox over the Internet . <p> Anderson ca n't stand to wait painful minutes for pages to load or graphics to pop up . She puts the pedal to the metal because she has high-speed Internet access through a digital subscriber line , or DSL . Her hot-rod-like phone lines can handle massive amounts of information . <p> ' Once you are used to how fast it can be , I do n't see how you can be satisfied with a regular dial-up connection , ' she said . <p> High-speed Internet is cool . People dig it . But they ca n't always get it . Not yet . <p> A few million Internet surfers and businesses nationwide have found the fast lane with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early adopters are pioneers , because access plans and price ranges are often complex and confusing . In addition , while widely advertised , the services are barely available . <p> Clearly , the race is on among companies that predict all Internet users will graduate to mach speed . AOL 's proposed acquisition of Time Warner , announced two weeks ago , is one indication . AOL needs Time Warner 's high-speed cable lines into 13 million homes so it can offer subscribers the latest Internet video , audio and data services . Otherwise , 20 million dial-up customers could go elsewhere . <p> ' The killer application is high-speed access regardless of the technology , ' said Michael Harris , president of Kinetic Strategies , a technology research firm in Phoenix . ' From the end user 's perspective , it really does n't matter . They just want the service . The service providers that can get there first at the right price are going to be the winners . ' <p> Heidi Anderson pays $ 29.95 a month for one of US West 's several MegaBit service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet service from Denver-based RMI.net and her regular phone service . But she only needs one phone line and can surf the ' Net and talk on the phone at the same time . <p> Consumers have two other primary ways to get high-speed Internet access . <p> Cable modems allow high-speed Internet connections through the same cable wires that pipe in MTV . Fixed-wireless towers relay high-speed Internet signals to antennas on buildings . <p> Each technology is still in its infancy , with less than 2.5 million subscribers in North America today . <p> In technospeak , high-speed access is called ' broadband . ' It creates wider pipes to carry more information . <p> That means more data and snazzier graphics and even video - with less waiting . No matter how fast the computer , clogged plumbing can create a bottleneck . <p> Cable , wireless and DSL promise to transform the Internet . They will let people watch films and broadcasts , conduct two-way video conferences and make phone calls . <p> They can give you speeds up to 100 times faster than dial-up connections - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cable and DSL residential plans cost $ 30 to $ 50 a month for speeds that are four to 14 times faster than dial-up modems . Additional equipment can jack up the initial cost by several hundred dollars , and installation costs can apply . <p> Which is best for you ? Each has limits and drawbacks . <p> In rural areas with fewer customers , DSL may never be an option . Cable networks rarely pass through business districts . Trees , hills and other obstructions can make wireless access impossible . <p> High-speed cable access has a head start . Cable has an estimated 1.8 million Internet subscribers in North America , according to Kinetic Strategies . DSL has nearly 600,000 lines installed in the U.S. , according to the research firm TeleChoice . There are 12,000 fixed-wireless customers , based on research by The Strategis Group in Washington , D.C. <p> In 2003 , cable will have nearly 16 million subscribers , DSL will have 9.6 million , and wireless will grab 2.5 million customers , those firms predict . <p> Broadband pioneering <p> AT &T,; through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest cable operator in the U.S. AT &T; is upgrading its cable network for two-way information flow that is needed for Internet , local telephone and interactive TV . <p> AT &T; is testing fixed-wireless service in Texas , and it also resells DSL to serve customers where it has no cable . <p> High Speed Access Corp. , based in Cherry Creek , offers cable Internet access to about 10,000 rural and suburban customers in 40 states . But it also hooks up customers through wireless and DSL connections . <p> ' They want to be able serve every customer and every need with whatever technology will make this work , ' said Dave Eiswert , a broadband expert at Strategis Group . ' If I 'm a telecom carrier , I want to be able to serve as many households and businesses as I can . ' <p> More than 250,000 homes in the Denver area can get AT &T's; high-speed service , called AT &T@Home.; It plans to add service throughout the metro area within three years and is upgrading networks in Boulder and Fort Collins . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but installation costs could apply . <p> Clint Smith , a 22-year-old software developer , has had AT &T@Home; at his Lakewood residence for about 11/2 years . <p> ' I 'm really glad I did it . It 's been awesome , ' he said . <p> Smith , who designs Web sites part-time , said it would take three hours to post a complex Web site to the Internet using dial-up . With cable , it takes 20 minutes , he said . He also likes to download music and movie trailers from the Internet . <p> ' It would seriously take me about an hour to download one song with the dial-up , ' he said . ' I can get it in 30 seconds . ' <p> Joseph R. Stackhouse , regional vice president of AT &T; cable services in Denver , said the lion 's share of his company 's focus is residential . <p> ' But we are beginning to turn our eyes toward business , ' he said . <p> Like DSL and wireless , cable offers an always-on connection , meaning no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share ' bandwidth , ' which can slow connection speeds . But AT &T; has a traffic management system , it says . <p> Cable companies compete against DSL providers , including Denver-based US West and Rhythms NetConnections , a Denver Tech Center company that is rolling the service out nationwide . US West has 100,000 subscribers in its 14-state region . Rhythms has just 12,500 subscribers . By the end of 2000 , Rhythms will serve 70 markets and more than 100 metropolitan areas nationwide . <p> Its expansion will cover about half of U.S. homes and businesses , but rural areas likely will be ignored for now . <p> ' Obviously , we are targeting the markets with the most potential , ' said Rick Adams , chief marketing officer . <p> A recent ruling by the Federal Communications Commission ordered companies such as US West to share their phone lines with companies like Rhythms . That means Rhythms ' customers - like US West customers now - would not need additional phone lines . Monthly prices should drop . <p> ' That opens the door for DSL much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cable is into a lot more homes than DSL right now . But if you look at the capability , everyone has a telephone line . ' <p> Rhythms ' residential DSL service costs about $ 50 a month . Business service can go as high as several hundred dollars a month . <p> DSL is n't foolproof . The greater the distance from a central telephone office , the slower the connection speed . Beyond 18,000 feet , or approximately 3 miles , DSL is not much faster than dial-up service . But companies are working to extend their reach . <p> Wireless companies such as United Online , based in the Tech Center , also have their high-speed niche : office buildings and businesses . <p> The company offers service locally using transmission towers atop the Wells Fargo building Downtown and in the Tech Center . The towers send signals to antennas that are linked to computers through phone lines . <p> But United is expanding to Spokane , San Francisco , New York , Dallas and Atlanta , said Martin Nicoulin , United Online 's director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers in Colorado . <p> ' Our typical customers are businesses , all sizes of business , ' he said . ' As we expand this out and the cost of the technology comes down , I think it will have residential appeal . ' <p> To download the latest version of Netscape Communicator , a 56K modem would take about seven hours . A low-end wireless connection can do it in about 70 minutes . <p> But fixed wireless has its problems . The signal needs a clear line of sight to get from a transmission tower to a building antenna . Providers can set up relays , but that can be expensive . <p> ' Until the network is built out we wo n't be able to saturate the regions like a cell phone , ' said Marcus Bronson , United Online 's chief technology officer . <p> But the industry is moving fast in that direction . In the next 18 months , United Online plans to add service in 18 cities . <p> ' We 're really excited , ' Bronson said . ' This can change @ @ @ @
