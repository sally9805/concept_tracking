Imagine your favorite music store is about to reopen after months of legal trouble , and you go in to find it a shadow of its former self . What few CDs it has are chained to the shelves , and the clerk says he 's negotiating with the two huge stores on either side to get the rest back . So you try the other stores , where the selection is just as incomplete . You still ca n't walk out with any music  --  and you have to keep paying every month just to listen to the few tunes in each store . Meanwhile , there are a bunch of kids on the corner who will give you any song you want , for as long as you want it , for free  --  just as your favorite store used to do . <P> That 's what it feels like to use the three paid digital-music services that are jockeying for your pocket in the wake of the old Napster 's demise . They are MusicNet , owned by three of the five big record labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prelaunch trial version of the newly legal Napster . All three are so restrictive , you would think you were downloading homeland-security documents , not ' N Sync . And because the record labels are still squabbling about Internet licensing , nobody has a complete selection except those street-corner kids : morally dubious services like Morpheus , on which free song swapping still flourishes . <P> MusicNet is a service found on both AOL ( part of the parent company of this magazine ) and Real Networks ' media player , RealOne . It costs $9.99 a month , and you get 100 downloads timed to expire at the end of that period . To hear them after a month , you must download them again . I barely remember to do the laundry every month ; now I have to renew my rights to Peggy Lee ? <P> Pressplay is a little less draconian . For $24.95 a month you get 100 downloads , and the tunes do n't expire as long as you remain a subscriber . You also get to burn 20 tracks onto a CD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes via modem . This was refreshing after all the transfer errors I 'm used to on Morpheus and its underground kin . Now all Pressplay needs is a catalog large enough that I might want 20 songs a month from it . <P> Napster 's trial version has much the same paltry-selection problem . But assuming it can get its hands on some licenses before it launches , the struggling service shows more promise than its record-label rivals . True , most songs are in the protected . nap format , which means you ca n't burn them onto a CD . But there are a few independent labels that let Napster offer M files that are yours for life . It is hoped more labels will follow suit . <P> Of course , every song from those kids on the street corner is a play-anywhere , burn-anytime M . The big guys may promise more with their secure and speedy downloads , but I 'm not switching until I get a file I can keep for , say , a buck a pop . Locking up your mediocre collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morpheus is at
