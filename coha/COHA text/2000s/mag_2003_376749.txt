Just how clever is Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , the intellectual godfather of the war on Iraq ? The memo he signed on Dec. 5 makes you wonder . The paper fleshed out for the public who is eligible to win prime contracts , funded by $18.6 billion of U.S. tax money , to rebuild Iraq 's infrastructure and supply its new army . Only firms from supportive nations can bid , which rules out those from antiwar countries like Russia , Germany , France and Canada . In its tact , timing and logic , the memo is a disaster . It was released just as the Bush Administration was launching an international effort to restructure Iraq 's debt , much of it held by the excluded nations . Its reasoning is sophomoric and its language , in the words of one diplomat , a sort of " diseased English . " Even on its own terms , the memo will not accomplish what it sets out to do , since companies from disfavored nations will still be able to work in Iraq , just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diplomatic row . <P> The justification for the memo , such as it is , warrants setting out in full . " It is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the United States , " writes Wolfowitz , " to limit competition for the prime contracts of those procurements to companies from the United States , Iraq , coalition partners and force-contributing nations . Therefore , it is clearly in the public interest to limit prime contracts to companies from these countries . " As a logical proposition , that paragraph can be reduced to the following : Because A , therefore A  --  the sort of tautology that would get any high school student a failing grade . <P> But the nonsense does n't stop there . The Pentagon policy was plainly designed to reward those countries that have supported the war and punish those that have opposed it . ( Let us gloss over that Turkey , which would not let U.S. troops transit to Iraq , is on the approved list , while Canada , which has sent cash to Iraq , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police force , are not . ) That , it appears , is the " essential security interest " that justifies limiting competition for these contracts . So you might suppose that it is similarly in the national interest to limit those that could win subcontracts too . <P> Not at all . Prime contractors can choose whomever they would like to do the real work in Iraq and have already done so . The giant U.S. construction firm Bechtel , for example , has about 150 subcontractors in Iraq , including companies from Germany and other nations that opposed the war . It 's easy to understand why . Much of Iraq 's ravaged infrastructure , which has been short of spare parts for more than a decade , was built by German , French or Russian firms . A prime contractor trying to repair power grids and oil-pumping stations would be doing a poor job if it did n't turn to the companies that installed them in the first place .                   @ @
