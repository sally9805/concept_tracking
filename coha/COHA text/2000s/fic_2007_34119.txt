Chapter One Day One The three men finished with the small boat before nightfall . The painting had to be done quickly and it was difficult . So afterward they rested and smoked in the drawing dusk , their backs against a massive rock . The boat was called a yola . They had spotted it bobbing near an island on a buoy in the natural harbor formed by the embrace of two small spits of land and hauled it ashore . With thick smears of black paint , they covered up its pale blue gray color , its name , Bonita , and the white numbers of its registration . Over the lights , they spread a thinner coat . At sea , even if perchance they ran with lights to avoid a reef , this silty covering would make the lights indistinct and fickle ; and someone might mistake them for a phosphorescent curiosity of the sea . Now they needed only to replace the engine with the larger one left for them the night before , beneath a tent of canvas concealed with branches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years in the same village in Santo Domingo . The younger man , an American barely twenty years old , could understand only some of the words they said . He might have been fluent by now but preferred not to be . Still , he could tell thatthey were talking about the way the sea always eventually gave up her fish , as well as other things . He heard the words for " weather " and " soup . " He knew these men as Ernesto and Carlo ; but he suspected these were not their true names . For these jobs , the men lived for a few weeks each year in Honduras , at the homes of people whose names they had been given . They were different people each time , cousins of acquaintances of men who knew these men by other names . At each place they stopped for food or rest , they would meet other people with no names . There seemed to be an endless supply of people who would forfeit names and memory for fifty American dollars . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They terrified him now . He did not expect to meet them again . The young man drew in the sweet smoke , laid his head back , and thought of his sister . The last time he had seen her , she had been seven years old , dressed for Halloween as a carousel horse , in an outfit their mother had made of black tights and papier-mch . He remembered his father saying that the young man did not need a costume to look like a freak . His mother pivoted on his father and defended him , a reflex on behalf of her cub . But the young man knew that he had disgraced her , too , as his brother , still in high school , had honored her . He had failed to finish high school . His brother brought home trophies and fine grades . His own experiments with drugs and drunkenness had nearly put him in jail and cost his father considerable money and even more shame among his circle of wealthy friends . He did not like sports . After the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned to quieter things . His mother had not minded , but his father spoke of him as a quitter . To the young man , the handsome , rough boys with their wide red mouths were embarrassing , almost frightening . He was not like the sons of his father 's friends . Long ago , they had gone off to Brown or Michigan State . His brother would go to a fine college one day also . Still , his brother did love him . And his mother loved him no less than she loved his brother . His mother thought he would come out of the ways he had never expected to go . The young man sometimes believed this , too . His thinking of it was interrupted when Ernesto said something conspiratorial to Carlo about offering a puff of their smoke to the owner of Bonita . This amused Carlo so much that he deliberately fell over on his back , laughing as only a servile man can , like a dog performing for its master . Carlo was stupid , which the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The owner of the little yola sat some distance away with his back also propped against a large rock . He made no comment on Ernesto 's offer because he was dead . Like a rare heron displaced from her environment , Olivia Montefalco high-stepped regally into the heat and blare of O'Hare International Airport . Though it was June , she wore a white wool suit with her high-heeled white sandals and huge diamond- stippled sunglasses . Those she passed were certain they had seen her before , perhaps in a magazine photograph . They fell back to make way . A grandmother rushing to meet her daughter for the Sunjet to Vegas thought that Olivia was that actress , the one from that movie about the artist whose boyfriend was a ghost ... ? It had been a sweet movie , without all the sex , sex , sex . She had short hair , like Olivia 's . A pilot who jumped down from a hotel shuttle-a little too athletically , but in a way he hoped would impress the flight attendants-was sure this woman had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike the gambling grandmother , he was correct . Oblivious to the stares from fellow travelers and haggard morning smokers , Olivia stood on her toes and scanned the ranks of limousines , SUVs , and police cars . Where was that huge thing Tracy drove ? The last time she 'd seen it , it had been filled to exhaustion by Cammie and about a dozen of her soccer mates , all chittering and smelling of sweaty socks . Olivia was amazed that Tracy could work full-time and cook for Jim and visit her parents and send letters and coach soccer as well . Perhaps now that Cammie was grown , she had a different car . Two skycaps trailed behind Olivia , like yoked oxen straining to push the teetering towers of Olivia 's turquoise Henk van de Meene luggage . Olivia stuffed their hands with crumpled wads of dollar bills and gave them a smile so candent that they felt something more than a tip had been bestowed . Olivia had shipped most of her belongings , but the bits and essentials that comforted her after twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Olivia bit her lip-a gesture that , when she was married to Franco , guaranteed jewelry within days-and wondered if Tracy had forgotten her . Olivia had n't written for months and months , not since Tracy 's flurry of phone calls and offerings of help during Franco 's illness . She did n't wonder if being left at the airport would serve her right . That was the kind of pondering that Olivia censored . With a sure hand and her cousin Janis riding shotgun , Tracy piloted her huge van around the arrivals tier . " There she is ! There 's Olivia ! Behind that weird luggage ! " Holly Solvig shrieked from the backseat . " Wonder how much extra that cost ! I 've never seen someone with so much baggage ! " " We already knew that , " Janis said dryly . Tracy remonstrated softly , " Jan . Hols . Come on . If it is Olivia , it 's Olivia . You knew she was wealthy . What I hope is that I have the right airline and the right day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice in twenty years , once for her brother 's wedding , once for her father 's funeral . Each time Holly and Tracy had come to fetch her , the encounter had been the same : Olivia changed her entire appearance the way other women changed the color of their nail polish . But since neither Holly nor Tracy ever changed , she never failed to recognize them ; and she did not now . " I told you it was her , Trace , " Holly repeated triumphantly . " Look , she sees us ! She 's giving the Godmother wave . " Tracy glanced back , nearly colliding with a Saab . It was their wave , the American Sign Language letter y , an extended forefinger and thumb . " Look at those sunglasses . She looks like Mario SanGiaccamo 's mother at the country club pool in 1970 ! She 's Westbrookian all over ! Now it 's going to take a half hour to come back around again to get her ! " Holly felt like a fool , a forty-two-year-old woman making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van . She tried to cover by making other ASL signs she 'd picked up over the years at the hospital , those for " Not true " and " Talk to me , " so onlookers might think she actually was talking to someone who was deaf . " No way ! " Janis cried now . " Whoever that woman is , she 's at least ten years younger than we are ! " Suddenly , all three women , as if each heard a gunshot at the starting line , covertly found something reflective in the car and began the kind of inventory reserved for buying a bathing suit . Each was thinking variations on the same theme : If this was their old friend , then her appearance was more magical than surgical . " But it is so too her ! " Holly insisted , reverting to adolescent language now , up on her knees and peering out the back window . " That 's Olivia Seno , the Duchess Montefalco- " " It 's countess , " Tracy corrected her . " And you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She could be the Count of Monte Crisco for all I know , " Holly said . " All I know is , she 's trying to get you to back up ! " Abruptly , Tracy braked and , through sheer General Motors muscle , with Holly yelling , " There 's a very sick woman back there ! We need to get her to help ! Move ! " backed her van through a bleating horde of protesting vehicles toward Olivia . She jumped up and wrinkled her nose in delight . The rest of them smiled with various degrees of moxie . Olivia 's shiny appearance , like an advertisement for the benefits of folic acid , made all of them aware of their damp armpits and Thursday morning hair , Jan 's and Tracy 's yoga pants and Holly 's cutoffs , so tight that she would have dislocated her thumb trying to put her hand into the pocket . Twenty-five years ago , the four of them had been inseparable , a fighting unit with black fishnet stockings under their navy plaid school uniforms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shoulders . Unholy innocents , they 'd stalked the halls of St. Ursula High , cracking gum and cracking wise . Tough girls who 'd never thrown a punch , they posed as scofflaws but never missed their curfews . Twenty-five years ago , they 'd baptized themselves the Godmothers ( in homage to the movie everyone had seen at least ten times ) . Even Holly-who , unlike the others , did n't have a drop of Italian blood-had to dye her naturally flaxen hair to the color and texture of a witch 's hat . In ninth grade , they 'd run a double-D cup up the flagpole . They 'd watched from their third-floor math class as Sister Mary Vincent fought the March wind to pull it down , without allowing the flags of the order and the United States to touch the ground , because the janitor , a meek man called Vili , was too abashed to touch it . In tenth grade , once Janis and Tracy had their driver 's licenses and Saturday night use of their grandfather 's Bonneville , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright boys from Fenton High and go parking in the delivery lot behind the golf course , four couples on two leather bench seats . On a dare , they 'd drunk whiskey Janis had pilfered from behind the bar at her father 's steakhouse as they 'd sat on Alphonse Capone 's grave in Holy Innocents Cemetery . In eleventh grade , they 'd sprayed across the principal 's parking space , " We 're the crew that brought the brew to the roof of St. U ! " By senior year , Olivia was so madly involved with a college boy from Loyola that Tracy got horrible hives , scoring her arms into tracks of welts , because she needed to do both her and Livy 's term papers for Honors English and civ . Then the Loyola boy fell for Anna Kruchenko , and Olivia used scissors from art class to cut off Anna 's twenty-inch braid a week before prom . A week after prom , Olivia 's mother had a hysterectomy . While the adult women murmured darkly of " C-A , " Olivia came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Olivia lost twenty pounds , opening huge hollows under the cheekbones that framed her huge eyes . Girls back then wore five , seven , and nine-not two and four . Plu-skinny as rote was not yet ordained . But Olivia 's wraithlike beauty drove boys to fight over her like rutting elk , sometimes on the sidewalk in front of Tracy 's house . And though Livy had almost never again allowed herself to be anything but concave , she confessed to Tracy that she had made a holy vow to eat nothing but bread if her mother would live , that she had been shoveling peas and pork chops into her table napkin every night . Those nights had been the only time Tracy had ever seen Olivia cry . She had not cried even in the hospital in Florence . Their principal , Mother Bernard , had to explain to her young sisters ( and there were young nuns then , though fewer each year ) that there were two kinds of bad girls . One kind did not possess the DNA to turn out bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would grow up to be teachers , parents , and professionals . Perhaps one of them would even have a vocation . The young nuns prayed that if one of them did , she 'd be a Benedictine and cloistered for life . But in everything but this one matter , Mother Bernard had been exactly correct . Holly was a nurse and the mother of twins . Janis stayed home with her two daughters until they reached high school age and was only now resuscitating her event-planning business , which she ran from home . Tracy taught gym classes in the gym where she 'd learned to play basketball . And Olivia ! Olivia had made of herself something remarkable , although only by dint of looks and luck . When they spoke of Olivia , it was always Holly who pointed out that Olivia had not discovered radium , she had simply married up . Still , despite Holly 's protests , it was true : The others ' lives had been cut from a single pattern-different only because one might have chosen short sleeves , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westbrook , a bumper suburb on the hip of Chicago that Holly once called the town without a soul . All their parents were ten-minute immigrants from the west side , with nothing but blue-collar grit and the best intentions for their children . Janis 's father built the Grub Steak and threw in on founding a golf club even before he and the other town fathers got around to building their own church . All the girls were bused to St. Ursula in Belleview one town over , all the boys to Fenton in Parkside . An elementary school was built the second year that Westbrook was incorporated . But no one would have considered anything but parochial school for his or her children . Janis 's and Tracy 's fathers were brothers who 'd married cousins . Among the two families ' six children , Janis and Tracy were the only girls and were raised essentially as sisters . The eight Loccario grandchildren still celebrated their birthdays at Tony 's restaurant , the Grub Steak . After a martini , he would recall for them when Westbrook had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of houses surrounded by forlorn prairie , with distant moans and grumbles from the freight trains that rattled the china in everyone 's hutch and the bewildered hoots of owls perched on bulldozers . There were prairie fires and muskrat . Janis always said Grandpa made the children believe they 'd been pioneers in North Dakota . When the time came , Tracy went to Champaign on a basketball scholarship . Janis went to Triton Junior College and toyed with marketing , as well as with every boy in a twenty-mile radius . Janis was so winsome with her thick auburn blunt cut and her perky rear end that Tracy could n't believe they 'd come from the same gene pool . Janis turned Dave on and off like a faucet until , in dental school , he made a play for a sassy classmate . Rapidly , Janis had given her hand but , unlike Tracy , not her last name . Dave 's surname was Chawson . " It might be dental , " Janis opined , " but it 's not musical . " Olivia , meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the ending had been appropriately tragic , hence Livy 's triste return to her homeland . " She 's going to have to sit on my lap if we 're going to fit that stuff in here , " Holly groused as Olivia began the prodigious task of overseeing the loading of her luggage . Put that there-no , no , that has glass in it-on top , that 's right .... " At least you wo n't feel her , " Janis said . " Do you think she weighs a hundred pounds ? " " Why are we taking her on a cruise ? " Holly asked sotto voce . As only a teacher could do , Tracy gave Holly the Look . She whispered , " Because she 's a widow , and we love her , and for your information , she paid for everything except the airfare ! Be nice ! " (
