Ry Cooder 's 1997 collaboration with a group of septuagenarian Cuban musicians , Buena Vista Social Club , sold 8 million copies and earned a Grammy for Best Tropical Latin Performance . It also earned Cooder a $100,000 fine from the U.S. government . " I learned that what Buena Vista means to the people who enforce the Cuba trade and travel embargo , " says Cooder , " is not very much . " <P> The fine was reduced to $25,000 , but Cooder was ordered to stay out of Cuba at the precise moment the public was thirsting for more Cuban music . On the last day of the Clinton presidency  --  after Cooder had lobbied the State Department for two years  --  he was given a one-year exemption from the travel ban . The result is Mambo Sinuendo , Cooder 's playful , dueling guitar album with Manuel Galban . " I knew that I wanted to work with the Buena Vista musicians again because , hey , many of them are geniuses , " says Cooder . " But Manuel 's the most surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had n't figured on . " <P> Most Cuban musicians stick close to the technical requirements of their discipline . " For whatever reason , " says Cooder , " Galban has made adjustments during his life , and he 's developed into a free player . He breaks away from patterns and styles in ways that other Cubans do n't . That suits the electric guitar really well , and it also allowed us as collaborators to kind of meet in the middle , ' cause I 'm not Cuban . " Mambo Sinuendo has moments where it sounds like the sound track to a particularly cool Havana nightclub , but the two players achieve a dynamic so loose and easy that they also float over Africa , Mexico , Hawaii and Birdland , incorporating whatever style catches their ears . <P> That freedom belies the geopolitical and logistical circumstances under which Mambo was recorded . Cooder and Galban , 72 , tried to create a lifetime 's worth of musical repartee in pressure-packed 10-hour recording sessions . ( During his exemption , Cooder also produced an album by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in March . ) " Because every minute counts , " says Cooder , " you pretty much just keep the tape running . " The continual recording paid off when Galban walked into the studio one day , sat down at the piano and played Bolero Sonambulo , Mambo 's best track , fully formed . " You knew right away that this was nothing he 'd written or thought about , " says Cooder . " He 's just sitting down . So I ran in and grabbed a guitar . If you had stopped and said , ' Start this again , ' it would never have happened . " <P> Cooder faces imprisonment by the U.S. government if he returns to Cuba , which means Mambo and the Ferrer album are the end of his Cuban excursions . " It 's totally impossible for me to go back until some comprehensive change occurs in the embargo , " says Cooder . " The sad thing is , these players are indispensable , and none of them are getting younger . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
