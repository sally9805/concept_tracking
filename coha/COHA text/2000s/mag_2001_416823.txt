THE ISSUES CONFRONTING the church in our time are many . I have chosen three of them , well aware that this choice is doubtless both biased and incomplete . And I am also certainly under the influence of the situation in northern Europe , where the churches are exposed to the eroding influence of secularization . Nevertheless , I will risk a brief analysis of the contemporary Western person . 1 . The feeble perception of sacramental reality . The contemporary person is in love with rites and ritualization , but is allergic to the Christian sacraments . The Western churches of established Christianity are passing through a profound crisis in their perception of sacramentality . It is as though the Western person has a blind spot . In pastoral ministry , priests are tempted to fall back and focus in their ministry on word and diakonia ( " service " ) . The situation is aggravated by the decline in the number of priests . Photograph // In any event , sacraments are no longer the center of gravity for Catholic pastoral care . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word and the relevance of diaconal service in the church , they understand and appreciate far less the reality of the sacramental world . As a result , liturgy risks being dominated largely by an excess of words or of being merely a way to recharge one 's batteries for diakonia and social action . The church seems to be nothing more than a place where one speaks and where one places oneself at the service of the world . The sacramental life is shifting from the center of the church to its periphery . Is it , perhaps , a matter of a slow and unconscious Protestantization of the church from within ? In any event , this orientation could have serious consequences for the nature of the church , of the ordained ministry and of the sacraments . It could even destroy the proper Catholic conception of preaching , which is not primarily marketing rhetoric , and of diakonia , which is not mere philanthropy . The causes are doubtless many and varied . In any case , it is not , as some contend , the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has there been such an infatuation with rites as in our day : they sprout like the luxuriant vegetation of a tropical forest . One invents-and markets-secular and cosmic rites or rites linked to natural religion for all the great passages of human life : birth , puberty , marriage and death . Have we returned to the times of the Celtic druids or the mystery religions ? What is at stake here is the historical and Christological foundation of Christian sacramental rites that uniquely distinguish the sacraments of the church from universal human symbols and rites . Moreover , rites of natural religion all come up against-without being able to resolve them-three problems confronting all of us : finitude , death and sin . These rites are not able to provide conversion of heart ; rather , they promise only therapeutic illusions and/or the self-redemption of man or woman . Thus we proclaim the word and we practice diakonia . But we also guard the most precious treasure of the Catholic Church : liturgy and the sacraments . Does not the " Constitution on the Liturgy " of the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is the source from which everything flows and that it is the end toward which everything it undertakes for the salvation of humankind converges ? 2 . The need for participation : Modern men and women love participation and have difficulty with authority . The theme of collegiality in the church is , whether one wants it to be or not , at the top of the agenda in ecclesial public opinion and in the media . It is , moreover , eminently " conciliar . " While the world is expanding and is increasingly diversified , it also wants to be more and more one . Here is an enormous challenge for the church in the future : to remain firmly one but generously diversified and inculturated . This is also the perennial paradox of the church : the relationship between Peter and the Eleven , between the Petrine primacy and the collegiality of the bishops . This paradox is congenital and spans the millennia . For the third millennium , the problem of collegiality will certainly be one of the great challenges facing us . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some dream of solving the problem by exalting one of the two poles to the detriment of the other : either by elevating the primacy of Peter to the detriment of the episcopal college or by reducing the role of Peter in favor of the bishops . Yet the solution can not be to dance on one foot . It is in the reinforcement of the two poles : both primacy and collegiality . An expanding world-with all its differences but in search of unity-needs a strong Peter and a strong episcopal college . We do not as yet have the instrument perfectly suited to achieve this equilibrium ; our " tools " to activate collegiality are not ready . We must find a more precise and effective configuration and articulation among four components : the Roman Curia , the conferences of bishops , the synods and the consistory of the cardinals . What my brother cardinals have proposed regarding a certain decentralization vis-d-vis the local churches-in the procedure for appointing bishops , the administration of justice in the church and also regarding the relations between the Curia and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution is not immediately achievable . The synod of bishops is certainly the privileged instrument of collegiality . But its functioning has to be perfected . As it now functions , it does not allow for real debate in the episcopal college around Peter . The first two weeks offer an interesting " geographical map " of the problem , as John Paul II phrased it one day . The third week-that of the small groups-is too short and poorly directed : it does not permit a true confrontation of ideas . The reports in plenary session that follow are , quite frankly , disappointing . As far as the fourth week is concerned , it is overtime work that painfully produces a few propositions . Fortunately , the Holy Father saves the day by writing the post-synodal exhortation . It is necessary to foster a true culture of debate in the church . It is true that the synodal fathers themselves could be more frank and more pertinent in their interventions . The fault does not lie only in the method of procedure ( ord &; procedendi ) . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a time for homilies and a time for synodal interventions . Should one fear debate in the church ? If all the synodal fathers place the love of the church above their personal preferences or those of their constituencies , if they have the courage to shelter themselves from undue exterior influences , if they live in a profound faith in the Petrine ministry and in the assistance of the Holy Spirit , a culture of debate in the church would be beneficial and even indispensable . One must not forget that a synod , before being a matter of the management of the church , is first of all of the order of celebration . The Holy Spirit is there . 3 . The human person hesitates before the True , is impotent before the Good , but loves Beauty . To evangelize contemporary men and women , it is certainly necessary for the evangelizer to be solidly rooted in Scripture and tradition . But it is equally necessary that the evangelizer have a profound affinity with the culture of the time . It would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also of our laity , if we were to be confined by pusillanimity to an " in vitro " educational curriculum . It is absolutely necessary that evangelizers be made aware of the immense richness of contemporary culture : science and technology , the life of the mind in its diverse currents , literature , arts , the theater-in short , the entire enthralling life of the world today . Our priests and committed laity certainly need a solid framework of biblical , dogmatic and moral knowledge that resists the autumnal tempests of an aging civilization menaced by cultural osteoporosis . They have no less need of nerves sensitive to the variations of their cultural environment supersensitive nerves . In the same train of thought , I ask myself whether we are using sufficiently one of the doors that leads to God  --  the door named Beauty . Indeed , God is Truth , Holiness and Moral Perfection , but God is also Beauty . One can find God through the door of truth , for truth attracts us . But many of our contemporaries are little Pilates who ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door without entering . God as Moral Perfection and Holiness also attracts us . But many will say : " Moral perfection attracts me , but I 'm incapable of it , " and they remain outside that door marked by their moral weaknesses . But beauty disarms : it is irresistible for contemporary men and women . Young students discuss and study courses on questions of dogma ( the True ) and morality ( the Good ) . But after a performance of the " Passion According to Saint Matthew " by Johann Sebastian Bach , they are disarmed and left speechless . The church has so many beautiful things to say and to show to the world , not only in its artistic heritage , but also in so many saints who shone with beauty . ( To name only two , there are Francis of Assisi with his Canticle of the Sun and John of the Cross and his poems . ) There is much more here than aesthetics . For those who would still doubt , allow me to remind them that beauty has everything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . " And beauty has everything to do with the good . The Greeks even made it into one single word : kaloskagathos . Beauty can make a synthesis of the true and the good . Truth , Goodness , Beauty . Here are three names and three access roads to God . But Beauty has as yet been explored very little in theology and catechesis in our day . Is it not time to attend to this lacuna ?
