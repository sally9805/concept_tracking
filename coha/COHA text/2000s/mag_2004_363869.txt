Let us travel back to a very bad time . Not A.D. 30 . That was a fairly bad time . No , to a period roughly 650 years ago . The Black Death was ravaging Europe , killing upwards of 20 million people . The survivors fought in what was known as the 100 Years ' War . Add grueling poverty . They called it the Middle Ages . And from it emerged ... Mel Gibson 's new movie , The Passion of the Christ . <P> Those who walk into their multiplexes wondering whether Gibson 's film is anti-Semitic will find answers according to their standards . Mine was that it is , in a stock , caricatured way . Romans do the actual torturing , and a handful of " good " Jews seem to defy cliche , but the folks controlling the mob and forcing their overlord 's seemingly pliable hand are the same band of swarthy miscreants that have wandered through Passion plays for centuries . <P> Yet the film 's true shock lies in Gibson 's vision of what is most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pornographic feast of flayed flesh . Gibson gives us Christ 's blood , not in a Communion cup , but by the gallon . Blood spraying from Jesus ' shackled body ; blood sluicing to the Cross 's foot . This Passion begins just before Jesus ' arrest . It ends with a blink-length Resurrection . The bulk of his ministry , miracles and post-Resurrection appearances are absent , and his preaching of love flicked at in telegraphically brief flashbacks . Meanwhile , his scourging , handled in all four Gospels in a total of three sentences , takes up nine full minutes of film . <P> Western Christianity has seen this treatment before , although not before about A.D. 1000 . The stunning concept of divine self-sacrifice  --  " Jesus Christ and him crucified , " as Paul put it  --  is the faith 's heart , bound inextricably with his glorious rising three days later . But the grisly specifics of his mortification before then were of little interest to most Christians until the turn of the second millennium . <P> It was starting in the 1300s that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering in allegedly prophetic verses in the Old Testament . Mystics built devotions around his scourging after a Cardinal returned from the Holy Land bearing the pillar to which he said Christ had been chained . Flagellant lay groups clogged the streets , seeking bloody identification with the flayed Christ . So dominant grew the Passion , writes Catholic historian Gerard Sloyan , that believers felt " meditation on it alone could achieve unity with Christ and yield some share in the work of redemption he accomplished . " It came to overshadow not just " the Incarnation , but even the Resurrection . " <P> Sloyan does not regard this as a good thing , but never once does he suggest that it was inexplicable . It derived in part from the everyday misery and terror facing average believers . However badly they suffered , they thought , Jesus must have suffered more . If they dedicated their torments to his , others concluded , it might lend sanctity to the senseless . Little wonder that one mystic reported that Christ had told her , " I was beaten on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ; pricks of thorns in the head , 110 ... mortal thorns in the forehead , 3 ... the drops of blood that I lost were 28,430.
