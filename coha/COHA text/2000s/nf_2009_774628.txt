STRATFORD 1564 // Here begins the plague // ... // Exit pursued by a bear : antigonus is torn to pieces . a clownish young shepherd witnesses his death on land and many more losses on the sea as a tempest-tossed ship is swallowed by the waves . " A sad tale ? s best for winter , " little Prince Mamillius has said , before being struck by death himself . But Shakespeare ? s Winter ? s Tale veers from tragedy to comedy . Young Shepherd ? s breathless description of heavy matters is counterpointed against Old Shepherd ? s amazed discovery of new life in the form of the abandoned baby Perdita . " Thou met ? st with things dying , " he serenely remarks to his son , " I with things new born . " // In Shakespeare ? s England , birth and death went cheek by jowl . Each entry in the parish register of Holy Trinity Church , Stratford-upon- Avon , is encoded with a single letter : C for christened , M for married , and B for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death : human life stripped to its essentials . Shortly after the entry that reads " 1564 , Apr. 26 . C. Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakspere "  --  April 26 , 1564 , christened , William , son of John Shakespeare  --  the entries marked B begin to thicken on the page . There were no more than twenty deaths in the first half of 1564 , well over two hundred in the second . The population of this small but prosperous market town in the English Midland county of Warwickshire was about fifteen hundred , so more than one in seven were taken in those few months of devastation . The cause is duly noted in a marginal annotation opposite the burial entry for Oliver Gunne , apprentice : hic incepit pestis . Here begins the plague . // In August , the town council met in emergency session in the garden of the Gild Chapel , hoping that the outdoor air would be less contagious than that of the Gild Hall . They discussed relief for the plague victims . " Burgess " ( councillor ) John Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the townspeople may be glimpsed from a contemporary account of a plague outbreak in London . If just one member of a family was struck down , the rest would have been closed up in the house to prevent the spread of infection : // What an unmatchable torment were it for a man to be barred up every night in a vast silent charnel-house ? Hung ( to make it more hideous ) with lamps dimly and slowly burning , in hollow and glimmering corners : where all the pavement should , instead of green rushes , be strewed with blasted rosemary , withered hyacinths , fatal cypress and yew , thickly mingled with heaps of dead men ? s bones : the bare ribs of a father that begat him , lying there : here the chapless hollow skull of a mother that bore him . // The previous year , John and Mary Shakespeare had lost their infant Margaret at four months , and sometime before that , another girl , Joan . Cause of deaths unknown . But the loss not uncommon  --  everyone knew infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William was what every respectable couple wanted : a son to maintain the family name and estate . His sex was their first stroke of good fortune . Second was his survival of the plague . What John and Mary could never know was that he would not merely survive , but make the Shakespeare name live as long as humankind has books and stories . // Plague was the single most powerful force shaping his life and those of his contemporaries . John Stow ? s annals of English history summarized the key events of the year of Shakespeare ? s birth . The previous autumn , Londoners had suffered terribly : " Forsomuch as the plague of pestilence was so hot in the city of London , there was no term kept at Michaelmas : to be short , the poor citizens of London were this year plagued with a threefold plague , pestilence , scarcity of money , and dearth of victuals : the misery whereof , were too long here to write , no doubt the poor remember it , the rich by flight into the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominated " Citizen of London " on his title page , would not have bothered to record an outbreak of plague in a small town in the Midlands . There is London and there is the rest of England . London is far bigger than every other conurbation . It is more densely populated , so the spread of plague is more rapid . And it is the location of the institutions that govern the nation : the royal court , the houses of Parliament and the law courts , Lambeth Palace ( London residence of the archbishop of Canterbury and administrative headquarters of the Church of England ) . In bad times , the rich and their institutions could take flight to the country , leaving the London poor to shift for themselves . The royal court was supremely mobile , with the queen moving on a whim or a plague warning from Whitehall in central London to one of her other palaces  --  Greenwich downstream , Hampton Court upstream , Richmond or Windsor secluded in their deer parks , or Nonsuch deep in rural Surrey . // It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four terms of the legal year , when the courts were in session . During times of plague , as in Michaelmas term ( October to December ) 1563 and Hilary term ( January to March ) 1564 , the judges and lawyers met out of town . Throughout Shakespeare ? s professional career , there were close links between the worlds of law and theater . Many of his fellow dramatists trained at the Inns of Court . Law students were a key element of the theater audience . Hack writer Tom Nashe railed against the " tedious dead vacation " when there were no lawyers to see his plays or buy his pamphlets . And , like the law courts , the acting companies traveled out of town when plague was severe . // So it was that plague determined several turning points in Shakespeare ? s career . In January 1593 , just as he was making his name as an actor turned playwright , an order went out from the Privy Council : " Forasmuch as by the certificate of the last week it appeareth the infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all manner of concourse and public meetings of the people at plays , bear- baitings , bowlings and other like assemblies for sports be forbidden . " Save for a few weeks ? remission the following winter , the theaters remained closed for a year and a half . The actors toured , while a different Shakespeare emerged . The rewrite man , the patcher of old plays from the existing repertoire , turned himself into an original poet . In April 1593 , he published " the first heir " of his " invention , " Venus and Adonis . Its stylistic brilliance and risqu ? content made his name among the smart set . It became the bestselling long poem of the age , the favored reading of undergraduates and Inns of Court men . Dedicated to Henry Wriothesley , the third earl of Southampton , it was also a bid for patronage . // The dedicatory epistle that begins the more serious and rhetorically elaborate follow-up poem , The Rape of Lucrece , published the next year , suggests that the bid was successful . Where Shakespeare ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful expectation , " the one attached to Lucrece speaks repeatedly of " duty " and devoted service : " What I have done is yours , what I have to do is yours , being part in all I have , devoted yours . " There is a strong possibility that Shakespeare spent part of the plague year in some form of service in Southampton ? s household at Titchfield in Hampshire . // The association with Southampton had three key consequences . It transformed Shakespeare from jobbing playwright to courtly poet , marked him out as the crossover man who could appeal equally to penny- paying groundlings and powerful courtiers or even the queen herself . Politically , it brought him into the orbit of the earl of Essex , to whom young Southampton was devoted . This would have potentially dangerous consequences a few years later . And intellectually , it introduced him to the work of the Anglo-Italian man of letters John Florio , Southampton ? s tutor , through whom he was exposed to Italian culture and , later , the essays of Michel de Montaigne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . // The plague of 1593-94 provided an enforced sabbatical after which Shakespeare returned to the theater with a new-minted verbal art . In the next couple of years , he wrote the plays in which his literary style truly matures : the dazzlingly intellectual ( Florioesque ) Love ? s Labour ? s Lost , the miraculously imaginative Midsummer Night ? s Dream , and the quicksilver Romeo and Juliet , with its growth from love ? s artifice to the heart ? s authenticity . When Mercutio dies with the words " A plague o ? both your houses , " it is no idle oath : the play was written in the aftermath of a period when the households of many members of Shakespeare ? s London audience would have been struck by plague . And plague is indeed subtly woven into the plot : the reason Romeo does not get Friar Laurence ? s crucial letter is that Friar John is detained for fear that he might have been infected . Parents are supposed to die before their children , the old before the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tragic irony of Romeo and Juliet is that the houses of both Capulet and Montague escape the plague , yet still the children die first . The final scene takes place in an ancestral tomb , but those who lie dead are the flower of a city ? s youth  --  Mercutio , Tybalt , Paris , Juliet , and her Romeo . // Plague also shapes the deep structure of Shakespeare ? s imaginative world . As Queen Elizabeth secluded herself from infection at Richmond and Nonsuch , so Ferdinand King of Navarre and his courtiers in Love ? s Labour ? s Lost enclose themselves in a garden world . As A Midsummer Night ? s Dream counterpoints city and court ( Athens ) against green world and fairy lore ( the wood ) , so Shakespeare always moved between two worlds : London for business and busy-ness , Stratford for home and rest . The classical poet Horace made a distinction between negotium ( social , mercantile , legal , and political transactions , the pursuit of wealth and power ) , always associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastoral idleness ) , found on his country farm . Whenever asked " business or pleasure ? " we are inheritors of that Horatian choice . Pleasure is otium , business its opposite ( the word negotium is derived from otium and the prefix nec , " not " ) . Like a second Rome , London was synonymous with negotium , while the quiet town on the edge of the Forest of Arden represented otium . Shakespeare knew all about the dialectic of Horace ? s two worlds from his reading in generations of pastoral literature , but he also lived the difference every time he walked or rode from his rented lodgings in London to his own home in Stratford . Plague was a key factor in determining the frequency of those journeys . // Mewling and puking // ... // Even if you grow up to become the greatest writer the world has ever seen , you begin like every other baby , mewling and puking . When William Shakespeare was born in April 1564 , he doubtless mewled because he had come into the world that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But in whose arms ? Jaques addresses his " seven ages " speech to a group of courtiers . In their world , a baby would have been passed straight to a wet nurse , so it is dramatically appropriate that the infant is imagined mewling and puking in the nurse ? s arms , not a mother ? s . Shakespeare ? s mother , Mary , claimed kinship with the illustrious Warwickshire family of Arden , but is unlikely to have been in the position to hire a wet nurse . Twenty years later , Shakespeare ? s wife , Anne , would breast-feed her own daughter . // But perhaps we should not attach too much significance to the choice of nurse as opposed to mother . Nurse could simply mean " nourisher . " Shakespeare may have been the first person to take the word out of the nursery and use it in its modern sense , to apply it to general health care as opposed to the specific context of rearing an infant . In The Comedy of Errors , when the confusion created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes so intense that Antipholus of Ephesus is supposed to have gone mad , his wife , Adriana , says // I will attend my husband , be his nurse , Diet his sickness , for it is my office , And will have no attorney but myself , And therefore let me have him home with me. // The juxtaposition of " nurse , " usually associated with mothers and infants , and " attorney , " a word belonging to the grown-up male world of the legal profession ( " And then the justice . . . " ) , is typical of Shakespeare ? s mingling of both " the ages of man " and the customary roles of men and women . // There aren ? t many babies in the plays . In tragedy and history , we hear whispers of sterility and infanticide . Richard III has no compunction in ordering the murder of the princes in the Tower , King Lear curses the womb of his eldest daughter , Goneril , and Macbeth is tormented by the fact that he has no children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nipple from a baby ? s boneless gums and dashing its brains out . Given that she is a lady and a future queen of Scotland , the image of her doing her own breast-feeding , rather than relying on a wet nurse , is an additional startling detail to set beside the violence . // The few babies that do appear  --  prop dolls , one assumes  --  are given a hard time . When Paulina in The Winter ? s Tale brings Leontes his newborn daughter , she describes in beautiful detail how a baby appears to be a miniaturized " print " of its parent : // Behold , my lords , Although the print be little , the whole matterAnd copy of the father : eye , nose , lip , The trick of ? s frown , his forehead , nay , the valley , The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek , his smiles , The very mould and frame of hand , nail , finger . // But Leontes is convinced his wife has been unfaithful to him : // This brat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and together with the damCommit them to the fire ! // Paulina ? s husband saves the baby and takes her to the wilds of Polixenes ? own kingdom of Bohemia . For his pains , he exits where we began  --  pursued by a bear , leaving the baby , named Perdita , " the lost one , " to be found by the shepherds , raised as a shepherdess , and theatrically transformed back to the princess she was born to be . // In the bloody Roman play Titus Andronicus , it looks for a moment as though the black baby born of the clandestine affair between villainous Aaron the Moor and Tamora , queen of Goths and empress of Rome , will also be dispatched at birth . //
