I was in the kitchen when the FBI arrived . I had no idea who they were at first . Just two guys coming up the front walk . I felt the Watch Tower heading my way , I sensed conversion , vacuum cleaners , rubbery soap in small plastic buckets that could clean anything yet protect the surface . <p> I threw Karen 's raincoat over my T-shirt and undies and let them in . <p> They showed me their badges . The one named Jerry had an unfilled vinyl penholder in his pocket-blue ink marks from pens that had moved in and out . Cyril had short hair , his black bangs combed down flat against his forehead as if he were living out a Gothic fantasy . Elvis , my station wagon , was still in the drive . Repossession happened to my mother once . The bumper sticker was there when I bought it . Just : Elvis . <p> - We 'd like to speak to Karen Jansen , Cyril said . <p> - Jensen . She 's asleep . <p> I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the misfire in her brain went completely nuts she woke up screaming . It was always Frankenstein , smashing beakers , overturning tables to get to her , and then she jolted out of sleep . When Karen 's lungs opened up , she extinguished all other sound from our neighborhood . <p> We lived by the county animal shelter in Santa Cruz . Karen thought she knew each time one of them was put to sleep . She wanted to have a small dog she could stuff into her coat , she said , keep in her closet , since we were n't allowed to have pets where we lived . She was twenty-one then , I was a year older . <p> - Perhaps you could wake Miss Jensen , Jerry said . <p> They sat down at the kitchen table . <p> I tapped on Karen 's door . She had a thin cotton rug in front of it that read WELCOME in bright yellow dye on a field of pink . <p> - Uh , uh , she said . <p> I cracked the door open . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . <p> I found her sitting up in the dark , her curtains pulled tight . Her small body was shrined by her canopy bed , her face damp and pink . Her blankets , all her sheets , pink . <p> - Did you hear me last night ? He hooked me up to this big machine . He was going to electrocute me , he was going to take my brain and put it into a woman 's head , Karen said . <p> - Frankenstein ? <p> The hall light was directed onto the ruffles of the canopy and made a scalloped shadow on her face , kind of sexy , almost noir . <p> - It has to stop , she whimpered . <p> - You need to see a doctor . <p> One of her boyfriends , the guy who would have studied pre-med if his mother had put her house up for sale , referred to Karen 's nighttime episodes as endogenous , human electrical shocks . A closed system of current , he said , as if he knew something . <p> I stayed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her score and iron her face . Karen wore lots of rings . She had the kind that interlocked , the ones that contained secret compartments-she even had a black ring that depicted a couple in the act , Scorpio etched at the bottom in tiny gold letters . <p> - You could have a sleep study done , I said . <p> - Maybe you do n't mind getting glue in your hair , she said . <p> Karen turned away from me . She did n't go into the bank where she worked as a teller until ten . <p> - You want some coffee ? I said . <p> -I want to stop dying . <p> But she got out of bed and looked through the hinged side of the door to see Cyril 's back at the kitchen table . She sent me out into the hall again . <p> I closed the bathroom door so Cyril and Jerry would n't look at Karen 's dangling blouses . She washed her bank clothes out at night and hung them over the tub , propped the window open so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub , cross ventilation running over my nipples , silk juice sprinkling me while she danced with some guy out in the living room . Slow danced and necked as cars traveled up the road toward the pound . <p> * * * <p> - Where do you work ? Cyril asked . <p> - Sam 's Wetsuit Factory . <p> I told them I was a gluer . Seams . I glued seams , I said . Other women sew . I want to move into cutting , but that takes training , and mostly they hire guys for that work . <p> The wetsuit factory was a segmented , punch-clock society . <p> I filled the aluminum coffee pot , got the flame going . <p> - You glue all day ? Cyril asked . <p> - You wear a gas mask or something ? Jerry said . He pushed the spoon against the limp Cheerios left over from breakfast . We watched them bob and rise to the top of the bowl again . <p> - Some people wear painters ' masks . But I 'm allergic to the elastic bands . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at Jerry . <p> - Just my hands . They shake . <p> - Cindy , could you come here a minute , please ? Karen called . <p> She closed the door behind me and yanked me over to her closet . Lifting the lid on a shoebox , she showed me the bundle of twenties wedged against new white sneakers . <p> - If they take me to be questioned , ditch this . <p> I considered what she was asking me to do . <p> -I do n't think any of your boyfriends deserve you , I said . <p> - You 're so weird . <p> -I would have loaned you money , I said . <p> I thought she was going to hug me . <p> But I had to go back and entertain the guys while she dressed . <p> - You two been roommates long ? Jerry asked . He leaned back in the red vinyl chair and tipped toward the kitchen sink . Karen kept a variety of dish detergents on the sill . She could never find one gentle enough . Green , yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dotted Jerry 's face and suit coat . He pitched forward again . <p> -A year ago last December . <p> A breeze came through the open door , and I picked up the scent of dogs . <p> I put five scoops of coffee into the water , without using a filter basket . Karen thought this was a glue-related problem . But my mother made coffee that way . She boiled it pretty hard . And she was unaffected by fumes , never saw the surf , barely acknowledged seams . My mother was a Christian Scientist . When her teeth decayed , they decayed . <p> - You think she 'll be much longer ? <p> I did n't know if Karen was washing things out or about to step in the shower or thinking over our supply of Band-Aids . The FBI looked at the way my hands trembled . <p> -I might get a bonus for suggesting new wetsuit colors . The trick is to find the ones that the sharks do n't associate with food , I said . <p> The informal interview was conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch next to her and take notes . She handed me a tablet and matching pen with a feather on top that waved about as I wrote . I realized that I was going to be late for work . <p> Cyril crossed one leg over the other , hiked his pant leg up , and settled into the chair we had picked up at the thrift store only the week before . <p> Jerry said this was just a chance to talk . He generously recapped events : The theft occurred at Karen 's bank in downtown Santa Cruz , four days earlier , at closing time . The doors were locked , and the last customers were being let out , a young girl was still there with her mother , depositing her savings . <p> Two thousand dollars was stolen from Arlene 's station . Arlene did the merchant money . She had been counting up but stepped away to get a slice of birthday cake from the operations officer 's desk . Ten seconds , she said , that 's all it took to grab a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return to her station . She never took her eyes off her cash drawer . <p> - Debbie 's birthday . Write that down , Karen said to me . <p> Cyril played with his lower lip . <p> - Do you have any idea who took the money ? <p> I was surprised Karen had n't dressed for the bank yet . She was wearing her yoga pants . She kept looking at Cyril . <p> - Maybe you have a suspicion ? <p> He considered her breasts for an answer , I believe . <p> - Write down suspicion , she said . <p> I did n't know if Cyril was her type . He was n't werewolf enough . But you ca n't always be predictable . <p> -I do n't think that's- Jerry started . <p> Cyril cut him off : - We only have one more question , he said . <p> Jerry looked at the floor . No one felt sorry for Jerry . <p> - We can handle one more question , Karen said . <p> - Of all the people who could have taken the money , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said . <p> Karen was a number of things you could slip into plastic bags with sterile gloves for future investigation . <p> Cyril pulled at the dark chest hairs that shot up over his tie , wrote his phone number on a card , and handed it to Karen . <p> -I would n't exactly call this living , she said . <p> Cyril came back around ten that night , and they danced in the living room . He wore the same suit he had on in the morning , but I think he had changed his shirt . They pushed the coffee table across the floor and left shallow gouges in the linoleum . If you lay on your belly and looked across the floor in the sunlight , the room was covered in tracks . Karen turned on the hanging paper lantern with the red light bulb . I kept my door cracked open like I needed light or air , wind velocity . <p> Cyril did things to Karen that I personally found amazing , but I could n't tell if she realized what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became abstract like wax apples mistaken for food . I got no pleasure from watching Karen sweat red . And I could n't use the bathroom without bothering them . I crawled out my bedroom window and landed on the spot where the last tenants had kept a kiddy pool for their ducks . A whole circle of grass destroyed . <p> I peed in the bushes and walked down to the pound , barefoot . <p> There was razor wire at the top of the outer chain link , a warning about the risks of electricity . The dogs barked and whined as I considered rescue . I did n't really believe they 'd keep the voltage high enough to kill me , when they were so busy killing those dogs , but I let it go . <p> I blew off my job a second day in a row and drove Elvis down to the town of Capitola . I found a place to park by a cliff overlooking a cluster of seaside homes . The shopping was n't great there , but you could buy stuff . Varnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of windsocks . As I was loading up Elvis , one of them got away from me . It climbed on a draft for a second and then landed next to a woman sunning in her backyard . She was belly-down on her towel . I watched her pull herself up onto her elbows , glance at the bright nylon fabric , and lay down again . <p> Obviously she was n't the type to care about the things that blew in . That was my mother , boy : she traveled over platelets , crags , land masses with nothing on her feet , did n't say a word . <p> The glue was n't all bad . It gave me moments of heightened awareness . So it was no big surprise when I got home and found Karen 's room torn up , my room torn up , all my potholders thrown around the kitchen . <p> - Jesus , thank God you 're home , she laughed . <p> I dumped the first load of packages into the easy chair , a silk kimono slid to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box . <p> - Wait , I said and rushed outside to retrieve more from Elvis . <p> She met me in the driveway . I handed her the leash . The dog sat in the driver 's seat , unwilling to move . <p> - She 's part poodle . And she 's quiet . <p> Karen made no effort to coax the wiry dog out of the car or drop the leash . But I could tell she got the full enterprise quickly : the back seat , the bed of the wagon-the glut . <p> - They told me at the pound she was going to be put to sleep today . <p> - That was my honeymoon money , she said . <p> - You 're getting married ? <p> - Does it matter now ? <p> I knew she was just saying this . We 'd never see Cyril again . <p> - But . . . <p> She yanked the dog from the car . It followed her inside , and she slammed the front door shut . <p> Karen could n't hold a bad mood for long . Not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sucked on the empty hookah , let me bring the other things in from the car . <p> I told her I thought I was dying of inhalation exposure and had decided to see a doctor . I 'd make an appointment with Legal Aid . I would give her all of my disability checks . <p> She took one of the new silk blouses from the pile and put it in the basin to soak . <p> - Maybe it was fate , she said . <p> She shook her wet hands in the air . Drops hit my face . <p> I fed the dog . Then she quickly found Karen 's feet , sniffed her toenails , and shut her eyes . Karen sat pinned on the couch next to me . <p> - Look at her . She 's remarkable . <p> We both looked at the dog . <p> Karen slumped against me . I thought I could smell soap residue on her hands . I felt the jerky resist as she nodded off to sleep . If lightning struck our duplex , I could have flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
