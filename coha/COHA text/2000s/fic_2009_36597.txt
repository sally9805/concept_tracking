Live in Seattle and you learn to layer . I was locked into the first-class can , hurling through the night , thirty thousand feet above Oregon 's sleepy charms , struggling to peel off my clothes before spontaneously combusting and turning Alaska Flight 291 into a fiery ball with no direction home . Really , they should n't let me through security . If hot flashes were detectable to scanners , a whole demographic , the one that kept Matlock on the air for so long , would be grounded for their own safety and the safety of others . <br> Locking my knees and bracing my hands against the bulkheads , I gave a fleeting moment 's thought to all those nameless , shameless shaggers who have at times partied in similar spaces and then bragged to their friends about it . Even in the days when I was having sex I wanted it on silk sheets , with some scented candles about , not in a public crapper the size of an upright coffin . <br> At last I got down to my bra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be honest with you , the amount of perspiration pumping out of me would have left space in a thimble for my old lieutenant 's heart , but it felt like Niagara . I held a handful of paper towels under the faucet , hammering it with my other hand to keep the water flowing . I ran the wet towels over my face and torso and under my arms . I looked at my reflection in the mirror and saw my hair uncurling . I took three deep breaths , and then I took three more . If I had a happy place , I would have gone to it . <br> In any case , my flamethrowers backed down and reset to safety . Crisis passed . Quinn has once again been defused . We will survive . <br> And then  --  how startling and wonderful  --  a blip broke the flat line that was the sexual me . A twinge . An echo of a feeling long , long forgotten , and I knew why : that man . That man sitting next to me in the first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and had a serious look at myself . Did I need this ? For sure , not . So why did I have this half a fantasy of dragging him in with me and doing the Mile High thing ? Oh , what a feeling ! Was I ready for the club ? <br> I youksed the door , fighting a small panic of entrapment , before I figured out to accordion the thing and managed to set myself free . <br> The stewardess , not much younger than I , and maybe a kindred spirit , offered me another Corona . I jumped on it . <br> I sat down again , next to that man and the slight odor of cloves . We smiled at each other . And , lo , in Little Sahara , falls a dewdrop . <br> " Here 's to it , " he said , and tapped his scotch against my beer . " Drinking in the sky . " <br> When we landed in Seattle , my head was on his shoulder , and I was fast asleep . <br> <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean I prefer trains , boats , or buses . I do n't like to travel , period . As the Zen Buddhists say , why go to distant lands when you have a perfectly good place to sit at home ? <br> Most of us , though , are obliged to do more than sit , and so occasionally even I have to dangle in the air . <br> First class makes a difference . I 'd never flown first class before , but then I 'd never flown on anybody else 's dime before , either . I was not used to being treated that way , not as a cop , not as a PI , not as a woman . <br> Early that morning a limo had picked me up at my apartment down in Pioneer Square . It was one of those days when the weight of the cold gray northern sky made it tough even to push open the front door . <br> The car was waiting for me on Yesler . I tried to get inside without my three Indians noticing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it got for them  --  under the pergola across the street . Drunk as they always were , they never missed much of what was happening . <br> Clifford Everybodytalksabout got to his feet fairly fast and shouted out , " Yo , Quinn , livin ' large , baby ! " <br> The other two struggled to get off the bench , using each other for leverage . The singer , David Hidesbehindthesmoke , yelled , " Paris Hilton ! It 's Paris Hilton ! " <br> " Fuck you , " I yelled back pleasantly . " Can I drop you somewhere ? Like down a hole ? " <br> They did n't need a second invitation . They staggered across James and Yesler where the streets come together , just managing not to get killed by traffic . I took them to Muscatel Meadows . <br> " Where 're you goin ' , Quinn ? " <br> " I 'm going to Hollywood , baby ! " I said , sounding like one of those American Idol hopefuls , but in my case the enthusiasm ran false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a cleared desk and I did n't want my bank account to resemble it . <br> I gave them a ten . They left a pungency behind , and although the driver was cool about it I could tell he saw this as the start of a bad day . Suffer . <br> So there I was , flying first class , compliments of a heavy-hitting screenwriter with the unfortunate name of Alex Krapp . Later , nearing what I thought was the end of my day with him , after a nice dinner at the Ivy and a bottle of chardonnay , I asked him why , since he was in show business , he had n't changed his name . He told me he had , and some of the expensive wine flew out of my nose . " You chose Alex Krapp ! " <br> He smiled sheepishly . " I know . " <br> " Nothing wrong with it , but . . . " <br> Continues ...                  @ @ @
