<p> The banks of a waterway described as " Atlanta 's drainage ditch " could become one of Georgia 's premier recreation areas . <p> A 98-mile trail system proposed for the Chattahoochee River south of Atlanta would connect four counties , two state parks , several private attractions , and existing and future population centers . <p> Carroll , Coweta and Douglas counties have all signed off on the master plan prepared by the PATH Foundation , a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing a metrowide trail system . <p> The Fulton County Commission will vote on the proposal early next year . <p> If the plan is approved , the governments can seek public and private money . The trail would be built in segments as funds become available . Landowners would have to agree to donate or sell rights of way where the trail crosses private land . <p> The entire system could take an estimated 10 years to finish . The projected $26 million cost includes building paths , pedestrian bridges and culverts , and acquiring right of way , according to PATH research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an organization of landowners in south Fulton , envision the river trail as a destination for metro residents who do n't want to make a long drive to the mountains or the coast . <p> The counties each chipped in $20,000 to fund PATH 's research . PATH has helped create the Silver Comet Trail , the Chastain Park Trail and the Freedom Park Trail . <p> The Southside trail would begin near Camp Creek Parkway in south Fulton and follow the river to the planned Chattahoochee Bend State Park in Coweta County . <p> Along the way , part of the trail would branch east to the 40,000-acre Chattahoochee Hill Country development site , where three " villages " could be built , each with up to 20,000 residents . <p> The path then would continue south to the city of Palmetto . Just above Palmetto , another leg of the trail would follow Cedar Creek west to the river . <p> Area ' written off ' <p> The trail plan was hatched during Chattahoochee Hill Country meetings , when leaders of the alliance discussed linking the development to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by special zoning , call for clustering homes and retail stores to preserve open space and provide interconnectivity . <p> " You ca n't just design the villages in isolation , " says Stacy Patton , Chattahoochee Hill Country president . " We 've been trying to work on a regional level . We do n't believe in government boundaries . " <p> Sally Bethea , executive director of the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper , says the area where the trail is planned " is my favorite part of the river , no doubt . " It 's fairly wide , with shoals and islands , and the shoreline is undeveloped and forested . <p> " That area for many years was written off , ignored , looked at as Atlanta 's drainage ditch , " Bethea says . Runoff from Atlanta development turns the river brick red on rainy days . The city 's sewage overflow sometimes fouls the water . And trash catches on the banks or floats to points south . <p> Atlanta is under federal court order to revamp its sewer system and stop polluting the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how to do that . Franklin proposed spending $3.2 billion , but the council passed a cheaper plan , which the mayor then vetoed . <p> Bethea says the trail would hasten the Chattahoochee 's recovery by raising its profile . " What people know , they want to protect , " she says . <p> Carroll County Commission Chairman Bob Barr agrees . He says the trail plan " seems like an excellent way to bring attention to an abandoned river . " <p> " I kayaked it as a high school student , and the only wildlife I saw were the leeches on my paddle , " Barr says of the river 's degraded condition . <p> Unlike the paved Silver Comet Trail , which uses an abandoned rail corridor that runs from Cobb County to Alabama , the Southside trail would be mostly unpaved , following old walkways , roads and utility easements . <p> " Depending on usage and locale , the trails will resemble narrow farm roads and cow paths , " the PATH report says . They " should be built to blend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Ferries considered <p> The master plan also calls for constructing several pedestrian bridges over the river and possibly starting ferry service at two locations to " provide a dose of Huck Finn to the Hill Country trail experience , " PATH says . <p> The ferries could be operated by volunteers or retirees , who would charge a toll to make the service self-sustaining . <p> Attractions along the trail network would be numerous , including the public Sweetwater Creek State Park in Lithia Springs , Cochran Mill Park and Nature Center in south Fulton , and the McIntosh Reserve in Carroll County . <p> Wilkerson Mill Garden , a nursery in Palmetto ; Dunaway Gardens near Newnan ; and Historic Banning Mills , an inn and executive retreat in Whitesburg , are among the private points of interest . <p> Near Banning Mills , hikers would see mill ruins and a gorge in an area that looks mountainous . " It 's good ecotourism for Carroll County , " says Donna Holder , who with husband Mike owns the inn .

Tourism 's growth goes hand in hand with the swelling ranks of baby boomers reaching retirement age . The number of Georgians 65 or older is expected to increase 38 percent from 2005 to 2015 , according to AARP . <p> " A lot of retirees with more leisure time are looking for nature , history and exercise , " Harrill says . <p> The Hill Country alliance and the institute plan to seek grant money to fund a study of the potential economic impact of constructing the trail . <p> " There 's a growing position in the development community that trails and connection to open space helps sell quality of life , which in turn sells houses , " says Kevin Johnson of the Georgia branch of the Trust for Public Land . <p> Rockmart sees gains <p> Explosive growth of rail trails , such as the Silver Comet Trail , demonstrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . <p> The Rails-to-Trails Conservancy estimates there are 12,500 miles of rail trails across the country . Countless more miles of trails have been created using easements , abandoned roads and undeveloped land . <p> Rockmart Mayor Curtis Lewis knows full well the economic benefits of a trail . The Silver Comet runs through his Paulding County town . " Folks I never dreamed would ride a bicycle are riding a bicycle , " Lewis says . And they 're spending money . <p> A study of a 72-mile , four-county trail in Ohio showed that each user spends $13.54 on food , beverage and gasoline . In addition , those individuals spend $277 a year on clothing , equipment and accessories . <p> In Rockmart , a family from South Carolina stayed a week just to use the trail and spent generously at the Silver Comet Depot , a bicycle and sandwich shop that opened because of the trail , Lewis says . <p> Shop manager Clark Dean says he 's had customers from as far away as New Zealand who had learned about the trail on the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail would link Palmetto and Cochran Mill Nature Center , a three-mile route proposed along Little Bear Creek .

And it 's an incredible thing in England to be able to go out in the countryside and pick up a path and walk from village to village , " Dean says . <p> " There 's a growing position in the development community that trails and connection to open space helps sell quality of life , which in turn sells houses .
