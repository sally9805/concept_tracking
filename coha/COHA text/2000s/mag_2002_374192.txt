The scourge that 's plaguing cruise lines  --  and causing thousands of Americans to rethink their holiday travel plans  --  did n't start this year , nor did it even start on a ship . It began , as far as the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) can tell , in Norwalk , Ohio , in October 1968 , when 116 elementary-school children and teachers suddenly became ill . The CDC investigated , and the culprit was discovered to be a small , spherical , previously unclassified virus that scientists named , appropriately enough , the Norwalk virus . <P> Flash forward 34 years , and Norwalk-like viruses ( there 's a whole family of them ) are all over the news as one ocean liner after another limps into port with passengers complaining of nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and cramping . The CDC , which gets called in whenever more than 2% of a vessel 's passengers come down with the same disease , identified Norwalk as the infectious agent and oversaw thorough ship scrubbings  --  which , to the dismay of the owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away . <P> So are we in the middle of an oceangoing epidemic ? Not according to Dave Forney , chief of the CDC 's vessel-sanitation program . He sees this kind of thing all the time ; a similar outbreak on several ships in Alaska last summer got almost no press . In fact , he says , as far as gastrointestinal illness goes , fewer people may be getting sick this year than last . <P> Norwalk-like viruses , it turns out , are extremely common  --  perhaps second only to cold viruses  --  and they tend to break out whenever people congregate in close quarters for more than two or three days . Oceangoing pleasure ships provide excellent breeding grounds , but so do schools , hotels , camps , nursing homes and hospitals . " Whenever we look for this virus , " says Dr. Marc Widdowson , a CDC epidemiologist , " we find it . " Just last week 100 students ( of 500 ) at the Varsity Acres Elementary School in Calgary , Alta. , stayed home sick . School prank ? Hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean cruises are your idea of fun , do n't despair . This might even be a great time to go shopping for a bargain . The ships have been cleaned . The food and water have been examined and found virus free . According to the CDC , it was probably the passengers who brought the virus aboard . <P> Of course , if you are ill or recovering from a stomach bug , you might do everybody a favor and put off your travel until the infectious period has passed ( it can take a couple of weeks ) . To reduce your chances of getting sick , the best thing to do is wash your hands  --  frequently and thoroughly  --  and keep them out of your mouth . <P> One more thing : if , like me , you are prone to motion sickness , do n't forget to pack your Dramamine.  --  With reporting by A.
