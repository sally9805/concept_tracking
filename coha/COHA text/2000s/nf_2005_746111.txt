Section : BOOKS Authorities on the Revolutionary era say how the Founding Fathers became culture heroes <p> Big men demand big books , or so the doorstop proportions of recent Founding Father biographies suggest . Ron Chernow 's Alexander Hamilton , at 600 pages , weighs nearly three pounds . The evergreen David McCullough offers both a 736-page John Adams ( which hit the million-printing mark three months after its 2001 pub date ) and , this May , an epic 400-page 1776 . Print-run reports dazzle . Walter Isaacson 's 2003 Benjamin Franklin : An American Life has gone back to press seven times ; Joseph Ellis 's His Excellency , George Washington ( 2004 ) scored an initial printing of 360,000 . With every publishing season , Founding-Father reputations sink and soar  --  Jefferson down , Patrick Henry up , Elbridge Gerry unchanged . <p> Founding Fathers is a 20th-century invention , a term that surfaced in the years before World War I , like hep and buzz off . Founding Mothers waited for attention until the 1970s ; ever since , women , Native Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolutionary history , demanding speaking parts . How do we explain this recent cresting of Founder fashion ? Newsweek christened the big-book trend " Founders chic . " Franklin biographer H. W. Brands argued in The Atlantic that the greatness-studies industry is a clear mistake ; the Founders were far bolder than we , he notes , but not all that much smarter , since they handed us a slave democracy whose reformation required 80 years and 600,000 lives . " In making giants of the founders , we make pygmies of ourselves .... The last thing they intended their revolution to produce was a new orthodoxy . " Maybe we should just think of first-rank Founders as the Beatles , suggests author and journalist Joel Achenbach , who examines Washington 's dreams of a western empire in The Grand Idea ( 2004 ) . Jefferson as Paul . Hamilton as John . Madison as George . Franklin ? Ringo . ( " Washington is Elvis . " ) <p> Whose Revolution is it anyway ? Both journalists and academics often bypass some of the liveliest popular renditions , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all . Yet every weekend , the Founding era calls forth Hessian units , British mounted dragoons , Abenaki villagers , and Continental marines . These living historians , fanatics for authenticity , plan to outdo themselves with elaborate re-creations in 2005 , which is the 230th anniversary of the battle at Lexington , and 225th of the battle of Charleston . Founder merchandise abounds . You can buy Founding Father coasters and magnets at Philadelphia 's new National Constitution Center , dogwood potpourri and toile wine bags from the Monticello mail-order catalogue , and soon you 'll be able to visit an $85 million Mount Vernon visitor center , where the plan is to market Washington as dreamboat and swashbuckler via a 15-minute feature film produced by Steven Spielberg . <p> If market penetration equals public education , then the two most influential strains of Founder fashion may be ( a ) the heavily promoted trade bestsellers , from Ellis to McCullough to Jon Stewart 's scathing America : ( The Book ) ; and ( b ) the movies . The Last of the Mohicans ( 1992 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Paramount has optioned Washington 's Crossing , the 2004 bestseller by David Hackett Fischer on the battles of Trenton and Princeton . The ambitious 2176 , a sci-fi retelling of the Revolution set in a distant star colony , will appear in 2006 . ( More than 30 million Williamsburg visitors have already seen The Story of a Patriot , a 1957 Vista Vision effort so stirring that it makes you want to rush out and scalp Tony Blair . ) <p> Pundits and politicians have their own uses for RevWar . The Founders ' views on who gets to participate still haunt our electoral politics , vide Hillary , Arnold , and Obama , all poised for election year 2008 and beyond , all conspicuously disqualified in the eyes of Washington , Adams , and Jefferson . If the Civil War 's battle cry of freedom ( for absolutely everybody ) is a liberal favorite , then the Revolution 's inalienable rights ( to lots and lots of property and profit ) clearly thrill conservatives , whether moderate , neo- , or paleo- . One might expect a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Inauguration Day 2005 , Comedy Central 's Daily Show counted references and reported that in the Bush address freedom ( 27 ) beat liberty ( 15 ) by almost two touchdowns . <p> But the historians ' Revolution leads all the test . Thanks to the National Endowment for the Humanities and to tax funding by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission , the great archival marathons have advanced , from the Franklin Papers at Yale and the Jefferson Papers at Princeton to the documents of constitutional ratification at the University of Wisconsin . In material culture studies , science and sympathy can now tease apart two centuries of paint jobs , almost molecule by molecule , and tell us not only that the Washingtons picked a truly bilious green for Mount Vernon 's dining room , but why . ( The color was thought to aid digestion . ) Without professional time-travelers  --  in museums and conservation labs , in departments of history and political science , and in schools of law  --  there would be no ferment and fizz , nothing new to popularize , no supersized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SCHOLAR asked some distinguished American authorities on the period to comment on reasons for the persistence of Founders chic . JAN LEWIS , Rutgers-Newark <p> American identity is very much connected to the era of the Revolution . Being French antedates the French Revolution and is independent of it . Ditto for Russians . The English Revolution plays almost no role in English consciousness . But the United States was created , literally , by the Revolution , and that era is the touchstone for American identity . I think that Americans look to the Founders and their era for stability in times of change ( and all periods are times of change ) . It began early on . Take Lincoln 's Lyceum Speech . Are we as great as the men who created our nation ? Etc . Today , the intense interest in the Founding Fathers seems to be a kind of hero worship , or perhaps a longing for romantic heroes  --  men who had the power to shape their world . I once wrote ( approximately ) that people bring to the Founding Fathers all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , projecting onto them a longing for greatness , a grandiosity ; imagining ourselves ( especially if we are white guys ) as powerful giants , creating a whole country out of our own intelligence and will . GORDON WOOD , Brown <p> I do have some hunches , based on questions I get when I give a lecture on the Founders to general audiences . Our jurisprudence keeps the Constitution front and center in our lives . But this hardly explains why so many ordinary folk want to know about the Founders . I think that , especially in times of concern and anxiety like the present , we tend to look back to the Founding for solace and guidance . I have had lots of people ask me : What would Jefferson or Washington think of some current event , such as our invasion of Iraq ? Then , also , many people want to contrast our present-day politicians with the Founders . Why ca n't we have leaders like them today ? they ask . So the Founders become a gold standard against which we measure our current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very different and much more democratic age . ROBERT GEORGE , Princeton <p> The country is moving ( in fits and starts and with some inconsistencies ) in a conservative direction and has been since the late 1970s . One facet of this phenomenon ( which has many dimensions ) is the revival and intensification of interest in our past , particularly in the principles of our nation 's founding and the character of the Founders . If the spirit of the 1960s and early 1970s was one of " liberation " from traditional norms of conduct , and social " transformation " ( " revolution " ) with a view to constructing a new society , free of the injustices of the past , the contemporary spirit is one that seeks recovery of what was wise and valuable . The premise , of course , is that wise and valuable things have been lost , perhaps because we mindlessly abandoned them while intoxicated by the wine of personal liberation and social transformation . <p> All of this was true even on September 10 , 2001 . What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to ask " Who are we ? " " What do we stand for ? " " Where did we come from ? " After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , the James Madison Program here at Princeton sponsored a panel discussion titled " What does it mean to be an American ? " Students packed the house . We had asked the right question  --  a question more fundamental than " Why do they hate us ? " ( Indeed , the latter question can only be intelligently explored on the basis of some understanding of the answer to the former . ) I think that this is the question in people 's minds when they purchase , for example , McCullough 's excellent biography of Adams , or Wood 's splendid biography of Franklin . These are not debunking books ; nor are readers in a debunking mood . It is equally important to observe that they are not nostalgic books ; for readers today are not in the mood for nostalgia , either . These are serious books about serious men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as McCullough and Wood approach their subjects in that spirit , and the payoff for readers  --  who , after September 11 , but even before , are in a mood for serious reflection  --  is huge . LOUIS MASUR , Trinity College <p> The current cycle of fascination with the Founders seems to date to the 1990s . The books that have emerged in the past months are products of a renewed interest that can be traced to Ellis 's American Sphinx . And his continued success ( Founding Brothers and His Excellency ) is due in part to his elegance as a writer . Indeed , many of the recent books about the Founders are noteworthy as works that revive a sense of history as literature : Edmund Morgan 's Ben Franklin , McCullough 's John Adams , Chernow 's Alexander Hamilton are all beautifully written . The interest in biography and history as a literary art marks a turn away from the social history of the 1970s and 1980s . History from the bottom up , history of the so-called inarticulate , revolutionized our understanding of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look very different without the work that came before , as An Imperfect God , Henry Wiencek 's recent biography of Washington , demonstrates . But much of that social history abjured story-telling , whereas narrative is the essence of biography . <p> Of course , the renewed interest in the Founders can not be explained simply by the cycles of historical writing and interest . Americans are engaged by politics and political leaders in ways that they have n't been in some time . The charisma of Bill Clinton no doubt helped refocus attention on the dynamic personalities of the Founders , and the events of the past four years have placed leadership at the forefront of all political discussions . Finally , it is important to note that the vitality of Founders studies is not limited to lyrical biographies , and neither is the audience . Jon Stewart 's mega-best-selling America takes the form of a history textbook , and it includes a " foreword by Thomas Jefferson " that is scandalous and hilarious . PAULINE MAIER , MIT <p> Why do people want to read these books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although I do n't think it 's his alone . Essentially he says that at the present time , when the country and its traditions are going to hell in a handcart , people like to look back at a time when , for once , the country 's leaders seemed to be doing things right . That could be part of the reason , but this is n't the only time the country seemed to be in trouble , and the other times were not , I think , accompanied by a surge of interest in the Founders . Moreover , the last election suggests that a good many Americans are not unhappy with the course the nation has taken . Could it be that all the readers of these books are in " blue " states , or " blue " people in " red " states ? I do n't think so . <p> Then there 's a theory someone offered after hearing my lecture on this subject . The wonderful thing about these books , he said , is that they tell stories . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked students to discuss the issues under debate . That , he said , was boring , but stories pull readers in . Some academics disdain that kind of reaction , but we 've thought so much about narrative that the position commands , I think , some respect . Human beings understand themselves and their world by constructing narratives ; narrative is a natural human literary form . And the popular writers of the past few years  --  particularly the most successful  --  have been telling stories and , in the case of Founding Brothers , analyzing them in ways that reveal how much reading history has in common with reading detective novels . Of course , history has one advantage over mystery or detective novels : it actually happened . That adds to its interest . <p> So , with the proviso that there probably is no definitive answer to the question , I suspect the reason for the current interest in the Founders lies in the ready availability of sources  --  particularly the modern editions of the papers of the Founders , which provide a massive amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wrote good narratives , which attracted lots of readers , whose patronage increased sales and royalties , which attracted more writers able to make history as interesting as it is and ought to be . ALAN TAYLOR , University of California at Davis <p> The Founders are compelling personalities , and in that we are fortunate . They remain our touchstone , our way of understanding what we take to be the core values of the Republic . People of different political persuasions look , naturally , at different aspects . Hamilton is a favorite of fans of a muscular state ; Jefferson appeals to fans of civil liberties and states ' rights . Where might this phenomenon go ? Probably it 's self-limiting , or so I thought before the fifth Franklin biography made an appearance . I ca n't imagine such a surge will keep going at this pace . David McCullough has become a brand name , a franchise . JILL LEPORE , Harvard <p> I have n't seen a huge rise in adoration and celebration . Interest , yes , but Founder mania is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times list of Best Books of 2004 , and there are McCullough and Chernow , so who knows ? In the era of The History Channel  --  consider ads for the Ben Franklin series , " Playboy , statesman , spy "  --  there has been a proliferation of outlets for popular history . But a certain edginess has crept in because of the prominence of the discussion of slavery . Academics have been discussing the paradox of freedom and slavery in the Founding era for a good three decades and , by now , popular writers by necessity deal more with it , too . It 's also worth noting that the news cycle concerning Jefferson 's DNA came at around the same moment as the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal . In a weird way , maybe the personal failings of Bill Clinton have made it possible to write more complex histories of Jefferson and of all of his founding brothers . JACK RAKOVE , Stanford <p> How to account for the astonishing ongoing popularity of Founders chic ? One answer is obvious . There is a flourishing market that publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the public is sated and the bubble bursts . But anyone can reach that conclusion . Two deeper explanations are worth exploring . <p> First , the Revolution remains a source of national unity in a way , one fears , that the Civil War , with its mass slaughter and the ultimate failure of Reconstruction , does not . Arguably it should be the other way around , because the Civil War resolved the issues the Revolution left open . But alas , some of those issues vex us still . <p> A second answer requires accepting another obvious fact and then posing one further question . When all is said and done , this was a truly remarkable group of leaders , both for their collective abilities , and for the differences of character , temperament , and intellect that distinguish them from each other . What remains puzzling  --  and what none of the recent practitioners of Founders chic adequately confronts  --  is a simple question : How did these placid backwater provinces in North America manage to produce this array of talent ? The question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned these men onto a public stage , with lasting consequences for us all . <p> Each Founder contains multitudes : Adams the sexist conservative and Adams the admiring consort of Abigail , Franklin the buoyant genius and Franklin the slave trader . Every generation finds the faces it needs . In tracking the secret springs of Founder fashion , we might try looking further back , at Bartholomew Gosnold , the country 's very first English settler , or at figures that the Revolutionary generation would have considered Founders , like John Winthrop . A glance sideways ( as Alan Taylor suggests in his forthcoming book , The Divided Ground ) reveals our anti-Founding Fathers , like the British-educated Mohawk leader Joseph Brant , who wanted native peoples to be landlords and managers of their own lands . Luckily , Revolutionary research , like the era itself , remains complex , nuanced , and unresolved . The great tonic chords of politics , constitutional interpretation , and war remain , but to throw new light on the conflict , historians are trying everything from salt to smallpox ; both armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variola epidemics of 1775-82 helped form military strategy . <p> Princeton historian Sean Wilentz notes that we live in a golden age of historical popularization . But do we buy the doorstop volumes to read or to display ? During the last presidential campaign , Barnes &; Noble booksellers , at least , discovered that many customers expressly craved political titles as cultural shorthand on the coffee table , intellectual bumper stickers . As we the people continue to wrestle with the Founding legacy , it 's worth remembering that one American in three still lives in the original 13 colonies . Same old , same old . Mr. Jefferson would be shocked , and Mr. Washington too . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Anne Matthews <p> <p> Anne Matthews is working on Indivisible , a book about eight couples  --  American , French , German , and Native American who helped shape the Revolution . <p>
