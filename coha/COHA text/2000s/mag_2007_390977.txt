Abusive coaches . Burned-out players . Rising injury rates . Here 's how to protect your child from the new risks of playing sports This is way too intense , Kathie Smith remembers thinking last fall when she heard about her son 's football schedule . " Games on Saturdays , two-hour practices every weeknight  --  there was no time for homework or family , " says Smith , 37 , of Woolwich Township , NJ . " I worried even more that it was too much for his body . Drew was only 7 . " Smith grew up in a football family ; her grandfather , John Lookabaugh , played for the NFL . " We 're not quitters , " she says , " but I was relieved and even proud when Drew decided to drop out after just a week . The coaches ' mentality was way too aggressive . Sports should be fun . Now Drew plays baseball and soccer and loves them  --  no stress . " You 've heard about the problems plaguing kids ' sports these days , from trash-talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder that the 2005 Youth Sports National Report Card , issued by a coalition of amateur and professional sports groups , handed out some near-failing grades to the nation 's community-based youth sports programs for kids ages 6 to 14 . The good news : It does n't have to be that way . " Playing sports can still be a great experience for kids , " says Brooke de Lench , author of Home Team Advantage : The Critical Role of Mothers in Youth Sports . " They develop physical skills , get a good workout , become team players , learn how to win and lose . Parents can keep kids out of the crazy vortex of overly competitive and hyperintense sports experiences if they know what to expect . " We asked De Lench  --  founder of MomsTeam.com , an online resource for parents interested in keeping youth athletics safe and sane  --  and other parents and experts how they handle five common sports pitfalls . Pitfall The sport 's too time-consuming , physically demanding , or competitive . Solution Say no  --  and seek a kinder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rinehart of Baldwin City , KS , loved weekly practices for her town 's recreational gymnastics program . At 10 , she was thrilled when a competitive team invited her to join . But it meant three or four practices a week plus weekend meets , so she said no . " I thought I 'd feel really pressured if I stayed in gymnastics , " says Aubrey , now 12 . " My brother was doing tae kwon do and it looked really fun , so I switched . " Her parents are glad . " It 's easy to feel flattered when your child is asked to join a team , " says her mom , Nancy Crisp , 45 . " But she would n't have had time for a life . " Aubrey now happily practices a form of tae kwon do that mixes the ancient martial art with modern gymnastics moves . " It 's really fun ! " she says . " My friends and I like it . " Aubrey 's a typical kid : When De Lench surveyed 5,000 parents about kids ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ages 4 to 19 , played for fun and friendship . " Winning was a low priority , " she says . " In fact , kids would rather play on a losing team than warm the bench on a winning one . " To keep your child active and interested in athletics , shop around for a low-stress version of a sport she likes ( the YMCA is often a good place to start ) . Hallmarks of a child-centered program : It has just one or two practices and one game per week for kids ages 5 to 9 ( more for tweens and teens ) , no tryouts or team cuts before age 14 , and a policy of equal playing time for every child , regardless of skill level . Before you sign up , ask the coach how much emphasis he or she puts on winning . If your child is unhappily stuck in a high-stress situation , De Lench advises , allow him or her to quit . " As adults , we walk away from situations that are n't good for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . " It also sends a message to the league or the team . " Pitfall Your child is pressured to specialize in a single sport . Solution Encourage old-fashioned seasonal sports . Once reserved for a few superstar kids in marquee sports like tennis and golf , year-round single-sport specialization has become common among children as young as 6 . " Some parents are pushing for a college athletic scholarship , " notes Dan Gould , Ph.D. , director of the Institute for the Study of Youth Sports at Michigan State University . " But usually , it 's a slippery slope that starts with a kid joining an elite team , then adding more and more training . " Alex Baddeley 's teammates gave her a hard time when she quit a top-tier soccer program three years ago because it conflicted with her school basketball schedule . " They were mad because they did n't think I was dedicated enough , " says 17-year-old Alex , who graduated in June from Petaluma High School in Petaluma , CA . " The coaches want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard to resist the push to specialize , but I 'm glad I did . Playing a variety of sports has taught me how to interact with all sorts of people . " There are other benefits , Gould says . " For optimal motor development , we want kids to work on a range of skills  --  jumping , running , throwing , and kicking . Soccer is good for lower-body coordination , for example , and baseball for eye-hand coordination . " Kids should sample a variety of sports until they 're in their tweens or even teens , in order to avoid burnout and overuse injuries  --  and so they 'll be able to make a more informed decision about concentrating on a single sport later . For kids who already specialize , parents can encourage breaks . " You might sign your daughter up for art camp instead of tennis camp , or encourage your son to play baseball instead of spring soccer , " suggests Lyle Micheli , M.D. , director of the Division of Sports Medicine at Children 's Hospital Boston . Pitfall Coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pains to take seriously . When 7-year-old Stephen Ayim of Coon Rapids , MN , convinced his gymnastics coach to let him try " giant swings " on the high bar last year , he tilted his head back too far and developed a whiplash-like neck injury . " At first it was just a little pain , " says his mom , Penny Ayim , 33 , " but a few weeks later , he could n't move his neck at all . A pediatric orthopedist told us he needed rest . With sports injuries , it 's tough for parents and even coaches to know if it 's just a sore muscle or something more serious . " Best rule of thumb : If your child complains for two or more weeks about any discomfort , get it checked out , Dr. Micheli says . " And if there 's any swelling or loss of motion , see a doctor right away . Some injuries that parents may have no experience with could cause permanent damage , such as Little League Elbow , brought on by pitching too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal . " Pitfall Untrained coaches value winning more than fun . Solution Check priorities  --  and lobby for mandatory training . " Recreational sports could n't exist without volunteer coaches , " says Fred Engh , founder and president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports ( nays.org ) , based in West Palm Beach , FL , and author of Why Johnny Hates Sports . " But when fathers or mothers are recruited to coach and have no idea what it 's all about , it 's easy for them to mirror the values and structure of pro sports . The emphasis becomes scores , standings , championships , even playing through pain after an injury . " The antidote is a training class for coaches ( NAYS offers one ) that stresses the importance of fun , fitness , character building , and skill development over winning . Like thousands of communities across the nation , Falmouth , ME , began requiring coach training six years ago for all leagues using town facilities . " I feel things are friendlier out there on the field now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities scheduler . " More kids are staying in organized sports here than ever before . " In a new University of Washington study of two youth basketball leagues with players ages 10 to 14 , those whose coaches got training felt less anxious and defined success as doing their best ; kids with untrained coaches felt tenser as the season went on , and they defined success as winning games . And 26 percent of the players with untrained coaches quit during the season , compared to just 11 percent with trained coaches . If your league or town does n't have mandatory certification for coaches , Engh says , discuss the subject with local officials . In the meantime , before the first practice , talk with your child 's coach about what her goals are for the season , whether she supports equal playing time , how she feels about sportsmanship and injury prevention , and whether parental input is welcome . " Then show up at practices and games , " Engh says . " It 's the only way to really see what a coach is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Train them , too . They 're everywhere  --  from the Virginia mom who slapped and scratched a soccer ref 's face to the Louisiana dad who threatened to kill the umpire at his 7-year-old son 's baseball game . In a recent Sporting Kid magazine survey of more than 3,300 parents , coaches , and youth sports administrators , 84 percent said they 'd seen parents at games and practices shouting , berating kids , and using abusive language . If other parents are creating a negative atmosphere , do n't confront them yourself . Instead , talk to the coach or a league administrator about setting up parent sportsmanship training classes ( NAYS has developed one ) , now mandatory in many towns and leagues across the nation . For example , at St. Andrew 's Parish Parks &; Playground , a public recreational agency in Charleston , SC , before kids can play on a team , their parents are required to take a brief , free class and sign a code of ethics . Getting too wound up yourself at games and practices ? Step away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the players . " It 's important to keep up a positive presence on the sidelines , " De Lench says . " Your child wants to know you 're there to cheer her on regardless of who 's winning . " Take the same approach at home . " It 's up to coaches to work on skills and strategy , " she says . " Your job is to support your child by applauding his or her efforts . " 40% of all emergency room visits are for sports injuries in kids ages 5 to 14 <p>
