Northcliffe Hall August 15 , 1815 Tysen sherbrooke gazed out the wide windows onto the east lawn of Northcliffe , his brow furrowed thoughtfully . " As a matter of fact , " he said , " I did know that I was in line for the title , Douglas , but I was so far down on the list of rightful heirs that I never imagined it could actually happen . Indeed , I have n't even thought of it for a good decade . The last grandson , Ian , he 's really dead ? " " Yes , just six months before the old man died . It seems he fell off a cliff into the North Sea . The solicitor seems to think Ian 's death is what shoved Old Tyronne into the grave . Of course , he was eighty-seven , so he probably did n't need much of a push . That means that you , Tysen , are now Baron Barthwick . It 's an old barony , dating back to the early fifteenth century , when men of importance were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long time . " " I remember Kildrummy Castle , of course , " Tysen said . " It 's right on the coast , below Stonehaven , overlooking the North Sea . It 's a beautiful place , Douglas , not immensely tall with no windows like the old medieval Scottish castles , but newer , built in the late seventeenth century , I believe . I remember being told that the original castle was destroyed in one of their interminable clan fights . The new one , it 's got gables and chimney stacksa good dozen of themand four round angle-turrets . The lower floor of the castle is closed off by the building itself and attached to a curtain wall that encloses a very large inner courtyard . " Tysen paused a moment , seeingeverything from a younger perspective , and his eyes glistened a bit as he said , " Ah , but the countryside , Douglas , it is untamed and wild , as if God gazed down upon it , decided against our modern buildings and roads , and left it untouched . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deep-rutted paths , just one narrow , winding road , really , that leads to the castle . There 's a steep , rocky hill that goes down to a beach , and wildflowers , Douglas , wildflowers everywhere . " This was quite a poetic outpouring from his staid , very serious and literal brother . Douglas was pleased that Tysen not only remembered Barthwick so well but also appeared to admire it immensely . He said , " I remember your going there with Father when you werewhat ? About ten years old ? " " That 's right . It was one of the best times of my life . " Douglas was n't at all surprised . It was unusual that any of them had ever had their father completely to themselves . Whenever Douglas had his father 's full attention , he 'd felt blessed by the Almighty . He still missed the former earl , an honorable man who had loved his children and managed to tolerate his difficult wife with a wry smile and a shrug of his shoulders . Douglas sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holder of an ancient medieval barony , I suppose I shall have to let you sit above the salt . " Tysen did n't laugh , but perhaps he did smile , just a bit . He had n't laughed much since he 'd decided to become a man of God when he was seventeen . Douglas remembered their brother Ryder telling Tysen that of all the men placed on this benighted earth , it was a vicar who should have the greatest sense of humor , since God obviously did . Just look at all the absurdities that surrounded us . Had n't Tysen ever observed the mating ritual of peacocks , for example ? And just look at their buffoon of a prince regent , who was so fat he had to be hoisted in and out of his ; bathtub ? Ah , but Tysen was serious , his sermons high-minded , stark in their message that God was a stern taskmaster and not apt to easily overlook a man 's lapses . Tysen was now thirty-one years old . He certainly had the look of the Sherbrookestall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sherbrooke eyes the color of a summer sky , Douglas was the changeling , with his jet-black hair and dark eyes . But Tysen did n't have his siblings ' love of life , their seemingly inborn boundless joy , their belief that the world was a very fine place indeed . " Sitting above the saltI have n't heard that phrase in a very long time , " Tysen said . " I suppose I must travel to Scotland and see what 's what . " He sighed . " There is always so much that demands my time here , but Great Uncle Tyronne deserves an heir who will at least see that the estate is run properlynot that I have much experience in that area . " " You know I will assist you , Tysen . You need but ask . Would you like me to accompany you to Barthwick ? " Tysen shook Iris head . " No , Douglas , but I thank you . It is something that is my responsibility . I have an efficient curate who can assume my duties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Oh , yes , no way to forget that dour prig . Douglas merely nodded . " No , I will go by myself . All the heirs dead . Douglas , I remember all the cousins . So many boys . All of them are really dead ? " " Yes , a great shame . Disease , accidents , duels , a case of too much revelry . As I said , the last heir , Ian Barthwick , evidently fell off a cliff into the North Sea . The solicitor was n't specific about exactly how it happened . " " There must have been six boys to inherit , all of them before me . And that 's why , as I remember , Great Uncle Tyronne set me up as an heir . It amused him to see it done legallyto place an English boy in line for an ancient Scottish barony . Naturally he never expected that it would come about . " " And now it 's yours , Tysen . His jest came back to hit him in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep than you can count even when you 're trying to fall asleepall of it belongs to an Englishman . And many of the crofters and tenants are fishermen , so that means that even during bad times , no one starves . It is n't a wealthy holding , but it is substantial . I understand that Great Uncle Tyronne did n't believe in clearances . None of that has ever been done on Barthwick land . " " Good for him , " Tysen said . " It 's a pernicious practice , Douglas , dragging people off land that they 've farmed or raised sheep on for hundreds of years . " He paused a moment , then said , " I suppose that my son Max is now the heir to the Barony of Barthwick . I do wonder what he will have to say to that . " He would probably quote some Latin , Douglas thought . His brother 's elder boy was very intelligent , quiet , a scholar , perhaps even more serious than his father had been at his age . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the entire line of Sherbrookes , so far as Douglas knew . " When you leave , Tysen , bring the children here , and Alex and I will look after them . Your Meggie can whip not only her brothers into shape but her cousins as well . Heathens , the both of them . " Tysen did smile then , a slow , calm smile . " She is amazing , is n't she , Douglas ? " " Just like Sinjun at her age . Meggie will rule your household , Tysen , if you 're not careful . " Tysen looked appalled . " No , really , not at all like Sinjun , Douglas . Perhaps she looks like Sinjun , but a hoyden like Sinjun ? Oh , no . I remember Sinjun could drive you to Bedlam with her antics . Oh , no , Meggie is much more restrained , much more a little lady than Sinjun ever was . " Douglas said , " Do you remember how Father threw up his hands when Sinjun kicked Tommy Maitland in his backside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God he did n't break his neck . " Tysen said , " And that time ' she sewed all your trouser legs together ? I can still hear you yelling , Douglas . No , Meggie is n't like Sinjun was . She , s very obedient . I 've never had a day 's worry with her . " Suddenly a slight furrow appeared between his brows . " Well , perhaps she does have our two servants at her beck and call . Perhaps also the boys do obey her quickly , usually without fuss . Then there 's Cook , who actually bakes dishes just for Meggie . But it is her sweetness , her patience , that gains her the love and obedience of all those at the vicarage , even her brothers . " It was difficult to restrain himself , but Douglas did n't roll his eyes . Was his brother completely blind ? Evidently so . Meggie was careful around her father , the chit was that smart . He said , " I remember I boxed Sinjun 's ears so many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that once . As I remember , I was thirteen and she was nine and she had tied the tail of my favorite kite around Corkscrew 's neckyou remember Corkscrew , do n't you , Douglas ? What a dog ! He was the very best . In any case , then Sinjun throws a stick and off goes Corkscrew , and believe it or not , that kite lifted off the ground , before it got tangled up in one of Mother 's rosebushes and got mined . I smacked her before she managed to run and hide from me . " Then , very suddenly , Tysen managed a very big smile . " I had n't realizedI will see Sinjun and Colin . It 's been too long . " He rose and stretched . " Well , I suppose there is no time like the present . Samuel Pritchert will take good care of all our people . Thank you for taking the children , Douglas . I believe I will leave on Wednesday . I daresay I can write a good dozen sermons in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Meggie quickly ran down the long hallway when she heard her father moving toward the door of Uncle Douglas 's estate room . She ran right into her aunt Alex , " Goodness , Meggie , are you all right ? " Alex ' grasped her niece 's arms and eyed her closely . " You were listening , were n't you ? Oh dear , I did too at your age . Your aunt Sinjun still does . What is going on , Meggie ? " " Father is going to Scotland on Wednesday . He 's leaving the boys here . " Alex raised a brow . " Oh , yes , the new title . It 's right that he should go . And what about you ? " " Oh , " Meggie said , giving her aunt a very wicked smile . " I 'm going with him . He needs me , you know . " " You think he will take you ? " " Oh , yes , " Meggie said . " Is there anything I can do for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her niece and lightly touched her fingertips to her lovely hair . Tysen did n't have a chance , she thought . She sent Meggie up to the schoolroom to have luncheon with her brothers and cousins . They were evidently holding special races , using the tables and desks for obstacles , their tutor , Mr. Murphy , had told her as he 'd mopped the sweat off his brow . Alex knew that Meggie could bring them back to order . She was still smiling when Tysen and Douglas came out of the library . " Hollis just told me that luncheon is served , " she said . " Indeed , my lord , " Hollis said , giving Tysen a rare smile . " The title and dignities will suit you well . " " Thank you , Hollis . " Alex said , " Is the new and very worthy Baron Barthwick ready for some of Cook 's thin-sliced ham ? " " How very odd that sounds , " Tysen said thoughtfully , then he added in a very serious voice , " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alex . I am now that important . " She laughed , as did Douglas , but Tysen did n't . He merely acknowledged with a slight smile that he 'd said something that could be construed as moderately witty , then asked about his nephews ' health . " Their health is splendid , " Douglas said . " It 's their damned good looks that are driving me to the brink of madness . Both James and Jason will slay the women , Tysen . By God , they are only ten years oldthe same age as little Meggieand already all the local girls are showing up on our doorstep at all hours , presenting colorful bouquets of flowers wrapped up in pink ribbons for Alex , presenting me with homemade slippers , even plates of tarts that they claim they baked with their own small handsanything to bring themselves to the twins ' attention . Most of the time , they have no idea which twin is which , so you can imagine how many pranks the play on them . " Douglas shook his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys take it in stride , but it 's nonetheless nauseating and portends bad things for the future . " Tysen said as he seated himself at the small dining table , " I suppose they do greatly resemble your sister , Alex . " He added matter-of-factly , " It 's true that she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen . Is n't it strange that the twins should look so much like her and not like you or Douglas ? " " Tony , damn his eyes , just laughs and laughs whenever that is pointed out , " Douglas said and handed Tysen a plate of Cook 's famous thin-sliced ham , sprinkled with her renowned Secret Recipe that always had badly crushed basil leaves in it . " At least Tony and Melissande 's children look like we could be their parents , so that 's something . Now , Tysen , let me tell you the rest of what Great Uncle Tyronne 's solicitor wrote .
