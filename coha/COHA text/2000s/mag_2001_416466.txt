Lots of packages claim to keep your PC running trouble-free . Here 's the scoop on which ones really do the job . // ONCE UPON A TIME ( when PCs first got hard drives ) , people needed to be able to recover accidentally deleted files-so they bought programs like Norton Utilities . They also needed to scan their drives for errors and defragment their files . Today anyone can retrieve files from Windows ' Recycling Bin , and the operating system has its own disk maintenance tools ; increasingly , the features that used to require a separate program are being included in Windows . But companies continue to produce utilities , claiming that they are faster or better than the ones built into Windows . It 's a fact of modem life that computers have problems . Installing a new program can trash your operating system , and without regular maintenance the files on your hard drive can get so mixed up that they get strewn across it , slowing down saving and reading data . A good suite of utilities can diagnose and fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of your hard drive , and help you organize your files . Ineffective utilities can waste your time , and bad utilities can leave your computer in worse condition than before you installed them . To test the claims of utility suite vendors , we looked at four suites , each offering a somewhat different collection of tools : Iolo 's System Mechanic 3.6 , McAfee Utilities 4 , Ontrack 's SystemSuite 3 , and Symantec 's Norton SystemWorks 2001 Professional Edition . We skipped a fifth package , Ultra WinCleaner Utility Suite ( www.windeaner.com ) , because the new version was n't ready in time for our review ( it is scheduled for release in September ) . Since you may need functions that the utility suites do n't offer , we also looked at a selection of stand-alone utilities , including Smith Micro 's CheckIt Utilities , PowerQuest 's PartitionMagic , and Vcom 's DriveWorks . We put the suites and the stand-alone programs through five common tasks : diagnosing and fixing what 's wrong with your PC , taking care of your disks , managing your files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your system from external threats such as computer viruses . We recommend at least one package for most tasks , and when Windows ' own built-in utility is the best choice , we note that as well . Our conclusions are based on in-depth testing carried out by the PC World Test Center and our experience using the programs on a variety of PCs . Of the four major packages , Ontrack 's $50 System  --  Suite turned out to be the best choice in most categories , I was easy to use , and proved reliable . McAfee Utilities has more modest ambitions-most obviously , it lacks an antivirus program ( McAfee sells McAfee VirusScan separately for $30 ) . On the other hand , McAfee Utilities costs only about $30 and includes many of the features that most users will need . The name Norton has been synonymous with utilities for nearly two decades , so at first glance , Symantec 's Norton SystemWorks 2001 Professional Edition should be the leading program . SystemWorks 2001 Professional 's collection of tools would seem to be worth its $80 street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backup and fax components at a street price of $55 ) . But features are n't everything . Many of the Norton programs proved unreliable , with crashes and other odd behavior ; you can read more about one person 's experiences in " When Utilities Attack " on page 111 And some of the features of SystemWorks 2000-such as Registry Tracker and Norton Diagnostics-ca n't be used under Windows 2000. lolo 's System Mechanic is even more modest than McAfee , lacking not only an antivirus utility but also disk-care and system file backup features . Unfortunately , the $60 System Mechanic also lacks McAfee 's modest price . Ontrack 's SystemSuite 3 NO SUITE DOES everything , and what they do they do n't always do perfectly . But Ontrack 's $50 SystemSuite 3 came out on top in six of our categories and offers the best overall mixture of functionality , ease of use , dependability , and price . It 's the best suite of the bunch if you want to diagnose hardware problems or back up the Registry , thanks to its excellent diagnostics and maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you want to clean out your hard drive or tidy up the Registry . And the final touch is the bundled PowerDesk Pro , the file manager to beat all file managers . Keep Your // Sections // UTILITY SUITE // System Running MODERN COMPUTERS , operating systems , and programs are so complicated that they often crash , leaving a potentially damaged system and all sorts of rubbish lying around your hard drive . A good diagnostic program and Registry cleaner can do wonders in identifying problems on your system and making sure that everything is in working order . DIAGNOSTICS RECOMMENDED : Smith Micro 's CheckIt Utilities , Ontrack SystemSuite 3 , McAfee 4 Utilities THE FIRST THING you see when you load Symantec 's Norton SystemWorks or Ontrack 's SystemSuite is a one-click option to give your system a quick physical . Either of these checkups is worth doing , but neither should be your only diagnostic tool . SystemSuite 's PC Diagnostics offers the most thorough set of tests , allowing you to find problems in the hardware of your system ( such as a so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motors , as well as polygon drawing by the video card ) . Some of these tests take hours , and others require user interaction , so you need to carefully consider which ones you 'll run if you do n't just go with the defaults . However , the default settings should be adequate for most users . McAfee Utilities ' First Aid is n't as thorough as SystemSuite 's program , but it 's friendlier . In fact , it opens up with a nice drawing of a computer sitting on a desk . If you want to test , say , your video card and monitor , you dick on the monitor image . Norton SystemWorks Professional offers neither Ontrack SystemSuite 's extensive testing options nor McAfee 's visual panache , although it does have some basic diagnostic tools in the form of Norton Diagnostics . System Mechanic does n't include a diagnostic module . For a better hardware diagnostic program than those in any of the suites , consider Smith Micro 's $50 CheckIt Utilities ( www.checkit.com ) . As with SystemSuite , the tests are extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even keep a history of your hardware configuration and benchmark results . Then , after you 've fiddled with your settings and fixed any problems , you can compare how your system is doing now to how it was performing when you took the baseline measurement . CheckIt can also give you advice . You select problems like " I added a new adapter card to my computer and now it does n't work " or " My printer is printing strange characters and symbols " and get a list of possible solutions . REGISTRY CLEANUP RECOMMENDED : Symantec 's Norton System  --  Works 2001 Professional Edition , Ontrack SystemSuite 3 NOT ALL PROBLEMS are hardware related . Glitches in the Registry ( where Windows and your programs store their settings ) can cause all sorts of conflicts . That 's why you need a Registry cleaner  --  a program that examines your Windows Registry , lists problems , and ( with your permission ) fixes them . Microsoft also provides a free , bare-bones Registry cleaner program called RegClean that performs many of the functions of the suites but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you which Registry entries it is going to remove before deleting them . Download this from www.pcworld.com **27;4935;TOOLONG . All four suites come with Registry cleaners , and they all work reasonably well , although none will solve every Registry  --  based problem you might have . These programs tend to err on the side of caution , as deleting the wrong item in the Registry could seriously damage Windows . Even so , you should use them only after you do a full backup of your Registry . Of the four , SystemWorks Professional and SystemSuite stand out as the best . Norton WinDoctor in Symantec System  --  Works Professional wins particular kudos for automatically backing up the Registry before scanning it-an obvious precaution that no other suite takes , although all can back up the Registry on request . Ontrack SystemSuite 's RegistryFixer was the easiest to use for examining problems and selecting a solution . When more than one solution is possible , RegistryFixer lets you select the solution you want to try from a handy drop-down menu . Hard Drive Care and Feeding HARD DRIVES need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors and bad sectors . They also need to be defragmented occasionally , to reunite files that have been split across different sectors . Current versions of Windows come with perfectly good tools for both these jobs , but three of the four suites here offer scanners and defraggers that are faster or more flexible than the ones in Windows . But none of these suites improves upon Windows enough to make drive care alone worth the price of a utility suite . SCANNING RECOMMENDED : McAfee Utilities 4 , Symantec 's Norton SystemWorks 2001 Professional Edition , Ontrack SystemSuite 3 A DRIVE SCANNER looks for lost dusters ( sections of the disk that contain data not associated with any file ) , cross-linked files ( two files that have been assigned the same clusters of data ) , and other errors in your file and directory structure . If you do n't mind waiting a while ( sometimes hours ) , a scanner will physically test the surface of your disk , looking for spots that are in danger of going or have already gone bad . McAfee Utilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with drive scanners that are nearly identical in function , and all seem better than ScanDisk , the one built into Windows . They can do more thorough ( and therefore slower ) physical tests , and check parts of the disk that ScanDisk skips , such as the partition table . DEFRAGMENTING RECOMMENDED : McAfee Utilities 4 , Ontrack SystemSuite 3 AS YOU CREATE , modify , and delete files , their dusters get out of sequence-resulting in slower reads and writes . Defragging your disk puts each file 's clusters in sequence and arranges your files or programs for faster access . Windows comes with its own Disk Defragmenter , which McAfee Utilities , Norton System.Works , and Ontrack SystemSuite all try to improve on . McAfee 's DiskTune did the best job , providing the best defragger overall . It ran our tests smoothly , and in most of our tests , it proved faster than the competition , although all of the products took several hours to defragment the data on our test system ( a Dell PC with a Pentium III Goo-MHz processor , 128MB of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . SystemSuite 's JetDefrag is another good choice-not as fast as McAfee , but faster than SystemWorks or Windows . However , both Symantec 's SpeedDisk and Windows ' Disk Defragmenter had a serious problem : They were plagued by constant restarts , making it difficult to complete our tests . After some investigation , we found that the problem was with the Windows swap file , which is used to store virtual memory . As the defragging program ran , it used more memory , causing the swap file to grow , which in turn caused the defragger to restart because the contents of the disk had changed . Symantec recommended that we change the virtual memory settings to stop the swap file from growing , as detailed in the SystemWorks readme file ( but not in the manual ) . But even with this fix , Norton 's defrag took several times longer than the defraggers bundled with the other suites . Symantec claims that it is working on a patch to deal with this problem , but it was not available to test at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , and if another program writes something to disk during the defragging process , that too can force the defragging program to restart . It seems to make sense , therefore , to have no other program running when a defrag is in progress . However , on our test system , SystemWorks was the only program to display this problem . McAfee Utilities has another program , ActiveTune , which defrags in the background by saving data in parts of the drive where it wo n't get fragmented . In our informal tests , Active Tune did n't affect performance one way or another , although it may be that it takes a long time ( and a lot of writing to and reading the disk ) to make a difference . PARTITIONING RECOMMENDED : DriveWorks , PartitionMagic SOME PEOPLE prefer to work with their hard disk set up as one large space ; others like to partition and organize their disk into multiple logical drives , each with its own drive letter . A partition manager lets you create , resize , and move partitions on the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the utilities we recommend for every power user who wants to take control of their drives . // MCAFEE 'S DISKTUNE , like most disk defragmenters , provides a visual representation of the defragmentation process by mapping the data on the disk in color . // None of the utility suites reviewed here offers a partition manager . Windows includes the fdisk utility for partitioning , but using it will delete every existing file on the hard drive-so you must back up your data first and reinstall the OS , your apps , and your data after partitioning . If you want to manage partitions without disturbing data ( although you should always back up anything you ca n't replace before making any changes ) , you need to buy another program for the job . We looked at two partitioning programs , PowerQuest 's PartitionMagic ( $55 , www.powerquest.com ) and Vcom 's DriveWorks ( $57 , www.vcom.com ) . PartitionMagic is the more powerful of the two programs . For one thing , it 's faster , resizing an existing partition in a little more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks as well , such as password-protecting partitions and converting them between different file systems . It even comes with an extra program that helps installed applications adjust to the new drive-letter mapping that comes with partitioning . Managing partitions-at least managing a partition you 're using-is one of those jobs that ca n't be done from inside a multitasking environment like Windows . Nevertheless , PartitionMagic is a Windows program . How does it do its tricks ? Simple . You tell it what changes you want to make , dick a button , and it exits Windows , changes the partition , and reboots back into Windows . DriveWorks costs about as much as PartitionMagic , but lacks such features as password protection and the ability to switch between multiple OSes on the same PC . So why even consider it ? Because it 's four utilities ( disk partitioning , disk imaging , disk copying , and secure erasing of partitions ) for the same price as PartitionMagic . In addition to managing partitions , DriveWorks backs them up ( see " Preserve Your Windows Setup " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backup from PowerQuest , you 'd have to buy the $70 Drive Image as well as PartitionMagic. // TEST REPORT // Roedy Green , a consultant in New Westminster , British Columbia . // Avoiding File Mania WINDOWS HAs a nasty habit of littering your disk with junk files when it crashes , and many programs can leave files behind when you uninstall them . And unless your own work habits are absolutely perfect , you might lose track of your own files too . That 's why you need help cleaning out unnecessary files , organizing the necessary ones , and archiving those you want to put away for a while . Iolo 's System Mechanic has the best tools for finding files suitable for deletion , but Ontrack 's SystemSuite has other file management tricks up its sleeve . However , there 's one job at which all the suites we looked at fail miserably : uninstalling applications . PROGRAM REMOVAL RECOMMENDED : Windows MOST WINDOWS applications extend tentacles deep into the operating system and never let go : They put files into various directories , stick stuff into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder . These same applications come with uninstall programs that do n't always remove all those tentacles . Windows ' own Install/Uninstall utility , which you can access from Add/Remove Programs in Windows ' Control Panel , simply launches the applications ' own uninstallers . Both Symantec 's Norton System Works 2001 Professional and Ontrack 's SystemSuite come with more ambitious uninstaller programs , called CleanSweep and EasyUninstall , respectively , that are supposed to do a better job of removing any application . There are two approaches to this task : monitoring the installation ( which CleanSweep and EasyUninstall do ) or keeping an eye on any and all new files that are added to the system during an installation ( which only EasyUninstall does ) . Our tests showed disappointing results with monitoring an installation because of the way the monitoring works . Many modern installers actually do nothing but launch other programs . These alter your system while the uninstaller is monitoring the main installer , which is doing nothing . The result : Changes happen but are n't recorded . We ran our tests several times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work consistently : On the same machine with exactly the same data on the drive , it monitored the installation of Adobe Photoshop once , then failed to monitor it the second time . SystemSuite 's EasyUninstall also failed to note that any changes had been made when we installed Photoshop . EasyUninstall also had problems when we tried monitoring changes to the system . It monitored the installation of another program without incident , but when we tried removing that program , EasyUninstall crashed and then made the machine unbootable because it had deleted several key files , even though it was supposed to protect such files . Both Ontrack and Symantec admitted that there are issues with their uninstallers , but they were unable to provide us with solutions . Basically , modern installation programs are too complex for uninstalling utilities to deal with . We advise you to stick with the uninstallation routine recommended by the program 's vendor and not use these uninstallers , because they do n't work . Skipping the ShrinkWrap DO N'T WANT TO buy and install a utility suite ? You can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McAfee.com provides the most comprehensive online utilities service . For a yearly subscription , it offers extensive diagnostics and system optimization and protection tools . McAfee. com 's services include virus scanning-whether you 're connected to the Internet or not-a performance optimizer , advice on configuring Windows , an uninstaller , and a tool for recovering damaged files . Most of these online services are based on the same code that underlies McAfee Utilities . But Web-based utility services have their own problems . Despite claims that McAfee.com works with Internet Explorer 4.0 and higher , many of its features refused to work when we tried them with Internet Explorer 5.0 . The problem was fixed when we upgraded , on McAfee 's recommendation , to Internet Explorer 5.5 . Ironically , one of the features we could not test until we upgraded the browser was Oil Change , a tool for upgrading your software to the latest versions available . Oil Change is one of several Web-based upgrade aids . These sites scan your hard drive for programs , and then tell you what updates are available for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide if the changes are worthwhile , and provide links for downloading the necessary files . Oil Change charges $19.95 a year for its services . Two of the site 's competitors , Catchup.com and Norton Web Services ( nortonweb. zdnet.com ) , are free . ( Both Catchup. com and Norton Web Services are operated by CNet Networks , a PC World competitor . ) Both Norton SystemWorks and Ontrack SystemSuite , by the way , try to pass off a free online application updating tool as a feature you 've paid for . SystemWorks has a link to Norton Web Services , and SystemSuite points you to updates.com . But both of these services are free , whether or not you 've purchased a suite . FILE CLEANUP RECOMMENDED : Iolo System Mechanic 3.6 NORTON SYSTEMWORXS ' CleanSweep and Ontrack SystemSuite 's EasyUninstall are n't totally worthless , since they do another job very well : cleaning out unnecessary files . System Mechanic and McAfee Utilities can also do this . // But lo 's System Mechanic has the best file cleaner , making it the one job this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsolete files-and you can easily define just what an obsolete file is . You can limit the search by file extension , date , or location . Once System Mechanic finds the files , you can delete them or move them to a different location , such as another folder , partition , or drive . By contrast , McAfee Utilities offers only a slimmed-down version of the company 's separately sold uninstaller and cleanup program , McAfee QuickClean . This simple program is easy to use but does n't offer much control . It gives you the option to shred your unwanted files so they ca n't be recovered , but not to store them elsewhere-a far more practical choice for most people . The capabilities of Symantec 's SystemWorks Professional and of Ontrack SystemSuite fall in between these extremes . They each have a quick , easy cleanup tool similar to McAfee 's , plus a more substantial program that lets you filter your search . But neither of these programs is as flexible as System Mechanic . FILE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDED : Ontrack SystemSuite 3 ONTRACK 'S SYSTEMSUITE offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The minor one , Size Manager , can display your drive as a bar graph , showing just how much room each folder and its subfolders are taking . The major one is PowerDesk 4 Pro ( which is also available separately for about $20 ) . PowerDesk is the file manager that Windows Explorer should have been . It lets you view , copy , and print the contents of just about any file ; easily upload and download files using the Internet 's FTP protocol ; and copy and move files to folders that are n't currently visible . In addition to PowerDesk , SystemSuite offers Zip Tools , a very robust program that extends PowerDesk 's compression features with tricks like zipping files and attaching them to e-mail , zipping files in Windows Explorer with a single mouse click , and backing up your documents . McAfee 's similar Zip Manager also integrates with Windows Explorer . It 's a decent , basic tool similar to WinZip . Preserve Your Windows Setup IT 'S ALL TOO EASY to break Windows and create problems that do n't go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your configuration , and-boom ! - your CD-ROM drive wo n't work . Or Windows wo n't boot at all . System meltdowns are why you need ways to back up and restore the key files of your Windows configuration . Or for the ultimate in protection , you might want to back up your entire partition or hard drive so you can easily restore it . REGISTRY BACKUP RECOMMENDED : Windows Millennium Edition , Ontrack SystemSuite 3 THREE OF THE four suites ( but not Iolo 's System Mechanic ) have tools that can take a " snapshot " of the Windows Registry and other important system files , and then restore these files from the snapshot . So does Windows Millennium Edition . The System Restore feature of Windows Me takes snapshots of the Registry and other files at regular intervals , and at your request . If Windows is so broken it wo n't boot , you can restore the files from Win Me 's Emergency Boot Disk . If you have Windows Me , you do n't need to buy another program just for this purpose . McAfee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nowith their own Registry backup programs . If you do n't have Windows Me , use one of them . Besides , if you 're using a suite to clean and tune up your Registry , it 's handy ( and a good idea ) to use the Registry backup that 's at your fingertips before you start modifying . // TEST REPORT // SYMANTECS NORTON SYSTEMWORKS 2001 Professional Edition provides convenient entry screen for accessing the suite 's extensive set of utilities . // SYSTEMSUITE 'S SIZE MANAGER provides an easy way to see where all your disk space has gone by displaying each folder as a bar : The longer the bar , the more stuff in the folder . // SystemSuite 's SystemSaver is the best of the lot . It 's simple and straightforward to use , and it offers the option to save your backups as zip archives . Best of all , you control which files and settings you want to back up . If you decide , for instance , that the structure of your Start menu is worth saving , you can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Registry backups and restores ( as well as Registry cleanup ) . But the program lacks SystemSuite 's versatility . It 's also way too easy to inadvertently overwrite one backup with another . Norton Registry Tracker is far more ambitious than the others . It 's also far more complex and confusing , and this means that it is not as effective . By default , Registry Tracker does n't track the entire Registry . If you do n't go in and fiddle with the settings , you may discover that you did n't back up the right part of the Registry until it 's too late . Registry Tracker is also not installed if your OS is Windows 2000 : As with several other components of Norton Utilities , Symantec did not update this tool for Windows 2000 . PARTITION BACKUP RECOMMENDED : Vcom DriveWorks ULTIMATELY , THERE 's no protection like full protection . A partition backup program makes a copy of your entire partition , or your entire drive , including every file and setting . You can then return everything to exactly the condition it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the works . Of course , that kind of backup can take a lot of time and disk space . And like partition management , partition backup ca n't be done within Windows : All partition backup programs must be the only application running , so you have to exit Windows to do the backup . A partition restore should also be approached with some caution : You ca n't do just a partial restore of a partition . Although Norton Ghost and PowerQuest 's Drive Image do allow you to restore individual files from a partition backup , if you restore an entire partition , every change made since the backup was done will be irreversibly lost . Norton SystemWorks Pro is the only suite with a partition backup program  --  Norton Ghost . Ghost is also sold separately , and it 's not part of the $55 truncated version , SystemWorks 2001 . Unfortunately , Ghost is not friendly ; in fact , its terminology may scare some users . If you tell Ghost to back up your hard drive , the utility asks if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last place we 'd want to put our files . And if your " dump " is larger than aGB , you 'll be requested to " Insert Next Media " even if you 're backing up to a hard drive with plenty of room . Ghost also has the minimal interface you 'd expect in a program aimed at computing professionals . What 's worse , we found Ghost occasionally unreliable . Although it usually performed our tests without problems , sometimes a restored partition was unbootable because of missing or corrupted files , and we could n't start the PC using the bootable CD-Rs Ghost created during a backup . Even with Symantec 's assistance , we could not fix these glitches . PowerQuest 's $70 Drive Image worked through all of our tests without fuss , and the files were always restored . Our tests also showed Drive Image to be nearly twice as fast as Ghost in all operations . Drive Image is easier to use than Ghost , although it too is more suitable for users with some experience . The on-screen commands are clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you nothing and are horribly documented . On the other hand , Vcom has made its partition backup program as easy to use as its partition manager . But that 's because DriveWorks does both backup and partitioning . DriveWorks may not run within Windows , but it looks like Windows . And you can resize a partition or back it up from the same Start button , making life easier if you want to do a backup before you change anything . But the low cost of DriveWorks ( $57 , compared with the cost of PartitionMagic and Drive Image combined ) has its trade-offs . DriveWorks lacks Ghost 's and Drive Image 's functionality . For instance , it can not write to a CD-R or CD-RW disc , and it ca n't restore an individual file from a backup . And DriveWorks is even slower than Ghost . However , DriveWorks ' ease of use and lower price mean that it gets our recommendation . Shield Yourself From Harm YOU ' VE BEEN told over and over that you need to guard against viruses and prying eyes-and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety and privacy tools . No single program gets our recommendation in this category , but several of the suites have some nice features . For instance , Norton SystemWorks beats all the other suites in virus protection . ANTIVIRUS RECOMMENDED : Symantec 's Norton SystemWorks 2001 Professional Edition MAKE NO MISTAKE about it , a good antivirus program is the most important utility you should own-the one absolute must-have tool . It 's so important , in fact , that PC World will be doing a full comparative review of antivirus programs in our next issue , where we will be testing the ability of antivirus programs to find and kill viruses . In this story we look only at the speed of the antivirus modules and how easy they are to use . The important features of any modern antivirus program ( aside from the ability to find viruses ) are easy updates , speed of virus scanning , integration into Windows , and e-mail support . Screening e-mail is an especially important capability , since many viruses travel by e-mail these days . Only two suites , Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of those two , only Norton AntiVirus has true e-mail support . NAV integrates with the major e-mail programs ( including Outlook , Outlook Express , Eudora , and Netscape Messenger ) and checks e-mail coming into your computer via the Internet 's generic POPS e-mail standard , aiming to catch viruses before you receive them . This approach also works with other e-mail programs that use the POPS standard to receive email . Norton AntiVirus , which we found far more stable than the other programs in SystemWorks 2001 Professional , is also available separately for $40 . SystemSuite 's VirusScanner , by contrast , scans e-mail attachments only when they are saved to a drive . PRIVACY TOOLS RECOMMENDED : McAfee Utilities 4 IS SOMEONE ELSE watching you ? Windows keeps details of what you 're doing in a number of ways , and it is possible for someone to read these and see what you 've been doing on your PC . If you want to protect your privacy , you 'll have to regularly wipe out certain files and lists . All four suites offer tools to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the list of recently used documents . Cookies are small files used by Web sites to identify you . SystemSuite has the best cookie remover , making it easy to select just the cookies you want to delete . System.Suite has similar tools for clearing out the Internet cache and history . To keep your data truly private , you have to encrypt it . McAfee Utilities is the clear winner here : It comes with PGP , widely regarded as one of the best encryption programs around , with easy-to-set-up tools for encrypting files , folders , and e-mail on the fly . The only other suite that includes encryption is SystemSuite , as part of PowerDesk 4 Pro . But PowerDesk 's encryption is nowhere near as easy to use as PGP-if you use your encrypted files frequently , you 'll be tempted to keep them open to everyone . PowerDesk also lacks PGP 's easy e-mail integration . All four suites let you destroy a file so that it can not be recovered after deletion-they overwrite the area of the disk where the file was stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect your privacy in our " Fortress PC " story in the May issue , at www.pcworld. **29;4964;TOOLONG . No Size Fits All ALTHOUGH WE have selected Ontrack 's SystemSuite 3 as our Best Buy , chances are that no suite will fill all your utility needs . Even SystemSuite lacks tools that we would like to see ( such as proper e-mail virus scanning ) , and that lack may pose problems for some users . If you buy McAfee Utilities , for instance , you should definitely invest in an additional antivirus program and even a full partition backup program , such as Drive Image or DriveWorks . You do n't want to break the bank buying utilities . If you pick a strong package such as SystemSuite 3 and supplement it to fit your situation , you 'll be well prepared for the inevitable computer emergencies and housekeeping chores .

Should you buy an all-in-one suite Sidebar or several stand-alone products ? Neither solu Sidebar tion is satisfactory . No single suite can completely satisfy every Sidebar one 's utility needs , but building a collection of Sidebar stand-alone utilities would be far more expensive than buying a suite . Your best bet is to buy a good suite and then augment it with any additional utilities that you need . If you get McAfee Utilities , for instance , you should definitely invest in an additional antivirus program . You might also consider a full partition backup program , such as Drive Image . Obviously , you do n't want to break the bank buying utilities . Ask yourself what features you need most of all , and make your choices accordingly . Sidebar When Utilities Attack Sidebar WHEN UTILITY SUITES go bad , watch out . Ironically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your vital system files , only to wish you had made such a backup before you installed it . Consider the case of Roedy Green , a consultant in New Westminster , British Columbia . Green had been a fan of Norton Utilities and Norton SystemWorks for years , but when he installed SystemWorks 2001 on his Windows NT machine , what followed was a nightmare . The first time around , the installation proceeded without a hitch . Then , Green says , when he tried to run the program a second time , " nothing happened . " So he tried uninstalling , then reinstalling it . But now the program would n't install . Nor would it uninstall . " I tried maybe 10 or 20 times to uninstall it . I just Sidebar could n't believe that this thing would n't work . " He eventually succeeded in getting SystemWorks installed . But first he had to manually remove every reference to Symantec from the Registry , then delete every Symantec All file . WINDOCTOR AND OFFICE 2000 DO N'T MIX Sidebar HE HAS since managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clients using it . For instance , under Windows 2000 , the SystemWorks component WinDoctor reports a large number of problems if Office 2000 is installed . " Symantec admits that WinDoctor does this , and they say it 's Office 2000 's fault because it has a funny way of installing itself . Their suggestion was to tell WinDoctor to ignore Sidebar these errors , which is an odd way to deal with this problem . " He has also encountered the same problems with the Symantec disk def ragger that our tests found : " It kept restarting . I could n't track down what it is that makes it keep restarting . One thing I did find that was causing it was LiveUpdate , Symantec 's own updater appli Sidebar cation , which is rather embarrassing for them . " But Green still uses the program and will probably buy the next version as well . " I will certainly have a look at it , because they might have listened to my complaints . I think the problem ( with this version ) was testing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . " // <p>
