Chapter Two Luke wanted to read the note from Mr. Talbot right away . He was sure it would tell him everything everything he needed to know to survive Hendricks School for Boys . No to survive anything that might come his way in this new life , outside hiding . It was just one thin scrap of paper . Now that it was in his pocket , Luke could n't even feel it there . But he had faith . Jen 's father had hidden Luke from the Population Police , double-crossing his own employer . He 'd gotten Luke his fake I.D. , so he could move about as freely as anyone else , anyone who was n't an illegal third child . Jen 's father had risked his career helping Luke . No , it was more than that he 'd risked his life . Surely Mr. Talbot would have written something incredibly wise . Luke slid his hand into his pocket , his fingertips touching the top of the note . Ms. Hawkins was looking away . Maybe The door opened behind Luke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scared you , did n't I ? " a boy jeered . " Made you jump . " Luke was used to being teased . He had older brothers , after all . But Matthew and Mark 's teasing never sounded quite so mean . Still , Luke knew he had to answer . " Sure . I 'm jumpy like a cat , " Luke started to say . It was an expression of his mother 's . Being cat-jumpy was good . Like being quick on his feet . Just in time , Luke remembered he could n't mention cats . Cats were illegal , too , outlawed because they might take food that was supposed to go to starving humans . Back home , Luke had seen wild cats a few times , stalking the countryside . Dad had liked having them around because they ate rats and mice that might eat his grain . But if Luke were really Lee Grant , filthy-rich city boy , he would n't know a thing about cats , jumpy or otherwise . He clamped his mouth shut , closing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his head down , too scared to look the other boy right in the eye . The boy laughed , cruelly . He looked past Luke , to Ms. Hawkins . " What 's wrong with him ? " the boy asked , as if Luke were n't even there . " Ca n't talk or something ? " Luke wanted Ms. Hawkins to stick up for him , to say , " He 's just new . Do n't you remember what that 's like ? " But she was n't even paying attention . She frowned at the boy . " Rolly , take him to room one fifty-six . There 's an empty bed in there . Just put his suitcase down . Do n't waste time unpacking . Then take him back to Mr. Dirk 's history class with you . He 's already behind . Lord knows what his parents were thinking . " Rolly shrugged and turned around . " I did not dismiss you ! " Ms. Hawkins shrieked . " May I be dismissed ? " Rolly asked mockingly . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get . Go on with you . " Luke picked up his suitcase and followed , hoping Rolly 's request for dismissal would work for both of them . Either it did , or Ms. Hawkins did n't care . In the hallway , Rolly took big steps . He was a good head taller than Luke , and had longer legs . It was all Luke could do to keep up , what with the suitcase banging against his ankles . Rolly looked back over his shoulder , and started walking faster . He raced up a long stairway . By the time Luke reached the top , Rolly was nowhere in sight . " Boo ! " Rolly leaped out from behind the newel post . Luke jumped so high , he lost his balance and teetered on the edge of the stairs . Rolly reached out , and Luke thought , See , he 's not so bad . He 's going to catch me . But Rolly pushed instead . Luke fell backwards . He might have tumbled down all the stairs , except that Rolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railing . Pain shot through his back . Rolly laughed . " Got you good , did n't I ? " he said . Then , strangely , he grabbed Luke 's bag and took off down the hall . Luke was afraid he was stealing it . He galloped after Rolly . Rolly screamed with laughter , maniacally . This was not what Luke had expected . Rolly dodged around a corner and Luke followed him . Rolly discovered a secret about Luke 's bag that Luke had missed it was on wheels . So Rolly could run at full-speed with the bag rolling behind him . He careened this way and that , the bag zigzagging from side to side . Luke got close enough to tackle it if he wanted , but he hesitated . If the bag had been full of his own clothes , all the hand-me-down jeans and flannel shirts he 'd gotten after Matthew and Mark outgrew them , he would have leaped . But the bag held Baron clothes , stiff shirts and shiny pants that were supposed to make him look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't risk ruining them . He focused on Rolly instead . Instinctively , Luke dove over the bag to catch Rolly 's legs . It was like playing football . Rolly fell to the ground with a crash . " Just what is the meaning of this ? " a man 's voice boomed above them . Rolly was instantly on his feet . " He attacked me , sir , " Rolly said . " I was showing the new boy his room and he attacked me . " Luke opened his mouth to protest , but nothing came out . He 'd learned that from Matthew and Mark : Do n't tattle . The man looked dismissively from Rolly to Luke . " What is your name , young man ? " Luke froze . He had to stop himself from saying his real name automatically . Then he had a split second of fearing he would n't be able to remember the name he was supposed to use . Was he taking too long ? The man 's glare intensified . " L-L-Lee . Lee Grant , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the man snapped . " This is a fine way to begin your academic career at Hendricks . You and Mr. Sturgeon each have two demerits for this disgraceful display . You may report to my room after the final bell to do your time . " " But , sir , I told you , " Rolly protested . " He attacked me . " " Very well , Mr. Sturgeon . Make that three demerits for each of you . " " But " Rolly was undeterred . " Four . " Rolly was going to complain again . Luke could tell by the way he was standing . But the man turned away and began walking down the hall , as if Rolly and Luke were both too unimportant to bother with , and he 'd wasted enough time already . Luke 's head swam with questions . What were demerits ? When was final bell ? Where was this man 's room ? Who was he , anyway ? Luke tried to muster up the nerve to call after the man or to ask Rolly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindsided with a shove that sent him crashing into the wall . " Fonrol ! " Rolly exploded . Luke slumped against the wall . His shoulder throbbed . Why did Rolly seem to hate him so much ? " Well , come on , you little exnay , " Rolly taunted . " Want to get demerits from Mr. Dirk , too ? " He stepped backwards , tugging on Luke 's suitcase . Then he shoved it through a nearby doorway . Luke looked up and saw 156 etched on a copper plaque on the door . Relief overwhelmed him . Finally something made sense . This was his room . The rest of the day would be horrible he 'd already resigned himself to that . But eventually it would be night , and he 'd be sent to bed , and he could come to this room and shut the door . And then he could read the note from Jen 's dad , if he did n't get a chance to read it before bedtime . Come nightfall , he 'd know everything and be safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that awaited him in only a matter of hours , he got brave enough to peek around the corner . The room held eight beds . Seven of them were made up , with rich blue spreads stretched tautly from top to bottom . Only one , a lower bunk , was covered just by sheets . Luke felt as desolate as that bed looked . He knew it was his . And he knew he would n't get to be alone in this room . He probably would n't be safe , either , not if any of his seven roommates were anything like Rolly . He edged his hand into his pocket , his fingers brushing the note from Jen 's dad . What if he just pulled it out and read it now , right in front of Rolly ? He did n't dare . The way the last ten minutes had gone , Rolly would probably rip the note to shreds before Luke even had it completely out of his pocket . And Jen 's dad had acted like it was secret . If Ms. Hawkins was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolly could be trusted . Rolly hit Luke on the shoulder . " Tag ! You 're it ! " he hollered , and took off running . Panicked , Luke chased after him .
