<p> One of the costliest construction projects in city history , a $2.1 billion water filtration plant in the Bronx that has been troubled by delays , community opposition and charges of mismanagement , is now being fined $30,000 a day by the federal government because there is no primary contractor to start the work . <p> The city 's Department of Investigation has hired a law firm to monitor the project , which has more than doubled in price from the estimated cost in 2004 . <p> For the past two years the city has been building , 100 feet below Van Cortlandt Park , the Croton Water Filtration Plant , which is scheduled to become operational in 2012 . A large swath of the southeast portion of the park has been cleared of grass and trees , and digging is under way . But work on the filtration plant itself has not begun , officials said , even though the city was required by a federal court consent decree to hire a contractor for the job by February . <p> The price of the project will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for property owners , city officials said . <p> The city 's Department of Environmental Protection , which is overseeing construction of the Croton plant , said yesterday that a $1.3 billion deal to build the filtration plant would be completed by the end of this month . The agreement with a construction consortium led by the Skanska Corporation would be the largest single construction contract in city history , according to city officials . <p> Emily Lloyd , commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection , said the complexity of the work was a major reason for the delays . " This is an enormous project and a very complicated process , " Ms. Lloyd said . " It was very difficult to site and design . It will be one of the largest filtration plants in the world . " <p> Critics of the project say they believe the plant 's price could climb as high as $3 billion . " There certainly appears to be the possibility of fraud or waste or mismanagement , " said Jeffrey Dinowitz , who represents the area in the State Assembly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are costs that can not be explained away by inflation and rising labor costs . " <p> Opponents of the project , citing what they say is improper oversight , have pressed for an independent investigation and a detailed accounting of the budget . " You have cost overruns that are astronomical , " said Gary Axelbank , a neighborhood resident and opponent . Officials at the Department of Environmental Protection said they had already provided an accounting of the agency 's spending , which has included contracts for tunneling , site preparation and electrical , plumbing and ventilation work . <p> Steve Lawitts , the agency 's first deputy commissioner , said the plant 's 2003 projected cost of $992 million had been determined without calculating for inflation , which would have put the cost at $1.7 billion in 2007 dollars . <p> In addition , Mr. Lawitts said , the original model for the filtration plant had been " based on a conceptual plan , not a detailed design , " a common practice when planning large projects . <p> Opponents said they were also concerned that the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , Stier Anderson L.L.C. , was not an objective party because it was being paid by the Department of Environmental Protection . But city officials said that Stier Anderson had performed similar duties for the city , including monitoring construction work at the World Trade Center site . <p> The long-running dispute over the filtration plant illustrates the key role the Croton watershed system plays in the life of the city . <p> The watershed , made up of reservoirs in Dutchess , Putnam and Westchester Counties , provides 100 million gallons of water to the city each day , or about 10 percent of the city 's drinking water . <p> Runoff is collected from an area that extends into western Connecticut and is chlorinated as it flows downstream . It is then stored in the Jerome Park Reservoir in the Bronx before being distributed to homes , most of them in the Bronx and Manhattan . <p> The rest of the city 's drinking water is supplied by the Catskill and Delaware watersheds . The water from those systems , which are in upstate counties far more rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher quality than Croton 's and so far has not needed filtering . <p> The Croton system 's water , however , is often plagued by discoloration , odor , bad taste and occasional fly larvae , according to the city , though none of those conditions pose public health risks . <p> The tangled path toward erecting the Croton filtration plant , which was suggested as early as 1913 , was set in motion by a 1989 federal law requiring surface water systems to be filtered unless there is a compelling reason for a waiver . <p> The city did not seek a waiver for the Croton watershed and agreed to filter the system 's water , but the federal government sued the city in 1997 after the Giuliani administration failed to meet filtration deadlines . <p> The lawsuit was resolved by a federal court consent decree that imposed a $1 million fine on the city and a time line for construction of a filtration system that was to be completed by September 2006 . <p> Since then , planning and construction of the plant have been dogged by opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city chose after opposition arose to placing it at the Jerome Park Reservoir . <p> The city has long maintained that building the Croton facility beneath Van Cortlandt Park would be less expensive and make more sense in terms of water distribution than other locations that it had studied , including an industrial section of Mount Pleasant in Westchester County . <p> Acting on a lawsuit filed by residents near Van Cortlandt Park , the State Court of Appeals ruled in 2001 that construction could not begin until the Legislature voted specifically to allow parkland to be used for the project , as it eventually did . In exchange for building at Van Cortlandt Park , the city agreed to spend $243 million for park improvements in the Bronx . <p> After the city failed to meet the court-mandated deadline to hire the main contractor by February , the federal government imposed the daily $30,000 fine . <p> Then , two months later , negotiations between the city and the project 's low bidder , a joint venture led by the Perini Corporation , abruptly broke off after the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet city requirements for hiring women and minority subcontractors , officials said . A spokesman for Perini did not return a call seeking comment . <p> The project 's only other bidder was the Skanska Construction joint venture , whose $1.3 billion bid was $200 million more than the Perini consortium 's price . <p> Referring to the prospect of even higher costs , Assemblyman Dinowitz said , " Everybody in my community thinks the worst .
