<p> San Francisco is a great town for walking : The architecture , the people , the vistas are all compelling . But for lifetime movie buffs , it 's also a city replete with movie memories . <p> There 's barely a part of the city that is n't endowed , thanks to Hollywood , with some kind of cinematic association . Turn a corner and there 's the spot where two characters stole a kiss . Down the block there 's the site of a shootout , a stakeout or an attempted suicide . <p> Can anyone go to Fort Point and not remember Kim Novak 's jump into the bay from " Vertigo " ( 1957 ) ? Or drive up hills Nob , Russian and Potrero without flashing back to Steve McQueen 's adrenaline-pumping chase scene in " Bullitt " ( 1968 ) ? <p> For movie lovers , the rich memory bank of San Francisco includes much more than cable cars , the Golden Gate Bridge and the endlessly photographed Palace of Fine Arts : It incorporates every neighborhood and films from nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , let 's start at the foot of Market Street and see what images start flooding in . <p> Our tour begins in the Hyatt Regency atrium lobby . That 's where Mel Brooks attended a psychiatric convention in his Hitchcock spoof , " High Anxiety " ( 1977 ) .

Look down the steep Filbert Street steps : That 's where Julie Christie got carted off on a gurney in " Petulia " and Humphrey Bogart re-entered the city after escaping San Quentin in " Dark Passage " ( 1947 ) . <p> Bogie was lucky in that movie : He found refuge in the exquisite Art Deco building at 1360 Montgomery , where Lauren Bacall lived .

At the corner of Lombard and Leavenworth streets , beneath the crookedest street in the world , she seduced Mark Harmon on the trunk of her Corvette in " The Presidio " ( 1988 ) . Walk down Russian Hill to the Buena Vista Cafe , at 2765 Hyde St. , and you 'll find the counter where Ryan met Andy Garcia in the opening scene of " When a Man Loves a Woman " ( 1994 ) . <p> Close by is Aquatic Pier , where Wayne Wang shot a key scene for " Chan Is Missing " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now it 's time to grab a cab : Good luck finding one .

" That scene was shot at the old , lamented Surf Theater , a repertory cinema at 48th Avenue and Irving Street . <p> The tour ends , inevitably , at the Golden Gate Bridge . The movies shot here are innumerable , everything from " The Love Bug " ( 1969 ) to " A View to a Kill " ( 1985 ) , which staged a death match on the north tower between James Bond ( Roger Moore ) and peroxided , ax-wielding villain Christopher Walken . <p> This is only a partial list , a glimpse , really , at the celluloid images captured in San Francisco . The tradition goes on : Already this year , three major films have been shot here : " Bedazzled " with Brendan Fraser , " Sweet November " with Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron and " The Wedding Planner " with Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Lopez . <p> In 40 or 50 years , those films may embody someone 's romantic notions of San Francisco  --  a city that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way " Vertigo " does for so many movie lovers today . <p> E-mail Edward Guthmann at guthmanne@sfgate.com
