Transmission 01 : over the shirt , under the bra <p> September <p> Peckerbrook High  --  like every other high school  --  sucks . But Peckerbrook sucks for one or maybe two specific reasons in addition to all the other reasons high schools suck in general . <p> At Peckerbrook , every pupil is either " artistic " ( as implied by its status as a Performing Arts Magnet School ) or black . This is n't to say that there are n't blackpeople registered in the vaunted arts classes . But in a school that is sixty-five percent African-American ( a " vibrant and culturally rich community " is what the brochure says ) , only five people of color are involved in its arts program , which includes hundreds of students . <p> Most of us white kids are bussed in from the wealthier communities in the northern sector of the county . The rest of us have mothers like mine  --  women living in the squalor of the outer city limits who see their children succeeding where they never could , insisting that their sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frickin ' Streisands . <p> The black kids laugh at us " performing " white folk , then deal drugs right in front of the school , selling little bags of weed and crack after the faculty has gone home for the day . <p> Once I had to wait for my mother to pick me up ( she was late , as usual ) , and these four crack-slingers walked over and just started beating on my head . A Samaritan in a BMW pulled up moments later and chased them away with an umbrella and his middle-class white-man authority . <p> My first day in drama this tall , unaffected Amazon of a girl sits beside me as I cocoon myself in a corner of the theater . <p> " You do n't need to worry , " she assures me . " All the drama people are cool . " I try smiling at her . <p> She is beautiful . She says her name is Tabitha . And unlike much of Atlanta , which consists of people who have transferred here from all points north , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the top of her shirt like an answer to prayer . <p> Class begins with a series of exercises where everybody lies on the floor and focuses on their breathing . <p> Breathe . <p> Listen to yourself breathe . <p> Then comes the " stress reduction " massage . <p> Tabitha scoots up next to me and asks if I 'll " do " her . <p> " Do ? Yeah . . . ok . " <p> She lies in front of me and waits , eyes closed . <p> I touch her , allowing the palms of my hands to skim the linen of her shirt . <p> She asks if I am going to actually rub her back or just pretend . <p> " This part is n't supposed to be acting , " she informs me . <p> " I know , I was just warming up , " I say , trying to sound natural . <p> I begin at her neck , for real this time , kneading soft circles around the muscles and then down the spine and out to the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her body . <p> This goes on for some time before she begins moaning softly and I have to . . . readjust . With every moan I become more aroused and with every readjustment it seems she moans louder . <p> " Go under my shirt , " she says . <p> I pull her shirt up to the middle of her back , just below the bra strap , and watch as goose bumps form . She is magnificent . <p> " Pull it up all the way . " <p> " All the way ? " I whisper . <p> " Yeah , all the way , " she repeats , her head on her forearms , eyes still closed . She rises off the floor slightly so that I can get her t-shirt past her bra . I look around at the rest of the class to gauge how they are dealing with the striptease developing in their midst but no one seems to have the slightest idea . <p> " Does this feel good ? " I ask , trying to keep my breathing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow . " Good . " <p> I continue rubbing , trying to be professional about it and all . <p> Then she pushes herself up onto her forearms , turns to face me . " Two things , " she says . " I want you to take your index and middle fingers on both hands , bend them at the knuckle , then pinch and twist . It feels better when it hurts a little . " <p> She lies down again and closes her eyes like before . I look at my hands and practice the twisting motion with my fingers before I go back to work on her . " What was the second thing ? " <p> " Oh , that 's right , " Tabitha purrs as I pinch her . " Unsnap my bra . " <p> I want to make love to her . <p> " How do you do that ? " Now I 'm panicking . <p> " Just push the ends in toward each other and it 'll snap free . " <p> Finally the clasp loosens and separates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bottom with a hard-on , her naked back begging me to touch it , to make love to it with my fingers . I can see her tan lines and how the sides of her breasts remain their natural flesh tone , completely uncorrupted by sun . <p> The more I rub the harder I get and I wonder if she can feel me through my pants . I want her to feel me . The tanned canvas of her back is mine for the taking and I imagine myself an artist of the highest vocation , sculpting her into immortality . <p> Her skin gathers between my fingers , and no matter how hard I pull or pinch , it always snaps back into place leaving a red welt , the only reminder of my concentrated ministrations . She moans with every twist , every pull . Her breasts protrude on either side of her prone body , pushed out slightly . There are no visible nipples or anything of that magnitude , but there is the definitive swell . It is the unmistakable sight of finality , fullness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It occurs to me that I 've never seen a real-life breast until that moment . <p> " Why 'd you stop rubbing ? " <p> I 'm stuck , staring at her breast swells , my hands motionless on her back . <p> <br> Continues ...
