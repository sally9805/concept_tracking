I never saw the signs . I thought everything was fine . But then my toddler told me what had been going on while I was out . Hiring Alex* to babysit my two little boys seemed like a brilliant idea . The 16-year-old son of a woman I worked with , he looked like a stunt double for Brad Pitt in Thelma &; Louise . As soon as he walked through the door , my husband , Chris , and I took to him . And a male babysitter , I figured , could handle the high-octane energy of Charlie , then eight , and David , two and a half . It became a ritual for Alex to come over on Saturday night . My boys loved it . Pizza , TV , a cool guy who 'll let us stay up late ! Chris and I always chatted with Alex and were impressed by how polite and well-spoken he was . And knowing about Alex 's difficult life at home-his mother , Susan , had shared stories about her ongoing train wreck of a divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . One night when my parents were visiting , we went out to dinner while the kids stayed home with Alex . We 'd all planned to go to a movie afterward , but at the last minute , my mom and dad begged off and returned to our house . When Chris and I got back later that evening , my mother took me aside . " Honey , " she said , " when we got here , the kids were in the bedroom with that boy , and all three of them had their shirts off . He said he was giving them massages and seemed startled to see us . I do n't know , but it does n't seem right . You hear such terrible stuff these days about what goes on . " I was furious . What was she implying ? That I did n't know what kind of babysitter to hire ? That I was n't a good mommy ? That I 'd invited a pervert into our home ? " Do n't be silly , " I said in what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK . " But it wasn't. a few weeks later , I was trying to encourage David to use his potty-chair . " Mommy , see my penis ? " he said happily . " It gets little and big just like Alex 's . " I looked at my innocent toddler-the kind of beautiful child absolutely everyone wanted to cuddle and hug . " David , sweetie , what did you say ? " My little boy repeated the words . I quickly put a fresh diaper on him and raced out of the bathroom to find my husband . Together , we talked to David . " When did you see Alex 's penis ? " I asked , trying to sound casual . Perhaps David had simply barged in on Alex while he was peeing . " He asked me to touch it . " " Did anything else happen ? " my husband said . " He had me lick it . " Barely breathing , Chris and I put David to bed . Then we turned our attention to Charlie . " Did anything , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " What do you mean , strange ? " he said , not looking me in the eye . Charlie was in third grade . He 'd been drilled by his teachers and by us about " inappropriate behavior . " We told him what his brother had said . " Did anything like that happen to you ? " Charlie 's first reaction was to be completely grossed out ; then , in the way kids have of shutting down just when you want them to talk , he suddenly had nothing to say . Still , he did allow that Alex seemed " weird . " Our babysitter apparently preferred to hang out with David in the boys ' bedroom while Charlie watched TV in the downstairs den . It never crossed my mind to call the police . But I knew I had to find a doctor for David-and possibly for all of us-immediately . My first instinct was to talk to my boss . She was not just a sympathetic soul-a mom with two young children-but the wife of a doctor at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her what had happened , and she agreed to limit my contact with Susan as much as possible . By the following day , my boss had found the name of a clinical psychologist , whom I 'll call Dr. Green , who specialized in treating very young , barely verbal patients . Dr. Green quickly established that Charlie had n't been around when the actual sexual abuse occurred ; further sessions with him would n't be necessary . David , though , would need continuing attention through play therapy . Dr. Green also told me he wanted to meet with Alex , saying that the boy needed treatment " while there 's still time to get him back on track . " And the doctor insisted that I tell Susan what her child had done to mine . I dreaded the conversation , but it would have been irresponsible not to have it . If I did n't , how many other kids might Alex go on to abuse ? I 'd been coached : Repeat , word for word , what David had told us , then ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reacted with indignant denial . " David must have made it up ! " she hissed . " Alex would never , ever do anything like this . Get out of my sight . " Trying hard to stay composed , I handed her the doctor 's number . Then I returned to my office , shut the door , and started to sob . To her enormous credit , Susan made the call . I do n't know where she found the guts , but she set up an appointment with Dr. Green . At work , she and I avoided each other . during every moment with David , I was like a detective , on guard for any sign that he 'd been harmed , that irrevocable damage had been done . He struck me as somewhat dingier than usual-and he could n't have been less interested in toilet training . Otherwise , he seemed like his same , adorable self . The doctor 's appointments continued uneventfully . Until one day . As Dr. Green explained it afterward , while playing with the anatomically correct dolls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll across the room . At that point , he and Dr. Green were finally able to talk about what had happened ( with some limitations , of course , considering David 's age ) . After two more appointments , the doctor said that as far as he knew , there had been no attempt at penetration-confirming our pediatrician 's opinion-and no more treatment would be necessary . " When he 's older , can problems develop from this ? " I asked . " It 's highly unlikely , now that he 's been treated , " the doctor said . " The memory wo n't be erased , but it will be buried . " " When David 's older , should we tell him what happened ? " was my second question . " No , " he advised . " It will only be confusing and upsetting . " We never saw Alex again , but we heard from him a few months later . He wrote us a rambling letter filled with apologies : Dr. Green , he said , had encouraged him to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He admitted everything and begged for forgiveness . As we read the letter , my husband and I wept ; when we were done , I crumpled it up and tossed it in the trash . We had no desire to relive the experience by rereading the letter , and we did n't care to write back . Our lives drifted slowly back to normal . My husband and I each worked out our own feelings about what had happened , and eventually , we did n't need to talk about it anymore . Neither of our sons has ever shown any sign that he remembers the incident . Susan enrolled Alex in boarding school . She quit her job and moved away . It 's been over 15 years since all this happened , and David , I 'm happy to say , has grown into a handsome and charming young man-athletic , talented , a good student . From all I can tell , he is completely normal . He 's had a few girlfriends , though he does n't share many details about his relationships . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I release that information on a need-to-know basis , and you have no need to know . " I had worried that I might become a clingy mom , too protective of David and Charlie . But that did n't happen . What I did become is a mother fiercely proud of her resourceful , independent sons . Whenever I read stories about kids abused by pedophiles , I realize how easily things could have turned out differently . Sidebar Babysitters : what parents need to know Q How can I be sure I 'm hiring a good babysitter ? A Take your time to find one : Get the names of possible sitters from people you know , and check other references . Invite the sitter to your house and watch how she and your child interact . Then remind her that she 'll be responsible for your child 's life . " It 's critical that whoever is going to take care of the child understand that , " says Patricia Keener , M.D. , the founder of Safe Sitter , a program that teaches babysitting skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A Yes , as far as sexual abuse is concerned . Seventy-seven percent of reported sexual assaults by babysitters are committed by males . Pay special attention to teenage boys : Nearly half of babysitter sex offenders are younger than 18 . Q Does that mean it 's safer to hire a girl ? A Not necessarily . Females commit 64 percent of the reported physical assaults-hitting , slapping-against kids by babysitters . But keep in mind that of all assaults , sexual or physical , against children , more than 90 percent are committed by family members or acquaintances-not by babysitters . Q What 's the deal with nanny cams ? A You can hide these small , wireless cameras in a room and , from any computer , monitor the images they 're sending . The cameras cost around $200 each and are legal in all 50 states ( though be aware that in 15 states , you ca n't record someone 's speech without her knowledge ) . You can also rent them ; one site to try is knowyournanny.com , where cameras cost about $50 each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to check up on my sitter ? A Every once in a while , make unannounced visits . " Go back and say , " I forgot something " or " I have a headache , ' ' " suggests Dr. Keener . And , at all times , the best thing you can do is trust your instincts . If you sense that something is wrong , do n't talk yourself out of it . Get to the bottom of the problem . - Bonnie Gibbs Sidebar During every moment with David , I was like a detective , on guard for signs that he 'd been harmed .
