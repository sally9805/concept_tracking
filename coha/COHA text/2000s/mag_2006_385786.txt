. Japan 's economy is buoyant . Can it last ? The next Prime Minister will inherit problems that could sink the island nation . A silver-haired prime minister furrows his brow as experts brief the Japanese cabinet on a looming national crisis . A trusted aide urges immediate action , but senior ministers scoff that nothing can be done . The chief cabinet secretary insists the danger be kept secret from the public . Junichiro Koizumi 's final days in power ? Not quite . It 's a scene from Nihon Chimbotsu ( Japan Sinks ) , a disaster flick that has played to packed theaters in Japan this summer . The movie , a remake of a 1973 sci-fi classic , turns on the premise that a collision of tectonic plates is dragging the Japanese archipelago to the bottom of the Pacific . The original Chimbotsu traded on Japanese insecurities during an oil embargo ; as waves closed in , the world 's nations refused to harbor Japanese refugees . But the remake finds this island nation newly buoyant . When he steps down this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best shape in nearly two decades . Unemployment is down , deflation has been all but licked , and wages and corporate profits are surging . Blue-chip companies like Canon and Toyota are doing so well they seem to inhabit a different realm in the global economy ; even Sony is turning around . Many analysts say the current expansion , now in its fifth year , will rumble on for another two with GDP growth of more than 2% . Yet even in good times , Chimbotsu 's subtext  --  that Japanese elites have a gift for dithering in the face of calamity  --  still rings true . In his five years in office , Koizumi blunted the worst excesses of the old Japan Inc . He rallied public opinion to face down special interest groups , slammed the lid on the government 's pork barrel , and prodded banks to cut off unprofitable borrowers . But he left huge problems unresolved . The nation 's debt-to-GDP ratio has ballooned to 170% , the highest among developed countries . The birth rate has plunged to 1.25% , far below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's population is aging at a pace without precedent in the industrial world . Such challenges are best tackled in a growing economy . But chief cabinet secretary Shinzo Abe ( ah-bay ) , the man all but certain to succeed Koizumi , does n't seem willing to do what 's needed to keep Japan afloat . In campaign appearances ahead of the Sept. 20 vote to choose the next president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party  --  and hence Japan 's next Prime Minister  --  Abe has barely mentioned economics , stressing instead his determination to reshape foreign policy and rewrite Japan 's pacifist constitution . Abe has hinted that he wo n't raise taxes , at least for a while , and he endorsed an annual growth target of 3% . The good news : That 's higher than the 2.2% assumed in the government 's latest fiscal restructuring plan . The bad news : Abe has offered no new ideas about how Japan can attain that goal , and some of his recent statements suggest he favors spending policies more likely to hurt growth than help . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two main rivals for the party presidency , Finance Minister Sadakazu Tanigaki and Foreign Minister Taro Aso , decried the widening gap between the best- and least-paid members of Japanese society and sought to outdo each other with promises to siphon more tax money from prospering cities to benighted provinces . " It 's not very encouraging that suddenly all the candidates want to talk about giving losers a second chance , " says Merrill Lynch economist Jesper Koll . " Koizumi made it clear that his policy was to back winners . " Nor does Abe 's leadership style inspire . Where Koizumi is a brash maverick who reveled in the slogan " Reform without sacred cows " and attacked his party 's old guard with visible glee , Abe  --  the son of a former Foreign Minister and grandson of former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi  --  is a cautious insider , steeped in the tradition of consensus building and incremental change . At 52 , Abe will be Japan 's youngest Prime Minister . He is a canny dealmaker and has shown flashes of charisma . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year with appeals for Japan to take a tougher line against North Korea . When Kim Jong Il made good on his threats to conduct missile tests over the Sea of Japan , Abe 's poll ratings soared . University of California political scientist Steven Vogel predicts Abe will stay within the broad contours of Koizumi 's economic agenda and dismisses fears that he 's a throwback to the old Japan . " A lot of this is political posturing , " he says . " Inequality is a hot issue now , so he 's trying to present himself as a kinder , gentler reformer . " Still , Vogel says it 's hard to envision Abe doing anything comparable to Kozuimi 's decision to kick anti-reformers out of the party ahead of last year 's general election and draft his own slate of " assassins " to campaign against them . " It will be a long time , " he says , " before we see another Japanese leader with Koizumi 's political genius . " Allies say Abe is only being pragmatic  --  that his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections , the party hangs onto the new seats Koizumi helped them win . If he succeeds , they argue , he 'll have a free hand to open debate on debt and demographics . But in the meantime Japan risks , if not sinking , shrinking . In the first half of this year Japan 's fertility rate improved a tad , the first time that has happened in six years . But demographers dismiss the gain as a faint second-generation echo of Japan 's postwar baby boom . Most believe total population peaked last year at 127.8 million and has begun a steep decline . The government estimates that by the end of the century , Japan 's population will contract to half its current size . The problem is n't just that Japanese are having fewer babies ; they 're also living longer . With 21% of its population over 65 , Japan has eclipsed Italy as the nation with the world 's highest percentage of old people . And it is expected to continue graying faster than anywhere else . The government projects that by 2050 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with just 6% in 1967 A shift of this magnitude would lop billions off Japan 's GDP and heap a staggering tax burden on its workers . " No further data is needed to confirm that Japan is heading toward a demographic disaster , " Japan 's leading financial daily said in a recent editorial . " Unless something truly effective is done very quickly , the nation will face devastating social and economic consequences . " In his recent book , Toward a Beautiful Country , Abe demonstrates his familiarity with the dire scenarios and devotes a chapter to " The Future of the Low-Birth State . " But he offers no suggestions about how those trends might be reversed . If anything , he seems resigned to their inevitability . He blithely writes that the pain of demographic decline can be offset by higher productivity , and that as long as the economy keeps growing , a smaller population means there will be more wealth per person . Well ... yes . But how to achieve those things ? Beyond vague references to " robots " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy options are obvious . One is to raise the retirement age , which remains stuck at 60 , even as life expectancies have risen to 78 for Japanese men and 85 for women . Easing restrictions on immigrant labor would also help . For all of Chimbotsu 's handwringing about the rejection of Japanese refugees , few nations are less receptive to foreigners than Japan , where immigrants account for 1% of the population . The most powerful thing that Japan can do to ward off demographic doomsday , says Goldman Sachs 's Kathy Matsui , is to make better use of its women , which she calls Japan 's " most underutilized resource . " Only about 55% of Japanese women work , compared with 65% in the U.S. , and only 9% of managers in Japan are women , compared with 46% in the U.S. Matsui says women are more willing to bear children the more opportunities they have to work outside the home . How much more willing is a matter of debate : The relationship between birth rates and female labor participation is a complex one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements , and other factors . The most remarkable thing about the debate , though , is that it is n't happening in the country where it matters most . " Every day I see businesspeople struggling to figure out how to make better use of the women on their payroll , " says Kaori Sasaki , president of e-Woman , a Tokyo marketing consultancy and member of several government advisory committees on women 's issues . " But when we talk about economic policy , it 's all about taxes , interest rates , and exchange rates . " Japan 's ambivalence about its birth dearth offers promise  --  and peril  --  for foreign firms . Swedish home-furnishing giant IKEA , which returned to Japan in April after a 20-year hiatus , has leaped into the fray with a marketing campaign questioning the commitment of Japanese men to domestic life . While early ads hewed to IKEA 's global slogan , " Home is the most important place in the world , " later spots hit closer to , well , home . " What time will you leave work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question , " Why do n't you skip work today ? " it was too subversive for executives at East Japan Railway . They banned the posters from their trains . Demographic decline is n't inevitable , as the Swedes themselves have found . And if the economy keeps growing , Japan still has time to get control of its debt . But for now many residents of the world 's second-largest economy would just as soon not be hectored about reform , thank you . A common refrain in conversations with Tokyo salarymen these days is that after all the turmoil of the ' ' 90s , things are " getting back to normal . " In many ways things are better than ever . HSBC economist Peter Morgan marvels that Japan seems to have " finally found a sweet spot . " In the absence of blatant policy errors , he says , " we might even get 2%-plus growth for another decade . " Maybe . But Japan 's economic fate depends on Koizumi 's successors getting back in reform mode before crisis overwhelms them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flee the country .
