Martha , a mother of two from Connecticut , has suffered from depression for the better part of two decades . She has been to psychiatrists and psychologists and tried dozens of medications , but nothing seemed to work very well or for very long . Then last June she heard about an experimental treatment being tested at the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia University . It involved aiming a powerful magnet at a spot on the brain to reset the wayward neural circuits that keep Martha , and millions like her , stuck in the downward spiral of depression . <P> Figuring she had little to lose , Martha agreed to the treatment and soon found herself sitting in a chair under a squat , gray crescent that administered a series of magnetic pulses to the top of her head . The treatment lasted for one hour , five times a week , for six weeks . " I started to see signs of change by about the third week , " she says . " By September , I was on top again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Returning to the institute every once in a while for repeat sessions of what researchers call repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , Martha has kept her symptoms at bay for the better part of six months . <P> That 's no fluke , according to a small group of doctors who have reported similar successes at research centers around the world . The National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) is sufficiently intrigued that it has asked the New York institute and three other groups to conduct a rigorous study of 240 depressed patients , comparing the effects of magnetic stimulation against a placebo . " Within the next few years , we 'll have a better idea of whether rTMS is safe and effective for depression , " says Dr. Sarah Lisanby , who is leading the study at the institute . There is also growing interest in exploring the use of the technique for the treatment of anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , stroke and perhaps epilepsy . <P> It 's all preliminary , but researchers believe they can use rTMS at the very least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain are wired together and what goes wrong when some of its signals get crossed . What they can not do at the moment , somewhat to their embarrassment , is explain why magnetic stimulation might ease anyone 's suffering . <P> But first we should make a couple of things clear . This kind of magnetic stimulation has nothing to do with the little bar magnets that arthritis sufferers sometimes wrap around their wrists or attach to their backs . Instead rTMS relies on sophisticated electromagnets similar to the ones used in MRI scanners , but these are small enough to hold in your hand and do n't make all that racket . <P> Moreover , it 's not the magnetic pulses that affect the brain but the modest electrical currents that the pulses induce  --  almost like an echo  --  in the brain 's nerve cells . At some frequencies , those electrical currents seem to stimulate neural pathways but at other frequencies inhibit them .
