<p> A DEBT WE SHOULD N'T COMPLETELY PAY <p> Editor  --  Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is a certified genius . ( After all , he is a Harvard man , and he has two Nobel laureates in the family . ) But he would have trouble passing an Economics 101 quiz today , on the basis of the remarks he made at a S.F. investment conference and to The Chronicle 's editorial board ( " Old-Fashioned Virtues Key to New Economy , " May 11 ) . <p> Summers ' insistence on the " economic imperative " of completely paying off the national debt during the next decade should send the first treasury secretary spinning in his grave . Alexander Hamilton built the new nation 's finances on the concept of creating and properly managing the federal debt . And today 's textbooks emphasize the importance of proper fiscal management  --  running surpluses to dampen demand during buoyant periods such as today , and running deficits to boost demand during recessionary periods . <p> President Clinton 's budget-reduction legislation of 1993 , which passed Congress without a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy and overflowing fiscal surpluses . But the concept of completely paying off the national debt , as Clinton and Summers are now trumpeting , is simply a throwback to the " old-fashioned virtues " espoused by President Hoover and Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in the 1920s . We all know what happened while they were constantly repeating their mantra of debt reduction at all costs . <p> WILLIAM M. BURKE <p> Ret . Federal Reserve economist <p> San Francisco <p> ALL-AMERICAN WEB <p> Editor  --  Your article on the Webbies , claiming , ( " World 's Best Web Sites Honored , " May 12 ) attracted my attention because I work in the Internet globalization industry . I know , for example , that more than 50 percent of the 147 million Internet users today are nonEnglish speakers ( according to International Data Corp. ) ; people stay twice as long and are three times as likely to buy from a site in their native language ( Forrester Research ) ; two-thirds of all Web surfers click away from non-native language sites ( Yahoo ) ; and in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese , not English . <p> I then reviewed all 27 " Webby " award-winning sites . There are zero multilingual sites ; there is only one nonEnglish language site ( French ) ; only 20 percent of the sites contain some kind of character set definition telling the browser which language the content is in , thus none of these sites can be easily translated . <p> I thought that the first two " Ws " in " WWW " stood for " worldwide " ? Stupid me . I 'll have to defer to the new WWW guru , Tiffany Shlain , and the other Webbies judges for guidance in the future . <p> The Webbies prove that multiculturalism in the United States is purely one of style over substance and that " globalization " really means " Americanization . " Shame on The Chronicle for providing such extensive coverage of such a globally dishonest and insulting awards ceremony . <p> ULTAN O BROIN <p> San Francisco <p> TAX PLAN DIVISIVE <p> Editor  --  What happened ? Did Gov . Gray Davis have a flashback to his days as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain his bizarre proposal to exempt public school teachers from California 's state income tax . ( " Critics See Davis ' Tax Exempt Plan for Teachers as Noble , but Flawed , " May 15 . ) <p> A principal characteristic of rational tax policy is to treat similar taxpayers equally . If we exempt one class of public employee , why not others ? <p> Moreover , in our democratic society , our main connection to government comes with our status as taxpayers . Teachers are already disconnected enough given that they receive far more in tax revenue than they pay . Davis ' proposal would put a virtual fire wall between teachers  --  as purely tax receivers  --  and the rest of society . This is as unhealthy as it is divisive . <p> The good news is that Democrats and Republicans alike are highly skeptical of the idea . The bad news is that this proposal is consistent with Davis ' continuing drift toward discriminatory and " divide-and-conquer " tax policy . <p> JON COUPAL <p> President , <p> Harvard Jarvis Taxpayers Association <p> Sacramento <p> NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please oppose AB 2295 , the " Smoke-a-Joint , Lose-Your-License " bill recently passed by the Assembly Public Safety Committee to mandate a six-month driver 's license suspension upon conviction of any drug offense . Instead support legislation to officially " opt-out " of this provision . <p> AB 2295 is an irrational extra punishment imposed upon people who have already suffered whatever penalty a judge saw fit to impose on them . This law would clog California 's courts by causing huge numbers of very low-level drug offenders to take their cases to full trial . <p> Write to Sen. Tim Leslie or Assemblyman Rico Oilier and Gov . Davis , all at State Capitol , Sacramento , CA 95814-4905 . <p> CAROL COLBURN <p> Meadow Vista <p> CLEAN DIESEL WORKS <p> Editor  --  Candace Morey of the Union of Concerned Scientists writes that the governor 's budget for new transit buses should only fund alternative fuel buses and goes on to state , incorrectly , that new buses utilizing the latest clean diesel technology are " big polluters . " <p> Recent environmental research has proven that clean diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient engines equipped with catalysts and particulate traps  --  can match natural gas fueled engines for emission reductions . One striking difference , however , is affordability . Clean diesel technology is as much as six times more affordable than conversion to natural gas . That is why the California Air Resources Board 's rules allow urban bus fleet operators the flexibility to select the fuel alternative that best suits local needs . <p> The governor 's proposal is likewise fuel-neutral , wisely emphasizing the need to meet emission reduction standards rather than dictating only one means of achieving them . <p> JEANNE CAIN <p> Sacramento <p> THIS PRIEST NO VICTIM <p> Editor  --  Your article , " Settlement in Bishop Abuse Suit by Priest , " April 25 ) , raises issues that do not " settle " well with me . <p> How does a Roman Catholic priest , who admittedly stole money from his own parish , still remain a priest , and at the same time receive a $535,000 settlement for accusing a former bishop of sexual harassment ? The fact that the Rev. Jorge Salas says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick Zeimann , or else be exposed to police officials for the theft , does not justify his own wrongdoing . If this " priest " were a businessman in the corporate world , he would go to prison . This " settlement " is another word for " stealing " from the Church and its members . I do not see the Rev. Salas as a victim here . <p> CARYLL ELLENWOOD <p> Walnut Creek <p> DOGGONE HEADLINE <p> Editor  --  This is unbelievable ! I can not believe that a story about a trapped dog made it to the front page ! Please , do n't we have better things to cover other than this animal drama ? Here are a few that might have replaced that dog story : U.N . troops being held hostage in Sierra Leone ; impending famine in Ethiopia ; a weak Euro that makes traveling to Europe cheap for Americans ; the strange weather that has plagued the Bay Area this May . The list goes on and on . <p> I am not an animal hater . I had cats in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just can not think of a reason to justify spending all the money and man-power saving one little dog , while there are people suffering , starving and dying everywhere , including here in the Bay Area . <p> At the least , please do not parade this story as headline news . It is as if you are telling the less fortunate that it is better to be a terrier in America than a person in the inner city , or Iraq , or Ethiopia . <p> JINGLI WANG <p> Berkeley <p> REDWOOD REUNION <p> Editor  --  A 40th reunion for the Redwood High School Class of 1960 will be held September 23 at the Harbor Point Racquet &; Beach Club in Tiburon .
