<p> There are times in Hollywood when the kids really are all right . <p> Natalie Portman survived her wonder years in the spotlight without pulling a Lindsay , Britney or Nicole . <p> " I 've had a few drunken nights in my life . I 'm not some sort of Puritan . But I have n't made a lifestyle out of it , " says the actress who is dubbed the new Audrey Hepburn . " There are some people who obviously do make it a lifestyle and they do have a problem . " <p> The 26-year-old native of Israel , who has a degree from Harvard , stars as the manager of a magic toy store in " Mr. Magorium 's Wonder Emporium " opening Friday , and also has a choice part in " The Darjeeling Limited , " already in theaters . <p> In " Mr. Magorium , " Portman plays Molly Mahoney , a composer who dreams of greatness but ca n't seem to write her great work of art . To pay the rent , she works for Mr. Magorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys come alive because magic is in the air . Mr. Magorium knows his days are limited and wants Molly to take over his Wonder Emporium , but she frets the store will die in her hands because she does n't have magic in her . <p> " I just absolutely loved the script , " Portman says . " I got it when I was in Berlin working . The script came in a white box with a red bow on it and a letter from director and writer Zach Helm that was magical . He wrote that he wanted to create something in the pantheon with the roller coaster , boxed juices and Roald Dahl books . He wanted this to be about everything children love . He even made this fantastic list of all the things children love . He aimed to have the script at that level . " <p> Portman also was anxious to work with Dustin Hoffman after a chance meeting the two had years ago . " I met him when I was 16 , " she recalls .

As an actor in a play , you 're always thinking , ' Who is it ? Who will be there ? Are they out there already ? ' You 're always looking for the list of the nightly celebs . <p> " Dustin was different . I remember him just storming backstage and trying to put me on the phone with his son . He was trying to set us up , which was really funny . " <p> She says playing a surrogate daughter to him in " Mr. Magorium " was a dream . <p> " Dustin is really funny . He makes it feel like playing , " Portman says . " He 's always inventing and improvising a lot . He keeps you very spontaneous and keeps the energy going between takes .

It was a joy to work with her as a daughter in this film . " <p> Ask Portman if she ever doubted herself and she laughs . " I think you never really feel like you 're talented , " she says . " I know every time I start a new film I think , ' I 'm not going to be able to do it . ' <p> " The only thing that makes me go forward is I feel like I 've failed before . Actually , I think when you fail at something like work it 's such a lucky thing . No one dies . No one 's feelings are really hurt . It 's not the end of the world and it teaches you that you can fail and survive .

It almost stops you from being cynical and asks you to remember a great toy or a moment that you really could n't explain . " <p> Portman says her mother gave her that sense of magic about the world when she was a little girl . <p> " My mom is one of those people who will peel a grapefruit and say , ' Look at this ! This is an amazing grapefruit ! ' I grew up around someone who was very into the magic of everything . My mom would pick up a leaf and say , ' Look how beautiful this is . Can you believe it even exists ? ' " <p> Portman was born as Natalie Hershlag in Jerusalem , where her father worked as a fertility specialist and her mother was an artist .

Portman received international acclaim for her film debut in " Leon " ( 1994 ) , which was also known to U.S. audiences as " The Professional . " As a young actress , she turned in solid performances in " Heat " ( 1995 ) , " Beautiful Girls " ( 1996 ) , " Mars Attacks " ( 1996 ) and " Cold Mountain " ( 2003 ) . <p> Portman became an icon when George Lucas cast her as the young Queen Amidala in the " Star Wars : Episode I " ( 1999 ) prequel . She starred in two additional prequels , " Star Wars : Episode II  --  Attack of the Clones " ( 2002 ) and " Star Wars : Episode III  --  Revenge of the Sith " ( 2005 ) . <p> In between all that , she managed to attend one of the most prestigious schools in the world , graduating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really imagined not going to college . I do n't know why . I guess that 's the way I grew up . College was a big part of your life and no matter what you got your education , " she says . <p> " Also I think college was a great buffer zone for me between this really sheltered life with my parents and being taken care of by them and going off and being independent . <p> " College is a middle ground . People are still responsible for you and feeding you . They 're making sure you 're not doing bad stuff like never eating a decent meal . But at the same time you have to start doing your own laundry . <p> " You have to make sure you wake up and go to class . You have to actually study and finish your papers . This is a whole new thing because you do n't have your parents nudging you . I 'm spoiled . I had parents who nudged me .

" The worst is I had some great Zac Posen clothes from films and I threw them in hot water and just turned on the washing machine ! Sorry , Zac ! " <p> That 's Natalie Portman , the kind of girl who apologizes for wrecking a $500 shirt . Forget her contemporaries , who might seem perfectly fine with destroying such an extravagant item . <p> " It 's sad in young Hollywood , " Portman says . " A lot of people have serious problems . I just think if you 're an alcoholic , that 's a disease . I hope those people can deal with their stuff . I 'm lucky enough not to have that in my life .

Even back when I was young I could go to clubs with my friends and no one bothered me . " <p> She feels for the young stars who are on the edge . " It 's pretty extreme right now and I 'm sure it 's terrifying for them , " she says . " All that constant attention will throw you over the edge . <p> " I look at the pictures and see a car with one of those young women we wo n't name . There are 50 people around them snapping pictures with flash bulbs bursting in their faces , " Portman says . " How @ @ @ @ @
