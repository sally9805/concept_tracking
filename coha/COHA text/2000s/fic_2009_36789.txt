March 2007 <p> PROLOGUE <p> Death was on her mind , but Jasmine was n't thinking of her own demise . Her hands still trembled as she looked down at the letter she held . <p> Would the charge be first degree murder or would it be more like manslaughter ? Either way , she would go to jail for both before she allowed anyone to reveal this secret . <p> Jasmine read the words that she 'd already memorized : Get your husband to step down from the pulpit or else everyone will know what you did in the summer of 1983 . <p> Hours had passed since she 'd first read the letter last night , and she still trembled . Until a few weeks ago , those days had been totally forgotten ; expunged from her mind many years before . The summer of ' 83 was just a small blip on her life 's radar . A mistake . A secret . <p> But it was a big secret that she 'd kept from everyone  --  including her husband , Pastor Hosea Bush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked her just five months before when they were in Los Angeles . <p> " Are there any other secrets , Jasmine ? Any other lies ? " <p> She 'd told him then every truth she could remember , revealed every lie that she 'd ever told  --  how she was forty-three and not thirty-eight . How she 'd been married before . She 'd even told him how much weight she 'd really gained since she 'd had her baby . She 'd told her husband everything she could think of . <p> But she had n't told him this . <p> " I have to talk to Hosea , " she whispered , remembering the commitment they 'd both made never again to keep secrets . <p> She could tell him  --  convince him  --  that this was something she 'd simply forgotten . But even as she had that thought , she knew that would never happen . There was nothing that would ever make her tell this truth . If Hosea found out about this , she 'd lose more than her husband : Hosea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her . This was an unforgiveable sin ; at least it would be in Hosea 's eyes . <p> No , she would commit murder before she allowed this to come out . No one could ever know that she 'd spent the summer of ' 83 hanging high and swinging low from a pole . <p> No one could ever know that Jasmine Cox Larson Bush , the first lady of New York 's City of Lights at Riverside Church , used to be a stripper ! <p> Copyright 2009 by Victoria Christopher Murray <p> A Few Weeks Before <p> ONE <p> The shocking shrill pierced the black quiet of midnight , but Jasmine had no intention of answering the telephone . <p> " Do n't stop , baby , " Jasmine panted when Hosea lifted his head from beneath the sheet . <p> " Got ta get that , " he gasped . " Might be important . " <p> Jasmine glanced at the clock : 12:17 . She rolled over , closed her eyes , and , in her mind , returned to the place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hosea still knew how to take her straight to heaven . And it was even better now , since he 'd stopped thinking about their having a baby . Once conception was taken out of the equation , only pure pleasure remained . <p> Like tonight . He 'd had her singing praises in seventeen languages.And she still had a few native tongues she wanted to test , so whoever was calling , whatever the reason , it had better be worth interrupting some of the best  --  <p> " What ! " Hosea shouted and clicked on the lamp . " I 'm on my way ! " <p> Jasmine sat up straight . " What 's wrong ? " <p> " Pops ! He 's been shot ! " <p> Tossing aside the satin duvet , Jasmine ignored the shock of the cool air as it wrapped around her nakedness . " Shot ? " She stood stiff as Hosea leapt from the bed and dashed into his closet . <p> " That 's all Brother Hill said , " Hosea yelled back . " He 's at Harlem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released her , and Jasmine ran into her own closet . Her mind swirled with questions as she stuffed herself into a pair of jeans , then grabbed a sweatshirt . Shot ? By whom ? Where ? When ? By the time Hosea stepped from his closet , Jasmine was ready . <p> He said , " You do n't have to go . I 'll call you . " <p> " I 'm going with you . " Her tone said there would be no further discussion . " I 'll check on Jacquie and wake up Mrs. Sloss . " She took two steps , then turned back and held Hosea in her arms . " He 's going to be okay , " she whispered . <p> His eyes shined with fright , but he nodded like he agreed . <p> Taking charge , she said , " Instead of driving , let 's take a cab . I 'll meet you downstairs . " She dashed from their bedroom across to the other side of the apartment and tiptoed into their daughter 's room . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacqueline 's bedroom into a princess 's pink haven . She peeked into the four-poster toddler cot and straightened the comforter that was bunched around Jacqueline 's feet . She kissed her cheek , then knocked on the adjacent door . <p> " Ms. Jasmine , " Mrs. Sloss , their live-in nanny , began the moment she opened the door , " something wrong with Jacquie ? " Her voice was filled with sleep , but her eyes were wide . <p> " No . " Jasmine was already rushing toward the living room . " Hosea 's godfather just called . Someone shot Reverend Bush . " <p> " Oh , no ! " The nanny followed behind her . " Is there anything I can do ? " <p> " Just take care of my baby . " <p> As she waited for the elevator , Jasmine paced and tried to think . But even by the time she ascended to the lobby , she could n't make sense out of this news . <p> " Mr. Bush is waiting for you , " the doorman said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and paused to say a quick prayer . Then she jumped into the waiting cab and they sped off into the midnight quiet of the February night . <p> Their steps echoed like rapid fire through the hospital 's hallway . Jasmine squeezed Hosea 's hand right before they stepped to the nurses ' station . <p> " I 'm here to see  --  " <p> " Hosea ! " <p> When Brother Hill ran up behind them , Jasmine 's eyebrows raised a little at the sight of the man in a jogging suit . She 'd never seen the church deacon without a tie . <p> " Where 's Pops ? " Hosea asked right after he embraced his godfather . <p> " He 's in the Trauma Unit . " With his hand on his shoulder , Brother Hill led Hosea toward a room as if his godson had come alone . <p> Jasmine took a deep breath and followed the two men . It took everything within her not to be upset with the way Brother Hill ignored her . She had to remember that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man she 'd grown to love . <p> But the truth : it was hard not to go off . Taking insults from Brother Hill and his band of bandits  --  the decades-long friends of Reverend Bush who did n't think she was good enough to be Hosea 's wife  --  had become part of her life . These old-timers who 'd known Hosea since his childhood were still holding on to her past ; they 'd never forgotten how Hosea had fallen in love with her while she was secretly sleeping with ( and becoming pregnant by ) another man . And they certainly had n't forgiven her for tricking Hosea into believing he was the father of her unborn child . <p> What was their problem ? If God had forgiven her , and Hosea had forgiven her , and Reverend Bush had forgiven her , who were these people to treat her as if she was some kind of sinner ? <p> The sound of her husband 's voice brought Jasmine back . " So tell me , what happened ? " <p> Brother Hill started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We walked out to the parking lot  --  we 'd been at the church late reviewing the fiscal report and he was still working on his sermon for tomorrow . But when I got to my car , I realized I 'd left my keys . I went back inside , and that 's when I heard the gunshots . By the time I got back to Samuel  --  " He stopped . " The doctors gave us this room so that we could have privacy . " <p> When they stepped inside , Mrs. Whittingham , Reverend Bush 's assistant and one of Brother Hill 's bandits , stood and hugged Hosea . The woman hesitated , then gave Jasmine a loose embrace . Turning back to Hosea , Mrs. Whittingham asked , " How you holding up , baby ? " <p> Hosea 's eyes blinked rapidly . " This does n't make any sense . Why would anyone shoot Pops ? " <p> Mrs. Whittingham said , " Detective Foxx was one of the first policemen there , " she said , referring to one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in the middle of some gang fire . " <p> " How bad is he ? " Jasmine asked . <p> Brother Hill shrugged . " The doctors have n't told us anything . We 've been waiting for  --  here 's one of the doctors now . " <p> Jasmine 's eyebrows rose slightly as the African American woman clothed in surgical scrubs approached . <p> Brother Hill made the introductions . " Doctor McCollors , this is Reverend Bush 's son , Hosea . " <p> Shaking hands , Hosea asked the doctor , " How 's my father ? " <p> " Well , he was shot twice  --  once in his shoulder . But it 's the shot that he took to his head that 's the serious problem . " <p> " Oh , my God ! " Jasmine whispered the words that were spoken by all of them . <p> The doctor continued , " It 's caused a lot of swelling and bleeding . We 're going in to remove some of the pressure . " <p> " I want to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into surgery now . It 'll be a couple of hours . " <p> " Doctor McCollors ? " A policeman , standing outside the room , motioned to the doctor . <p> " Excuse me , " she said , before leaving the foursome standing in stunned silence . <p> Seconds later , the quiet was broken by , " Hosea ! " <p> The high-pitched woman 's voice made Jasmine frown before she swiveled around . She watched Pastor Wyatt , the associate pastor at City of Lights enter the room with a slight woman . The mousy-looking female , whose hair was upturned in a sixties-style flip , handed the tray of drinks she held to the pastor before she rushed to Hosea and wrapped her arms around his waist . <p> " I 'm so sorry , " the woman squeaked over and over . " Ivy ! " Hosea pulled back and , for the first time since they 'd received the call , he smiled a little . " What 're you doing here ? " <p> " I 'm visiting Sarai , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been home in a while and decided to take a sabbatical this semester . I 'm so sorry about your dad , but I 'm glad that I 'm here so that I can help take care of you . " <p> Jasmine cleared her throat and crossed her arms . <p> " Oh , Ivy , you have n't had a chance to meet my wife . This is Jasmine . " <p> The woman smiled , revealing teeth that were far too big for her mouth . <p> " Jasmine , this is Ivy , Mrs. Whittingham 's sister . Ivy and I grew up together . " <p> " It 's so nice to meet you finally , " Ivy said , reaching for Jasmine 's hand . " Sarai told me all about you . " <p> With a quick glance over her shoulder , Jasmine looked at Mrs. Whittingham . If she 'd been talking about her , surely nothing good had been said . <p> Turning back to Ivy , Jasmine said , " I did n't know Mrs. Whittingham had any family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the woman . " You 're her ... sister ? " That was hard to believe  --  Mrs. Whittingham looked like she was twenty , maybe even thirty years older than Ivy . <p> Ivy gave a light chuckle . " People always say that , but she is my sister . " Then she faced Hosea . " Any news about your dad ? " <p> Pastor Wyatt tapped Jasmine 's shoulder . " Would you like one of these ? " he whispered , holding the coffee tray in the air . <p> " No , thank you . " <p> She tried to turn back to Hosea , but Pastor Wyatt held her arm . " You sure ? " His voice was still low , like he did n't want anyone else to hear . " It 's going to be a long night . " <p> Jasmine looked down to where he gripped her arm , then slowly inched her glance back to his face . " I said "  --  she wiggled away from him  --  " no , thank you . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Whittingham and Brother Hill . <p> Jasmine frowned , wondering again about the pastor . It was never what Pastor Wyatt said , it was his flirtatious tone  --  he talked as if neither he nor she were married . <p> " So are you sure you do n't want to share some of this java with me ? " The pastor was back ; he raised the coffee cup to his mouth and grazed the edge of it with his tongue . <p> Jasmine hated herself when she sighed , but how was she supposed to help it ? The man was six feet four inches of pure sex , dangerously tempting with his Terrence Howard looks , his Barry White voice , and his legs that she could imagine ... <p> She snapped out of it , hissed , " How many times do I have to tell you I do n't want any of your coffee ? " <p> He squinted and shrugged as if he had no idea what had brought on her attitude . <p> " Darlin ' , " Hosea called to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jasmine took her husband 's hand , then sat next to him . On the other side , Ivy planted herself in the chair and chatted away as if Hosea was interested in all the details of her life . <p> Across from them , Mrs. Whittingham and Brother Hill were in a whispered conversation . And there was Pastor Wyatt  --  right across from her . When he grinned , the deep dimple in his left cheek winked at her . <p> Twisting so that he was not in her direct view , Jasmine leaned her head on Hosea 's shoulder and closed her eyes . <p> Like Pastor Wyatt had said , this was going to be a long night . <p> Copyright 2009 by Victoria Christopher Murray <br> Library of Congress subject headings for this publication : <br> Bush , Jasmine Larson ( Fictitious character )  --  Fiction . <br> African American women  --  Fiction . <br> Christian women  --  Fiction . <br> New York ( N.Y. )  --  Fiction . <br>                @ @ @ @ @
