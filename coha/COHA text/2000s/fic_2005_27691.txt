Chapter One Sophie LaCroix could n't believe what she had just heard . There was no way Miss Blythe had just announced that the sixth-grade class was going to get to do a Performance Showcase-on the stage-on a Saturday night-in front of a REAL AUDIENCE . And that the top three performing groups would each get a prize . In Sophie 's world , dreams like THAT just did n't come true every day . Sophie 's best friend , Fiona , grabbed her hand and squeezed it until Sophie 's fingers looked like red lipsticks . " Do you think she 'll let us pick our own groups ? " Kitty whispered on the other side of Sophie . Her blue-jay-blue eyes were nearly bulging , the way they always did when she was nervous . Which was a lot . " She would be nonsensical not to , " Fiona whispered back . " We 're the Corn Flakes . " " So ? " That came from their other friend , Maggie , whose voice thudded across the table they shared . " Teachers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blythe , who had her back to them , writing dates and times and requirements on the board with flowing chalk . She was their arts teacher , and Sophie had often thought she could n't be anything else . Miss Blythe was tall and wore long skirts and bracelets that flounced with bright-colored charms . She swayed like a new tree when she walked , the strands ofher waist-length blonde hair streaming down her back as if they were rays of sunlight . With her long fingers constantly punctuating her sentences in the air , Sophie had a hard time imagining her as a lawyer or a greeter down at Wal-Mart . And Sophie could imagine just about anything . Is Miss Blythe the type to let friends-best friends who ca n't bear to be separated-work together ? Sophie thought . Or would she subject her students to pure torture at the hands of girls like the Corn Pops ? They 'd only had arts class for about a month . It was hard to say . " I ca n't work with Julia and them ! " Kitty was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She and B.J. and Anne-Stuart and Willoughby-they would be so mean to me ! " " Yeah , they would torture you , " Maggie said in her usual flat , factual voice . " Any of us . " Sophie could tell by the way Kitty was whimpering that none of that was making her feel any better . It was n't doing much for Sophie , either , for that matter . She shook her acorn-colored hair off her shoulders and adjusted her glasses as she leaned into the table . The rest of the Corn Flakes leaned in with her . " We just have to pray really hard , " she said . " We have to squeeze our eyes shut and whisper to God in our heads . " " That 'll look weird , " Maggie said . Sophie saw that she was on the point of rolling her very dark eyes . Maggie was Cuban , so everything on her was dark except her extra-white teeth . " Corn Flakes are weird , " Fiona told her . " That 's what makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , clutching each other 's hands under the table . Just before she shut hers , Sophie saw the Corn Pops clinging to each other , too , but she was pretty sure they were n't praying . In fact , Sophie wondered if the Corn Pops EVER prayed . What they did do , as far as Sophie could tell , was think they were better than everybody else because they had more money than rock stars and could get their way no matter what . " No matter what " included cheating , lying , gossiping , and teasing people about anything they thought was too weird . And since the Corn Pops considered everything the Corn Flakes did way too weird , Sophie and Maggie and Kitty and Fiona were their favorite targets . At least we used to be , Sophie thought now . Until they got in so much trouble for doing bad stuff and blaming it on us . It was a little bit of a comfort that the Corn Pops would n't dare do anything else to the Corn Flakes , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie knew the Pops had ways of getting away with things that could escape even the really smart teachers . She sure hoped Miss Blythe knew a Pop from a Flake and would n't try to mix them together . It 's pretty easy to see the differences , Sophie thought . The Corn Pops only wanted to be popular-which was why they were Pops-and they would do anything to stay the boss of everybody else in the sixth grade at Great Marsh Elementary , which was where the corn part came from . Sometimes they were so corny in the stuff they did . Sophie squinted her eyes open a little so she could peek at her fellow Flakes . Fiona , with her rich-brown bob that fell over one of her gray eyes . Maggie , so serious and stocky and practical . And Kitty , with her curly ponytail and her little nose that looked like it was made of china . Corn Flakes are corny , too ; that 's what everyone says , Sophie thought , just because we like to make up stories and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what anybody else thinks about that . Once , back when Kitty was still a Pop , the CPs had said Sophie and Fiona were a couple of " flakes . " It was so perfect it had to be their name . After that , the girls who were all into sports were the Wheaties and most of the boys were Fruit Loops . The best part was that all the group names were a secret among the Corn Flakes . " If everyone is awake , I 'll finish explaining the project , " Miss Blythe said . Sophie 's brown eyes sprang open , even though she had n't actually gotten to praying at all . She pulled her elf of a body up as tall as she could in her chair . It would n't be good to be caught daydreaming , or Daddy would take her video camera away from her , and Corn Flake Productions would be no more . That was the deal with her father-stay out of trouble and make nothing less than a B in school and she could keep the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want at least four people to a group , " Miss Blythe said . " And I feel very good about letting you choose your own- " The rest was drowned out by shrieks that bounced off the walls and back again . Even as Sophie was hugging Fiona and hoping Kitty was n't going to spill off her chair into a puddle of relief , she saw that the Corn Pops were every bit as excited . B.J.-the pudgy-faced one with the swingy blonde hair-was whistling through her teeth . Willoughby , of course , was letting out one of her poodle laughs that could set a person 's fillings on edge , and Anne-Stuart was blowing her nose . Anne-Stuart had sinus issues . She was always blowing her nose . Above it all was the Corn Pop Queen Bee , Julia Cummings , tossing her thick , curly auburn hair back from her face and looking as if she had expected nothing else . After all , she always got what she wanted . Even as Sophie watched her , Julia turned to meet her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile that looked as if she 'd selected it from a rack of grins and stuck it onto her face . Sophie had learned that every one of Julia 's smiles had a message to send . This one clearly said , Thank heaven I did n't get stuck with any of you . Sophie smiled back-a real smile . People always told her that her smile was wispy , like a wood fairy 's . Sophie did n't know about that-she just knew that right now , it wiped Julia 's own grin right off her mouth and replaced it with another message , etched into a sneer : Do n't even think about getting a prize , Sophie LaCroix , because we are so going to win . " All right-let 's settle down , " Miss Blythe called out above the din . " Artists are disciplined people-remember that . " She perched on the high stool at the front of the room and began to make periods and commas in the air with her long fingers as she talked . " Each group must discover an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ten minutes at the very most . " One of the Wheaties , a softball-playing girl named Harley , poked her arm into the air . " What kinda stuff can we do ? " she said . Her group all had their foreheads in twists , Sophie noticed . " Anything the audience might enjoy , " Miss Blythe said . Her eyes took on a dreamy look . " You can sing , dance , do gymnastics , present a poem- " That got a couple of snickers from some of the Fruit Loops , but Miss Blythe ignored them . " Think about what gifts and talents the members of your group have and put them together into something fabulous . And remember ... " She arched an eyebrow at the class . " You will be graded not only on the performance itself , but also on how organized you are and how well you are able to work together . " Sophie sighed happily . Maggie would be in charge of organization . Maggie , herself , and Fiona would do the thinking . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always did . " We are so going to have the best one , " Fiona whispered to them . " I want you to meet with your groups now , " Miss Blythe said , curving a comma with her pinkie finger , " and go to work on coming up with an idea . I need to see it in writing by one week from today . That 's next Thursday . If you have nothing by then , I will assign a poem for your group to present . " " She 'll have ours way before next Thursday , " Maggie said . As soon as Miss Blythe punched out the final period with a deep purple fingernail , Maggie got out the Corn Flakes ' purple Treasure Book and the special color-of-the-day gel pen , a shade of pale peach . Fiona got her finger around the strand of hair that hung over her eye and twirled it . Sophie recognized that as her creative thinking pose . Sophie 's was to tuck her way-skinny legs up under her and gaze at the ceiling . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good thing we already know what our talent is . What can we make a film of ? " " Film ? " They all looked up at Miss Blythe , who had stopped beside their table with a swish of her lavender skirt . " That 's what we do , " Fiona told her . " We write scripts and make films out of them . They 're always educational . We do our research and we have costumes and- " " I 'm impressed , " Miss Blythe said . " But you ca n't make a film for the Sixth Grade Showcase . This has to be a live performance . " Then she looked at the Corn Flakes as if they obviously did n't know what art really was and swept off to visit the Wheaties . Kitty 's voice immediately spiraled up into a whine . " But what do we do if we ca n't make a film ? " " Not fair , " Maggie said . " I 'm gon na go talk to her , " Fiona said . But Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else , " she said . " I get in trouble when I argue with teachers . " Fiona plucked at her little bunch of a mouth with her fingers . " Let 's go around the table and everybody say what their talent is-besides making films . " For a long moment , nobody said anything . Finally Fiona snapped her fingers . " I used to take ballet , " she said . " When ? " Maggie said . " When I was five . Only my parents had to take me out because the teacher did n't like me . I kept correcting the way she was pronouncing the positions . She was saying everything wrong . " Maggie had the peach pen poised over the blank page . " So Fiona can dance , but I ca n't . " " Me neither , " Sophie said . Kitty shook her head . " Next , " Maggie said . " I can make costumes , period . " " And you 're the best at it , " Sophie said . " Whatever we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Maggie jotted that down and then looked at Kitty . " Me ? " Kitty said . " I can play the piano . Except the only song I know is ' You Ai n't Nothin ' But a Hound Dog . ' My grandma taught me it . She says it 's a classic . " " You know my talent , " Sophie said . " I imagine things . " " So what are you imagining right now , Soph ? " Fiona said . " Oh , no , " Kitty whispered suddenly . Sophie followed with her eyes to where Kitty was pointing . All the Corn Pops were squealing up to Miss Blythe 's desk , and Anne-Stuart was waving around a piece of paper , which she floated down in front of Miss B. " They could n't have their idea written up already , " Maggie said . She glanced at the wall clock . " It 's impossible . " Fiona narrowed her eyes into little points . " They probably cheated . " " Class ! " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exclamation point . " Julia 's group has already come up with a marvelous idea ! They are going to perform a dance with costumes . Does n't that sound fabulous ? " " Fabulous , " said some Fruit Loop in a bored voice . " Okay , Flakes , " Fiona hissed between her teeth . " Everybody has to come up with at least one idea by tomorrow morning-even if it 's lame . " Maggie wrote that down , too . " I know your idea wo n't just be average brilliant , " Fiona said to Sophie . " Yours will be scathingly brilliant . " " Oh , by the way- " That was Anne-Stuart 's voice , coming out of her always-stuffy nose . " We are going to need one more dancer . If you are interested in being in our spectacular production , see me and we will set up an audition for you . " Sophie pulled her Corn Flakes in around her with a spread of her arms . " I 'm glad none of us can dance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , right ? " They all agreed that they would . Always . Chapter Two Sophie could hardly keep her mind on math and science in Mrs. Utley 's classes that afternoon , and for once it was n't because she was imagining herself as Antoinette the French heroine , or Dr. Demetria Diggerty the archaeologist , or Astronaut Stella Stratos . All she could think about was what on earth the Corn Flakes were going to do with one under-trained ballerina and a piano player who could only clunk out some old song about a dog . She was trying to picture how they could get Fiona 's talent for using big words in there , when she heard Fiona coughing . That was the signal that Sophie was in danger of being caught flitting into Sophie World instead of multiplying numbers with decimals . When she looked up , Fiona was jerking her head toward the Corn Pops . They had their math books open , but their pencils were scrawling out the notes they were passing to each other . Probably more ideas for their " spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to see Dr. Peter today . I know he can help . Dr. Peter was Sophie 's therapist-her sister , Lacie , still said he was her psychiatrist , even though he wasn't-and one of her favorite people in the galaxy . He was the one who had made it so she could have her camera and make better grades and have real friends . If it were n't for him , Sophie knew she would still be thinking Daddy did n't love her as much as he did Lacie and Zeke . Mama was in front of the school in the Suburban to pick her up after her last class and take her to Hampton where Dr. Peter had his office . As usual , Sophie 's five-year-old brother , Zeke , was in the backseat , yacking his head off . " I liked it better when we went to Dr. Peter every week , " he said to Sophie , instead of hello . " We ? " Mama said . Continues ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
