When do you begin traveling ? When your airplane lifts oft " the ground ? When you leave your house for the road ? When you pack ? When the plan first comes to mind ? When you admit to how restless and ill at ease , even murderous , you feel at home ? When you take your first steps ? When you emerge from the womb ? And what is love ? Do you know what that is ? Could it be the opposite of traveling ? And if so , then what is hate ? <p> You could n't ask these questions , no matter how ferociously they burned in your mind , of a man in wool products , could you ? <p> Wool products . Avery 's seatmate had spent his life in wool products . Not surprising , since the balding , pale-faced old fellow had grown up in a country of forty million sheep . The man informed him before takeoff in Los Angeles that he had been visiting his daughter who lived in Nevada , married to a casino manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What odds ! How fortunate , his little girl , born in the faraway island nation toward which they would be flying all night , to have met a man at college who emigrated to the U.S. and went into the gaming business . <p> The wool-man puffed foul animal breath into the air between them as he spoke . But Avery could n't help but listen . <p> " All of us Kiwis know we have to travel out , because nobody 's ever coming here , we 're so far away from everything else . Kids these days call it the O.E. Overseas Experience . My generation , we called it going to war . Because that 's where we went . " <p> The wool-man talked on into the first hours of the flight , leaving Avery hardly any room to tell his own story . Which was just as well . He became quite interested in the red wine served by the tidily efficient flight attendants . After a while the wool-man slept , leaving Avery with no ear but his own mind 's ear and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman who leaves you for your younger brother . <p> So the night flight passed for him in a haze of dozing and drinking . Eventually they descended through fog and rain and touched down on the tarmac in Auckland . <p> The wool-man sat up , suddenly awake and alert . <p> " You 'll be driving , then , mate ? " <p> Avery nodded , and the wool-man tapped him on the shoulder . <p> " Do n't forget , keep to the left . " <p> And then he was traveling again , in his rental car , in a light rain-early summer , it was down here-keeping to the leftSTAY LEFT , STAY ALIVE , said the sticker in the lower right-hand corner of the driver's-side front window-powered by his own juices of anger , regret , astonishment , yearning , regret ( a lot of regret ) , and ( more anger transformed into ) fury . <p> Four hours to the Opua ferry , or so stated his map purchased weeks before in a small bookshop in Marin . He was grateful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was summer in the Antipodes , and summer meant warm sun , few clouds-so that about two hours north of the city limits he could pull over onto the side of the road , heavenly jade-green hills and clouds white as sheep abounding , and close his eyes . Oh , woolman ! Bah-bah , so many white sheep ! <p> And then he was driving again , noticing signs for Wellsford , then Maungaturoto , then Waipu . The exotic names conjured up a lost time , a lost place , imaginary locations in stories their father had read to them when they were children . When the sun did appear at last as he approached a town called Whangarei , he found green ocean and dark distant islands to his right , hills with giant palm ferns on his left . And he stayed to the left of the road- <p> Now , at last , a notice for the ferry-Opua , 2 km. - with the glint of sun on the narrow neck of the Bay of Islands , a smooth ride on the ten-car auto-ferry , twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But not for long . Up a hill , round a leafy curve , a few more turns , and he was gliding , exhausted , into the water-side village of Russell , where he planned-it was the only plan he had made after deciding to come all this distance to get away-to celebrate New Year 's Eve by himself . <p> Which would turn out to be a quiet event under the management of Kip and Mary Perkins , owners and managers of Kauri Tops , the lodging Avery had secured at the last minute from a rather disinterested travel agent in Marin . He had asked for a trip to somewhere as far away as possible where he still might speak English and a place to stay that was comfortable and private , something low-key , none of these sports and hiking lodges he had read about in the brochures , and that was what he got , a small , sparely furnished room in a light-drenched house of three stories built up onto the side of a hill overlooking the Bay of Islands . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solo meal of roast game-fish-employing the conventional wisdom , he had predicted lamb , and flunked-in the pleasant dining room on the second floor of the lodge , Avery retired to his room and wrapped himself in his jet-lag , which was considerable after the fourteen-hour flight from Los Angeles and his several hours in the car driving north . <p> Of course he lay awake , imagining his wife in his brother 's arms , her mouth on his genitals , his brother staring wall-eyed-he was ugly from birth and would remain ugly in memory , as long as Avery lived-at whatever ceiling beneath which they performed these pernicious acts . In a break from his pornographic self-torture , Avery recalled an incident in which he and Nicholas had been burning garbage in a field near their old house in Jersey when they were both quite young , deciding that he should have set the slightly younger brother on fire and left him to die . Oh , my God , he writhed and moaned in his bed . This was worse than he ever could have imagined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the worst remained at home in his own mind ! Time was all screwed up . Light splashed across the windows , and he fell finally into a deep sleep until late afternoon . <p> At first he tried to lose himself in the plans for the evening . His hosts were going to make a New Year 's Eve meal that would be entirely organic . Did n't that sound swell ? <p> " My brother 's always teased me about my eating habits , " he said to his hosts on his way out the door for a walk . ( Stop talking about him ! he chided himself . ) But he could hear the bastard 's voice in his ear , so close it burned the hairs-heat surged up along his arms , converging in his chest in a great unsounded roar of anger and spite . He 'd like to cut Nicholas into bloody chunks of meat and serve them up to Carrie in a beautiful adulterer 's stew . <p> He excused himself so that he might take his walk . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kip Perkins said . " Head down along the Strand . The water 's lovely . " And to Avery 's back as he went out the door , said , " If you 'd like to take a longer hike tomorrow , I 'll be happy to take you on a tour of the Kauri trees in the forest near Mangamuka to celebrate the New Year . " <p> Celebrate ? Avery did n't turn around . Rude , he knew , but he did n't want Perkins to see his face , growing darker and darker with anger , hate , humiliation , and some emotions he had n't yet found a name for playing across his mouth and lips and making his eyes burn . <p> By the time he reached the bottom of the hill and walked some distance along the paved path that curved around at the water 's edge , some of his anger had dissipated . The curtain of the sky , bleached white near the horizon line , rose above the village of Paihia just across the stretch of water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near-greens . Evening was drawing near , and he felt something more than jet-lag . Soul-lag , he wanted to call it . <p> Nothing helped with it . Opua ... He said the word aloud , enjoying the foreign deliciousness of the vowels . Paihia . Kerekeri . He was a wimp that way , he admitted it , a former Marine who loved language . <p> A light breeze blew in off the waters . The top of the hill behind the town lay in early darkness , a few large thunderheads vaulted across the Bay . Voices echoed along the Strand , families closing ranks together in the warm dark . A few men laughed sharply , pulling their beers closer to their lips . Down the way a small dock shimmered in its legacy of bulbs and breeze . A restaurant with a few tables glowing white in the fading light-and a sign above it-Kamakura . In the west a last faint remainder of the day slid behind clouds like a wholeness that in its essence was loose and liquid , an egg-yoke sliding off a plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the thought that an ocean lay a short distance in that direction . To the north , clouds tamping down thoughts of light . To the south , the path leading him back to his lodging . <p> Avery-a man going in every direction at once , and nowhere , at the same time . <p> The back patio of the lodge was strewn with lights , and a small group ( of guests , he presumed , though they had not been at his solitary dinner of the evening before ) hovered around the goldfish pond . <p> " A Kiwi tradition , " said his host upon seeing him approach . <p> " Is it really Kiwi ? " his wife spoke up . " I thought it was Chinese . " <p> " Bloody Chinese , " said one of the other guests . " It 's all them right now , is n't it ? " <p> " They 're a bit bigger than us , are n't they , then ? " said Kip , not just playing host but being a true host . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were none among them ) , Americans ( of whom Avery was the only representative ) , Germans ( a couple who had sat quietly cooing at each other at dinner , so obviously in love they were either on their honeymoon or very good actors ) . Kip made Avery feel welcome , though there was something about his manner that was a bit too effeminate for his taste . <p> A cry went up around the pond as Kip Perkins released a pail full of goldfish into the water . <p> " One for each of you ! " he announced . " Now you each have a fish , and one New Year 's wish to make on it . " <p> Avery shivered slightly as a cool breeze blew up the hill from the bay . The shape of the shoreline across the water glittered with trembling lights , so many you would think this remote location , Russell , Bay of Islands , North Island , New Zealand , surrounded by the South Pacific and the Tasman Sea , might be somewhat near the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come around to him while he had been standing there , thinking . <p> " Classified , " Avery said . <p> " Of course , of course , " Kip said . " Just making sure you made one . " <p> " I did , " Avery said . But he was lying . And so he now went through a skein of wishes in his mind right then and there , from Carrie 's sorrow to his brother 's murder to more calming thoughts of finding some kind of peace and resolution over the next few weeks while he traveled . His goldfish would certainly die from the terrible burden he placed on it . <p> Kiwi dreams . Afterwards , that 's how he would think of them . But while he spent his second night here in flux , he put no name to it , only ran and swam and flew-uh-huh ! - in classic Freudian fashion , which he had never experienced before , only read about in his one aborted term of graduate school when he 'd been waiting to be shipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> A few fleeting faces of people he did n't recognize , but no her , no him , a rush of air , over seas , waterfalls , great caverns , Fingel 's Cave , waves lapping , sea birds ' wings outstretched . <p> Big man , he woke in the night crying . <p> But in the morning he sat up feeling rested . Perhaps his jet-lag had flown ? Good , good . <p> Still , while he took a shower and shaved and dressed , he mourned , he mourned the marriage , mourned for himself . <p> You do n't just <p> No , you do n't ! <p> But you can try , goddamn it ! You can try ! <p> Twisting , twisting about under the showerhead , hoping to wash all , everything , away . <p> He stared down at the drain , which ran clockwise-everything turned around down here in the Antipodes . <p> He had missed breakfast , but so what ? The thought of all that food turning to shit inside him turned his stomach . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two for some sun salutations-Carrie 's influence-in front of the window . Where was he going ? Where had he been ? Sunlight on the water sharpened his glance when he started to long for some sense , some hope , made him blink with overexcitation of the eye . He could n't move . He must n't think . <p> A sharp rap at the door . <p> " Onward to the Kauri forest , " Kip Perkins said as they climbed into the Kiwi 's little Ford . <p> For the first half-hour after the ferry , they drove along a smooth paved two-lane highway , and then took a gravel side road that after a while became rutted dirt . Kip talked more than Avery had bargained for . Turned out he had served in Kuwait , and beyond-Arabs , sand , oil fires , bodies on fire . Avery kept quiet , observing the countryside thick with sheep ( he thought of the wool-man ) , a few cows , a farmhouse here and there . <p> " I grew up in the city- " Auckland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is still new to me . We 've only been here a few years . Military 's behind me . I 'm into conservation now . " <p> " Sounds like a good idea , " Avery said , wishing he held as much of the conviction as his host . <p> Suddenly they stopped , and for an instant Avery was sure they had run something over . But Kip pulled the car onto the shoulder alongside a couple of other vehicles and climbed out . <p> Avery followed . <p> " We 're here ? " <p> " Just a tramp across that field , " Kip said , pointing beyond the road . <p> Across the road and up and over a stile and across an uneven meadow mined with sheep flop Avery might have thought to have been in Vermont or Kansas somewhere until he spied a flock of large birds with sooty wings , bright blue underparts , large bright red bills strutting past with jerky heads . <p> " What ? " he said . <p> " Pukekos , " Kip said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Avery repeated . <p> " Now you 're talking Kiwi , mate , " Kip said . <p> To his new vocabulary , built with Kip 's instruction as they climbed over another stile and walked toward a spreading forest wall about a half mile away , Avery added Kokako , the name of a variety of native crow , a grayish bird with blue wattles at its throat that made bell-like calls of descending pitch as it skirted midway through the distance between them and the trees , and some other names of grasses and low shrubs . <p> There were a few other new birds . But the Kauris awaited him after one more stile . <p> " See them ? " Kip spoke with almost parental pride . " The leafy branches that make up the upper roof of the forest ? " <p> Yes , Kip saw them , the tallest trees riding above an already substantial canopy , and then had to lower his head and watch his step as they descended into a small draw and moved forward and up a few feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From spiking sunlight to the rippling shade as if walking underwater-in a couple of steps they had transformed their surroundings . His breathing , slightly elevated from the tramp across the fields , now seemed tied to the stippled shadowing made by the big trees on the other smaller trees , made by the leafy ferns on his arms and trouser legs . <p> " You see these ? " <p> Avery followed his glance . <p> " These ferns are the signature of our little country . This is called Ponga . And here 's Rahurahu ... " <p> " Rahurahu , " Avery said after him . <p> " Yis , this , and this ? Para . " Kip fondled a small fern growing in profusion at the base of a large tree . It was like watching a parent with a very young child . " And here is Piupiu ... " <p> " Sure , " Avery said , " I knew that , " and found himself laughing for the first time in a long while . " Piupiu . Kids must have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have kids ? " Kip said , leading him past the immediate curtain of trees . <p> " No , never did , " Avery said . " And that looks like a good thing , now . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " Now that I 'm ... we 're getting a divorce . " <p> " Well , this , I did that once . When I came back from the service , it all seemed to have gone wrong . " <p> " Something like that , " Avery said . <p> " And you ca n't salvage it ? You 're down here now , with plenty of time to think . Perhaps there 's a way . Time may work it out . It did for me . " <p> Avery shook his head , meaning , I ca n't talk about it . <p> " Sorry , mate , " Kip said as he led Avery along a muddy trail that wound among the trunks of what turned out to be the very Kauri trees they had come to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here they are . Look how big around . " <p> Nothing a man or even two or three men could hug , the trees were that huge . <p> " Like sequoias , " Avery said , tilting his chin up to get a glimpse of the upper story of trunk and underside of leaf . <p> " Older , I think , " Kip said . " Two thousand to four thousand years old , these are . When even the Maori were just glints in the eyes of their forebears , and white men were still black-just a joke , of course , mate-these trunks were shooting up out of the ground . " <p> Kip pointed to a large gash at the base of one of the Kauris. " see here ? Used to be my great-grandfather 's generation would tap them for the resin gum . Use it in various ways , mostly for varnishes . But digging it this way kills the tree . " <p> Avery leaned forward and studied the crude slash into the trunk that was underlined by a frozen skein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly he pulled himself upright and turned away . <p> " Nasty , this , " Kip said . " We 're trying to save them , these lovely old Kauris . All of this is preserved now . Even working with the local Maori village , though some of the younger people there do n't like that . " <p> " Why not ? " Avery tried to become interested in the problem . <p> " Oh , they 're pissed off at the world . Call the older folks sell-outs . It 's not paradise here , you know , mate . Or perhaps I should say , even in paradise we have factions . " <p> In this forest there should have been bird cries to mask the silence that Avery fell into as he thought about what his host and guide had just said , but oddly enough not many birds sang here . <p> He asked about that . <p> " Well , well , " Kip said . " It 's a major question . And a large part of what I just said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbits , and then ferrets to kill the rabbits and then possums to kill the ferrets . And now the poisoning of the forest to kill the possums . <p> Avery shook his head , meaning , I ca n't take all this in right now . <p> " You 're poisoning the forest , deliberately ? " <p> " Yis , this , we are . Listen . " <p> Avery stood stock-still and settled in his body , trying to listen with as much seriousness as his guide . He heard his own heart beat , he heard leaves twirling in a light breeze overhead . <p> Aside from that , silence . Settled . Beneath the giant Kauris , half a world away from all his troubles . All the poison laid here , it had destroyed the undersounds of animal life-rat and rabbit and weasel and possum . <p> And then sound returned in the form of a red-muscled dog-tongue lolling , red penis slung underneath red back like a fleshy missile ready to be launched , a feathery spray of fur at its rude tip-bounding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antenna of some odd machine . <p> Avery flinched . <p> " It 's all right , " Kip said . " It 's Jimmy 's Bone . " <p> Avery turned to see nothing but the trail , along which the fast-moving dog had already disappeared . <p> After a moment , Kip said , " Here 's Jimmy , now , " and out of the forest burst a burly , moon-faced fellow , with bullet-shaped shaven head , in dun-colored shorts , his thick legs bearing long , deep scratches , as though the dog had tried to tell him something of terrible urgency and had only one way to make himself known . <p> " G'day , " the fellow said , locking eyes with Avery . <p> " Hey , " Avery said . <p> " Jimmy 's on the job , " Kip said . " Laying the poison . Any luck today , Jim ? " <p> " Good bunch of rats , " the man said . " Trapped maybe six of ' em . " He hunkered down at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree knots , his shorts riding up over his bolethick thighs . <p> " The rats eat the birds ' eggs , " Kip said . " You noticed the silence . " <p> " I did , " Avery said . <p> " All these vermin , they eat the eggs , " the trapper said . <p> Avery found himself staring at the gashes in the red man 's beefy legs . <p> " Tough work ? " <p> " Oh , this , " the man said , " I 'm out here every day , rain or sun , summer , winter . It 's like the record Rust Never Sleeps ? These vermin , they 're copulating all the time , and if we do n't stop ' em they 'll take over the island . " He gave Avery something approximating a smile and pulled himself upright . He seemed taller than before he had hunkered down . " And now I got to be moving . " <p> With a nod to Kip and a wink at Avery-odd , the assumed intimacy of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of his dog . <p> Avery was still staring at the space he had occupied when Kip beckoned . <p> " Got more trees to see , mate , " he said . <p> Avery did n't pay much attention to the forest after that , drifting along the path behind Kip for another hour or so , retracing their steps through the green wood and then stumbling back up the hill to the pasture , recrossing the stiles , strutting pukekos all around , returning to the car , returning to the lodge . <p> He excused himself immediately , climbing the stairs to his room . Up there he lay on his back and studied the off-white ceiling and now and then turned to gaze out across the neck of the bay . His jet-lag had waned , but he felt a heaviness in muscle and bone unlike anything he had ever suffered before . <p> Out he went , to dream of nothing . <p> After dinner , feeling more like himself , he adjourned to a small closet turned office on the ground floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of toilet paper used the management 's laptop to send an e-mail back to the States . <p> Carrie , he wrote from where he sat before the screen , what is it that you want from me ? You fucking whore ! <p> And then he deleted the message . <p> He felt an attack of chills , rapid trembling that went on for several minutes as though he were wired to an electrical outlet . Sitting there at the keyboard , he hunched forward and shook , and shook . His teeth chattered . When the shaking subsided he sat a moment and then wrote his brother 's address and the following : <p> What you did ... unforgivable ... you god-sucking wretch of a human being ! <p> And again , he deleted . <p> What hunkered in the corner of his thoughts after he returned to his room and lay there staring out at the lights beyond the balcony , the flickering stars , the appointed streetlamps of Paihia across the water at this narrow neck of the bay ? Memories of childhood-rough bangs on the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and in surprise at the violence from the man she had believed to have been at first so kind-the thing about thought , Avery surmised with such coolness and rationality as he swung his feet back onto the floor and took a good stance at the window , is that it allows you to range so far and wide . One instant , he was a child , the next he could see himself alone and with muscles withered in old age-alone . <p> He slid open the glass door to his balcony and stepped outside . Without the partition between him and the night , the lights , oddly , glinted and glimmered all the more . Here he was , nowhere , and everywhere , and he decided he wanted a drink . <p> Easy to leave the lodge , the stairs , the halls silent . Within two minutes he hit the Strand , where he had first wandered upon his arrival , and it immediately became apparent , amid all the shuttered dark shop fronts , that the only place that offered any haven gave off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue neon . <p> He opened the door and went inside the brightly lit restaurant . <p> A mahogany-skinned man behind the bar looked up in surprise . <p> " We 're closed , sorry . I thought I 'd locked the door . " <p> He reached for something under the bar . Out went the ceiling lights , leaving the place in the same blue-glow as the sign outside . <p> " I do n't want to eat , " Avery said . " Just a quick drink . " <p> The man hesitated , and then said , " Well , since you 're inside already , I suppose we can do it . Long as you do n't kip to the authorities . " In the odd shadow and light , his mouth moved like a dark wound . <p> " Do I look like a guy who would do that ? " <p> Avery blinked , trying to accustom his eyes to the blue glow . <p> " American , are you ? " <p> " Through and through , " Avery said , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He stepped up to the bar , the blue giving his hands and shirt an odd appearance . The man beneath the light , which glowed from the eye of a large mounted fish-deep-sea variety , long sword , spiny dorsal fin-appeared to be half Avery 's age , and his white apron glowed blue-white as though under black light . <p> " Rick Manning , " he said . " I 'm the proprietor . " <p> " Avery . " <p> He offered a hand , but the proprietor demurred . <p> " Sorry , mate , I 'm just still washing off the fish . " <p> A call from behind the swinging doors that led to the kitchen . <p> " Rick ? " <p> " Hold on , love , " the proprietor called back . " So , " he said , turning back to Avery , " where you from ? " <p> Avery told him . <p> " That 's a long way . " <p> " Yeah , feels like it . " <p> The proprietor held up a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " True to our tradition , nothing but the best from home , " the proprietor said . He moved his hands beneath the bar , and Avery could hear the liquid pouring . <p> " Rick , darling ? " <p> A girl poked her head out from the kitchen doors . In the bluelight her mouth appeared black also . <p> " Got a customer , love , " the proprietor said . <p> " I thought we were closed . " <p> Dark oval of a mouth made words in the blue . <p> " A tardy American , " the proprietor said . <p> " One last drop of the coin in the register , eh ? " the girl said . " I thought you were Maori , not a Jew . " <p> In the kitchen behind her , a dog barked , and Avery nearly jumped out of his skin . <p> " Oh , " said the proprietor with a laugh , " tomorrow 's dinner . No , no , just joking . Friend of mine has a dog . Against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of there in a second . You wo n't say anything , will you ? " He tapped his finger against the glass . <p> " I 'm just passing through , " Avery said . <p> " Good , well , then , have your drink . " He slid the glass toward Avery the way a barker might in a shell game . <p> Avery picked up the glass , his eye on the kitchen door . <p> " We 're having dog fish tomorrow , " the proprietor said . <p> Avery remained quiet , sipping the fiery liquid . <p> " Or tree dog . Something to do with its bark . " <p> Avery shook his head . <p> The kitchen door swung open again , and the girl popped out . <p> " Not ready yet ? " <p> " I 'm ready , " Avery said . <p> " Oh , you are ? " said the girl . <p> " For another , " Avery said . <p> " One more , " the proprietor said . " Then we 're closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured , gave it back . <p> This time Avery drank rather than sipped . <p> " Closed now , " said the proprietor . <p> The girl played with the top button of her blouse . <p> " Got to get him out of there . " <p> The proprietor leaned toward Avery and said , " Do n't mean you , mate . " He turned to the girl . " Just tell him . " <p> " I told him . " <p> " Tell him again . " <p> " Jimmy ? " the girl called over her shoulder , holding open the kitchen door . <p> " Here I come , " said a voice from within . <p> Out of the kitchen stepped Jimmy the trapper , his shaven skull glowing blue in the blue light . <p> " Allo , " he said . <p> Avery shook his head . <p> " We just met over in the Kauri forest this afternoon .

" He reached down under the bar and came up with a large bottle , sliding it along the surface to the trapper , who in that moment came striding up to retrieve it . <p> " Got a cigarette ? " <p> He had been watching the trapper , so that when the girl appeared at Avery 's shoulder it seemed as if by magic . Up close , he discovered her slender arms , slightly bowed back , a regular face . She had an appealing scent , something like sandalwood . He had about two seconds to consider what it might be like to pull her close to him and kiss her on that black hole of a mouth before Jimmy clapped his hands , the dog barked in joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , folding his arms across his muscled chest . <p> " We 're off now , " he said . " Tomorrow 's another day for vermin . " <p> " Always knew you were off , " the proprietor said . <p> Jimmy the trapper guffawed as he grabbed the girl 's hand and led her to the door . <p> " Guess I 'd better go , too , " Avery said , setting his glass back on the bar . <p> The proprietor gave him a poignant look-or was it a sense of an invitation delayed or decided against ? - and then a nod of affirmation . <p> " Best thing , " he said , as if he knew something about Avery 's fate-or at least something about his present life-that Avery had n't yet figured . <p> Which could have been anything . <p> A few moments later back out on the dark empty Strand , Avery felt quite untangled and undone . No sound but a flag flapping lightly in the night breeze off the water . He walked a few steps back toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other direction , toward a small pier identified only by a single light bulb against the dark blotter of the bay . <p> Vermin . Kauris . Black hole of a mouth . The horror of his old home life . It was summer here , but he shivered nonetheless , thinking of the trapper 's scarred calves and thighs , his shaven head , and what he would like to do to his brother if-and when-he saw him again . <p> Yes , to be reminded of this was awful , though more awful was to remember that he had nearly forgotten . <p> Perhaps that was the nature of this place-Russell , Bay of Islands , North Island , New Zealand , 35 North , 174 West-so far from everything that it was almost back around again and near . <p> Against the dark all-velvet water where it merged , just above the pinpricks of lights and lamps across the bay , his thoughts rose , the globe shrunk to the size of a human head , and he was nowhere , and everywhere , beginning and ending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 174 West . Big man that he was , he felt as though he might swoon .
