Johnny learned early . If somebody asked him why he was so different , why he held himself so still and why his eyes seemed to swallow light , that 's what he 'd tell them . He learned early that there was no safe place , not the backyard or the playground , not the front porch or the quiet road that grazed the edge of town . No safe place , and no one to protect you . <p> Childhood was illusion . <p> He 'd been up for an hour , waiting for the night sounds to fade , for the sun to slide close enough to call it morning . It was Monday , still dark , but Johnny rarely slept . He woke to patrol dark windows . He rattled the locks twice a night , watched the empty road and the dirt drive that looked like chalk when the moon rose . He checked on his mom , except when Ken was at the house . Ken had a temper and wore a large gold ring that made perfect oval bruises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a T-shirt and frayed jeans , then walked to the bedroom door and cracked it . Light spilled down the narrow hall , and the air felt used up . He smelled cigarettes and spilled liquor that was probably bourbon . For an instant , Johnny recalled the way mornings used to smell , eggs and coffee and the sharp tang of his father 's aftershave . It was a good memory , so he drove it down , crushed it . It only made things harder . <p> In the hall , shag carpet rose stiff under his toes . The door to his mother 's room hung loose in its frame . It was hollow core and unpainted , a mismatch . The original door lay splintered in the backyard , kicked off its hinges a month back when Ken and Johnny 's mother got into it after hours . She never said what the argument was about , but Johnny guessed it had something to do with him . A year ago , Ken could never have gotten close to a woman like her , and Johnny never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . A lifetime . <p> They 'd known Ken for years , or thought they had . Johnny 's dad was a contractor , and Ken built whole neighborhoods . They worked well together because Johnny 's dad was fast and competent , and because Ken was smart enough to respect him . Because of that , Ken had always been pleasant and mindful , even after the kidnapping , right up until Johnny 's dad decided that grief and guilt were too much to bear . But after his dad left , the respect disappeared , and Ken started coming around a lot . Now he ran things . He kept Johnny 's mother dependent and alone , kept her medicated or drunk . He told her what to do and she did it . Cook a steak . Go to the bedroom . Lock the door . <p> Johnny took it in with those black eyes , and often found himself in the kitchen , at night , three fingers on the big knife in its wooden block , picturing the soft place above Ken 's chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pure and simple ; and Johnny 's mother had faded down to nothing . She weighed less than a hundred pounds and was as drawn as a shut-in , but Johnny saw the way men looked at her , the way Ken got possessive when she made it out of the house . Her skin , though pale , was flawless , her eyes large and deep and wounded . She was thirty-three , and looked like an angel would look if there was such a thing , dark-haired and fragile and unearthly . Men stopped what they were doing when she walked into a room . They stared as if a glow came off her skin , as if she might rise from the ground at any moment . <p> She could not care less . Even before her daughter vanished , she 'd paid little attention to the way she 'd looked . Blue jeans and T-shirts . Ponytails and occasional makeup . Her world had been a small , perfect place where she 'd loved her husband and her children , where she 'd tended a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy days ; but no more . Now there was silence and emptiness and pain , a flicker of the person she 'd been ; but the beauty lingered . Johnny saw it every day , and every day he cursed the perfection that graced her so completely . If she were ugly , Ken would have no use for her . If she 'd had ugly children , his sister would still sleep in the room next to his . But she was like a doll or something not quite real , like she should be in a cabinet with a lock on it . She was the most beautiful person Johnny had ever known , and he hated that about her . <p> Hated it . <p> That 's how much his life had changed . <p> Johnny studied the door to his mother 's room . Maybe Ken was in there , maybe not . His ear pressed against the wood , and breath caught in his throat . Normally , he could tell , but sleep had dodged him for days , and when he finally crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he did wake , it was with a start , like he 'd heard glass break . That was at three o'clock . <p> He stepped back from the door , uncertain , then crept down the hall , and the bathroom light hummed when he flicked the switch . The medicine cabinet stood open and he saw the pills : Xanax , Prozac , some blue ones , some yellows . He picked up a bottle and read the label . Vicodin . That was new . The Xanax bottle was open , pills on the counter , and Johnny felt the anger fill him up . The Xanax helped Ken come down after a night with the good stuff . <p> That was his term . <p> The good stuff . <p> Johnny closed the bottle and walked out of the bathroom . <p> The house was a dump , and he reminded himself that it was not really theirs . Their real house was clean and kept up . It had a new roof that he 'd helped to install . He 'd gone up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dad , and held nails in a tool belt that had his name scratched into it . It was a good house , with stone walls and a yard that boasted more than dirt and broadleaf weed . It was only a few miles away , but felt farther , a different neighborhood with cared-for homes on big , green lots . The place was steeped in memory , but the bank owned it now . They gave his mother some papers and put a sign in the yard . <p> This was one of Ken 's rentals . He had about a hundred , and Johnny thought this was probably the worst , a crappy dump way out on the edge of town . The kitchen was small , with green metal and scuffed linoleum that turned up in the corners . A bulb burned above the stove and Johnny turned a slow circle . The place was disgusting : butts in a saucer , empty bottles , and shot glasses . The mirror lay flat on the kitchen table and Johnny saw how white powder residue caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . A rolled-up hundred dollar bill had fallen to the floor . Johnny picked it up , smoothed it out . He 'd not had a decent meal in a week and Ken was snorting coke with a hundred . <p> He picked up the mirror , wiped it off with a wet towel , and hung it back on the wall . His father used to look in that mirror , and Johnny could still see how he worked at his tie on Sundays , his fingers large and stiff , the tie unforgiving . He only wore his suit for church , and he 'd get embarrassed when he caught his son watching . Johnny could see it : the sudden red flush and then the reckless smile . " Thank God for your mother , " he 'd say , and then she 'd tie the knot for him . <p> His hands at the small of her back . <p> The kiss and the wink that came after . <p> Johnny wiped the mirror again , then straightened it , tweaked it until it hung just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly , and Johnny walked out into the damp , dark morning . A streetlamp flickered fifty yards down the road . Headlights crested a distant hill . <p> Ken 's car was gone , and Johnny felt a shameful , sweet relief . Ken lived across town in a big house with perfect paint , large windows and a four-car garage . Johnny took a deep breath , thought of his mother bent over that mirror , and told himself that she was not that far gone . That was Ken 's deal , not hers . He forced his hands to unclench . The air was scrubbed , so he concentrated on that instead . He told himself that it was a new day , that good things could happen ; but mornings were bad for his mother . There was a moment when her eyes opened , a flash before she remembered that they 'd never found her only daughter . <p> Johnny 's sister . <p> His twin . <p> Alyssa was born three minutes after Johnny , and they 'd been as similar as nonidentical twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same laugh . She was a girl , yeah , but from twenty feet it was hard to tell them apart . They stood the same , walked the same . Most mornings , they woke at the same time , even in different rooms . Johnny 's mom said they 'd had their own language when they were small , but Johnny did n't remember that . He remembered that for most of his life , he 'd never been alone ; there was a special sense of belonging that only the two of them had ever understood . But Alyssa was gone , and everything with her . That was truth , unavoidable , and it had carved the insides out of his mother . So Johnny did what he could . He checked the locks at night and cleaned up the mess . Today it took twenty minutes ; then he put on coffee and thought about the rolled-up bill . <p> A hundred bucks . <p> Food and clothing . <p> He made a last check of the house . Bottles , gone . Signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the outside in , then checked the refrigerator . The milk carton rattled when he shook it . One egg in the carton . He opened his mother 's purse . She had nine dollars and change . Johnny left the money and closed the purse . He filled a glass with water and shook two aspirin out of a bottle . He walked down the hall and opened his mother 's door . <p> The first raw light of dawn pushed against the glass , an orange bulge beyond the black trees . His mother lay on her side , hair across her face . Magazines and books covered the bedside table . He made room for the glass and placed the aspirin on the scarred wood . For a second , he listened to her breathe , then looked at the stack of bills Ken had left by the bed . There were some twenties , a fifty . Maybe a few hundred dollars , wrinkled and smudged . <p> Peeled off a roll . <p> Discarded . <p> The car in the driveway was old , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The paint was clean and waxed , tire pressure checked every week , but that was all Johnny knew how to do . Blue smoke still belched from the pipe when he turned the key ; the passenger window did not go up all the way . He waited for the smoke to turn white , then put the car in gear and rolled to the bottom of the drive . He was nowhere close to having a license , and looked carefully before edging into the road . He kept the speed down and stayed on the back roads . The nearest store was only two miles away , but it was a big one , on a major road , and Johnny knew that people there might recognize him . He added three miles to the trip and went to a small grocery store that catered to the low end of things . The gas cost money and the food was more expensive , but he did n't really have a choice . Social Ser vices had already been to the house twice . <p> The car blended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American . A dark sedan rolled in behind him and stopped near the entrance . Sunlight mirrored the glass and a lone man sat faceless behind the wheel . He did not get out , and Johnny watched him as he walked to the store . <p> Johnny had a great fear of lone men in stopped cars . <p> The cart wobbled as he went up one aisle and down another . Just the basics , he decided : milk , juice , bacon , eggs , sandwich bread , fruit . He bought more aspirin for his mother . Tomato juice also seemed to help . <p> The cop stopped him at the end of aisle eight . He was tall and broad , with brown eyes that were too soft for the lines in his face , the hard angle of his jaw . He had no cart , stood with his hands in his pockets , and Johnny knew at a glance that he 'd followed him inside . He had that look , a kind of resigned patience . <p> And Johnny wanted to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How you doing ? " <p> His hair was longer than Johnny remembered , same brown as his eyes , shaggy and curling over the top of his collar with a bit of new silver threaded in at the sides . His face had thinned out , and some part of Johnny recognized that the year had been hard on him as well . Big as the cop was , he looked pressed down , haunted , but most of the world looked like that to Johnny , so he was n't sure . The cop 's voice was deep and concerned . It brought back so many bad memories that , for an instant , Johnny could neither move nor speak . The cop stepped closer and brought with him the same thoughtful expression that Johnny had seen so often , the same look of gentle worry . Some part of Johnny wanted to like the man , to trust him ; but he was still the one who let Alyssa fade away . He was still the one who lost her . <p> " I 'm good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanging in . " <p> The cop looked at his watch , then at Johnny 's grubby clothes and wild , black hair . It was forty minutes after six on a school day . " Any word from your father ? " he asked . <p> " No . " Johnny tried to hide the sudden shame . " No word . " <p> " I 'm sorry . " <p> The moment stretched , but the cop did not move . The brown eyes remained steady , and up close he looked just as big and calm as the first time he 'd come to Johnny 's house . But that was another memory , so Johnny stared at the man 's thick wrist , the clean , blunt nails . His voice cracked when he spoke . " My mother got a letter once . She said he was in Chicago , maybe going to California . " A pause , eyes moving from hand to floor . " He 'll come back . " <p> Johnny said it with conviction . The cop nodded once and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his daughter was grabbed . Too much pain . Too much guilt . His wife never let him forget that he was supposed to pick the girl up , never let him forget that she would not have been walking down the road at dusk if he 'd only done what he was supposed to do . <p> " It was n't his fault , " Johnny said . <p> " I never said it was . " <p> " He was working . He forgot the time . It was n't his fault . " <p> " We all make mistakes , son . Every last one of us . Your father is a good man . Do n't you ever doubt that . " <p> " I do n't . " Sudden resentment in Johnny 's voice . <p> " It 's okay . " <p> " I never would . " Johnny felt the color fall out of his face . He could not remember the last time he 'd spoken so much to a grown-up , but there was something about the cop . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed things , and there was a warmth to his face , a kindness that did n't seem fake or put on to trick a kid into trusting him . His eyes were always very still , and some part of Johnny hoped that he was a good enough cop to make things right . But it had been a year , and his sister was still gone . Johnny had to worry about the now , and in the now this cop was no friend . <p> There was Social Ser vices , which was just waiting for an excuse ; and then there were the things that Johnny did , the places he went when he cut school , the risks he took when he snuck out after midnight . If the cop knew what Johnny was doing , he would be forced to take action . Foster homes . The courts . <p> He would stop Johnny if he could . <p> " How 's your mom ? " the cop asked . His eyes were intent , hand still on the cart . <p> " Tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tires easily . " <p> The cop frowned for the first time . " Last time I found you here , you told me she had Lyme disease . " <p> He was right . " No . I said she had lupus . " <p> The cop 's face softened and he lifted his hand from the cart . " There are people who want to help . People who understand . " <p> Suddenly , Johnny was angry . No one understood , and no one offered to help . Not ever . " She 's just under the weather . Just run down . " <p> The cop looked away from the lie , but his face remained sad . Johnny watched his gaze fall to the aspirin bottle , the tomato juice . From the way his eyes lingered , it was obvious that he knew more than most about drunks and drug abusers . " You 're not the only one who 's hurting , Johnny . You 're not alone . " <p> " Alone enough . " <p> The cop sighed deeply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number on the back of it . He handed it to the boy . " If you ever need anything . " He looked determined . " Day or night . I mean it . " <p> Johnny glanced at the card , slipped it into the pocket of his jeans . " We 're fine , " he said , and pushed the cart around him . The cop dropped a hand on the boy 's shoulder . <p> " If he ever hits you again . . . " <p> Johnny tensed . <p> " Or your mother . . . " <p> Johnny shrugged the hand off . " We 're fine , " he repeated . " I 've got it covered . " <p> He pushed past the cop , terrified that he would stop him , that he would ask more questions or call one of the hard-faced women from Social Services . <p> The cart scraped against the counter at the register , and a large woman on a worn stool dipped her nose . She was new to the store , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen but looked years younger . He pulled the hundred from his pocket and put it faceup on the conveyor belt . " Can you hurry , please ? " <p> She popped gum and frowned . " Easy , sugar . Here we go . " <p> The cop lingered ten feet behind , and Johnny felt him there , eyes on his back as the fat lady rang up the groceries . Johnny forced himself to breathe , and after a minute , the cop walked past . " Keep that card , " he said . <p> " Okay . " Johnny could not bear to meet his eyes . <p> The cop turned , and his smile was not an easy one . " It 's always good to see you , Johnny . " <p> He left the store , visible through the broad plate glass . He walked past the station wagon , then turned and lingered for a moment . He looked through the window , then circled to check out the plate . Apparently satisfied , he approached his sedan and opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He waited . <p> Johnny tried to slow his heart , then reached for the change in the cashier 's damp and meaty hand . <p> The cop 's name was Clyde Lafayette Hunt . Detective . It said so on his card . Johnny had a collection of them tucked into his top drawer , hidden under his socks and a picture of his dad . He thought , at times , of the number on the card ; but then he thought of orphanages and foster homes . He thought of his disappeared sister and of the lead pipe he kept between his bed and the wall that leaked cold air . He thought that the cop probably meant what he said . He was probably a good guy . But Johnny could never look at him without remembering Alyssa , and that kind of thinking required concentration . He had to picture her alive and smiling , not in a dirt-floored cellar or in the back of some car . She was twelve the last time he 'd seen her . Twelve , with black hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened said she walked right up to the car , smiling even as the car door opened . <p> Smiling right up until somebody grabbed her . <p> Johnny heard that word all the time . Smiling . Like it was stuck in his head , a one-word recording he could n't shake . But he saw her face when he slept . He saw her looking back as the houses grew small . He saw the worry bloom , and he saw her scream . <p> Johnny realized that the cashier was staring , that his hand was still out , money in it , groceries bagged . She had one eyebrow up , jaw still working a wad of gum . <p> " You need something else , sugar ? " <p> Johnny shied . He wadded the bills and stuffed them into his pocket . " No , " he said . " I do n't need anything else . " <p> She looked past him , to the store manager who stood behind a low glass partition . He followed her gaze blued out while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and tried to ignore Detective Hunt . The bags made rasping sounds as they rubbed together . The milk sloshed , heavy on the right side . He put the bags in the backseat and hesitated . The cop was watching him from a car that angled out , less than twenty feet away . He gestured when Johnny straightened . <p> " I know how to drive , " Johnny said . <p> " I do n't doubt it . " The answer surprised Johnny . It 's like he was smiling . <p> " I know you 're tough , " he said , and the smile was gone . " I know you can handle most things , but the law is the law . " Johnny stood taller . " I ca n't let you drive . " <p> " I ca n't leave the car here , " Johnny said . " It 's the only one we have . " <p> " I 'll take you home . " <p> Johnny said nothing . He wondered if the house still smelled of bourbon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles away . <p> " I 'm trying to help you , Johnny . " The cop paused . " People do that , you know . " <p> " What people ? " The bitterness spilled out . <p> " It 's okay , " Detective Hunt said . " It 's fine . Just tell me your address . " <p> " You know where I live . I see you drive by sometimes , see you slow down when you do . So do n't pretend like you do n't know . " <p> Hunt heard the distrust . " I 'm not trying to trick you , son . I need the exact address so that I can have a patrol car meet me there . I 'll need a ride back to my car . " <p> Johnny studied the cop . " Why do you drive by so often ? " <p> " It 's like I said , Johnny . There are people who want to help . " <p> Johnny was n't sure that he believed him , but he recited the address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at the house . " Come on . " Hunt climbed out of the unmarked police car , crossed the lot to the station wagon . Johnny opened the passenger door and the cop slid behind the wheel . Johnny buckled up , then sat very still . For a long moment , neither moved . " I 'm sorry about your sister , " Hunt finally said . " I 'm sorry that I could n't bring her home . You know that , right ? " <p> Johnny stared straight ahead , his hands clenched white in his lap . The sun cleared the trees and pushed heat through the glass . <p> " Can you say something ? " Hunt asked . <p> Johnny turned , and his voice came , flat . " It was a year ago yesterday . " He knew that he sounded small . " Are you aware of that ? " <p> Hunt looked uneasy . " Yes , " he said . " I am aware of that . " <p> Johnny looked away . " Can you just drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue smoke rolled past Johnny 's window . " Okay , " the cop said . " Okay , Johnny . " <p> He put the car in gear . They rode in silence to the edge of town . No words , but Johnny smelled him . He smelled soap and gun oil , what may have been cigarette smoke on his clothes . He drove the way Johnny 's dad drove , quick and sure , gaze on the road , then on the rearview mirror . His lips compressed as they neared the house , and Johnny thought , one last time , of how he 'd said he 'd bring Alyssa home . A year ago . He 'd promised it . <p> A marked car was waiting in the driveway when they got there . Johnny climbed out and opened the back door for the grocery bags . " I can help with that , " Hunt said . <p> Johnny just looked at him . What did he want ? He lost her . <p> " I 've got it , " Johnny said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obvious that he had nothing to say . " Be good , " he finally said , and Johnny watched him slip into the police cruiser . He held the groceries and he did not move as the car backed into the road . He did not respond to Detective Hunt 's wave . He stood on the dusty drive and watched the cruiser rise on the distant hill , then fall away . He waited for his heart to slow , then took the bags inside . <p> The groceries looked small on the counter , but they felt like more : a victory . Johnny put them away , then started coffee and cracked a single egg into the pan . Blue flame popped in the iron ring , and he watched the egg turn white around the edges . He flipped it with care , then put it on a paper plate . The phone rang as he reached for a napkin . He recognized the number on caller ID and answered before it could ring twice . The kid on the other end had a scratchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drank like a grown-up . " You ditching today ? Let 's ditch . " <p> Johnny cut his eyes to the hall and kept his voice low . " Hello , Jack . " <p> " I 've been looking at some houses on the west side . It 's a bad area . Real bad . Lot of ex-convicts over there . Makes sense when you think about it . " <p> It was an old refrain . Jack knew what Johnny did when he cut school and snuck out after dark . He wanted to help , partly because he was a good kid , partly because he was bad . <p> " This is not some game , " Johnny said . <p> " You know what they say about a gift horse , man . This is free help . Do n't take it for granted . " <p> Johnny pushed out a breath . " Sorry , Jack . It 's one of those mornings . " <p> " Your mom ? " <p> Johnny 's throat closed , so he nodded . Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated him like he was not some kind of freak or pity case . They had some things in common , too . He was a small kid , like Johnny , and had his own share of problems . " I should probably go today . " <p> " Our history paper is due , " Jack said . " You done it ? " <p> " I turned that in last week . " <p> " Shit . Really ? I have n't even started mine yet . " <p> Jack was always late , and teachers always let him get away with it . Johnny 's mom once called Jack a rascal , and the word fit . He stole cigarettes from the teacher 's lounge and slicked his hair on Fridays . He drank more booze than any kid should and lied like a professional ; but he kept secrets when he said he would and watched your back if it needed watching . He was likable , sincere if he cared to be , and for a second , Johnny felt his spirits lift ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The wad of greasy bills by his mother 's bed . <p> " I got ta go , " Johnny said . <p> " What about cutting school ? " <p> " I got ta go . " Johnny hung up the phone . His friend 's feelings were hurt , but Johnny could n't help that . He picked up the plate , sat on the porch and ate his egg with three slices of bread and a glass of milk . He was still hungry when he finished , but lunch was only four and a half hours away . <p> He could wait . <p> Pouring coffee with milk , Johnny made his way down the dim hall to his mother 's room . The water was gone , so was the aspirin . Her hair was off her face , and a bar of sunlight cut across her eyes . Johnny put the mug on the table and opened a window . Cool air flowed in from the shady side of the house , and Johnny studied his mother . She looked paler , more tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee , but he wanted it there just in case . Just so she 'd know . <p> He started to turn , but she moaned in her sleep and made a violent twitch . She mumbled something and her legs thrashed twice , then she bolted up in bed , eyes wide and terrified . " Jesus Christ ! " she said . " Jesus Christ ! " <p> Johnny stood in front of her but she did not see him . What ever frightened her still had its grip . He leaned in , told her it was just a dream , and for that second her eyes seemed to know him . She raised a hand to his face . " Alyssa , " she said , and there was a question in her voice . <p> Johnny felt the storm coming . " It 's Johnny , " he told her . <p> " Johnny ? " Her eyes blinked , and then the day broke over her . The desperate gaze collapsed , the hand fell away , and she rolled back into the covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not open her eyes again . " Are you okay ? " he finally asked . <p> " Bad dream . " <p> " There 's coffee . You want any breakfast ? " <p> " Damn . " She flung off the covers and walked out of the room . She did not look back . Johnny heard the bathroom door slam . <p> He went outside and sat on the porch . Five minutes later , the school bus pulled onto the dirt verge . Johnny did not get up , he did not move . Eventually , the bus rolled on . <p> It took most of an hour for his mother to get dressed and find him on the porch . She sat beside him , draped thin arms across her knees . Her smile failed in every way , and Johnny remembered how it used to light up a room . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said , nudging him with a shoulder . Johnny looked up the road . She nudged him again . " Sorry . You know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to say , could not explain how it felt to know that it hurt her to look at him . He shrugged . " It 's okay . " <p> He felt her look for the right words . She failed in that , too . " You missed the bus , " she said . <p> " It does n't matter . " <p> " It does to the school . " <p> " I make perfect grades . Nobody cares if I 'm there or not . " <p> " Are you still seeing the school counselor ? " <p> He studied her with an unforgiving eye . " Not for six months now . " <p> " Oh . " <p> Johnny looked back up the road and felt his mother watching him . She used to know everything . They used to talk . When she spoke , her voice had an edge . " He 's not coming back . " <p> Johnny looked at his mother . " What ? " <p> " You keep looking up the road . You do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking over the hilltop . " Johnny opened his mouth , but she spoke over him . " It 's not going to happen . " <p> " You do n't know that . " <p> " I 'm just trying  --  " <p> " You do n't know that ! " <p> Johnny was on his feet with no recollection of standing . His hands were clenched for the second time that morning , and something hot pushed against the walls of his chest . His mother leaned back , arms still crossed over her knees . The light fell out of her eyes , and Johnny knew what was coming . She reached out a hand that fell short of actually touching him . " He left us , Johnny . It 's not your fault . " <p> She started to stand . Her lips softened and her face slipped into a look of pained understanding , the kind of expression grown-ups gave to kids who did n't quite get how the world worked . But Johnny understood . He knew the look and he hated it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " <p> " Johnny . . . " <p> " It was n't his fault that she got taken . You should have never told him that . " She stepped toward him . Johnny ignored the gesture . " He left because of you . " <p> She stopped midstride and ice snapped in her voice . The sympathetic twist fell from her lips . " It was his fault , " she said . " His fault and nobody else 's . Now she 's gone , and I 've got nothing . " <p> Johnny felt tremors start low in the backs of his legs . In seconds , he was shaking . It was an old argument , and it was tearing them apart . <p> She straightened and started to turn . " You always take his side , " she said , and then was gone , into the house , away from the world and her last child 's place in it . <p> Johnny stared at the faded door and then at his hands . He watched them shake , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched wind move dust on the roadside . He thought about his mother 's words , then he looked up the hill . It was not a pretty hill . There was an edge of ragged forest dotted with small houses and dirt drives , telephone lines that curved between the poles and looked especially black against the new sky . Nothing made the hill special , but he watched it for a long time . He watched it until his neck hurt , then he went inside to check on his mom . <p> Excerpted from THE LAST CHILD by JOHN HART <br> Copyright 2009 by John Hart <br> Published in MaY 2009 by St. Martin
