<p> The theater community is scared . If a Highlands Ranch lawmaker has his way , they have been told , Stanley Kowalski could be hauled off to jail for the rape of Blanche DuBois . Not the fictional character , but the actor portraying him in the Denver Center Theatre Company 's production of ' A Streetcar Named Desire . ' <p> Rep. Ted Harvey , R-Highlands Ranch , wants to make it a crime for any Colorado theater to expose kids ' to sexually explicit performances that are not appropriate for minors . ' <p> And the bill , which was passed by the House Judiciary Committee by an 8-3 vote and is expected to come up for a vote in the full House on Monday , is promising jail time for violators . <p> The theater provisions of the bill are part of a much larger proposed law aimed primarily at preventing pornography from being displayed at book stores , record stores , libraries , art museums and theaters . That would include everything from posters advertising plays to the productions themselves . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage kiss between two men or a nude portrait at the Denver Art Museum might bring down the long arm of the law : <p> ' You do n't have to worry , ' said Harvey , whose larger goal , he added , is to ban minors from strip joints that do not sell alcohol . <p> He also said this exact proposed law already is in effect in 43 states and the city of Aurora . <p> ' There are three criteria that a performance would have to meet in order to be considered harmful , ' he said . ' Those with a predominant tendency to arouse the prurient interest of minors ; those that an average adult would find offensive ; and those that the average adult would deem lacking in any scientific , political or literary value whatsoever . ' <p> The most troubling aspect of that definition is in the vague notion of what the ' average adult ' might believe to be offensive . <p> That burden will fall on district attorneys , Harvey said , which should keep individuals with religious or political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual theatrical productions that may run counter to their own points of view . <p> Still , proponents of the constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression are concerned by the subjective application of the word ' prurient , ' which the dictionary defines as ' arousing an unwholesome interest or desire . ' <p> What on local stages might constitute prurience in the eyes of an offended theatergoer ? The comically promiscuous character who 's always talking about sex in Buntport 's sit-com ' Magnets on the Fridge ? Or perhaps Boulder 's Dinner Theater 's ' Chicago , ' a Tony-winning musical that is red-hot from start to finish ? <p> Ridiculous , Harvey said , because even if one outraged citizen were to complain , ' Every D.A . is well-versed in the law , and they would never bring charges in those kinds of cases . ' <p> He was less sure about whether a D.A . might have stepped in last year and slapped an age limit on the Denver Civic Theatre 's record-setting production of ' Puppetry of the Penis , ' which , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 - even without government intervention . <p> More troubling to consider is how a D.A . might react to a complaint about Theatre Group 's ' The Crumple Zone , ' which includes the start of a gay sexual encounter . An ' average adult ' might consider two men kissing offensive . When does the offense of the majority rise to censorable action by a D.A. ? <p> ' It wo n't , ' Harvey said , ' because it would have to meet all three of the criteria , and I ca n't see anyone arguing that a play with two men kissing has no artistic , political or literary value . It just wo n't happen . ' <p> But Colorado Theatre Guild president Steve Wilson is n't so sure that someone wo n't try to use the bill to push an agenda . <p> ' What about a play like ' Angels in America ? ' It has a gay sex scene in it , and it won two Tonys and the Pulitzer Prize , ' Wilson said . ' I can only imagine what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to censor material that has been determined by others to be among the most valuable material of our time . ' <p> Perhaps most disturbing is to consider what might happen if a company were to be found in violation . Who goes to jail ? The actor ? The artistic director ? The ticket-taker who failed to ID a kid at the door ? <p> Harvey said he was confident any court would find his bill to be constitutionally sound , and LIDA Project artistic director Brian Freeland , who is currently presenting the explicitly titled play , ' F  --  in ' A , ' said Harvey would be quickly obliged . <p> ' Someone is going to have to break the law and get arrested for it , and I will be happy to be first in line , ' said Freeland , who added that Harvey might better focus his outrage at sexually explicit commercials and billboards featuring the Coors Light twins . <p> ' What message do you think that campaign is sending minors ? ' asked Freeland . <p> An irony of the bill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet its legislators nevertheless feel they maintain the right to dictate what kind of art can be presented here . <p> ' Primus ' prize revived <p> The Denver Center 's prestigious Francesca Primus Prize for women 's playwrights , which went on hiatus after budget cuts in 2002 , resumes in June under the auspices of the American Theatre Critics Association . And the prize will increase from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 . <p> ' We hope to make it one of the most distinguished and well-known awards in American theatre , ' said ATCA chair Michael Barnes . <p> Briefly a <p> Same-day discounted tickets to 20 cultural groups , including the Denver Center Theatre Company , Denver Center Attractions , Colorado Symphony Orchestra and Cleo Parker Robinson Dance are now available in a new booth at the Cherry Creek Shopping Center .
