The Beatles ' manager Brian Epstein was gay , wealthy and chronically insecure . That may be why , while recording Magical Mystery Tour in 1967 , John Lennon deliberately mangled a couple of choruses . According to Bob Spitz 's colossal quadruple biography The Beatles ( Little , Brown ; 983 pages ) , instead of singing , " Baby , you 're a rich man too , " Lennon sang , " Baby , you 're a rich fag Jew . " <P> That kind of gratuitous cruelty is n't all that uncommon in The Beatles . The Fab Four hated the silly , lovable mop-top image they created , and on that score alone they would probably love Spitz 's book . He marshals a staggering mass of research in support of the conclusion , broadly speaking , that Lennon was a drug-addled , attention-hungry rageoholic who picked fights and cheated on his wife ; Paul McCartney was a smarmy , manipulative charmer ; and George Harrison was dour and sour . Before you lose faith entirely , it turns out Ringo really was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatles are irresistible ; they have the hypnotic effect of a film clip run backward , the separate pieces of a single whole coming together from the hard-luck streets of Liverpool . All four Beatles were hard cases of various kinds , but Ringo takes the prize . Poor , sickly and essentially fatherless , he took up drumming as therapy while he was hospitalized for tuberculosis , pounding on his bedside cabinet using two cotton bobbins for drumsticks . <P> It 's a miracle that these four geniuses found one another , and it 's a miracle they did n't then kill each other . But The Beatles is n't all dirt . Spitz brings readers inside the studio , where the Beatles , none of whom could read music , generated a staggering catalog of innovations , including the first use of feedback . He also pries open the songwriting dyad of McCartney and Lennon , who could n't seem to stop writing perfect pop songs even when they could n't stand each other . Anything was raw material : a cornflakes jingle ( Good Morning , Good Morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Am the Walrus ) , the stoned ramblings of Peter Fonda ( She Said She Said ) . <P> Spitz is n't much for big theories , but that 's O.K. The details are what 's new and interesting anyway . Similarly , the beginning of the book is more interesting than its end , which is pretty much the Yokotastrophe you 'd expect . When John was 5 , his mom and dad separated . His father sat him down and made him choose which parent he would live with . At first he chose his father , but after his mother left , the desperate little boy went running up the street after her . That poignant image hints at the ineffable , aching heart of Lennon 's creativity , and his cruelty too . You get the feeling John never really stopped running .
