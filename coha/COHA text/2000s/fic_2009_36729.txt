You Ca n't Judge a Book by Its Cover <p> London , England May 1870 <p> " Hello ! " a deep masculine voice called . " Is anybody here ? " <p> The words echoed through Hamilton 's Book Shoppe , a small but quaint building on a side lane off Bond Street in Mayfair , London 's most fashionable district . Lucien Sinclair , the Earl of Waverly , looked around the dark and cluttered interior searching for signs of the proprietor . <p> Growing impatient , Lucien ventured another call , this time a little louder . Honestly , one would think Mr. Hamilton had no desire to do any business if he were not present to greet potential customers when they arrived . <p> " Just a moment , please ! " a dulcet voice exclaimed from the back of the shop . " I shall be right with you ! " <p> Finally . A response of some sort . Well , that explained the delay , Lucien thought to himself . Apparently a woman was left to tend the shop . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case his little venture would be for naught . He highly doubted the lady in the back room would be able to assist him . <p> He had met the owner of the shop over a year ago and had found him to be most agreeable . A kind and genial man who was very intent on helping Lucien choose the exact type of literature that would interest him , Mr. Hamilton would n't rest until Lucien was totally satisfied with his selection of authors . Lucien had only purchased the books out of boredom one day , hoping to ease the restlessness that plagued him from time to time , but once he returned home , he had lost interest in the little stack of books chosen by the eager bookseller , and he became immersed in his demanding social life once again . <p> However , a few weeks ago his father 's sudden illness required him to spend more time at home to look after the weakened man and keep him company . Lucien began to read to his bedridden father , finally putting the forgotten books to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually enjoyed them . He realized how much he missed reading for pleasure , since he had not done much of it since his days at Oxford . Now he wanted to speak with Mr. Hamilton , not only to thank him , but also to ask his suggestion for new books he and his father might appreciate . <p> Glancing around , he noticed the little bookshop was not quite how he remembered it , but then again it had been over a year since he had visited there last . If he was not mistaken , the bookshop had been remarkably like any other that he had seen in his life ; dark , disordered , and fairly dusty . Now it appeared to be undergoing some sort of transformation . Wooden crates , some of which were stacked and some open , and an assortment of hundreds of leather-bound books lay scattered in haphazard heaps on the floor , large buckets of paint and various sized brushes rested on a work table , and long sheets of canvas covered half the room . <p> " I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle voice intoned once again and Lucien turned to see a woman walking toward him . " Welcome to Hamilton 's . How may I help you , sir ? " <p> Never one to miss a pretty face , Lucien instinctively noted the one belonging to the lady in front of him . From her small stature , he judged her to be very young , perhaps seventeen , seeing as there was a youthful air about her . Still , she approached him in a businesslike manner . She must be minding her papa 's store for the first time . He frowned . <p> " I was hoping to speak to Mr. Hamilton , " he responded in his most imperious tone . <p> As she stepped closer he revised his initial impression of her , for she was more than passably pretty . In spite of the dirt smudges on her fair skin , the dust motes sprinkled in her rich brunette hair , and the drab , shapeless gray smock that covered the navy dress she wore , her face was stunningly beautiful in its perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded him with what seemed like skepticism . Even disdain . Her demeanor shocked him . Such an odd thing ! Could n't she tell he was a nobleman ? What would prompt the beautiful girl to look at him in such a condescending way ? As if she knew more than he did ? As if she had dealt with his kind before ? <p> " I am Miss Hamilton , his daughter . I can assist you . " <p> The challenging , practically defiant , tilt to her head almost knocked him over . Once again he realized he was in error . She was older than he first thought , for she handled herself far too confidently . She must be closer to twenty . Again he frowned . He refused to deal with a haughty shopkeeper 's daughter . <p> " I 'm sure you are quite a charming young lady , but I was hoping your father could assist me . Perhaps I shall return at another time when he is available to offer his expertise . Would you please tell me when I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months ago . " She stated this matter-of-factly , revealing no emotion , her face calm and serene . <p> Feeling like a callous idiot , he said earnestly , " I am very sorry to hear that , Miss Hamilton . I only knew him briefly , but your father seemed to be a good man . Please accept my sincerest condolences on your loss . " <p> She nodded her head in acknowledgment of his sympathy . " Thank you . " <p> After an awkward pause , he asked out of polite curiosity , " Who is responsible for running the bookshop now ? " <p> " I am . " <p> That truly took him aback . A mere woman , this little slip of a girl , maintaining a business ? It was preposterous . Ridiculous . Unheard of . She ought to be safely married with a home to manage , not working in a store . <p> " How old are you ? " Lucien asked without thinking . <p> " Old enough . How old are you ? " she countered quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely you have help ? You could not handle such an enterprise on your own . A brother or an uncle or a male cousin must be overseeing you , " he said . <p> Again that defiant look crossed the elegant features of her face , making her appear more assertive than he had first anticipated . <p> " You are aware that a woman is running our country , are you not ? " <p> " Well , that 's different , " he sputtered in his defense . " Queen Victoria was born and raised to rule and has advisors and counselors to guide her . " <p> " I too was raised to oversee this shop . I have no male relatives to help me , yet I manage quite well without the assistance of men , thank you , " she responded with unmasked condescension . <p> Lucien did not approve of women having to work , and for some reason her particular situation upset him . This girl was far too beautiful to be in charge of a business with no male to guide her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , it was simply wrong . A woman should be taken care of , not left to fend for herself . <p> " You seem rather too delicate and too young to shoulder such weighty responsibilities , Miss Hamilton . " <p> She sighed heavily , her manner revealing she had explained this many times before . " I 've been assisting my father since I was a child . I assure you , I am quite capable of running the bookshop on my own , Mister ... ? " <p> He gazed at her skeptically , but answered her unspoken question . " I apologize for not introducing myself sooner . I am Lucien Sinclair , the Earl of Waverly . It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance , Miss Hamilton . " <p> " How can I assist you today , Lord Waverly ? " she asked with a decidedly lofty tone . <p> He could not help but notice the unmistakable emphasis she placed on the " I " when she spoke . Irked by her obvious confidence , he glared back at her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer . And as a gentleman . Something about her made him want to rattle that self-assurance of hers a little . <p> " I came to speak to your father about selecting some books , but since you are here , let 's see if you can help me . I need to purchase a gift . A present for " - he paused with deliberateness , raised one eyebrow , and grinned daringly at her- " a lady . " <p> She gave him a withering look and he wondered if she treated all her customers with such disdain or just him in particular . <p> " Was there a specific type of book you had in mind for this lady ? " she questioned with an air of superiority . <p> Noting her skeptical inflection of the word lady , Lucien felt slightly vindicated . " Are you knowledgeable about poetry ? " he asked , for Lord knew he was not . <p> " Knowledgeable enough . " <p> Something about the shape of her mouth intrigued him and he could not stop staring at her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of summer-ripe berries . He found himself wondering what they would taste like and if they would be as sweet as they looked . How was a girl this beautiful not married yet ? She must be an awful harridan . It was the only explanation that made sense . <p> " What about love poems ? " he continued . " Do you know anything about love poems ? " <p> " I think I know what you have in mind , " she stated dryly . <p> He was trying to bait her and she refused to be reeled in . Miss Hamilton merely turned and made her way carefully to a stack of books in the corner . She picked up a small , red leather-bound book and handed it to him . <p> " This should do . " <p> He glanced at the gold-lettered title , A Collection of Romantic Love Poems , and laughed . " Now , how did you know this was exactly what I had in mind ? " <p> " Experience , " she retorted without hesitation . <p> He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Hamilton , I would n't have expected it of you . " <p> Ignoring his innuendo , she gazed at him wearily . <p> " Have you read this ? " he asked out of perverse curiosity . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Which poem do you recommend as being the most romantic ? " <p> " Page seventy-four . " She folded her arms across her chest and sighed . " Now , is there anything else I can do for you today , Lord Waverly ? " <p> " Most definitely , Miss Hamilton , but I do n't believe you would agree to it , " he surprised even himself by saying . Something about the woman set him on edge . He wanted to read the poem on page seventy-four , but found himself staring at her instead . <p> On impulse he stepped toward her and she instinctively backed away from him . Now that was a reaction he expected . He moved forward and she predictably moved back until she was pressed against a table laden with stacks of books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the table behind her . He closed in on her , standing mere inches from her petite body . <p> At this proximity he was able to breathe her scent . It was something floral and delicate and reminded him of a summer meadow . She smelled heavenly , even though she had obviously been immersed in cleaning before he arrived . Being that she barely reached the middle of his chest , she was required to tilt her head back to see his face . Wide eyes , the color of the sky on a cloudless June morning , stared up at him with mixed emotions . Surprise . Expectation . And again that determined look of defiance . But not fear . <p> Not this girl . <p> He had the oddest sensation that she could see right through him , leaving him feeling off balance . A feeling he was decidedly unaccustomed to having . Yet the beauty of her face mesmerized him . Such a dainty little nose ! She had perfect skin , as smooth as fine china , with not a freckle or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipe the dirt smudges from her soft cheek overwhelmed him , he held himself in check , his hands at his sides , his fingers clenched tightly around the book of poems . <p> Instead , their intense stare continued for what seemed an endlessly long time as her intelligent eyes held his in an unwavering gaze . Something intangible sparked between them . An unexplained intimacy , a sense of knowing , an ethereal bond , a chemistry of sorts . Lucien had heard or read dozens descriptions of such sensations before but never had he felt something this intense himself . It was as if they were suddenly the only two people in the world , and a wild desire to kiss her , to taste for himself those luscious lips , charged through every vein in his body . Lucien realized he was holding his breath , and if he were not mistaken , Miss Hamilton held hers also . That intrigued him and made him want to kiss her even more , to set her world off-kilter , too . <p> What would she do if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage ? Would she slap him in indignation , as she rightfully should ? Or would this woman let him kiss her pretty , tempting mouth , pressing his lips ever so softly against hers , just to start ? He had earned himself quite a reputation over the years , and many women had gossiped about his romantic talents . <p> Then again , he had never advanced on an innocent woman he had just met all of five minutes earlier . <p> What had come over him ? <p> He wanted to kiss her , and he did not like how desperately he wanted to kiss her . He did n't even like the type of woman she was : independent , defiant , and self-assured . All attributes that he found objectionable in women . Still , unable to stop himself from touching her , he slowly reached out his hand to her . He saw her tremble , felt her expectation , but she did not resist . She did not so much as flinch from him , which made him grin . Her blue eyes rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of her head . <p> Very carefully , and ever so gently , he removed a fluffy dust mote from her silky , coffee-colored hair . Holding the bit of fuzz on the tip of his index finger , he blew on it with a puff of his breath . They both watched in mute fascination as it floated lazily to the ground at their feet . <p> Suddenly Miss Hamilton pushed by him , spinning back around to face him , her long navy skirt twirling around her legs . In an instant she became all business once again , the intensely intimate yet unexplored moment between them lost , leaving him battling a sense of sharp disappointment at the evaporation of all that moment had promised . <p> " Since this book of poetry is all you require today , shall I wrap it for you , Lord Waverly ? " The frostiness of her tone of voice matched the cold look on her beautiful face . All traces of the warm and inviting woman who had wanted him to kiss her had vanished . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them . That a highly charged connection had not sparked so wildly in their eyes . That he , a complete stranger , had not almost kissed her there in broad daylight in the middle of her father 's chaotic little bookshop . <p> She was not easily ruffled , that was for certain . Whereas he was more unsettled than he cared to admit to himself . <p> " That would be lovely , Miss Hamilton . " He handed the book of poetry back to her with a gallant sweep of his arm and followed her to the counter . He leaned leisurely on the polished wood , resting his chin on his hand . " Does Miss Hamilton have a first name ? " <p> She glared at him . " Of course I do . " <p> He grinned at her , his most charming , most winning smile . The one that got him his way with every female he had ever encountered . It truly came in most handy at times . <p> " May I have the honor of knowing your name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He echoed in disbelief , raising an eyebrow , a bit stunned by her refusal . <p> " No . " She did not meet his eyes . <p> " Then I shall have to guess your name , " he persisted . " Let 's see ... Katherine ? Mary ? Victoria ? Margaret ? " <p> She shook her head at each suggestion as she methodically wrapped the little red leather book in brown paper . Her elegant fingers moved with efficient skill as she folded the paper with sharp , straight creases . <p> " Nothing traditional , then ? Because your father owned a bookshop , perhaps your name has a more literary inclination . How about Lydia ? Tess ? No , not quite . Alice ? Goldilocks ? " <p> He noticed the glimmer of a smile playing at the corners of her sensuous lips and felt his stomach tighten in response to her . He continued his guessing game . " Ophelia ? Juliette ? " <p> " Juliette is my sister 's name , " she admitted with slight reluctance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father had a passion for Shakespeare . " <p> " No . Juliette is just a coincidence . " <p> " So it 's simply an affinity for French names , is that it ? " <p> She nodded her head . <p> " This should be interesting now . I did n't suspect you of having an exotic French name . Is it DesirTe ? Jacqueline ? Angelique ? " <p> She rolled her blue eyes heavenward in exasperation . " It 's Colette . " <p> " Colette ? How very intriguing . " <p> In an odd way the French/English name suited her perfectly . Colette Hamilton . She was a woman of contrasts . Beauty and business . Youth and maturity . Sensuality and innocence . He could not stop thinking about her . <p> She continued to ignore him as she artfully tied a pretty green ribbon around the brown paper package . The bright bow added a distinctive flourish to the wrapping . <p> " Nice touch , " he commented on her handiwork . <p> " Thank you . " She held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p>
