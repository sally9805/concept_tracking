BRAIN TEASER What sordid scandal that took place in Seattle became part of a test question for high school students across Washington ? The question on a new standardized test did not concern state history but rather logic . Students were challenged to map the correct route between fictitious towns . Clever 10th-graders who marked the right answer ( C ) traveled from Mayri , went through Clay and Lee and ended up in Turno . Eureka ! Mary K. Letourneau , the elementary school teacher who seduced her 13-year-old former student and later had two children by him , one while she was serving time for her misdeeds . Washington 's state superintendent of public education called the prank sophomoric and has begun an investigation . Unfortunately for those who answered correctly , the question will no longer be counted in the final score .
