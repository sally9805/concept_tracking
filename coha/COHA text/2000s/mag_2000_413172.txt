OREGON HAZELNUTS PETER MCDONALD High atop a tractor , farmer McDonald emerges from the dense green canopy of his 75-acre hazelnut orchard along the Willamette River near Wilsonville , south of Portland . He hauls a wood tote piled with 1,300 pounds of just-gathered nuts . " During the harvest in October , we work 12- to 14hour days-longer if rain is expected , " McDonald says . He and his son , James , mechanically sweep the ripe nuts that have fallen to the orchard floor into windrows . Then a giant machine sucks up the nuts and shoots them into the totes . At the processing plant , they 're washed and dried , then sent to be shelled if their intended market requires it . First planted in 1858 , hazelnuts from the Willamette Valley account for 99 percent of the U.S. commercial crop . In a good year , McDonald and his fellow farmers together bring in as many as 38,000 tons . McDonald finds the varying beauty of the orchard through the year irresistible-especially in January , when the trees bloom and pollinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " it looks like someone put up a zillion Christmas tree ornaments , " he says . Besides , " it 's fun being the brunt of all the nut jokes in the world . " No amount of kidding , though , can change his opinion : " When they 're roasted , hazelnuts are the best nuts by far !

" We can get 1,500 to 2,000 flats per acre . " That translates into a lot of persimmons , given his 30-acre orchard . Sadoian and his family primarily grow the Hachiya persimmon , one of the two chief market varieties . Hachiyas thrive in hot inland parts of the West , such as here in California 's Central Valley . They also do well in milder coastal zones . Marked by their pointed tips , hachiyas are picked after they 've turned bright orange but while they 're still firm . Before being eaten they must be allowed to ripen further to lose their puckery astringency and become as soft and sweet as jelly . Sadoian also tends a handful of Fuyu persimmon trees , the other main market variety . Flat-bottomed Fuyus can be eaten while they 're as crisp as apples or after they 've softened a bit . Both varieties ripen slowly at room temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl on your kitchen table-a bright reflection of the season .
