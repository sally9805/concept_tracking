Chapter One My working relationship with Lucifer began on a rainy Monday . I 'd just settled down to a long afternoon of watching the holovid soaps and doing a little divination , spreading the cards and runes out on the hank of blue silk I 'd laid out , when there was a bashing on my door that shook the walls . I turned over a card , my lacquered fingernails scraping . The amber ring on my left middle finger sparked . The Devil card pulsed , landing atop a pile of flat runestones . I had n't touched it . The card I turned over was blank . " Interesting , " I said , gooseflesh rippling up my back . Then I hauled myself up off the red threadbare carpet and padded barefoot out into the hallway . My rings flashed , a drift of green sparks snapping and popping down my fingers . I shook them off , frowning . The lines of Power wedded to my front door twirled uneasily . Something nasty was on my front step . I hitched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the sword hanging on the wall . I lifted it down , chucked the blade free with my thumb against the guard . The peephole in the middle of the door was black , no light spilling through . I did n't bother looking . Instead , I touched the door , spreading the fingers of my right hand against smooth iron . My rings rang and vacillated , reading theflow of whatever was behind the door . Oh , gods above and below , I thought . Whatever it is , it 's big . Bracing myself for murder or a new job , I unlocked the door and stepped back , my sword half-drawn . The blue glow from Power-drenched steel lit up my front hall , glimmering against the white paint and the full-length mirror hung next to my coatrack . I waited . The door creaked slowly open . Let 's have some mood music for effect , I thought sardonically , and prepared to sell myself dear if it was murder . I can draw my sword in a little under a second and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I blinked . Standing on my front step was a tall , spare , golden-skinned man dressed in black jeans and a long , black , Chinese-collared coat . The bright silver gun he held level to my chest was only slightly less disconcerting than the fact that his aura was cloaked in twisting black-diamond flames . He had dark hair cut short and laser-green eyes , a forgettable face and dreamy wide shoulders . Great . A demon on my doorstep , I thought , and did n't move . I barely even breathed . " Danny Valentine ? " he asked . Well , demanded , actually . " Who wants to know ? " I shot back , automatically . The silvery gun did n't look like a plasgun , it looked like an old-fashioned 9mm . " I wish to speak with Danny Valentine , " the demon enunciated clearly , " or I will kill you . " " Come on in , " I said . " And put that thing away . Did n't your mother ever teach you it was bad manners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what a Necromance has guarding his door ? " the demon replied . " Where is Danny Valentine ? " I heaved a mental sigh . " Come on in off my front porch , " I said . " I 'm Danny Valentine , and you 're being really rude . If you 're going to try to kill me , get it over with . If you want to hire me , this is so the wrong way to go about it . " I do n't think I 've ever seen a demon look nonplussed before . He holstered his gun and stepped into my front hall , peeling through the layers of my warding , which parted obediently to let him through . When he stood in front of me , kicking the door shut with one booted foot , I had him calculated down to the last erg of Power . This is not going to be fun , I thought . What is a Lord of Hell doing on my doorstep ? Well , no time like the present to ask . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " I have come to offer you a contract , " he said . " Or more precisely , to invite you to audience with the Prince , where he will present you with a contract . Fulfill this contract successfully , and you will be allowed to live with riches beyond your wildest dreams . " It did n't sound like a rote speech . I nodded . " And if I said I was n't interested ? " I asked . " You know , I 'm a busy girl . Raising the dead for a living is a high-demand skill nowadays . " The demon regarded me for maybe twenty seconds before he grinned , and a cold sweat broke out all over my body . My nape prickled and my fingers twitched . The three wide scars on my back twitched uneasily . " Okay , " I said . " Let me get my things , and I 'll be happy to attend His Gracious Princeship , yadda-yadda , bing-bong . Capice ? " He looked only slightly less amused , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . You have twenty minutes . " If I 'd known what I was getting into , I would have asked for a few days . Like maybe the rest of my life . ( Continues ... )
