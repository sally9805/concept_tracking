Forest Park was pretty in the summer . Portland 's ash sky was barely visible behind a canopy of aspens , hemlock , cedars , and maples that filtered the light to a shimmering pale green . A light breeze tickled the leaves . Morning glories and ivy crept up the mossy tree trunks and strangled the blackberry bushes and ferns , a mass of crawling vines that piled up waist-high on either side of the packed dirt path . The creek hummed and churned , birds chirped . It was all very lovely , very Walden , except for the corpse . <p> The woman had been dead awhile . Her skull was exposed ; her scalp had been pulled back , a tangle of red hair separated from the hairline by several inches . Animals had eaten her face , exposing her eyes and brain to the forces of putrefaction . Her nose was gone , revealing the triangular bony notch beneath it ; her eye sockets were concave bowls of greasy , soaplike fat . The flesh of her neck and ears was blistered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull face , mouth open like a Halloween skeleton . <p> " Are you there ? " <p> Archie turned his attention back to the cell phone he held against his ear . " Yeah . " <p> " Want me to wait on dinner ? " <p> He glanced down at the dead woman , his mind already working the case . Could be an OD . Could be murder . Could be she fell from the wheel well of a 747 . Archie had seen that last one on an episode of Law &amp; Order . " I 'm thinking no , " he said into the phone . <p> He could hear the familiar concern in Debbie 's voice . He 'd been doing well . He 'd cut back on the pain pills , gained a little weight . But he and Debbie both knew it was all too tenuous . Mostly , he pretended . He pretended to live , to breathe , to work ; he pretended he was going to be okay . It seemed to help the people he loved . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for them . " Be sure you eat something , " she said with a sigh . <p> " I 'll grab something with Henry . " Archie flipped the phone shut and dropped it into his coat pocket . His fingers touched the brass pillbox that was also in his pocket , and lingered there for a moment . It had been more than two and a half years since his ordeal . He 'd only been off medical leave a few months . Long enough to catch his second serial killer . He was thinking of getting some business cards made up : SERIAL KILLER APPREHENSION SPECIALIST . Maybe something embossed . His head hurt and he reflexively moved to open the lid of the pillbox , then let his fingers drop and lifted his hand from his pocket and ran it through his hair . No . Not now . <p> He squatted next to Lorenzo Robbins , who sat on his heels inches from the body , his dreadlocks hidden under the hood of his white Tyvek suit . The smooth stones of the creek bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Robbins asked . <p> Archie pulled a small notebook and a pen out of his other pocket . A flashbulb went off as a crime photographer took a picture behind them . " My ex-wife . " <p> " You guys still close ? " <p> Archie drew an outline of the woman in his notebook . Marked where the surrounding trees were , the creek below . " We live together . " <p> " Oh . " <p> The flashbulb went off again . " It 's a long story , " Archie said , rubbing his eyes with one hand . <p> Robbins used a pair of forceps to lift the woman 's loose scalp , so he could peer under it . When he did , dozens of black ants scurried out over her skull and into the decomposing tissue inside her nasal aperture . " Dogs have been here . " <p> " Wild ? " Archie asked , twisting around to look up at the thick surrounding forest . Forest Park was five thousand acres , the largest urban wilderness park in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were crowded . The area where the body had been found was in the lower part of the park , which was frequented by a steady stream of joggers , hikers , and mountain bikers . Several houses were even visible up the hillside . <p> " Domestic probably , " Robbins said . He turned and jabbed a latex-gloved thumb up the hillside . " Way the body 's down here behind the scrub , ca n't see it from the path . People come running through with their dogs off leash . Sparky scrambles down here , tears a hunk of cheek off the corpse . " He looked down at the corpse and shrugged . " They think he 's found a dead bird or whatever . Owner lets him sniff around a little . Then they run on . " <p> " You 're saying she was eaten by pugs ? " <p> " Over time . A few weeks . " <p> Archie shook his head . " Nice . " <p> Robbins raised an eyebrow as he glanced back up at the path . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a sewer leak , " Archie said . " One of the houses at the top of the hill . " <p> The eyebrow shot up another few millimeters . " For two weeks ? " Archie drew the hiking path across the page of his notebook . It was maybe forty feet above , at its closest point . Then it curved and headed farther up the hillside , deeper into the woods . " People rationalize . " <p> " You thinking she was a prostitute ? " <p> " Based on the shoes ? " She was still wearing one  --  an amber Lucite pump . The other they had found nestled in moss underneath a fern a few yards away . " Maybe . Maybe she was a stylish thirteen year-old . Hard to tell . " Archie looked at the grinning mouth , the teeth straight and white against all the surrounding blood and gristle . " She 's got nice teeth . " <p> " Yeah , " Robbins agreed softly . " She 's got nice teeth . " <p> Archie watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentatively , down the hillside . He was wearing black jeans , a black T-shirt , and a black leather jacket , despite the heat . Henry kept his eyes down , lips pursed in concentration , arms outstretched for balance . With his arms extended and his shaved head , he looked like a circus strongman . He walked sideways , trying to step in Archie 's footprints , but his feet were bigger than Archie 's and each step sent a spit of dirt and small rocks rattling down the embankment . Above them , on the hillside , Archie could see that everyone had stopped to watch , their faces anxious . A homeless man looking for a place to set up camp had found the body and called the police from a convenience store a few blocks outside the park . He had met the first officer to respond and taken him to the site , where the officer had promptly lost his footing in the loose dirt and slid down the hillside into the creek , polluting the crime scene and nearly breaking his leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know if they had a homicide . <p> Henry reached the bottom , winked at Archie , and then turned and waved merrily up above . The cops at the top of the hill all turned back to their work taping the crime scene off , and keeping the growing group of sportily dressed hikers and joggers at bay . <p> Henry smoothed his salt-and-pepper mustache thoughtfully with a thumb and forefinger and rocked forward to examine the body , allowing himself a reflexive grimace . Then business . " What killed her ? " he asked . <p> Robbins placed a bag over one of her bloated , mottled hands and secured it with a twist-tie . He did it gingerly , as if she had nodded off and he did n't want to wake her . The fingers curled , blistered and swollen , and the nail beds were black , but the hand was still recognizable , though probably not printable . The other , which lay half buried in the earth and moss , was crawling with beetles . " Search me , " Robbins said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Hard to say until we know what killed her , " Robbins answered . He gazed up at Henry . " Do you wax your head or is it naturally that shiny ? " <p> Archie smiled . Henry had called Robbins out at the police softball game that spring . It had been like this ever since . <p> " I was just asking , " Henry said to Robbins . <p> " Ask me after the autopsy , " Robbins muttered . He produced another bag and gave it a snap in the air , and then gently lifted her other hand so he could slide it into the bag . The beetles scattered , and Henry took a small step back . <p> Archie wrote something in his notebook . It had been thirteen years since they had stood over another dead girl in that park . That had set them on the trail of the Beauty Killer . They did n't know back then it would become a career . Or that Archie would become one of her victims . <p> A voice from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry looked up at the path , where Claire Masland was waving for them to come back up the hill . He put his hands on his hips . " You 've got to be kidding me , " he said to Archie . <p> Claire motioned again . This time she put her whole arm into it . <p> " I 'll go first , " Archie said . He glanced back at Henry and added , " So when you fall you wo n't take us both down . " <p> " Ha , ha , " said Henry . <p> " What do you have ? " Archie asked Claire when they reached the path . Claire was small and angular with a very short haircut . She was wearing a striped T-shirt and jeans . Her gold shield was clipped to her waistband , along with a phone , a gun in a leather holster , and a pair of red plastic sunglasses jauntily hooked through a belt loop . She tilted her head at a young uniformed cop who was covered in dirt . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first responder . " <p> Bennett looked like a kid , tall with a baby face and a slight double chin that pressed fretfully against a skinny neck . He hunched his shoulders miserably . " I 'm so sorry , " he said . <p> " Show them , " Claire told Bennett . He sighed glumly and turned around . He had taken a header down the ravine and his uniform was stained with muck , and tiny bits of vegetation still clung to his shirt . <p> Both Henry and Archie leaned forward to get a better look . Clinging to Bennett 's shoulder blade , among the fern seeds , the moss particulate , and the dirt , was , unmistakably , a clue . <p> Henry looked at Archie . " That would be a human hair , " he said . <p> " When you , uh , fell , " Archie asked Bennett . " Did you actually make contact with the body ? " <p> Bennett 's spine stiffened . " Jesus no , sir . I swear . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Henry . <p> Archie pulled a slim black flashlight out of his pocket and shone it along the length of the red hair . He held it for Henry to look . There was a tiny clump of tissue at the base of the hair . " It 's got a scalp fragment on it , " Archie said . <p> Bennett whipped his head around , eyes wide . " Get it off me , " he pleaded . " Get it off me , okay ? " <p> " Easy , son , " Henry said . <p> Claire , who was a good foot shorter than Bennett , reached up and plucked the hair off and dropped it in an evidence bag . <p> Archie called a crime scene tech over . " Bag all his clothes . Socks , everything . " <p> " But what will I wear ? " Bennett asked as the crime scene tech led him off . <p> Claire turned to Archie and Henry . The path they were on was about three feet wide , carved worryingly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taped off to let the fifty-year-old women by , so they did n't have to backtrack a mile into the woods and miss afternoon spa appointments . A chocolate Lab bounded through the foliage on the hillside as its owner , in cargo shorts , hiking books , and reflective sunglasses , walked past without even a second glance at the activity at the bottom of the glen . " So ? " Claire said . <p> " Head injury , " said Archie . <p> " Yep , " said Henry . <p> " Maybe she fell , " Claire theorized . " Like T. J. Hooker , there . Hit her head on a rock . " <p> " Or maybe the rock hit her , " Henry said . <p> " Or , " Archie said , " maybe Sparky scrambled down there and stuck his snout in our corpse , and the hair dropped off his tongue on his way back up the embankment . " <p> Claire and Henry both looked at Archie . <p> " Sparky ? " Henry said . <p> " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweetheart by Chelsea Cain <p> Copyright 2008 by Verite <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
