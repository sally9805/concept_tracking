After spending weeks making the case for military tribunals for terrorists , Attorney General John Ashcroft walked into the Oval Office last week to make the case against them  --  at least in the first terrorist case stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks . Ashcroft told the President that there was no need for a military trial for Zacarias Moussaoui , an alleged al-Qaeda operative arrested in Minnesota last August . The President asked Ashcroft , " Will any of the evidence you need to use jeopardize the security of the United States ? " When Ashcroft assured him that it would n't , the deal was done . <P> Moussaoui 's may be the first terrorist indictment since Sept. 11 , but it wo n't be the last . Just as the military campaign in Afghanistan is reaching its denouement , the curtain on the legal war is being raised . This initial prosecution is by no means easy  --  in either the courtroom or the worldwide court of public opinion . The French are protesting the possible imposition of the death penalty for Moussaoui , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which outlaws the death penalty , are expressing concern too . But the trial , however controversial , is unlikely to become an O.J.-size spectacle for one simple reason : TV cameras are forbidden at federal trials . <P> The possibility of a death sentence is a further shock to those in France who knew Moussaoui . Recalled as a typical , if somewhat rowdy , Eurokid raised by a Moroccan-immigrant single mother , Moussaoui embraced strict Islam at 19 in his native southern France . His radicalization accelerated in England , where he studied international trade and came under the sway of a leading al-Qaeda organizer . That London journey to extremism , French officials charge , is typical of the European Islamist militant . " British law and British society create an environment where extremist , at times violent , messages and militant indoctrination can enjoy the cover of religious freedom , " says a French investigator . <P> While Britain rejects that charge , what appears indisputable is that Moussaoui , with his French citizenship , enjoyed easier travel in the West than did other al-Qaeda suspects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutiny . The indictment alleges that Moussaoui traveled to Afghanistan in April 1998 to train at Khalden , an al-Qaeda camp . It does n't say how U.S. officials know this , but TIME has confirmed that one source was Ahmed Ressam , the terrorist snagged at the Canadian border in 1999 and convicted of trying to blow up Los Angeles International Airport . Ressam and Moussaoui studied at the camp together , and Ressam identified Moussaoui 's photo . <P> When Moussaoui entered the U.S. this year on a program that does not require European tourists to get visas for 90 days , he went unnoticed . He quickly signed up for flying lessons , first in Oklahoma and later in Minnesota , where he wanted to train on a 747 simulator though he was n't credentialed to fly even a small plane . His ham-handedness at the controls aroused the suspicions of the instructors . Federal authorities took him into custody on Aug. 16 for staying in the country past the 90-day mark . Although he was in detention when the Twin Towers were hit , prosecutors maintain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
