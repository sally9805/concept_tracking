Chapter One Today Derek LaValle was going to reverse the Curse , even if it meant saving the life of his **25;1283;TOOLONG cousin , Les LaValle . Well , okay , most of the family would claim Les was blight number two . Derek was blight number one . Except when they wanted money from him . Then Derek was blight number one with an asterisk . Derek 's cell phone rang just as he was walking up the broken front steps of the dump Les lived in . It was his second-in-command , Becca Gibbs . " What 's up ? " " The folks from McDonald 's are here to talk to you about selling our pretzels in their stores . " Her voice was slightly elevated ; too much caffeine as usual . Becca was one high-strung woman . It made her a great business partner , though . She never slept and got more work done in an hour than most people did in a month . " The meeting 's in five minutes and you 're not here . " He glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust . " I do n't have time to deal with them . Reschedule . " " Do n't you realize what a huge opportunity this would be ? " Her voice shot up a few more decibels . " You ca n't miss this meeting ! " " I need to deal with Les first . " He swung the baseball bat loosely from his fingers as he rapped on the front door and rang the doorbell . " Les ! Open up ! " " Derek ! Youblew off Dunkin ' Donuts last week because you were in the library doing research on that goblet , and you missed the Starbucks meeting on Friday because you saw a woman with a dragon tattoo at lunch and got arrested for stalking her . " She made a sound of aggravated distress . " These are incredible distribution opportunities and you need to take them seriously . McDonald 's wants an exclusive , and we need to think about whether that makes sense for us , and we ca n't do it if you 're off chasing some damned mumbo-jumbo myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he grinned . His business would have been neglected into bankruptcy if it was n't for Becca . " Go ahead and meet with them , " he said . " They 'll realize you 're a hell of a lot more on top of things than I am , and they 'll be thrilled to work with you instead of me . " Hiring Becca five years ago had been his best business decision since deciding to open Vic 's Pretzels . She was a business and marketing genius , and the stock price of Vic 's Pretzels proved it . Gave him time to pursue more important things , like saving his cousin 's life . Not that Becca agreed with his priorities . Who did ? No one . Of course , everyone who knew of his plans thought he was insane , so he supposed the fact they did n't support him was to be expected . He tried the doorknob . Locked . " Les ! " A quick glance at his watch told him he had only two and a half minutes now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far out of the city . He felt his adrenaline kick in , and his heart began to pump . But Becca was n't finished . " These people want to meet with the inventor of Vic 's No-Carb Pretzel , not his lieutenant . I will stall them for exactly thirty minutes and if you do n't get your designer-clad heinie over here by then , I 'm going to hand them the recipe and tell them to have at it . " She slammed down the phone . She 'd sounded like she meant it . Crap . Time to save Les 's butt and get back to the office . Barely two minutes left . " Les ! " He slung the baseball bat over his shoulder and sprinted around the side of the house . The gate to the backyard was locked , but he scaled it easily , an advantage of being over six feet tall . He vaulted up the rickety stairs to the back deck and nearly crashed into his cousin , who was sprawled in a lawn chair , absorbing the rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " Screw you . " Les had his feet cooling in a murky plastic wading pool , his bulging stomach hanging over the waistband of his Speedo . " I 'm not listening to any of your b.s . " " I do n't care if you listen or not , " Derek said . " I 'm here to save your sorry behind anyway . " " I do n't need saving . I take care of myself just fine . " For the last six years , Les had been collecting disability for an " injury " to his back . He now spent all his time furthering his Internet poker addiction and bullying the neighborhood children into going to the store for him . The only time he was n't at the computer was when he was too hungover to focus on the screen . Solution ? Sun and beer for a couple hours to revive himself . " And if you keep running around insisting the LaValle men have been cursed , someone 's going to pack you off in a straitjacket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His family had already tried to have him committed more than once . Having a vast disposable income came in handy for purchasing his freedom . " Every LaValle man for four generations has died at the moment he turned thirty-one years , forty-six weeks , four days , six hours , three minutes , and five seconds old . " He looked at his watch and cursed . " That 's in just over a minute for you . " He hoisted the bat to his shoulder and searched the yard for rabid pit bulls and homicidal yard implements that might develop a mind of their own . I know you 're out there , you murderous son of a bitch . I 'm ready for you . Les took another slug of beer . " The LaValle men have had a run of bad luck . Nothing more . " " So everyone says . " So his dad had claimed until the moment he 'd become the victim of a wayward butter knife . Died right in front of fifteen-year-old Derek , while they 'd been sampling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't need you here to protect me against some crap you made up . " Les folded his flabby arms over his saggy chest and glared at Derek . No Curse ? Not likely . Not when you consider the way they 'd died . One had been found impaled on his toothbrush . Another had choked to death on lemonade . How about the one who 'd been kicked in the head by a newborn baby and suffered fatal brain damage ? One unfortunate sod had actually shot himself in the head while cleaning his gun-although that could have been legit . The one that had been mauled to death by a pet hamster ? Seemed a little fishy . As if fate was grabbing whatever was available at that precise moment . " I 'm going to call my mom and tell her you 're over here talking about the Curse again , " Les whined . " And then I 'm going to call the cops and- " " Shut up and let me concentrate . " If he could keep the Curse from succeeding with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the chain before it hit him and his fraternal twin when they reached the right age . Which was in just over a week . Forty-five seconds . " Maybe you should go inside , " Derek suggested . " You could drown in that pool . " His bat was n't going to be much good if the water suddenly swelled up in a massive tsunami and swept Les away . " You go inside . Get me another beer . " Les belched and let his head drop back against the lounge chair . " Order a pizza while you 're at it . " Derek looked up at the sky . No lightning bolt could come out of that blue sky , could it ? Ten seconds . He kicked an old pizza box off the deck . Not sure how cardboard could be deadly , but he was n't taking any chances . Les yawned . " I 'm gon na take a nap . " Five seconds . Les belched again and picked up a beer . " Give me that bottle . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab the bottle , Derek 's watch alarm went off , and a huge rock came careening over the back fence , heading straight for Les 's head . Les screamed and dove out of his chair . Derek swung for the rock . It shattered his bat but ricocheted away from Les and smashed through the living room window . " Believe me now , Les ? " No sound from Les . Derek spun around . His cousin was lying on the deck , motionless , his neck twisted at an angle that was unnatural and very , very wrong . Frustration ripped through him . " Dammit , Les . Why did n't you listen ? " No one listened . And everyone died . Well , Derek was n't going to die , and he was n't going to let his brother die . He glared at the overgrown backyard . " You 've just taken your last LaValle man , you hear me ? " He could have sworn he heard laughter on the wind . Great . So he was burdened with a Curse that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four hours later , after dealing with cops and the ambulance and begging forgiveness from Becca for skipping out on the fast-food meeting , Derek banged open the door to his twin brother 's office , making Quincy LaValle jump and spill coffee all over his desk . " Damn you , Derek . Why do you always do that ? " " Because I like to pick on my little brother . Hello , Wendy . Derek nodded at the assistant filing in the corner as he moved a stack of papers off a chair , and dropped into the seat . Then he looked again . Wendy Monroe had been working for Quincy for the last two years . Every time he 'd seen her , she 'd been wearing some gray outfit that barely showed she was a woman . No makeup . Glasses . She was the epitome of a nerdy intellectual and a perfect match for his math professor brother , if only Quincy would pull his head out of his books and realize it . But today she was wearing a red sweater and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something . What did women call that ? Highlighted . Right . She looked like she 'd gotten her hair highlighted . A monumental change for her . She actually looked like she had a personality . " You look nice today , Wendy . " She smiled at him and looked him in the eye . Another first . " Thank you , Mr. LaValle . " She pulled open a drawer in Quincy 's desk and pulled out a napkin , barely keeping her hip a proper distance form Quincy 's arm . " Derek , " he corrected her , as usual . " Of course . " As she mopped up the coffee spill , her gaze flicked toward Quincy , and he was pretty sure he saw a light in her eyes he had n't noticed before . Had she suddenly realized what every other woman on campus already knew ? That his antisocial , absentminded brother was apparently a total chick magnet ? That would account for the new sweater and colored hair . " Quincy ? Do you need anything else ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typing away . He waved his hand vaguely in her direction . " All set . Have a good weekend . " She gave Derek a knowing smile . It was Monday at one in the afternoon . She still had a thirty-five-hour workweek until the weekend , but it was beneath Quin to keep track of things as mundane as the day of the week . " You have to teach class in forty-five minutes . I 'll remind you . " Quincy looked up from the computer . " Really ? Today ? What class ? " " It 's your freshman lecture . " " Oh . Right . " He frowned and Wendy set a sheaf of papers in front of him . " These are the tests you 're handing back to the students today . And on the top are your notes for your lecture . " Derek grinned as he watched Wendy take care of his brother with calm patience . The perfect woman for Quin . Maybe he ought to encourage Quincy to notice he had a female working in his office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Until they beat it , relationships were pretty much doomed . Nothing like telling your date that you 'll be dead by age thirty-one to scare her off . Somehow being beheaded by a green bean did n't seem to mesh with domestic visions of white picket fences and 2.3 kids , as their dad 's unfortunate butter knife encounter had proven . Just think of the situation Derek would put his kids in if he had any : How do you explain to your friends at school that your dad was the victim of a wayward kitchen utensil that had been momentarily possessed by a supernatural force ? Wendy finished instructing Quincy on his plans for the afternoon , then stepped back from the desk . " Do you need my assistance for your meeting with Derek ? If not , I 'll keep filing in the corner . " Derek cleared his throat . " Um , would you mind giving us some privacy ? " " No problem at all . " She flashed them a small smile and then hurried out of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quincy 's desk . " Brought lunch . " Quincy grinned and began unwrapping the sandwich . " Great . I 'm starving . I forgot to eat again . " " I figured that would be the case . " The door clicked shut . " Les died . " Quincy looked up sharply . " When ? " " This morning . " Sharp lines tightened behind Quincy 's glasses . " At what time ? " " Nine fifty-four and seventeen seconds . As I predicted . " Maybe this would convince Quincy . It had to . Derek needed help to figure what was going on and how to stop it . Time was almost out , and eighteen years of solo pursuit had n't gotten him any answers . He needed a partner , and since Quin was the only person who let Derek discuss the Curse without threatening to get him committed , Quin got the nod . His brother frowned . " You were there ? " " Yep . " " What happened ? " Typical intellectual . He needed every fact before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin on the details , then fell silent . " Huh . " " Huh ? That 's all you can say ? " " Well , what do you want me to say ? Oh , sure , I believe all the LaValle men are cursed and you 're going to die in a week and I 'm going to die ten minutes after you ? " Quincy shook his head . " I 'm sorry , but I do n't buy this paranormal spooky stuff . There has to be a logical explanation . " " Math is based on logic . Curses are n't . Forget what you know and open your mind . " Quincy pulled off his glasses and shot Derek a superior stare . " Math is real . Curses are myths . There has to be something else going on besides some fantastical intervention by fate . " Derek ground his teeth . " Listen to me , Quin . We have to find out how to stop it . One week and then we 're dead . The leisurely approach is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the statistical odds of all these deaths happening at such similar times and- " " Quincy ! " Derek slammed his palms on the desk . " This is n't math ! It 's something more ! You 'll die if we do n't fix this . " Derek had n't suffered all those black eyes and the broken nose defending his nerdy brother just to let him die from a rabid ballpoint pen or something equally ridiculous . A fatal carjacking in the city ? Fine . That 's fate . A damned ballpoint pen ? He had his pride and he simply would n't be bested by a blasted writing utensil . " Do n't ignore this , Quincy . I 'm not crazy . " Quincy leaned back in his chair and gave Derek his tolerant professor look . " What would you have me do ? " " Let 's find this Goblet of Eternal Youth . Find the Guardian . " " And then what ? Kill the Guardian and steal the Goblet as the journal says must be done for the Curse to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go around killing anyone . " " What if it 's the Guardian 's life or ours ? You think I should stand back and let us die ? " Quincy leaned forward . " Face it , Derek . There 's no Goblet . There 's no Curse . There is simply bad luck among the LaValle men . I 'll write up a few equations and show that it 's mathematically possible for all twenty-nine men to have died without any supernatural intervention . " " Fine . " Derek stood up . " You do that . " " And then you 'll let this go ? " " Sure . " He turned away before Quincy could see the lie in his eyes . Curse or not , Les was going to be the last LaValle man to die at age thirty-one . He was going to find that Guardian and do what he had to do . But his gut dropped at the thought of killing anyone in cold blood , even to save his brother . He hoped she tried to kill him first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Murder in the first degree was n't exactly befitting of a pretzel mogul . And what was the point of dodging the Curse if he had to spend the rest of his life in prison dodging ... well ... yeah . Probably best not to think about that . First things first . Find the Guardian . Deal with the rest Later . ( Continues ... )
