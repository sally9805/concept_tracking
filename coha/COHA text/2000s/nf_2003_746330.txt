IN 1992 FELLIPE PATINO settled in Russellville , Alabama , along with his wife Patricia and their children , Juan and Alma . They were among a small handful of Hispanics living in Russellville at the time . During the previous four years , Fellipe had traveled back and forth from Mexico to Florida for work while his family remained behind in Mexico . Still earlier , he had made numerous annual migrations to work in California agriculture . Patino was drawn to heavily rural , mostly white , northwest Alabama by the opportunity to work in the Gold Kist poultry plant in Russellville , where , he was told by fellow Mexicans , he could almost double the wages he earned as a migrant farm worker in Florida . The Russellville poultry plant had opened in 1990 , but Gold Kist managers had trouble securing a stable labor force locally . Like other chicken processors in Alabama and elsewhere , Gold Kist found in Hispanic workers like Patino the reliable low-cost labor pool they needed to maintain efficient production . By the end of the 1990s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hispanic , some 3,500 of about 10,000 people . By that time , the Patino family had bought a home . The children enrolled in local schools and endured ethnic harassment from American schoolmates , but ultimately they became fluent in English and adjusted to life in small-town Alabama . The family missed the Mexican homeland to a degree , but by the end of the 1990s the Mexican community in Russellville was large enough to provide many homeland comforts : native foods such as flat tacos , hot peppers , and goat meat ; Mexican movie videos ; Spanish-language soap operas on satellite television ; weekend soccer leagues ; familiar church services on Sundays ; Spanish-speaking workers in government agencies ; and Hispanic clerks in local retail stores. ( n1 ) <p> The Patinos adapted to life in Russellville 's " Little Mexico . " But as the new residents came to feel more at home , the town 's white population gradually became uneasy about the ethnic change that upset the stability of small-town southern life . Initially , newcomers from south of the South were received cautiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent their money locally , boosting rental housing , retail stores , and the used car-market . They provided about one third of the labor force in the Gold Kist plant and contributed to the economic turnaround of the local economy . By the late 1990s , however , as the Mexican population continued to grow , local reaction turned less positive . Increasingly , Russellville locals complained about the newcomers ' preference for the Spanish language and about the rising costs for health care , social services , schooling , and police services . A few raised the disturbing spectre of a rejuvenated Ku Klux Klan that might scare off the Hispanics and restore the familiar whiteness of the past . Whatever their intentions , these discontented whites had little appreciable effect in stemming the flow of new immigrants to the area . Despite rising ethnic tensions in Russellville and elsewhere in Alabama , the Patino family seemed permanently settled in their new place. ( n2 ) <p> The scene is much the same in northeast Alabama , where tens of thousands of additional Hispanics have settled . Near Gadsden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guadalupe Cantellano live in a small , ramshackle house with fifteen other family members , including six children , three of them married with children of their own . Raul had worked as a migrant farm laborer in Florida and Alabama in the 1980s and early 1990s , leaving his family behind in Mexico . In 1994 he brought his family to live in Alabama , settling at first into agricultural labor but eventually getting a job at the Cagle poultry plant in nearby Collinsville . After obtaining green cards permitting work in the United States Cantellano 's three adult sons and their wives all found jobs at the Cagle plant , where Hispanics comprised 63 percent of the work force by 1999 . Guadalupe Cantellano works at home , caring for younger children , cooking ten pounds of tortillas a day , and raising chickens in the backyard . They have paid off the mortgage on their $15,000 home , own four used cars , and collectively earn a good income at the Cagle plant . Raul speaks no English and remains illiterate in Spanish , and his adult sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hispanic newcomers , they expect that educational opportunity in the United States will enable their younger children to break the cycle of poverty and low-skill , low-pay work that characterizes Hispanic life in the American South. ( n3 ) <p> As these family stories suggest , Dixie is experiencing a dramatic demographic , economic , and cultural transformation . These transformations have resulted from two patterns of powerful change that are connected and that have coincided in the state of Alabama and in the South generally . Major shifts in the global economy have produced new forms of both de-industrialization and economic investment . New " free trade " policies such as the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) encouraged the migration of capital and labor . A restructuring of the regional , national and global economies has undermined older forms of production in the South , such as in agriculture , steel , textiles , and apparel . At the same time , new economic investment poured into the region as American and foreign capital sought cheap labor , new markets , and government incentives . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kentucky , Alabama , Mississippi , and South Carolina ; high-tech research and manufacturing in Atlanta , Austin , Huntsville , and North Carolina 's Research Triangle Park ; biomedical research in Birmingham and other major medical centers ; and the new food processing plants for poultry , hogs , and seafood that have sprung up all over the rural South . In the past decade , about half of all poultry processing has come to be concentrated in four low-wage , anti-union southern states  --  Alabama , Arkansas , Georgia , and North Carolina . In addition , rapid population growth in southern states and sunbelt cities has created an immense service economy and a consequent demand for low-wage labor. ( n4 ) <p> Global economic change has also created new transnational labor migration patterns . Immigration scholars have noted the historic and deeply entrenched symbiotic relationship between Mexican immigrants and the United States economy . Mexico 's proximity to southwestern labor markets , immigration scholar Kitty Calavita has suggested , made it possible to easily " expand and contract " the migrant labor force over time in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , Mexican labor migrants found willing employers in agriculture , manufacturing , and service work . During the 1920s , Mexican workers replaced European immigrants in midwestern steel and meat packing plants , and they found railroad construction and maintenance jobs throughout the West . The immigration quota system established in the 1920s effectively shut off European immigration , but did not apply to Mexico . When job losses nationwide mounted during the Great Depression , Mexican workers in the United States were " repatriated " in massive numbers . With new farm labor demands during and after World War II , the newly instituted bracero program legalized the temporary recruitment of as many as 4 million Mexican migrant farm workers annually . The bracero program officially ended in 1964 , but Mexican farm workers continued their migratory ways . As anthropologist Thomas Weaver has written , " the bracero movement institutionalized migrant networks for the flood of undocumented workers that followed its demise . " ( n5 ) <p> During the bracero period and until the late 1980s , most Mexican border crossers sought agricultural and manufacturing jobs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also heading to the Chicago area . Economic crisis in Mexico in the early 1980s brought to power a new government that promoted free market economic policies . This new economic program encouraged global trade and investment in Mexico , especially United States trade and investment , but it did little to improve the economic situation of most Mexicans . Economic changes in Mexico coincided with new immigration policies in the United States , primarily the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act ( IRCA ) , which beefed up border controls and imposed tough new sanctions on employers who willfully hired undocumented immigrants . Because of worsening economic conditions in Mexico and despite the new American immigration law , Mexicans continued to seek work and higher wages in the United States . However , as sociologist Douglas S. Massey and colleagues have noted , the new border controls eventually " diverted the migratory flows away from traditional points of destination , " such as California , thus transforming Mexican immigration " from a regional into a national phenomenon . " The same forces encouraged undocumented workers to stay longer , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossings that had been more easily managed in earlier years. ( n6 ) <p> IRCA influenced labor migration flows in other ways , as well . Under pressure from big agricultural interests and pro-immigrant groups , Congress added an amnesty provision to IRCA , legalizing 2.3 million Mexicans who could document at least five years of work and residence in the United States . Those amnestied subsequently had full labor rights and the freedom to move within the United States in search of better opportunities . They also gained the right to bring family members from Mexico , potentially as many as 9.2 million additional Mexican migrants . In addition , IRCA policies eventually encouraged amnestied Mexicans and their families to seek citizenship  --  an outcome speeded by Mexican legislation in the late 1990s permitting dual U.S.-Mexican citizenship . IRCA 's amnesty provisions suggested the contradictions in United States immigration policy , seeking to curb illegal Mexican migration while simultaneously granting permanent residency to millions . The surge of Hispanic migration to the South coincided with the new immigration provisions introduced by IRCA , as both illegal and amnestied Mexicans found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1990s , the dispersal of Hispanic population from traditional areas of settlement had intensified dramatically . Documenting this new migration pattern , an Urban Institute study in 2001 demonstrated that " California 's net population loss from internal migration of foreign-born households during the 1990s was 363,000 , " mostly Mexican-born immigrants . Amnesty provisions of IRCA encouraged internal migration from heavily Hispanic states such as California , while new job opportunities in the South determined new destinations . Labor recruitment played a role in the dispersal of Hispanic population , as well , as poultry companies and construction firms advertised for workers in Spanish-language newspapers in Mexico , California , and the Southwest. ( n7 ) <p> Taken together , the globalization of markets and capital and new American immigration policy diversified the migratory flows of Mexican labor . Within a few years of passage of IRCA , for example , hiring of legal and illegal Hispanic workers had become " a cornerstone of changing labor relations " in southern poultry processing plants . Hispanic labor flows to the South intensified in the wake of NAFTA , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further immigration . Large American companies recruited workers directly from Mexico , reflected in 2002 in the message conveyed on a huge billboard in Tijuana , Mexico sponsored by Gold Kist : " Mucho Trabajo en Russellville , Alabama " There 's plenty of work in Russellville , Alabama . Similar billboards elsewhere in Mexico advertised job opportunities in North Carolina . Consequently , newcomers from below the border , mostly amnestied or illegal Mexicans , have now become ubiquitously visible in isolated small towns and rural places , as well as in sprawling metropolitan regions such as Atlanta , Nashville , Memphis , Louisville , Birmingham , Charlotte , Greensboro , Raleigh-Durham , Greenville , South Carolina , and Arlington , Alexandria , Norfolk , Virginia Beach , and Fairfax County in Virginia . As labor researcher Hector Figueroa noted in 1996 , " Latino labor in the United States is a product of the complex forces that have integrated Latin America into the orbit of U.S. capitalism . " Nothing has changed since that time to alter Figueroa 's conclusion. ( n8 ) <p> New immigration has fueled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences , too . Black and white once defined the racial landscape of the American South , but multicultural and multiethnic rather than biracial now describe society in many southern places . As one Alabama editorialist noted in 2000 , " Life in the South used to be defined in shades of black and white . But a growing wave of Hispanic immigrants is adding brown to that color scheme . " " A world of racial technicolor is exploding in the South , " the Christian Science Monitor reported in 1999 , " as the ethos of black and white that has defined the region for more than a century diminishes . " " The future is brown , " Richard Rodriguez has argued in a recent book , Brown : The Last Discovery of America ( 2002 ) , which makes the case that Hispanic migrations to the United States over time have tended to blur racial distinctions and break down racial and ethnic barriers across generations , especially through intermarriage and sexual contact . The seemingly permanent Hispanic influx to the South , a Washington Post reporter suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what a southerner is . " In northeast Atlanta journalist Anne Hull wrote , the heavy concentration of Hispanic and Asian immigrants along a fifteen-mile stretch of Buford Highway " has come to symbolize the transformation of the white and black South . " In Hull 's opinion , with its multiple clusters of immigrant apartment complexes , shopping centers , churches , restaurants , and groceries , Atlanta " represents the two-tone world of the past that is now giving way to a new society . " The silent wave of Latin migration that has transformed much of America is now working its way through the South. ( n9 ) <p> Although it had already begun in the 1980s , Hispanic migration to the Deep South was barely noticeable to most at the time , but the migratory flow surged dramatically in the 1990s . Texas and Florida long had heavy concentrations of Hispanics  --  Texas because of its proximity and historic connections to Mexico , and Florida because of the massive waves of Cubans , Nicaraguans , and other Latin exiles , immigrants , and internal migrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and different migration streams deposited Latin newcomers all over the southern United States . Texas and Florida continued to attract Hispanics in substantial numbers , but in virtually every other southern state the Hispanic growth rate surpassed the national growth rate in Hispanic population by three , four , five , or six times . And unlike the 1980s , by the mid-1990s it was difficult for southerners in destination towns and cities to ignore the sudden intensity of ethnic change . Verifying these patterns , by the mid-1990s journalists and a few social scientists had begun writing about the powerful surge of Hispanic migration to the South. ( n10 ) <p> U.S. Census Bureau statistics tell part of the story of this astonishing shift in population patterns . During the 1990s , for example , the Hispanic population surged nationally by a hefty 61.2 percent , rising from 22.4 million in 1990 to 35.3 million in 2000 . By 2001 , new census counts confirmed that Hispanics surpassed African Americans as the nation 's largest minority , " a symbolic benchmark of some significance , " asserted writer and policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but statistical evidence of recent Latino migration to the South has been even more dramatic . The most startling example is that of North Carolina , where the census recorded a sizzling 394 percent growth rate for Hispanics in the 1990s . The decennial growth rate was similarly very high in other southern states : 337 percent in Arkansas , 300 percent in Georgia , 278 percent in Tennessee , 212 percent in South Carolina , 208 percent in Alabama , and by lesser but still substantial amounts in other southern states ( see Table 1 ) . Aside from Texas and Florida , the Hispanic population in southern states in 2000 ranged from a low of 39,500 in Mississippi to a high of 435,000 in Georgia . Virginia , with almost 330,000 Hispanics , and North Carolina , with 379,000 , also ranked high on the list . Overall , the 2000 census revealed a decennial increase of almost 4.6 million Hispanics in the South , bringing the total Hispanic population of twelve southern states to a little over 11 million. ( n11 ) <p> Many recent Hispanic migrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas for agricultural and poultry work . But large numbers of newcomers have chosen urban destinations as well . Metro Atlanta , with 269,000 Hispanics in 2000 , provides the most startling example of this pattern of urban migration . According to the Census , fully 62 percent of all Hispanics in Georgia reside in the twenty-county Atlanta metropolitan area . This new urban pattern is common throughout the South . North Carolina cities along the Interstate-85 corridor had huge increases in Hispanic migration during the 1990s . The newcomers are now heavily represented in the state 's metro population , typified by the 77,000 Hispanics in metro Charlotte , 73,000 in Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill , and 62,000 in Greensboro-Winston-Salem . Virginia , too , has striking numbers of Hispanics , including 219,000 in the Virginia portion of the Washington , D.C. metro area . Suburban Fairfax County alone has almost half of that number , about 107,000 or over 11 percent of Fairfax 's total population . Similar urban concentrations of Hispanics can be found in most of the South 's other metropolitan areas ( see Table 2 ) . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of Hispanic diversity in the South . The Census broke down the Hispanic population into four categories : Mexican , Puerto Rican , Cuban , and " Other Hispanic or Latino , " a reference to those from other Central American and South American nations . Generally , observers have tended to identify the South 's new Hispanic immigrants and migrants as primarily or almost exclusively Mexican . This may actually be the case in selected small towns , but statewide census statistics demonstrate not only diversity of national origin but also wide disparities among southern states . For example , with the exception of Texas and Arkansas , where the proportions of Mexicans surpass 70 percent of all Hispanics , in no southern state do Mexicans exceed about two-thirds of all Hispanics , and in some states the Mexican proportion is quite low : 30 percent in Louisiana , 22.4 percent in Virginia , and 13.6 percent in Florida . The statistics for the Other Hispanic category also suggest surprising ethnic differentials among southern states . For instance , the proportion of Other Hispanic ranges from a low of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Virginia , with most states in the 25 to 35 percent range . Even in Florida , generally thought of as dominated by Cubans , that group is surpassed numerically by Hispanics from Central and South America . Finally , excepting Florida , the proportions of Cubans and Puerto Ricans in the South tend to be much lower than the other two categories ( see Table 3 ) . This Hispanic diversity , of course , can also be traced in the population statistics for individual southern cities , counties , and metropolitan areas. ( n13 ) <p> Census statistics reveal only part of the Hispanic migration story , however . Actual Hispanic population counts are much higher , perhaps as much as twice as high in many southern cities , counties , and states , according to local sources . For example , the 2000 Census counted 39,500 Hispanics in Mississippi , but state economic planner Pete Walley conceded that the actual number " could be well over 100,000 . " Similarly , Memphis had 23,400 Hispanics according to the Census , but local leaders contend that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . " The Census reported 13,000 Hispanics in Charleston , South Carolina , but knowledgeable observers offer 50,000 as a more likely Hispanic population total for the city . Some 435,000 Hispanics resided in Georgia , according to the 2000 Census , but at least one Georgia demographer suggests the actual number is closer to 800,000 , or about 10 percent of the state 's population . The Census Bureau , in fact , has routinely undercounted minorities , including new immigrants , many of whom are undocumented and thus avoid any contact with government agencies . As South Carolina journalist James Shannon of the Greenville News noted in 2002 , " documentation issues make many members of this demographic group less inclined to sit still for official head counters . " Indeed , the Census Bureau admitted early in 2001 that its national population count for 2000 could be off by as much as 2.7 to 3.9 million people , most of whom were Hispanics , African Americans , and Native Americans . Nevertheless , Census statistics provide important evidence for tracking rapid demographic and ethnic change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states and cities provides a more revealing snapshot of the recent Hispanic migration and its impact . Centrally located in the Deep South , Alabama became an important destination for Hispanic immigrants and migrants in the 1990s . The Census Bureau count for 2000 placed the number of Hispanics in the state at about 76,000 . Those who work with the Hispanic communities  --  public health professionals , social workers , church people , school and police officials  --  place the actual Hispanic population of Alabama , mostly Mexicans , at considerably more than 100,000 at the turn of the twenty-first century . Hispanics are spread throughout the state , in both rural and urban areas . Metropolitan Birmingham has the largest concentration of newcomers , some 16,600 according to the 2000 census  --  an increase of over 300 percent from 1990 . Other major cities such as Montgomery , Mobile , and Huntsville , have anywhere between 4,000 and 7,000 Hispanics each . Local estimates suggest that it would be more accurate to double the census numbers for Alabama 's largest cities . In north Alabama , where the poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Gadsden , Anniston , Cullman , Decatur , Russellville , Albertville , Collinsville , Oneonta , and a few others have substantial numbers of Hispanics as well . " Little Mexicos " are sprouting up in north Alabama neighborhoods , trailer parks , and apartment complexes. ( n15 ) <p> Jobs and economic opportunity have provided the magnetic pull attracting Hispanics to Alabama , and to the rest of the South as well . As immigration scholar George J. Borjas has written , " the same economic incentives that drive global trade flows motivate workers to move across international borders . " The booming American economy of the 1990s , with the lowest unemployment rates in decades , created a demand for cheap , reliable , non-union labor . An ongoing economic crisis in Mexico through the 1980s and 1990s supplied an important push factor driving legal as well as undocumented newcomers to the United States . Many labor migrants came directly from rural and small town Mexico , but many others , such as Fellipe Patino and Raul Cantellano , had already worked in Texas , Florida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> This new immigrant labor force has become an essential ingredient in Alabama 's rural and urban economies . In small north Alabama towns , Hispanics are heavily employed on chicken farms and in poultry processing plants ; in hosiery , garment , textile , carpet , furniture , and plastics manufacturing ; and in agriculture , where they pick and pack tomatoes , peaches , strawberries , potatoes , cucumbers , and watermelons . Notably , former migrant agricultural workers are settling down permanently in north Alabama towns , many moving into factory jobs and chicken plants . Hispanics are fewer in number but still very much in evidence in south Alabama , where they provide migrant agricultural labor , replant timber land , process seafood , and work dairy farms , truck farms , and sawmills . In metropolitan areas such as Birmingham , they work in restaurants , landscaping , roofing , building construction , and car washes . They clean rooms and make beds in Birmingham area hotels . A major portion of the janitorial work in Birmingham 's downtown and edge-city office buildings is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms . The hotels , cleaning companies , construction and landscaping firms , and poultry processors all found in Hispanics a cheap , reliable , and non-unionized labor force at a time when national labor markets were very tight . The Hispanic immigrants , in turn , found numerous ethnic niches in the American economy. ( n17 ) <p> As with other immigrants in past eras , the initial Hispanic newcomers were primarily young , single men who shared cramped housing , worked in teams or crews , and sent earnings to families back home . News of job opportunities in Alabama spread quickly to their sending villages and towns in Mexico and elsewhere . Through a familiar process of chain migration , homeland relatives , neighbors , and friends joined compadres in specific Alabama towns and work places . In a style reminiscent of employment practices of the industrial era , Alabama plants and firms relied on their Hispanic work force as a recruitment mechanism . Mexicans , especially , returned home often , eventually bringing wives , children , and even aging parents to the United States . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American schools , and buying homes and property. ( n18 ) <p> The pattern of migration , work , and settlement is much the same elsewhere . For example , Gainesville , Georgia , claimed at one time to be the " Poultry Capital of the World . " Gainesville lost its top poultry ranking in recent years , even as production increased and Hispanic migration surged . Low wages and difficult working conditions drove black and white American workers from the industry . But in the 1980s and 1990s , rising demand for processed chickens , or broilers , both nationally and globally , led to recruitment of primarily Mexican workers , who often shifted from migrant agricultural labor to poultry work . Kinship and community networks facilitated the recruitment of additional Hispanic workers for replacement jobs and for new poultry plants . Moreover , substantial numbers of Hispanic women have found employment in the chicken industry . In 2000 , over 27,000 Hispanics in Gainesville and Hall County made up 20 percent of the population , and they dominated the work force in the county 's chicken plants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s , primarily from California . The numbers rose dramatically in the 1990s , with most coming directly from Mexico and a smaller number from other Central American countries . For the chicken processing companies , Hispanics represented an ideal low-pay , low-turnover , non-union work force , but the workers found benefits as well . They were able to bring families to the United States , send children to local schools , and look forward to upward mobility . By the end of 2002 , for instance , Hispanic children accounted for 47 percent of the total enrollment in the Gainesville city schools . The new Hispanic immigrants have built dynamic ethnic communities , become a stable presence in the Gainesville area , and shown little inclination to return permanently to Mexico or other Latin homelands. ( n19 ) <p> In the far northwest corner of Georgia , signs proclaim Dalton to be the " Carpet Capital of the World . " In the early 1990s , local carpet factories experienced strong demand , but production was hampered by high worker turnover and persistent labor shortages . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of whom were already working in north Georgia poultry plants or in agriculture . Through chain migration , others came from California , Texas , and Mexico  --  mostly amnestied Mexicans and family members , but others undocumented . The surge of Mexicans to Dalton and other southern places has been an unanticipated consequence of IRCA , the immigration reform act of 1986 that facilitated now-legal Mexican migration to new labor markets outside California and the Southwest . By the official count of the census takers , Dalton and Whitfield County had 18,500 Hispanics in 2000 , or 22 percent of county population , but unofficial estimates from the INS and university researchers proclaim as many as 40,000 to 45,000 Hispanics in the Dalton area . As in Gainesville , these newcomers have put down roots , built stable communities , and helped to revive dying and abandoned business sections of Dalton and other rural towns . At the same time , they have had a costly impact on local schools and services . Carpet manufacturers rave about the newcomers ' work ethic , but some local residents have expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n20 ) <p> Dalton and Gainesville are far from isolated examples of the diverse , new Hispanic migration to the South . Poultry workers in Morganton , North Carolina , include some 400 Maya from two mountain towns in Guatemala . Arriving through chain migration , many by way of another Maya community in Florida , they have reconstituted their old communities and sustained traditional cultural values. ( n21 ) At the Smithfield Packing Company plant in Tar Heel , North Carolina , the largest hog butchering plant in the world , some 3,000 Hispanic workers hack meat from hog carcasses on moving conveyor belts . Mostly Mexican and mostly illegal , according to New York Times investigative reporter Charlie LeDuff , the Hispanic meat cutters are replacing black workers who regularly quit in large numbers ; the Smithfield plant has a 100 percent annual turnover rate. ( n22 ) In small fishing villages along the North Carolina coast , hundreds of Mexican women with special H-2B visas have replaced African American women in the seasonal crab processing industry.

In Georgia , Hispanics comprise over 80 percent of the state 's 90,000 migrant and seasonal farm workers . In North Carolina , 90 percent of farm laborers are Hispanic . In rural Forest Hill , Louisiana , Mexicans fill all the laboring jobs at the state 's largest plant nursery . In Morgan City , Louisiana , hundreds of Mexican skilled craftsmen work as welders , fitters , and carpenters in local shipyards . In Lexington , Kentucky , they work on horse farms and tobacco farms . In North Carolina and Virginia , tobacco growers now hire primarily Latinos for tobacco farm work . Some 15,000 Hispanic migrants , working on temporary visas , replant timberland for reforestation companies in Arkansas , Georgia , Alabama , and elsewhere in the South.

In suburban Fairfax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hispanics from many different nations work as maids , janitors , landscapers , and truck drivers ; they also work as computer engineers , doctors , businessmen , and government bureaucrats. ( n25 ) <p> Hispanics in the rural and urban South have become an important component in region 's low-wage , low-skill economy , especially in manufacturing , construction , agriculture , and food processing . They work mostly for minimal pay , often under difficult and dangerous working conditions , especially in poultry and meat processing plants . " Meatpacking , " Eric Schlosser noted in his expos Fast Food Nation ( 2001 ) , " is now the most dangerous job in the United States . " Job training and instruction in work-safety rules and regulations , especially in the Spanish language , are minimal in the slaughterhouses .

Fatality rates among Hispanic construction workers rose substantially in the late 1990s . Threats of deportation by crew chiefs and plant managers keep illegal workers in line , despite work hazards . Hispanic workers , the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) reported in 2001 , faced " a 20 percent greater risk of being killed on the job than black and white workers combined . " ( n26 ) <p> Given these circumstances , labor union organizers have targeted new Hispanic immigrants in an effort to revive union activism in the traditionally anti-union South . With the number of Latino workers rising , they " represent the future " for labor unions at a time when the unionized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist Sheila M. Poole reported in 1998 . Union proponents contend that effective organizing among Hispanics will result in higher wages and safer working conditions , the outcome in a nationally profiled organizing drive among Latino janitors by the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) in Los Angeles. ( n27 ) <p> Union organizers in the Hispanic South have not had much success . At the Smithfield plant in Tar Heel , organizers from the United Food and Commercial Workers Union ( UFCW ) recruited Hispanic workers during a collective bargaining election in 1997 . Fearing that unionization would bring unwanted attention to their illegal immigration status , most Hispanics voted against the idea , and the union went down to defeat by a two-to-one vote . But at the Case Farms poultry plant in Morganton , North Carolina , where 90 percent of employees are Maya immigrants from Guatemala , workers staged several wildcat strikes and work stoppages in 1995 to protest low wages and abusive treatment . Organizers from the Laborers International Union of North America ( LIUNA ) seized the opportunity , and workers eventually voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing campaign had a negative ending , however , as Case Farms engaged in obstructive anti-union tactics and in 2001 ended union negotiations altogether . However , in some areas of the South , poultry and catfish workers are represented by UFCW . In other efforts , both the Farm Labor Organizing Committee ( FLOC ) and the National Poultry Workers Organizing Committee are currently engaged in organizing North Carolina 's Latino workers . In Greensboro , the Union of Needletrades , Industrial and Textile Employees ( UNITE ) has been training Hispanic organizers and incorporating Latino culture into union programs. ( n28 ) <p> As these organizational efforts suggest , building a Latino union base in the South has been a difficult process , with few success stories . Some labor leaders , such as Kevin Blair of the FLOC , believe that " employers pit African American and Latino farmworkers and meatpackers against each other to increase productivity and to keep them from organizing labor unions . " Yet the new immigrant work force in the region remains ripe for organization , which may be speeded by a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration and critical of immigrant job competition , in February 2000 national labor leaders reversed course , supported a more lenient immigration policy , and vowed to " make immigrants more enthusiastic about joining unions . " Labor economist Vernon M. Briggs , Jr . has challenged that policy shift , contending that " as long as mass immigration is allowed to flood low wage labor markets , " little pressure can be asserted to improve wages and working conditions for American workers. ( n29 ) <p> The surge of Hispanic workers in the South has placed wage issues in the spotlight . Black spokespersons and some scholars have argued that Hispanics have displaced black workers and kept wages low for all workers . As early as 1979 , Ebony magazine complained that undocumented Mexican immigrants in southern agricultural states such as Florida and North Carolina posed " a big threat to black workers .

Similarly , in many parts of the urban South , Hispanics have been settling in traditionally black neighborhoods where rents seem more reasonable . Not surprisingly , black resentment about job competition and unwelcome neighbors has surfaced in the urban and rural South. ( n30 ) <p> These issues have emerged in striking ways in Tar Heel , North Carolina . Charlie LeDuff 's report on the Smithfield packing plant there portrayed a tension-filled shop-floor situation . Blacks resented Hispanic job competition and blamed the newcomers for lowered wage rates . Smithfield 's Hispanic workers  --  who now make up 60 percent of the plant 's work force  --  had resentments and suspicions of their own . Verbal and physical confrontations between the two groups became commonplace by the end of the 1990s . As LeDuff wrote in 2000 , " While Smithfield 's profits nearly doubled in the past year , wages have remained flat . So a lot of Americans here have quit and a lot of Mexicans have been hired to take their places . But more than management , the workers see one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin-tones .... The enmity spills out into the towns . " Le Duff captured Tar Heel 's uneasy racial standoff in a comment from one of his black informants from the plant : " There 's a day coming soon where the Mexicans are going to catch hell from the blacks , the way the blacks caught it from the whites . " The sudden surge of Hispanic workers and their dominance in many workplaces has nurtured black concerns about job competition and low wages. ( n31 ) <p> However , many immigration scholars reject the wage-competition argument . They contend that the new Latino immigrants are filling jobs that no one else wants . Job turnover in the fields and in food processing plants has been extremely high , they contend , as much as 100 percent a year in some industries . Hispanics , they say , are filling " replacement ' jobs abandoned by black workers who have rejected low pay and excessively demanding work . Some labor researchers have described a pattern of ethnic succession in southern labor markets in which Hispanics " are replacing African-American or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textiles , furniture manufacturing , custodial , and meat processing , rather than displacing them from the more desirable jobs in the industry . " A North Carolina sociologist echoed that view in 2000 : " It looks like the whites are moving out , the blacks are moving up , and the Latinos are filling in at the bottom. ( n32 ) <p> In addition , Hispanics in many metro areas filled new jobs created by expanding urban and regional economies during the 1990s . For example , a Russell Sage Foundation study in 1996 concluded that new immigrants " are fitting into occupational slots created by economic and demographic growth . " Similarly , a University of Memphis study , conducted in 2000 , reported that given the growing labor market in the South , " Latino workers have tended not to displace local workers , but rather to fuel economic growth in most regional economies . " ( n33 ) But not all experts agree on this subject . Indeed , the economic consequences of immigration has been a hotly debated subject among economists and policy experts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of immigration and others the economic costs as measured in job losses and wage cuts among American citizens. ( n34 ) <p> Whatever the reality , blacks and Hispanics have been at odds over jobs , neighborhoods , and cultural differences for almost a decade . In some places , emerging hostility has led to open conflict and black-on-Hispanic violence . In other places , civic leaders , union organizers , and advocacy groups have sought to mediate emerging ethnic and racial conflicts . In North Carolina , groups such as Black Workers for Justice and the Latino Workers Association have created an African-American/ Latino Alliance to find common ground among blacks and Hispanics . In Durham , the Piedmont Peace Project and the North Carolina Black-Latino Reconciliation Project have been engaged in similar work . In April 2002 in Raleigh , the Martin Luther King , J. Resource Center sponsored a " town hall meeting " discussing issues dividing blacks , whites , and Hispanics . In Birmingham , the Civil Rights Institute , the Community Foundation of Greater Birmingham , and New Birmingham Operation have each reached out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and housing . Nevertheless , as a consequence of recent Hispanic migration , new patterns of racial and ethnic conflict linger unresolved throughout the South. ( n35 ) <p> Interracial conflict in southern factories and farms has intensified concern about the impact of illegal immigration to the region . Many of the newcomers are legal or amnestied immigrants ; others are " guest workers " who work in the United States on H-2A or H-2B visas , special federal programs that permit entry of seasonal agricultural or seafood workers when U.S. Department of Labor officials certify that no Americans can be found to do those jobs . However , a large but unknown number of Hispanic workers in the South are illegal immigrants . Teodoro Maus , Mexico 's consul general in Atlanta , admitted to a reporter in 2000 that probably more than half of Georgia 's almost half-million Latinos were illegal . In small north Alabama towns , illegals make up half or more of all Hispanic newcomers . IRCA , passed in 1986 , required employers to ask new employees for documentation proving their eligibility to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this requirement , but they have no obligation to verify the documentation provided by new employees . The business of providing false documentation  --  social security cards or green cards , for instance  --  thrives in new immigrant communities . In Memphis , for example , for a little as $100 , undocumented workers can buy fake social security cards that will pass muster at company hiring offices . In Chapel Hill , North Carolina , the cost of fake social security and resident alien cards ranges from $50 to $150 . Once they successfully navigate the border crossing from Mexico , illegals easily travel to southern states on a Hispanic network of bus and van routes traversing the interstate highways . From a tiny bus station on Buford Highway , for instance , regular bus and van service connects Atlanta with more than two dozen Mexican destinations . In Memphis , four bus companies provide regular transportation service to numerous Mexican cities . Their destinations already determined through home-village networks , the newly arrived quickly find work in the ethnic niches already carved out in local economies. ( n36 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak to non-existent . In Georgia , INS district officials agreed that carpet and poultry processing firms heavily employed undocumented workers , but they also admitted , as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2000 , that those industries " have n't faced major raids in years . " Reporter Matt Kempner interviewed one Mexican worker , who said he had " been moving back and forth between countries for more than eight years , traveling to South Carolina , Florida , North Carolina , and Georgia . He 's never run into overly curious immigration agents or bosses too picky to accept his false documents . " After one highly publicized raid in 1992 on two large farms in North Carolina , the INS did little through the rest of the 1990s to enforce immigration law in the state . In Alabama , INS raids on workplaces have been few and far between , but occasional raids on poultry plants typically rounded up hundreds of illegal workers for deportation . In June and September 1995 , for instance , the INS raided Hudson Foods and Gold Kist poultry plants in northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In July 1997 , an INS raid at the Tyson Foods plant in Ashland , Alabama netted 106 illegal Hispanic workers  --  72 Mexicans , 33 Guatemalans , and one Honduran . Another fifty or so workers ran off and eluded capture . Those arrested numbered about 15 percent of the Tyson plant 's work force , thus suggesting the sizeable dimensions of illegal immigration in the poultry industry . Tyson Foods claimed that it followed the letter of the law by demanding documentation and denied any efforts to recruit illegal workers . Nevertheless , in December 2001 the U.S. Justice Department charged Tyson Foods and six of its managers with running a smuggling ring that recruited illegal Hispanic workers for fifteen Tyson plants in ten , mostly southern states . In March 2003 , a federal judge dismissed some charges and a jury eventually acquitted Tyson Foods and its managers of the remaining charges . Immigrant smuggling became an issue in Alabama , too . In 1999 when INS agents raided an apparel plant in Henegar , Alabama , they uncovered not only illegal workers , but also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexicans from the central Mexican town of Quertaro for work in company plants in Georgia and Alabama. ( n37 ) <p> Although government prosecutors lost their case , the Tyson indictment in 2001 seemed to represent a new determination on the part of INS to enforce immigration law . Indeed , throughout the urban and rural South , an underground labor market built on illegal immigrant workers thrives without much regulation or control . As one Border Patrol agent in Mobile noted in 2000 , " I could n't tell you a corner of the state of Alabama that does n't have some illegal immigration population . " Yet until recently Alabama had only one permanent INS agent , stationed in Birmingham , and six Border Patrol agents , all assigned to Mobile . North Carolina , one of the top destinations for Hispanic migrants in the 1990s , had only eighteen immigration agents in 2000 . National efforts to beef up the Border Patrol and crack down on illegal immigration have failed miserably , but perhaps this was a purposeful national strategy during the 1990s when labor markets were tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affairs put it , " Immigration policy today is driven by businesses that need more workers  --  skilled and unskilled , legal and illegal . Somehow , the process has gotten out of control . " The sense that illegal Hispanic migration in the South is " out-of-control " has brought demands for INS action and intensified anti-immigrant feelings in some places . These perceptions have hardened in the wake of the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. ( n38 ) <p> Not surprisingly , given their often tenuous immigration status , low incomes , language difficulties , and cultural differences , Hispanics in the South have experienced adjustment problems . However , churches , schools , libraries , and public agencies have responded in positive ways to the new immigrants . The Catholic church and numerous Protestant denominations have embraced the newcomers , offering Spanish-language religious services , English classes , employment assistance , and varied social services . Public schools in small towns and large cities are struggling to provide ESL classes to a growing number of Latino children . Public health agencies are confronting serious problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without health insurance . Medical providers , police , and emergency management personnel are getting training in Spanish. ( n39 ) The League of United Latin American Citizens ( LULAC ) now has state directors in several southern states . Various public and private non-profit groups have also organized to serve and advocate for new Latino southerners : the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama in Birmingham , El Centro Legal Latino in Birmingham , the North Alabama Hispanic Association in Huntsville , the Alabama Democratic Hispanic Caucus , the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice , the Georgia Poultry Alliance , the Hispanic Center for Social Assistance in Memphis , the Latino Memphis Conexion , the Latin American Resource Center in Raleigh , El Pueblo , Inc. in North Carolina , the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Latin American Association in Atlanta , the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance , and dozens of similar groups throughout the South . When the National Council of La Raza held its national meeting in Miami in July 2002 , Latino leaders from southern states met to plan a southeast regional network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many agencies and groups have responded positively to the South 's Hispanic newcomers , a more hostile response has also become evident in some places . For instance , Spanish language use has become controversial . Every southern state except Texas and Louisiana enacted official English legislation in the 1980s and 1990s . In Alabama , after a north Alabama legislator complained that " the Spanish are creeping in , " the state legislature in 1989 initiated a statewide referendum on an official English amendment to the state 's constitution . Supported by the Alabama English Committee , an affiliate of the national organization U.S. English , the amendment was approved by 88.5 percent of Alabama voters in 1990 . Throughout the 1990s , language debates flared in Alabama over such issues as Spanish-language drivers tests and homestead tax exemptions for non-English speakers . When a Birmingham area auto dealership ran Spanish-language ads on television in 2000 , local talk radio personalities discovered Birmingham 's " immigration problem . " They attacked the car dealership for pandering to foreigners and incited a controversy over the rising number of immigrants in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Spanish-language newspaper , El Reportero blasting the race-hate mentality that would " drag this state back to the shameful days when Alabama was best known for its Ku Klux Klan rallies and church bombings in Birmingham . " A Washington Post reporter noted at the time that " many in the Birmingham area are uncomfortable with the notion that their city could take on the characteristics of a Miami . " ( n41 ) <p> More overt expressions of anti-immigrant sentiment surfaced , as well . In May 1997 in Oneonta , Alabama , a small town north of Birmingham , a local white supremacist group affiliated with the American First Committee announced plans for a demonstration march to protest the " Mexican invasion " of the area . At the time , Oneonta had several hundred Hispanic families , but the number rose during summers as migrant workers arrived to pick strawberries , tomatoes , and other crops . William Riccio , state organizer and spokesman for the white supremacist group , lived in Birmingham , not Oneonta , and he had an unsavory background . A former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been associated with various KKK , " militant patriot , " and " skinhead " hate groups since the 1970s . The demonstration was needed , Riccio asserted , because the Hispanics were " causing the crime rate to go up and creating a drain on the economy . " Many were illegal immigrants , he said ; they were " holding jobs that should go to white residents , " and their presence affected " the stability of Blount County . " Riccio 's request for a parade permit anticipated that 300 to 500 people , including Klansmen and skinheads , would march in Oneonta 's anti-immigrant demonstration . As the planned demonstration came to be seen as a Klan event , many people in Oneonta defended local Hispanics as hard-working and law-abiding neighbors . The America First parade was postponed and then cancelled altogether , and subsequent plans for an anti-immigrant rally at the courthouse in downtown Oneonta were also cancelled . But the controversy revealed underlying resentment in some quarters about the way Alabama was changing. ( n42 ) <p> Anti-immigrant hostility also flared up in nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County had fewer than 1,000 Hispanics in 1999 , according to U.S. Census estimates . That was too many for some people . In January 1998 , after an immigration protest meeting , three men were arrested for burning the Mexican flag , as well as flags of the United Nations and the Communist party . Many of those attending the rally were KKK leaders and right-wing militia members , some from Georgia and a few from as far away as California and Canada . James Floyd , the local leader of the " Stand Up for Cullman " protest , vociferously argued for a permanent halt to Hispanic immigration , which , he believed , would ultimately challenge Cullman 's white majority population . " I like my own people more than others , " Floyd later asserted , " and I 'm not ready for a world without borders . " Apparently , he was not alone ; at least one hundred people who sympathized with that view attended the Cullman protest . So much for globalization in that part of Alabama. ( n43 ) <p> In Siler City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of Raleigh , similar anti-immigrant sentiment flared in 2000 . Hispanic migration in the late 1990s took the local community by surprise , so much so , one writer noted , that " longtime residents can scarcely grasp what has happened . " Mexicans , Guatemalans , and Nicaraguans made up 80 percent of the work force in Siler City 's two poultry plants ; Hispanic children comprised over 40 percent of the town 's elementary school students . The town 's almost abandoned downtown retail district began to sprout Hispanic shops and restaurants . Siler City 's lone radio station aired complaints about the newcomers on morning talk shows , but turned the airwaves over to Spanish-language music and programming in the evening . One woman seemed to sum up the general attitude in a complaint to a reporter : " They just came in and took over . " Chatham County commissioners demanded that the INS crack down on Hispanic illegals , without result . In February 2000 , a local white supremacist invited David Duke to Siler City to address an anti-immigration rally . The notorious ex-Klansman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , the National Organization for European American Rights , jumped at the opportunity to promote white supremacy . A few hundred people showed up to hear Duke denounce the Hispanic newcomers : " To get a few chickens plucked , is it worth losing your heritage ? " Duke asked . Two years later , in July 2002 , a white-supremacist group called National Alliance , based in West Virginia , conducted an anti-immigrant rally in Gainesville , Georgia . " Hispanics in Gainesville have completely taken over , " rally organizer Chester Doles complained , and he went on to say " we will take our borders back . " Another white , anti-immigrant group , Georgians for Immigration Reduction , has lobbied state lawmakers on curbing illegal immigration . One member of the organization expressed his concerns to an Atlanta reporter during a demonstration : " We 're not out here waving the rebel flag . Our only concern about the Georgia flag is that it might be a Mexican flag one day . " Although not widespread , anti-immigrant activities such as those in North Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the way Hispanic newcomers have been changing traditional patterns of small-town southern life. ( n44 ) <p> The new American nativism has not deterred Hispanics from seeking a new and better life in the American South . Like other immigrants to the United States in earlier times , they have found strength in their communal activities and cultural heritage . They have quickly created a vibrant cultural life based on homeland foodways , kinship activities , and musical traditions  --  a cultural life centered not just in the home but in hundreds of restaurants , grocery stores , music and dance clubs , and in traditional holiday festivals . Mexican national holidays and important religious events become occasions to celebrate ethnic culture . Customary religious practice , such as universal veneration of the Mexican national patron saint , the Virgin of Guadalupe , has sustained cultural persistence . Latin groceries and many restaurants supply not only familiar food but Spanish-language newspapers , Latin movie videos , music tapes and CDs , religious icons , home-style clothing ( from white baptism dresses to cowboy boots and hats ) , and check-cashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , and they provide employment to some as cooks , waiters , and food service workers . Latin soccer teams and leagues all over the South provide leisure time activities for young men and Sunday outings for entire families , smoothing the transition to life in America . Some thirty-two soccer teams , for instance , make up the Latin American Soccer League of Birmingham , each team complete with sponsors and colorful uniforms . In 2002 in North Carolina , organizers from twenty-six Hispanic soccer leagues sponsored a state-wide Hispanic soccer championship playoff , the North Carolina Copa Tecate Fiesta Del Futbol . Hispanic bands and dance clubs offer familiar forms of weekend entertainment . Spanish-language newspapers and radio stations have sprouted all over the South , keeping the newcomers informed and sustaining language , culture , and tradition. ( n45 ) <p> The South 's growing Hispanic population has important political implications . For European immigrants of the industrial era , participation in the American political process served as an integrating and Americanizing force  --  a pattern that may eventually emerge among Hispanics in the South . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cutting edge of Latin politicization in the region . Political analysts project 250,000 Hispanic voters in the state in the next decade , so Republican and Democratic party leaders are gearing up for the future . And , as Walter Woods of the Atlanta Business Chronicle suggested in 2002 , " the future is in the numbers . " Indeed , Woods wrote , " Georgia politics in 2015 may look a lot like present day Texas , New York and California , where the Hispanic vote decides elections . " The 2002 election provided a preview of that future , as three Hispanic candidates  --  two Democrats and one Republican  --  were elected to the Georgia legislature from metro Atlanta districts . Equally important , both parties scrambled for votes among Georgia 's Hispanics , who are considered liberal on social issues but conservative on economic matters . Also playing into the political mix , some African American leaders resented efforts to lure Hispanic voters into the Democratic corner , fearing loss of position and power to new ethnic rivals . It is unlikely that these issues will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of Hispanic candidates in Georgia signals the arrival of a new political force in the South  --  one that will only strengthen over time as the citizenship process inevitably produces more Hispanic voters . More immediately , Georgia 's new Hispanic legislators have the opportunity to bring issues of importance to their constituents to the political arena  --  controversial issues such as redistricting , affirmative action , minority contracting , jury service , drivers licenses for illegal immigrants , and tuition and scholarships for undocumented students. ( n46 ) <p> Globalization has brought a transnational , low-wage Hispanic labor force to the land of Dixie  --  a pattern of human migration that has produced substantial cultural and demographic change in a region where change has always been slow and received with skepticism , if not hostility . As the twenty-first century begins , this process of southern ethnic and cultural change has been intensifying . Farms and factories and employers of all kinds now seek out Latino workers for their work ethic and their willingness to work for low pay . After a decade or more of intense immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ways the region is changing , but the speed and strength of these changes in some places , especially in small towns , caught many white and black southerners by surprise . Local print media and television have begun to pay closer attention to the impact of Hispanic migration , as have businessmen and politicians . Several southern states have created offices of Hispanic or Latino affairs . As the Latino newcomers become more numerous , more settled , and more established , they will undoubtedly become more organized , more politically mobilized , and perhaps more amenable to union organization . Many black southerners believe that Hispanics have taken jobs and depressed wages , but there are also signs of interracial activism and alliance among the two groups . Ethnic and linguistic change has also spawned new forms of nativism and stoked concerns about the social and economic costs of immigration . This is the nuevo New South . Ready or not , Dixie appears to be on the cusp of a long-term process of Latinization , mirroring what has already happened in other parts of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
