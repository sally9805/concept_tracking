Thunderous seas , banshee winds , and gnawing pack ice were just the entry fee for a team 's scientific investigations of Antarctic icebergs-one of them a giant of giants . // The Antarctic sun glowed red on the horizon at 1 a.m . A mile and a half from the deck of Braveheart an iceberg the size of six city blocks  --  the iceberg we 'd been tethered to just hours before-heaved upward , one end pausing high in the air like the bow of a foundering ship . When it crashed back down , waves swept through the waters off Cape Hallett . As the boat rocked , the iceberg rose again , and the upper end of it seemed to explode . It was not long before ice shards covered two square miles like shattered crystal . Such an event has rarely been recorded by humans , and it reinforced our sense of the tremendous power , complexity , and danger of the Antarctic icebergs we had come to study . One in particular was cruising the Ross Sea some 125 miles from where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original B-15 , which , when it calved from the Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000 , had an upper surface area of about 4,500 square miles and was estimated to contain enough fresh water to supply the United States for five years . A berg with the dimensions of B-15 comes along once or maybe twice in a lifetime . The National Ice Center in Suitland , Maryland , which has been tracking Antarctic icebergs with satellite mapping techniques for 25 years , has never recorded a berg as big . For nine years satellite images recorded the cracks in the Ross Ice Shelf as they spread and set B-15 loose . It took only a month after B-15 was born for photographer Wes Skiles and me to decide to launch an expedition to study it . Antarctica 's large , tabular bergs create habitat for penguins and seals that climb on ice ledges at the waterline and for seabirds that roost on them . At their edges and in caves that form along them , nutrients mix and fuel the growth of tiny marine plants called phytoplankton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they drift and melt , the bergs leave physical and biological wakes that may encourage the concentration of krill , fish , jellyfish , whales , and seals . In the months after B-15 calved , its fragments appeared headed for the shipping lanes supplying McMurdo Station , where the U.S. Antarctic Program operates year-round . And B-15A , the largest remnant of B-15 , was positioned in a way that impeded more than 170,000 breeding pairs of emperor and Adelie penguins from traveling back and forth to their rookery at Cape Crozier . We recruited an 18-member team of divers , environmental scientists , and a rough-and  --  ready New Zealand crew , and on January 17 , 2001 , in the 129-foot steel-hulled Braveheart , we set sail from Lyttelton , New Zealand . More than 2,000 miles and two weeks later ( the equivalent of traveling from Miami to Los Angeles at seven miles an hour through gale-whipped ocean ) we reached the remote , ice-choked waters of the Ross Sea . In the end an unusually bad season of pack ice kept us from reaching B-15B in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 90 times into the frigid waters , the bergs that littered the Ross Sea-many of them smaller chunks of B-15-provided more than seven weeks of science , exploration , and adventure . We wanted to explore underwater places too dangerous for open-circuit scuba gear , so we used state-of-the-art rebreathing equipment that allows divers to remain safely at greater depths for longer periods by recycling exhaled breath . The water temperature presented separate problems . Seawater at 29.5 deg F sucks away body heat so quickly that a naked person would die in minutes . We wore two layers of underwear , dry suits , electric heaters , and two hoods . Still , most of the time in the water our hands and feet throbbed with pain . It took several months after returning home for some of us to recover complete feeling in faces , fingers , and toes . Although the symptoms of frostbite and neuralgia have faded , the wonder of the expedition has not . Our observations support the research that indicates Antarctica 's monstrous bergs , some of which can last for years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea . As they calve , move , and melt , they play an important role in the operation of the entire global ocean system . That system covers 70 percent of Earth , and what we are learning in Antarctic waters will fundamentally affect what we know about the future of our planet . <p>
