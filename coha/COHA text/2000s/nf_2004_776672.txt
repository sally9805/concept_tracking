Bursting the Limits of Time // Georges Cuvier had a large head-a famously large head-and an ego more than sufficient to swell even it . From his position atop the French scientific establishment during the first third of the nineteenth century , he accumulated high academic posts and official honors like some favored children collect toys : never enough and all kept in play . For his contributions to laying the foundations of modern biology , Cuvier willingly suffered comparisons to Aristotle , the acknowledged founder of the science . As a naturalist , Cuvier fancied himself " the French Newton " - bringing order to the life sciences much as Isaac Newton brought order to the physical sciences . Cuvier 's rigorous empirical methods opened windows into the earth 's biological history that would lead others to a vision of organic evolution he steadfastly refused to see . More than any other naturalist , he so greatly influenced the style and substance of nineteenth-century biology that the history of the modern scientific theory of evolution rightly begins with him-its staunchest foe . // Born in 1769 into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the independent French-German duchy of W ? rttemberg , Cuvier was trained at a regional academy to serve in the duke 's government . Pushed by his mother to excel academically , Cuvier 's formal education included a solid introduction to natural history , a traditional subject encompassing such modern fields as biology , geology , oceanography , mineralogy , and paleontology . This subject became his passion . In 1788 , with no government position open to him at home , Cuvier accepted employment as a private tutor for a French noble family in Normandy . There , as a sideline , he immersed himself in the study of marine invertebrates . From the relative safety of rural Normandy , Cuvier witnessed the French Revolution that began , from his perspective , with high hopes in 1789 but turned terribly ugly during the early 1790s . Becoming a citizen of France in 1793 , when the French government annexed his homeland , Cuvier accepted a post in the revolutionary administration of Normandy even as he turned viscerally against the central regime 's Terror and focused his own attentions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government took power in Paris and promised to rebuild the central scientific establishment decapitated during the Terror , Cuvier moved to the capital in search of a career in science . There were plenty of openings for a naturalist of his obvious brilliance and driving ambition . Cuvier gained an assistantship at the renowned Museum of Natural History , and never looked back . His subsequent rise was meteoric . The study of natural history would never be the same . // Cuvier concentrated his scientific research on the burgeoning field of comparative anatomy ; he was convinced that the internal structure of an animal revealed its function and therefore its true nature . In biology as in all else , form followed function for Cuvier . His research profited greatly from his position at the world 's premier natural-history museum-an institution that rapidly became ever more comprehensive in its zoological holdings as Napoleon 's armies plundered the collections of Europe and sent home live , preserved , and fossilized specimens from as far afield as Russia and Egypt . Ultimately , Cuvier proposed that there are four ( but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embranchements " ) of animals : vertebrates ( with backbones ) , molluscs ( with shells ) , articulates ( such as insects ) , and radiates ( such as starfish ) . " Lesser divisions , " he wrote , " are only modifications superficially founded on development or on the addition of certain parts , but which in no way change the essence of the plan . " 1 This view , built solidly on anatomical analysis and still reflected ( with modifications ) in modern taxonomy , shattered the hierarchical concept dating from Aristotle of a single great chain of beings rising in fine gradations from the simplest living form to humans at the top . The idea within biology of giving an anthropomorphic order to all living things gave way to studying them on their own terms . // Cuvier was the first naturalist to have at his disposal a suitably complete collection of the world 's mammals-past and present-to make definitive distinctions among them . He made the most of this advantage , hoarding it to himself , his collaborators , and his protege ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on his anatomical comparisons of actual specimens , the elephants of India and Africa constituted two distinct species , and that both of them differed from the elephant-like mammoth found only in fossil remains . The positive identification of other living and extinct mammals followed one after another in rapid succession . To account for so many extinct species , as early as 1796 Cuvier announced " the existence of a world previous to ours , destroyed by some kind of catastrophe . " 2 // Before Cuvier , European naturalists typically held that no species-all of them perfect in their original creation-ever died out . Fossils had no fundamental significance : Such things were simply sports of nature or remnants of some still-living species . Overturning this view , Cuvier ultimately concluded that all fossilized animals differed in kind from modern ones and that no modern species existed in truly fossil form . He boldly claimed the power " to burst the limits of time , and , by some observations of fossils , to recover the history of the world , and the succession of events that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Suddenly , life had a history different from the present , and fossil fragments revealed it . " As a new species of antiquarian , " Cuvier explained , " I have had . . . to reconstruct the ancient beings to which these fragments belonged ; to reproduce them in their proportions and characters ; and finally to compare them to those that live today . " 4 The modern science of paleontology was born in Cuvier 's laboratory . Because of his conviction that the form of any animal precisely served its functional needs , Cuvier confidently assumed that trained researchers could , in principle , reconstruct its entire structure from any one of its functional parts . Paleontologists could do for extinct animals what comparative anatomists did for living ones-definitively identify them . Doing so for all of the earth 's past and present species became Cuvier 's goal for science-and he himself would launch the effort , doing his own best work with fishes and four-footed mammals . // A compulsive worker , stern and impatient , Cuvier never doubted his own ability as a science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treacherous shoals of French academic politics just as ably as he mastered comparative anatomy . Even as he climbed the professional ladder within the Museum of Natural History , Cuvier gained leadership posts at the National Institute and the University of France-giving him unparalleled influence over patronage within the country 's highly centralized science establishment . Napoleon named Cuvier to the Council of State in 1813 , and he deftly kept his seat ( and steadily expanded his portfolio ) under three succeeding monarchs . Remarkably , even though every ruler he served was forcibly driven from office at least once , Cuvier held each of his official posts for life and died peacefully in his bed in 1832. // Napoleon ennobled him as a chevalier ; Louis XVIII promoted him to the rank of baron ; under Charles X , he became a grand officer of the Legion of Honor ; Louis-Philippe made him a peer of France . " Cuvier was short and during the Revolution was thin , " one biographer wryly noted . " He became stouter during the Empire ; and he grew enormously fat after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , crowned with a thick mane of hair . According to one observer , Cuvier 's head " gave to his entire person an undeniable cachet of majesty and to his face an expression of profound meditation . " 6 Here was the lion of nineteenth-century French science and founder of modern comparative anatomy and paleontology . Yet his reasoned scientific arguments for the theory of special creation held back the tide of evolutionary thought , which had been rising since the Enlightenment , for a generation . // On the matter of organic evolution ( or " the transmutation of species , " as the concept was then called ) , it was not simply that Cuvier died before the publication of Charles Darwin 's Origin of Species and therefore never seriously considered the idea . He studied it carefully ( albeit not in the light of Darwin 's later arguments for it ) and found it wanting . Although Cuvier 's conclusions on this score reflected his religious and social beliefs , they were founded on his scientific understanding of nature . These added factors-religious and social- // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will be examined first.Living in a particularly volatile era of French religious history characterized by alternating phases of Enlightenment scepticism , Revolutionary atheism , and Restoration Catholicism , Cuvier stood apart from most others within the cultural elite of France by remaining a churchgoing Protestant during his entire life . Indeed , he visibly aligned himself with his religious minority by overseeing government programs for Protestant education and serving as vice president of the Protestant Bible Society of Paris . He married a socially prominent Roman Catholic widow of the Terror , Anne Marie Coquet du Trazail , but they raised their children as Protestants . When his daughter Cl ? mentine adopted an evangelical form of Protestantism , however , she grew to doubt her father 's salvation and prayed for his conversion . That was not about to happen , at least on her terms . By definition , evangelicals publicly proclaim their religious beliefs and seek to convert others . But for Georges Cuvier religion was a strictly private matter . Perhaps it had to be so for him to prosper in French science and politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case . Although he was the very embodiment of reason in science , Cuvier accepted religious truth as existing wholly apart from reason . This made his private religious beliefs virtually invisible to others ; despite considerable speculation , they have remained so to this day . Yet surely he was a Bible-believing Christian of some sort , and biblical Christianity carries with it certain presuppositions about origins . These presuppositions informed Cuvier 's thinking about evolution just as they would for so many other Christians . // The biblical account of creation appears in the book of Genesis , which is sacred scripture for Jews , Christians , and Moslems . For the orthodox , Genesis represents the revealed word of God and , as such , carries special meaning in some literal , allegorical , or mystical sense . Even for liberal theists , led during the nineteenth century by a growing number of German and French theologians whose work Cuvier read , the Genesis account carries meaning as an early record of the Jewish people 's understanding of God 's role in Creation . Indeed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genesis gains authority as one of the earliest written records of creation . Accorded any of these meanings , the Genesis account becomes foundational for one 's understanding of nature . // The first chapter of Genesis tells of God creating the heavens and the earth , then plants and animals , and finally humans-everything in six days . All types of plants and animals are said to reproduce " according to their kind . " Read literally , this precludes evolution from one " kind " of plant or animal to another . Regarding humans , the account declares that God separately created them in His own image and likeness . The second chapter of Genesis contains an alternative creation account in which the order of the appearance of life forms on earth is somewhat reversed-but with a similar emphasis on the special creation of humans by God . Indeed , it is this second account that first introduces Adam and Eve as the progenitors of the human race , with God directly forming them as man and woman . The Bible does not state when these creation events occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the past six thousand years . During the mid-1600s , Anglican archbishop James Ussher of Dublin used internal evidence within the Bible to calculate the year of creation as 4004 b.c. , or less than three thousand years before Genesis was supposedly written by the Hebrew leader Moses . Printed in the margins of the Authorized , or King James , version of the Bible , Ussher 's chronology became quasi gospel for British and American Protestants during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . // Generally speaking , Christian leaders from the early church through the Reformation did not view the Bible as a scientific text . They interpreted it as a divinely authored or inspired volume of separately written books and letters filled with spiritual meanings , some of them allegorical . Science , in the sense of a distinct intellectual tradition seeking rational explanations for physical phenomena , began with ancient Greek natural philosophy roughly five hundred years before Christ . Although most individual Greeks probably accepted religious or mythical explanations for natural phenomena , some Greek philosophers sought to separate the supernatural from the natural by proposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical matter in meaningless motion , the ancient Greek atomists proclaimed . The origin of life and individual species posed a particular problem for Greeks intent on devising purely materialistic explanations for natural phenomena . Creation implies a creator , and so to dispense with the need for a biological creator , such ancient philosophers as Anaximander , Empedocles , the atomists , and the Epicureans advanced various crude notions of organic evolution . // Based on his close study of animal anatomy , however , Aristotle concluded that species are absolutely immutable . Each species always breeds true to its form , he maintained , and never gives birth to a new type . Rejecting both creation and evolution , Aristotle ( an atheist ) simply posited that species are eternal . Integrating the Genesis account with mainstream Aristotelean science , premodern Christian naturalists viewed species as created by God in the beginning and thereafter fixed for all time in a perfect ( albeit fallen ) creation . Well into the nineteenth century even Cuvier saw no scientific reason to reject Aristotelean thinking on the fixity of species-and fully appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or allegorically , the Genesis account harmonizes with the idea that species , once created , never change . // By 1800 , Cuvier also had compelling social reasons for maintaining the traditional Aristotelean view of species . //
