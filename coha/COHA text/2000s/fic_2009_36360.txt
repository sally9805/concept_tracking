I 've always wondered what people felt in the final few hours of their lives . Did they know something terrible was about to occur ? Sense imminent tragedy , hold their loved ones close ? Or is it one of those things that simply happens ? The mother of four , tucking her kids into bed , worrying about the morning car pool , the laundry she still has n't done , and the funny noise the furnace is making again , only to catch an eerie creak coming from down the hall . Or the teenage girl , dreaming about her Saturday shopping date with her BFF , only to open her eyes and discover she 's no longer alone in her room . Or the father , bolting awake , thinking , What the fuck ? right before the hammer catches him between the eyes . <br> In the last six hours of the world as I know it , I feed Ree dinner . Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese , topped with pieces of turkey dog . I slice up an apple . She eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red peel . I tell her the skin holds all the nutrients . She rolls her eyes  --  four going on fourteen . We already fight over clothing  --  she likes short skirts , her father and I prefer long dresses , she wants a bikini , we insist she wear a one-piece . I figure it 's only a matter of weeks before she demands the keys to the car . <br> Afterward Ree wants to go " treasure hunting " in the attic . I tell her it 's bath time . Shower , actually . We share the old claw-foot tub in the upstairs bath , as we 've been doing since she was a baby . Ree lathers up two Barbies and one princess rubber duckie . I lather up her . By the time we 're done , we both smell like lavender and the entire black-and-white checkered bathroom is smothered with steam . <br> I like the post-shower ritual . We wrap up in giant towels , then make a beeline down the chilly hallway to the Big Bed in Jason 's and my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms cocooned , but toes sticking out , lightly touching . Our orange tabby cat , Mr. Smith , jumps on the bed , and peers down at us with his big golden eyes , long tail twitching . <br> " What was your favorite part of today ? " I ask my daughter . <br> Ree crinkles her nose . " I do n't remember . " <br> Mr. Smith moves away from us , finding a nice comfy spot by the headboard , and begins to groom . He knows what 's coming next . <br> " My favorite part was coming home from school and getting a big hug . " I 'm a teacher . It 's Wednesday . Wednesday I get home around four , Jason departs at five . Ree is used to the drill by now . Daddy is daytime , Mommy is nighttime . We did n't want strangers raising our child and we 've gotten our wish . <br> " Can I watch a movie ? " Ree asks . Is always asking . She 'd live with the DVD player if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I answer lightly . " Tell me about school . " <br> " A short movie , " she counters . Then offers , triumphantly , " Veggie Tales ! " <br> " No movie , " I repeat , untucking an arm long enough to tickle her under the chin . It 's nearly eight o'clock and I know she 's tired and willful . I 'd like to avoid a full tantrum this close to bedtime . " Now tell me about school . What 'd you have for snack ? " <br> She frees her own arms and tickles me under my chin . " Carrots ! " <br> " Oh yeah ? " More tickling , behind her ear . " Who brought them ? " <br> " Heidi ! " <br> She 's trying for my armpits . I deftly block the move . " Art or music ? " <br> " Music ! " <br> " Singing or instrument ? " <br> " Guitar ! " <br> She 's got the towel off and pounces on me , tickling anyplace she can find with fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end-of-the-day collapse . I manage to fend her off , rolling laughing off the edge of the bed . I land with a thump on the hardwood floor , which makes her giggle harder and Mr. Smith yowl in protest . He scampers out of the room , impatient now for the completion of our evening ritual . <br> I find a long T-shirt for me , and an Ariel nightgown for her . We brush our teeth together , side by side in front of the oval mirror . Ree likes the synchronized spit . Two stories , one song , and half a Broadway show later , I finally have her tucked into bed with Lil ' Bunny clutched in her hands and Mr. Smith curled up next to her feet . <br> Eight-thirty . Our little house is officially my own . I take up roost at the kitchen counter . Sip tea , grade papers , keep my back to the computer so I wo n't be tempted . The cat clock Jason got Ree one Christmas meows on the hour . The sound echoes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it really is . <br> My feet are cold . It 's March in New England , the days still chilly . I should put on socks but I do n't feel like getting up . <br> Nine-fifteen , I make my rounds . Bolt lock on the back door , check the wooden posts jammed into each window frame . Finally , the double bolt on the steel front door . We live in South Boston , in a modest , middle-class neighborhood with tree-lined streets and family-friendly parks . Lots of kids , lots of white picket fences . <br> I check the locks and reinforce the windows anyway . Both Jason and I have our reasons . <br> Then I 'm standing at the computer again , hands itching by my side . Telling myself it 's time to go to bed . Warning myself not to take a seat . Thinking I 'm probably going to do it anyway . Just for a minute . Check a few e-mails . What can it hurt ? <br> At the last moment , I find willpower I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead . Another family policy : The computer must be turned off before going to bed . <br> A computer is a portal , you know , an entry point into your home . Or maybe you do n't know . <br> Soon enough , you 'll understand . <br> Ten o'clock , I leave the kitchen light on for Jason . He has n't called , so apparently it 's a busy night . That 's okay , I tell myself . Busy is busy . It seems we go longer in silence all the time . These things happen . Especially when you have a small child . <br> I think of February vacation again . The family getaway that was either the best or the worst thing that happened to us , given your point of view . I want to understand it . Make some sense of my husband , of myself . There are things that once done ca n't be undone , things that once said ca n't be unsaid . <br> I ca n't fix any of it tonight . In fact , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , which has been starting to fill me with more and more dread . Once , I honestly believed love alone could heal all wounds . Now I know better . <br> At the top of the stairs , I pause outside Ree 's door for my final good-night check . I carefully crack open the door and peer in . Mr. Smith 's golden eyes gaze back at me . He does n't get up , and I ca n't blame him : It 's a cozy scene , Ree curled in a ball under the pink-and-green flowered covers , sucking her thumb , a tousle of dark curls peeking up from above the sheets . She looks small again , like the baby I swear I had only yesterday , yet somehow it 's four years later and she dresses herself and feeds herself and keeps us informed of all the opinions she has on life . <br> I think I love her . <br> I think love is not an adequate word to express the emotion I feel in my chest . <br> I close the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipping beneath the blue-and-green wedding quilt . <br> The door is cracked for Ree . The hallway light on for Jason . <br> The evening ritual is complete . All is as it should be . <br> I lie on my side , pillow between my knees , hand splayed on my hip . I am staring at everything and nothing at all . I am thinking that I am tired , and that I 've screwed up and that I wish Jason was home and yet I am grateful that he is gone , and that I 've got to figure out something except I have no idea what . <br> I love my child . I love my husband . <br> I am an idiot . <br> And I remember something , something I have not thought about for months now . The fragment is not so much a memory as it is a scent : rose petals , crushed , decaying , simmering outside my bedroom window in the Georgia heat . While Mama 's voice floats down the darkened hall , " I know something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shhh , shhh , shhh , " I whisper now . My hand curves around my stomach and I think too much of things I have spent most of my life trying to forget . <br> " Shhh , shhh , shhh , " I try again . <br> And then , a sound from the base of the stairs . . . <br> In the last moments of the world as I know it , I wish I could tell you I heard an owl hoot out in the darkness . Or saw a black cat leap over the fence . Or felt the hairs tingle on the nape of my neck . <br> I wish I could tell you I saw the danger , that I put up one helluva fight . After all , I , of all people , should understand just how easily love can turn to hate , desire to obsession . I , of all people , should have seen it coming . <br> But I did n't . I honestly did n't . <br> And God help me , when his face materialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that he was just as handsome now as when we first met , and that I still wished I could trace the line of his jaw , run my fingers through the waves of his hair . . . . <br> Then I thought , looking at what was down at his side , that I must n't scream . I must protect my daughter , my precious daughter still sleeping down the hall . <br> He stepped into the room . Raised both of his arms . <br> I swear to you I did n't make a sound . <br> Continues ...
