SEPTEMBER 2003 <p> Alice sat at her desk in their bedroom distracted by the sounds of John racing through each of the rooms on the first floor . She needed to finish her peer review of a paper submitted to the Journal of Cognitive Psychology before her flight , and she 'd just read the same sentence three times without comprehending it . It was 7:30 according to their alarm clock , which she guessed was about ten minutes fast . She knew from the approximate time and the escalating volume of his racing that he was trying to leave , but he 'd forgotten something and could n't find it . She tapped her red pen on her bottom lip as she watched the digital numbers on the clock and listened for what she knew was coming . <p> " Ali ? " <p> She tossed her pen onto the desk and sighed . Downstairs , she found him in the living room on his knees , feeling under the couch cushions . <p> " Keys ? " she asked . <p> " Glasses . Please do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She followed his frantic glance to the fireplace mantle where the antique Waltham clock , valued for its precision , declared 8:00 . He should have known better than to trust it . The clocks in their home rarely knew the real time of day . Alice had been duped too often in the past by their seemingly honest faces and had learned long ago to rely on her watch . Sure enough , she lapsed back in time as she entered the kitchen , where the microwave insisted that it was only 6:52 . <p> She looked across the smooth , uncluttered surface of the granite countertop , and there they were , next to the mushroom bowl heaping with unopened mail . Not under something , not behind something , not obstructed in any way from plain view . How could he , someone so smart , a scientist , not see what was right in front of him ? <p> Of course , many of her own things had taken to hiding in mischievous , little places as well . But she did n't admit this to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just the other day , John blissfully unaware , she 'd spent a crazed morning looking first all over the house and then in her office for her Blackberry charger . Stumped , she 'd surrendered , gone to the store , and bought a new one , only to discover it later that night plugged in the socket next to her side of the bed , where she should have known to look . She could probably chalk it all up for both of them to excessive multitasking and being way too busy . And to getting older . <p> He stood in the doorway , looking at the glasses in her hand , but not at her . <p> " Next time , try pretending you 're a woman while you look , " said Alice , smiling . <p> " I 'll wear one of your skirts . Ali , please , I 'm really late . " <p> " The microwave says you have tons of time , " she said , handing them to him . <p> " Thanks . " <p> He grabbed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and headed for the front door . <p> " Will you be home when I get back on Saturday ? " she asked his back as she followed him down the hallway . <p> " I do n't know , I 've got a huge day in lab on Saturday . " <p> He collected his briefcase , phone , and keys from the hall table . <p> " Have a good trip , give Lydia a hug and kiss for me . And try not to battle with her , " said John . <p> She caught their reflection in the hallway mirror  --  -a distinguished-looking , tall man with white-flecked brown hair and glasses , a petite , curly-haired woman , her arms crossed over her chest , each readying to leap into that same , bottomless argument . She gritted her teeth and swallowed , choosing not to jump . <p> " We have n't seen each other in a while , please try to be home ? " she asked . <p> " I know , I 'll try . " <p> He kissed her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an almost imperceptible moment . If she did n't know him better , she might 've romanticized his kiss . She might 've stood there , hopeful , thinking it said , I love you , I 'll miss you . But as she watched him hustle down the street alone , she felt pretty certain he 'd just told her , I love you , but please do n't be pissed when I 'm not home on Saturday . <p> They used to walk together over to Harvard Yard every morning . Of the many things she loved about working within a mile from home and at the same school , their shared commute was the thing she loved most . They always stopped at Jerri's -- a black coffee for him , a tea with lemon for her , iced or hot , depending on the season -- and continued on to Harvard Square , chatting about their research and classes , issues in their respective departments , their children , or plans for that evening . When they were first married , they even held hands . She savored the relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily demands of their jobs and ambitions rendered them each stressed and exhausted . <p> But for some time now , they 'd been walking over to Harvard separately . Alice had been living out of her suitcase all summer , attending psychology conferences in Rome , New Orleans , and Miami , and serving on an exam committee for a thesis defense at Princeton . Back in the spring , John 's cell cultures had needed some sort of rinsing attention at an obscene hour each morning , but he did n't trust any of his students to consistently show up . So he did . She could n't remember the reasons that predated spring , but she knew that each time they 'd seemed reasonable and only temporary . <p> She returned to the paper at her desk , still distracted , now by a craving for that fight she did n't have with John about their youngest daughter , Lydia . Would it kill him to stand behind her for once ? She gave the rest of the paper a cursory effort , not her typical standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fragmented state of mind and lack of time . Her comments and suggestions for revision finished , she packaged and sealed the envelope , guiltily aware that she might 've missed an error in the study 's design or interpretation , cursing John for compromising the integrity of her work . <p> She repacked her suitcase , not even emptied yet from her last trip . She looked forward to traveling less in the coming months . There were only a handful of invited lectures penciled in her fall semester calendar , and she scheduled most of those on Fridays , a day she did n't teach . Like tomorrow . Tomorrow she would be the guest speaker to kick off Stanford 's cognitive psychology fall colloquium series . And afterward , she 'd see Lydia . She 'd try not to battle with her , but she was n't making any promises . <p> Alice found her way easily to Stanford 's Cordura Hall on the corner of Campus Drive West and Panama Drive . Its concrete , white stucco exterior , terra cotta roof , and lush landscaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach resort than an academic building . She arrived quite early but ventured inside anyway , figuring she could use the extra time to sit in the quiet auditorium and look over her talk . <p> Much to her surprise , she walked into an already packed room . A zealous crowd surrounded and circled a buffet table , aggressively diving in for food like seagulls at a city beach . Before she could sneak in unnoticed , she noticed Josh , a former Harvard classmate and respected egomaniac , standing in her path , his legs planted firmly and a little too wide , like he was ready to dive at her . <p> " All this , for me ? " asked Alice , smiling playfully . <p> " What , we eat like this every day . It 's for one of our developmental psychologists , he was tenured yesterday . So how 's Harvard treating you ? " <p> " Good . " <p> " I ca n't believe you 're still there after all these years . You ever get too bored over there , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you know . How are things with you ? " <p> " Fantastic . You should come by my office after the talk , see our latest modeling data . It 'll really knock your socks off . " <p> " Sorry , I ca n't , I have to catch a flight to LA right after this , " she said , grateful to have a ready excuse . <p> " Oh , too bad . Last time I saw you I think was last year at the Psychonomic Conference . I unfortunately missed your presentation . " <p> " Well , you 'll get to hear a good portion of it today . " <p> " Recycling your talks these days , huh ? " <p> Before she could answer , Gordon Miller , head of the department and her new superhero , swooped in and saved her by asking Josh to help pass out the champagne . Like at Harvard , a champagne toast was a tradition in the psychology department at Stanford for all faculty who reached the coveted career milestone of tenure . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in the career of a professor , but tenure was a big one , loud and clear . <p> When everyone was holding a cup , Gordon stood at the podium and tapped the microphone . <p> " Can I have everyone 's attention for a moment ? " <p> Josh 's excessively loud , punctated laugh reverberated alone throughout the auditorium just before Gordon continued . <p> " Today , we congratulate Mark on receiving tenure . I 'm sure he 's thrilled to have this particular accomplishment behind him . Here 's to the many exciting accomplishments still ahead . To Mark ! " <p> " To Mark ! " <p> Alice tapped her cup with her neighbors , and everyone quickly resumed the business of drinking , eating , and discussing . When all of the food had been claimed from the serving trays and the last drops of champagne emptied from the last bottle , Gordon took the floor once again . <p> " If everyone would take a seat , we can begin today 's talk . " <p> He waited a few moments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Today , I have the honor of introducing you to our first colloquium speaker of the year . Dr. Alice Howland is the eminent William James Professor of Psychology at Harvard University . Over the last twenty-five years , her distinguished career has produced many of the flagship touchstones in psycholinguistics . She pioneered and continues to lead an interdisciplinary and integrated approach to the study of the mechanisms of language . We are privileged to have her here today to talk to us about the Conceptual and Neural Organization of Language . " <p> Alice switched places with Gordon and looked out at her audience looking at her . As she waited for the applause to subside , she thought of the statistic that said that people feared public speaking more than they feared death . She loved it . She enjoyed all of the concatenated moments of presenting in front of a listening audience -- -teaching , performing , telling a story , teeing up a heated debate . She also loved the adrenaline rush . The bigger the stakes , the more sophisticated or hostile the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an excellent speaker , but it often pained and terrified him , and he marveled at Alice 's verve for it . He probably did n't prefer death , but spiders and snakes , sure . <p> " Thank you , Gordon . Today , I 'm going to talk about some of the mental processes that underlie the acquisition , organization , and use of language . " <p> Alice had given the guts of this particular talk innumerable times , but she would n't call it recycling . The crux of the talk did focus on the main tenets of linguistics , many of which she 'd discovered , and she 'd been using a number of the same slides for years . But she felt proud , and not ashamed or lazy , that this part of her talk , these discoveries of hers , continued to hold true , withstanding the test of time . Her contributions mattered and propelled future discovery . Plus , she certainly included those future discoveries . <p> She talked without needing to look down at her notes , relaxed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes into the fifty-minute presentation , she became suddenly stuck . <p> " The data reveal that irregular verbs require access to the mental ... " <p> She simply could n't find the word . She had a loose sense for what she wanted to say , but the word itself eluded her . Gone . She did n't know the first letter or what the word sounded like or how many syllables it had . It was n't on the tip of her tongue . <p> Maybe it was the champagne . She normally did n't drink any alcohol before speaking . Even if she knew the talk cold , even in the most casual setting , she always wanted to be as mentally sharp as possible , especially for the question and answer session at the end , which could be confrontational and full of rich , unscripted debate . But she did n't wanted to offend anyone , and she drank a little more than she probably should have when she became trapped again in passive aggressive conversation with Josh . <p> Maybe it was jet lag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rational reason as to why she lost it , her heart pounded and her face grew hot . She 'd never lost a word in front of an audience before . But she 'd also never panicked in front of an audience either , and she 'd stood before many far larger and more intimidating than this . She told herself to breath , forget about it , and move on . <p> She replaced the still blocked word with a vague and inappropriate ' thing , ' abandoned whatever point she 'd been in the middle of making , and continued on to the next slide . The pause had seemed like an obvious and awkward eternity to her , but as she checked the faces in the audience to see if anyone had noticed her mental hiccup , no one appeared alarmed , embarrassed , or ruffled in any way . Then , she saw Josh whispering to the woman next to him , his eyebrows furrowed and a slight smile on his face . <p> She was on the plane , descending into LAX , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been living in Los Angeles for three years now . If she 'd gone to college right after high school , she would 've graduated this past spring . Alice would 've been so proud . Lydia was probably smarter than both of her older siblings , and they had gone to college . And law school . And medical school . <p> Instead of college , Lydia first went to Europe . Alice had hoped she 'd come home with a clearer sense of what she wanted to study and what kind of school she wanted to go to . Instead , upon her return , she told her parents that she 'd done a little acting while in Dublin and had fallen in love . She was moving to Los Angeles immediately . <p> Alice nearly lost her mind . Much to her own maddening frustration , she recognized her own contribution to this problem . Because Lydia was the youngest of three , the daughter of parents who worked a lot and traveled regularly , and had always been a good student , Alice and John ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of room to run in her world , free to think for herself and from the kind of micromanagement placed on a lot of children her age . Her parents ' professional lives served as shining examples of what could be gained from setting lofty and individually unique goals and pursuing them with passion and hard work . Lydia understood her mother 's advice about the importance of getting a college education , but she had the confidence and audacity to reject it . <p> Plus , she did n't stand entirely alone . The most explosive fight Alice ever had with John followed his two cents on the subject --  I think it 's wonderful , she can always go to college later , if she decides she even wants to . <p> Alice checked her Blackberry for the address , rang the doorbell to apartment number seven , and waited . She was just about to press it again when Lydia opened the door . <p> " Mom , you 're early , " said Lydia . <p> Alice checked her watch . <p> " I 'm right on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in at eight . " <p> " I said five . " <p> " I have eight o'clock written down in my book . " <p> " Lydia , it 's 5:45 , I 'm here . " <p> Lydia looked indecisive and panicky , like a squirrel caught facing an oncoming car in the road . <p> " Sorry , come in . " <p> They each hesitated before they hugged , as if they were about to practice a newly learned dance and were n't quite confident of the first step or who should lead . Or it was an old dance , but they had n't performed it together in so long that they each felt unsure of the choreography . <p> Alice could feel the contours of Lydia 's spine and ribs through her shirt . She looked too skinny , a good ten pounds lighter than Alice remembered . She hoped it was more a result of being busy than of conscious dieting . Blonde and five feet six , three inches taller than Alice , Lydia stood out among the predominance of short Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the waiting rooms at every audition were apparently full of women who looked just like her . <p> " I made reservations for nine . Wait here , I 'll be right back . " <p> Craning her neck , Alice inspected the kitchen and living room from the hallway . The furnishings , most likely yard sale finds and parent hand-me-downs , looked rather hip together -- -an orange sectional couch , retro-inspired coffee table , Brady Bunch style kitchen table and chairs . The white walls were bare except for a poster of Marlon Brando taped above the couch . The air smelled strongly of Windex , as if Lydia had probably taken last second measures to clean the place before Alice 's arrival . <p> In fact , it was a little too clean . No DVD 's or CD 's laying around , no books or magazines thrown on the coffee table , no pictures on the refrigerator , no hint of Lydia 's interests or aesthetic anywhere . Anyone could be living here . Then , she noticed the pile of men 's shoes on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me about your roommates , " said Alice , as Lydia returned from her room , cell phone in hand . <p> " They 're at work . " <p> " What kind of work ? " <p> " One 's bartending and the other delivers food . " <p> " I thought they were both actors . " <p> " They are . " <p> " I see . What are their names again ? " <p> " Doug and Malcolm . " <p> It flashed only for a moment , but Alice saw it and Lydia saw her see it . Lydia 's face flushed when she said Malcolm 's name , and her eyes darted nervously away from her mother 's . <p> " Why do n't we get going ? They said they can take us early , " said Lydia . <p> " Okay , I just need to use the bathroom first . " <p> As Alice washed her hands , she looked over the products sitting on the table next to the sink -- Neutrogena facial cleanser and moisturizer , Tom 's of Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playtex tampons . She thought for a moment . She had n't had her period all summer . Did she have it in May ? She 'd be turning fifty next month , so she was n't alarmed . She had n't yet experienced any hot flashes or night sweats , but not all menopausal women did . That would be just fine with her . <p> As she dried her hands , she noticed the box of Trojan condoms behind Lydia 's hair styling products . She was going to have to find out more about these roommates . Malcolm , in particular . <p> They sat at a table outside on the patio at Ivy , a trendy restaurant in downtown Los Angeles , and ordered two drinks , an espresso martini for Lydia and a merlot for Alice . <p> " So how 's Dad 's Science paper coming ? " asked Lydia . <p> She must 've talked recently with her father . Alice had n't heard from her since a phone call on Mother 's Day . <p> " It 's done . He 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tom ? " <p> " Good , busy , working hard . So how did you meet Doug and Malcolm ? " <p> " They came into Starbucks one night while I was working . " <p> The waiter appeared , and they each ordered dinner and another drink . Alice hoped the alcohol would dilute the tension between them , which felt heavy and thick and just beneath the tracing-paper-thin conversation . <p> " So how did you meet Doug and Malcolm ? " asked Alice . <p> " I just told you . Why do n't you ever listen to anything I say ? They came into Starbucks one night talking about looking for a roommate while I was working . " <p> " I thought you were waitressing at a restaurant . " <p> " I am . I work at Starbucks during the week and waitress on Saturday nights . " <p> " Does n't sound like that leaves a lot of time for acting . " <p> " I 'm not cast in anything right now , but I 'm taking workshop classes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of classes ? " <p> " Meisner technique . " <p> " And what 've you been auditioning for ? " <p> " Television and print . " <p> Alice swirled her wine , drank the last , big gulp , and licked her lips . <p> " Lydia , what exactly is your plan here ? " <p> " I 'm not planning on stopping , if that 's what you 're asking . " <p> The drinks were taking effect , but not in the direction Alice had hoped for . Instead , they served as the fuel that burned that little piece of tracing paper , leaving the tension between them fully exposed and at the helm of a dangerously familiar conversation . <p> " You ca n't live like this forever . Are you still going to work at Starbucks when you 're thirty ? " <p> " That 's eight years away ! Do you know what you 'll be doing in eight years ? " <p> " Yes , I do . At some point , you need to be responsible , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage , savings for retirement --  " <p> " I have health insurance . And I might make it as an actor . There are people who do , you know . And they make a hell of a lot more money than you and Dad combined . " <p> " This is n't just about money . " <p> " Then what ? That I did n't become you ? " <p> " Lower your voice . " <p> " Do n't tell me what to do . " <p> " I do n't want you to become me , Lydia . I just do n't want you to limit your choices . " <p> " You want to make my choices . " <p> " No . " <p> " This is who I am , this is what I want to do . " <p> " What , serving up venti lattes ? You should be in college . You should be spending this time in your life learning something . " <p> " I am learning something ! I 'm just not sitting in a Harvard classroom killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm in a serious acting class for fifteen hours a week . How many hours of class a week do your students take , twelve ? " <p> " It 's not the same thing . " <p> " Well , Dad thinks it is . He 's paying for it . " <p> Alice clenched the sides of her skirt and pressed her lips together . What she wanted to say next was n't meant for Lydia . <p> " You 've never even seen me act . " <p> John had . He flew out alone last winter to see her perform in a play . Swamped with too many urgent things at the time , Alice could n't free up to go . As she looked at Lydia 's pained eyes , she could n't remember now what those urgent things had been . She did n't have anything against an acting career itself , but she believed Lydia 's singular pursuit of it , without an education , bordered reckless . If she did n't go to college now , acquire a knowledge base or formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree , what would she do if acting did n't pan out ? <p> She thought about those condoms in the bathroom . What if Lydia got pregnant ? Alice worried that Lydia might find herself someday trapped in a life that was unfulfilled , full of regret . She looked at her daughter and saw so much wasted potential , so much wasted time . <p> " You 're not getting any younger , Lydia . Life goes by too fast . " <p> " I agree . " <p> The food came , but neither of them picked up a fork . Lydia dabbed her eyes with her hand-embroidered linen napkin . They always fell into the same battle , and it felt to Alice like trying to knock down a concrete wall with their heads . It was never going to be productive and only resulted in hurting them , causing lasting damage . She wished Lydia could see the love and wisdom in what she wanted for her . She wished she could just reach across the table and hug her , but there were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> A sudden flurry of activity a few tables away pulled their attention away from themselves . Several camera flashes popped and a small crowd of patrons and wait staff gathered , all focused on a woman who looked a bit like Lydia . <p> " Who 's that ? " asked Alice . <p> " Mom , " said Lydia in a tone both embarrassed and superior , perfected at the age of thirteen . " That 's Jennifer Aniston . " <p> They ate their dinner and talked only of safe things , like the food and the weather . Alice wanted to discover more about Lydia 's relationship with Malcolm , but the embers of Lydia 's emotions still glowed hot , and Alice feared igniting another fight . She paid the bill , and they left the restaurant , full but dissatisfied . <p> " Excuse me , ma'am ! " <p> Their waiter caught up to them on the sidewalk . <p> " You left this . " <p> Alice paused , trying to comprehend how their waiter might come to possess her Blackberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt inside her bag . No Blackberry . She must 've removed it when she fished her wallet out to pay . <p> " Thank you . " <p> Lydia looked at her quizzically , as if she wanted to say something about something other than food or weather , but then did n't . They walked back to her apartment in silence . <p> " John ? " <p> Alice waited , suspended in the front hallway , holding the handle of her suitcase . Harvard Magazine lay on the top of a pile of unclaimed mail strewn on the floor in front of her . The clock in the living room ticked and the refrigerator hummed . A warm , sunny late afternoon at her back , the air inside felt chilly , dim , and stale . Uninhabited . <p> She picked up the mail and walked into the kitchen , her suitcase on wheels accompanying her like a loyal pet . Her flight had been delayed , and she was late getting in , even according to the microwave . He 'd had a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The red voicemail light on their answering machine stared her down , unblinking . She checked the refrigerator . No note on the door . Nothing . <p> Still clutching the handle of her suitcase , she stood in the dark kitchen and watched several minutes advance on the microwave . The disappointed but forgiving voice in her head faded to a whisper as the volume of a more primal one began to build and spread out . She thought about calling him , but the expanding voice rejected the suggestion outright and refused all excuses . She thought about deciding not to care , but the voice , now seeping down into her body , echoing in her belly , vibrating in each of her fingertips , was too powerful and pervasive to ignore . <p> Why did it bother her so much ? He was in the middle of an experiment and could n't leave it to come home . She 'd certainly been in his shoes innumerable times . This was what they did . This was who they were . The voice called her a stupid fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the back door . A run would make her feel better . That was what she needed . <p> Ideally , she ran every day . For many years now , she treated running like eating or sleeping , as a vital daily necessity , and she 'd been known to squeeze in a jog at midnight or in the middle of a blinding snowstorm . But she 'd neglected this basic need over the last several months . She 'd been so busy . As she laced her shoes , she told herself she had n't bothered bringing them with her to California because she 'd known she would n't have the time . In truth , she 'd simply forgotten to pack them . <p> When starting from her house on Poplar Street , she invariably followed the same route -- down Massachusetts Avenue , through Harvard Square to Memorial Drive , along the Charles River to the Harvard Bridge over by MIT , and back -- a little over five miles , a forty-five minute round trip . She had long been attracted to the idea of running in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the time to train for that kind of distance . Maybe some day she would . In excellent physical condition for a woman her age , she imagined running strong well into her sixties . <p> Clustered pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks and intermittent negotiations with car traffic in street intersections littered the first part of her run down Massachusetts Avenue and through Harvard Square . It was crowded and ripe with anticipation at that time of day on a Saturday , with crowds forming and milling around on street corners waiting for walk signals , outside restaurants waiting for tables , in movie theater lines waiting for tickets , and in double-parked cars , waiting for an unlikely opening in a metered space . The first ten minutes of her run required a good deal of conscious external concentration to navigate through it all , but once she crossed Memorial Drive to the Charles River , she was free to run in full stride and completely in the zone . <p> A comfortable and cloudless evening invited a lot of activity along the Charles , yet it felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady stream of joggers , dogs and their owners , walkers , rollerbladers , cyclists , and women pushing babies in jogger strollers , like an experienced driver on a regularly traveled stretch of road , Alice only retained a vague sense for what went on around her now . As she ran along the river , she became mindful of nothing but the sounds of her Nikes hitting the pavement in syncopated rhythm with the pace of her breath . She did n't replay her argument with Lydia . She did n't acknowledge her growling stomach . She did n't think about John . She just ran . <p> As was her routine , she stopped running once she made it back to the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Park , a pocket of manicured lawns abutting Memorial Drive . Her head cleared , her body relaxed and rejuvenated , she began walking home . The JFK Park funneled into Harvard Square through a pleasant , bench-lined corridor between the Charles Hotel and the Kennedy School of Government . <p> Through the corridor , she stood at the intersection of Eliot Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed her forearm with startling force and said , " Have you thought about heaven today ? " <p> The woman fixed Alice with a penetrating , unwavering stare . She had long hair the color and texture of a teased Brillo pad and wore a hand-made placard hung over her chest that read AMERICA REPENT , TURN TO JESUS FROM SIN . There was always someone selling God in Harvard Square , but Alice had never been singled out so directly and intimately before . <p> " Sorry , " said Alice , and , noticing a break in the flow of traffic , she escaped to the other side of the street . <p> She wanted to continue walking but stood frozen instead . She did n't know where she was . She looked back across the street . The Brillo-haired woman pursued another sinner down the corridor . The corridor , the hotel , the stores , the illogically meandering streets . She knew she was in Harvard Square , but she did n't know which way was home . <p> She tried again , more specifically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardware , Mount Auburn Street . She knew all of these places -- this square had been her stomping ground for over twenty-five years -- but they somehow did n't fit into a mental map that told her where she lived relative to them . A black and white circular " T " sign directly in front of her marked an entrance to the Red Line trains and buses underground , but there were four such entrances in Harvard Square , and she could n't piece together which one of the four this one was . <p> Her heart began to race . She started sweating . She told herself that an accelerated heart rate and perspiration were part of an orchestrated and appropriate response to running . But standing still on the sidewalk , it felt like panic . <p> She willed herself to walk another block and then another , her rubbery legs feeling like they might give way with each bewildered step . The Coop , Cardullo 's , the magazines on the corner , the Cambridge Visitor Center across the street , and Harvard Yard beyond that . She told herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped . It all lacked a context . <p> People , cars , buses , and all kinds of unbearable noise rushed and wove around and past her . She closed her eyes . She listened to her own blood whoosh and pulse behind her ears . <p> " Please stop this , " she whispered . <p> She opened her eyes . Just as suddenly as it had left her , the landscape snapped snugly back into place . The Coop , Cardullo 's , Nini 's Corner , Harvard Yard . She automatically understood that she should turn left at the corner and head west on Mass Ave . She began to breathe easier , no longer bizarrely lost within a mile of home . But she 'd just been bizarrely lost within a mile of home . She walked as fast as she could without running . <p> She turned onto her street , a quiet , tree-lined , residential road a couple of blocks removed from Mass Ave . With both feet on her road and her house in sight , she felt much safer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door and her legs moving and promised herself that the sea of anxiety swelling furiously inside her would drain when she walked in the front hallway and saw John . If he was home . <p> " John ? " <p> He appeared in the threshold of the kitchen , unshaven , his glasses sitting on top of his mad scientist hair , sucking on a red popsicle and sporting his lucky gray T-shirt . He 'd been up all night . As she 'd promised herself , her anxiety began to drain . But her energy and bravery seemed to leak out with it , leaving her fragile and wanting to collapse into his arms . <p> " Hey , I was wondering where you were , just about to leave you a note on the fridge . How 'd it go ? " he asked . <p> " What ? " <p> " Stanford . " <p> " Oh , good . " <p> " And how 's Lydia ? " <p> The betrayal and hurt over Lydia , over him not being home when she got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over being inexplicably lost , reclaimed its priority in the pecking order . <p> " You tell me , " she said . <p> " You guys fought . " <p> " You 're paying for her acting classes ? " she accused . <p> " Oh , " he said , sucking the last of the popsicle into his red stained mouth . " Look , can we talk about this later ? I do n't have time to get into it right now . " <p> " Make the time , John . You 're keeping her afloat out there without telling me , and you 're not here when I get home , and -- - " <p> " And you were n't here when I got home . How was your run ? " <p> She heard the simple reasoning in his veiled question . If she had waited for him , if she had called , if she had n't done exactly what she 'd wanted and gone for a run , she could 've spent the last hour with him . She had to agree . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waited as long as I could , but I 've really got to get back to the lab . I had an incredible day so far , gorgeous results , but we 're not done , and I 've got to analyze the numbers before we get started again in the morning . I only came home to see you . " <p> " I need to talk about this with you now . " <p> " This really is n't new information , Ali . We disagree about Lydia . Ca n't it wait until I get back ? " <p> " No . " <p> " You want to walk over with me , talk about it on the way ? " <p> " I 'm not going to the office , I need to be home . " <p> " You need to talk now , you need to be home , you 're awfully needy all of the sudden . Is something else going on ? " <p> The word ' needy ' smacked a vulnerable nerve . Needy equaled weak , dependent , pathological . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never being like that , like him . <p> " I 'm just exhausted . " <p> " You look it , you need to slow down . " <p> " That 's not what I need . " <p> He waited for her to elaborate , but she took too long . <p> " Look , the sooner I go , the sooner I 'll be back . Get some rest , I 'll be home later tonight . " <p> He kissed her sweat-drenched head and walked out the door . <p> Standing in the hallway where he left her , with no one to confess to or confide in , the full emotional impact of what she 'd just experienced in Harvard Square flooded over her . She sat down on the floor and leaned against the cool wall , watching her hands shake in her lap as if they could n't be hers . She tried to focus on steadying her breath as she did when she ran . <p> After minutes of breathing in and breathing out , she was finally calm enough to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thought about the missing word during her talk at Stanford and her missing period . She got up , turned on her laptop , and Googled MENOPAUSE SYMPTOMS . <p> An appalling list filled the screen -- hot flashes , night sweats , insomnia , crashing fatigue , anxiety , dizziness , irregular heart beat , depression , irritability , mood swings , disorientation , mental confusion , memory lapses . <p> Disorientation , mental confusion , memory lapses . Check , check , and check . She leaned back in her chair and raked her fingers back and forth through her curly , black hair . She looked over at the pictures displayed on the shelves of the floor-to-ceiling bookcase -- her Harvard graduation day , she and John dancing on their wedding day , family portraits from when the kids were little , a family portrait from Anna 's wedding . She returned to the list on her computer screen . This was just the natural , next phase in her life as a woman . Millions of women coped with it every day . Nothing life-threatening . Nothing abnormal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her doctor for a checkup . Maybe she should go on estrogen replacement therapy . She read through the list of symptoms one last time . Irritability . Mood swings . Her recent shrinking fuse with John . It all added up . Satisfied , she shut down her computer . <p> She sat in the darkening study a while longer , listening to her quiet house and the sounds of neighborhood barbeques . She inhaled the smell of hamburger grilling . For some reason , she was n't hungry anymore . She took a multivitamin with water , unpacked , read several articles from The Journal of Cognition , and went to bed . <p> Some time after midnight , John finally came home . His weight in their bed woke her , but only slightly . She remained still and pretended to stay asleep . He had to be exhausted from being up all night and working all day . They could talk about Lydia in the morning . And she 'd apologize for being so sensitive and moody lately . His warm hand on her hip brought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her neck , she fell into a deep sleep , convinced that she was safe . <p> Copyright 2007 , 2009 by Lisa Genova <br> Continues ...
