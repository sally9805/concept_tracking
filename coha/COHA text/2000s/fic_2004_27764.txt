Quarter past six . In ten minutes , Wendy would have to get in the shower . Her clock radio came on . a newsman was talking about the elections for mayor of new York City . She switched to music . Madonna . She went through her new school clothes in her head , thinking up combinations . Her mother said the great thing about the gray pants was how you could wear them with anything , but when she wore them yesterday , she 'd felt as if she was playing dress-up . Nobody else in eighth grade had pants like that . She wished she 'd gotten the pruple-and-grea-plaid kilt instead , that her mom said was impractical . her mom , who owned three different-colored feather boas and red velvet harem pants , a leopard-print cat suit , and a tutu , not to mention all her old Peachy Puffs getups . Do you think I 'm fat ? Wendy said . Her mother was a size four , and they could share clothes now , but Wendy could tell that before long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course not . All I meant was they make you look even slimmer than usual . I 'm fat , are n't I , Wendy told her . You 've got a perfect body . Much nicer than if you were on of those stick-figure types . I always wished I had a shape . In other words I 'm chunky , said Wendy . You look just right , her mother said . Your bones are bigger , that 's all . Louie opened the door partway , just enough that she could see a corner of his face , eyes crusty , thumb in mouth . Are you dry ? He told her yes . Positive ? There 's just this one little drip but it got soaked up in my sleeper suit , so it does n't count . He stood there holding Pablo , with the old blue ribbon from when Pablo was new wrapped around his thumb . He liked to twirl the tip of the ribbon in his ear with his free hand while he sucked on the thumb of the other hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He positioned himself in the bed so every inch of the side closest to Wendy was touching some part of her . She could hear the slurping sound his lips made on his thumb , and his breathing , slow and quiet , still labored from last week 's cold . One two three four . he was counting the rabbits on her pajama bottoms though after twelve or thirteen , he usually gave up . I dreamed we got a puppy , he said . The two of them had been after their parnts about that forever . What kind ? With spots . Little and fuzzy . Are you going to school again today ? he said . I already explained to you , Louie . I got to school every day now except Saturday and Sunday . Five days in a row , school and two days home , only probably a lot of times I 'll be sleeping over at Amelia 's Friday nights . I want you to stay home with me , he said . She could hear the shower running in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bathroom , even though Josh was n't her real father , only Louie 's . It was easier , plus he seemed more like her father than her real one . You 'll be going to school too pretty soon anyway , she told him . Thursday is preschool orientation , remember ? You might want to work on not sucking your thumb so much . The other kids might make fun of you . I changed my mind , he said . I do n't want to go to preschool after all . I want to stay home and play with you . Well , I 'm not going to be home , she said . And even if I was , I probably would n't play that much . Why ? I 'm not in that stage anymore . Once you get to my stage in life , you want to do different kinds of things . What ? Josh was making French toast . The kitchen smelled of just-ground coffee beans and frying butter . He was playing the Teach Yourself Spanish tape . Part one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the trip to Mexico scheduled for next spring , when Wendy was going to stay at Amelia 's or possibly to California to visit her real dad , but she was n't supposed to count on this . It had been nearly three years since she 'd seen him . Her mother had said they could n't afford a trip to Mexico , but Josh told her she worried too much . Six months from now , I could get his by a bus , he said , and boy would you ever wish you 'd gone on that trip . The coffeepot made the sound that meant the coffee was ready , Josh poured himself a cup of coffee . Louie hopped in on one foot . He had taken off his cape now and replaced it with the cummerbund from his Aladdin costume . All week he 'd been working on his skipping , and now he was circling the table , making little frog jumps . He had n't figured out yet how to alternate his feet . Hola , muchacho ! said Josh . Blabbyblaba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already poured it . At your servicio , seor . The voice on the tape was reviewing yesterday 's lesson . Donde esta la estacion central de autobus ? he repeated . Wendy studied Josh 's face as he stood at the stove , holding the spatula . She had been wondering if people looked different right after they had sex , but he looked the same as usual . His hair was going in all different directions , but it always did first thing in the morning . He had n't shaved yet , and he was wearing the same old green sweatpants and his Yankees T-shirt from last summer 's subway series . He was n't handsome like her father , and he did n't have her father 's six-pack , that made Amelia call him a hunk when she saw his picture . Josh had curly black hair and the kind of face you 'd like to see if you had a problem . Powdered sugar on yours , miss ? he asked . He set down a pitcher of maple syrup in front of her . Heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calories today , but now she poured a pool of syrup on her plate . Mom up yet ? She 's a little tired this morning , he said . I told her she should call in sick , but she said she 'd just skip breakfast instead and take a later train . They had sex all night . Wendy thought so before , but now she was sure . She was supposed to fill in my field trip permission forms and the one about who to contact in an emergency , Wendy told him . My homeroom teacher said not to leave it to the last day . Also , I want to talk to her about my clarinet . They gave me a really crummy rental . I was thinking maybe we could buy one instead . It was n't the permission forms that were making the sharp sound in her voice , she knew , or the clarinet , either . She was thinking about the agument they 'd had last night about her going to California . She wanted to visit her father . Her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You never let me do anything , Wendy had told her . As usual , Josh had tried to make peace . We 'll talk about the clarinet tonight , he said . Meanwhile , I 'll sign the forms . Let your mom have an extra ten minutes sleep . For a second , Josh got a look on his face that reminded her of Louie when he stood at the bus with her that first morning she went off to junior high . What do you say we give it a try this once , he said , reaching for the form . Father or no father , if you get injured in some knock-down-drag-out volley &shy; ball game , I 'm probably the one who 'll come running down to school to get you . Watching Josh as he took out the jar of raisins , arranging them on Louie 's plate in the shape of a man , Wendy felt crummy for saying what she had . Do you have any idea how lucky we are to have someone like Josh in our life ? her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she knew she had just now . Do you even remember what it was like before he came along ? Do you think Garrett would ever put himself out for you the way Josh does ? I do n't know why I say the mean things I do , she told Amelia . My parents are just getting on my nerves so much lately . Sometimes these horrible re &shy; marks ooze out of me . Maybe you 're possessed , Amelia said . We could perform an exorcism . Ame &shy; lia had seen a video recently where that happened to a girl , and when they finally held the exorcism ceremony , all this horrible green vomit squirted out of her mouth and her head swiveled around like a cartoon character . On TV , the weatherman was pointing to a map of New York and saying it looked like perfect weather clear through the weekend . Better grab yourself one last dose of summer , folks . No excuse not to get out and vote today . Josh had been making her a sandwich . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got Macintosh , she said . I like Granny Smith , remember ? I did n't want raisins , Louie told Josh . I wanted chocolate chips . We do n't have chocolate for breakfast , Lou-man , Josh told him . As for you , Miss Picky , the Granny Smiths at the market were n't any good . But Sissy gets hot chocolate , Louie said . That 's chocolate . Just not in the shape of a chip . Tell you what , son , Josh said . You eat the raisins , and tonight we 'll make ourselves some chocolate-chip cookies . Maybe you can bring in a few extra on Thursday for you know what . I want Mama to come too , when I go to preschool , said Louie . Mama would n't miss it , Josh said . That 's why she decided not to take the day off today . So she could be there with you Thursday . Back when her mother first introduced her to Josh , she meant to hate him . She was only seven then . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , called Parent Trap , where a couple of twins whose parents were divorced decided to get them back together , and it worked . Even though Wendy did n't have a twin like the girls in the movie , that was her plan . She was mean to him that first night at the restaurant . She did n't order anything except water , even though sushi was her favorite . I was just wondering , Josh said to her as she sat there , not even touching the soybeans that she loved , what is your opinion of miniature golf ? She had never been miniature golfing but she always wanted to . There was a course called Dreamland they sometimes passed on their way to Fire Island that her mom said they 'd stop at someday , but they never had . Josh took them there , and after that , when Wendy 's mother said it was n't really her type of activity , it got to be something he and Wendy did , on Saturday afternoons when her mom and Kate went to yoga . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get married to her mom . I could understand if you are n't too thrilled , he said . I know you 've got a dad , and it 's understandable that you 'd like it a whole lot better if he was with your mother instead of me . But I promise I 'll try hard to make her happy . And I 'll teach you every single thing you ever wanted to know about jazz . Which was nothing . She was the flower girl . All that day , she kept thinking about the Parent Trap video and waiting for her real father to come crashing in and say something like Janet , it was an a terrible mistake . Come back to me . What are you doing hanging around with this chubby guy with hair on his shoulders and love handles , when you could be with me ? Even after it was all over , and Josh 's mom was hugging her , and she had on so much perfume , Wendy could hardly breathe , and saying how she 'd always wished she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen that would make him disappear . But the next thing she knew , Josh was moving his clothes into her mother 's room and building a bunch of shelves for his collection of old jazz LPs . Sometimes at night , she could hear them having sex . Josh was a stand-up bass player . He worked weekends mostly , usually Fridays and Saturday nights , and sometimes he 'd get hired to play at a wedding , but he was usually home during the day , except when he gave lessons . He loved to cook , and instead of take-out Chinese and pizza , he made them things like eggplant parmigiana and roast chicken with garlic mashed potatoes . One day , he found a box of Duncan Hines brownie mix in their cupboard . He took it in to the living room , where Wendy and her mother were watching a video of The Music Man . Janet , he said in a voice that was so serious , Wendy actually worried he was mad . She 'd never heard him get mad before . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always nice to you sound angry all of a sudden . Not like her father , who she could remember sounding mad , even though she1d been so little when he left . Now Josh was holding the box of Duncan Hines in front of her mother , like evidence . I h6pe and pray this is the last time an item like this ever makes its way into our kitchen . Just tell me it was temporary insanity . I bought that a long time ago , her mother said . I did n't think I 'd never ' mow anyone who could make us brownies from scratch . I swear I 'll never in my whole life buy another box of Duncan Hines . Then Wendy knew it was a joke , because the look on her mother 's face was like some character in a soap opera whose husband just found out she was in love with someone else . When she said that , he put his arms around her and made a sound like a bear in the forest , a low , happy growling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stump full of the sweetest honey deep in the underbrush . Something about the way the two of them looked at each other like that made it seem as if they were the only two people in the world . It was Josh , not her mother , who seemed to know Wendy was feeling that way , because he looked up at her then . Knowing your mother 's talents in the kitchen , he said , I can tell the only hope I 'll ever have of handing down my secret time-tested brownie recipe is if I teach it to you . Wendy and Josh melted the chocolate over the double boiler . You melted the butter in with the chocolate . Butter , never margarine , he told her . He showed her how to sift flour and beat the eggs with the sugar till they made a golden-colored froth , and he let her be the one to pour the melted chocolate mixture into the eggs , very slowly , so at first it was part dark brown , part creamy yellow swirls , until gradually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now for the most important part , he said . Putting it in the oven ? Oh my God , he said . You have even more to learn than I thought . He reached for a package of pecans and poured a bunch into a plastic sandwich bag . He took out his big wooden rolling pin . Josh did n't come with much stuff when he moved in with them . A box of clothes , his string bass , a picture of himself with his sister and his parents when he was around nine , and a stuffed rabbit , also from when he was little . Not a whole lot else . But the rolling pin was his . Wendy 's mom never owned one before . Let 's say there 's this boy in your class who keeps getting on your nerves , making fart sounds when the teacher is n't looking , he said . Do you know anyone like that ? The thing was , she did . Or some girl who tells you she is n't going to invite you to her birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you really wanted to go because everyone else in your clan was going to be there . This also had happened . Here 's what you do about it , he said . He held the rolling pin over the bag of pecans . Continues ...
