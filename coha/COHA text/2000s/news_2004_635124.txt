<p> Despite finding his scoring touch in the Montreal Canadiens ' playoff series against the Boston Bruins , forward Alexei Kovalev found himself the subject of a firestorm after his turnover led to the game-winning goal in the second overtime of Game 4 that gave the Bruins a 3-1 lead . <p> Kovalev said his hand went numb after he was slashed by the Bruins ' Travis Green . But he was criticized because he ignored the puck after the incident , and while shaking his hand  --  to alleviate the pain or embellish the injury in the hopes of drawing a penalty , depending on your take  --  he ran into Canadiens defenseman Sheldon Souray . That created a breakaway opportunity for the Bruins ' Glen Murray , who beat goalie Jose Theodore to win the game . <p> You have to protect the puck or get rid of it , " Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur told the Montreal Gazette . Kovalev was not dying . I saw the slash on his glove , and it was not a hard shot . It was n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glove . I do n't know , maybe he was trying to get attention from a referee to give them a penalty . <p> But you do n't do things like that . You do n't shake your arm and let the puck go and then not look where you 're going . Sheldon Souray did n't look , either , so they looked like two chickens with no heads . " <p> Souray and coach Claude Julien criticized Kovalev after the game for losing the puck . <p> I saw he got slashed , " Souray said . Maybe it should be a penalty , but do you stop playing ? In double overtime ? " <p> Kovalev thought it should have been a penalty , but he also thought he was to blame for the loss . Souray and Julien softened their comments the next day , and the team responded with a 5-1 victory Thursday in Game 5 . Kovalev scored a goal in that game , which redeemed him somewhat in the eyes of his teammates and fans . <p> It was difficult , " Kovalev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worried about those things . The most important thing for me is how I feel and how my teammates feel . The rest , I do n't really care . " <p> The Bruins believed justice was served with the turnover because they thought Canadiens center Mike Ribeiro had faked an injury in Game 3 . Ribeiro said he suffered a pinched nerve , but the Bruins were not too happy after Ribeiro returned to the bench and was smiling and laughing . Ribeiro drew a whistle after he went down with the Bruins in attack mode in the final minute of the Canadiens ' 3-2 victory . <p> You see it happen all the time in this game , " Bruins goalie Andrew Raycroft said . You do one thing and might get away with it every once in a while , but you always get it back at some point . I 'm sure it had a lot to do with it . These refs , they were made to look like idiots the last game , and they do n't want that to happen again . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a little bit to do with it . " <p> Michael Nylander <p> Boston Bruins <p> Michael Nylander missed most of the season with a broken leg , but he has been an offensive weapon for the Bruins in their series against the Montreal Canadiens . Nylander , who was traded by the Washington Capitals to the Bruins at the deadline , had a goal in each of the first three playoff games he played . <p> Nylander missed Game 3 , saying he was experiencing flu-like symptoms , but he did n't miss a beat when he returned for Game 4 on Tuesday . There was speculation he had suffered a concussion because of a hit , but Nylander and the team denied it . <p> " Having been off the ice for a couple of days , it 's fun , " Nylander said Tuesday . " It 's playoff time , and I feel I can play . " <p> After Game 4 , his three goals had him among the leaders in goal-scoring during the playoffs . <p> Nylander said he does n't believe the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . <p> " It 's hard to judge , " he told the Boston Herald . " I just try to work on my own things , stay in good shape and play good hockey . I try not to think of it as just 18 games or 20 or 30 or 50 games . Right now , it 's just one game at a time . " <p> OPENING FACEOFF <p> " They 're an arrogant team , no question about that . They think they 're better than us . We 're here , and we deserve to be here . " <p> TOMAS VOKOUN , Nashville Predators goalie , on the Detroit Red Wings <p> SLAP SHOTS <p> TOUGH LOVE : Reporters love good quotes , but coaches have to be careful talking about players with the media . A lot of times , calling out players in the media is seen as a negative . But Calgary Flames coach Darryl Sutter received a lot of praise last week for his success in motivating his players with strong public statements . <p> " It 's not criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the most and best out of people . It 's all about accountability . Well , who 's holding whom accountable ? " <p> Forward Jarome Iginla responded in Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks after Sutter said he looked nervous in Game 1 , and forwards Chris Clark , Shean Donovan and Martin Gelinas played well in Game 4 after Sutter questioned their offense . Defenseman Denis Gauthier also responded in Game 4 after Sutter pointed out his shortcomings . <p> " It 's not always fun , " forward Craig Conroy told the Calgary Herald . " You hear it in the room , then it 's in the paper . It 's not the best . But that 's the way Darryl does things . He likes to challenge you in the papers . And it works for him . " <p> HURTING : Canucks goalie Dan Cloutier wanted to prove himself during the series against the Flames , but he sprained his right ankle . <p> " The timing of it is very frustrating , " Cloutier said . " I was looking forward to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my game going into the playoffs . All of a sudden , you get an injury . It 's hard to take . " <p> Cloutier will be a restricted free agent this summer , and some have wondered about his future with the team . <p> " I think I 've proven that I 'm a pretty good goalie in this league , " Cloutier said . " For me to start to worry if I 'm going to be back or not , I 'm not going to really focus on that . " <p> PAYBACK : When the Tampa Bay Lightning equipment staff arrived last Sunday at Nassau Coliseum , they only could get into the visitors ' dressing room . The training room and other areas the Lightning had used in the past were padlocked . <p> Before Game 3 on Monday , Lightning coach John Tortorella and New York Islanders general manager Mike Milbury got into an argument about the lack of access . It appeared the Islanders were creating the difficulties because they were upset they had to stay in a different hotel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before home games . <p> The Lightning equipment staff also blocked a hallway outside the visitors ' dressing room Monday , blocking the Islanders ' path to the exit used by the players . That situation was resolved , too , and both teams put it in the past . <p> DOUBTING THOMAS : Detroit Red Wings coach Dave Lewis said it probably was the toughest thing he has done as a coach , but he decided to make winger Steve Thomas a healthy scratch in Game 4 of the series against the Nashville Predators . He replaced him with Boyd Devereaux . <p> " He 's not happy because I took him out of the lineup , and I do n't blame him , " Lewis said . " All he wants to do is play , all he wants to do is help this team win , and that 's the greatest attitude you can have . " <p> Thomas fired a puck around the boards and knocked over some sticks in frustration after learning about the decision . <p> " He just does n't think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Boyd out there , " Thomas told the Detroit Free Press . " I 'm a little disappointed . I thought I had fairly good speed , but I do n't know . I 'm just not playing that well right now . I 'd be lying if I was going to tell you that I did n't see it coming .
