Stephen Ceci , Ph.D. , lays out 12 facts about intelligence that may astound even the experts . Photograph Photograph // Every culture has a word for " smart , " and for " stupid . " And everyone feels entitled to have an opinion about intelligence . Unlike , say , brain surgery , Intelligence Is not an area of expertise that Is considered offlimits . Because if$ something that our society particularly values , just about everyone has taken a lost that measures intelligence , whether it 's billed as an NO lost or not . Will you be assigned to the radar corps or the mass tent ? OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES , A NATIONAL DEBATE HAS raged about intelligence : what is it , who has it and how do we measure it ? The argument is fueled by findings from two camps of research . There are the psychometricians , who look at the statistics and biology of IQ and try to determine how much of intelligence is innate . And then there are the cultural ecologists , who focus on environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of IQ tests . Unfortunately , the two lines of study seldom meet because their methods are so different . Rarely does one camp communicate with the other . That leaves most ordinary citizens on the outside of the debate , free to cling to their personal beliefs about intelligence . The only trouble is our theories of intelligence are too narrowly constructed . They tend to ignore real data , even though a voluminous literature exists on the topic . At the very least , intelligence can be defined as the ability for complex thinking and reasoning . One thing the research shows for sure : much of the ability for complex reasoning depends on the situation . A person can be a genius at the racetrack but a dolt in the stock market , even though both pursuits require comparable mental activities . But the knowledge is organized in the mind differently in different domains , so what a person knows about the track can lie fallow on Wall Street . I would like to present a dozen research-supported facts about intelligence that most people , including some IQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlates with some simple abilities Glance at the two lines below in Figure I and decide which is longer ; now decide whether the two letters in each pair of figure lb have the same name or are physically identical . Finally , name the number in 1c . Simple , huh ? No one with a measurable IQ has difficulty answering that the line on the right is longer . But those with a higher IQ respond to the question faster . Even individuals with an IQ below 70 can do this task at a high level of accuracy , but they need up to five times longer than subjects with a higher IQ . This may be because such tasks require a series of physiological processes , and the nervous systems of individuals with low IQs are less efficient , requiring longer , visual displays . Whether you accept this explanation , studies show that IQ is modestly related to the speed at which you do some pretty simple things . FACT 2 : IQ is affected by school attendance Although intelligence does influence the decision to stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , more accurately , prevent it from slipping . Each additional month a student remains in school may increase his IQ above what would have been expected had he dropped out . The idea that schooling increases IQ may surprise anyone who views it as a measure of innate intelligence . The earliest evidence comes from the turn of the last century , when the London Board of Education studied children who had very low IQ scores . The report revealed that the IQ of children in the same family decreased from the youngest to the oldest . The youngest group-ages 4 to 6-had an average IQ of 90 , and the oldest children-12 to 22-had an average of only 60 . This suggests that factors other than heredity are at work . The older children progressively missed more school , and their IQs plummeted as a result . A few other facts about school attendance : IQ is affected by delayed schooling . Researchers in South Africa studied the intellectual functioning of children of Indian ancestry . For each year of delayed schooling , the children experienced a decrement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. IQ is affected by remaining in school longer . Toward the end of the Vietnam War , a draft priority was established by lottery . Men born on July 9 , 1951 were picked first so they tended to stay in school longer to avoid the draft ; while men born July 7 had no incentive to stay in school longer because they were picked last in the lottery . As a result , men born on July 9 not only had higher IQs , they also earned more money-approximately 7% more . Dropping out of school can also diminish IQ . In a large-scale study , 10% of all males in the Swedish school population born in 1948 were randomly selected and given an IQ test at age 13 . Upon reaching age 18 ( in 1966 ) , 4,616 of them were tested again . For each year of high school not completed , there was a loss of 1.8 IQ points . IQ is affected by summer vacations . Two independent studies have documented that there is a systematic decline in IQ scores over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , children lose ground from their end-ofyear scores . The decline is pronounced for children whose summers are least academically oriented . FACT 3 : IQ Is not Influenced by birth order The idea that birth order influences personality and intelligence is long-standing . First-horns are allegedly smarter and more likely to become leaders than are later-born siblings . Recently , however , this belief has come up against scrutiny . The idea that large families make low-IQ children may be unfounded because researchers have discovered that low-IQ parents actually make large families . The truth is that smart people tend to have small families , but it is not small families per se that make people smart . Hence , birth order does n't predict IQ , and there is no causal role for family size in determining a child 's IQ . Also , no structural aspects of family size influence a child 's IQ . Otherwise two siblings closer in age would have more similar IQs than two siblings spaced far apart . But this is not the case . Photograph IQ Birth order does n't predict IQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in determining a child 's IQ. // Figure 1 . // FACT 4 : IQ Is related to breast-feeding My colleagues and I were skeptical when we first heard claims that breast-fed infants grew into children with higher IQs than their siblings who were not breast-fed . There are factors that differ between breast-fed and non-breast-fed children , such as the amount of time mother and child spend together through nursing and the sense of closeness they gain from nursing . It turns out , however , that even when researchers control for such factors , there still appears to be a gain of 3 to 8 IQ points for breast-fed children by age three . Exactly why is unclear . Perhaps the immune factors in mother 's milk prevent children from getting diseases that deplete energy and impair early learning . Breast milk may also affect nervous system functioning . Mother 's milk is an especially rich source of omega-3 fatty acids that are building blocks of nerve cell membranes and crucial to the efficient transmission of nerve impulses . FACT 5 : IQ varies by birth date Most states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as policies mandating attendance until age 16 or 17 . School attendance drops off for students born during the final three months of the year , as they are more likely to enter school a year later . When these individuals come of age , they have been in school one year less than their classmates . Researchers have shown that for each year of schooling completed , there is an IQ gain of approximately 3.5 points . Students born late in the year , as a group , show a lower IQ score . Given the random processes involved in being born early versus late within a given year , we can assume that the genetic potential for intelligence is the same in both groups . FACT 6 : IQ evens out with age Imagine interviewing two biological siblings , adopted by two different middle class families , at age five and again at 18 . Will their IQs be more alike when they are younger and living in the homes of their adoptive parents , or when they are older and living on their own ? Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're younger because they are under the influence of their respective middle class parents . Once they are on their own , they may diverge as they become exposed to different experiences that may influence their intelligence differently . But according to data , this is n't true . As these siblings go out on their own , their IQ scores become more similar . The apparent reason is that once they are away from the dictates of their adoptive parents , they are free to let their genotypes express themselves . Because they share approximately 50% of their segregating genes , they will become more alike because they are propelled to seek similar sorts of environments . Genes may be more potent in making siblings alike than similarities in home environments . FACT 7 : Intelligence Is plural , not singular Regardless of their views about the existence and the strength of so-called general intelligence , researchers agree that statistically independent mental abilities exist-such as spatial , verbal , analytical and practical intelligence . In 1995 , Yale psychologist Robert Sternberg and colleagues developed new evidence that practical and analytical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills of practical intelligence , such as common sense , were important in predicting life outcomes , but were not associated with IQ-type analytic intelligence . There may even be at least seven or eight different kinds of intelligence , says researcher Howard Gardner of Harvard , including interpersonal , intrapersonal , linguistic , motoric and musical intelligence . FACT 8 : IQ In correlated with head size The relationship between head size and IQ has long been a subject of controversy . Popular writers such as Stephen J. Gould have rightly objected to the crude and biased means 19th-century scholars used to establish this correlation , which were based on head size and contour . But modern neuroimaging techniques demonstrate that cranial volume is correlated with IQ . Evidence also comes from studies of the helmet sizes of members of the Armed Services , whose IQs were measured during basic training . The correlations , however , are quite small . FACT 9 : Itelligence scores are predictive of real-wodd outcomes People who have completed more school tend to earn more-over a lifetime , college graduates earn $812,000 more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly $1,600,000 more than the college grads . But more schooling ca n't be the only factor in earning differences , because at every level of schooling , there is a variety of intellectual ability . As Figure 2 shows , even among those with comparable levels of schooling , the greater a person 's intellectual ability , the higher that person 's weekly earnings . Workers with the lowest levels of intellectual ability earn only two-thirds the amount workers at the highest level earn . Because differences in schooling are statistically controlled , the rise in earning must be due to other factors , such as intelligence . FACT 10 : IntelligenceIn context-dependent The setting in which we measure intelligence matters . In 1986 , a colleague and I published a study of men who frequented the racetracks daily . Some were excellent handicappers , while others were not . What distinguished experts from non-experts was the use of a complex mental algorithm that converted racing data taken from the racing programs sold at the track . The use of the algorithm was unrelated to the men 's IQ scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the low 80s , but they reasoned far more complexly at the track than all non-experts-even those with IQs in the upper 120s . Photograph IQ For each year of school completed , there is an IQ gain of approximately 3.5 points // In fact , experts were always better at reasoning complexly than non-experts , regardless of their IQ scores . But the same experts who could reason so well at the track were often abysmal at reasoning outside the track-about , say , their retirement pensions or their social relationships . FACT 11- IQ Is an the rise IQ has risen approximately 20 points with every generation , a steady increase called the " Flynn Effect , " after New Zealand political scientist James Flynn . If people taking an IQ test today were scored with the norms of their grandparents ' performances 50 years ago , more than 90% of them would classifted as " geniuses , " while if our grandparents were scored today , most of them would be classed as " borderline mentally retarded . " No one believes that real intelligence has risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd do just as well on IQ tests as they did a half century ago . Photograph The rise in 10 has been attributed to many factors , such as better nutrition , more schooling and better-educated parents . // Figure 2. // The rise in IQ has been attributed to many factors , such as better nutrition , more schooling , better-educated parents and more complex spatial environments thanks to smart toys and computers . The rise in IQ suggests that whatever it is that IQ tests test , it is not some inherent quality of the mind . FACT 12 : IQ my be influenced by the school cafeteria menu Recent research appears to confirm our mothers ' wisdom that diet influences brain functioning . Eat your fish ; it 's brain food . In one large-scale analysis of approximately 1 million students enrolled in the New York City school system , researchers examined IQ scores before and after preservatives , dyes , colorings and artificial flavors were removed from lunch offerings . They found a 14% improvement after the removal . And the improvement was greatest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120,000 of the students were performing two or more grade levels below average . Afterward , the figure dropped to 50,000 . Intelligence , IQ , heredity and ecology are intertwined in complex and intriguing ways . Technical journals are awash with data , and one should consider the facts before leaping to conclusions about what is and what is not intelligence . We should all challenge the implicit theories of intelligence ; otherwise we are in danger of misinterpreting the truth .
