Chapter 1 : Fan Number One Natalie could n't take it . She peeked in the doorway of the school library , then turned , took six steps down the hall , turned , paced back , and stopped to look in at Zoe again . The suspense was torture . Zoe was still reading . The first two chapters only added up to twelve pages . Natalie leaned against the door frame and chewed on her thumbnail . She thought , What 's taking her so long ? Zoe could see Natalie out of the corner of her eye . She could feel all that nervous energy nudging at her , but Zoe was n't about to be rushed . She always read slowly , and she liked it that way , especially when it was a good story . And this one was good . The Cheater by Natalie Nelson page 12 I catch up with Sean between Eighty-second and Eighty-first Streets . His legs are longer than mine , so I 'm panting . I grab his arm and he stops in front of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " I 've got to talk to you . " " Yeah , well , too bad . You had your chance to talk during the Penalty Board hearing . And you did n't . " " But if I told the truth , then the whole school would know I cheated . I 'd get expelled . " He just looks at me . " But you really did cheat , right ? ... And I really did n't steal that answer key , right ? ... And you know I did n't steal it because you did , right ? " I nod yes to all the questions . Sean is almost shouting now , his eyes wild . " So first you steal , then you cheat , and now you 've lied . And me ? You 've left me to take the punishment . " The shopkeeper is worried . He moves from the counter to the doorway of the bodega , looking at us . Sean ignores him and gets right into my face , screaming . " Well , guess what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know if we ever were ! " He storms away , hands jammed in his pockets , shoulders hunched , stabbing the sidewalk with every step . Me , I cry . Zoe let page twelve slip onto the table and then stared at it , deep in thought . " So , what do you think ? " Natalie was right behind her , and Zoe jumped six inches . " Jeez , Natalie ! Scare me to death ! And you ruined a nice moment too . " " But what do you think ? Is it any good ? " Zoe nodded . " I think it 's very good . " " Really ? " Natalie pulled out a chair and sat down , leaning forward . " I mean , you 're not just saying that because we 're best friends ? " Zoe shook her head . " No , I mean it . It 's good . Like I ca n't wait to read the whole thing . Can you bring the rest tomorrow ? " Natalie smiled and reached into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber band around it . " Here . I 've still got to write about five more chapters . I just needed to know if the beginning was any good , but you can read what I 've got done if you want . " Zoe took the folder carefully and said , " This is great . But you are going to finish it , right ? Do you know the whole story already like all the way to the end ? " Natalie said , " Not all the way to the end ... but almost . I know how the end feels , but not exactly what happens at least , not yet . " Natalie 's book had begun by accident on the bus with her mom late one afternoon back in September . Sixth grade was already three weeks old , and both she and her mom had settled into the routine of commuting together . It was a Friday afternoon , and they were going home on the 5:55 coach , thundering through the Lincoln Tunnel from New York City to Hoboken , New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilted toward her on the headrest . It was a pretty face Prettier than mine , she thought . But there were little lines at the corners of her mother 's eyes and mouth . Care lines , worry lines . Natalie said , " Hard day , Mom ? " Eyes still closed , her mom smiled and nodded . " The editorial department met all day with the marketing department all day . " Natalie asked , " How come ? " When her dad died , Natalie had decided she needed to talk to her mom more . Sometimes she pretended to be interested in her mom 's work at the publishing company even when she was n't . Like now . Her mom said , " Well , the marketing people keep track of what kinds of books kids and parents and teachers are buying . Then they tell us , and we 're supposed to make more books like the ones they think people will buy . " Natalie said , " Makes sense . So , what kinds of books do they want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat back and turned toward Natalie . " Here 's the summary of a six-hour meeting . Ready ? " Natalie nodded . Her mom used a deep voice that sounded bossy . " People , we need to publish more adventure books , more series books , and more school stories . " In her regular voice she said , " That was it . A six-hour meeting for something that could have gone into a one-page memo or a three-line E-mail . " Then Natalie asked , " What 's a school story ? " " A school story is just what it sounds like it 's a short novel about kids and stuff that happens mostly at school . " Natalie thought for a second and then said , " You mean like Dear Mr. Henshaw ? " And her mom said , " Exactly . " Then Natalie said to herself , Hey , who knows more about school than someone who 's right there , five days a week , nine months a year ? I bet I could write a school story . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born . Or almost born . Her career as an author did n't officially spring to life until about four months later on that afternoon in the school library after Zoe read the first two chapters . Because it 's the same for every new author , for every new book . Somebody has to be the first to read it . Somebody has to be the first to say she likes it . Somebody has to be that first fan . And of course , that was Zoe .
