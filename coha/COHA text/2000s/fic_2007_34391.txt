Chapter One Old Friends Richard Gale reflected that his sojourn in the West had been exactly what his disgusted father had predicted-an idling here and a dreaming there , with no objective point or purpose . It was reflection such as this , only more serious and perhaps somewhat desperate , that had brought Gale down to the border . For some time the newspapers had been printing news of Mexican revolution , guerrilla warfare , United States cavalry patrolling the international line , American cowboys fighting with the rebels , and wild stories of bold raiders and bandits . Regarding these rumors Gale was skeptical . But as opportunity , and adventure , too , had apparently given him a wide berth in Montana , Wyoming , Colorado , he had struck southwest for the Arizona border , where he hoped to see some stirring life . He did not care very much what happened . Months of futile wandering in the hope of finding a place where he fitted had inclined Richard to his father 's opinion . It was after dark one evening in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find that it was evidently a town of importance . There was a jostling , jabbering , sombreroed crowd of Mexicans around the railroad station . He felt as if he were in a foreign country . After a while he saw several men of his own nationality , one of whom he engaged to carry his baggage to a hotel . They walked up a wide , well-lighted street , lined with buildings in which were bright windows . Of the many people encountered by Gale , most were Mexicans . His guide explained that the smaller half of Casita lay in Arizona , the other half in Mexico , and of several thousand inhabitants the majority belonged on the southern side of the street , which was the boundary line . He also said that rebels had entered the town that day , causing a good deal of excitement . Gale was almost at the end of his financial resources , which fact occasioned him to turn away from a potential hotel and to ask his guide for a cheaper lodging house . When this was found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a desire for comfort , persuaded Gale to change his traveling clothes for rough outing garb and boots . Well , I 'm almost broke , he soliloquized thoughtfully . The governor said I would n't make any money . He 's right ... so far . And he said I 'd be coming home beaten . There he 's wrong .... I 've got a hunch that something 'll happen to me in this greaser town . He went out into a wide , whitewashed , high-ceilinged corridor and from that into an immense room that , but for pool tables , bar , and benches , would have been like a courtyard . The floor was cobble-stoned , the walls were of adobe , and the large windows opened like doors . A blue cloud of smoke filled the place . Gale heard the click of pool balls and the clink of glasses along the crowded bar . Bare-legged , sandal-footed Mexicans in white rubbed shoulders with Mexicans mantled in black and red . There were others in tight-fitting blue uniforms with gold fringe or tassels at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns and evidently were the rurales , or native policemen . There were black-bearded , coarse-vis-aged Americans , some gambling around the little tables , others drinking . The pool tables were the center of a noisy crowd of younger men , several of whom were unsteady on their feet . There were khaki-clad cavalrymen strutting in and out . At one end of the room , somewhat apart from the general mle , was a group of six men around a little table , four of whom were seated , the other two standing . These last two drew a second glance from Gale . The sharp-featured , bronzed faces and piercing eyes , the tall , slender , loosely-jointed bodies , the quiet , easy , reckless air that seemed to be a part of the men-these things would plainly have stamped them as cowboys , without the buckled sombreros , the colored scarves , the high-topped , high-heeled boots with great silver-rowelled spurs . Gale did not fail to note , also , that these cowboys wore guns , and this fact was rather a shock to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give some credence to the rumors of fighting along the border , and he sustained a thrill . He satisfied his hunger in a restaurant adjoining , and , as he stepped back into the saloon , a man wearing a military cape jostled him . Apologies from both were instant . Gale was moving on when the other stopped short , as if startled , and , leaning forward , exclaimed : " Dick Gale ? " " You 've got me , " replied Gale in surprise . " But I do n't know you . " He could not see the fellow 's face because it was wholly shaded by a wide-brimmed hat , pulled well down . " By Jove ! It 's Dick ! If this is n't great ! Do n't you know me ? " " I 've heard your voice somewhere , " replied Gale . " Maybe I 'll recognize you if you come out from under that bonnet . " For answer the man hurriedly drew Gale into the restaurant , where he thrust back his hat to disclose a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me .... " " S-sssh . You need n't yell , " interrupted the other as he met Gale 's outstretched hands . There was a close , hard , straining grip . " I must not be recognized here . There are reasons . I 'll explain in a minute . Come on , let 's sit down at this table . " There was a vacant table nearby , and they pulled out chairs and sat down . " Say , but it 's fine to see you , " Thorne continued . " Five years , Dick , five years since I saw you run down University Field and spread-eagle the whole Wisconsin football team . " " Do n't recollect that , " replied Dick , laughing . " George , I 'll bet you I 'm gladder to see you than you are to see me . It seems so long . You went into the Army , did n't you ? " " I did . I 'm here now with the Ninth Cavalry . But . . . never mind me . What 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just noticed your togs . Dick , you ca n't be going in for mining or ranching , not in this god-forsaken desert ? " " On the square , George , I do n't know any more why I 'm here than ... than you know . " " Well , that beats me , " ejaculated Thorne , sitting back in his chair , amazement and concern in his expression . " What the devil 's wrong ? Your old man has too much money for you ever to be up against it . Dick , you could n't have gone to the bad . " A tide of emotion moved over Gale . How good it was to meet a friend-someone to whom he could talk ! He had never appreciated his loneliness until that moment . " George , how I ever drifted down here I do n't know . I did n't exactly quarrel with the governor . But ... damn it , Dad hurt me ... shamed me , and I dug out for the West . It was this way . After leaving college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another that he set me to do . On the square I had no head for business . I made a mess of everything and the governor got sore . He kept ramming the harpoon into me till I just could n't stand it . What little ability I possessed deserted me when I got my back up , and there you are . Dad and I had a rather uncomfortable half hour . When I quit ... when I told him straight out that I was going West to fare for myself , why it would n't have been so tough if he had n't laughed at me . He called me a rich man 's son ... an idle , easy-going , spineless swell . He said I did n't even have character enough to be out and out bad . He said I did n't have sense enough to marry one of the nice girls in my sister 's crowd . He said I could n't earn a dollar ... that I 'd starve out West and could n't get back home unless I sent to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could fight ... could really make a fight for anything under the sun . Oh , he shot it into me , all right . " Dick dropped his head , somewhat ashamed of the smarting dimness in his eyes . He had not meant to say so much . Yet what a relief to let out that long-congested burden . " Fight ! " cried Thorne hotly . " What 's ailing him ? Did n't they call you Biff Gale in college ? Dick , you were one of the best men Stagg ever developed . I heard him say so ... that you were the fastest **34;574;TOOLONG man he 'd ever trained , the hardest to stop . " " The governor did n't count football , " said Dick , his face coming up again . " He did n't mean that kind of a fight . When I left home , I do n't think I had an idea what was wrong with me . But , George , I think I know now . I was a rich man 's son ... spoiled , dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't yet discovered any earning capacity in me . I seem to be unable to do anything with my hands . That 's the trouble . But I 'm at the end of my tether now . And I 'm going to punch cattle or be a miner or do some real stunt ... like joining the rebels . " " Aha ! I thought you 'd spring that last one on me , " declared Thorne , wagging his head . " Well , you just forget it . Say , old boy , there 's something doing in Mexico . The U.S. in general does n't realize it . But across that line there are crazy revolutionists , ill-paid soldiers , guerrilla leaders , raiders , robbers , outlaws , bandits galore , starving peons by the thousand , girls and women in terror . Mexico is like some of her volcanoes ... ready to erupt fire and hell . Do n't make the awful mistake of joining the rebel forces . Americans are hated by Mexicans of the lower class ... the fighting class , both rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side , then on the other . If you did n't starve or get shot in ambush or die of thirst , some greaser would knife you in the back for your belt buckle or your boots . There are a good many Americans with the rebels eastward toward Agua Prieta and Jurez . Orozco is operating in Chihuahua , and I guess he has some idea of warfare . But this is Sonora , a mountainous desert , the home of the slave and the Yaqui . There 's unorganized revolt everywhere . The American miners and ranchers , those who could get away , have fled across into the States , leaving property . Those who could n't or would n't come must fight for their lives , are fighting now . " " That 's bad , " said Gale . " It 's news to me . Why does n't the government take action , do something ? " " Afraid of international complications . Do n't want to offend the Maderists , or be criticized by jealous foreign nations . It 's a delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , you can bet . But the U.S. in general is in the dark , and the Army ... well , you ought to hear the inside talk back at San Antonio . We 're patrolling the boundary line . We 're making one grand bluff . I could tell you of a dozen instances where cavalry should have pursued raiders on the other side of the line . But we do n't do it . The officers are a grouchy lot these days . You see , of course , what significance would attach to U.S. Cavalry going into Mexican territory . There would simply be hell . My own colonel is the sorest man on the job . We 're all sore . It 's like sitting on a powder magazine . We ca n't keep the rebels and raiders from crossing the line . Yet we do n't fight . My commission expires soon . I 'll be discharged in three months . You can bet I 'm glad for more reasons than I 've mentioned . " Thorne was evidently laboring under strong , suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes gleamed with a dark fire . Occasionally his delight at meeting , talking with Gale dominated the other emotion , but not for long . The table where they were seated was near one of the door-like windows leading into the street , and every little while he would glance out sharply . Also he kept consulting his watch . These details gradually grew upon Gale , as Thorne talked . " George , it strikes me that you 're upset , " said Dick . " I seem to remember you as a cool-headed fellow who nothing could disturb . Has the Army changed you ? " Thorne laughed . It was a laugh with a strange high note . It was reckless-it hinted of exaltation . He rose abruptly ; he gave the waiter money to go for drinks ; he looked into the saloon , and then into the street . On this side of the house there was a porch opening on a plaza with trees and shrubbery and benches . Thorne peered out one window , then another . His actions were rapid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and leaned over to look closely into Gale 's face . " I 'm away from camp without leave , " he said . " Is n't that a serious offense ? " asked Dick . " Serious ? For me , if I 'm discovered , it means ruin . There are rebels in town . Any moment we might have trouble . I ought to be ready for duty ... within call . If I 'm discovered , it means arrest . That means delay ... the failure of my plans ... ruin . " Gale was silenced by his friend 's intensity . Thorne bent over closer with his dark eyes searchingly bright . " We were old pals ... once ? " " Surely , " replied Dick . " What would you say , Dick Gale ... if I told you that you 're the one now I 'd rather have had come along than any other ... at this crisis of my life ? " The earnest gaze , the passionate voice with its deep tremor , drew Dick upright , thrilling and eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorne , I should say I was damn glad to be the fellow , " replied Dick . Their hands locked for a moment , then Thorne sat down again , with his head close over the table . " Listen , " he began in low swift whisper . " A few days , a week ago ... it seems like a year ... I was of some assistance to refugees fleeing from Mexico into the States . They were all women and one of them was dressed as a nun . Quite by accident I saw her face . It was that of a beautiful girl . I observed she kept aloof from the others . I suspected a disguise and , when opportunity afforded , spoke to her , offered my services . She replied to my poor efforts at Spanish in fluent English . She had fled in terror from her home , some place down in Sinaloa . Rebels are active there . Her father was captured and held for ransom . When the ransom was paid , the rebels killed him . The leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolution began , he had been feared by the people of class ... loved by the peons . Bandits are worshipped by the peons . All of the famous bandits have robbed the rich and have given to the poor . Rojas saw the daughter , made off with her . But she contrived to bribe her guards , and escaped almost immediately , before any harm befell her . She hid among friends . Rojas nearly tore down the town in his efforts to find her . Then she disguised herself , and traveled by horseback , stage , and train to Casita . " Her story fascinated me , and that one fleeting glimpse I had of her face I could n't forget . She had no friends here , no money . She knew Rojas was trailing her . This talk I had with her was at the railroad station , where all was bustle and confusion . No one noticed us , so I thought . I advised her to remove the disguise of a nun before she left the waiting room . And I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to this place . I had promised to come in the evening to talk over the situation with her . I found her , Dick ... and , when I saw her , I went stark , staring , raving mad over her . She is the most beautiful , wonderful girl I ever saw . Her name is Mercedes Castaeda and she belongs to one of the old wealthy Spanish families . She has lived abroad , and in Havana . She speaks French as well as English . She is ... but I must try to be brief . Dick , think . Think . With Mercedes , also , it was love at first sight . My plan is to marry her and get her farther into the interior , away from the border . It may not be easy . She 's watched . So am I. It was impossible to see her without the women of this place knowing . At first perhaps they had only curiosity ... an itch to gossip . But the last two days there has been a change . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , these Mexicans are subtle , mysterious . After all , they 're Spaniards . They work in secret , in the dark . They are dominated first by religion , then by gold , then by passion for a woman . Rojas must have got word to his friends here . Yesterday his gang of cut-throat rebels arrived , and today he came . When I learned that , I took my chance and left camp . I hunted up a priest . He promised to come here . It 's time he 's due . But I 'm afraid he 'll be stopped . " " Thorne , why do n't you take the girl and get married without waiting , without running these risks ? " said Dick . " I fear it 's too late now . I should have done that last night . You see , we 're still not over the line .... " " Then this is Mexican territory now ? " queried Gale sharply . (               @ @ @ @ @ @
