Late Thursday afternoon , Teri Polgar went to the grocery store . Roaming the air-conditioned aisles , she decided to make her specialty-a macaroni-and-cheese casserole-for dinner that night . Some might consider it more of a winter meal , not really suitable for the middle of July , but Teri liked it any time of year . And Bobby-well , Bobby was hardly aware of what season it was , or for that matter , what time of day . When she got home , she found her husband in front of a chessboard , deep in concentration . That in itself was n't unusual . But the board was set up on the kitchen table and her younger brother was sitting across from him . Two out-of-the-ordinary occurrences . Johnny grinned sheepishly when she walked in with her bag of groceries . " I came by for a quick visit and Bobby insisted on teaching me , " he explained . Bobby mumbled something , probably an acknowledgment of her presence . He often muttered to himself , lost in his own world of chess moves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an understatement . Bobby Polgar was an international chess sensation , one of the top-ranked players in the world . " How 's it going ? " Teri asked as she set the groceries on the counter . Johnny answered with a good-natured shrug . " Have n't got a clue . Ask Bobby . " " Hi , sweetheart , " she said , moving to her husband 's side of the table . Slipping her arms around his neck , she kissed his cheek . Bobby 's hand squeezed hers and he looked across at Johnny . " Always protect your queen , " he advised her brother , who nodded patiently . " Can you stay for dinner ? " she asked Johnny . A visit from him , especially on a weekday , was a pleasant surprise . Teri was proud of Johnny , but she also felt protective of him . That was only natural , she supposed , because she 'd practically raised him herself . Her family-like Bobby , was unconventional-but in a completely different way . At last count , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven ? Teri had lost count . Her sister was more like her mother than Teri had ever been , but at least Christie was smart enough not to marry the losers who walked in and out of her life . Not that Teri was exempt from some of life 's painful lessons herself . Particularly those that fell into the category of men-whouse-and-abuse . Teri still had a hard time believing Bobby Polgar could love her . She worked in a hair and nail salon and considered herself the farthest thing from an intellectual . Bobby always said she had a real-world intelligence , practical and intuitive rather than cerebral , like his . She loved him for saying that and was even starting to believe it . In fact , she loved everything about him . The happiness she felt was still new to her and it actually frightened her a little . She had reasons to be concerned , real-world reasons , she thought wryly , although she made light of them . who looked like they belonged in an episode of The Sopranos . They had gangster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , though , other than scare her for a few minutes . Teri was n't sure what that was all about . Apparently these goons had been sent as a warning to Bobby . The message seemed to be that their boss , whoever he was , could get to her at any time . Fat chance of that ! Teri was street-smart and she 'd learned how to take care of herself , although she had to admit those two had given her pause . If Bobby knew who was responsible for the threat against her , he was n't saying . But she 'd noticed that her husband had n't played in a single tournament since she 'd been approached by those men . " I got ta get back , " Johnny said in answer to her question about dinner . " Just stay for another couple of hours , " she wheedled . " I 'm making my special macaroni-and-cheese casserole . " That would entice her brother like nothing else . It was his favorite dish . " Checkmate , " Bobby said triumphantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a way out of this ? " Johnny asked , returning his attention to the chessboard . Bobby shook his head . " Nope . You 're in the Black Hole . " " The what ? " Teri and Johnny said simultaneously . " The Black Hole , " Bobby told them . " Once a player finds him or herself in this set of circumstances , it 's impossible to win . " Johnny shrugged . " Then there 's nothing left to do but concede . " He laid down his king and sighed . " Really , there was never any doubt as to the outcome of this game . " " You play well for a beginner , " Bobby told him . Teri ruffled her younger brother 's hair , despite knowing how much he hated it . " Consider that a compliment . " Johnny smiled . " I will . " He pushed back his chair and looked at Teri . " Ter , do n't you think it 's time you introduced Bobby to Mom and Christie ? " Bobby turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to meet your family . " " No , you would n't . " She immediately busied herself unpacking the groceries . She set the cottage cheese-an essential ingredient in her macaroni recipe-on the counter , along with a box of Velveeta cheese . " Mom asked me about you and Bobby , " her brother informed her . " Is she still with Donald ? " This was the latest husband . Teri had purposely avoided any discussion of her family with Bobby . They had n't been married long and she hated to disillusion him so soon . Once he met the family , he might well have serious doubts about her , and the truth was , she would n't blame him . " Things are shaky . " Johnny glanced over at Bobby . " Donald has sort of a drinking problem . " " Donald ! " Teri cried . " What about Mom ? " " She 's cutting back . " Johnny had always been quick to defend their mother . Donald had showed promise in the beginning . Apparently he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , they 'd quickly gone from supporting each other in sobriety to becoming drinking buddies . Neither of them could hold a job for long . How they survived financially , Teri did n't know . She had no intention of assisting them the way she did Johnny . It went without saying that any money she gave them would immediately go toward another bottle of booze or another night at their local bar . Crossing her arms , Teri leaned against the kitchen counter . " Mom 's cutting back ? Yeah , right . " " Even so , you should have Christie over to meet Bobby . " He turned toward him . " Christie 's our sister . " " Why did n't you tell me you have a sister ? " Bobby asked . He seemed perplexed that Teri had never mentioned Christie . He knew about her , of course , because he 'd had Teri 's background checked-a fact he 'd revealed in his usual dispassionate way . She had her reasons for not mentioning her younger sister and Johnny knew it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk to me about Christie , okay ? " " What is it with you and her ? " Johnny grumbled . " You 're too young to understand all the details , " she said , brushing aside his question . She and Christie were , for all intents and purposes , estranged , although Teri maintained a superficial civility on public occasions . " Come on , Ter , you and Bobby are married . He should meet the family . " " I do n't think so . " " You do n't want me to meet your family ? " Bobby gazed up at her with a hurt expression . He did n't realize that this conversation had nothing to do with him and everything to do with her mother and sister . " Yes , I do.someday . " She gently patted Bobby 's arm . " I thought we 'd get settled in the house before I invited them . " " We are settled . " Bobby gestured around him at the gleaming appliances and polished oak floors . " Not that settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was thinking four or five years-longer if she could get away with it . " Mom and Christie would really like to meet Bobby , " Johnny said again . Now Teri understood why her younger brother had shown up at the house unannounced . He 'd been sent as an emissary by their mother and Christie . His mission was to pave the way for an introduction to the rich and famous Bobby Polgar , who 'd been foolish enough to marry her . " They 'll have to meet him sooner or later , " Johnny said with perfect logic . " You ca n't avoid it forever , you know . " " I know . " Teri released a slow sigh . " Might as well be now . " Teri could see that she was n't going to escape the dreaded family gathering , so she 'd simply take Johnny 's advice . " Okay , okay , I 'll have everyone over for dinner . " " Great . " Johnny gave her a wide grin . " I 'll regret it afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Bobby asked , obviously still perplexed by her reaction . She hardly knew how to explain . " Are your mother and sister like you ? " " No way ! " Teri had done everything possible to make choices that did n't resemble theirs-with only partial success . While it was true that she never drank to excess , she 'd made more than one mistake in the relationship department . Until she met Bobby . " I 'll like them , wo n't I ? " Bobby asked next , smiling at her with childlike faith . She responded with a noncommital shrug . Her mother and sister were similar to each other in their behavior and their loser attitudes , although Teri did n't think Christie had a drinking problem so much as a man problem . Put a man in front of her , any man , and she could n't resist . " Is Christie still with . " For the life of her , she could n't remember the last man her sister had been living with . " Charlie , " Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's the one before Charlie , " her brother said . " And no , Charlie dumped her last month . " Oh , great . That meant her sister was on the prowl . This scenario could n't get much worse . " Christie will make a play for Bobby , " she said . Johnny shook his head firmly . " No , she won't.You two are married . " " Why would that stop her ? It has n't before . Trust me , she 'll make a play- " " Christie likes chess ? " Bobby interrupted excitedly . Clearly he did n't grasp the exchange going on between Teri and her brother . " No , Bobby . But my sister will think you 're the most brilliant , handsomest man in the world . " Bobby grinned . " Like you do . " Despite her agitation , Teri nodded . " Only more so , " she said grimly . " You 're jealous , " Johnny accused her . " Not Teri , " Bobby said , getting up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teri wrapped her arms around Bobby and hugged him close . " Thank you , " she whispered . " For what ? " " For loving me . " " That 's easy , " Bobby assured her . " Listen , you two lovebirds , I wish I could stay but I 've got to get back . I have a research paper that 's due tomorrow . " With Teri 's encouragement , Johnny was taking a summer course to get a head start on the next school year . He pushed back his chair and stood . " So you 'll get in touch with Mom ? " " I suppose . " Teri sighed , already resigned to the inevitable . " Christie , too , " her brother insisted . " She is our sister . " " Mark my words . Bobby wo n't be safe with her around . " And neither will my marriage , she thought darkly . Teri hated to disparage their sister . But experience told her exactly what to expect . Sure as anything , Christie would throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't matter . Not to Christie . Every boyfriend Teri 'd ever had , her sister had attempted to seduce . Bobby would n't be the exception , and because he was her husband , Christie would probably consider him an especially worthwhile challenge . Poor Bobby . He had no idea . He 'd certainly never encountered a family like hers . " Next weekend ? " Johnny asked hopefully . " No , " Teri said . She needed time to prepare herself for this . " Give me a week to get organized . Two weeks from Saturday . " If Johnny was disappointed by the delay , it did n't show . " See you then , " he said and kissed her cheek on his way out the door . Bobby slid his arm around her shoulders . Teri reminded herself yet again that she loved her husband and he loved her . Despite that , she could n't entirely quell her fears . While Bobby Polgar was unlike any man she 'd ever known , he was still a man . He 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm as every other boyfriend she 'd had . " I 'm happy to be meeting your family , " Bobby said after Johnny had left . Smiling proved difficult . Poor Bobby , she thought again . He did n't know what he was letting himself in for .
