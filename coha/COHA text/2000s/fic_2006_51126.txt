The Goth Squad <p> " About half of teenage goths have deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide , a new study suggests . But joining the modern subculture - which grew out of the 1980s gothic rock scene - may actually protect vulnerable children , researchers say . " - " Goth subculture may protect vulnerable children , " New Scientist , 14 April 2006 . SO A BUNCH of us were just coming out of the hot Topic store at the Edgar Allan Poe Mail when we bumped into those creepy new kids , Tanith , Poppy , and Storm . Now , I do n't care how many times you get held back in junior high , there 's no way you 're going to look as old as these three , even when you 're a senior . All the white face makeup and eyeshadow and black lipstick in the world - and these " girls " wore at least half of that amount-could n't conceal the fact that they were all at least as old as my Mom . Poppy seemed to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Poppy was at least in her twenties . Yet the principal had introduced them a week ago in a special assembly as " transfer students . " Dressed totally Goth , like three leather-strapped and metal-studded ravens , they were as fake as Michael Jackson 's nose . But none of us could figure out why they had been sent to our school . They did n't try to nark any students out or entrap us in Columbine-type schemes . All they 'd done so far was set up MySpace pages where they raved about Marilyn Manson and begged us to be their friends . Weird . So we mostly just ignored them . But now , here , away from the halls of Ligeia High School , it was gon na be kinda hard to pretend they did n't exist . Especially when Tanith called out to me like we were best buds . " Drew ! It 's so spectacularly tragic to see you ! Are you checking out the Goth stuff in this store ? It 's the best ! Have you seen those Demonia Metal Plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Courtney and Britncy clumped protectively up behind me like a wall I could rely on for support . I looked down my nose at Tanith . " I 'm sorry , I do n't go for that kind of fashion . I was looking for a new Green Day hoodie . " Tanith made a face . " Those guys are okay , I guess . But would n't you rather have one of those Slipknot or Ed Gein or Edward Scissorhands tops ? " " Eeeyeuw ! Gross ! How can you guys like that morbid stuff ? " Poppy said , " It 's not morbid - not if you look at it right . Death is a part of life . Pain and suffering can be beautiful too . " " Not that you actually have to indulge in such things , " Storm kicked in . " But it does n't hurt to look at what scares you . " " That 's how you gain power over it , " Tanith added . I rolled my eyes . " What-ever ! " Lacey , Courtney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to follow . " Where are you girls going ? " asked Tanith . " To the food court . " " Can we come too ? " I shrugged . " It 's a free mall . " After we got our food - pizza and tacos and fries - me and my friends took up one table while Tanith , Poppy , and Storm sat down next to us at another . The old Goths made a point of eating black licorice and black jelly beans and drinking green stuff they called " absinthe " out of a hip flask , like that was supposed to tempt us away from our deliciously greasy treats . The four of us tore into boys and music and TV shows , while the three ravens hovered on the edges of our conversation , looking for a way in . Lacey was talking about a Weezer concert she had gone to when the Coths found an opening . " So I was in line for T-shirts and this bitch cuts right in front of me - " Poppy leaned across the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you girls ever cut yourself ? " We all stared at the Coths like they still thought Uggs were hip this season . After a while I said , " What can you possibly be talking about ? " Storm said , " You know , using a razor blade or even your fingernails on your own skin , so the pain covers up your bad feelings . " " There 's no shame in doing it , " said Tanith . " But we can show you how you do n't even have to . " " Listen , " I said , " when I feel crappy I just eat a whole pint of Cherry Garcia - " But the Goths were n't listening to me or my friends at all . Instead , they plowed ahead into this mammoth discussion of all things Goth . There was no chance for us to break away , and we missed out on hooking up with tons of cute guys passing by , who avoided the Goths like the plague . For the next hour we had to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and music and fashion , how great the whole lifestyle was . Laurell Hamilton , Trent Reznor , Tim Burton-you 'd think they were God 's gift to teenagers . Goths were a community , a philosophy , a refuge from the uncaring modern society . When you were a Goth , you were never alone . Goths had the answer to everything . The whole one-sided discussion was more boring than Ms. Tanner 's physics class . I felt myself nodding off several times . But at last the three women ran out of canned talk . They all looked at us hopefully . " So , " Tanith said , " doyougirls think you might join us ? " " As Goths ? " " Sure . " " Not , " I said , " if being a Goth meant that I would never have another zit or gain another unwanted pound or have to take another test . Not if being a Goth meant I would get into the college of my choice totally free . Not if being a Goth meant I would win American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh-huh . " " Me too . " " What she said . " The Goths collapsed like balloons that had lost all their air . " Thatdoesit , " saidStorm . " This is useless . I 'm turning in my corset . " " Right behind you , girl , " said Poppy . " No , you ca n't give up now- " Tanith begged her partners . Now that they were n't pretending anymore , I decided to ask the Goths outright what they were doing . Tanith looked at me with a glimmer of hope . " As you might 've guessed , we 're not really students- " " Well , duh ! " " We 're part of a new government outreach program . It 's been scientifically determined that the Goth subculture can serve as a protective support structure for teens at risk . So we 've been commissioned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to go undercover and recruit young adults into it . But it 's not as easy as I first imagined it would be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts the ninth grade , they 're already totally set on their future path . ) ock , stoner , punk , granola , brainiac - You 're locked in tight . You 're not gon na have any luck with conversions at our age . " The Goths put their heads together then and began whispering . Me and my friends got up and redid our lipstick and got ready to go . " One minute , " Tanith called out . " We need your advice . " " Sure . What 's the question ? " " Would you have joined the Girl Scouts when you were younger if the uniforms were all black ? "
