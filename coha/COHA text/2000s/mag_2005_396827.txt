AN AMATEUR ARCHAEOLOGIST DISCOVERS THE FIELD WHERE WILY GERMANIC WARRIORS HALTED THE SPREAD OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE <p> " THIS THE SOIL OF 2,000 YEARS AGO , where we are standing now , " Susanne Wilbers-Rost was saying as a young volunteer pried a small , dark clod out of it . Wilbers-Rost , a specialist in early German archaeology , peered through wire-rimmed glasses , brushed away some earth , and handed an object to me . " You 're holding a nail from a Roman soldier 's sandal , " she said . A trim , short-haired woman , Wilbers-Rost has worked at the site , which is ten miles north of the manufacturing city of Osnabrck , Germany , since 1990 . Inch by inch , several young archaeologists under her direction are bringing to light a battlefield that was lost for almost 2,000 years , until an off-duty British Army officer stumbled across it in 1987 . <p> The sandal nail was a minor discovery , extracted from the soil beneath an overgrown pasture at the base of Kalkriese ( the word may derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill in an area where uplands slope down to the north German plain . But it was further proof that one of the pivotal events in European history took place here : in A.D. 9 , three crack legions of Rome 's army were caught in an ambush and annihilated . Ongoing finds  --  ranging from simple nails to fragments of armor and the remains of fortifications  --  have verified the innovative guerrilla tactics that according to accounts from the period , neutralized the Romans ' superior weaponry and discipline . <p> It was a defeat so catastrophic that it threatened the survival of Rome itself and halted the empire 's conquest of Germany . " This was a battle that changed the course of history , " says Peter S. Wells , a specialist in Iron Age European archaeology at the University of Minnesota and the author of The Battle That Stopped Rome . " It was one of the most devastating defeats ever suffered by the Roman Army , and its consequences were the most far-reaching . The battle led to the creation of a militarized frontier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it created a boundary between Germanic and Latin cultures that lasted 2,000 years . " Had Rome not been defeated , says historian Herbert W. Benario , emeritus professor of classics at Emory University , a very different Europe would have emerged . " Almost all of modern Germany as well as much of the present-day Czech Republic would have come under Roman rule . All Europe west of the Elbe might well have remained Roman Catholic ; Germans would be speaking a Romance language ; the Thirty Years ' War might never have occurred , and the long , bitter conflict between the French and the Germans might never have taken place . " <p> FOUNDED ( at least according to legend ) in 753 B.C. , Rome spent its formative decades as little more than an overgrown village . But within a few hundred years , Rome had conquered much of the Italian peninsula , and by 146 B.C. , had leapt into the ranks of major powers by defeating Carthage , which controlled much of the western Mediterranean . By the beginning of the Christian Era , Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the North Sea to the Sahara . The imperial navy had turned the Mediterranean into a Roman lake , and everywhere around the rim of the empire , Rome 's defeated enemies feared her legions  --  or so it seemed to optimistic Romans . " Germania " ( the name referred originally to a particular tribe along the Rhine ) , meanwhile , did not exist as a nation at all . Various Teutonic tribes lay scattered across a vast wilderness that reached from present-day Holland to Poland . The Romans knew little of this densely forested territory governed by fiercely independent chieftains . They would pay dearly for their ignorance . <p> There are many reasons , according to ancient historians , that the imperial Roman legate Publius Quinctilius Varus set out so confidently that September in A.D. 9 . He led an estimated 15,000 seasoned legionnaires from their summer quarters on the Weser River , in what is now northwestern Germany , west toward permanent bases near the Rhine . They were planning to investigate reports of an uprising among local tribes . Varus , 55 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Emperor Augustus ' representative in the province of Syria ( which included modem Lebanon and Israel ) , where he had quelled ethnic disturbances . To Augustus , he must have seemed just the man to bring Roman civilization to the " barbarous " tribes of Germany . <p> Like his patrons in Rome , Varus thought occupying Germany would be easy " Varus was a very good administrator , but he was not a soldier , " says Benario . " To send him out into an unconquered land and tell him to make a province of it was a huge blunder on Augustus ' part . " <p> Rome 's imperial future was by no means foreordained . At age 35 , Augustus , the first emperor , still styled himself " first citizen " in deference to lingering democratic sensibilities of the fallen Roman Republic , whose demise  --  after the assassination of Caesar  --  had brought him to power in 27 B.C. , following a century of bloody civil wars . During Augustus ' rule , Rome had grown into the largest city in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The German frontier held a deep allure for Augustus , who regarded the warring tribes east of the Rhine as little more than savages ripe for conquest . Between 6 B.C .. and A.D. 4 , Roman legions had mounted repeated incursions into the tribal lands , eventually establishing a chain of bases on the Lippe and Weser rivers . In time , despite growing resentment of the Roman presence , the tribes exchanged iron , cattle , slaves and foodstuffs for Roman gold and silver coins and luxury goods . Some tribes even pledged allegiance to Rome ; German mercenaries served with Roman armies as far away as the present-day Czech Republic . <p> One such German soldier of fortune , a 25-year-old prince of the Cherusci tribe , was known to the Romans as Arminius . ( His tribal name has been lost to history . ) He spoke Latin and was familiar with Roman tactics , the kind of man the Romans relied on to help their armies penetrate the lands of the barbarians . For his valor on the field of battle , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman citizenship . On that September day , he and his mounted auxiliaries were deputized to march ahead and rally some of his own tribesmen to help in putting down the rebellion . <p> Arminius ' motives are obscure , but most historians believe he had long harbored dreams of becoming king of his tribe . To achieve his goal , he concocted a brilliant deception : he would report a fictitious " uprising " in territory unfamiliar to the Romans , then lead them into a deadly trap . A rival chieftain , Segestes , repeatedly warned Varus that Arminius was a traitor , but Varus ignored him . " The Romans , " says Wells , " thought they were invincible . " <p> ARMINIUS HAD INSTRUCTED the Romans to make what he had described as a short detour , a one- or two-day march , into the territory of the rebels . The legionnaires followed along rudimentary trails that meandered among the Germans ' farmsteads , scattered fields , pastures , bogs and oak forests . As they progressed , the line of Roman troops  --  already seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers and a train of baggage carts pulled by mules  --  became dangerously extended . The legionnaires , wrote third-century historian Cassius Dio , " were having a hard time of it , felling trees , building roads , and bridging places that required it .... Meanwhile , a violent rain and wind came up that separated them still further , while the ground , that had become slippery around the roots and logs , made walking very treacherous for them , and the tops of the trees kept breaking off and falling down , causing much confusion . While the Romans were in such difficulties , the barbarians suddenly surrounded them on all sides at once , " Dio writes of the preliminary German skirmishes . " At first they hurled their volleys from a distance ; then , as no one defended himself and many were wounded , they approached closer to them . " Somehow , the command to attack had gone out to the German tribes . " This is pure conjecture , " says Benario , " but Arminius must have delivered a message that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman base lay at Haltern , 60 miles to the southwest . So Varus , on the second day , pressed on doggedly in that direction . On the third day , he and his troops were entering a passage between a hill and a huge swamp known as the Great Bog that , in places , was no more than 60 feet wide . As the increasingly chaotic and panicky mass of legionnaires , cavalrymen , mules and carts inched forward , Germans appeared from behind trees and sand-mound barriers , cutting off all possibility of retreat . " In open country , the superbly drilled and disciplined Romans would surely have prevailed , " says Wells . " But here , with no room to maneuver , exhausted after days of hit-and-run attacks , unnerved , they were at a crippling disadvantage . " <p> Varus understood that there was no escape . Rather than face certain torture at the hands of the Germans , he chose suicide , falling on his sword as Roman tradition prescribed . Most of his commanders followed suit , leaving their troops leaderless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army unexcelled in bravery , the first of Roman armies in discipline , in energy , and in experience in the field , through the negligence of its general , the perfidy of the enemy , and the unkindness of fortune .... was exterminated almost to a man by the very enemy whom it has always slaughtered like cattle , " according to the A.D. 30 account of Velleius Paterculus , a retired military officer who may have known both Varus and Arminius . <p> Only a handful of survivors managed somehow to escape into the forest and make their way to safety . The news they brought home so shocked the Romans that many ascribed it to supernatural causes , claiming a statue of the goddess Victory had ominously reversed direction . The historian Suetonius , writing a century after the battle , asserted that the defeat " nearly wrecked the empire . " Roman writers , says Wells , " were baffled by the disaster . " Though they blamed the hapless Varus , or the treachery of Arminius , or the wild landscape , in reality , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Romans thought . They were an informed , dynamic , rapidly changing people , who practiced complex farming , fought in organized military units , and communicated with each other across very great distances . " <p> More than 10 percent of the entire imperial army had been wiped out  --  the myth of its invincibility shattered . In the wake of the debacle , Roman bases in Germany were hastily abandoned . Augustus , dreading that Arminius would march on Rome , expelled all Germans and Gauls from the city and put security forces on alert against insurrections . <p> SIX YEARS WOULD PASS before a Roman army would return to the battle site . The scene the soldiers found was horrific . Heaped across the field at Kalkriese lay the whitening bones of dead men and animals , amid fragments of their shattered weapons . In nearby groves they found " barbarous altars " upon which the Germans had sacrificed the legioinnaires who surrendered . Human heads were nailed everywhere to trees . In grief and anger , the aptly named Germanicus , the Roman general leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the words of Tacitus , " not a soldier knowing whether he was interring the relics of a relative or a stranger , but looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood , while their wrath rose higher than ever against the foe . " <p> Germanicus , ordered to campaign against the Cherusci , still under the command of Arminius , pursued the tribe deep into Germany . But the wily chieftain retreated into the forests , until , after a series of bloody but indecisive clashes , Germanicus fell back to the Rhine , defeated . Arminius was " the liberator of Germany , " Tacitus wrote , " a man who , . . . threw down the challenge to the Roman nation . " <p> For a time , tribes flocked to join Arminius ' growing coalition . But as his power grew , jealous rivals began to defect from his cause . He " fell by the treachery of his relatives , " Tacitus records , in A.D. 21 . <p> With the abdication of the Romans from Germany , the Kalkriese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded the debacle were lost , sometime after the fifth century , during the collapse of the empire under the onslaught of barbarian invasions . But in the 1400s , humanist scholars in Germany rediscovered the works of Tacitus , including his account of Varus ' defeat . As a consequence , Arminius was hailed as the first national hero of Germany " The myth of Arminius , " says Benario , " helped give Germans their first sense that there had been a German people that transcended the hundreds of small duchies that filled the political landscape of the time . " By 1530 , even Martin Luther praised the ancient German chieftain as a " war leader " ( and updated his name to " Hermann " ) . Three centuries later , Heinrich von Kleist 's 1809 play , Hermann 's Battle , invoked the hero 's exploits to encourage his countrymen to fight Napoleon and his invading armies . By 1875 , as German militarism surged , Hermann had been embraced as the nation 's paramount historical symbol ; a titanic copper statue of the ancient warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menacingly toward France , was erected on a mountaintop 20 miles south of Kalkriese , near Detmold , where many scholars then believed the battle took place . At 87 feet high , and mounted on an 88-foot stone base , it was the largest statue in the world until the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886 . Not surprisingly , the monument became a popular destination for Nazi pilgrimages during the 1930s . But the actual location of the battle remained a mystery More than 700 sites , ranging from the Netherlands to eastern Germany , were proposed . <p> AMATEUR ARCHAEOLOGIST TONY CLUNN of Britain 's Royal Tank Regiment was hoping for a chance to indulge his interest when he arrived at his new posting in Osnabrck in the spring of 1987 . ( He had previously assisted archaeologists in England during his spare time , using a metal detector to search for traces of Roman roads . ) Captain Clunn introduced himself to the director of the Osnabrck museum , Wolfgang Schlter , and asked him for guidance . The British officer promised to turn over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , all I had ever hoped to find was the odd Roman coin or artifact , " Clunn , who retired from the army with the rank of major in 1996 , told me , as we sat drinking tea in a caf next to the Varusschlacht ( Varus Battle ) Museum and Park Kalkriese , which opened in 2002 . Schlter had suggested that he try the rural Kalkriese area , where a few coins had already been found . Clunn planned his assault with a soldier 's eye to detail . He pored over old maps , studied regional topography and read extensively about the battle , including a treatise by 19th-century historian Theodor Mommsen , who had speculated that it took place somewhere near Kalkriese , although few agreed with him . <p> As Clunn drove around Kalkriese in his black Ford Scorpio , introducing himself to local farmers , he saw a landscape that had changed significantly since Roman times . Forests of oak , alder and beech had long since given way to cultivated fields and copses of pine . Stolid modern farm buildings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient tribesmen . The Great Bog itself had disappeared , drained in the 19th century ; it was now bucolic pastureland . <p> Using an old hand-drawn map he got from a local landowner , Clunn noted the locations of earlier coin finds . " The secret is to look for the easy route that people would have taken in ancient times , " he says . " No one wants to dig a lot of unnecessary holes in the ground . So you look for the most logical spot to start searching  --  for example , a pass where a trail might narrow , a bottleneck . " Clunn focused on the area between where the Great Bog had been and Kalkriese Hill . As he walked , sweeping his metal detector from side to side , he noticed a slight elevation . " I sensed it was an old trackway , perhaps a path across the bog , " he says . He began following the elevation , working backward toward the hills . <p> Before long , a ringing in his earphones indicated metal in the earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turf with a trowel , and began to dig , sifting the peaty soil through his fingers . He dug down about eight inches . " Then I saw it ! " Clunn exclaims . In his hand lay a small , round silver coin , blackened with age  --  a Roman denarius , stamped on one side with the aquiline features of Augustus , and on the other , with two warriors armed with battle shields and spears . " I could scarcely believe it , " he says . " I was transfixed . " Soon he found a second denarius , then a third . Who lost these ? he asked himself , and what had the coin carrier been doing  --  running , riding , walking ? Before Clunn left the area for the day , he carefully logged the location of the coins on his grid map , sealed them in plastic pouches and restored the clods of dirt . <p> The next time Clunn returned to Kalkriese , his metal detector signaled another find : at a depth of about a foot , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a likeness of Augustus on one side , and on the other , a bull with head lowered , as if about to charge . By the end of the day , Chinn had unearthed no fewer than 89 coins . The following weekend , he found still more , for a total of 105 , none minted later than the reign of Augustus . The vast majority were in pristine condition , as if they had been little circulated when they were lost . <p> IN THE MONTHS that followed , Clunn continued his explorations , always turning over his finds to Schlter . Along with coins , he discovered shards of lead and bronze , nails , fragments of a groma ( a distinctive Roman road-surveying device ) and three curious ovoid pieces of lead that German scholars identified as sling shot . " Slowly but surely a cohesive pattern began to emerge , " says Clunn . " There was every indication that a large contingent of people had splayed out from the area at the apex to the field , fleeing from an unknown horror . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of Varus ' lost legions . <p> Thanks to Schlter 's contacts in German academia , the site was recognized , almost immediately , as a major discovery . Professional archaeologists under the direction of Schlter and , later , Wilbers-Rost undertook systematic excavations . They were fortunate : sometime in the past , local farmers had covered the poor sandy subsoil with a thick layer of sod that had protected the undiscovered artifacts below . <p> Since the early 1990s , excavations have located battle debris along a corridor almost 15 miles long from east to west , and a little more than 1 mile from north to south , offering additional proof that it unfolded over many miles , before reaching its dreadful climax at Kalkriese . <p> Perhaps the most important single discovery was evidence of a wall 4 feet high and 12 feet thick , built of sand and reinforced by chunks of sod . " Arminius learned much from his service with the Romans , " says Wilbers-Rost . " He knew their tactics and their weak points . The wall zigzagged so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two angles . They could stand on the wall , or rush out through gaps in it to attack the Roman flank , and then run back behind it for safety . " Concentrations of artifacts were found in front of the wall , suggesting that the Romans had tried to scale it . The dearth of objects behind it testifies to their failure to do so . <p> The more the archaeologists excavated , the more they appreciated the immensity of the massacre . Clearly , Arminius and his men had scoured the battlefield after the slaughter and carried off everything of value , including Roman armor , helmets , gold and silver , utensils and weapons . Most of what archaeologists have unearthed consists of items the victors failed to notice , or dropped as they looted . Still , there have been some spectacular finds , including the remnants of a Roman officer 's scabbard and , most notably , a Roman standard-bearer 's magnificent silver face mask . They also uncovered coins stamped with the letters " VAR , " for Varus , which the ill-fated commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , Wilbers-Rost 's team has found more than 5,000 objects : human bones ( including several skulls gruesomely split by swords ) , spearheads , bits of iron , harness rings , metal studs , pieces of armor , iron nails , tent pegs , scissors , bells that once hung from the necks of Roman mules , a wine strainer and medical instruments . Many of these objects , cleaned and restored , are on display in the museum at the site . ( Archaeologists also found fragments of bombs that Allied planes dropped on the area during World War II ) . <p> CLUNN , NOW 59 , still works , as a staff officer , for the British military in Osnabrck . One recent afternoon , amid intermittent cloudbursts , he and I drove east from Kalkriese along the route that Varus ' army most likely followed on the last day of its harrowing march . We stopped at a low hill on the outskirts of the village of Schwagstorf . From the car , I could barely detect the rise in the ground , but Clunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity . " It 's the only place that offers any natural defense , " he said . Here , he has found the same types of coins and artifacts that have been unearthed at Kalkriese ; he hopes that future excavations will determine that the battered Roman forces attempted to regroup here shortly before they met their doom . As we stood at the edge of a traffic circle and gazed across a cornfield , he added : " I 'm convinced that this is the site of Varus ' last camp .
