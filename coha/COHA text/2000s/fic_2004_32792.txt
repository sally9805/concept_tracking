Chapter One The humpback whale cruised slowly northward through the blue waters of the eastern Atlantis Ocean , listening to the sounds of the sea around him . Sound carries far under water , depending upon its frequency . The humpback did not use sonar , but used the sounds created by other sea creatures large and small , to create a three dimensional map of its surroundings that stretched , with decreasing accuracy , for a bubble hundreds of miles around . To the southwest were several schools of fish . Birds were diving on them and tuna were working over one while a school of spiny sharks was attacking another . To the northwest , by the lands of ice , a pod of fellow humpbacks , the ocean 's great communicators , were giving their siren calls , imbedding in them a constant litany of information . A school of squid was in the deeps below the humpback , but he was neither a pelagic hunter like the sei and blues , to go after the schools to the south , nor a deep hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could make the five hundred meters down to the shoal . No , he was an inshore hunter , who could gorge on herring for a few weeks and then survive for months on the stored fat . So Bruno told himself . But he was still hungry and the resupply ships were n't due for another two weeks . As he was mentally grumblingto himself , and turning to the east to stay inside his patrol zone , he picked up the frantic squealing of delphino . He listened and then continued his slow and lazy turn until he was pointed in the direction of the distant pod just sculling along a hundred meters below the surface where the interference from the surface chop dropped off . The sound was attenuated by the distance , the high-frequency pinging of the delphinos dropped off rapidly even in cold water , but the humpbacks were not merely the loudest whales in the ocean , they had the best hearing . He waited until the sound began to shift and then surfaced , blasting out the air he had held in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cold north Atlantis air . He then dropped back to a hundred meters , turned tail up and began to let out a deep series of throbs , like deep , giant drumbeats that resounded through the ocean . * * * The mer was lying in mud , his hands interlaced behind his head to keep it up out of the glutinous black mass . Asfaw did n't like sitting in mud , but the alternative was swimming back and forth and that got old quick . He thought to himself , as he had at least a hundred times , that he ought to do something about there being nothing but mud down here . But then he reminded himself that writing memos was a pain in the tail and probably nothing would be done anyway ; support of the mer was a pretty low priority around here as their quarters proved . So he continued sitting in the mud , lying in the mud and occasionally playing with the mud through the long watches . As he was contemplating , again , that he 'd much rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouts , he sat up and cocked his head to the side . He listened for a moment then blanched , his fair skin turning fairer in the dark waters . He quickly swam to the surface and took a breath of air , using it to blast the water in his lungs out through the gill-slits in his ribcage . There was n't anyone on the floating dock so he swam over to the ladder and climbed up it , hand over hand , until he could see over the side of the dock . The messenger was sitting on a chair , see , he at least had a chair , his head bowed on his chest . The moon had set but lantern light was more than enough to see that he was slightly drooling and twitching in his sleep . " Robertson ! " the mer snapped . " Wake up ! " " Whah ? " the messenger said , sitting up and looking around blearily . " Wake up and get ready to take a message , " the mer said . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil lamp on his table and fumbling out writing materials and instruments . " When you 've delivered the message , go wake up the rest of the messengers ; we 're going to have a busy day . " " Yes , sir , " the messenger repeated . As the mer dictated , the pen of the messenger trembled and his face , too , turned stark white in the red lamplight. * * * " As you can see , " the young man said , drawing another line on the chalkboard . " Subedei used indirect methods in each of his campaigns . And in each of his major battles , although often heavily outnumbered by equally trained forces , he was able to overcome them by destroying their will to fight or their means . " The instructor was , if anything , younger than most of his students , which were a young crowd . He was barely twenty , but eyes were cold and old and his hard face was lined with scars , as was the hand that wielded the chalk . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was currently hooked in the belt of his undress uniform , a gray kimonolike tunic with an undershirt of unbleached cosilk , a heavy cosilk scarf wrapped around his neck and tucked into the tunic , blue pants with a light blue seam down the trouser-leg and heavy , rough-leather boots . The uniform was somewhat faded with use and washings and the boots had seen heavy use too . But it was clearly comfortable wear to the young man , clothes that he had worn for enough days and years to consider them normal wear . Besides being young , he was also a large man . Very large . The chalk looked like a stubby twig in his hand . " Now , " he said , turning to the class that was rapidly trying to repeat his sketches . " Can anyone tell me of a strategic use of the indirect approach ? " " The latter United States battles against the Soviet Union ? " one of the women at the back of the room said , not looking up from her sketch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And can you give me another example from the same time period ? " The young woman looked up in startlement at that and shook her head . " The War on Terrorism ? " one of the males asked . " Yes , " the instructor replied . " At no point in either war did the U.S. directly attack those countries which were the most dangerous to them , politically and strategically , through the use of terrorism . Instead , it attacked the countries that aided and supported them in their cultural memes or directly assaulted those memes . By destroying the economy of the Soviet Union in the first case , and by destroying the cultural , not to mention financial , support of terrorism in the second , the U.S. in both cases destroyed an enemy that , arguably , was capable of winning the war . The Soviet Union by a direct nuclear strike , or a ground assault upon America 's allies , and the terrorist-sponsoring states through economic embargo or direct sponsorship of weapons of mass destruction terrorism . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked at the weakest point , winning vast wars with very small engagements . " " Iraq was not the weakest state in the region , " the female ensign said . " They had more forces than the expeditionary force could field against them for logistic reasons . " " Which EF used the indirect approach again , " the instructor pointed out . He wiped the preceding sketch from the board and started to draw another . " The enemy was in fixed , and very strong , positions , along the probable avenues of approach . Approaches that had been used , notably by the Briton allies of the Americans , in previous wars . By using movement through what the enemy thought was impassable ground , logistically , the Americans and their Briton allies forced the enemy into a battle of maneuver that it could not win against their air superiority . And then by placing forces in the region they drew off the majority of attacks against the civilians in the allied state of Israel as well as their home countries . " Again , Subedei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gates , created an environment the enemy believed could not be crossed , and then crossed it , crushing the superior Persian force in detail . They then put the entire region to the sword , which tended to prevent the sort of problems the Americans saw , but that was a different time . Slim used much the same approach in his battles along the Irriwady shore where he was facing a highly capable , proven dangerous enemy . One that had previously beaten him , badly , on the same terrain , I might add . " The young man laid down the chalk and wiped his hand on a rag held by the prosthetic . " One wonders if the generals of that time studied Subedei as well , " he added with a grin . " But ... " the female ensign said . " Yes , Ensign Van Krief ? " he said , mildly . " What happens if the enemy is smart enough to overcome your indirect approach ? " Amosis Van Krief asked . The ensign was just below medium height with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad , strongly muscled body . She also had bright blue eyes and very nice legs , which the instructor was careful not to comment upon or even appear to notice . " In that case , " the young man smiled lopsidedly , " you 'd better have one hell of a go-to-hell-plan . Because you only use this approach when you do n't have a choice ; when your forces are inferior or of parity . It 's always better , if you have a steam hammer , to crack the walnut that way . The problem is , you usually do n't have a steam hammer . Cracking the nut when you do n't appear to have the strength requires subtlety . " The door to the room opened softly and a young female private entered and popped to attention . " Captain Herrick , " she squeaked nervously , " the general wants to see you at ... at your ... " " Earliest convenience ? " the instructor asked with a slight grin , wiping his hands again . " Yes , sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , sir , " the private said , biting her lip , " Duke Talbot , sir . " The instructor paused and then turned on one heel to the fascinated ensigns . " Class , " he snapped . " Your assignment for tomorrow is to examine the Inchon landing and the Nipponese attack on Myanmar in the Axis-Allies War . Come up with at least three viable alternatives for each . Be prepared to defend your alternatives . Attention ! " He waited until the group had snapped to the position of attention then looked around at them . " What 's our motto , boys and girls ? " he sang out . " No plan survives contact with the enemy ! " the class shouted in unison . " And who are we ? " he asked . " THE ENEMY ! " " Dismissed . " With that he marched out of the room . * * * Megan " Sung " checked the level of liquid in her " waste " retort and shook her head . She had had enough material for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of the excess , but just kept building it up . She knew how to kill Paul , but she was n't sure what to do after that . Megan had been sixteen when an old traveler found the tall , lithe , pretty , if rather dirty and underfed , young brunette washing clothes by the side of a Ropasan stream . She had helped the old man across the river and the next thing she knew she was here , wherever " here " was , in the harem of Paul Bowman , head of the New Destiny faction of the Council of Key-holders . Things had initially been ... tough . The senior female in the harem was Christel Meazell , one of the women with whom Paul had had a child prior to the Fall . She was both in charge of making sure the girls understood their " duties " and managing the logistics of the harem . Since she had gotten very little education-prior to the Fall there was no strict need to learn to even write your name-managing the accounts associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all had to be done by hand and Christel could not get the same number twice in a row if she had to add two plus two . She had taken that frustration out on the girls and they had , in turn , passed it on . When Megan had arrived , conditions had been vicious . The girls knew better than to do permanent or disfiguring damage , but they took out their boredom and frustration in other ways , many of them sexual and all of them cruel . Megan had dealt with that aspect of the life rather quickly . Her father had trained her intensively in almost lost arts of self-defense ; he had seen protection fields fail from " personal " reasons too many times to fully trust them . But a blow to the gut was a blow to the gut . So the " new girl " had not been the soft touch the regulars had come to expect . She had kept the ability more or less secret , only pointing it out a couple of times to the " Alpha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under control , the rest did n't dare bother her . Managing Christel had been harder . But as soon as Megan showed that she was more than capable of doing the " logistic " end , Christel had turned the books over to her with an almost audible sigh of relief . Using that wedge Megan had slowly , more or less , taken over the harem . To the point that from time to time she even gave Christel orders . So that aspect of the life had gotten better . Recognizing that the biggest problem in the harem was boredom she had cajoled Christel into running exercise classes . These led to more structured learning in sewing , singing , musical instruments . Anything to pass the time and give the girls something to do other than bicker and play " practical jokes " on one another . She had taken control of that aspect of her life , but there was another over which she had no control . And that had taken a long time to ... improve . Megan had not been a virgin when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapes , and there was no other term , were not pleasant . But , over time , she had grown not only to accept them philosophically , but even to fall in love with her captor , horrible as that made her feel . Paul could be a very charming man and he was the only source of news of the outside available to them . Once Megan had , slowly , gotten over her initial revulsion she had grown , however much she hated it , to first liking Paul and then , strangely , haltingly , loving him . She was a strong-willed young lady , educated beyond ninety percent of her generation . She was the daughter of one of the few remaining police in the pre-Fall period . Under her father 's pressure , and later her own , she had used advanced technology training methods to become more educated than most human beings in history . She was an expert forensic chemist , was highly trained in self-defense , spoke three dead languages , could cook-another almost lost art-and could do calculus in her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of avocations . So it nearly drove her insane that she was " falling " for her captor . Eventually Paul , who had done research before setting up what he considered nothing more than a " breeding pool , " had explained that her reaction was anticipated . Captives who depended for their survival purely on the will of captors , who kept close and intimate contact , tended to bond to them . Not all ; there was one girl , Amber , who had fought the captivity until she was eventually brain drained and left as a willing semivegetable to Paul 's desires . But Megan , like most of the rest of the " girls " had come to know Paul , to bond to him and through that bonding to love him . But that did not mean she was n't going to kill him . As soon as she figured out how to do it and survive . What bothered her about the situation , other than being stuck in a harem , was that she now knew more of the inner workings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew their weaknesses , knew their strengths , which were many . She longed , dreamed , of getting the information out to the Freedom Coalition . But no matter how she pondered the problem , she could n't figure out a way to pass on the intelligence and survive . Among other things Paul had let slip in their many conversations was that he had a source very close to the Freedom Council . And escaping with the information would be difficult . The girls were kept in close confinement , a large compartment in a castle that had been converted to living quarters . There were only two entrances , both blocked by high-technology proscriptions . The walls were stone , which she could deal with , the same way she intended to " deal " with Paul when the time came . But even if the girls somehow made their way past those defenses they were surrounded by the guards of New Destiny , both Paul 's special guards , all of them highly trained fighters who were bound to him by Net-imposed loyalty proscriptions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Destiny 's army .
