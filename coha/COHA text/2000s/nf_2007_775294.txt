Excerpt The common wisdom about the saxophonist John Coltrane is that he was the last major figure in the evolution of jazz , that the momentum of jazz stalled , and nearly stopped , after his death at age forty in 1967. // What was the essence of Coltrane ? s achievement that makes him so prized forty years after his death ? Why have so many musicians and listeners been so powerfully drawn to him ? What was it about his improvising , his bands , his compositions , his place within his era of jazz ? What were the factors that helped Coltrane become who he was ? And what would a John Coltrane look like now , or are we wrong to be looking for such a figure ? // From the outside , one keeps wondering which musician will take the next decisively evolutionary step , as all those who seem to be candidates repeat themselves , become hermetic or obvious , fail to write compelling original material , sell out in some form , or begin to bore their audiences . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . It seems to be the case that jazz loops around , retrenches , makes tiny adjustments that don ? t alter the basic language . The problem , though , is that Coltrane certainly made it seem as if jazz were evolving . He barreled ahead , and others followed . Some are still following . // His career , especially the last ten years of it , was so unreasonably exceptional that when he became seen as the representative jazz musician , the general comprehension of how and why jazz works became changed ; it also became jagged and dangerous with half-truths . Every half-truth needs a full explanation . // This is not a book about Coltrane ? s life , but the story of his work . The first part tells the story of his music as it was made , from his first recordings as a no-name navy bandsman in 1946 until his death as a near-saint of jazz in 1967 . The second part tells the story of his influence , starting in his lifetime and continuing until today . The reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross over into the other ? s territory now and then  --  is because the work and its reception have had distinct , different , and individually logical lives . // This is a book about jazz as sound . I mean " sound " as it has long functioned among jazz players , as a mystical term of art : as in , every musician finally needs a sound , a full and sensible embodiment of his artistic personality , such that it can be heard , at best , in a single note . Miles Davis ? s was fragile and pointed . Coleman Hawkins ? s was ripe and mellow and generous . John Coltrane ? s was large and dry , slightly undercooked , and urgent . // But I also mean sound as a balanced block of music emanating from a whole band . How important is this ? With Coltrane , sound ruled over everything . It eventually superseded composition : his later records present one track after another of increasing similarity , in which the search for sound superseded solos and structure . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ballad , was the reason older musicians respected him so  --  his high-register sound , for example , in " Say It Over and Over Again . " But it was also the reason younger and less formally adept musicians were drawn to him , and why they could even find themselves a place on his bandstand. // Coltrane loved structure in music , and the science and theory of harmony ; one of the ways he is remembered is as the champion student of jazz . But insofar as Coltrane ? s music has some extraordinary properties  --  the power to make you change your consciousness a little bit  --  we ought to widen the focus beyond the constructs of his music , his compositions , and his intellectual conceits . Eventually we can come around to the music ? s overall sound : first how it feels in the ear and later how it feels in the memory , as mass and as metaphor . Musical structure , for instance , can ? t contain morality . But sound , somehow , can . Coltrane ? s large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that I ? m supposed to grow to the best good that I can get to . " // What Coltrane accomplished , and how he connected with audiences for jazz around the world , seems to elude any possible career plan , and is remarkably separate from what we have come to understand as European-based , Western-culture artistic consciousness . This book attempts to track the connections of his work  --  how and why he proceeded from A to B to Z  --  and then , later , to ask why Coltrane has weighed so heavily in the basic identity of jazz for the last half century . // Coltrane  --  whose music is marked by remarkable technique , strength in all registers of the tenor and soprano saxophones , slightly sharp intonation , serene intensity , and a rapid , mobile exploration of chords , not just melody  --  made jazz that was alternately seductive , mainstream , and antagonistic . Among his recordings were the high-speed harmonic ? tude " Giant Steps " ( 1959 ) ; the exotic , ancient-sounding modal versions of " My Favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 ) ; the headlong , sometimes discordant , fifteen-minute blues in F , " Chasin ? the Trane " ( 1961 ) ; the devotional suite A Love Supreme ( 1964 ) ; the mournful ballads " Soul Eyes " ( 1962 ) and " After the Rain " ( 1963 ) ; and the whirligig free-jazz duet performance with drums alone , Interstellar Space ( 1967 ) . // His work became unofficially annexed by the civil rights movement : its sound alone has become a metaphor for dignified perseverance . His art , nearly up to the end , was not insular , and kept signifying different things for different people of different cultures and races . His ugliest music ( to a certain way of thinking ) is widely suspected of possessing beauty beyond the listener ? s grasp , and the reverse goes for his prettiest music  --  that it is more properly understood as an expression of grave seriousness . There is more poetry written about him , I would guess , than about any other jazz musician . And his religious quests through Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ex post facto , in his music . In pluralistic America , it has become hard not to hear Coltrane ? s modal music  --  in which an improviser , freed from chordal movement , becomes free to explore  --  as a metaphor for a personal religious search . // Coltrane , particularly from 1961 to 1964 , sounds like the thing we know as modern jazz , just the way that Stravinsky sounds like the thing we know as modern classical music . Young bandleaders , especially saxophonists , find him a safe place , the safe place . Some musicians may disagree on the basis of their own experiences  --  jazz is hundreds of microclimates  --  but here it is : the sound of so many jazz gigs I ? ve heard in the past fifteen years , as a jazz critic in New York , is usually the sound of albums like Coltrane ? s Sound or Coltrane Plays the Blues , the Coltrane quartet just before or in the first stages of a modal-jazz style , just tightening , still before A Love Supreme and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be obvious . ( Not that it isn ? t sometimes borrowed from , and not that such borrowing isn ? t usually obvious to the point of vulgarity . ) He has been more widely imitated in jazz over the last fifty years than any other figure . // Some musicians have told me that after a period of immersion , they could not listen to him anymore . Listeners , too . I have played other kinds of music in bands , and studied with a jazz pianist , but I am a writer , not a jazz musician . When I first heard Coltrane ? s records as a teenager in the 1980s , the 1956 Prestige sessions with the Miles Davis Quintet  --  " Tune Up " and " If I Were a Bell " especially  --  he sounded to me like a great lake whose dimensions I knew I wanted to trace . Next was Giant Steps , with its brightness , concision , harmonic acuity , and strong original melodies . It did me no harm  --  not until later , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I reacted against . I wasn ? t alive in the early sixties , and perhaps for that reason The European Tour , a double-LP set of Coltrane ? s band recorded live in 1962 and 1963 , first seemed to me the stylization of modal music , a soft , snake-charming lob toward the progressive , self-congratulating audiences accruing around Coltrane after his radio hit , " My Favorite Things . " I rejected it , pretty much . // But when I got to Live at the Village Vanguard , particularly the track " Spiritual , " I developed a block against it . This music was no half-stepping : deep and correct and serious , harder and more violently swinging and slightly ancient-sounding , the intimations of Coltrane ? s modal style before it hardened as a gesture . This band was the supreme consortium of live jazz , the one most related to **30;428;TOOLONG . It seemed that you could go in there and not be able to find your way out . // I did have some sort of index for seriousness in jazz at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York that tried to be profound and occasionally was . The guitarist Sonny Sharrock and his loud band with two drummers made sense to me by its natural connections both to rock-and-roll and post-Coltrane free jazz - specifically to Pharoah Sanders ? s records of the late 1960s . The tenor saxophonist Charles Gayle and his trios played a kind of highly expressionistic collective improvisation , whose main factors were its manipulation of rhythmic chaos and the unpredictable charisma of Gayle himself . Another tenor player , David S. Ware , led a quartet which took the example of Coltrane in about 1965 to the next plane of loud-and-lugubrious ; it was all density . On the other hand , David Murray ? s trio with Wilber Morris and Andrew Cyrille was more spindly and playful and pretty , with nice original lines , and a completely different story from Coltrane ? s . ( Murray ? s allegiance was to melodic improvisation , the Sonny Rollins line of playing , as opposed to Coltrane ? s way of implying whole chords in his sweep. ) // But those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of density and noise without fetishizing it , and didn ? t stop there . Coltrane connected his own learned harmonic patterns with many outside approaches , picked up from other jazz musicians and various folk cultures  --  a thoroughly willed , nearly maniacal method of inclusion . And he built a groove with his bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones that grew stronger , even as the rest of the music became heavy with super-extended soloing , the overload of individual will . The various sounds of Live at the Village Vanguard became some of jazz ? s most revisited majority languages , connecting schools of players who would otherwise have little to do with each other , formalists and non-formalists. // Anyway , two years went by before I tried listening seriously to Coltrane again . Now it was twenty-eight years after Live at the Village Vanguard was recorded , and the bohemian interior of the jazz audience in New York had become , as far as I could see , smaller and more self-conscious . Jazz ? s early-sixties identity as protest material for Americans who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had since been celebrated , fetishized , and nostalgized ; since the beginning of the 1980s , the music-as-music had been studied as an academic subject . Jazz , too , had crept into pop and hiphop . And a jazz-classicism movement , which exercised withering skepticism toward most of the loose-form and nonacoustic music that had happened in jazz after the mid-sixties , had gained fully funded legitimacy through house orchestras at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall and the Smithsonian . // The point I am making is that there were so many entryways to jazz by 1989 that I didn ? t necessarily want to deal with the most serious , uncomfortable , and perhaps necessary way in : immersion in John Coltrane ? s recordings . Part of that discomfort came from the fact that it had become totally unclear how to think of them . They form a path , but was it a path toward a new language or nonsense ? // The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis , the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center , as well as his brothers Branford ( the saxophonist ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley Crouch  --  who wrote a great deal of combative opinions associated with them  --  had become extremely potent cultural commentators by that point . Wynton was in the business of selecting what was good and lasting across the entire history of jazz . Serving as faction boss , he talked persuasively about what had been watered down or lost in jazz : four-four swing , ballads , constructive competition , a sense of boundaries and exclusivity . He really loved to argue , and the gist of his arguments was always responsibility : whether you are doing good or harm to the music . ( And not just to jazz , but , by extension , to American culture . ) He talked about jazz as if it were a patient on a table . He prescribed the necessary measures musicians ought to be taking if they wanted jazz to survive at all . // Suddenly the life ? s work of Coltrane , and his gradual trajectory toward non-swing , non-ballads , non-competiveness , non-boundaried inclusion , could seem dangerous . But the fact remained that if you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spiritual , " or the rest of Live at the Village Vanguard , both sides of the argument seemed shallow , and imposed from without by parties with an agenda . A record like that one indicated that the common-room of jazz was also , paradoxically , its darkest and most mysterious place .
