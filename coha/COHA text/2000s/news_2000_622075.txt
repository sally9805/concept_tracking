<p> Amateur Jeff Wilson , who lives in Green Valley near Fairfield and works at a car dealership in Vallejo , played in the third group off the tee , encountering fog and wind near the end of his round yesterday . He bogeyed the 17th and 18th , dropping him to 3-over-par 74 . <p> " I wish I could have finished better , but I think it will be a decent score , " said Wilson , 37 , whose previous U.S. Open experience in 1982 and 1990 has taught him the value of being near par in an Open . <p> " The last four or five holes the wind and fog blew in  --  they played tough . At 17 , I hit a 3-iron into the cheap seats  --  well , I guess they 're not so cheap . The wind may have been a factor , but it was headed in that direction . " <p> Wilson , a former PGA Tour player who regained his amateur status a few years ago , was playing his first round of competitive medal play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 Vallejo City Championship , which he won . <p> Minitour pro Todd Fischer , 30 , of Pleasanton did not fare as well , returning a 7-over 78 , with a double-bogey 7 at the 14th . However , he did birdie the new 5th hole , which caused problems for many players . <p> Ricky Barnes , 19 , of Stockton , the Pac-10 freshman of the year at Arizona , was on the course when the fog delay was declared . <p> QUOTEABLE : " I still have no expectations . . . And I know that I have to play my A-plus game to have any chance of being in contention here . "  --  Bobby Clampett , who shot a 68 . <p> " It was out there to be had if you made some putts . But it 's tough to make some putts . It 's a little bumpy . But that 's Pebble Beach . I 'm not complaining . It 's just tough to make them . "  --  Rocco Mediate , on his 2-under 69 . <p> " You get good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over I 'm sure we 'll get a nasty day . "  --  Tom Lehman , after his first-round 71 . <p> " I think they were just trying to beat the traffic . "  --  PGA Tour pro Brent Geiberger , who shot a 73 , on the 50 or so people at the 1st tee when he teed off in the first threesome at 6:30 a.m . <p> PASSING TIME : Before the decision was made to call the players in from the course , most of them whiled away the down time yacking with fellow competitors , signing autographs for fans or schmoozing with the powers that be . <p> " We were speaking with USGA officials , discussing the rules of golf , " said Greg Norman , who was stranded on the 8th tee . " You do n't get that chance that often . " <p> Jack Nicklaus found another way to pass the time : feeding a group of starlings and seagulls that were visiting the 10th tee . <p> " I was eating a hot dog and I had too much bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the birds and had some fun with them . " <p> The gallery also ate it up . <p> STEWART MEMORIALS : Nicklaus made his own impromptu tribute to Payne Stewart yesterday : He took a short break on the first tee before beginning play . <p> " I was taking Payne 's place in the rotation for starting time , " he said , " so I had a moment in silence for that . . . . I thought it was the right thing to do . " <p> Nicklaus then put his drive into the rough , en route to a bogey 5 on the hole . <p> " I hit a bad tee shot , " he said . " I did n't expect that much emotion because of ( the tribute to Stewart ) . " <p> Meanwhile , Sergio Garcia wore knickers in honor of Stewart . Garcia shot a 4-over 75 . <p> LONG DAY : No one had a longer day yesterday than Tom Richardson . He spent nine hours camped in the starter 's tent at the 1st tee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not show up to play in the Open . <p> Richardson was the No. 3 alternate , and the first two got into the field because of player withdrawals earlier in the week . <p> " I got here early , " he said , " about 6 ( a half-hour before the first group began play ) . I ate breakfast , hit some balls , warmed up and told everybody I was here . " <p> And then he sat and waited . And waited some more . <p> " Every threesome showed up , " Richardson said . <p> Richardson is a young pro who lives in Denver and attended Colorado State . He failed the PGA qualifying school twice , missed qualifying for the Canadian tour by a shot and spends his time playing various state Opens and pro-ams . <p> In the Colorado sectional qualifier , Richardson was one of 24 players competing for two spots in the Open . He played 36 holes in 4-under , but two players did it in 6-under , leaving him out . He flew to California on Sunday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> NEED A TEE : Pro golfers usually have all the equipment they need . There 's even a bucket of tees at the starter 's tent just in case they need a few more . But yesterday , Fred Couples got up on the first tee , reached into his pocket for a ball and a tee  --  and only found the ball . He got a tee from another player  --  strictly legal under the rules . <p> FINISHING IN THE FOG : Long before play was suspended at 3:56 p.m. , the fog rolled in and turned several holes  --  especially Nos. 17 and 18  --  into blind adventures . <p> Phil Mickelson , who reached those holes about 1 p.m. , offered no complaints , even if the fog made his work treacherous . <p> " I thought it was cool , " Mickelson said . " I hit a 3-wood and I thought it was neat that you could barely see the tree ( in the middle of the fairway ) . You know what it felt like ? It was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the bagpipers playing at the memorial for Payne ( Stewart ) . " <p> Jesper Parnevik was playing in the group following Mickelson . Parnevik could barely see the green on the par-3 17th ; after hitting his tee shot , he peered into the distance , turned toward the gallery and shrugged his shoulders , drawing hearty laughter . <p> Parnevik probably was not laughing when he found his ball in the sand trap in front of the green . He then blasted out and made the putt to save par . <p> LONG LINES : This was not quite Pacific Bell Park-like , but the bathroom lines were long at many spots around Pebble Beach yesterday . Some lines stretched nearly 50 people deep . <p> At least the lines moved well . One fan waiting alongside the No. 8 fairway , Jon Goudreau of Stockton , said it took him about 10 minutes to reach the front of the line . <p> " I usually find there 's a correlation between this line and the beer line , " Goudreau said . <p> TIGER 'S BALL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-under 65 is his first round since formally switching to the Nike Tour Accuracy ball . <p> Woods tested the ball during a tournament in Germany , finishing third , and won the Memorial by five strokes when he used the ball again . Afterward , he announced he would go with the Nike Tour Accuracy for good , beginning at Pebble Beach . <p> The announcement ended a marketing conflict between Woods top two golf sponsors  --  Nike and Titleist  --  that began last year when Nike entered the ball market . <p> Most players would be reluctant to change equipment before a major tournament . Then again , Woods is not the normal player . <p> " I would have to say that would be a mistake under normal circumstances , " Colin Montgomerie told reporters . " Before you write that down , let me finish . The under normal circumstances ' was the bit I was trying to get at . I believe Tiger won the Memorial with that ball . Well , he 's tested it , has n't he ? " <p> OLLIE 'S COMEBACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this year 's U.S. Open . <p> The two-time Masters champion fired a 1-under 70 in the opening round , putting himself in position to make a run for another major title . <p> " The course is difficult , but I played quite well today , " said Olazabal . <p> Pat Sullivan , Ron Kroichick , Dan Giesin , and the Associated Press contributed to this report .
