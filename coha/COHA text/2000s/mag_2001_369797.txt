Dorothy Gallagher has written a piercingly funny book , and there 's not a joke in it . In the first chapter of How I Came Into My Inheritance and Other True Stories ( Random House ; 187 pages ; $22.95 ) , she drags us straight into the sick room from hell . She is looking after Bella and Izzy , her failing Russian-Jewish parents . She muddles through with such wryness and tenderness and , finally , wisdom that it will make you ache for another chance to tend your own parents . <P> It 's one thing to be our fathers ' and mothers ' keepers , another to get it right , quite another to be able to look back at the experience without flinching . Gallagher , 60 , says it took two years after her parents died in 1992 before she could go through the notes she had jotted down during her vigil . A writer by trade , she thought she might make one short piece of them . " But then I started typing , " she recalls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd found my voice , and then I had 150 pages . " That voice  --  unsentimental , breezy , blunt  --  never wavers as she takes us first to her parents ' deathbeds and then back to their earlier , happier years . <P> What makes this book different from some of the more sensational memoirs by less fond daughters is that it takes the ordinary , wrenching dilemma every child faces , peoples it with larger-than-life figures and sorts it all out . <P> In her parents ' final days , Gallagher made daily visits to the vacation house her father had built with his own hands in upstate New York , where he and his wife lived after his retirement . " He never got tired of making new rooms , " Gallagher writes . " When I was a kid , I thought he had made the world . " But as her parents grow more feeble , the house begins to rot away ; eventually it would take a team wearing surgical masks and gloves to clean it out . Her sweet mother is too pliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think straight . Yet to Gallagher , he is still the fearless man who arrived in steerage , took jobs selling bananas ( eating nothing but ) , delivering wet laundry in tenements before running his own garage . His only child finds that she ca n't tell her 90-year-old father ( who made the world , after all ) what to do . <P> Working backward through letters , photos and visits to relatives , Gallagher summons up a universe when a band of utopic Russian emigres arrives in a New York City that no longer exists . Penniless , working for a pittance , they are rich beyond their wildest dreams . She never says how much she actually loves this extended family , except by her affectionate yet dispassionate descriptions of them . There are Bella and Izzy as young communists in love , her father saving her mother from drowning , choosing her over her sister  --  a revelation to their daughter , who had been worried that her parents were n't romantic enough . There 's cousin Meyer , who fled to America to escape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hometown in Ukraine , raised another family in the U.S. but was so saddened by America 's role in Vietnam that he killed himself at 87 . And there 's Aunt Lily , the clan 's career woman , who sold lingerie door to door and married a bookish man , suspect in the family because he " seemed to have no politics . "
