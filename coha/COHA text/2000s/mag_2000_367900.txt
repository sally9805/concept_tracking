At first , the grains of rice that Ingo Potrykus sifted through his fingers did not seem at all special , but that was because they were still encased in their dark , crinkly husks . Once those drab coverings were stripped away and the interiors polished to a glossy sheen , Potrykus and his colleagues would behold the seeds ' golden secret . At their core , these grains were not pearly white , as ordinary rice is , but a very pale yellow  --  courtesy of beta-carotene , the nutrient that serves as a building block for vitamin A. <P> Potrykus was elated . For more than a decade he had dreamed of creating such a rice : a golden rice that would improve the lives of millions of the poorest people in the world . He 'd visualized peasant farmers wading into paddies to set out the tender seedlings and winnowing the grain at harvest time in handwoven baskets . He 'd pictured small children consuming the golden gruel their mothers would make , knowing that it would sharpen their eyesight and strengthen their resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the first modest start of a new green revolution , in which ancient food crops would acquire all manner of useful properties : bananas that would n't rot on the way to market ; corn that could supply its own fertilizer ; wheat that could thrive in drought-ridden soil . <P> But imagining a golden rice , Potrykus soon found , was one thing and bringing one into existence quite another . Year after year , he and his colleagues ran into one unexpected obstacle after another , beginning with the finicky growing habits of the rice they transplanted to a greenhouse near the foothills of the Swiss Alps . When success finally came , in the spring of 1999 , Potrykus was 65 and about to retire as a full professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich . At that point , he tackled an even more formidable challenge . <P> Having created golden rice , Potrykus wanted to make sure it reached those for whom it was intended : malnourished children of the developing world . And that , he knew , was not likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full complement of genes from Oryza sativa  --  the Latin name for the most commonly consumed species of rice  --  the golden grains also contained snippets of DNA borrowed from bacteria and daffodils . It was what some would call Frankenfood , a product of genetic engineering . As such , it was entangled in a web of hopes and fears and political baggage , not to mention a fistful of ironclad patents . <P> For about a year now  --  ever since Potrykus and his chief collaborator , Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg in Germany , announced their achievement  --  their golden grain has illuminated an increasingly polarized public debate . At issue is the question of what genetically engineered crops represent . Are they , as their proponents argue , a technological leap forward that will bestow incalculable benefits on the world and its people ? Or do they represent a perilous step down a slippery slope that will lead to ecological and agricultural ruin ? Is genetic engineering just a more efficient way to do the business of conventional crossbreeding ? Or does the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animals  --  give man more power than he should have ?
