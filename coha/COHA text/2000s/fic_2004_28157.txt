Without Any WarningNOTHING EVER STARTS where we think it does . So of course this does n't begin with the vicious and cowardly murder of an FBI agent and good friend named Betsey Cavalierre . I only thought that it did . My mistake , and a really big and painful one . I arrived at Betsey 's house in Woodbridge , Virginia , in the middle of the night . I 'd never been there before , but I did n't have any trouble finding it . The FBI and EMS were already there . There were flashing red and yellow lights everywhere , seeming to paint the lawn and front porch with bright , dangerous streaks . I took a deep breath and walked inside . My sense of balance was off . I was reeling . I acknowledged a tall blond FBI agent I knew named Sandy Hammonds . I could see that Sandy had been crying . She was a friend of Betsey 's . On a hallway table I saw Betsey 's service revolver . Beside it was a printed reminder for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stung . I forced myself to walk down a long hallway that led from the living room to the back of the house . The house looked to be close to a hundred years old and was filled with the kind of country clutter that she 'd loved . The master bedroom was situated at the end of the hall . I knew instantly that the murder had happened in there . The FBI techs and the local police were swarming around the open door like angry wasps near a threatened hive . The house was strangely , eerily quiet . This was as bad as it gets , worse than anything else . Ever . Another one of my partners was dead . The second one brutally murdered in two years . And Betsey had been much more than just a partner . How could this have happened ? What did it mean ? I saw Betsey 's small body sprawled on the hardwood floor and I went cold . My hand flew to my face , a reflex I had no control over . The killer had stripped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom . The lower body was coated with blood . He 'd used a knife . He 'd punished Betsey with it . I desperately wanted to cover her , but I knew I could n't . Betsey 's brown eyes were staring up at me , but they saw nothing . I remembered kissing those eyes and that sweet face . I remembered Betsey 's laugh , high-pitched and musical . I stood there for a long time , mourning Betsey , missing her terribly . I wanted to turn away , but I did n't . I just could n't leave her like this . As I stood there in the bedroom , trying to figure out something coherent about Betsey 's murder , the cell phone in my jacket pocket went off . I jumped . I grabbed it , but then I hesitated . I did n't want to answer . " Alex Cross , " I finally spoke into the receiver . I heard a machine-filtered voice and it cut right through me . I shuddered against my will . " I know who this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , dear , butchered Betsey 's . Do you feel a little bit like a puppet on a string , Detective ? You should , " said the Mastermind . " Because that 's what you are . You 're my favorite puppet , in fact . " " Why did you kill her ? " I asked the monster . " You did n't have to do this . " He laughed a mechanical laugh and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up . " You ought to be able to figure that out , no ? You 're the famous Detective Alex Cross . You have all those big , important cases notched on your belt . You caught Gary Soneji , Casanova . You solved Jack and Jill . Christ , you 're impressive . " I spoke in a low voice . " Why do n't you come after me right now ? How about tonight ? As you say , you know where I am . " The Mastermind laughed again , quietly , almost under his breath . " How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know where they are too . You left your partner with them , did n't you ? You think he can stop me ? John Sampson does n't have a chance against me . " I hung up and ran out of the house in Woodbridge . I called Sampson in Washington and he picked up on the second ring . " Everything okay there ? " I gasped . " Everything 's fine , Alex . No problems here . You do n't sound too good , though . What 's up ? What happened ? " " He said he 's coming for you and Nana and the kids , " I told John . " The Mastermind . " " Not going to happen , sugar . Nobody will get past me . I hope to hell he tries . " " Be careful , John . I 'm on my way back to Washington right now . Please be careful . He 's crazy . He did n't just kill Betsey , he defiled her . " I ended the call with Sampson and I sprinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again before I got to the car . " Cross , " I answered , still running as I spoke , trying to steady the phone against my chin and ear . It was him again . He was laughing maniacally . " You can relax , Dr. Cross . I can hear your labored breathing . I 'm not going to hurt them tonight . I was just fucking with you . Having some fun at your expense . " You 're running , are n't you ? Keep running , Dr. Cross . But you wo n't be fast enough . You ca n't get away from me . It 's you I want . You 're next , Dr. Cross . " ...
