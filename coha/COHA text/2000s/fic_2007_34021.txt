Chapter One Crazy is as crazy does ... Caleb Peachey jogged along the road , his eyes on the log cabin up ahead . It sat nestled in the thick woods on the banks of the Little Juniata River , almost hidden from view . He hoped to find the crazy woman at home this early in the morning . Crazy Claire , that 's what she was called by some of the locals . Dr. Claire Cassidy , historical archaeologist , by her colleagues . PhDiva , by him . Actually , he was beginning to feel like the crazy one as he attempted to make contact with the elusive woman . In fact , he was beginning to wonder if she even existed . Crazy Claire is gon na be Crazy-Friggin ' - Dead Claire if she does n't stop hiding from me . Five miles back and a half-hour ago , at dawn , he 'd left the Butterfly Bed &; Breakfast in Spruce Creek , where he and his team from Jinx , Inc. , a treasure-hunting firm , would be staying . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the team would be here this afternoon , but the project itself could n't start until Dr. Cassidy was on board , per orders of the National Park Service , which made sure no historical artifacts were disturbed . Now , he could understand the government being worried about metal detecting on a battlefield , trafficking in relics , defacing previously undiscovered prehistoric rock wall art , that kind of thing , but dammit , they were just going to take some pearls out of this cavern ... a privately owned cavern , to boot . They were n't exploring King Tut 's tomb here . Stopping in the clearing before the house , he bent over , hands on thighs , and breathed deeply in and out to cool down , not that he had broken a sweat or anything . Hell , he 'd been a Navy SEAL for ten years , up till two and a half years ago , and they ran five times as far before breakfast , wearing heavy boondockers , not the two-hundred-dollar ergonomically designed Adidas he had on now . He knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for some cats mewling inside . Same as yesterday , except there was a battered station wagon here now , which he took as a good sign . The woman had n't responded to the messages he 'd left on her answering machine , either . Hi ! This is Claire . Your message is important to me . Blah , blah , blah ! Caleb mimicked in his head . Apparently not that important . A fat calico cat-probably pregnant-sidled up to him and gave him the evil eye , as only a cat could do . Then she sashayed past , deeming him unworthy of her regard . With his side vision , he noticed another cat approaching , but , no , it was n't a cat ; it was a rat . Okay , it was a teeny-tiny dog that resembled a rat , and it started yip-yip-yipping at him as if it was a German shepherd , not a rat terrier . Caleb could n't fathom people who wanted such itty-bitty things for pets . But then , some people even took slimy creatures into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to snakes , he shivered . The dog stopped yipping and gave him the same you-are-so-boring look as the cat through its beady eyes and sauntered off , around the side of a modern addition to the old cabin . He decided to follow . The back of the cabin was a surprise . While the front was traditional log-and-chink design , the back was all windows facing the river , down below some fifty feet . Cushioned Adirondack chairs had been arranged on a wide deck . An open laptop sat on a low wooden table . You-know-who must be home . Ignoring my calls . Son of a bitch ! Oooh , someone is in big trouble . He turned toward the river . And inhaled sharply at the view . Not just the spectacular Little Juniata with the morning sun bouncing off the surface , creating diamond-like sparkles , fish actually jumping out of the water to feed on the seasonal hatch of newborn insects hovering above . He was familiar with this river , having grown up in an Amish community about ten miles down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman standing waist-deep in the middle of the river . She wore suspendered waders over a long-sleeved white T-shirt . Her long dark-red hair was pulled up into a high ponytail that escaped through the back of a Penn State baseball cap . Auburn , he thought her hair color was called . Could this possibly be the slippery Dr. Claire Cassidy ? Crazy Claire ? For some reason , he 'd expected someone older , more witchy-looking . It was hard to tell from this distance , but she could n't be much older than thirty , although who knew ? Women today were able to fool guys all the time . Makeup to look as if they were not wearing makeup . Nips and tucks . Collagen . Boob lifts , ferchrissake ! The woman was fly fishing , which was an art in itself . Caleb was the furthest thing from a poet , but the way she executed the moves was pure art in motion . Like a ballet . Following a clock pattern , she raised her long bamboo rod upward with her right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Then she allowed the rod to drift back slowly in the forward cast , stopping abruptly at eleven o'clock , like the crack of a whip . The follow-through was a dance of delicacy , because the fly should land on top of the water only for a few seconds , to fool the trout below water level that it was real live food . Over and over she performed this operation . It did n't matter that she did n't catch anything . The joy was in the casting . And in the watching . Dropping down to the edge of the deck , elbows resting on raised knees , Caleb breathed in deeply . The scents of honeysuckle and pine filled the early-morning air . Silence surrounded him , although it was not really silence if one listened carefully . The rush of the water 's current . Bees buzzing . Birds chirping . In the distance , a train whistle . He even saw a hawk swoop gloriously out of the mountains , searching for food . He felt as if he 'd been sucker punched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent seventeen years trying to forget . The Plain people , as the Amish called themselves , were practical to a fault . Fishing was for catching fish . No Lands End angler duds or fancy Orvis rods or custom-made flies . Just worms . But his Dat had been different . As stern as he was in many regards , he had given Caleb and his four brothers an appreciation for God 's beauty in nature and the heavenly joy of fly fishing . Much like that minister in the movie A River Runs Through It , Caleb 's old man had made fly fishing an exercise in philosophy , albeit the Old Order Amish way of life . Caleb smiled to himself , knowing his father would not be pleased with comparison to an Englisher , anyone not Amish , even a man of God . And , for sure and for certain , as the Amish would say , they did n't believe in that wasteful " catch and release " business , which the fisherwoman in front of him was doing now with a twenty-inch rainbow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to destroy God 's gift " ? No , if an Amishman caught a fish , he ate it . With homemade chowchow , spaetzle oozing with butter , sliced tomatoes still warm from the garden , corn fritters , and shoofly pie . Stomach rumbling with sudden hunger , Caleb shook his head to clear it of unwanted memories , stood , and walked down the railroad tie steps to the edge of the river . The woman glanced his way , then did a double take . After a brief hesitation , she waved . Yep , she must be crazy . He was a big man , six-four , and still carried the musculature that defined a Navy SEAL . The tattoo of a barbed-wire chain around his upper arm usually gave women pause . Plus , he was a stranger . But did she appear frightened ? Nah . She just waved at him . He could be an ax murderer , for all she knew . She was brave or stupid or crazy , he figured . Maybe all three . Enough ! He waded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his bare legs , his running shorts , and then the bottom of his T-shirt . Once he reached the woman , whose mouth was now gaping open , he gritted his teeth , then snarled , " Your phone broken , lady ? " She blinked . Tall for a woman-maybe five-nine-she was still a head shorter than him and had to crane her neck to stare up at him . " Ah , the persistent Caleb . " Then she smiled and shook her head as if he were not worthy of her attention . Just like her damn fat cat and her damn rat dog . Taken aback by her attitude , he failed to register the fact that she had , unbelievably , resumed fishing . She 's ignoring me . I do n't fuckin ' believe this . Three days of chasing my tail , and she thinks she can ignore me . I. Do n't . Think . So . Without warning , he picked her up and tossed her over his shoulder in a fireman 's carry , just barely catching the bamboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstream . With her kicking and screaming , he stomped through the water , probably scaring off every fish within a one-mile radius . " Put me down , you goon . " " Stop squirming . I 'll put you down when I 'm good and ready . We 're on my clock now , baby . " " Clock ? Clock ? I 'd like to clock you . " " I 'd like to see you try . " " I mean it . Put me down . Aaarrgh ! Take your hand off my ass . " " Stop putting your ass in my face . " " You are in such trouble . Wait till I call the police . Hope you know a good lawyer , " she threatened to his back . " Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm shakin ' in my boots ... rather , Adidas . " " Ha , ha , ha ! You 're not going to be making jokes once you 're in the clink . " The clink ? Have n't heard that expression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once on the bank , he propped the rod against a tree and stood her on her feet , being careful to hold on to one hand lest she take flight or wallop him a good one . " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? " she demanded , yanking her hand out of his grasp , then placing both hands on her hips . Ogling your hips . " Getting your attention . " " You got my attention when you failed to complete the Park Service forms for the project ... a month ago . " Oh , so that 's what has her panties in a twist . " They were fifty-three friggin ' pages long , " he protested . The dumbass red-tape forms asked him as Pearl Jinx project manager to spell out every bleepin ' thing about the venture and its participants . There were questions and subquestions and sub-subquestions . He 'd used a red Sharpie to write " Bullshit ! " across the empty forms and mailed them back to her . " Okay , my returning them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , my God , the Navy does n't do as much background checking for its high-security special forces as your government agency requires . " She snorted her opinion . " It 's not my agency . I 'm just a freelance consultant , specializing in Native American culture . You must know that Spruce Creek is situated right along what were once some major Indian paths . In fact , an Indian path from the village of Assunepachla , located near present-day Frankstown , merged with the Indian path from Standing Stone in Huntingdon , and that joint path took the Native Americans over Kitchinaki , Great Spruce Pine Land , till they came to Spruce Creek , which they called Oligonunk , or ' Place of the Cave . ' Spruce Creek was considered a good resting place for weary warriors . " Blah , blah , blah . " So ? " " So , Indian Caverns in Franklinville is only a mile or two away from the cavern you 'll be working , and it was loaded with artifacts . We have to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I needed a history lesson , sweetie , I would flick on the History Channel . " I 'm aware of all that , but you 're changing the subject . I must have put a dozen messages on your answering machine in the past thirty-six hours and God only knows how many before that . Guess how many times you called me back ? " He made a circle with a thumb and forefinger . She was lucky he did n't just give her the finger . " That does n't give you the right to manhandle me . " " That was not manhandling . If I was handling you , babe , you 'd know it . " " What a chauvinist thing to say ! " " Call me pig , just as long as you call me . " She threw her hands in the air with disgust , then shrugged her waders down and off , hanging them from a knot on the same tree where the rod rested . Underneath she wore dry , faded jeans and thick wool socks , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiot . I 've been gone for the past week . I got home late last night . That 's why I did n't return your calls . " Ooops ! " Oh . " Caleb had been working for two years on various Jinx treasure-hunting projects , but this was the first time he was a project manager . It was important to him that it be a success . Pissing off a required team member was not a design for success . " Sorry , " he said . " I misunderstood . " She nodded her acceptance of his apology and offered her own conciliatory explanation . " I like to spend time in the woods . " " How about using your cell phone to check messages ? " There I go , being abrasive again . " I do n't believe in cell phones . Besides , what would be the point of taking modern conveniences into the forest ? " He rolled his eyes . She does n't believe in cell phones . What century is she living in ? He tried to sound polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camping ? " " Not exactly . " Without elaborating , she started to walk up toward the cabin . He hated it when women stopped talking in the middle of a conversation , especially when the guy was being logical , not to mention bending over backward to tame his inner chauvinist . He caught up with her . " What was so important that you had to get in touch with me right away ? " she asked when they reached her deck . " Right away was three days ago , babe . " She arched her brows at his surliness , and probably at his use of the word babe , too . Tough shit ! He tamped his temper down , again , and replied , " The Pearl Project starts tomorrow . " " And ? " " We 've been told that you have to be there as a Park Service rep from the get-go . " " And ? " " And you have n't confirmed . " Her attitude was really starting to annoy him . Behave , Peachey . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead target . She arched an eyebrow at him again . " Since when do I need to confirm anything with you ? " Uh-oh ! Are we gon na have a pissing contest over who 's in charge ? I can guarantee it 's not gon na be her . If we have to vet every little anal thing , we 'll be here in the boonies for months instead of weeks . He put his face in his hands and counted to ten . When he glanced her way again , he said , " We have to find a way to work together . Truce ? " He extended a hand . She hesitated , but then agreed , " Truce , " and placed her hand in his . Her hand was small compared to his , with short , unpolished nails . He could swear his heart revved up at just the feel of her calloused palm pressed against his calloused palm . Am I pathetic or what ? " Are you hungry ? " That question caught him by surprise . Was her new strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Yeah , " he answered suspiciously . " Good . I picked some wild blueberries yesterday and have muffins cooling inside . " He did n't immediately follow her but sat down on one of the chairs to take off his wet shoes and socks . Meanwhile , the delicious aroma of baked goods wafted out to him . The rat dog trotted over and eyed his shoes . Just as it was about to take a chomp out of one of them , Caleb grabbed the shoes and set them up on the arm of the chair . When he turned , he saw the dog running off with one of his wet socks in its mouth . " Boney ! " Dr. Cassidy yelled out through the screen door at the thief . Four cats of various sizes were rubbing themselves against her ankles . The fat calico was n't among them . To his surprise , the dog stopped , peered back at its mistress dolefully , dropped the sock , and trotted off the porch and into the brush . " You named your dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not Boner . Boney . You know . Napoleon Bonaparte . Little dog . Napoleon complex . " Well , at least she has a sense of humor . " Did you know that Napoleon had a fear of cats ? Ailurophobia . " " No . Seriously ? " " Yep . Learned it in a history-of-war class . An aide found the general one time in his bedroom with a cutlass in hand , trembling , because he thought there was a cat behind a drape . " " Fascinating . " Yep , that 's me . Mister Fascination . Okay , I see five cats so far and one semi-dog . What next ? What next , he soon learned , was Indian tom-tom music , along with some guttural chants , coming from a tape deck inside : " Ay-yi-yi-yi ! Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi ... " Two cages in one corner , one holding what looked like a porcupine with a splint on its leg and the other holding a bird with mangled feathers . And the good doctor taking off her T-shirt , whose sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running bra kind of thing . Nothing scandalous . It was midway between a granny-type cotton undergarment and a hoochie mama Victoria 's Secret scrap of sexiness , but still ... It was pink . And there was all that skin . Bare arms . Bare midriff . Bare collarbones . Plus , she was ripped , which would explain the exercise mat and hand weights over there . Not weight-lifter ripped , but female-athlete ripped . And worst of all ... or best of all ... she had breasts that could make a grown man weep . (
