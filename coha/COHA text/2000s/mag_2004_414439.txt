You 'd never guess this eco-savvy home was built in a factory in just 19 days Photograph Sliding doors and wood screens open the modules to generous decks . Siding is coated corrugated steel . // It could have been the premiere of a summer blockbuster . The line to tour the Glidehouse , the modern , prefabricated home that debuted recently at Sunset 's Celebration Weekend event at our headquarters in Menlo Park , California , snaked out of sight . People waited for as long as an hour to get inside , which did n't stop one man from touring the house six times . Visitors asked if it would work for sites in Mexico , the San Juan Islands , Maui , and the desert . One person said , " I liked the design so much , I wanted to go home , burn my house down , and start over . " Why all the buzz ? Because with building costs soaring out of sight , there is pent-up demand for a well-designed , greenbuilt , contemporary home that 's actually affordable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best way to do this is in a factory , where it can be put together on an assembly line , like an automobile . The Glidehouse we displayed was built that way in 19 days in a factory near Vancouver , British Columbia , then trucked to our headquarters . Photograph Sliding doors ( at left ) and clerestory windows ( at right ) provide ventilation and balanced light . Mediastorage cabinets and a built-in buffet run the length of the room under the windows . // But the 1,344-square-foot twobedroom , two-bath house is no barebones Model T-it 's more like a Prius hybrid . It arrived nearly complete , down to the lightweight composite concrete countertops , slate tile backsplash , birch veneer built-in cabinetry , bathroom vanities , bamboo floor , and paint . The design , one of several versions by San Francisco Bay Area architect Michelle Kaufmann , is simple and ingenious : Think Japanesque contemporary ranch house or modern California bungalow ; do n't think mobile home . The Glidehouse is high-ceilinged and substantial , and affixes to a permanent , built-on-site foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 ) , two shed-roofed 14- by 48-foot rectangular modules are offset to create space for decks at each end . The kitchen and living/dining area occupy one module , which stays bright and airy thanks to a wall of sliding glass doors . The master suite , guest room , and guest bath are located in the other module . Big , rectangular wood screens on barn-door tracks slide across the windows of both modules to create shade and privacy without completely blocking natural light . Photograph The slate entry deck ( top left ) opens to the living/dining area . In the master bedroom , built-in cabinets surround the bed . The master bath features counters of composite concrete . // Kaufmann developed the initial plan after she and her husband , contractor Kevin Cullen , found they could n't afford to buy a house in the Bay Area . They decided to design and build one instead . " I was working on parallel tracks , " Kaufmann says . " For our site , the most affordable approach was to use structural insulated panels SIPs . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finding maximum dimensions for shipping the modules on flatbed trucks . That 's why each module is 14 by 48 feet . " Kaufmann eventually partnered with a modular design/build company , Construction Resource Group of Redmond , Washington , to develop the Glidehouse . The Glidehouse is built to the Uniform Building Code , which covers new construction within the United States . Controlled factory conditions ensure minimal waste of materials and time while reducing the opportunities for weather-induced mold to develop . The house costs $120 to $160 per square foot , depending on the materials and fixtures selected . While building costs vary by region , quality construction typically starts at around $250 per square foot and rises exponentially . Photograph The large deck we added dramatically expands the home 's livable space by providing room for a pizza oven and grill near the kitchen ; a sunken deck off the living room features a portable firepit . The perimeter bench functions as a railing and offers additional seating . // Kaufmann made it her goal to use environmentally friendly materials and worked with CRG 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . They set the criteria for energy conservation and interior air quality . " Meeting these criteria is the only way we are able to build the Glidehouse in many areas because of the house 's extensive glazing ; plus we feel it is the responsible way to build , " says Timi Starkweather , managing partner at GRG . The environmentally friendly materials and products that were selected for this Glidehouse design include bamboo flooring , concrete counters made of fly ash and recycled paper , soft foam insulation that fills all wall cavities , slate tiles , an energy-conserving heating system , an on-demand tankless water heater , and low-VOC ( volatile organic compounds ) paint . All woodto-wood joints were caulked to make the house airtight . Timeline to your house Here 's how the process of buying and installing a Glidehouse works . After securing land and financing , contact the sales team ( www.glidehouse. com or www.livemodern.com/ glidehouse ) . They will work with you to define your floor plan and select options or upgrades . They will also develop a site plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor . Construction Resource Group works with your contractor to develop the foundation plan , draw up a final construction cost estimate , and supervise foundation work as well as the factory assembly process . Construction at the factory begins after permits are issued by state and local building departments and after final cost estimates have been accepted . After arrival , it typically takes another few weeks to do the so-called " button-up work " of bolting the house to a perimeter foundation , adding the barn-door tracks for the sliding wood screens , installing the 26-gauge rolled-steel roof , and connecting wiring and plumbing . ( Following our event , the home 's owner , Andrew Reid , moved k to a lot near Lake Chelan in central Washington , where he 'll use it as a weekend retreat . ) Sunset 's ultimate deck Though designed to open to a deck or terrace , the Glidehouse does not come with a deck as part of the package , so Sunset senior Home writer Peter O. Whiteley designed one for our installation . His 2,000-square-foot deck-made of Timber-Tech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the back of the house , demonstrating the many ways outdoor space can expand a home . There 's a hot-tub relaxation zone off the master bedroom , an outdoor kitchen , a sunken sitting area , a dining area , and a slate entry deck . Back to the future The factory-built modern home is an idea whose time has come again . The concept of prefabrication showed early promise with the case Study Houses Program in Los Angeles during the 1950s , but progress stalled . Another lake on the idea , Eichler tract houses , brought contemporary architecture to a mass market between the late 1940s and the early 1970s , but they were assembled on-site . As Sunset wrote in 1978 , " The factory-built house has been a dream about to come true every year since the end of World War II . " Now it 's the Glide-house 's turn . We 're betting this blockbuster will have a long run .
