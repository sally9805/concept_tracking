The relationship between a man and his ( cute , adoring ) female assistant can be ... complicated . Still . This is extreme . // So I thought it would be funny to give my boyfriend a blow job in the handicap bathroom at work . He concurred . We picked a time with low hallway traffic , snuck in one by one , and had a blast . ( Yes , the handrail was helpful . ) Afterward , I experienced a renewed zest for the office and a strong sense of achievement . I shuffled back to my cube dying to tell someone . Actually , dying to tell my boss . He 'd appreciate the story more than anyone and be massively impressed . His door was closed-he was probably in a meeting-so I e-mailed him that an urgent matter needed immediate discussion . He poked his head out of his office and glared at me . " Wendy , what the fuck is so important right now ? " I whispered a one-sentence summary and his face lit up like the nose on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other executives out of the room so we could order Japanese and fully gab . As we ate our sashimi , he beamed with pride . " To giving head in a place of business ! " he exclaimed , raising his bottle of Dasani . " Long live the office hummer ! " I replied . Objectively , it was an absurdly good blow job . But telling my boss the story ( and basking in his reaction ) was probably the most orgasmic part of the entire escapade . In fact , I think it was the real reason I did it in the first place . WHEN MY BOSS arrived at the company a couple years earlier , I had been working as an administrative assistant for two young , fragile , high-maintenance men in different departments . So when I noticed this sane-looking person setting up his office on his very first day , I marched in , pleading , " Save me ... " He laughed . " I 'm serious , " I said . " Let me be your assistant . I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm good at phones . I 'll be fun to have around . " I think I was simply too pathetic to reject-or maybe he was blinded by my neon-red hair-but he hired me . I remember feeling relieved to see pictures of his wife on his desk and to hear that ababy was imminent . He was really sexy , and I did not want to work for an attractive guy who was single . My new boss may have had a beard to die for , but he was completely off-limits . A perfect combo . It 's scary adjusting to a new supervisor . But at least mine was the " new guy " joining an already formed family . Together the department tried to assess its future administration . Will he insist on actually looking at our dubious overtime sheets before signing off on them ? Or worse , is he the type to bcc : ? We all agreed that this dude seemed nice enough . He dressed a little too preppy , but the J.Crew ensembles went well with his cherubic face . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , he said , " I love it so much , obviously , ya know , but , well , ya know , I feel a little weird kissing it . I mean , it 's a guy . " My friend Jessi and I made intense eye contact . Were those the words of a homophobic frat boy ? But the very next day , my boss 's boss visited our office and hollered to her assistant , " In five minutes you need to start rolling some calls , okay ? ! " ( This is the retarded business practice whereby an assistant makes a call ahead of time and connects her boss when the other person is actually on the phone . ) Within two seconds , my boss hollered , with the same urgency , " Wendy , in five minutes you need to start rolling some joints , okay ? ! " I was in good hands . And so the assisting began . Now , just to be clear , I am a really bad assistant . I am highly disorganized , have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pads . But I offer something far more valuable than professionalism : an interesting office environment . I put Drakkar on the Post-its . I answer the phone with bad accents . Often I take significant pinchfuls of exceptionally prissy pink glitter from my makeup drawer and sprinkle it all over his budget reports . Once , early on , when my boss was doing his first on-camera interview , the reporter stopped and said , " Uh , people , we 're gon na have to do that again . Sir ? I ... I think you have a sparkle ? " Afterward he called me into his office and said , " Wendy , I 'm serious . I found glitter in my kid 's inner ear . Enough . " " Look , " I replied , " I 'm never gon na be one of those typical , boring , " legible handwriting , " " efficient , ' " competent " people . So if that 's what you want , then I have to leave . " " Calm down , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the best . Last Tuesday you stuck a gold star on my paycheck . " And for the first time as an administrative assistant , I felt truly appreciated and accomplished . I had always been properly thanked for specific tasks , but I 'd never been particularly praised . I had never heard a resounding " Amazing job ! " Probably because I never did an amazing job . But it 's nearly impossible to do an amazing job at coordinating a conference call . You either coordinate the call or you do n't . You ca n't put in tons of extra hours and coordinate the shit out of it . Because it is my responsibility to make everything go smoothly , my work is invisible unless something goes wrong . But this man noted my stupid little pranks and actually liked me for them . My boss , it appeared , was a rare breed-incredibly smart and driven without being cocky . And most important , he did n't seem to take his job too seriously . There 's nothing worse than corporate people who act like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOO ) seriously invested in our relationship the first time we smoked pot together . My boss had invited me to an office party at a bar . I was so psyched he had asked and so psyched to be out with him . There was this antique phone booth in the corner . We decided it would be fun to get high in it . As we walked over , it became apparent that Hugh Grant was leaning on the door . So my boss tapped Hugh on the shoulder and said , " Hey . We 're gon na do drugs in there . Wan na come ? " " Okay ! " Hugh replied , and the three of us tried to squeeze in . But there was clearly only enough space for two . " Get out , " I told my boss . " No , I 'm staying , " he said . " I 'm not gon na let anything happen here . I 'm gon na cock-block Hugh Grant . " " No , you 're not , " I replied , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there with Hugh Fucking Grant ( who definitely had foundation on his face ) , and as I passed him the one-hitter , I looked past him and saw my boss . Waving . Giving me a thumbs-up . And then all of the sudden Hugh started coughing in an embarrassing manner . " This grass is horrid ! " he yelped . " You 're poisoning me ! " He had the audacity to insult my weed . And it was from Amsterdam . " Well , " I said . " You obviously ca n't handle good drugs . " He stormed out . And my boss rushed in , begging for details . " He 's an idiot , " I announced , and we high-fived , then collapsed into the booth , laughing hysterically . Later , after a few more hours at the bar and a pit stop for fries at a late-night diner , he put me in a cab and insisted on giving me fare for the ride home . In bed that night , I tried to identify what had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Hugh Grant ( or even Hugh Grant 's makeup ) . The adventure seemed somehow different from a fun night out with a friend , but it was n't romantic , either . My boss is hot , but kissing him would have been incest . Huh . It occurred to me that I had never been close to an older male figure . ( My boss is only in his thirties , but because he has a family and is so successful , he seems much older than me . ) My father died when I was a baby . I was raised by a frighteningly feminine mother who only recently remarried . I decided I felt like a little kid who had just gone fishing with her supercool dad . The next morning was a little awkward . Like when you wake up after a potentially problematic one-night stand . Attempting to break the ice , I walked into his office to show him a funny photo of a really , really fat pigeon . He was n't there-he must have taken the new Us Weekly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of me holding a trophy at a knife-selling convention ( do n't ask ) and put it on his desk . We started going to lunch every now and then , and I 'd ask his advice about everything from serious boyfriend quandaries to writing my Friendster profile to understanding the basic concept behind a 401(k) . He was actively concerned with my wellbeing , and this made me feel safe . And then one night ( after another work event ) , we went to this massive candy store he 'd been telling me about for weeks . Turned out the massive candy store was actually very small-it just sold massive candy . Anyway , as we chomped on our golfball-sized Skittles and hugged goodbye , my adoration for this wise and caring hedonist became simply unbearable . " I love you , " I mumbled into the collar of his jacket . It made him extremely uncomfortable , and he pretended not to hear . Regardless , I was so relieved because it was finally out there . I was n't in love with him . ( Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . ) I just loved him so goddamn much . A couple weeks later , while we were quietly judging our colleagues ' outfits at the company Christmas party , he said , " I really love you , too , Wendy . " And I could n't stop smiling . MY ODDLY PATERNAL AFFECTION toward my boss was probably accentuated by the fact that I was watching him become an actual father . The same man who originally expressed concern about smooching another guy ( even though he was a week old ) began kissing his son on the lips for five minutes straight . I find the boy just as irresistible . When he smiles , it 's like he 's struggling to lift the corners of his mouth due to the weight of his puffy cheeks . He needs a cheek bra . And there 's no end to the cuteness . He 's cute and he 's cute and he just continues being cute . There is no closure , no cuteness orgasm . His thigh is like a juicy calzone . I want to devour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at that child , he 's so cute , I could just eat him up ! " But I mean it . After a few visits to my boss 's apartment , where I 'd play with the child for hours , I started to feel like a peripheral member of the household . A sort of lovable borderline stalker . With a growing urge to consume the entire adorable family . One evening I stayed after the kid 's bedtime and convinced my boss to smoke a joint and hang out . When his wife got home , she put on her pajamas and said , " I guess I 'll hit the sack now . " " Okay , " I said . " Great to see you ! " And then my boss and I stayed up for another hour watching The Matrix and munching on Corn Pops . Maybe it was the marijuana , but as I left , I got a little paranoid . His wife had never been anything but incredibly welcoming to me , but I wondered whether I might be just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room at midnight , being excessively giggly and eating all of our breakfast cereal . Weirdly , though , it did n't seem to bother her . If anything , it brought us closer . I began bonding with her about his moods . " Do n't talk to him this afternoon , " I 'd warn her . " Just e-mail . Trust me . " I was proud to be the official Other Woman in his life , monitoring his mania . But soon this level of intimacy began to fuck with my mind . My boss called the shots both professionally and personally , and the gears would shift too fast . One minute we 'd be sitting in our booth at our Japanese restaurant-I 'd be telling him the gory details about how my ex-boyfriend 's schlong was actually too big , and he 'd be laughing up a storm , holding up various glasses to guess the size-and the next I 'd be back at my desk being told in a very strict manner to make copies as soon as possible . As if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to take his aggravation out on me ( probably because we had gotten so comfortable ) , and I 'd find myself crying to my boyfriend about how this other man in my life yelled at me about a scheduling mishap . Normally , it would n't have been that upsetting to get chastised by a supervisor . ( I 'd been fucking up at work for almost a decade . ) But with him , I could n't not take it personally , even though I knew he 'd been up all night with a screaming baby and was simply in a pissy mood . Plus , I began to panic that my administrative errors would count against me as his friend . Basically , my work life had become a totally fucked up , modern-day version of The Mary Tyler Moore Show punctuated by faxing . And it followed me home at night and on weekends . WHICH MAKES IT all the more relieving/difficult to leave him . My acting career has just necessitated apermanent , scary move to California . I am aborn Manhattanite with zero ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think I 'm allergic to the sun . But somehow my biggest worry is that my boss wo n't love me anymore . Even though we 've spent a solid amount of time smoking really good bud , the feelings he has for me still stem from the fact that I 've been his employee . Once I 'm no longer in his face every day , will I become just another one of his many fondly remembered former assistants , getting a mere family-photograph card during the holidays ? Or will our relationship transcend the job ? I wish I knew . In the meantime , what 's plaguing me is that he 'll need to hire a new assistant . And there is someone already under consideration . About three months ago , I got off the elevator and spied a patch of short red dyed hair in a distant cube . As I got closer , I saw that the head was attached to a frilly Betsey Johnson dress . Some imposter who looks exactly like me had started working on the eleventh floor . Coworkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second Wendy . But my boss mocked my pain and referred to her as " New Wendy . " " Hey , there goes the newer version of you , " he would say . I kept passing her in the hallway . " Hi ! " she 'd chirp , and I 'd barely make eye contact . Finally , I forced myself to address the situation head-on . " So , " I said one afternoon when I ran into her in the stairwell . " Uh ... guess we look like each other , huh ? " ' ' " Yeah . . . heh , " she said . I glared at her hair , sending a subtle but unmistakable message . And the hue of her do got slightly brownish the very next day . But guess who just inquired about my position ? Dealing with the traumatic separation from my boss is one thing . Imagining someone else , particularly a woman , sitting in my chair attending to his needs ( probably in a way more reliable manner ) is quite another . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he really loves me , he wo n't hire her . This will be his first test . Meanwhile , I 've arranged for a young , intimidated male temp . I guess I 'm okay with that .
