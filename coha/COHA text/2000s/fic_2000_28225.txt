" They was all ripped , " the man said . " Their guts was spillin ' out . One of ' em had his heart laying open on his chest ! I 'm not for knowing how many bites the cat took of each . " " And ye 're thinkin ' this to be needed ? " the woman protested to Captain Kilronney . Kilronney turned a plaintive look upon Elbryan , but the ranger had his hand up , signaling that he would not press the issue further . He did n't need to . No hungry cat would leave as tempting a morsel as a heart uneaten , and no cat would spend the energy killing fleeing people when there was a fresh kill to be eaten . If the man 's description of the scene was accurate , then the Baron had not been killed by any natural beast . And of course that led Elbryan to even more disturbing thoughts . He had seen the gemstones at work many times , had spoken with Avelyn about them at length , and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal 's paw . " The men about the Baron , " the ranger began calmly , " did you know them all ? " " One was a friend , " the witness replied . " And I seen the others with him before . The Baron 's closest guard , they were ! " The ranger nodded . " I have heard that another -- not a soldier -- was traveling with Baron Bildeborough . " " The little fellow , " the woman remarked . " Yeah , we heared o ' him . " " And was his body at the camp ? " " Did n't see ' im , " the witness replied . That gave Elbryan a bit of relief but did n't confirm anything . The cat , if it was a cat , might have dragged Roger away to eat . Even more plausibly , the monk , if it was a monk , might have taken Roger prisoner , seeking information about Elbryan and Pony . " What is your course ? " he asked the Palmaris leader . " We come ridin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runners have been sent in every direction , " she replied . " The death of the Baron holds tremendous implications for Palmaris , " Shamus Kilronney remarked , " especially following so closely on the murder of Abbot Dobrinion . " " The city 's been in brew all the season , " the woman added . " The new abbot 's just returned from another trip to St.-Mere-Abelle -- some College of Abbots , whatever that might be meanin '  - -  and now he 's taken his place , and a bit more than that , but he 's not without his rivals . " The ranger nodded , hearing the words as confirmation of his worst fears . He had once met the new abbot of St. Precious -- only briefly but long enough to recognize that De'Unnero was an unpleasant man , full of fire and pride . Bildeborough 's death left a gaping hole in the power structure -- his only heir , Connor , was dead , as was Abbot Dobrinion -- that Abbot De'Unnero would hasten to fill . And the fact that De'Unnero had gone back to St.-Mere-Abelle for this college made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roger Lockless , in tow . It seemed to Elbryan then that the Abellican Church was a great black monster , rising to block out the sun . He considered his journey to Aida to battle the dactyl and his trip to St.-Mere-Abelle to steal his friends from the clutches of the Father Abbot , and he understood that those two missions had not been so very different -- not at all . " And what course for you ? " Elbryan asked Kilronney . The man blew a helpless sigh . " I should return to Palmaris , " he said , " to see if I can help secure the city . " " You are needed here , " the ranger reminded . " Winter may strike hard at these folk and bring in monsters that they can not overcome without your help . And then there is the matter of the caravan north , before the start of spring . " " Ye 're not for comparin ' the reopenin ' o ' the Timberlands to the security of Palmaris ? " the woman protested incredulously , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze -- one that reflected familiarity , Elbryan noted , thinking again that there might be a family relation here . The ranger looked at Kilronney , but the captain only shrugged , defeated by the simple logic of the woman 's statement . " What of the powrie band in the west ? " the ranger asked , for he and Kilronney had previously discussed their plans concerning one troublesome band of bloody cap dwarves who had not left the region , looming as a threat to any who might venture outside the secure area of Caer Tinella and Landsdown . " We will deal with them at once , " Shamus Kilronney offered . The woman soldier began to protest . " And then , if the weather holds and leaves the road clear , my men and I will turn to the south , " Shamus said in a tone that left no room for debate . The woman growled and turned away to stare intently at the ranger . " I give you Nightbird , " Captain Kilronney said , finally introducing him . The ranger lifted his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman asked , her expression sour . " A strange name . " " And this is Sergeant Colleen Kilronney of the Palmaris guard , " Shamus explained . " Your sister ? " the ranger asked . " Cousin , " replied Shamus , somewhat distastefully . " From the better part o ' the family , " Colleen was quick to put in , and Elbryan could n't tell if her tone was serious or not . " Oh , me cousin 's learned to speak so proper and pretty for courtin ' ladies in Ursal . He 's even been to the King 's dinner table . " Shamus glowered at her , but she just gave a derisive laugh and turned to the ranger . " Well , Master Nightbird --  " she began . " Just Nightbird , " the ranger explained . " Well , Master Nightbird , " Colleen went on without missing a beat , " seems ye 've got yer fight with the bloody caps . Me and me soldiers 'll go along for the fun . We 're all a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be good for us to take out our worrys on the powries . " The other two Palmaris soldiers , grim-faced , nodded . Shamus Kilronney said , " We have not much time . The battlefield must be chosen and prepared . " " Ye make yer own battlefield when ye draw yer sword , " stubborn Colleen put in . Elbryan eyed the captain and then his cousin . There was an intense rivalry here , obviously , and the ranger understood that such feelings could lead to disaster in a fight . " I will learn where the powries have gone and choose the appropriate ground for our attack , " he said , and he walked from the tent . " Ye 're a bit trustin ' , " he heard Colleen complain . " None can prepare a battlefield better than Nightbird , " Shamus was saying as Elbryan , shaking his head and smiling , mounted Symphony and started away . His amusement over Colleen Kilronney was short-lived , though , lasting only as long as it took him to consider again the grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the encampment even as he was leaving it , and he trotted Symphony over to her . She eyed him suspiciously , and she knew even before he began to speak that something was wrong . " Baron Bildeborough was murdered on the road , before he ever got near Ursal , " Elbryan said , sliding down to stand beside his wife , " along with all his guard -- though no sign of Roger was discovered among the dead . " " Powries again ? " came Juraviel 's voice from the trees , dripping with sarcasm . " Same clan that killed Abbot Dobrinion , no doubt . " " That thought may hold more truth than you believe , " the ranger replied . " Those who found the Baron say he was killed by a great cat , but while the wounds might prove consistent with such a creature , I doubt the motive will . " " Tiger 's paw , " Pony spat , referring to the gemstone the monks could use to transform their limbs into those of a great cat . She closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elbryan draped his arm around her shoulders , sensing that she needed the support . Every new encounter or word about the Abellican Church weighed heavily on Pony ; every action these monks engaged in that was so unholy , so against the principles that had guided dear Avelyn , only reinforced her grief for her lost parents . " Palmaris is in turmoil , " Elbryan said , speaking more to Juraviel . " Our time with Captain Kilronney and his soldiers grows short . We should dispatch that powrie band before we depart . " " And what of Roger ? " Pony was quick to ask . " Are we to continue our duties here , even go further away , while he might be in terrible peril ? " Elbryan held his hands out helplessly . " There was no sign of Roger , among the dead or anywhere on the road , " he explained . " He may have been taken , " Juraviel offered . " If he has been sent to St.-Mere-Abelle , I will go back , " Pony declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elbryan . He suspected that she meant to go in through the front doors this time , and leave little standing in her wake . " And if he has been taken , then of course we will go for him , " Elbryan assured her . " But we do not know that , and in the absence of evidence , we must hold our trust in Roger and continue our planned course . " " But if we continue to the north , or go against the powries , how will we discern Roger 's fate ? " Pony protested . It was a dilemma , but the ranger remained unconvinced that they should drop everything and go in search of Roger Lockless . The man was a survivor . When Elbryan and Juraviel had gone into Powrie-occupied Caer Tinella to rescue him , they had found him already free . " I have no answers , " the ranger admitted . " I know that I must trust Roger . If he was killed on the road , then there is nothing I can do about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pony 's words cut deep . Elbryan stared at her as if she were a stranger , some different person than the one he had come to love so dearly . Pony could n't match that stare . She lowered her head and sighed again . " Of course you would , " she admitted . " I am afraid for Roger , that is all . " " We can send word to Belster O'Comely in Palmaris , " Juraviel offered . " The city is too large for us to go wandering about in an attempt to locate Roger . But Belster , so centered in the town , might be able to glean some information . " " All gossip flows through Fellowship Way , " Pony added hopefully . " I will go to Tomas Gingerwart , " Elbryan offered , " and secure a trusted courier . " " None would prove more trustworthy than I , " Pony said as the ranger took a step away . Elbryan stopped in his tracks and closed his eyes ; it took a long while for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her slowly , astonished that she would take such a step . " I must go and meet with Bradwarden , " Juraviel remarked . " We will scout out the powries and report this evening . " And the elf was gone , leaving the two , who had hardly heard his words , to their conversation .
