Mom always says the difference between a trip and a vacation is the quantity of dirty laundry after it 's over . A visit to Aunt Kate 's house would be considered a tripnever lasts more than two days , only one change of underwear , two max . However , traveling from Texas to California ? Definitely a vacation . Dad had been in Los Angeles all spring . But he was n't on vacation . His aircraft company sent him out there . One of the reasons Dad was asked to go was because he 's a brilliant engineer . And he 's a great problem solver , too . At least that 's what he tells us . His boss wanted him to work out some wrinkles in the L.A. office . It was n't that he had n't missed us , but he 'd said a million times how much he liked it on the West Coast . I was busy researching a school project on my computer when Directions Man popped up on my Buddy List . Hey , Dad ! I Instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the perfect name for him . How 's it going ? Miss you guys , he IM 'd back . Same here . The Pacific Ocean is awesome , Jason , and the weather is fantastic . I want to see for myself , I wrote him . Were there palm trees and movie stars on every corner ? Did everyone drive a convertible ? I could almost taste the salty ocean air . You 'd love it , Mania Man , came his answer , flying across my monitor . Everyone knows my screen name . I chose it after the greatest game show of all time , Masquerade Mania . It 's the best . All the contestants are kids . Almost everyone in our sixth-grade class watches , especiallyFreddy and me . Even my parents and my pain-in-the-neck older sister , Jen , like it . It 's hilarious . The master of ceremonies is this beautiful long-haired girl named Jasmine . Dad says she gives the show class . At the beginning of the show , she glides down a winding staircase like melting butter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that guy is cool . He wears this wild suit . The stripes on his pants go up and down and the circles on his jacket go across . He has a bow tie that lights up when he talks . I 'm sure he 's the creative genius behind the show . Desmond O teases the contestants in the Hot Box . He wants to confuse them so that they 'll give wrong answers to Jasmine 's trivia questions . Jasmine asks a question and the first kid to press his buzzer gets to answer . The questions are tough . It takes a real brain-o to think fast enough to get them right . After a contestant answers three questions correctly he gets a chance to Spin to Win . His spin could land him on a prize . It 's unbelievable what they give awayportable M players with headphones , DVD home theater systems , video games , skateboards , televisions , great vacations , sometimes even college scholarships . Once I saw this kid win an Xbox and a year 's supply of video games and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came to . But my favorite part is when a contestant lands on a WHOOPS ! That 's when the real fun begins . If you land on a WHOOPS ! Desmond O makes you do crazy stunts . Like jumping into a tub of Jell-O , or doing a funny dance while Desmond O plays his kazoo . Sometimes he forces a contestant to run an obstacle course against a ticking clock . That 's the most nerve-wracking part of all . You never know what to expect if the clock wins . Buckets of slimy spaghetti could drop from the ceiling ! You could be pelted with water balloons . Three WHOOPS ! and zap ! You 're out of the game . You have to be careful or you could go home empty-handed and covered in chocolate syrup . Did you catch last night 's show ? I typed . I did n't have to explain . Dad would know exactly what I meant . ' Fraid not , he typed back . I was still at the office . It was really cool , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me like he used to . A kid dressed up as a tube of toothpaste won a trip for four to New York City ! His costume was flipped out . He 'd even carried a plastic bag filled with dental floss . As I sat at my computer , I got this fantastic idea . I 'm always getting fantastic ideas . Since you 're so great at working out wrinkles , I IM 'd Dad , why do n't you work out a way for us to fly to Los Angeles , too ? I was dying to fly on a plane . And not only that , maybe I 'd have a chance to get on Masquerade Mania ! If that happened , I 'd be a real Maniac for sure . Sounds good , he IM 'd back . Ejsy ? I typed so fast I did n't realize my fingers were on the wrong keys . What ? I retyped almost as fast . When ? Soon . Next thing I knew , Dad was on the phone with Mom , Mom was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , and our family was California bound ! Well , not exactly the whole family . My bulldog , Patches , would be checking in to the doggie motel . And Baby Millicent would probably stay at Aunt Kate 's house because Mom always says he who travels swiftest does not carry a diaper bag . Millicent is two years old . Her track record in the potty-training department leaves a lot to be desired . But sometimes Mom gets guilt pangs when she thinks one of us is not getting a fair shake . So Millicent might luck out and land on the plane with Jen and me . If that happens , I 'm letting Jen take care of her . What else is a big sister good for , anyway ?
