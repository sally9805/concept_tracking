BODY LANGUAGE Headnote MIND , BODY , AND SPIRIT Headnote To stem the pain , act fast when treating burns . Headnote You touch the stove burner , thinking it 's cool . Or bump the bottom of a hot pot . Or pick up a blackened chunk of firewood , unaware that it 's red hot on the bottom . However it happens , your response is the same : your hand jerks back involuntarily , you utter words Mom would n't approve of , and then you inspect the burned area . // Your flesh keeps burning after you remove it from the heat source . Even though hours might pass before a blister appears , treating the injury within the first few moments is critical for reducing the pain of the burn and the size of the blister . Act fast enough , and you may even prevent one from developing . Your best bet is to plunge the burned area immediately into cold water , which cools the skin ; as long as heat remains in the tissues , the burning sensation continues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay well hydrated , and take ibuprofen to reduce the pain and inflammation . After that , try the treatment methods below to help healing . * For a superficial ( first-degree ) burn , which is characterized by red , painful skin ( as in sunburn , for example ) , a skin moisturizer often is all that 's needed . * Partial-thickness ( second  --  degree ) burns produce painful blisters . Moisturize the area around the blister and then cover the area with gauze or a Spenco 2nd Skin Moist Burn Pad to protect it . If ( or , rather , when ) the blister ruptures , cautiously peel off the dead skin and gently wash the sore . For maximum healing , apply antibiotic ointment and a new dressing to the affected area ; keep it on until the skin has healed . * With a full-thickness ( third-degree ) burn , the skin is black and charred after being exposed to an open flame , or pale and colorless after scalding . The burn site itself may not be painful , but extreme pain typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply antibiotic ointment and gauze . Third  --  degree burns larger in size than a quarter seldom heal well without a doctor 's care , but there 's no rush to find a physician if you keep the burn area clean . But beware ! Partial- or full-thickness burns covering 15 to 20 percent of the body-both arms , a leg , the chest , or the back , for instance-are life-threatening . A serious burn on the face can also be a significant risk if swelling of the airways results , possibly leading to suffocation . Immediate evacuation to a hospital is vital . ANOTHER TICK-BORE DISEASE You can add another disease to those you might get from ticks : ehrlichiosis . Like Lyme disease , ehrlichiosis is carried by deer ticks and causes flulike symptoms , including fever and body aches . But unlike Lyme , no distinctive rash accompanies infection . A Yale University report says the disease , unknown in humans until 1986 , is appearing much more often than was first estimated , and " has been found in many areas of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , ehrlichiosis typically causes less serious problems than does Lyme disease , but it still should be treated by a physician . Quick tick removal can prevent both diseases , so do a daily inspection and carefully remove all ticks . If you can , save any tick you remove so your doctor can have it tested . COLD DOES N'T ALWAYS MEAN DEAD If you worry about exposure to cold , take heart : You can freeze to death and still live to tell about it . In May 2000 , 29-year-old Anna Bagenholm slipped while skiing and ended up head down , wedged between ice and rock in a waterfall near Narvik , Norway . As friends tried to free her , Bagenholm struggled for 40 minutes , then hung limp for 40 minutes more . CPR was initiated when her pulseless , breathless , clinically dead body was finally recovered . A core temperature of 57'F was recorded in the hospital , where resuscitative efforts continued for 9 hours . Miraculously , Bagenholm eventually walked out of the hospital without brain damage . Despite losing some function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world record for recovery from hypothermia to the lowest core temperature .
