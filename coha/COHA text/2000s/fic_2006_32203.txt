Rococo By Adriana Trigiani Random House Adriana Trigiani The Duke of Decor on the Jersey Shore 1970 I want you to imagine my house . It 's a classic English country cottage , nestled on an inlet overlooking the Atlantic Ocean in the borough of Our Lady of Fatima , New Jersey , about five miles north of Interlaken . The fieldstone exterior gives the illusion of a small fortress , so I softened the overall effect with white hyacinth shrubs and a blanket of sky-blue morning glories cascading over the dormers like loose curls on a cherub . After all , a man 's home must first be inviting . Every morning at sunrise a honeyed pink light fills the front room , throwing a rosy glaze on the walls that can not be achieved with paint . Believe me , I 've tried . I settled instead for a neutral shade on the walls , a delicate beige I call flan . When the walls are tame , the furnishings need to pop . So I found the perfect chintz , with giant jewel-toned flowers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background , to cover my Louis Quatorze sofa and chairs . The upholstery soaks up the light and warms the room better than a fire blazing in the hearth . Anyone who says you will tire of a bold pattern on your furniture is a fool . The right fabric will give you years of joy ; it can become your signature . Scalamandre 's Triomphe #26301 has my name on it . My day begins at dawn as I take my cup of strong black espresso outside to watch the sunrise . I learned this ritual from my mother , who worked in a bread shop . Bakers are the great philosophers of the world , mostly because they have to get up early . When the world is quiet , great art is created -- or , at the very least , conceptualized . Now is the moment to sketch , make notes , and dream . From my front porch , a dignified , simple portal with a slate floor ( I laid the charcoal-gray , dusty-mauve , and smoky-blue slabs myself ) , I watch the colors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes the ocean crashes in foamy white waves that look like ruffles . Then , suddenly , the light is gone and everything turns to gray satin . When the sun returns , the charcoal clouds lift away and the world becomes as tranquil as a library , the water as flat as a page in a book , Venetian glass under a blue cloudless sky . What a boon to live on the water ! Such delicious shades and hues ! This is a template worthy of the greatest painters . The textures of sand and stone could inspire incomparable sculptures , and the sounds -- the steady lapping of the waves , the sweet chirping of the birds -- make this a sanctuary . I soak up the view in all its detail and translate this glorious palette to the interiors of local homes . You see , I am the Town Decorator . Many have compared our little borough to the village my family emigrated from , the enchanting Santa Margherita nestled in the Gulf of Genoa on the Mediterranean coast of Italy . I 've been there , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its earthiness and charm , can never be New Jersey . Here we value evolution and change ; Italy , while it warms the heart , is a monument to the past . In America we change our rooms as often as our fashions . In Italy you 're likely to find throw pillows older than the Shroud of Turin . It 's just a different way to live . Part of my job is to convince my clients that change is good , then guide them to the right choices . I remember when I installed a velvet headboard on my cousin Tiki Matera 's double bed ( she was plagued by insomnia from the cradle ) and she told me that , for the first time in her life , she felt so secure that she slept through the night . That Art Deco touch changed her room and her life -- not a small thing . That 's the business I 'm really in : creating appropriate surroundings to provide comfort and that essential touch of glamour . I built my company , the House of B , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartolomeo di Crespi and the guts of beauty itself : truth , color , and dramatic sweep , from slipcover to oven mitt . I do n't fool around . My work ca n't be defined by one particular style . The rococo period where French design and Italian flair came together make my heart leap for joy in my chest . But , I love them all : Chinese Modern , Regency English , French Norman , Prairie Nouveau , Victorian ( without the precious ) , Early American ( with the precious ) , all the Louises from I through V ( Vuitton , of course ) , postwar , prewar , bungalow , foxhole , and even the occasional log cabin . I can go big and I can do small . I work from the inside out . Truly great interior design includes the rooms you live in and everything your eye can see from your windows . I often bring the colors from outside indoors , which soothes the soul and creates harmony . I may install a reflecting pool outside your living room to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rose arbor anchored over a flowing fountain beyond your kitchen window , or perhaps place a wrought-iron loveseat surrounded by lilac bushes outside your bedroom for a midnight rendezvous . Your home should inspire you to greater heights of emotion . It should crackle with color and pizzazz . Every detail is important ; every tassel , tieback , and sheer should say something . Under my trained eye , stale corners become Roman baths , while bland entryways become magnificent foyers and crappy pasteboard ceilings become frescoes . Let 's face it , I can take a ranch and turn it into a villa . In fact , I did that very thing right on Vittorio Drive , three blocks away . My life as a decorator began not with a sudden flash of inspiration , but with a problem . I was born without symmetry . This is not my real nose . As soon as I was old enough to pull myself up onto the stool in front of my mother 's dressing table ( an Art Deco red enamel vanity with a pink velvet seat circa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to study my face from three angles , I realized that something had to be done . From the east , my nose looked like the fin on a Cadillac , from the west , a wedge of pie , and dead on , a frightening pair of black caverns , two nostrils so wide and deep you could lose your luggage in them . It had to go . As an Italian American , I was born into a family of prominent noses . The di Crespi clan was known for their fish ( Pop had a dinghy for clamming and crabbing , and a storefront in town to sell his catch ) and their profiles . We were not alone . Our neighbors were also of Italian descent , many from the same village , and they too had versions of The Beak . The variations included all possible shapes , angles , and appointments , all with the same result : too large . I was raised to be proud of my cultural and nasal heritage , so it was n't shame that brought me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct is to create balance . Faces , like buildings , require good bones . As soon as I could save up enough money ( I worked after school and for five summers in the Mandelbaums ' bank as a coin sorter and roller ) , I took the bus from Our Lady of Fatima ( OLOF ) to the office of Dr. Jonas Berman on East Eighty-sixth Street in Manhattan . I was eighteen years old with a spiral-bound sketch pad under my arm and a checkbook in my pocket . First , I 'd drawn a self-portrait in charcoal , showing my original nose . Then , in a series of detailed drawings , I fashioned the nose I wanted from every angle . Dr. Berman flipped through the pad . Amazed at my artistic skill , he cited Leonardo da Vinci 's pencil sketches of early flying machines as being substandard to my talent . If I was going to have rhinoplasty , I wanted to make sure I had the nose of my dreams . I did n't want a hatchet job that would leave me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and classic . In short , Italianate without the size . I got exactly what I wanted . My sister , Toot ( as in the song " Toot , Toot , Tootsie , " not the toot of a horn ) , who is eleven years older than me , was the first person to see my new nose when the swelling went down . She was so thrilled at the result that she convinced my father to sell his car so she could have the same surgery . My father , never one to tell a woman no , paid for her to have The Operation ( as my mother came to call it ) . Never mind that I had worked like a farmer to earn my new profile . But I do n't hold a grudge . Toot elected to have her nose done not in New York City by my capable surgeon , but by a doctor in Jersey City who was rumored to have given Vic Damone his signature tilt . ( I am the only person in my family who does not believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandages off , Mom , Pop , and I were there for the unveiling . Mama clapped her hands joyfully as Papa got a tear in his eye . Talk about change . Her new nose had a sharp tip with an upturn so steep you could hang a Christmas stocking off it . Gone was her old nose , which had looked like an elbow ; but was this delicate Ann Miller version an improvement ? To be fair , the new nose gave my sister the dose of self-confidence she needed . She suddenly believed she was beautiful , so she went on a spartan diet of well-done steak and raw tomatoes and lost a good thirty pounds , tweezed her eyebrows and straightened her hair ( by sleeping on wet orange-juice cans every night for a year ) , and , shortly thereafter , in the right pair of black clam diggers and a tight angora sweater , fell in love with Alonzo " Lonnie " Falcone , a jeweler , at a Knights of Columbus weenie roast in Belmar . Six months later they had a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons followed in short order . Her nose may not be perfect , but it was lucky . 817 Corinne Way has been Toot 's address for eighteen years . After they lived for a couple of hardscrabble years in a row house in Bayonne , Lonnie 's business took off , so they bought a home in OLOF to be near my folks . When Toot and Lonnie divorced , she got the house , a lovely Georgian with grand Palladian columns anchoring a polished oak door trimmed in squares of leaded glass . I pull up in the driveway next to my sister 's chartreuse Cadillac . I get out of the car , taking a small footstool that I reupholstered for Toot with me . The lawn is freshly mowed and green . The boxwood hedges are trimmed and tidy . Everything about the exterior of the house is appropriate except for one glaring design misfire : My sister mucked up the entrance with a countrified porch swing she found at a tag sale in Maine . I tell her that a Georgian with a porch swing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swing and I keep my mouth shut . The truth is , I 'm a little afraid of her . Toot has always been a second mother to me , and any Italian son will tell you that two Italian mothers in a lifetime is a handful . I 'm not complaining , because we adore each other ; I defer to her on family matters , and she to me on aesthetic ones ( most of the time ; after all , she kept the swing ) . " I 'm here ! " I holler cheerfully . Toot 's house always smells of anisette and fresh-perked coffee , the lovely bouquet of our mother 's home . " Back here , B , " she yells . Carrying the footstool I 'd re-covered in pale blue wool for her boudoir , I make my way down the long hallway , which is papered in a Schumacher pale-yellow-and-white paisley print . I decorated the entire house , but my favorite room is her kitchen . I did a real number on it . First , I sent my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three months . Then I gutted the old kitchen . I installed a bay window on the back wall to maximize the light and designed a Roman shade of pure white muslin to let in the sun but keep out the nosy neighbors . Underneath I built a window seat with cushions covered in a practical red cotton twill ( Duralee Hot Red #429 ) . I believe that any fabrics used in a kitchen should be washable . For fun , I used oversized zippers on the seat cushions to pick up the metal accents of the appliances . To bring nature indoors , I used rustic white birch paneling on the wall around the window . I papered the remaining walls with a bold Colefax and Fowler red-and-white stripe and installed white Formica cabinets with red ceramic pulls . The result is peppermint-candy delish ! The countertop , in white marble , has an extension that swings out in an L shape to make a breakfast nook , with sleek bar stools covered in white patent leather with brass-stud trim . The studs are an excellent accent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like charms on a bracelet . The refrigerator ( side-by-side ) and stove ( gas ) were purchased in white , but I had them delivered to Chubby 's Garage , where they were jet-spray-painted a bright , shiny , fiery red . I 'm forever thinking of ways to give design that extra kick , using unlikely sources . Take note . The kitchen table is topped with wide white ceramic tiles . Beneath the table , I installed a cutting board that pulls out for additional workspace . It comes in handy when Toot makes pasta . The table is surrounded by cozy booth seating in a cheerful red gingham . The palette works . It 's vibrant ! It 's up ! When you stand in this kitchen , you feel as though you are on the inside of a tomato , the exact effect I wanted . " You like my pants set ? It 's new . " Toot does her version of a model 's twirl , pointing her right foot out in front of the left and holding her arms out waist-high like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white pilgrim collar on a cable-knit orange cardigan . ( I can see that the wool is a fine cashmere , but what good is it ? The eye sees round , round , round instead of sleek . My sister needs length , not width . ) The brown slacks have a wide bell hem . She looks like a piece of candy corn . " It 's a St. John knit , " she says , giving me an in-the-know wink . " Only a saint could get away with such a color combination , " I say . Like all Mediterranean girls , my sister is aging well . By soft candlelight or with the help of a dimmer switch , she has the look of a plump Natalie Wood . In broad daylight , she 's a dead ringer for our great-grandmother , the pleasantly pudgy Bartolomea Farfanfiglia , whom we never knew , but who stares at us with disgust from a sepia photograph on the television set .
