Section : TOP 100 TEST Center <p> DVD BURNERS HAVE BECOME increasingly common on top flight desktops . And if the power side of the chart is any indication , feature on heavy-duty PCs . Six of the seven power units come with a DVD burner  --  including all three new entries , Amax 's AMD Max 3200+ , PC Power &; Cooling 's SleekLine 3000MX , and MPC 's Millennia 920i Professional . The dual-format burners on these three models can handle DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW , reflecting the current industry trend toward supporting two leading DVD recording formats . <p> At number four , the Amax AMD Max 3200+ we tested came with a 2,2-GHz Athlon XP 3200+ CPU ( with a 400-MHz frontside bus ) and 512MB of DDR400 SDRAM . This system earned a very respectable PC WorldBench 4 score of 134  --  just two points less than the Sys Technology Performance 3200+ , which has the same CPU and operating system with double the memory . We particularly liked the look of the Amax 's chassis , with its stainless steel door covering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it displayed dark , too  --  saturated colors , and the integrated speakers produced weak , muddy bass tones . For good sound , you might want to order this model with a separate speaker set . <p> At number six , PC Power &; Cooling 's SleekLine 3000MX comes with what is easily the slimmest case  --  4 inches  --  on our chart . Though its price is stratospheric at $3699 , this unit is packed with performance-oriented components , such as a 3.2-GHz Pentium 4 that posted an outstanding PC WorldBench score of 136 . <p> The SleekLine 3000MX outperformed the similarly equipped Dell Dimension 8300 and MPC Millennia 920i by 9 points ( or about 8 percent ) each . Some of that extra oomph can be attributed to the system 's slightly overclocked processor ( it 's cranked up by 2 percent , which is within Intel 's spec for the chip and , according to PC Power &; Cooling , wo n't affect the system 's durability ) . Inside the black chassis is a quiet power supply . <p> MPC 's Millennia 920i debuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications such as video editing . Our test unit was outfitted with a gargantuan 250GB hard drive , three FireWire 400 ports , a dual-format DVD burner , and ( like half of its power chart peers ) a high-performing , 128MB ATI Radeon 9800 Pro graphics card that delivered bright , smooth images for games and DVD movies . <p> We also tested Polywell 's Poly 865RF  --  3200 this month , but this model , despite carrying a 3.2-GHz Pentium 4 CPU and 1024MB of DDR400 SDRAM , missed our power list due to surprisingly mediocre performance . Our test system mustered a score of just 118 on PC WorldBench 4 , a poor showing for a power system . <p> The Dell Dimension 8300 's price drops $688 this month ; it remains in second place on the power section . <p> Meanwhile , our value list has a new Best Buy , Dell 's Dimension 4600 , and two new entries from Hewlett-Packard . Placing second , the Compaq Business Desktop D325 is a no-frills system that delivers good performance at a bargain price of $833 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scored a solid 122 on PC WorldBench 4 . We liked this model 's expandability ( it has three open PCI slots , an AGP slot , two 5.25-inch drive bays , and one internally accessible 3.5-inch drive ) and dual VGA ports for two analog monitor inputs . <p> In fifth place on the value section , the HP Pavilion A250n replaces the better-performing ( but now retired ) A250e . Our evaluation unit  --  equipped with a 2.6-GHz Pentium 4 CPU and 512MB of DDR333 SDRAM  --  turned in a good score of 116 on PC WorldBench 4 . This system impressed us with both its thoughtfully constructed chassis and its excellent 15-inch LCD monitor . <p> Visit find.pcworld.com/37850 for reviews of all products tested this month and ranked in this chart . TABLE <p> MPC 's VIDEO dream system , the Millenia 920i , has a 250GB hard drive and three FireWire ports . <p> TECH TREND PC Vendors Start to Make Multimedia Easy <p> AIMING TO HELP NEW USERS get over the hurdle of learning to work with digital media , Dell and HP this fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will walk you through common multimedia tasks . <p> HP 's photography software suite , called Image Zone , adds new features to the same software that the company already ships with its scanners , printers , and digital cameras . The enhanced software will be installed on all of the company 's new Pavilion and Media Center PCs this fall , as well as on its notebooks . <p> Dell expects to include its Media Experience software on all Dimension desktops , though not on the company 's Media Center PC . Neither vendor is charging extra for its software , but Dell will offer a remote control for an additional $30 . <p> As its name implies , HP 's Image Zone focuses on digital imaging tasks . The software hooks into the operating system 's My Pictures folder and automatically launches when you click My Pictures . According to HP , which showed us an early beta of the software , Image Zone will offer a simplified interface for organizing photos , performing quick edits ( such as cropping or removing red-eye ) , and adding photos to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HP Memories Disc Creator . In addition , you can rename images ( though you ca n't perform batch renaming ) , and you can restore images that you 've edited to their original form . <p> Whereas HP 's suite sticks to still images , Dell 's ambitious Media Experience covers all digital media , including DVD . Media Experience consolidates access to and playback of media under a single roof , replacing the disparate apps ( such as Windows Media Player and a DVD software player such as Cyberlinks Power DVD ) that you might otherwise have turned to . The opening screen has links for music , pictures , videos , and DVD , The DVD link launches Dell 's own software player for viewing DVD movies . <p> The other three media links tap into Windows XP 's My Music , My Pictures , and My Videos folders , respectively , and also enable you to organize and run the media content they contain . For example , you can sort music by album , artist , or playlist ; and you can have Media Experience show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewer has tools for such tasks as rotating images , displaying thumbnails , and creating slide shows with music . <p> THE PICTURE viewer in Dell 's Media Experience software . <p>
