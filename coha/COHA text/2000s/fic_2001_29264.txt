When the first man woke up that morning , he was n't thinking about killing anyone . He woke up with a head full of blues , a brain that was too big for his skull , and a bladder about to burst . He lay with his eyes closed , breathing across a tongue that tasted like burnt chicken feathers . The blues rolled in through the bedroom door . Coming down hard . He had been flying on cocaine for three days , getting everything done , everything . Then last night , coming down , he 'd stopped at a liquor store for a bottle of Stolichnaya . His bleeding brain retained a picture of himself lifting the bottle off the shelf , and another picture of an argument with the counterman , who did n't want to break a hundred-dollar bill . By that time , the coke high had become unsustainable ; and the Stoli had been a bad idea . There was no smooth landing after a three-day toot , but the vodka turned a wheels-up belly landing into a full crash-and-burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skull and dumped it , he thought , his brain would look like a coagulated lump of Campbell 's bean soup . He cracked his eyes , lifted his head , and looked at the clock . A few minutes past seven . He 'd gotten four hours of sleep . Par for the course with coke , and the Stoli had n't helped . If he 'd stayed down for ten hours , or twelve-he needed about sixteen to catch up-he might have been past the worst of it . Now he was just gon na have to suck it up . He turned to his left , where a woman , a dishwater blonde , lay facedown in her pillow . He could only see about half of her head ; the rest was buried by a red fleece blanket . She lay without moving , like a deadwoman-but no such luck . He closed his eyes again , and there was nothing left in the world but the blues music bumping in from the next room , from the all-blues channel , nine-hundred- and-something on the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Got ta move , he thought . Got ta pee . Got ta take twenty aspirins and go down to Country Kitchen and get some pancakes and link sausages . . . . The man did n't wake up thinking about murder . He woke up thinking about his head and his bladder and a stack of pancakes . Funny how things work out . That night , when he killed two people , he was a little shocked . Green-eyed Alie'e Maison stood in the hulk of a rust-colored Mississippi River barge . She was wrapped in a designer dress that looked like froth over a reef in the Caribbean Sea-an ankle-length dress the exact faded-jade color of her eyes , low-cut and sheer , hugging her hips , flaring at her ankles . She was large-eyed , barefoot , elfin , fleeing down a pale yellow two-by-twelve-inch pine plank , which stretched like a line of fire out of the purple gloom of the barge 's interior . Behind her , a huge man in a sleeveless white T-shirt , filthy Sears , Roebuck work pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wrought iron with an acetylene torch . He was wearing a black dome-shaped welding helmet , and acrid gray smoke curled around his heavy , tense legs . The blank robotic faceplate , in combination with his hairy arms , the dirty shirt , the smoke , and the squat legs , gave him the grotesque crouching power of a gargoyle . A fantasy at three thousand dollars an hour . And not quite right . " That 's no fucking good . NO FUCKING GOOD ! " Amnon Plain moved through the bank of strobes , his thick black hair falling over his forehead , his narrow glasses glittering in the set lights , his voice cutting like a piece of broken glass : " Alie'e , you 're freezing up at the line . I want you blowing out of the place . I want you moving faster when you come up to the line , not slower . You 're slowing down . And I want you to look pissed . You look annoyed , you look petulant- " " I am annoyed-I 'm freezing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of oranges . " Plain turned to an assistant : " Larry , move the heater into the back . You got ta get some heat on her . " " We 'll get the fumes , " Larry said , arms akimbo , a deliberately effeminate pose . Larry was n't gay , just ironic . " We 'll deal with the fucking fumes . Huh ? Okay ? We 'll deal with the fucking fumes . " " You got ta do something . I 'm really cold , " Alie'e said . She clasped her arms around herself and shivered for effect . A man dressed in black walked out from behind the lights , peeling off his cashmere sport coat . He was tall , thin , his over-the-shoulder brunette hair worn loose and back . He had a thick hammered- silver loop earring in his left ear and a dark soul-patch under his lower lip . " Take this until they 're ready again , " he said to Alie'e . She huddled in the coat . Turning away from them , Plain rolled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry shrugged and began wheeling the propane heater farther into the barge . If they all died of carbon monoxide poisoning , it would n't be his fault . Plain turned back to Alie'e . " Jax , take a hike , and take your coat with you . . . . " " Hey- " the man in black said , but nobody was looking at him , or paying attention . Plain continued : " Alie'e , I want you pissed . Do n't do that thing with your lips . You 're sticking your lips out , like this . " Plain pursed his lips . " That 's a pout . I do n't want a pout . Do it like this . . . . " He grimaced , and Alie'e tried to imitate him . This was one of her talents : the ability to imitate expression , the way a dancer could imitate motion . " That 's better , " Plain said to Alie'e . " But make your mouth longer , turn it down , and get it set that way while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it again , making the changes . " That 's good , but now you need some mouth . " He turned back to the line of lights and the small crowd gathered behind them-an account executive , a creative director , a makeup artist , a hairdresser , a couture rep , a second photo assistant , and Alie'es parents , Lynn and Lil . Plain did not provide chairs , and the inside of the barge was not a place you 'd want to sit down , not if your hand-tailored jeans cost four hundred and fifty dollars . To the makeup artist , Plain said , " Fix her mouth . " And to the second assistant : " Jimmy , where 's the fucking Polaroid ? You got the Polaroid ? " Jimmy was fanning a six-by-seven-centimeter Polaroid color print , which was used to check exposure . He glanced at the print and said , " It 's coming up . " Behind him , the creative director whispered to the account executive , " Says ' fuck ' a lot , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plain peered at the Polaroid , looked up at an overhead softbox . " Move that box . About two feet to the right , that way . " Jimmy moved it , and Plain looked around . " Everybody ready ? Alie'e , remember the line . Clark , are you ready ? " The welder said , " Yeah , I 'm ready . Was that enough sparks ? " " Sparks were fine , sparks were good , " Plain said . " You 're the only fucking professional working here this morning . " He looked back at Alie'e . " Now , do n't fucking pout-blow right through the line . . . . " Alie'e waited patiently until her mouth was fixed , staring blankly past the makeup artist 's ear as a bit of color was patched into the left corner of her lower lip ; Jax said into her ear , " Love you . You 're doing great , you look great . " Alie'e barely heard him . She was seeing herself walking the plank , the vision of herself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , she stepped back to her starting mark . Jax got out of the way , and when Plain said , " Go , " Alie'e got her expression right , started down the plank with a lanky , hip-swinging stride , and blew past the exposure line , the green dress swirling about her hips , the orange-yellow welder 's sparks flashing in the background . The stink and smoke of the burning metal curled around her as Plain , standing behind the camera , fired the bank of strobes . " Better , " Plain said , stepping toward her . " A little fuckin ' better . " They 'd been working for two hours in the belly of the grain barge . The barge was a gift : a pilot on the Greek-owned Mississippi towboat Treponema had driven it into a protective abutment around a bridge piling . The damaged barge had been floated to the Anshiser repair yard in St. Paul , where welders cut away the buckled hull plates and prepared to burn on new ones . Plain spotted the disemboweled hulk while scouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniels Midland , the barge owner : Delay repairs for a week , and ADM would make Vogue . The people who ran ADM could n't think of a good reason why the company would worry about Vogue , but their publicity ladies were wetting their pants , so they said okay and the deal was made . They were still working with the green dress when a team from TV3 showed up , and they all took a break . Alie'e goofed around , for the camera , with Jax , showing a little skin , doing a long , slow , rolling tongue-kiss , which the camera crew asked them to redo twice , once as a silhouette . The interviewer for TV3 , a square-jawed ex-jock with bleached teeth and a smile he 'd perfected in his bathroom mirror , said , after the cameras shut down , " It 's a slow day . I think we 'll lead the news with this . " Nobody asked why it was news : they all lived with cameras , and assumed that it was . Two hours for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls of high- saturation Fujichrome film for each of the shots . The Fuji would make the colors pop . Plain pronounced himself satisfied with the green dress , and they moved on . The next pose involved a torn T-shirt and a pair of male-look women 's briefs , complete with the vented front . Alie'e and Jax moved against the far hull and a little shadow , and Alie'e turned her back to the photo crowd and peeled off the green dress . She 'd been nude beneath the dress ; anything else would ruin the line . She was aware of her nudity but not self-conscious about it , as she had been at first . Her first jobs had been as one model in a group , and they usually changed all at once ; she was simply one naked woman among several . By the time she started up the ladder to stardom , to individual attention , she 'd become as conditioned to public nudity as a striptease dancer . Even more than that . She 'd worked in Europe , with the Germans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She remembered the first time she 'd had her pubic hair brushed out , fluffed up . The brusher had been a thirty-something guy who 'd squatted in front of her , smoking a cigarette while he brushed her , and then did a quick trim with a pair of barber scissors , all with the emotional neutrality of a postman sorting letters . Then the photographer came over to take a look , suggested a couple of extra snips . Her body might as well have been an apple . . . . You want privacy ? You turn your back . . . . Alie'e Maison- " Ah-Lee-Ay May-Sone " - had been born Sharon Olson in Burnt River , Minnesota . Until she was seventeen , she 'd lived with her parents and her brother , Tom , in a robin's-egg-blue rambler just off Highway 54 , fourteen miles south of the Canadian line . She was a beautiful-baby . She won a beautiful-baby prize when she was a year old-she 'd been born just before Halloween , and her costume was a pumpkin that her mother made on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a statewide beautiful-toddler trophy . In that one , she 'd been dressed as a lightning bug , in a suit of black and gold . Dance and comportment lessons began when she was three , singing lessons when she was four . At five , she won the North Central Tap-Fairies contest for children five and younger . That was the pattern : Miss Junior North Country , International Miss Snow ( International Falls and Fort Francis , Canada ) , Miss Border Lakes . She sang and danced through her school days . Miss Minnesota and even-her parents , Lynn and Lil , barely dared to dream it-Miss America was possible . Until she was fourteen , anyway . When the breast genes were passed out in heaven , Alie'e had been in line for an extra helping of eyes instead . That became obvious in junior high when her friends began to complain about bra straps cutting into their necks . Not Alie'e . As the Olsons ' best friends , Ellen and Bud Benton , said-Bud said it , anyway- " Ai n't no Miss Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , the breasts did n't matter . In the summer of her sixteenth year , Lynn and Lil took her to a model agency in Minneapolis , and the agent liked what she saw . Alie'e had knife-edge cheekbones and those jade-green eyes . They came straight from God in a perfect package with white-blond hair , a flawless complexion , delicate fuck-me shoulder blades , and hips so narrow she 'd have trouble giving birth to a baling wire . Between Minneapolis and New York , Sharon Olson vanished and Alie'e Maison stepped into her size-six dress . She was so famous that the second-most-famous person in Burnt River was a lawn-care service operator named Louis Friar . Friar , one night in tenth grade , nailed Alie'e in the short grass beside the first-base line of the American Legion baseball diamond on Bergholm Road , on an air mattress that he 'd brought along for that express purpose . Louis never talked about it . He never even confirmed that it happened . He held the memory of the event in a beery reverence . Alie'e , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Burnt River knew about it , and how , at the critical moment , Louis had cried out , " Oh God oh God oh God oh God , " which was why everybody in town called him Reverend . Friar himself thought the nickname was based on his last name , as if the residents of Burnt River were universally fond of puns ; nobody ever told him different . " You do n't think they 're getting too close to porno ? " Lil now asked , under her breath to Lynn , as they watched Amnon Plain push their daughter around the set . " I do n't want any goddamned porno . " Lil had a thing about porno . " You know they 're not going to do any porno , " Lynn said placatingly . He was wearing black-on-black , with wraparound Blades . " They better not . That 'll kill you in a minute . " She refocused . " Look at Jax . I think he 's so good for her . " Jax-he had no last name-was peering around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of himself as a photographer , although he had n't yet taken many photographs . But how hard could it be ? You look through the hole , you push the button . When Alie'e said , " You got anything ? " Jax let the camera drop to his side , tipped his head , and they moved together against the hull of the barge . Jax took a plastic nose-drop bottle from his pocket and passed it to her . Alie'e unscrewed the top , slipped the end into a nostril , and squeezed the bottle once , twice . " Whoa , whoa , " Jax muttered . " Not too much , it 'll kill the eyes . " If you had eyes as green and large as Alie'e 's , you did n't want them dilated . Amnon Plain was moving lights around as his assistants refilled the camera backs with Kodachrome . Alie'e would be wearing a torn pale-blue T-shirt that was meant to show just a hint of rouged nipple within the tear , and the film had to hold the subtlety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torch behind her would n't pop as it would on the Fuji , but that was n't so important in this shot . Plain was juggling the color equities in his mind when Alie'e said , past his head , " Hello , Jael . " Plain turned . His sister was standing in the gash in the barge 's hull , just inside the line of lights . " What do you want ? " He snapped . Jael Corbeau-she 'd changed her name with her mother , after their parents split up-was light where Plain was dark , blond against Plain 's deep brunette . Despite their coloring differences , they had faces that were astonishingly alike , wedge- shaped , edgy , big-eyed . Jael had once been a model herself ; did n't need the money , found the life boring , and moved on . Although the two of them looked alike , there was a singular difference in their faces . Three long pale lines slashed across Jael 's face : scars . She was a lovely woman to begin with , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erotic . Exotic . Something . " I came to see Alie'e , " she said sullenly . " See her someplace else , " Plain said . " We 're trying to work here . " " Do n't give me a hard time , Plain . " " Get the fuck off my shoot , " Plain said , walking toward her . All other talk stopped , and Clark , the welder , stood up , uncertainly , and pushed his mask back . Plain 's voice vibrated with violence . From behind him , Alie'e said , " There 's a party at Silly 's tonight , nine o'clock . " Jael had taken a step back , away from her brother . There was no fear in her , but she did n't doubt that Plain would physically throw her off the barge . He was bigger . " Silly 's at nine , " she said , and left . Plain watched her go , watched until she was out of sight , turned back to Alie'e , took a breath , saw Clark hovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the couture rep and said , " I 've got your key shot . " The couture rep was a thin-faced German named Dieter Kopp . He had a stubble-cut skull , two-day beard , and gaunt , pale face ; his cheeks were lightly pitted , as though he might once have suffered from smallpox . He was the only one not wearing jeans . Instead , he wore a pale gray Italian suit with an open-necked black dress shirt , and a gold tennis bracelet . Kopp did n't want to be in St. Paul , did n't want to be in America . He wanted to be in Vienna , or Berlin , but he was condemned to this : to sell seventy-dollar male-look underpants , complete with front vent , to American women . Like a good German , he would do what was necessary to carry out his orders ; but at the moment , he was still vibrating with the possibility of violence against the striking blonde who 'd just walked off the barge . He knew her face . She 'd been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it for a few years . She looked better now ; she was stunning , he thought . . . . " What ? " He asked . He 'd missed what Plain said to him . " I 've got your key shot . We move Clark around back and we put Alie'e dead center-Alie'e , come over here . " Alie'e walked toward them , along the plank , as Plain continued : " We light them separately and then jam them together with the long lens . Clark will look like the fuckin ' moon coming over the horizon , and Alie'e will be there in the foreground . " " We still need the nipple for the punch , " said the German . " We could lose it with a long lens . " " Got ta lose it anyway for the Americans , " said the creative director , a man with a red beard and a bald , freckled head . " We can do it both ways , " Plain said . " For the Europeans , we 'll hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and light it . Alie'e . . . " Alie'e stepped closer , and Plain slipped his fingers into the torn slit in the T-shirt and pulled it wider , to expose her nipple . " We 'll have to tape this back , we 'll have to bring it out a little more . Maybe touch it with a little more makeup . " " Not too much . She 's really pale , and too much would look artificial , " the art director said nervously . " Artificial would be all right , " Plain said . " What could be sexier than rouged nipples ? " " In Germany , yes , I think , " Kopp said . " In America . . . " " Sexy in America , too , but it 'd be too much for the mainline magazines , " Plain said . " For the American shot , we 'll ice her nipple to bring it up , so you can see it through the T-shirt , put a little shading on the side to emphasize it , but we re-layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snoot . But you 'll still be able to feel it there-there 'll be like a mental tit behind the T- shirt . " " You 're gon na ice me ? " Alie'e asked . " You 're gon na fucking ice me ? It 's twelve degrees in here . " The German had closed his eyes . After a moment , he nodded . Plain had worked for eight years in Miami , where he 'd developed a reputation for a decadent , sexually charged fashion art , juxtaposing outlandishly disparate characters in variations of the Beauty and the Beast theme . Anyone could do that , and many tried , but Plain had something different , something that nobody else could quite get . Something straight out of Grimm 's Fairy Tales . Like this shot . The German could see it in his mind 's eye , now that all the characters were assembled in this ridiculous hulk , with the lights , the smell of the welder , the roaring propane heater . . . But never could have thought of it . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as he did . Plain had vision . They worked the rest of the morning : hard work , done over and over . Plain had a color card in his brain , and a drama chip . He knew what he was getting , and he pushed it . Shredded the T-shirt , exposed one breast completely . Clark watched from the background , a burning torch in his hand , his cement-block sausage lover 's face fixed by the vision of the woman 's body . Lynn and Lil watched from behind the lights : " You do n't think that 's getting toward the porno . . . ? " When they were done , and while Jax was collecting her dressing bags , one of Plain 's assistants walked Alie'e back to a rented Lincoln Towncar . She recovered her purse and the stash of cocaine , caught a little dust under a fingernail , and inhaled . " What do you think of that Clark guy ? " The assistant asked . Alie'e , whose eyes had been closed , the better to experience the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thought about it : " He 's not bad , for a pickup . " " What I meant was , he looked like he had a zucchini stuffed in his pants during that last sequence . " Alie'e smiled her wan , coked-up smile and said , " Then it must have been a good sequence . " Dieter Kopp had seen it ; so had Plain . " I was afraid I 'd lose it . " Plain laughed , brushing the hair back from his eyes . " I was over there waggling that snoot around , trying to get some light on him , hoping it would n't go away , hoping he would n't figure out what I was doing . " " Not for the American magazines , I do n't think ? " Kopp said . But it was a question . " Oh , I think so , " Plain said . " You could n't say anything about it . You could n't make it too obvious . But a little work on the computer , taking it up or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will notice . . . . " Kopp bobbed his head , flashed his thin , hard grin . At another time , he might 've been driving a tank into Russia instead of selling underwear . But that was then , and this was now . He was in underwear . They all went to the party that night , at Silly Hanson 's home : Alie'e , Jax , Plain , Kopp , Corbeau , the photo assistants , Alie'e 's parents , even Clark the welder . Alie'e looked spectacular . She wore the green dress from the photo shoot , and hung with Jael Corbeau and Catherine Kinsley , the heiress , the three women like the three fates in the Renaissance paintings , all tangled together . Techno-pop rolled from small black speakers spotted around Silly Hanson 's public rooms and Alie'e images flashed across movie-aspect flat-screen monitors . The crowd danced and sweated and drank martinis and Rob Roys and came and went . Silly herself got drunk and physical with Dieter Kopp , who left thumb bruises on her breasts and ass . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was astonished to see him . And the killer was there . In the corner , watching .
