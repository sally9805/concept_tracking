A rabbit warren of over four thousand shops , restaurants , public or private rooms . Nothing existed under the sun that you could n't buy or sell under the gold , blue and white tiled arches and painted domes . Turkish carpets , tiles and pottery , copper and brassware , leather apparel , cotton and wool , meerschaum pipes , alabaster book-ends and ashtraysalong with opium harvests and shipments of semiautomatic weapons , if you knew who to talk to . Anything a buyer could want , so long as he had euros or dollars to offer as payment . <p> Though Kapali Carsi was becoming more of a tourist attraction than a local market , amongst the crowded stalls a person could still find Turks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationality . <p> Everyone . And in the streets around the bazaar , the stalls and shops were as crowded . <p> In the daytime , that is . <p> Nathan Galvin was enjoying Istanbul . After twenty days in the city and many walking tours through it , he was feeling very at ease here . He was even using the Turkish he 'd studied for the six months prior to coming here from the United States . He no longer took cabs , preferring to walk or take a tram to get around . He now haggled and never paid full price for anything . And that included food and even the price of his new hotel room . <p> Nathan looked out the tram window at the orange setting sun as it flashed between the buildings . He was dressed in jeans and old sneakers and a gray down jacket that kept out the cutting January wind . With his Mediterranean complexion , short hair and stubble of beard , he knew he did n't look much different than most of the natives . He liked that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat where the locals ate and live the way they did . He wanted to weave himself seamlessly into the tapestry of Istanbul . Simple as that . <p> Nathan picked up his backpack off the floor of the tram and got out at Carsikapi stop . One of the south entrances of the Grand Bazaar loomed ahead of him . It was near sundown . The air was growing colder . He zipped up the jacket to his chin . The smell of spices and kebabs from various restaurants permeated the air . His stomach began to protest in hunger , but he ignored it . The streets were already nearly empty of shoppers and tourists . The storekeepers he passed were beginning to close for the night , taking in the merchandise hanging out on poles for display . <p> He walked up the slight incline to the nearest arched doorway . A group of young men and women who looked to be university students stood at each side of the door , passing out flyers as people made their way out of the bazaar . Nathan noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dark-eyed beauty turned and handed him a flyer . He took it with a nod and looked down at the Turkish words as he entered the bazaar . His command of reading and writing had n't caught up to his conversational Turkish . <p> Inside , the air was much warmer , and Nathan dropped the paper into a nearby barrel . The place was nearly deserted . He had n't been here before at this time of day , but as he walked by the stalls , it occurred to him that he recognized the smells of the place . The scent of wool from rugs stacked up in the nearest shop . The smell of saffron and other spices from the next stall . Each store seemed to offer its own distinct scent . Since arriving in Turkey , he realized , he was so much more attuned to his senses . Smells , tastes , the bright colors . At twenty-three , he did n't think he 'd ever been so aware of these things . <p> The rug seller was pulling sheets of plastic over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him unworthy of his time . <p> Nathan unzipped his jacket and took out a small notebook from his pocket . He stared down at the directions written on it : name , place , time . The shop mentioned was n't one that he 'd visited before , nor did he remember going by it on his other visits to the bazaar . He had some walking to do to get there . <p> He adjusted the backpack on his shoulder and made his way straight into the belly of the building . Following a major concourse , he looked down shop-lined alleys bleeding off to the left and right . Most of the shops this far into the bazaar were already closed , their wooden shutters bolted and the owners gone to their suppers and their hookahs and their tea . Almost no one was going in the direction he was going now . <p> Unexpectedly , a cold sliver of fear slid upward along Nathan 's spine . <p> Shaking it off , he went over in his head what he was supposed to say . Digging his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched the flash drive that he needed to exchange when he arrived at the shop . The instructions were simple . What he needed to say was brief . He 'd practiced it enough times that he could do it in his sleep . Still , he could feel the anxiety building . He was still new at this , and he wanted to be done with the job . There were even fewer people when he took a left down a narrower alley . All the stores were closed , except one near the end . In the darkness beyond it , Nathan could see a closed wooden double door , just large enough for bringing in merchandise . It was barred , and on the other side , he decided , lay one of the alleyways surrounding the bazaar . <p> Two men were talking loudly about soccer as they refilled bins with dried fruit from burlap sacks . <p> Nathan saw someone materialize in the darkness by the door . The man was smoking a cigarette , his eyes intent on Nathan . <p> The cell phone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He knew it would be his parents . He 'd been playing phone tag with them for the past few days . He knew he should n't answer it now . <p> Part of his instructions had been to have no personal items on him today . No cell phone . No passport . Nathan had made an exception with the phone . <p> The phone vibrated again . He actually considered answering it . He glanced at his watch . It was around 8:00 a.m. back on the East Coast in the U.S. There would be no short conversation with them . He could call them after he was done with this job . He noticed that the man by the door had disappeared . Nathan 's parents made the decision for him . The cell phone stopped vibrating . <p> Nathan nodded to the two dried-fruit sellers as he passed them . When he reached the end of the row , he peered in the dim light at the notebook in his hand . He was to turn right and take the next left , where another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging a toddler by the hand behind her was the only person in this stretch of shops . She steered a wide path around Nathan and hurried on . <p> Without the lights of the shops , it was now quite dark . He saw a shadow by the next archway . Nathan thought it must be the same man who 'd been watching him before . Dark leather jacket . The glow of a cigarette cupped in his hand . <p> Nathan 's scalp prickled and he slowed down . He 'd been told this would be a clean , in-and-out job . Simple . A chance for him to meet a local contact . He was sent here alone . It should be easy , but still , doubt nagged at Nathan as he reached the archway . He glanced down at <p> the directions again . He was close to the meeting place . The smell of cigarette smoke hung in the air . The alley ahead was one dark shadow . The man with the cigarette had certainly moved through here only seconds before . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cheek . He looked up . A small window high in the archway was open , and Nathan could see a white moon in the dark sky . It was beautiful . Forcing himself to be calm , he made a mental note to walk by the river before going back to his hotel tonight . Istanbul had its dangers , but it was a civilized city . A city of beauty . Paris of the Middle East . He filled his lungs with the fresh air and made up his mind . He stepped through the arch into the darkness . <p> " Merhaba , " a voice whispered . The man was ahead and to the right . <p> The tip of the cigarette glowed , and Nathan zeroed in on him before stepping forward and repeating the greeting . " Merhaba . " <p> " Nasilsiniz ? " the man asked . How are you ? <p> " Iyiyim , " Nathan answered , suddenly uncomfortable with the small talk . <p> He knew this was n't the final destination . He 'd been told he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nedir ? " Nathan asked . It would n't hurt to ask the other man 's name . He wanted to be sure he had the right person . <p> " Arkada . " <p> Nathan had to repeat the name a couple of times in his head before the meaning dawned on him . It was n't a name . The word meant " friend . " He was saying he was <p> a friend . Nathan stopped a few feet away from him . The man was leaning against the wall . He was wearing a black leather jacket over a dark shirt and black pants . In the darkness , his face was obscured . The cigarette in his hand hung at his side . <p> " Isminiz beneath his boot . He shifted against the wall , and his face came into view . Uncontrollably , Nathan took a half step back . <p> " It is not matter , " the man said in broken English . <p> Nathan stared . The man 's upper lip was marked with a scar that started on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his thick mustache . A short white line from the same cut scarred his lower lip . His black eyes showed nothing . <p> The man 's hand slipped into his jacket pocket and Nathan 's body tensed . <p> " You here want this , " the man said , taking his hand out of the pocket . Within the palm Nathan saw the small flash drive . <p> Nathan nodded , a head jerk intended to be friendly , and pulled the flash drive from his own pocket . <p> " Yes . Everything you need is here . This was easy . " He realized he was speaking too quickly . He never thought the job would go like this . He did n't like it . <p> Nathan extended his hand , holding out the flash drive . He could n't wait to get out of here . <p> At that moment the cell phone came to life again in his pocket . Its soft buzz echoed in the silence of the dark . <p> " Here it is I have to go . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . " Not go . " <p> " It 's nothing . We 've made our  --  " From behind , the hood snapped over his head even as a light flashed brilliantly behind his eyes . Voices murmured for only a moment in muffled Turkish as Nathan felt himself falling from a great height . <p> And the rest was silence <p> NASA Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , California <p> The day the Loma Prieta earthquake rocked the Bay Area in October of 1989 , Alanna Mendes had been working for nasa at Moffett Field for exactly one month . At the very moment the quake began , she was on her way home to Mountain View when the roadway suddenly shuddered and then buckled beneath the shuttle bus . She helped others out of the vehicle , waited with them for rescue vehicles to arrive and eventually made her way home on foot . <p> The next morning , Alanna was on time for work , as she would be every morning for the next nineteen years . Rain , wind , fog , good weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that never changed was Alanna Mendes . She was punctual , precise , dedicated to her job . She was a creature of habit . <p> And after what had happened these past few months , she needed that in her life . <p> Each morning was the same . Leaving her apartment at 6:20 , she would board the shuttle bus one block away at precisely 6:29 . She sat in the second to last seat on the exit-door side of the bus . She said very little to others who got on the bus after her . The shuttle would make one more pickup stop in Mountain View and then four stops at various buildings once it entered the complex of facilities at Moffett Field . She would have between seventeen to nineteen minutes before reaching her destination at Building 23 of the nasa Research Park . Alanna would be at her desk between six forty-five and six-fifty . <p> She liked beginning the day this way . The precision and the predictability of it appealed to the engineer in her . The time on the bus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to immerse herself in work . She loved her job . She was good at it . But doing what she did required a clear head , a focused mind . The commute gave her a chance to shake out the cobwebs and leave her personal life behind . Like every other morning , she spent the minutes going over her schedule for the day on her BlackBerry and reading e-mail that had been sent to her overnight and that she 'd downloaded this morning while her coffee brewed . She took the indispensable electronic device from her bag now . <p> Other nasa workers who rode the bus kept their distance . Her seniority and rank gave her clout , and they all knew what she 'd endured this past fall . Everyone respected her desire for privacy . <p> " Mind if I sit here , Dr. Mendes ? " <br> Continues ...
