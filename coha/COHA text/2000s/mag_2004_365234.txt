Parents may have a new reason to feel good about sending their children to preschool this fall . According to a study in this month 's Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers &; Prevention journal , children who attend day care or nursery school for at least one year before kindergarten are about 36% less likely than those not in preschool to develop Hodgkin 's lymphoma as young adults . The study 's scientists , from the Harvard School of Public Health , Yale University and Johns Hopkins Medical Institute , suggest that early contact with other kids ' germs and exposure to common childhood infections help the immune system mature , making kids less susceptible to this form of cancer later in life . An overall drop in Hodgkin 's in the U.S. in recent years may be due to increased preschool attendance .  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
