The ad that used to challenge " Bet you ca n't eat just one " had your number : That first potato chip inevitably leads to a near-empty bag . It only takes the aroma of cookies baking for your determination to eat fewer sweets to become as soggy as a dunked biscotti . And your resolve to walk three mornings a week was a goner the first time it rained and the urge to snuggle in bed for another half-hour was too powerful to resist . You know what to do to lose weight and be healthy ; you just seem to lack the willpower to do it . However , research reveals that you can train and strengthen your willpower much as you would your muscles . But should you even try ? In some circles , willpower has become almost a dirty word . For example , TV shrink Phil McGraw , Ph.D . ( aka Dr. Phil ) has flatly stated that willpower is a myth and will not help you change anything . According to weight-loss expert Howard J. Rankin , Ph.D. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilton Head , S.C. , and the author of The TOPS Way to Weight Loss ( Hay House , 2004 ) , however , you can learn to resist temptation . But doing so requires meeting it head-on . // At first , that might seem counterintuitive . " Most people think that the only way of dealing with temptation is by avoiding it , but that simply reinforces their powerlessness , " Rankin says . " Self-control and self-discipline are the most important things we need to live an effective life . " Lack of willpower ( or " self-control strength , " as researchers call it ) is implicated in a number of personal and societal problems , agrees Megan Oaten , a doctoral candidate in psychology at Macquarie University in Sydney , Australia , who is conducting cutting-edge studies on self-control . " If you think about the overconsumption of unhealthy foods , lack of exercise , gambling and drugs , then self-control could be one of the most important medicines for our time , " she says . " It 's very positive , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , but you already know you just do n't have much willpower . According to Oaten , there are individual differences in our capacity for self-control , and you may indeed have been born with less potential in this area . But Oaten 's studies have shown that practice levels the playing field . " While we find initial differences in people 's self-control abilities , once they start exercising it the benefits apply equally to all , " she says . If you picture self-control as functioning like a muscle , she adds , " we have a short- and long-term effect from exercising it . " In the short term , your willpower can " hurt " much like your muscles do the first time you subject them to a good workout . This is especially true if you overdo it . Imagine going to the gym for the first time and trying to do a step class , a Spinning class , a Pilates class and a strength-training workout all on the same day ! You might be so sore and tired that you 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your willpower when you make New Year 's resolutions to eat less fat and more fiber , exercise regularly , cut out alcohol , get more sleep , be on time for appointments and write in your journal daily . " With the best intentions , you can overload your self-control strength , and it ca n't possibly cope with all those demands , " Oaten says . " In that case we can predict a failure . " However , if you start out sensibly , taking on one task at a time , pushing through the initial discomfort , improving your performance and sticking with it no matter what , just as a muscle strengthens , so will your willpower . " That 's the long-term effect , " Oaten says . The willpower workout Rankin , who did seminal studies on selfcontrol at the University of London in the 1970s , has devised tried-and-tested exercises that you do sequentially to power up your willpower . " This technique does not require you to do anything you have n't done already , " he says . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it often enough to make a difference , or with the awareness that each time you do it you are strengthening your willpower . The following exercises can help you systematically and mindfully deal with food-related temptations . Step 1 : Visualize yourself resisting temptation . One proven method used by athletes , actors and musicians is visualization . " Visualization is practice , " Rankin says . That 's because you use the same neural pathways to imagine an activity as you do when you actually engage in it . A basketball player , for example , can " practice " making free throws without being on the court . Similarly , by means of visualization you can practice resisting temptation without having food anywhere near you , so there is no risk of giving in to it . " If you ca n't imagine yourself doing something , " Rankin says , " the chance of your actually doing it is pretty remote . " Visualization exercise Find a quiet place , close your eyes and take some deep belly breaths to relax . Now picture yourself successfully resisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is noshing on ice cream while watching television . Imagine that it 's 9:15 p.m. , you 're engrossed in Desperate Housewives , and you become distracted by the carton of Rocky Road in the freezer. see yourself going to the freezer , taking it out , then putting it back without having any . Imagine the whole scenario in detail : The more vivid it is , the more successful it 's likely to be . Always conclude with a positive outcome . Practice until you 're able to do this , then move on to Step 2 . Step 2 : Have close encounters . The key here is to be around foods that tempt you without responding in your usual way . In other words , face temptation but do n't yield to it . " Temptation is out there , " Rankin says , " and it 's empowering to know you can deal with it rather than feeling you 're always walking a tightrope . " Rankin illustrates this concept with a former patient , an obese woman who lived in New York City . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , and each time she 'd eat a croissant or two and a muffin . " So we did the visualization , then went to the bakery , looked in the window and left , " Rankin says . The woman then practiced this by herself a few times . Next , they went together into the bakery , with all its tempting aromas . " We looked at the stuff , then left , " he says . Last , the woman practiced doing that herself , gradually working up to the point that she could sit in the bakery for 15-20 minutes and just have coffee . " She wrote to me a year or so later and said she had lost 100 pounds , " Rankin says . " This was the pivotal technique that made her feel she had some control . " Close-encounter exercise Try the same procedure with any food that customarily is your downfall . Enlist the help of a supportive friend , as in the example above . When you can successfully be alone around a " binge food " without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 : Take a taste test . This exercise involves eating a small amount of your favorite food , then stopping . Why subject yourself to that kind of temptation ? Many people claim they can occasionally indulge in something without getting out of control , Rankin explains . " You need to know if you really can do that or if you are deluding yourself . " There may be some foods that you should avoid completely . If , in fact , you ca n't ever " eat just one , " then use the first two steps to train yourself not to eat that first one at all . On the other hand , it 's extremely encouraging to discover that you can stop after a couple of spoonfuls of chocolate mousse . Taste-test exercise Try having a bite of cake at a birthday party or just one of your co-worker 's cookies . Take advantage of whatever opportunities arise . " It 's up to any one person on any one day to tackle what they feel they can manage , " Rankin says . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible today . The important point is to successfully do it enough times to strengthen your willpower by flexing it . " Experiencing good results with food can give you confidence to try the technique with other behaviors , like quitting smoking or starting to exercise ( see " Will Yourself to Work Out , " at right ) . As Rankin says , " Whenever you successfully resist temptation , you are developing self-control . " // will yourself to work out The same techniques that can help you learn to resist your favorite binge foods can help you build your will to exercise . Visualize exercising . Picture yourself lacing up your walking shoes or putting on your workout clothes . Now imagine the sensation of striding along with the fresh air on your skin : Picture the route , the sights and the people you 'll encounter . If it 's more appealing , feel yourself gently working your muscles in a stretch or yoga class . Have close encounters . Wear your workout clothes around the house until you feel at ease in them . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without working out until you feel comfortable and get inspired by observing people who are exercising there . According to weight-loss expert Howard J. Rankin , Ph.D. , what we see others doing is perhaps the biggest influence on our behavior . Take a " taste test . " Pick an activity you think you 'll enjoy and commit to trying it for 10 minutes . Progress to making longer " exercise dates " with yourself , and mark them on your calendar . The more dates you keep , the more you will be strengthening your willpower to do longer and more freguent workouts . Sidebar You can turn weak , underutilized self-control into strong , tough resolve that will help you meet your fitness and weight-loss goals . Sidebar how willpower spills over You might find that mastering self-control in one area of your life affects others , so that you achieve other goals without even focusing on them . In an Australian study , people who had n't taken part in any regular physical activity for at least 12 months undertook to discipline themselves to exercise regularly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoking and alcohol consumption . But healthy eating , emotional control , maintenance of household chores , adherence to commitments , monitoring of spending and improvements in study habits increased .
