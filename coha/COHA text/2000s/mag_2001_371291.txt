For a family whose patriarch once spoke of it dismissively , the Bushes have developed a thing for vision . In September 1990 , a few weeks after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait , President George H.W. Bush told Congress that " out of these troubled times , our objective  --  a new world order  --  can emerge . " For the next year or so , he trotted out that phrase times without number . The new world order , he said at one point , implied " new ways of working with other nations ... peaceful settlement of disputes , solidarity against aggression ... and just treatment of all peoples . " <P> George W. Bush has his own version of the vision , though some might say it 's even gauzier than Dad 's . When meeting with reporters in the Oval Office on Sept. 13 , the President said , " Through the tears and sadness , I see an opportunity . " Since then , he has continually used the line  --  both in public and in private talks with other leaders  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the State Department , Bush noted the chance " to make the world a better place for generations to come " and to " spread goodwill around the world . " <P> Who would n't like that ? But the President 's advisers know there is a huge gap between his fond wishes and their possible fulfillment . Some of them have a memory . By the time of the 1992 election , " the new world order " had become mere evidence of the hubris of a President who seemed awed by the scanner at a supermarket checkout . " We had this problem in the early ' 90s , " said a State Department official last week . " You know  --  ' It 's a new world , we can do everything . ' Our rhetoric was way ahead of where it should be . " <P> Fair enough ; ungrounded rhetoric does little good . But if the Administration is really determined to win the war against terrorism , vision is n't optional . In the next few months , as the U.S. takes military action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's easy to see what might be done to help a shooting war 's victims  --  food aid , support for refugees , immediate economic assistance . <P> But such goodwill measures wo n't achieve Bush 's avowed goal , the elimination of terrorism . Nothing can deliver that , for there have always been political and religious fanatics in the world and always will be . A more grounded vision  --  less rhetorically satisfying but perhaps attainable  --  would be to drastically reduce the support that terrorists receive from the general population , for whom resentment of the U.S. and its friends becomes a reason to excuse those who translate ill will into violent rage . <P> In reaching for that goal , the U.S. has to take into account a number of factors . They include : <P>  --  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . Since the end of the Gulf War , India and Pakistan have tested nuclear bombs , Iran has continually sought to acquire nuclear technology , and Iraq would dearly love to . <P>  --  Deadlock in the Middle East peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups and Israel . <P>  --  The continuation of repressive autocracies , often dynastic , in the Middle East  --  including countries that Washington regards as its " moderate " friends  --  that seal off safety valves for political dissent .
