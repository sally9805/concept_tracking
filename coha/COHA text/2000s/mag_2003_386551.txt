A robust 78 , one of the greatest drummers of all time still riffs up a storm and wows fellow musicians <p> YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD of Roy Haynes , but you have almost certainly heard him . In nearly 60 years as a jazz drummer , Haynes has appeared on some 600 recordings , many of them classics . With Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie on 1951 's stirring " Night in Tunisia , " that 's Haynes popping the drums , cymbals and metal rims . With Sarah Vaughan on " He 's My Guy , " Haynes ' nimble swing complements her satiny voice . With Thelonious Monk on " ' Round Midnight , " with John Coltrane on " Dear Old Stockholm , " with Lester Young , Bud Powell , Miles Davis , Stan Getz , Ray Charles and Chick Corea  --  on one historic recording after another , Haynes propels the music with an incomparable blend of spontaneous expression and sympathetic restraint . He is the " father of modern drumming , " says the guitarist Pat Metheny . Haynes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But he 's no relic . Now 78 , Haynes has averaged more than 50 live performances a year over the past three years , playing in Paris , Rome , Tokyo , Istanbul , Madrid and many U.S. cities . He released a new compact disc this year , Love Letters , which Village Voice critic Gary Giddins described as " borderline miraculous , " marked by " heedless joy " and " unbridled enthusiasm . " Even Haynes is a bit surprised by all his energy " When I was in my 20s , " he tells me , " I could n't even imagine that I 'd be 78 years old and still plating , performing and innovating like this . I read something recently where somebody said I was pushing 80 years old . I stepped back and said , 80 ? It 's hard for me to believe . " <p> Though Haynes has played with legends , and their music was often revolutionary , he remains largely unknown outside the jazz community . That is partly because of America 's curious taste for celebrities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history emphasizes stars and frontmen and overlooks sidemen , especially drummers and bassists . Then there 's the appealing myth of the solitary artist , which Haynes does not fit . He may play in four-limbed flurries with more activity and intricacy than any drummer before him , but his real art is communication . " The thing that sets Roy apart from other musicians is that he listens so well , " says the pianist McCoy Tyner , who played with Haynes in bands led by Coltrane in the early 1960s . " He teaches you to listen carefully and to respond accordingly , to put things in perspective , not to simply go out for yourself . He can do this in a quiet fashion accompanying singers or with those loose , powerful polyrhythms of his that are so magnificent . " <p> These days Haynes works primarily with two bands . One has stars in their 30s and 40s such as trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Nicholas Payton , bassist Christian McBride and saxophonist Kenny Garrett . The other has four up-and-comers in their 20s . One night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a blistering version of the Parker tune " Diverse , " Haynes staggered up to the microphone in a faux daze . " Daaaaaamn ! " he exclaimed to the cheering crowd . " These guys are hot , are n't they ? " The musicians grinned . Haynes pointed to a wall-size poster of Parker ( who died in 1955 at age 34 ) behind the stage and said , " You know , if Charlie Parker were to walk into this club right now and see me here playing with these guys who are 50 years younger than me , I think he 'd smile . He 'd dig it . " <p> Haynes , who has a shaved head and is not tall , has the lean , muscular body of a flyweight boxer and looks decades younger than he is . When he walks , he springs forward on his toes , and standing or sitting , he sways , shifts and squirms , restless as a kid . His laugh is robust and warm , and his mind is quick and can be challenging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drove Haynes in our rented Taurus from Albany , New York , to a jazz festival 30 miles away in Saratoga Springs , where he would perform . Hendon , a New York City attorney who does n't usually hang out with musicians , attempted small talk while we were loading the car , asking Haynes if he 'd remembered to bring his drumsticks . Haynes seemed flabbergasted : " What ? Do I have my drumsticks ? What do you mean ? Would a painter forget his paintbrushes ? I do n't understand ? " He muttered in mock disgust at his decision to ride with us , and for the next half-hour ribbed Hendon . " Jeez , man , come on , ca n't you come up with anything better than that ? Did I remember my drumsticks ? " Finally , Hendon blurted out , " Look , man , rookie mistake ! " Haynes roared with laughter , satisfied that he 'd at last provoked an honest expression . <p> That night , after Haynes walked off the stage to a standing ovation , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " he said with a wide grin . <p> Haynes ' directness is of a piece with his art . " Roy stays on the edge and that keeps him young , " says bassist Ed Howard , 43 , who played with Haynes for 15 years until 1997 . " He never lets up . He 's always pushing boundaries , challenging you , living in the moment . He changes you musically and personally He strips away your self-consciousness and makes you comfortable with possible embarrassment . He prepares you for anything that might happen . Some nights onstage he 'll just take the microphone and give it to you and tell you to talk to the audience . You have to always be on alert . " <p> Haynes is one of the few musicians still performing whose origins touch the very roots of jazz . Growing up in the Boston area , he played in bands as a teenager before landing his first major gig in 1945 at age 20 , in New York City , with Luis Russell 's big band . Russell had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Louis Armstrong in the 1930s . " Luis seemed impressed , and he believed in me , " says Haynes . " I 'll never forget one thing he told me . He said , Anytime you get lost , just roll . ' That 's when I learned there is n't a definite time with the music , just space . You did n't have to play only time signatures , you did n't have to hit the high-hat cymbals on two 's and four 's every time . You could be looser with the rhythms . But I also learned you had to have control and swing . Luis had a 17- , 18-piece band , and I had to have control to keep the band together . " <p> Roy Owen Haynes was born in the Roxbury section of Boston in 1925 , the third of Gustavus and Edna Haynes ' four children , all sons . His parents had moved to the area from Barbados in the West Indies . His father worked for Standard Oil Company and liked to tinker with cars . His mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music in the house on Sundays . Haynes ' oldest brother , Douglas , served in the U.S. Army in World War II and died less than a decade after coming home . Another older brother , Vincent , who was a photographer , football coach and civic leader in Roxbury , died this past June at age 82 . Haynes ' surviving brother , Michael , 76 , has been senior minister at Roxbury 's landmark Twelfth Baptist Church since 1964 and served three terms in the Massachusetts state legislature . <p> Haynes was introduced to music early " My father sang in a choir and played organ , " he says . " We had an organ in our house when I was growing up . As a kid I was banging on everything around the house until I got a set of drums . I also studied violin , but I was a natural drummer , as they said in those days . My older brother Douglas was not a professional musician , but he was a student of music and he knew a lot of musicians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calloway , who was Cab Calloway 's sister . " Douglas introduced Haynes to one of his heroes , Count Basie 's drummer Jo Jones , when he was still a teenager . " Jo 's drums on the Basie record The World is Mad turned me on . When I heard it , I really knew that 's what I wanted to do . " <p> In 1947 , at 22 , Haynes left Russell 's band and moved on to legendary saxophonist Lester Young ; after two years , he briefly played with Bud Powell and also Miles Davis before joining up with Charlie " Bird " Parker , with whom he played for three years . " Roy was different , " saxophonist Sonny Rollins , 73 , recalls of the early years . " He was able to accompany Parker in the most wonderful way He had his own sound and his own methods . I remember one night in particular when they were opening at some place in Greenwich Village opposite Art Tatum . It was the great Charlie Parker and the great Art Tatum on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was at the Car Society in 1950 , " he says , adding : " Billie Holiday sat in with us . Ray Bolger was there and sat in with us too . He was the Broadway dancer who played the Scarecrow in the movie The Wizard of Oz . He performed a few soft-shoe numbers while we played . Can you imagine ? " <p> Those were jazz 's golden years , before rock ' n ' roll and rhythm and blues splintered the audience , a period of constant innovation that gave rise to , among other things , bebop . Haynes was in the forefront . Traditionally , jazz drummers had been relegated to rote timekeeping  --  **28;1096;TOOLONG . But Haynes , along with other drum pioneers such as Jo Jones , Sid Catlett , Kenny Clarke and Max Roach , helped free the drums . Haynes extracted the rhythmic qualities from melodies and created new drum and cymbal patterns  --  **42;1126;TOOLONG . Rather than using the cymbals as mere decorative accents , Haynes made them central to his rhythmic approach . His unique sound earned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late 1940s and early ' 50s  --  heard on tunes such as Lester Young 's " Ding Dong , " Parker 's " Anthropology , " Powell 's " Bouncing with Bud " and Davis ' " Morpheus "  --  inspired a generation or two of artists . " Roy may have been the first avant-garde jazz musician , in terms of his freedom with the rhythms , " says the drummer Billy Hart , 63 . " He was so far in the future , way ahead of his time , but he was natural and traditionally grounded too . " <p> A measure of Haynes ' free-spiritedness is that in 1952 he turned down the drum chair in Duke Ellington 's band , perhaps the most influential jazz orchestra in history " I was with Bird and we 'd just finished playing a concert at Carnegie Hall , which was a double bill with Duke . I was living in the President Hotel on 48th Street , and Duke called me there . We just talked about a lot of things , my music , his music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I knew that if I went with Duke 's band , there would have been some problems with some of the older members who were n't so hip to the new thing . Duke himself could deal with it , I 'm sure , or else he would n't have wanted me . <p> " From then on , " Haynes continues , " I would run into Duke at different parties and restaurants , and he would always remind me that I did n't join his band . He would make a joke of it . I thought it was so beautiful that he would do that . I remember one time I saw him in Washington , D.C. back during the Johnson administration . One of Johnson 's secretaries was into jazz , and she would have these parties at her house . One night I was arriving at a party as Duke was leaving , and he mentioned it then too  --  that I did n't join his band . It must have been nearly 20 years later . So , that respect and that love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thing , even though , you know , I was n't . " <p> Haynes joined Sarah Vaughan 's band in 1953 and stayed with her for five years . An expressive musician can sometimes be stymied accompanying a singer , but Haynes fine-tuned his improvisations . " Sarah sang the slowest ballads of any singer , so I had to be patient , " says Haynes . " But I also love lyrics and I love beautiful melodies , so I enjoyed listening to her while I was playing . " Haynes ' work on Vaughan 's classic 1954 albums Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown and Swingin ' Easy are masterpieces of complementary drumming . " The first thing Roy gives you is a sense of taste , " Tyner says . " Even when he 's giving you those loose , free rhythms that are so extraordinary , he 's still listening to you and being tasteful and lyrical . It 's awfully hard to describe how he achieves that balance , but I would n't be surprised if he learned how to do it while he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Haynes bought a duplex in Hollis , Long Island , where he and his wife , Jesse Lee Nevels Haynes , raised two sons and a daughter . All three , now grown , still live in that same duplex with their respective families . ( Haynes moved to another home on Long Island after his wife died in 1979 . He has not remarried . ) The middle-class nature of Haynes ' family , like that of his parents , disavows the stereotype of the tumultuous , dissipated , often tragic lifestyle that is so much a part of jazz mythology . <p> But Haynes has been one of the hippest cats in the suburbs . From his father he inherited a taste for fine cars and custom-made clothes . Today , he owns a 1974 Brickland , a 1990 custom El Dorado , a 1998 E1 Dorado and a 2001 CL 500 Mercedes Benz . " My first car was a convertible Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight that I bought in the early 1950s at the same time Miles Davis bought his first car , which was a Dodge convertible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race our cars through Central Park at night with our tops down . I remember Miles used to tell girls "  --  he mimics Davis ' famous hoarse whisper  --  " ' Me and Roy Haynes , we like to race around Central Park smashing up our cars . ' It was a wild , hip time . " In 1960 , Esquire ranked Haynes as one of the best-dressed men in America , along with Fred Astaire , Clark Gable and Cary Grant . <p> Haynes left Vaughan 's band in 1958 , and his work over the next decade was documented on dozens of influential recordings . By now , he had mostly dispensed with bar lines  --  the musical measurements that dictate a song 's structure  --  and interacted with his band mates even more freely Previously , drummers generally waited until the end of 16 bars to play a " fill , " a pattern of drum figures . But Haynes would put a fill anywhere . " Before Roy , you could always distinctly hear the break when a drummer switched from keeping time to improvising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor Lewis , 53 . " Roy blurred the border . It was revolutionary . To be able to play as freely as Roy without disrupting the flow  --  while actually swinging like hell  --  is walking a fine line . He found a way to do it better than anybody else . " <p> Another uncanny Haynes feat is to project his sound without being loud . His percussion seems to well up from all corners of a room . That may be difficult or impossible to hear on recordings , but seldom fails to impress musicians who share the band- stand with him or hear him live . " What Roy has as a musician is a very , very special thing , " says drummer Jack DeJohnette , 61 . " The way he tunes his drums , the projection he gets out of his drums , the way he interacts with musicians onstage : it 's a rare combination of street education , high sophistication and soul . " <p> As it is with many innovators , the initial reception to Haynes was mixed . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monk at the Five Spot Care in Manhattan , saxophonist Johnny Griffin took Coltrane 's place in the band . Griffin , who would move to Europe in 1963 , remembers his first time playing with Haynes . " The band was cookin ' , but Roy was busier than most drummers back then , and I was n't used to it , " Griffin , 75 , says on the phone from his home in France . " Coming off the stage one night , I said to Thelonious , ' Man , your drummer here , doing that **27;1170;TOOLONG , do n't you think your drummer is a little bit too busy back there ? ' Thelonious just looked at me . Then he finally said , ' Hmmmmm , if you do n't like it , you talk to him yourself . ' " <p> " I went out back and found Roy , " Griffin goes on . " I said , ' Roy , man , you know , this **27;1199;TOOLONG . Do n't you think you might be just a bit too busy , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went off . He said , ' Why , I played with Charlie Parker , I played with Lester Young , I played with Bud Powell , I played with Sarah Vaughan , I played with all these cats and nobody ever complained about my playing . ' I said , ' I 'm sorry , Roy . Please forget I said anything . ' " A few nights later , Monk , Griffin , bassist Ahmed Abdul Malik and Haynes were in the kitchen in between sets , and Monk , an oracular figure known in the jazz world as a man of few words , revisited the subject . " Thelonious started rubbing his chin whiskers like he was going to say something , " Griffin recalls . " He sat back and kept rubbing his whiskers . Then , he said , ' Hmmmm , Johnny Griffin ai n't scared of Roy Haynes . ' That 's all he said . We all looked around at each other . Then , we all broke out hysterically laughing . It was the funniest thing . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized how wonderful it was , " Griffin says . " He was completely different from anybody else . The slightest idea of anything on the bandstand would set him off on a different rhythmic and percussive course , but he always swung so damn hard . It was quite beautiful , and Thelonious loved it . He would say ; ' Roy is like an eight ball right in the side pocket . ' " <p> " Haynes defines the Monk experience , " says Hart , recalling the live recordings that Haynes made in Monk 's band ( with Griffin ) in 1958 , released as Monk 's albums Misterioso and Thelonious in Action . " He shared Monk 's vision for both tradition and originality . Roy 's improvisations on those records are true genius , so lyrical , so melodic , but also so advanced . It 's like he could see into the future . If you take the music he made with Monk and add the music he made with Coltrane and Chick Corea in the 1960s , you 've got the whole range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy Haynes . That much genius ... it 's hard to imagine . I normally do n't talk like this , but I mean every word of it . " <p> HAYNES ' INFLUENCE has reverberated through several generations of drummers . The novelties that confounded Johnny Griffin nearly five decades ago have been rubbed smooth by familiarity . The marvel is that the septuagenarian Haynes still wows cutting-edge musicians . In 1997 , he cut short a vacation in Barbados to fill in for Tony Williams nine days after Williams died at age 51 . The gig , slated for the Catalina Bar &; Grill in Los Angeles , was going to be canceled . But when Haynes agreed to fill in , the trio 's other members , pianist Mulgrew Miller and bassist Ira Coleman , decided to play . <p> Jim Keltner , an L.A. session drummer for 35 years , attended the performance with Charlie Watts , drummer for the Rolling Stones . " Charlie and I could not believe our eyes and ears , " says Keltner , 61 . " It was magical . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't playing the high-hat at all , . . . just playing ride cymbal and snare drum . It was so free , so mesmerizing , just watching him be so loose and relaxed . I 'd never heard a trio play like that in my life . You wish that people who do n't know anything about jazz had been there . It was very powerful . " <p> " It was one of the greatest musical experiences of my life , " says Miller , 48 . " I had never played with Roy before , and I was a little apprehensive , but after the first eight bars of the first tune I just smiled and said to myself , ' This is going to be all right . ' " Coleman , 47 , adds : " It felt like we were dancing up there . I 'll never forget how visually present Roy was . He kept constant eye contact with us , as opposed to a lot of other players who close their eyes or sink into themselves . He was looking at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I am listening to you , I hear you . ' " <p> ROY HAYNES is receiving some of the acclaim due him from a wider audience . In 2002 , he was honored with two nights of tribute concerts at Lincoln Center in New York City . This past March , Haynes ' 78th birthday bash was held at the Blue Note , the famed Manhattan jazz club . Flowers and gifts filled his dressing room . Many notables showed up  --  pianist Cecil Taylor , drummer Andrew Cyrille , saxophonist Joe Lovano . Also present were Haynes ' grown children : Graham , a cornetist , Craig , a drummer , and Leslie Haynes Gilmore , a legal secretary . Her son , Marcus Gilmore , then 16 , played a drum solo as his grandfather stood offstage smiling proudly " That was my best birthday present , " Haynes says . <p> Musically and physically , Haynes seems to resist the passage of time . Backstage at the jazz festival in Saratoga Springs , singer Cassandra Wilson quizzed him about his diet and exercise habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Haynes , sporting a visor and dark sunglasses , only mentioned a ten-speed bicycle that he rides " once in a while . " <p> When I ask Haynes about his music , he is hardly more forthcoming . " My music grows , but it does n't change , " he says . " I try to find ways to sort of fit the atmosphere whenever I am playing . To me , music is music . I go by the feeling of what I enjoy and what I like to do . I try to stay fresh . When leaves come out on the trees each season , they are new leaves . They are the same leaves , but they are really not . " Haynes pauses . " That 's all I 'll say . I 'm not the kind of person who likes to analyze , analyze , analyze . I mean , you are sitting here with a guy who has been playing this music for 60 years . Man , that 's something , you know ? " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general looking over a field , " jazz critic Giddins writes of Haynes ( in Chicago last year ) .
