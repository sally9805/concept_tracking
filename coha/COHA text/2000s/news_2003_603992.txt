This leaves a nation stuck on hold . And perhaps nothing is stuck deeper in a psychological rut than the economy . <p> So stuck that folks are putting off buying those shiny SUVs they 've been so eager to see in their driveways . So stuck that even a $ 318 US Airways round trip to Ireland from Baltimore is getting as much interest as week-old Irish stew . So stuck that rooms at the Ramada Inn Mirage in St. Petersburg , Fla.  --  heated pool and all  --  can be had for $ 42 a night . <p> It 's almost as if a cosmic pot of emotional glue has spilled and gummed things up from coast to coast .

" We do n't know if war will be over in three days or if we 'll be paying the price for the next two generations . " <p> Perhaps no industry has been hit harder by war anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel will drop 8% this year and that airlines face $ 11 billion in losses . <p> Even Mickey Mouse is feeling the squeeze .
