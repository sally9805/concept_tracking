How big business is quietly funding a legal revolution <p> LIKE MANY of President 's Bush 's lower-court nominees , William H. Pryor Jr . has had a hand in just about every legal social theory that drives Senate Democrats to outrage . As the attorney general of Alabama , he pushed for the execution of the mentally retarded , compared homosexuality to bestiality , defended the posting of Bible quotes at the courthouse door , and advocated rescinding a portion of the Voting Rights Act . He called Roe v. Wade " the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history . " <p> So when Pryor , a boyish 41-year-old , came before the Judiciary Committee in June wearing a carefully folded kerchief in his pin-striped suit , opposing senators clashed over whether such views disqualified him from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals . Republicans , led by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch , praised Pryor 's distinguished career , his numerous awards , and the hundreds of letters supporting his nomination . They tossed him softball questions about his " mainstream " approach to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pryor 's conservative social stands . Did n't it matter that he had once canceled a family vacation to Disney World to avoid a gay and lesbian event ? Could someone who blamed the Supreme Court for " the slaughter of millions " fairly interpret the law ? Did the only state attorney general to challenge the Violence Against Women Act deserve a lifetime appointment ? " I do n't understand , looking at your record , how one can conclude that you do n't have an agenda , " said Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy , leading the Democratic attack . It was a classic confrontation , one that has been repeated again and again with President Bush 's judicial nominees . <p> But it also obscured the most important factor in Pryor 's swift rise from Mobile , Alabama , to the national stage : his longtime courting of corporate America . " The business community must be engaged heavily in the election process as it affects legal and judicial offices , " Pryor told business leaders in 1999 , after refusing to join other attorneys general in lawsuits against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pryor created a controversial group called the Republican Attorneys General Association , which skirted campaign-finance laws by allowing corporations to give unlimited checks anonymously to support the campaigns of Pryor and other " conservative and free market oriented Attorneys General . " <p> With such activism , Pryor positioned himself in the vanguard of a stealth campaign by American business to change the way that state and federal law is interpreted . Since 1998 , major corporations  --  Home Depot , Wal-Mart , and the insurance giant AIG , to name a few  --  have spent more than $100 million through front groups to remake courts that have long been a refuge for wronged consumers and employees . By targeting incumbent judges , they have tilted state supreme courts to pro-business majorities and ousted aggressive attorneys general . At the same time , corporate lobbyists have blitzed state legislators with tort-reform proposals , overseeing the passage of new laws in 24 states over the past year alone . <p> Now , with a sympathetic ear in the White House , corporate America is taking its legal agenda to the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising . Pryor is just one of the corporate stars . Several of President Bush 's nominees to federal appeals and district courts  --  and even White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales , a former Texas Supreme Court justice who now selects federal nominees for the president  --  owe their careers to the support of the insurance , retail , and energy industries that got them elected on the state level . <p> The nominees ' legal approaches have been nurtured by a string of corporate foundations that fund university programs and ideological groups like the Federalist Society . And their promotion to the federal bench coincides with an ambitious corporate legislative agenda , backed by more than 475 lobbyists , that seeks to force limits on jury awards and move lawsuits out of state courts , where judges historically have favored plaintiffs . In Congress , the House Majority Leader , Rep. Tom DeLay , has formed a working group on " judicial accountability " to push for the approval of the president 's nominees and launch investigations of liberal federal judges . " What you have is a wholesale effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durbin , an Illinois Democrat and former corporate defense lawyer . " They clearly want to put in a more conservative judiciary and then start stacking the deck by removing more and more cases to the federal courts . " <p> So far , the public debate has all but ignored this quiet corporate campaign . Unlike high-visibility battles over abortion , the death penalty , or gay rights , the legal fights over tort reform , regulatory powers , anti-trust law , and property rights do not lend themselves to easy explanations in news stories . In Beltway parlance , such issues " translate poorly " to voters  --  a fact that has not been lost on conservative activists . " Because of the smoke and fire of the abortion issue , it is probably all anybody will talk about , but there is much more at stake , " says Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform . His group , which receives funding from corporate and conservative foundations , has organized resolutions in at least 10 state legislatures supporting Bush 's judicial nominees . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It does n't understand money . " <p> Big money , however , cares a great deal about who sits on the nation 's 13 federal circuit courts . " There is the hope on the part of the business community that their rulings will be more friendly , " says Paul DeCamp , a Republican corporate lawyer who counts two nominees as personal friends . " The Supreme Court ca n't decide every case . " In fact , circuit courts are the final venue for 99 percent of federal cases and most regulatory challenges . These courts , which operate in relative media obscurity , are not likely to make final decisions about high-profile social issues , such as gay marriage or the death penalty , which end up at the Supreme Court . Rather , they set precedent on issues affecting business such as media-ownership rules , sport-utility rollover lawsuits , or the rights of coal-mining companies to dump waste in thousands of miles of streambed in West Virginia . " There are many cases in which a circuit court nominee 's views matter , but abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who leads Public Citizen 's litigation group . " There are just a hundred different ways by which the courts of appeals judges can by little cuts kill plaintiffs . " <p> Years of delaying President Clinton 's nominees to these same courts left the Bush administration , and the business community , with a golden opportunity : All but two of the nation 's 13 federal circuits  --  evenly divided between Democratic and Republican appointees under Clinton  --  could have Republican majorities by the next election . " With this four-year crop , it 's really going to be a different judiciary than it is now , " says Eldie Acheson , who led judge selection for Clinton 's Justice Department . <p> The stated goal of many of these business groups is not a modest one : to chip away at more than 60 years of legal history , dismantle federal social services , and effectively erase the policies of the Franklin Roosevelt era . " We 've been living since the New Deal with an essentially unconstitutional government , " says Roger Pilon , director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new generation of young conservative and libertarian lawyers being elevated to federal courts , he adds , " are not afraid to say that . " <p> PRYOR POSITIONED HIMSELF early to win the favor of the business community . As far back as 1998 , he announced that Alabama would not join lawsuits against the tobacco and gun industries . He urged federal courts to roll back the Clean Water Act , testified before Congress against the Clean Air Act , and argued for gutting federal protections of disabled workers on constitutional grounds . Such views allowed him to rake in business contributions . Pryor 's 2002 re-election campaign eventually received $100,000 of legally laundered cash from the Republican Attorneys General Association , a group that attracted companies as far-ranging as Microsoft , Eli Lilly , Anheuser-Busch , and Philip Morris . The money contributed to a 3 to 1 fundraising advantage Pryor built over his Democratic challenger , whom he defeated in a landslide . <p> Pryor never identified the source of this war chest . But recently leaked documents show he knew at the time that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of Alabama 's citizens . According to phone records , he personally solicited funds for the Republican Attorneys General Association from executives at R.J. Reynolds , Philip Morris , and other Fortune 500 companies . The National Rifle Association , clearly pleased by his refusal to sue gun makers , also contributed to the fund after Pryor called for a donation , the phone records show . The undisclosed checks for up to $25,000 got lobbyists invitations to shoot skeet , play golf , and enjoy a " stress-relief spa " with Republican attorneys general . The potential for ethical conflicts was too potent for several of Pryor 's Republican peers . Betty Montgomery , Ohio 's attorney general , went so far as to pull out of the organization , telling a local newspaper , " I raised some questions about who we were raising money from . " <p> Pryor was not the pioneer of this kind of fundraising . The strategy of using vast amounts of campaign cash to shift the legal landscape was developed a decade earlier by a talented young Republican direct-mail consultant from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moniker of " Bush 's brain , " Rove realized he could energize the legal and medical establishments by targeting the once-sleepy Texas Supreme Court elections . " Karl has always had the requisite skills , but the proving ground came in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " said Kim Ross , a former chief lobbyist for the Texas Medical Association , who worked closely with Rove . " Karl was talking about how business and medicine had to pull this together on the tort thing . " <p> The conflicts this created were on full display in the case of Priscilla Owen , now a Bush nominee to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals . When she first decided in the early 1990s that she wanted to run for a spot on the Texas Supreme Court , she called on Ralph Wayne , president of the Texas Civil Justice League , a trade group formed by the state 's manufacturing , transportation , and energy industries . " I said , ' Have you talked to Karl Rove ? ' " Wayne remembers . " She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " <p> After Rove met with Wayne and Owen , he signed on , giving the candidate the seal of approval from the state 's corporate establishment . The money followed . Owen raised $1.1 million for her successful 1994 state Supreme Court campaign , with a record 21 percent coming directly from the business community and much more coming from corporate defense lawyers . Judge Owen later repaid the favor , in part , by lending her endorsement to a Texas Civil Justice League fundraising appeal . <p> By the time Rove was done , the last Democrat had been purged from the Texas Supreme Court . " The cases all started getting decided anti-consumer , on the side of big business , " says Phil Hardberger , a retired Texas appellate court judge who is a Democrat . Jury verdicts , once embraced by the Democratic court , were now overturned or reduced . By the 1997-98 term , defendants were winning 69 percent of the time , and insurance companies , doctors , and pharmaceutical firms were winning nearly every case . Owen consistently distinguished herself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one decision , Owen argued unsuccessfully in support of a water-quality exemption tailored for an Austin land developer who had given $2,500 to her campaign . The court majority dismissed her contention as " nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric . " <p> The success of the Texas campaign was contagious . Soon the business community in other states , and nationally , began to invest in judicial battles , shifting the ideological majorities in Idaho , Michigan , Pennsylvania , and Alabama . The U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined with the Business Roundtable to set up a complex network of front groups that anonymously filtered corporate money into often divisive local television ad campaigns . By 2000 , campaign spending on state judicial races had risen to $45.6 million , a 61 percent increase over the previous peak in 1998 and twice as much as 1994 . The Chamber claimed victory in 21 of 24 judicial elections it worked on in eight states , as well as 11 attorneys general races . " I was an exporter of judicial terrorism , " explains Ross of the Texas Medical Association . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life of its own . " <p> Those familiar with Rove 's operation in Texas now see the same strategy at work in the White House 's selection of federal judges . In addition to Owen and Pryor , Bush has nominated Ohio Supreme Court Justice Deborah Cook , who rose to prominence on the back of a statewide business campaign , which helped her raise $650,000 for her 2000 re-election . Other nominees have distinguished themselves as lawyers defending the rights and profits of corporations . Carolyn B. Kuhl , who Bush nominated for the 9th Circuit , represented tobacco and gas companies before becoming a California state judge , arguing against employee-discrimination claims and the right of whistleblowers to sue corporations . John Roberts , a Bush nominee who recently won confirmation to the District of Columbia Circuit Court , worked as an attorney to strike down new clean-air rules and filed a brief for the National Mining Association , arguing that federal courts could not stop mountaintop-removal mining in West Virginia . Business groups cheered the appointment of Jeffrey Sutton , a conservative activist , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers over the states , including a successful case that voided federal employee-discrimination laws . Another nominee , Victor Wolski , who was confirmed to the Court of Federal Claims , worked for years as an attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation , an organization devoted to rolling back the " regulatory state . " " Every single job I 've taken since college has been ideologically oriented , trying to further my principles , " Wolski told a reporter in 1999 . <p> DAYS BEFORE PRYOR 'S VOTE on the Senate floor in July , a benign-sounding group called the Committee for Justice began running print and radio advertisements accusing Democrats of blocking Pryor because he was Catholic . One pictured a courthouse door hung with a sign that read " Catholics Need Not Apply . " Democrats sensed a pattern forming . A few months earlier , the committee had run television spots accusing liberal senators of being anti-Hispanic for blocking Miguel Estrada , another business-friendly nominee who later withdrew following a Democratic filibuster . " America is a monument to the willing , where we can dream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " intoned the voice-over , as the ad showed a young Hispanic boy seeking a job at a bakery . " But there 's still intolerance . " <p> Voters could have been forgiven if they had mistaken the Committee for Justice as a civil-rights group founded to stamp out ethnic and religious bias . In fact , the group was formed by a chief lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the president of the American Council of Life Insurers , and a half-dozen lobbyists for the energy , tobacco , technology , and pharmaceutical industries . " There has been increasing attention on the impact of judicial decisions on the ability to run a business , " explains Jim Whittinghill , chief lobbyist for the American Trucking Associations , which sponsored a recent committee fundraiser . " We are in courts all the time . " Federal Express cosponsored the same event , owing to a " whole host of regulatory issues , " ranging from airline regulations to the rights of private mail services . The committee has declined to disclose its list of donors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest in a string of nonprofit groups funded by corporations and foundations that seek to influence legal thought . These groups range from the conservative law and economics programs at major universities , to nonprofits like the Washington Legal Foundation , to high-powered networking organizations like the Federalist Society . In recent years , major companies , including Shell and Exxon , have also sponsored lavish educational seminars for sitting federal judges , with opportunities for golf and horseback riding on the side . " The idea has been to educate judges on economic issues , " says James Piereson , executive director of the conservative Olin Foundation , which has funded several of the seminars . " I 've gone to a couple of those things , and the judges have taken me aside and told me that it has been very helpful . " <p> Corporations have also funded local efforts to press legislators to approve the president 's judicial picks . On a recent swing through his home state of Michigan , Democratic Senator Carl Levin was greeted by protesters with signs that declared " We Want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd was not concerned with voter disenfranchisement or overflowing jails  --  it wanted to remake the federal appellate bench . " We need judges who respect the private sector and property rights , " announced protest organizer Steve Williams , the local leader of Citizens for a Sound Economy . <p> Like the Committee for Justice , Citizens for a Sound Economy ( CSE ) is led by C. Boyden Gray , White House counsel under Bush 's father , and was created to anonymously leverage corporate contributions into debates on public policy . In recent months , the group has repeatedly picketed Democratic senators and organized a letter-writing campaign demanding swift approval of the Bush nominees . Historically , companies as varied as General Motors , Unilever , and Anheuser-Busch have filled CSE 's coffers . But the group wo n't say who is funding the protests against Levin , who is blocking several of Bush 's nominees from Michigan . <p> Joe Carney , a union electrician who chairs the Livingston County Democratic Party , says he did n't understand what motivated the protesters who crashed the local event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges have to do with ' Citizens for a Sound Economy , ' " said Carney , who has been out of work during the economic downturn and is furious about the latest round of tax cuts . " If you want to talk about the economy , then you should talk about it . " <p> Meanwhile , Judge Owen 's political mentor in Texas , Ralph Wayne , has been busy organizing a lobbying campaign against Democratic senators in 10 states who are blocking her nomination ; he has enlisted leaders from the National Federation of Independent Businesses as well as organizations representing doctors he says , " had any social issues . " <p> But as with so much in the behind-the-scenes battle for control of the federal judiciary , Wayne 's work has escaped public attention . The corporate candidates he represents will reshape America 's legal landscape for at least a generation , but their connections remain largely unnoticed . When Owen came before the Judiciary Committee for her own nomination hearing , she faced only a handful of questions about her corporate sponsors or pro-business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day read " Debate on Court Nominee Centers on Abortion .
