A smart dresser needs smart shoes , right ? But one does need to tread carefully ... <p> MY SHOES WERE WORN OUT and I was passing a Goodwill store so I went in to see if they had anything that would fit me . The assortment you find in places like this is not to the most exacting taste . And the sizes they get do n't fit a normal foot like mine . But this time I lucked out . A pair of lovely heavy cordovans . Built to last . Looking brand new , except for the deep gouge on top of one toe , a mark that had undoubtedly resulted in the shoes " disposal . The outer leather had been scraped away - maybe by some indigent like myself , outraged at so expensive a pair of shoes . You never know , it 's the sort of thing I might have done myself in one of my darker moods . But today I was feeling good . You do n't find a pair of shoes like this every day , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ragged K-Mart sneakers and slipped into the cordovans , to see if they fit . Immediately I heard a voice in my mind , clear as a bell , saying , " You 're not Carlton Johnson . Who are you ? " " I 'm Ed Phillips , " I said aloud . " Well , you have no right to be wearing Carlton Johnson 's shoes . " " Hey , look , " I said , " I 'm in a Goodwill , these shoes are priced at four bucks , they 're here for anyone to buy . " " Are you sure ? " the voice said . " Carlton Johnson would n't have just given me away . He was so pleased when he purchased me , so happy when I was enabled to give him the maximum in shoe comfort . " " Who are you ? " I said . " Is n't it obvious ? I am a prototype smart shoe , talking to you through micro-connections in my sole . I pick up your subvocalizations via your throat muscles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You can do all that ? " " Yes , and more . Like I said , I 'm a smart shoe . " By this time I noticed that a couple of ladies were looking at me funny and I realized they could hear only one side of the conversation , since the other side seemed to be taking place in my head . I paid for the shoes , which offered no further comment , and I got out of there . Back to my own place , an efficiency one-room apartment in the Jack London Hotel on 4th near Pike . No comment from the shoes until I reached the top linoleum-covered step of the two-flight walk to my apartment , the elevator being a non-starter this evening . The shoes said , " What a dump . " " How can you see my place ? " " My eyelets , where the laces go , are light-absorbing diodes . " " I realize you were used to better things with Carlton Johnson , " I said . " Everything was carpeted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished floor left bare on purpose . " It paused and sighed . " The wear on me was minimal . " " And here you are in a flophouse , " I said " How have the mighty fallen ! " I must have raised my voice , because a door in the corridor opened and an old woman peered out . When she saw me apparently talking to myself , she shook her head sadly and closed the door . " You do not have to shout , " the shoes said . " Just directing your thoughts toward me is sufficient . I have no trouble picking up your subvocalizations . " " I guess I 'm embarrassing you , " I said aloud . " I am so terribly sorry . " " Am I ever going to hear the last of that guy ? " " Do n't worry , my deconditioning circuitry has kicked in . But it takes time for the aura effect to wear off . " I WATCHED A LITTLE television and went to bed . Buying a pair of smart shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time in the small hours of the night . The shoes were up to something , I could tell even without wearing them . " What are you up to ? " I asked , then realized the shoes could n't hear me and groped around on the floor for them . " Do n't bother , " the shoes said . " I can pick up your subvocalizations on remote , without a hard hookup . " " So what are you doing ? " " Just extracting square roots in my head . I ca n't sleep . " " Since when does a computer have to sleep ? " " A fault in my standby mode .... I need something to do . I miss my peripherals . " " What are you talking about ? " " Carlton Phillips had eyeglasses . I was able to tweak them up to give him better vision . You would n't happen to have a pair , would you ? " " I 've got a pair , but I do n't use them much . " " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " I got out of bed , found my reading glasses on top of the TV , and set them down beside the shoes . " Thank you , " the shoe computer said . " Mrggh , " I said , and went back to sleep . " So tell me something about yourself , 11 the shoes said in the morning . " What 's to tell ? I 'm a free-lance writer . Things have been going so well that I can afford to live in the lack London . End of story . " " Can I see some of your work ? " " Are you a critic , too ? " " Not at all ! But I am a creative thinking machine , and I may have some ideas that could be of use to you . " " Forget about it , " I told him . " I do n't want to show you any of my stuff . " The shoes said , " I happened to glance over your story Killer Goddess of the Dark Moon Belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it ? " I asked . " I do n't remember showing it to you . " " It was lying open on your table . " " So all you could see was the title page . " " As a matter of fact , I read the whole thing . " " How were you able to do that ? " " I made a few adjustments to your glasses , " the shoe said . " X-ray vision is n't so difficult to set up . I was able to read each page through the one above it . " " That 's quite an accomplishment , " I said . " But I do n't appreciate you poking into my private matters . " " Private ? You were going to send it to a magazine . " " But I have n't yet .... What did you think of it ? , " " Old-fashioned . That sort of thing does n't sell anymore . " " It was a parody , dummy .... So now you 're not only a shoe adjuster but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did glance over the writing books in your bookcase . " By the sound of the thoughts in my head , I could tell he did n't approve of my books , either . " You know , " the shoe said later , " You really do n't have to be a bum , Ed . You 're bright . You could make something of yourself . " " What are you , a psychologist as well as a shoe computer ? " " Nothing of the sort . I have no illusions about myself . But I 've gotten to know you a bit in the last few hours since my empathy circuitry kicked in . I ca n't help but notice - to know - that you 're an intelligent man with a good general education . All you need is a little ambition . You know , Ed , that could be supplied by a good woman . " " The last good woman left me shuddering , " I said . " I 'm really not ready just yet for the next one . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thinking about Marsha - " " How in hell do you know about Marsha ? " " Her name is in your little red phone book , which I happened to glance through with my X-ray vision in my efforts to better serve you . " " Listen , even my writing down Marsha 's name was a mistake . She 's a professional do-gooder . I hate that type . " " But she could be good for you . I noticed you put a star after her name . " " Did you also notice I crossed out the star ? " " That was a second thought . Now , on third thought , she might start looking good again . I suspect you two could go well together . " " You may be good at shoes , " I said , " but you know nothing about the sort of women I like . Have you seen her legs ? " " The photo in your wallet showed only her face . " " What ? You looked in my wallet , too ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of any prurient interest , Ed , I assure you . I just want to help . " " You 're already helping too much . " " I hope you wo n't mind the one little step I took . " " Step ? What step ? " My doorbell rang . I glared at my shoes . " I took the liberty of calling Marsha and asking her over . " " YOU DID WHAT ? " " Ed , Ed , calm down ! I know it was taking a liberty . It 's not as if I called your former boss , Mr. Edgarson , at Super-Gloss Publications . " " You would n't dare ! " " I would , but I did n't . But you could do a lot worse than go back to work for Edgarson . The salary was very nice . " " Have you read any of Gloss 's publications ? I do n't know what you think you 're doing , but you are n't going to do it to me ! " " Ed , Ed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist , I wo n't . Not without your permission ! " There was a knock at the door . " Ed , I 'm only trying to look out for you . What 's a machine with empathy circuits and excess computing ability to do ? " " I 'll tell you in a moment , " I said . I opened the door . Marsha stood there , beaming . " Oh , Ed , I 'm so glad you called ! " So the son of a bitch had imitated my voice , too ! I glanced down at my shoes , at the gash in the cap of the left one . A light went off in my head . Realization ! Epiphany ! " Come in , Marcia , " I said . " I 'm glad to see you . I have something for you . " She entered . I sat down in the only decent chair and stripped off the shoes , ignoring the shoe computer 's agonized cry in my head of " Ed ! Do n't do this to me ..... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's this ? " she said . " Shoes for one of your charity cases , " I said . " Sorry I do n't have a paper bag for you to carry them in . " " But what am I going to do with - " " Marsha , these are special shoes , computerized shoes . Give them to one of your down-and-outers , get him to put them on . They 'll make a new man of him . Pick one of the weak-willed ones you specialize in . It 'll give him backbone ! " She looked at the shoes . " This gash in one of them " A minor flaw . I 'm pretty sure the former owner did that himself , " I told her . " A guy named Carlton Johnson . He could n't stand the computer 's messing around with his head , so he disfigured them and gave them away . Marsha , believe me , these shoes are perfect for the right man . Carlton Johnson was n't the right man , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground you walk on for these , believe me . " And with that , I began herding her toward the door . " When will I hear from you ? " she said . " Do n't worry , I 'll call , " I told her , reveling in the swinish lie that went along with my despicable life .
