In the throes of the AIDS pandemic , Zimbabweans are adapting to death as a way of life . <p> WHEN THE PHOTOGRAPHER KRISTEN ASHBURN went to a township outside Harare in 2002 , she came upon a woman carrying her grown son in her arms  --  intent on giving him a bath . For the past two years , 20-year-old Simba had been unable to walk or speak because an AIDS-related fungus had infected his brain . Taking care of him was a 24-hour job ; even if she had been able to find employment in a nation where 75 percent are unemployed , and 34 percent are HIV positive , this woman could not have considered it . <p> But statistics alone do not tell this story . What Ashburn 's images convey is the tortured psychological reality behind them . A boy preparing coffins . Two children waiting for their sick mother to arrive . An aunt in grief for her nephew . A mother cradling her emaciated son . None of this is normal . <p> What Ashburn 's haunting photographs may obscure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages  --  no son , brother , sister , friend , lover  --  needed to die . I know of no photographer , journalist , or filmmaker who has traveled to sub-Saharan Africa and not been devastated by what they witnessed : people dying in genocidal proportions of a treatable disease . <p> Last January , President Bush promised $15 billion , over five years , to sub-Saharan African nations and the Caribbean for AIDS prevention and treatment . Bush 's pledge appeared beneficent , but a third of the money he promised for 2004 did not materialize . Meanwhile , the U.S. government , in line with the pharmaceutical lobby , continues to push brutal , unfair drug patents on Third World nations , keeping life-sustaining medicines from 95 percent of the world . It has even worked to sideline the U.N.-backed Global AIDS Fund , which has endorsed cheap , high-quality generics . The fund is thus nearly bankrupt . <p> It may come as a surprise to Americans that , in spite of the high-minded rhetoric , far less than 1 percent of African HIV patients are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continent in which 34 million are infected . Time will tell if the controversial WTO accord to export generics can improve access to treatment , but time , as these photographs make painfully clear , is a commodity that people with AIDS in Africa do not have . <p> The Bush administration has also denied AIDS funding to African regimes it finds objectionable , including Zimbabwe 's . In an open letter to President Bush , T. Kujinga , founder of the Mutate-based AIDS organization , the Life Project , writes , " We are painfully aware that Zimbabwe is not listed as a recipient of the president 's philanthropy . " Zimbabweans are suffering under the double burden of a staggering HIV rate and President Robert Mugabe 's harsh policies , he adds , and " ought not to be excluded from any treatment initiatives ... because of government to government hostilities . " <p> I wrote to Kujinga and received an extraordinary 12-page letter in reply . His story illustrates the maddening inaccessibility of treatment in Zimbabwe , even to the luckiest few who can afford it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elite . When a friend , whose wife had died from AIDS , became ill in 2001 , Kujinga took him in with his two daughters . The friend soon died , and then , in August 2002 , Kujinga discovered that one of the children was positive . " That was the beginning of my nightmare , and was to change my life and career . " <p> What Kujinga then went through in search of anti-retroviral treatment for his daughter  --  " for that is what I consider her to be "  --  can only be described as surreal . He bought a month 's supply of a three-drug cocktail from a doctor , for which he paid $30 , a " princely sum " ( more than a third of his monthly salary ) , " but still affordable to a lawyer . " Over the next two months , prices doubled , but he was still able to purchase the cocktail from a local pharmacy . The next month the drugs became scarce , forcing Kujinga to turn to the South African black market to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen not only massive human-rights violations , but economic devastation . Half the nation now needs food assistance . Inflation is approaching 700 percent . Just finding gasoline and getting to work is a terrible burden for most . Those few who can initially afford anti-retroviral treatment often can not sustain it because of erratic supplies and hyper-inflated costs . " Such an economic system , " he writes , " became a nightmare for me . " <p> Kujinga soon gave up his legal practice to found the Life Project , which helps others find treatment . But he adds that most Zimbabwean AIDS activists are either " indifferent " to or do not know what anti-retrovirals are . " The situation is desperate and pathetic , " he writes . " People are dying without help and without hope . We now have more orphans than ever before . And our hospitals are flooded with pathetic skeletons of dead people walking .
