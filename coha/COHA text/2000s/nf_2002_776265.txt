They 're in the River // I had n't been a shad fisherman all my days , only seven years , on the May evening when this story begins - in a johnboat , flat and square , anchored in heavy current by the bridge in Lambertville , on the wall of the eddy below the fourth pier . I say Lambertville ( New Jersey ) because that 's where we launch , but the Delaware River is more than a thousand feet wide there , and , counting west- ward , the fourth of the five stone bridge piers is close to New Hope , Pennsylvania . Yet it rises from the channel where the river is deepest . // American shad are schooling ocean fish , and when they come in to make their run up the river they follow the deep channels . In the estuary toward the end of winter , they mill around in tremendous numbers , waiting for the temperature in the cold river current to rise . When it warms past forty Fahrenheit , they begin their migration , in pulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . Soon , a single sentence moves northward with them - in e-mails , on telephones , down hallways , up streets - sending amps and volts through the likes of me . The phone rings , and someone says , " They 're in the river . " // No two shad fishermen agree on much of anything , but I would say that if a female takes your lure you know it from the first moments , or think you do , and you 're not often wrong . If you have a male on , you may be at first uncertain . but then he displays his character and you know it 's a buck shad . The roe shad is often twice the size of the buck shad . She may weigh five to six pounds , while he weighs two or three . Shad do n't exactly strike . First there 's a fixed moment - a second or two in which you feel what appears to be a snag ( and might be ) ; then the bottom of the river seems to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and you start thinking five , six pounds , big fillets in the broiler , the grained savor of lemoned roe ; but now this little buck shad - two and a half pounds - takes off across the river , flies into the air , and struts around on his tail . He leaps again . He leaps once more and does a complete somersault . He ca n't be said to be cocky , of course , but he suggests cockiness and pretension . He 's all show and no roe . She does n't move . Her size and weight are not at first especially employed . Yet here is the message she sends up the line : If this is n't bedrock you 'd be better off if it were ; if you 're in a hurry , get out your scissors . She stays low , and holds ; and soon you are sure about the weight and the sex . Now , straight across the river and away , deep , she strips line , your reel drag clicking . She turns and moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep things taut but often she 'll do it for you . When , rising , she rolls near the surface , she looks even larger than she is . She , too , can leap , can do a front flip , but she obviously knows that her shrewdest position is broadside to full current . It 's as difficult to move her as it would be to reel in a boat sideways . // Like salmon , shad return to their natal rivers and eat nothing on the spawning run . Lake salmon swimming two thousand miles up the Yukon River , migrating shad exist on their own fat . So why do shad and salmon respond to lures ? Up and down the river , almost everybody has an answer to that fundamental question , but no one - bartender or biologist - really knows . A plurality will tell you that the fish are expressing irritation . Flutter something colorful in their faces and shad will either ignore it completely or snap at it like pit bulls . More precisely , they 'll swing their heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't swallow , since they 're not eating . Essentially never does a hook reach the gills , or even much inside the mouth . You hook them in the mouth 's outer rim - in the premaxillary and maxillary bones and sometimes in the ethmoid region at the tip of the snout , all of which are segments of the large open scoop that plows through plankton at sea . // Below the Lambertville-New Hope bridge that evening , I was using a shad dart of my own malting . A small metallic cone , it trailed bucktail tied on in a vise . Its body was chartreuse . Its base was dark green . It was coated with clear gloss . Extending with the bucktail from the tip of the cone , its No. 2 hook was black and chemically sharpened . Because the hook shaft includes a right angle and the eye emerges from the side of the cone , a shad dart is hydrodynamically hapless . It flips and flops and buzzes around like a fly that needs killing . If it snags , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Held in the water column by the driving current , my dart was out about seventy feet . // Three of us were in the boat , close and tandem . I was in the middle , fishing over the shoulder of the skipper , Ed Cervone . Fishing over my shoulder was Ed 's son , Edmund Cervone . Each of them had caught several shad , varying in sex , notable in size . I had caught two roe shad . The sun was setting . It was seven-thirty . Quitting time was upon us , but the rod in my hand was suddenly pulled by a great deal more than the current . The Cervones reeled in their darts and stowed their rods . They would wait and watch , as people do when someone else in a boat has a fish on the line . // It felt heavy . It maintained for some time a severe tug without much lateral movement . " Female , " I said . " Six pounds . " Cervone the Elder , who has a doctorate in psychology , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrug , that he knew bullshit by its cover . He knew he was n't fishing with Buddy Grucela . He knew he was n't fishing with Erwin Dietz or Gerald Hartzel - living figures in the Cooperstown of shad . He knew that in my seven years as a shad fisherman I had risen steadily into a zone of terminal mediocrity . And he was well equipped to empathize . Ours was one of twelve boats below and around the western bridge piers . Nearly all the others had been doing well , too . When that fish of mine came on the line toward the end of the day , a guy in the boat next to us looked over and said , " It does n't get any better than this , does it ? " At that moment , thirty feet of line came off the reel against the drag . I thought the line would snap . // Dietz and Hartzel are waders , bank fishermen , and you 'd usually encounter them far upriver - at least three hundred miles above the sea buoy - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rapids , and has cut a deep gorge in the Pocono-Catskill plateau . The night air , cooler than the water , makes a thick early mist there . If you wanted to fish near a monumental figure like Dietz , and possibly be there ahead of him , you had to be on the river before dawn . As the light came up , it revealed a dark silhouette in the drifting vapors , standing on a rock catching fish . He always knew how many . " How many is that ? " " Eleven . " I could fish near him until the sun was high , doing everything he did , and catch nothing , or one or two . Nearing retirement , he was a mason then , in New York City construction . He lived in Queens . // Somewhere in my fishing diaries I wrote : " He recovers his dart and casts anew faster than anyone I 've ever seen . He brings fish in rapidly , and swiftly releases them . Then his dart is in the air . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his twitch minimal . While I am fishless , Dietz 's rod is electric with excitement . Two . Three . Four . He works fish . I watch . And watch . He loses a dart to a snag . Cool . He is idle . Out of it . I am casting - two , three , four . The numbers refer to casts but not to shad . At last he finishes tying on a new dart , and he flings it into the river . It swings through the current , and his rod is bent by another fish . How . . . Does . . . He . . . Do . . . It ? After he casts , he holds his rod at a forty-five-degree angle . His wrist flicks almost imperceptibly at a consistent rate of about once a second . He says he can feel the shad bump the dart in the center of the current , bump it again , and then go for it . His 4ne and his lures are identical with mine . I imitate him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hook water . " // As Gerald Hartzel stepped into the upper river at five-thirty of a June morning - after driving more than three hours - his shad net would be bolstered on his back so that its hoop rose above his head like a circular antenna . He reached for it often . He used a five-and-a-half-foot rod with four-pound line and an ultra-light reel . He had a long wooden staff that floated on a tether beside him . He was slim . Six feet . Polaroid glasses . On his brown hat were two fishing licenses . Sewn on both his hat and his vest was the orange-and-green emblem of the Delaware River Shad Fishermen 's Association . He cast with a short direct punch from eye level , as if he were throwing a dart not so much at a fish as at a tavern wall . As one such morning began , he caught a shad , and then another , but not rapidly , and he seemed puzzled . Then , arms up , he began to hold the rod high before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in quick succession , he flipped up the tip , up again , up once more - fish on the line . Rooted in fast water , apparently tireless , he caught shad after shad after shad , always with his arms extended high . His darts were very small . Across the morning , they were in the water an amazing percentage of the total time . He was efficient in the rhythm of his casts . Page 1 , line 1 : If your dart is not in the water you are not catching fish . Jigging - twitching - the line , he gave complete attention to each moment of every swing , his eyes swinging , too , like a long-bah hitter 's . After fishing downstream from him , I quit when he did . In four and a half hours , I had caught six shad , including one roe that I kept . In the four and a half hours , he had landed twenty-one shad . Wearily rubbing a shoulder , he said , " Did you see what I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
