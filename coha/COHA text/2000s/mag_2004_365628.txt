Bishop T.D . Jakes financed and stars in Woman , Thou Art Loosed , a film inspired by his best-selling self-help novel of the same name . <P> Is cinema the next frontier of evangelism ? It can be . The Gospel is not about standing and saying " Come to me . " It 's about going where they are , and the world is at the theater . <P> What does Woman , Thou Art Loosed mean ? It 's a direct quote from Luke 13 . It 's really about being free from the past , about forgiveness . <P> What is the message of the film ? That freedom is a personal choice that often turns on the axle of forgiveness . <P> Is the R rating a problem ? I would have rated it PG . The film does deal with serious issues . It 's similar to Mel Gibson 's dilemma with The Passion of the Christ . There 's no way to glamorize an execution on a Cross . If you 're going to broach a subject like child abuse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that into Kool-Aid and Oreo cookies . <P> Will you market this in the grass-roots way that Gibson did The Passion ? In the African-American community , we 've always marketed like that  --  through churches and beauty shops . <P> Would you act again ? Definitely . I 'd like positive roles  --  a caretaker , a counselor , a physician . I do n't think I would make a good monster .
