fitness diet Headnote No gimmicks , no lies-just 11 science-based shortcuts from slim-down guru JIM KARAS Photograph Wow ! Warp-speed weight loss with Karas 's smart strategies . // The trouble with dieting , " I hear many women say , " is that it takes too long . If I want to look good for my anniversary next month , I should 've started losing weight way back in February . Now that I 'm finally focused , it 's too late . " Well , yes and no . Taking the long-term approach to weight loss is wise because it means you 'll lose pounds slowly and steadily-making it more likely that you 'll keep them off . But there are ways to rev up your metabolism so you burn calories and lose weight more quickly . Check out my favorite no-fail jump starts . 1 DRINK GREEN TEA // Get this : When a recent study compared the metabolic effect of green tea ( in extract ) with that of a placebo , researchers found that the green-tea drinkers burned about 70 additional calories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those 70 calories a day add up to a total of 7.3 pounds of fat a year ! It 's not magic , it 's science : Researchers believe the difference is caused by metabolism-enhancing antioxidants known as catechins , which are found in green tea . 2 AVOID CALORIES IN A GLASS Scientists now know that the body does not register liquid calories in the same way it does solid calories . Drinking a grande caffe mocha , for instance , wo n't make you feel satiated the way eating a bowl of pasta will . Which means that although the caffe mocha actually has a greater number of calories than the pasta , you 're still more likely to want a second cup from Starbucks than another plate of linguine . So monitor your intake of juice , soda , coffee drinks , and wine . If you consume one of each of those beverages during the day , you 'll have taken in at least 800 extra calories by nighttime-and you 'll still be hungry . ( Incidentally , alcohol may suppress the metabolism of fat , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUY A SET OF FIVE-POUND WEIGHTS // It 's a onetime investment you 'll never regret . Here 's why : Strength training builds lean muscle tissue , which burns more calories-at work or at rest-24 hours a day , seven days a week . The more lean muscle you have , the faster you 'll slim down . How do you start strength training ? Try some push-ups , or a few squats or lunges . Use your free weights to perform simple biceps curls or triceps pulls right in your home or office . Do these exercises three to four times per week , and you 'll soon see a rapid improvement in your physique . 4 LOSE THE SALT Sodium contributes to water retention , making you look and feel bloated . Do you eat too much salt ? Probably-the daily value suggests no more than 2,400 milligrams of sodium each day ( or about one teaspoon ) , but most of us are getting more than twice that amount . So keep an eye on your sodium intake , and that does n't just mean ditching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks ( did you know a serving of regular V8 juice has 610 mg of sodium ? ) , salty snacks such as chips and pretzels , and many prepackaged foods . 5 SPICE IT UP Angelo Tremblay , Ph.D. , director of the division of kinesiology at Laval University , in Canada , found that eating hot peppers can boost a person 's basal metabolism ( the total calories the body burns at rest ) . The reason ? Capsaicin , a compound found in jalapeno and cayenne peppers , may increase your body 's release of stress hormones such as adrenaline , which can speed up your metabolism and your ability to burn calories . What 's more , eating hot peppers may reduce your appetite , Tremblay says , helping to curb your cravings . So spice up your stir-fried veggies , eat low-calorie chili or salsa ( try them on salads and baked potatoes ) , and watch the pounds come off faster . 6 GET SOME SLEEP // As funny as it sounds , sleep deprivation may make you fat-and not just because you 're susceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that too ) . Women who get less than four hours of sleep per night have a slower metabolism than those who snooze for a full eight hours , according to researchers at the University of Chicago . So do n't skimp on your zzz 's , and you 'll be rewarded with an extra edge when it comes to shedding pounds quickly . 7 GO FOR AN EVENING WALK Do n't get me wrong-exercising at any time is good for you . But evening activity may be particularly beneficial because many people 's metabolism slows down toward the end of the day . Thirty minutes of aerobic activity before dinner increases your metabolic rate and may keep it elevated for another two or three hours , even after you 've stopped moving . What that means for you : Those dinner calories have less of a chance to take up permanent residence on your hips . 8 EAT EVERY MEAL Listen up : Skipping meals will not make you lose weight faster . That strategy backfires because your body thinks food is in short supply , so it slows your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result is that when you do eat-even if you consume the same foods as always-your body will be slower to use the calories as fuel , thus creating a backlog of unwanted pounds . If a hectic day makes a sit-down meal impossible , stash an energy bar or a piece of fruit in your purse or briefcase , anything that will keep you from going hungry . 9 ADD 20 MINUTES OF EXERCISE PER DAY // If you 're on a diet , you 're probably already working out a couple of times a week . ( No ? Well , you should start ! ) But whether you exercise or not , you can get a leg up on all those other weight-loss wanna-bes by doing a little something extra each day . Take the stairs instead of the elevator ; walk to the bus , train , or all the way to the office ; window-shop with your best friend rather than sit over coffee . Taking the dog out , gardening , and even housecleaning all increase the number of calories you expend . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help ! ) to speed up weight loss . Twenty minutes of moderate exercise a day means you 'll burn approximately 700 calories weekly-and lose one extra pound per month-without even trying . 10 Hsub 2O , Hsub 2O , Hsub 2O , Hsub 2O You 've heard it before , and you 'll hear it again . That 's because drinking 64 ounces of water daily is one of the easiest ways to speed up weight loss . Your body needs water in order to efficiently metabolize stored fat . When you shortchange your supply , you 're likely to slow down that process , meaning it 's more difficult for you to burn calories . An easy eight glasses a day ( at least ! ) will keep your system running smoothly . 11 DO N'T GO FOR THE GIMMICKS At any given time , there are dozens of weight-loss hypes in the marketplace that claim to have the ability to take off ten pounds in ten days , or whatever . Desperation can tempt us to try anything , but you and I both know these schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importantly , save yourself from the emotional pain when these gimmicks fail . Be realistic . Jump-start your weight-loss program in ways that make sense , and not only will you be thinner , you 'll be happier too .
