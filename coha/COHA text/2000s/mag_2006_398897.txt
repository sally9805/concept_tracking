( AFTER DEATH ) <p> Seven years ago , my dad gave a stranger the most valuable gift of all : life . <p> You could do the same one day . <p> All it takes is 2 minutes and a pen . <p> Why are n't you an organ donor yet ? <p> My father died on October 26 , 1999 , after falling down eight steps . That 's where some stories end . It 's where this one begins . <p> Dad was an organ donor . <p> And when you 're an organ donor in today 's world , where miracle machines can sustain the mechanical functions of the body , you do n't die in a conventional sense . <p> You do n't stop breathing . <p> Your heart does n't stop beating . <p> You do n't turn cold . <p> Rigor mortis does n't set in . <p> You 're dead , but every organ continues to function normally . <p> Well , except one . <p> Your brain . <p> It 's called brain death , and it 's especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . <p> Consider : As my family gathered at my father 's bedside to say our last goodbyes , machines beeped and whirred behind him . One showed that his blood pressure was 146/100 and his pulse 98 . Another reported that he was breathing 20 times per minute . His face was flushed . His skin was warm . Five minutes before , he was alive , technically . Then two doctors came by and declared him dead , technically . But nothing seemed to have changed , really . Time of " death " was 1:26 p.m . <p> Dad was only 59 . Two days before , he 'd met my future in-laws for the first time . They talked of grandchildren to come and vacationing together someday . I could n't believe this was the end . As I left Dad 's hospital room , I stopped and looked back . I saw him lying there as he 'd been for the previous 44 hours . I saw the organ-recovery coordinator entering the room . I suddenly became uneasy , overcome with guilt . It felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after , I wondered : What happened to him next ? <p> Now I know . <p> And as I pieced together the past , I learned a few things : That organ transplantation is brutal , gruesome , lifesaving , and far too rare . That there 's a huge shortage of organs in this country . That the extraordinary efforts of scientists will soon bridge that gap , saving many more lives  --  perhaps yours , perhaps mine . <p> But mostly , I learned how my father changed one man 's life that day . <p> EVEN IF YOU 'RE AMONG the 46 percent of Americans who 've checked the organ-donor box on your driver's-license application , you 're not likely to ever become one . If your heart stops  --  the most common cause of death  --  odds are your organs will go to the grave with you . After heart failure , they begin shutting down within minutes , poisoned by the hormones a dying body releases specifically for that purpose . <p> This keeps the pool of organs from deceased donors pretty small . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hooked up to lifesaving equipment in a hospital at the moment their neurons cease firing . Patients like my father . Because the heart has its own built-in pacemaker , it can continue beating as long as it has access to oxygen . So doctors can trick the body into thinking it 's still alive long enough to recover healthy , functioning organs for transplant . <p> But of the 2.2 million people who die in U.S. hospitals each year , only 20,000  --  less than 1 percent  --  are brain deaths . Almost half do n't consent to organ donation . A quarter of the rest ca n't donate because at the time of death , they 're either too old or too sick . ( All cancer patients are disqualified . ) That leaves 7,500 deceased donors annually who pass on an average of two organs each . <p> Right now , more than 94,000 Americans are waiting for an organ transplant . Today , 77 of them will get one . But also today , 18 will die waiting , and 122 new patients will be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country who died of brain death donated his or her organs , there still would n't be enough to go around , " says Fadi Lakkis , M.D. , scientific director of the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute , in Pittsburgh . " We need to find other sources , sure , but we must also reduce the number of recipients who need second and third transplants . That means eliminating organ rejection . " OCTOBER 26 , 1:44 PM <p> My father was attended by a critical-care physician , a transplant surgeon , and the organ-procurement coordinator , who was also a registered nurse . Their top priority was to keep my father 's organs functioning until they could be " recovered . " <p> After brain death , my father 's body would have quickly shut down . But the organ coordinator would n't let it . She gave him a dose of steroids to improve lung function , and slowed his ventilator so he 'd take fuller , deeper breaths . The longer the air stayed in his lungs , the more oxygen would make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Meanwhile , a computer search was turning up potential recipients for my father 's organs . The coordinator entered various parameters-height , weight , and blood type  --  into the national database , and out popped a list of the sickest patients , organized by proximity to the donor . <p> The doctors treating the nearest " status 1 " patients  --  people in danger of dying within a week  --  got first dibs . Because the University of Pittsburgh medical center , where my dad was taken after his fall , operates one of the largest transplant centers on the East Coast , most of the potential recipients were patients there . Farther down the list , however , were candidates from Puerto Rico and California . They 'd be backups if the organs were healthy enough to transplant but could n't be used locally . <p> Now the phone calls began , starting at the top of the list for each organ . There was immediate interest in my father 's kidneys , liver , heart , and pancreas . His lungs were also under consideration , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the slightest nick during recovery can ruin them . <p> My dad 's were still working well , so the coordinator was hopeful . <p> THE HOSPITAL ACTUALLY did n't need our permission to take Dad 's organs . His driver 's license said " organ donor " right on the front , and that 's legally binding in Pennsylvania , as it is in most states . But taking a dead man 's organs without consulting the family is bad form , so the decision is always left to the next of kin . <p> We met with the organ-procurement coordinator 5 hours before Dad was declared brain dead . She explained that , along with the major organs , doctors can recover tendons , cartilage , corneas , bones , and even skin . These tissues have a variety of uses , from knee surgeries to burn grafts . They 're blasted with radiation before they 're transplanted , so they 're dead on a cellular level and therefore wo n't be rejected by the recipient 's immune system . Mum gave consent for corneas , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliced up , " she told us . <p> The organ coordinator had actually been called in the night before . At that point , we 'd known Dad was n't going to make it . But still , when your father is dying and you 've agreed to give away his organs , you ca n't help but sense vultures circling . <p> " We get that a lot , " says Bryan Nelson , a 3-year veteran of Gift of Life , the procurement organization serving eastern Pennsylvania , southern New Jersey , and Delaware . " We stay out of sight until the family expresses an interest in donation . But we do try to get a head start sometimes , because recipients will fare better if we can shorten the hours between brain death and organ recovery . " <p> The day my father died , a 53-year-old man named Shin Lee was in the same hospital , two floors away and close to death . <p> In many ways , Lee is the poster child for organ rejection . In 1984 , at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a chronic condition , affecting up to 10 percent of Asian-Americans , and it can progress to cirrhosis , cancer , and liver failure . And so it went for Lee , a father of three , who received his first liver transplant in 1992 . He immediately started taking three drugs to suppress his immune system , so that his body would n't see his new liver as a foreign invader and try to destroy it . But his immune response prevailed , and by the fall of 1998 , Lee was back on the waiting list . <p> Lee waited 13 months for a new liver . Each day , he got sicker . Each day , he moved up the list . The day my father was put on life support , Lee made it to the top of the list . One man 's tragic day was another 's lucky day . <p> A few months before the transplant , Lee 's immune-suppressing drugs had begun taking a toll on his kidneys . They failed , and he started dialysis . Dialysis is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's also grueling  --  4 hours a day , 3 days a week  --  and temporary : It causes dangerous calcium deposits in the blood vessels , lungs , and heart . <p> So , after receiving his new liver , Lee went back on the waiting list , this time for a kidney . In the summer of 2003 , he got it . <p> That 's three new organs in 14 years . Lee 's case is not unique . Almost 15 percent of all patients on the waiting list are repeat customers . Organ recipients are rarely cured , says Dr. Lakkis . The cycle just continues . <p> Chronic rejection has a combination of causes : the continuous , low-grade immune response ( drugs ca n't turn it off completely ) and the toxicity of the drugs themselves . But there 's another side to the problem : Many organ recipients die of strokes and heart attacks , not organ failure , says Dr. Lakkis . Chronic rejection causes scarring not just within the transplanted organ , but also within all the organs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If rejection does n't kill the organ first , it eventually kills the person . <p> DEREK BESENFELDER does n't take antirejection drugs . He does n't have to . The 27-year-old kidney recipient is one of just 10 patients in the United States who submitted to an experimental surgery that eliminates the need for immunosuppressants after a transplant . His immune system does n't attack his new kidney because , well , it 's not exactly his immune system anymore . <p> The immune system , for all its benefits , is pretty stupid . It does n't know the difference between a mosquito bite and a transplanted heart , for example . When it detects a foreign cell within your body , it issues the same order : Kill . <p> Besenfelder , who received his transplant at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston last February , essentially had his immune system reprogrammed . He received new bone marrow along with his new kidney  --  from the same donor  --  and over the next 2 weeks , his bone marrow reconstituted with both his own and the donor 's immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his own . <p> " With a traditional transplant and anti-rejection drugs , you have a 90 percent chance of having a functioning kidney in a year , " says David Sachs , M.D. , director of the Transplantation Biology Research Center at Massachusetts General . " That goes down 4 percent a year , so in 10 years , there 's only a 65 percent chance your kidney 's still functioning . And you may need a new kidney within 20 years . Plus , there are all the quality-of-life issues . <p> " With our new approach , the organ wo n't be rejected and you wo n't take immunosuppressant drugs , " he continues . " That 's pretty compelling for a young person . " <p> It 's also pretty risky . When you obliterate a person 's immune system , the potential exists for a serious infection , particularly in the first few weeks . <p> " It 's not an easy choice , " admits Dr. Sachs . <p> For this reason , the Starzl Institute takes a less radical approach to reducing chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Campath . Dr. Lakkis compares the standard immunosuppressants to " a boot on the neck of the immune system . If you try to reduce the dose later , you lift the boot , and the T cells go wild . " The response is so extreme , in fact , that the immune system attacks not only the transplanted organ but neighboring tissues as well . " Our approach does n't hold down the T cells , " Dr. Lakkis says . " It kills them . " <p> Every transplant patient at the Starzl Institute takes Campath in the hours before the operation . Unlike an antirejection drug , it 's a onetime dose . When surgeons transplant the organ , the drug binds to the T and B cells as they leave the bone marrow , and destroys many of them . " So now , instead of having a mountain of cells attacking the organ , we have a hill , " says Dr. Lakkis . " And instead of giving three antirejection drugs after a transplant , we can sometimes use just one . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a few patients who 've been weaned from their immunosuppressants entirely , " Dr. Lakkis continues , " and are now leading normal lives . " OCTOBER 26 , 4:55 PM <p> Dad was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab . A local transplant surgeon was interested in his heart but wanted to confirm the results of an earlier echocardiogram  --  done bedside  --  that suggested his heart was strong and structurally sound . <p> Bad news : One of the vessels supplying his heart was 70 percent blocked . Another was thinning and bulging  --  an aneurysm in the making . Dad 's heart could not be transplanted . The same was true of his lungs : A chest x-ray revealed spots on them . The doctors suspected pus , which meant his lungs were probably infected . <p> Two hours later , better news : The results were in from the latest battery of blood tests  --  23 in all  --  and Dad 's liver function was excellent . The recipient would be a 53-year-old man , Shin Lee . He was a status-1A patient , meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new liver . His doctor delivered the good news . <p> IF CHIMPANZEES WERE PESTS , our organ shortage might be solved . Genetically , we differ from them by less than 2 percent . And they 're just about our size . But they 're also an endangered species . And besides , organ shortage or not , it 's hard to ethically justify killing a first cousin . <p> Pigs , on the other hand , are bred for bacon . " Why not for hearts and livers ? " asks Dr. Sachs , one of the world 's foremost authorities in the field of xenotransplantation  --  that is , transplanting organs from animals to people . <p> Over the past 3 years , Dr. Sachs has engineered a colony of identical pigs , each with a special quality : Its organs could be transplanted into humans , at least theoretically . But that 's years away . Dr. Sachs is first trying to prove that it works by transplanting these organs into one of our evolutionary relatives : the baboon . <p> If the differences between a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're even more acute at the cellular level . Every pig cell is coated with a sugar called alpha 1,3-galactose . In fact , almost every cell in every living creature has this sugar . The only exceptions : old-world primates , which include chimpanzees , great apes , baboons , and , yes , humans . At some point , as we evolved , we lost our sugar , so to speak . <p> But since the sugar is in bacteria and on viruses , our immune systems have antibodies to fight it . Put a pig organ in a human being , and the person 's immune system would destroy it within minutes . <p> Dr. Sachs 's goal , then , was to engineer pigs that do n't have alpha 1,3-galactose on their cells . And he has , about 500 in all . He uses what 's called nuclear-transfer technology  --  it 's the same process that created Dolly , the cloned sheep . You take the nucleus out of a fertilized egg , replace the sugar-producing gene with a placeholder gene , then put the nucleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born , does n't carry the sugar . <p> " We 've been doing a few experimental transplants a week , " Dr. Sachs tells me , as we walk past the test pigs and baboons in pristine pens . " And the results have been phenomenal . We had a baboon live for 80 days with a pig kidney . And it died of a heart attack , not organ failure . " <p> I ask Dr. Sachs if he really envisions a day when animals are bred for organs . Will our society 's ethics ever allow that ? " It 's a serious question , and I respect our opponents , " he says . " It 's a healthy debate that we 'll need to have as this research progresses . <p> " The fact is , we have a long way to go , " Dr. Sachs continues . " Many years . But when you see what an organ transplant does for a person , that 's what drives us onward . It 's why I went into medicine : to help people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> We stop in a hallway outside one of the center 's operating rooms , in front of a bulletin board . " This is what people do n't realize , " says Dr. Sachs , gesturing to a poster that says , " Animal research has added 28 years to the average human 's life . " <p> " Someday , we 'll be able to grow new organs from our own cells . But until then , xenotransplantation will save a lot of lives . " OCTOBER 26 , 10:42 PM <p> Dad was wheeled into an operating room . His upper body was stripped and coated with a yellow antiseptic . Sheets were placed over his head and legs , and a sticky , clear surgical film was taped over his abdomen . It would minimize the risk of infection and help hold the tissue together as the surgeons cut . <p> Twenty minutes later , the first incision was made . It went from the base of the neck to the top of the groin . Two surgeons worked at once , using an electric knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little bleeding , but lots of smoke . The room smelled like burning flesh . <p> Next , the surgeons made four horizontal cuts across the abdomen-two on each side  --  and peeled back the skin . Then , using a pneumatic saw , one of the surgeons cracked the sternum in two , placed a retractor between the pieces , and turned a hand crank . The rib cage parted , revealing the abdomen . The lungs expanded and contracted . The heart beat . A display above the operating table listed my father 's vital signs : blood pressure , 101/60 ; pulse , 100 ; breaths per minute , 10 ; oxygen saturation , 100 percent . <p> The surgeons did their first visual inspection of his organs . An ideal liver is maroon . Dad 's was brownish with sharp edges , but in good shape overall . His pancreas was covered with fat and could not be transplanted . The would-be recipient , who was being prepped in an adjacent operating room , would have to wait for another chance . The kidneys were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Readying the organs for removal is intricate work . The surgeons have to trim everything that connects them to the body  --  except , of course , the arteries and vessels that are still circulating blood . Intestines could get in the way of this work , so they were wrapped up  --  all 25 feet  --  in a sterile cloth . <p> Surgeons also cut out eight lymph nodes and sent them to the lab for analysis . Lymph nodes are loaded with white blood cells , which carry human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) . Dozens of different molecules make up a person 's HLA profile  --  it 's your genetic fingerprint . <p> A 50-year-old woman and a 69-year-old man , both of whom had been on dialysis for more than a year , were the leading candidates to receive Dad 's kidneys . They shared his blood type , but it was their HLA profiles that would determine whether they got the organ . Kidneys are ultrasensitive to compatibility issues , so the closer the HLA profiles , the less the chance of rejection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 hours . Hearts and lungs , on the other hand , must be transplanted within 4 hours , and livers within 12 . Because kidneys fare so well on ice , procurement coordinators can take more time picking the recipients . <p> THE INCUBATOR LOOKS LIKE a stainless-steel minifridge . Inside , says Mark Furth , Ph.D. , may be the cure for heart disease , which affects 65 million Americans . <p> Furth opens the incubator slowly , revealing a . blood vessel ? Yes , says Furth , but not just any blood vessel . This one 's been grown in a lab , from human cells . A liquid is coursing through it , much as blood would . <p> " Say you have a blockage in an artery , " explains Furth , the technology-development officer at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine . " Your doctor takes a few cells from you and grows an entirely new vessel . It 's transplanted into you , and you 're fine . It 's made from your own cells , so it 'll never be rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that is , growing human body parts outside the body . Most likely , it 'll be the technology that eventually solves the world 's organ-shortage problem . <p> The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine , one of many labs around the country specializing in the technology , is trying to grow hearts , livers , lungs , kidneys , and more . And it 's already had a major breakthrough : bladders . When a person 's bladder fails , says Anthony Atala , Ph.D. , the institute 's director , surgeons traditionally build a new one from intestinal tissue . " The problem is that intestines are designed to absorb , " says Atala , " whereas bladders are designed to excrete . That creates a lot of problems later in life : electrolyte abnormalities , gallstones , and , because you 're mixing two kinds of tissues together , cancer . " <p> So , about 16 years ago , Atala had a revelation . When any part of the body suffers an injury , cells multiply to heal the wound . " We thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? " <p> After years of trial and error , Atala discovered that the cells on the inside surface of the bladder , called epithelial cells , have the ability to multiply outside the body  --  under the right conditions . So to grow a new organ , he layers these cells on a bladder-shaped scaffold . It sits in an incubator for a week , then he implants it into the patient . Within a couple of months , as the cells continue to multiply and the scaffold naturally degrades , the patient has a brand-new bladder . Atala has engineered bladders for seven patients so far , and all the organs are functioning well . <p> Of course , there 's a big difference between a bladder , which is essentially a balloon , and a solid organ like a liver or kidney . For one , Atala does n't have to create new blood vessels to keep his bladders oxygenated ; bladder walls are so thin , they can suck up enough oxygen from neighboring tissues . <p> Still , Atala is confident . " We think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If we can find them and get them to multiply outside the body , we think we can grow any organ . " OCTOBER 27 , 12:10 AM <p> " Cross clamp . " <p> This was the most critical part of the recovery . One of the surgeons sliced through my father 's aorta . The nurse released a cold preservation solution from two IV bags , and it was fed into the aorta and through the organs . The other end of the aorta was cut as well , allowing the blood in the organs to be suctioned away . The other surgeon poured a big bowl of ice into the abdominal cavity . The numbers on the video monitor  --  pulse , respiration , blood pressure  --  fell to 0 . <p> My father 's heart was cut out within 5 minutes . It would n't be transplanted , but his valves would be . His liver was next . It was immediately moved to a back table , where it was infused with more preservation solution , packed in ice , put in a cooler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee was waiting , already under anesthesia . The kidneys came out last . They were packed in a cooler and would be transplanted the next day . Before the gaping hole in my dad 's chest was closed and sutured , surgeons also extracted his prostate gland and bladder . Both would be used for research . <p> My father had now given his all . An hour and a half later , he was wheeled out of the operating room and to the morgue . The funeral was 3 days later . <p> BRYAN NELSON , the Philadelphia-region organ-procurement coordinator , would love to see a day when organs are grown in labs instead of recovered from the dead . " It 's hard to do this job longer than a few years , " he says . " Emotionally , it just drains you . " <p> On the summer night I meet up with Nelson , he 's working a particularly tragic case : A teenage girl lost control of her boyfriend 's car and hit a bridge abutment . She 'd been in intensive care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive , the girl 's family is huddled around her hospital bed . This is unusual . Most families leave after brain death is declared , as mine did . In this case , however , the girl 's mom and dad want to wheel her to the operating room and say their goodbyes there . <p> Meanwhile , Nelson is on the phone with Children 's Hospital in Pittsburgh . A surgeon there has an 11-year-old patient who needs a multivisceral transplant  --  liver , pancreas , kidneys , and intestines . The dead girl is a match . Nelson 's trying to figure out how soon the surgeon can reach Philadelphia , so he can set an O.R . time for the organ recovery . <p> A nurse hands Nelson the results of the girl 's latest blood work . Her lung function is worsening , so Nelson prescribes a steroid to improve it . The phone rings again . It 's Johns Hopkins . They 're coming for the heart , leaving in an hour . Nelson tells them to delay  --  Children 's Hospital wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , after midnight . Nelson goes to the girl 's room to encourage her parents to go home and get some sleep . They 're reluctant , and who can blame them ? It 's the last night they 'll have with their child . But Nelson assures them the recovery wo n't happen for at least 7 hours . He tells them he 'll call them in a bit , to wake them up . As they leave , the mom gives Nelson a hug . <p> " This job is part doctor , part travel agent , part diplomat , and part social worker , " says Nelson , who was previously a medevac paramedic . ( All coordinators have medical backgrounds . ) " Ultimately , though , I 'm the advocate for the family . I ca n't save their loved one , so I do everything possible to see that he or she lives on in someone else . I take it personally .

" He pauses , looks at all his paperwork and notes and blood vials in front of him , and sighs . " It takes a toll . " <p> Bill Morris knows that feeling . Morris spent 7 years running the donor program at the University of Rochester . He now runs the recipient program at the Starzl Institute , in Pittsburgh . " I handled more than 300 donors , and I remember every one , " he says . " I needed to get on the side where you see lives being saved . " <p> Morris continues , " One of my last donors was a 3-month-old baby girl . Her father lost his temper and shook her to death . I was a cop for 20 years , and I saw lots of horrible things . But nothing was worse than holding that baby in my arms after we took her heart and liver and kidneys and gave them to other kids .

And they 're so thankful . We overuse the word ' hero ' in this society , but every organ donor is a hero . Your dad is a hero to someone , trust me .

His herpes zoster virus had emerged from hibernation , covering his left leg your immune system keeps it in check . Lee 's immune system barely exists . <p> Lee was in the isolation ward at the Loma Linda Veterans Hospital , outside of Los Angeles . I put on scrubs and went to his room .

I know what he wants to say  --  that my dad saved his life , that my dad is a hero . But , honestly , I do n't want to hear it . I 'd like to think that my father is a hero for how he lived , for the lessons he taught me , not for how he died . He simply chose , in the end , to help his fellow man .

Consent , we presume <p> The U.S. transplant system is based on " express consent . " If you want to donate your organs , you sign a card and inform your loved ones , and you 're set . If you do n't make your preference known , your family can okay donation upon your death . However , with more than 94,000 Americans waiting for a transplant , some doctors are calling for a shift to " presumed consent . " <p> Presumed consent is popular in Europe .
