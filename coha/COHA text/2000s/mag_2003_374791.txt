I was the captain of the U.S. marathon team in the 1936 Olympics and a special friend of Jesse Owens ' . On the boat going to Germany , Jesse said to me , " I want to go up to the deck and exercise , but I do n't have any shoes . " So I said , " I do n't think my shoes will fit you . " But that did n't stop him . He tried to get a shoe on , but his foot was so large , it broke my shoe right in half . He apologized , and I got it sewed up . It cost me 50 , and I got a souvenir . <P> When I finished the marathon , Hitler waved to me , and I thumbed my nose at him . That 's my claim to fame . But Jesse told me , " Kelley , Hitler waved to me , and I waved back . " That 's actually what happened . When he won his fourth medal that day , after setting three world records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To everyone . Except for Hitler . The dictator looked almost unbeatable at the time , but Jesse 's victories upset his theory about an Aryan master race . Jesse Owens was the greatest track athlete we have ever had . But he was also a great hero for everybody concerned . I 'm proud to have been his friend . <P> Kelley , 95 , competed in 61 Boston Marathons , winning in 1935 and 1945.
