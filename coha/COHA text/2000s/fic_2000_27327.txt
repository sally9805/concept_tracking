Angel of Light Dappled by its movement among the branches of a Japanese cherry , the afternoon light entered the study unhindered by draperies or shades . It spilled through the long bank of windows behind the newly slipcovered sofa , warming the oak floor and quickening the air with the scent of freshly milled wood . Under the spell of the June light , a certain luster and radiance appeared to emerge from every surface . The tall chest , once belonging to Father Tim 's clergyman great-grandfather , had undergone a kind of rebirth . Beneath a sheen of lemon oil , the dense grain of old walnut , long invisible in the dark rectory hallway next door , became sharply defined . Even the awkward inscription of the letter M , carved by a pocketknife , could now be discovered near one of the original drawer pulls . But it was the movement and play of the light , beyond its searching incandescence , that caused Father Tim to anticipate its daily arrival as others might look for a sunrise or sunset . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long deprived of light or air , still incredulous that such a bright space might exist , and especially that it might exist for his own pursuits since retiring six months ago from Lord 's Chapel . As the rector of Mitford 's Episcopal parish , he had lived next door in the former rectory for sixteen years . Now he was a rector no more , yet he owned the rectory ; it had been bought and paid for with cash from his mother 's estate , and he and Cynthia were living in the little yellow house . Of course  --  he kept forgetting  --  this house was n't so little anymore ; he and his visionary wife had added 1,270 square feet to its diminutive proportions . Only one thing remained constant . The house was still yellow , though freshly painted with Cynthia 's longtime favorite , Wild Forsythia , and trimmed with a glossy coat of the dark green Highland Hemlock . " Cheers ! " said his wife , appearing in jeans and a denim shirt , toting glasses of lemonade on a tray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every afternoon , for what they called the Changing of the Light . He chuckled . " We must n't tell anyone what we do for fun . " " You can count on it ! Besides , who 'd ever believe that we sit around watching the light change ? " She set the tray on the table , next to a packet of mail . " We could do worse . " They thumped onto the sofa , which had been carted through the hedge from the rectory . " One more week , " he said , disbelieving . " Ugh . Heaven help us ! " She put her head back and closed her eyes . " How daunting to move to a place we 've never seen ... for an unknown length of time ... behind a priest who 's got them used to the guitar ! " He took her hand , laughing . " If anyone can do it , you can . How many cartons of books are we shipping down there , anyway ? " " Fourteen , so far . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 're mad as hatters ! " she said with feeling . During the past week , his wife had worked like a Trojan to close up the yellow house , do most of the packing , and leave their financial affairs in order . He , on the other hand , had been allowed to troop around town saying his goodbyes , sipping tea like a country squire and trying to keep his mitts off the cookies and cakes that were proffered at every turn . He had even dropped into Happy Endings Bookstore and bought two new books to take to Whitecap , a fact that he would never , even on penalty of death , reveal to Cynthia Kavanagh . She looked at him and smiled . " I 've prayed to see you sit and relax like this , without rushing to beat out a thousand fires . Just think how the refreshment of the last few weeks will help you , dearest , when we do the interim on the island . Who knows , after all , what lies ahead and what strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who knew , indeed ? " The jig , however , is definitely up , " she said , meaning it . " Next week ... " " I know . Change the furnace filter next door , weed the perennial beds , fix the basement step , pack my clothes ... I 've got the entire , unexpurgated list written down . " " Have your suit pressed , " she said , " buy two knit shirts  --  nothing with an alligator , I fervently hope  --  and find the bicycle pump for Dooley . " " Right ! " He was actually looking forward to the adrenaline of their last week in Mitford . " By the way , " she said , " I 've been thinking . Instead of loading the car in bits and pieces , just pile everything by the garage door . That way , I can check it twice , and we 'll load at the last minute . " " But it would be simpler to  --  " " Trust me , " she said , smiling . Barnabas would occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , left side . They 'd load the right side with linens and towels , the trunk would be filled to the max , and they 'd lash on top whatever remained . " Oh , yes , Timothy , one more thing ... stay out of the bookstore ! " She peered at him with that no-nonsense gleam in her sapphire eyes , a gleam that , for all its supposed authority , stirred a fire in him . As a man with a decidedly old-shoe nature , he had looked forward to the old-shoe stage of their marriage . So far , however , it had n't arrived . His blond and sensible wife had an unpredictable streak that kept the issues of life from settling into humdrum patterns . " Anything wonderful in the mail ? " she asked . " I do n't know , I just fetched it in . Why do n't you have a look ? " His wife 's fascination with mail was greater even than his own , which was considerable . William James , in his opinion , had hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are postmen , " James declared , " life will have zest . " " Oh , look ! Lovely ! A letter from Whitecap , and it 's to me ! " He watched her rip open the envelope . " My goodness , listen to this .... " ' Dear Mrs. Kavanagh , We are looking forward with great enthusiasm to your interim stay in our small island parish , and trust that all is going smoothly as you prepare to join us at the end of June . " ' Our ECW has been very busy readying Dove Cottage for your stay at Whitecap , and all you need to bring is bed linens for the two bedrooms , as we discussed , and any towels and pillows which will make you feel at home . " ' We have supplied the kitchen cupboards with new pots , and several of us have lent things of our own , so that you and Father Kavanagh may come without much disruption to your household in Mitford . Sam has fixed the electric can opener , but I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , ha ha . " ' Oh , yes . Marjorie Lamb and I have done a bit of work in the cottage gardens , which were looking woefully forlorn after years of neglect . We found a dear old-fashioned rose , which I hear your husband enjoys , and liberated it from the brambles . It is now climbing up your trellis instead of running into the street ! We expect the hydrangeas and crepe myrtle to be in full glory for your arrival , though the magnolias in the churchyard will , alas , be out of bloom . " ' Complete directions are enclosed , which Marjorie 's husband , Leonard , assures me should take you from Mitford straight to the door of Dove Cottage without a snare . ( Leonard once traveled on the road selling plumbing supplies . ) " ' Please notice the red arrow I have drawn on the map . You must be very careful at this point to watch for the street sign , as it is hidden by a dreadful hedge which the property owner refuses to trim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that would be meddling . " ' We hope you will not object to a rather gregarious greeting committee , who are bent on giving you a parish-wide luau the day following your arrival . I believe I have talked them out of wearing grass skirts , but that embarrassing notion could possibly break forth again . " ' When Father Morgan joined us several years ago , he , too , came in the summer and was expecting a nice holiday at the beach . I 'm sure you 've been warned that summer is our busiest time , what with the tourists who swell our little church to bursting and push us to two services ! We all take our rest in the winter when one must hunker down and live off the nuts we 've gathered ! " ' Bishop Harvey was thrilled to learn from Bishop Cullen how greatly you and Father Kavanagh were appreciated by your parish in Mitford !

Since childhood , I have loved the feel of a pen flowing over paper , and often get carried away . " ' We wish you and Father Timothy safe travel . " ' Yours sincerely , " ' Marion Fieldwalker , vestry member of St. John 's in the Grove , and Pres. Episcopal Church Women " ' P.S. I am the librarian of Whitecap Island Community Library ( 35 years ) and do pray you might be willing to give a reading this fall from one of your famous Violet books . Your little books stay checked out , and I believe every child on the island has read them at least twice ! ' " His wife flushed with approval . " There ! How uplifting ! Marion sounds lovely ! And just think , dearest  --  trellises and old roses ! " " Not to mention new saucepans , " he said , admiring the effort of his future parishioners . She drank from her perspiring glass and continued to sort through the pile . " Timothy , look at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursive ! " " Let me see .... " Definitely a new look in the handwriting department , and a distinct credit to Dooley Barlowe 's Virginia prep schooling . Miss Sadie 's big bucks , forked over annually , albeit posthumously , were continuing to put spit and polish on the red-haired mountain boy who 'd come to live with him at the rectory five years ago . " Hey , " he read aloud from Dooley 's letter , " I have thought about it a lot and I would like to stay in Mitford and work for Avis this summer and make money to get a car and play softball with the Reds . " " I do n't want to go to the beach . " " Do n't be mad or upset or anything . I can live in the basement with Harley like you said , and we will be fine . Puny could maybe come and do the laundry or we could do stuff ourselves and eat in Wesley or at the Grill or Harley could cook . " " I will come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about . " " Thanks for letting me go home from school with Jimmy Duncan , I am having a great time , he drives a Wrangler . His mom drives a Range Rover and his dad has a BMW 850 . That 's what I would like to have . A Wrangler , I mean . I 'll get home before you leave , Mr. Duncan is driving me on his way to a big meeting . Say hey to Barnabas and Violet . Thanks for the money . Love , Dooley . " " Oh , well , " said his wife , looking disappointed . " I 'm sure he wanted to be close to his friends .... " " Right . And his brother and sister .... " She sighed . " Pretty much what we expected . " He felt disappointed , himself , that the boy would n't be coming to Whitecap for the summer , but they 'd given him a choice and the choice had been made . Besides , he learned a couple of years ago not to let Dooley Barlowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . It was the business about cars that concerned him .... Dooley had turned sixteen last February , and would hit Mitford in less than three days , packing a bona fide driver 's license . " Knock , knock ! " Emma Newland blew down the hall and into the study . " Do n't get up , " she said , commandeering the room . " You 'll never believe this ! " His former part-time church secretary , who had retired when he retired , had clearly been unable to let go of her old job . She made it her business to visit twice a week and help out for a couple of hours , whether he needed it or not . " I do it for th ' Lord , " she had stated flatly , refusing any thanks . Though Cynthia usually fled the room when she arrived , he rather looked forward to Emma 's visits , and to the link she represented to Lord 's Chapel , which was now under the leadership of its own interim priest . Emma stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Y'all wo n't believe what I found on th ' Internet . Three guesses ! " " Excuse me ! " said Cynthia , bolting from the sofa . " I 'll just bring you a lemonade , Emma , and get back to work . I 've gobs of books to pack . " " Guess ! " Emma insisted , playing a game that he found both mindless and desperately aggravating . " A recipe for mixing your own house paint ? " " Oh , please , " she said , looking disgusted . " You 're not trying . " " The complete works of Fulgentius of Ruspe ! " " Who ? " " I give up , " he said , meaning it . " I found another Mitford ! It 's in England , and it has a church as old as mud , not to mention a castle ! " She looked triumphant , as if she 'd just squelched an invasion of Moors . " Really ? Terrific ! I suppose it 's where those writing Mitfords came from  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cotswolds , this place is up north somewhere . I had a stack of stuff I printed out , but Snickers sat on th ' whole bloomin ' mess after playin ' in the creek , and I have to print it out again . " " Aha . " " OK , guess what else ! " " Dadgummit , Emma . You know I hate this . " She said what she always said . " It 's good for you , keeps your brain active . " As far as she was concerned , he 'd gone soft in the head since retiring six months ago . " Just tell me and get it over with . " " Oh , come on ! Try at least one guess . Here 's a clue . It 's about the election in November . " " Esther 's stepping down and Andrew Gregory 's going to run . " She frowned . " How 'd you know that ? " " I have n't gone deaf and blind , for Pete 's sake . I do get around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma , hoping he did n't , " that the restaurant at Fernbank is openin' ' the night before you leave . " " Right . We 've been invited . " She thumped into the slipcovered wing chair and peered at him as if he were a beetle on a pin . Though she 'd certainly never say such a thing , she believed he was existing in a kind of purgatory between the inarguable heaven of Lord 's Chapel and the hell of a strange parish in a strange place where the temperature was a hundred and five in the shade . " Will you have a secretary down there ? " she asked , suspicious . " I do n't think so . Small parish , you know . " " How small can it be ? " " Oh , fifty , sixty people . " " I thought Bishop Cullen was your friend , " she sniffed . She 'd never say so , but in her heart of hearts , she had hoped her boss of sixteen years would be given a big church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it was , he trotted up the hill to Hope House and the hospital every livelong morning , appearing so cheerful about the whole thing that she recognized it at once as a cover-up . Cynthia returned with a glass of lemonade and a plate of shortbread , which she put on the table next to Emma . " I 'll be in the studio if anyone needs me . With all the books we 're taking , we may sink the island ! " " A regular Atlantis , " said Father Tim . " Speakin ' of books , " Emma said to his wife , " are you doin ' a new one ? " " Not if I can help it ! " He laughed as Cynthia trotted down the hall . " She usually ca n't help it . " He expected a new children 's book to break forth from his energetic wife any day now . Indeed , did n't she have a history of starting one when life was upside down and backward ? Emma munched on a piece of shortbread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have those letters ready for me to do on th ' computer ? " " Not quite . I was n't expecting you ' til in the morning . " " I 'm coming in th ' morning , I just wanted to run by and tell you all th ' late-breakin ' news . But , " she said , arching one eyebrow , " I have n't told you everything , I saved th ' best ' til last . " His dog wandered into the study and crashed at his master 's feet , panting . " If you say you already know this , I 'll never tell you another thing as long as I live . On my way here , I saw Mule Skinner , he said he 's finally rented your house . " She drew herself up , pleased , and gulped the lemonade . " Terrific ! Great timing ! " He might have done a jig . " He said there had n't been time to call you , he 'll call you tonight , but it 's not a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ... " He was thrilled that someone had finally stepped forward to occupy the rectory . He and Harley had worked hard over the last few months to make it a strong rental property , putting new vinyl flooring in the kitchen , replacing the stair runners , installing a new toilet in the master bath and a new threshold at the front door ... the list had been endless . And costly . " It 's a woman . " " I ca n't imagine what one person would want with all that house to rattle around in . " " How quickly you forget ! You certainly rattled around in there for a hundred years . " " True . Well . I 'll get the whole story from Mule . " " He said she did n't mind a bit that Harley would be livin ' in the basement , she just wanted to know if he plays loud rock music . " Emma rattled the ice in her glass , gulped the last draught , and got up to leave . " Before I forget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Internet  --  church bulletins ! You ought to read some of th ' foolishness they put out there for God an ' everybody to see . " She fished a piece of paper from her handbag . " ' Next Sunday , ' " she read , " ' a special collection will be taken to defray the cost of a new carpet . All those wishin ' to do somethin ' on the new carpet will come forward and do so . ' " He hooted with laughter . " How ' bout this number : ' Do n't let worry kill you , let th ' church help . ' " He threw his head back and laughed some more . Emma 's life in cyberspace definitely had an upside . " By th ' way , are you takin ' Barnabas down there ? " She enunciated " down there " as if it were a region beneath the crust of the earth . " We are . " " I do n't know how you could do that to an animal . Look at all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawned hugely and thumped his tail on the floor . " You wo n't even be able to see those horrible sandspurs that will jump in there by th ' hundreds , not to mention lodge in his paws . " Emma waited for an argument , a rationale  --  something . Did he have no conscience ? " And th ' heat down there , you 'll have to shave ' im bald . " Father Tim strolled across the room to walk her to the door . " Thanks for coming , Emma . Tell Harold hello . I 'll see you in the morning . " His unofficial secretary stumped down the hallway and he followed . He was holding the front door open and biting his tongue when she turned and looked at him . Her eyes were suddenly red and filled with tears . " I 'll miss you ! " she blurted . " You will ? " She hurried down the front steps , sniffing , searching her bag for a Hardee 's napkin she knew was in there someplace . He felt stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jelly doughnuts in the morning ! " " I 'll have jelly doughnuts , you 'll have dry toast ! We do n't want to ship you down there in a coma ! " She got in her car at the curb , slammed the door , gunned the motor , and roared up Wisteria Lane . For one fleeting moment , he 'd completely forgotten his blasted diabetes . * * * " I 'm out of here , " he said , kissing his wife . " Get him to leave something for the island breezes to flow through , darling . Do n't let him cut it all off . " " You always say that . " " Yes , well , you come home looking like a skinned rabbit . I do n't know what Joe Ivey does to you . " Considering what Fancy Skinner had done to him time and time again , Joe Ivey could do anything he wanted . * * * " Leavin ' us , are you ? " Joe ran a comb through the hair over Father Tim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leavin ' us in th ' lurch is more like it . " " Now , Joe . Did I preach to you when you went off to Graceland and left me high and dry ? " Joe cackled . " Thank God I come to m ' senses and quit that fool job . An ' in th ' nick of time , too . I 'm finally about t ' clean up what Fancy Skinner done to people 's heads around here , which in your case looked like she lowered your ears a foot an ' a half . " " My wife says do n't cut it too short . " " If I listened to what wives say , I 'd of been out of business forty years ago . Do you know how hot it gits down there ? " If he 'd been asked that once , he 'd been asked it a thousand times . There was hardly anything mountain people despised more than a " hot " place . " I 'm an old Mississippi boy , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Man alive ! " " Right there , " he said , as Joe started working around his collar . " Just clean it up a little right there , do n't cut it  --  " Joe proceeded to cut it . Oh , well . Joe Ivey had always done exactly as he pleased with Father Tim 's hair , just like Fancy Skinner . What was the matter with people who serviced hair , anyway ? He had never , in all his years , been able to figure it out . " I hear it 's a ten-hour trot t ' get there , " said Joe , clearly fixated on the inconvenience of it all . " Closer to twelve , if you stop for gas and lunch . " " You could go t ' New York City in less'n that . Prob'ly run up an ' back . " " There 's a thought . " Joe trimmed around his customer 's right ear . " I 'm gettin ' t ' where I 'd like t ' talk ... "  --  Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graceland . " " Aha . " " I ai n't told this to a soul , not even Winnie . " There was a long pause . Father Tim waited , inhaling the fragrance from Sweet Stuff Bakery , just beyond the thin wall . Joe 's sister , Winnie , and her husband , Thomas , were baking baklava , and he was starting to salivate . " You could n't ever mention this to anybody , " said Joe . " You 'd have to swear on a stack of Bibles . " " I ca n't do that , but I give you my word . " Joe let his breath out in a long sigh . " Well , sir , there towards th ' end , I got to where I thought Elvis might be ... " " Might be what ? " " You know . Alive . " " No ! " " I ai n't proud t ' admit it . Thing is , I was gettin ' in th ' brandy pretty heavy when I went up there . My sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty tight . Plus , their house ai n't exactly th ' Biltmore Estate when it comes to room , so ever ' once in a while , I 'd ride around after supper t ' give Vern and my sister a little time to theirselves . " " That was thoughtful . " " I took to lookin ' for Elvis ever'where I went , ' specially at th ' barbecue place , they all said he was a fool for barbecue . My sister , when she heard I was lookin ' to sight Elvis , she started pourin ' my brandy down th ' toilet . A man ca n't hardly live with somebody as pours ' is brandy down th ' toilet . " " That would create tension , all right . " Heaven knows , he 'd tried for years to get Joe to quit sucking down alcohol , but Joe had told him to mind his own business . Something , however , had happened in Memphis that sent his barber home dry as a bone . " Then one night I was drivin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe , Elvis would n't be cruisin ' through a drive-in pickin ' up a chopped pork with hot sauce , he 'd send somebody . So I said , if I was Elvis , where would I be at ? " Seem like somethin ' told me to go back to Graceland , it was about eleven o'clock at night , so I drove on over there and parked across th ' street with my lights off . I hate to tell you , but I had a pint in the glove department , and I was takin ' a little pull now and again . " Joe took a bottle off the cabinet and held it above his customer 's head . " You want Sea Breeze ? " " Is the Pope a Catholic ? " " First thing you know , I seen somethin ' at th ' top of the yard . There 's this big yard , you know , that spreads out behind th ' gate an ' all . It was somethin ' white , and it ... " - Joe cleared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aha . " Joe blasted his scalp with Sea Breeze and vigorously rubbed it in . " You ai n't goin ' to believe this . " " Try me . " Joe 's hands stopped massaging his head . In the mirror , Father Tim could see his barber 's chin quivering . " It was Elvis ... in a white suit . " " Come on ! " " Mowin ' ' is yard . " " No way ! " " I said you would n't believe it . " " Why would he mow his yard when he could pay somebody else to do it ? And why would he do it in a suit , much less a white suit ? And why would he do it at night ? " Joe 's eyes were misty . He shook his head , marveling . " I never have figured it out . " " Well , well . " What could he say ? " I set there watchin ' . He 'd mow a strip one way , then mow a strip th ' other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Push . " " How could he see ? " Father Tim asked , mildly impatient . " There was this ... glow all around him . " " Aha . " " Then , first thing you know ... " - Joe 's voice grew hushed- " he th'owed up ' is hand and waved at me . " Father Tim was speechless . " Here I 'd been lookin ' to see ' im for I do n't know how long , and it scared me s ' bad when I finally done it , I slung th ' bottle in th ' bushes and quit drinkin ' on th ' spot . " His barber drew a deep breath and stood tall . " I ai n't touched a drop since , and ai n't wanted to . " Father Tim was convinced this was the gospel truth . Still , he had a question . " So , Joe , what 's that , ah ... bottle sitting over there by the hair tonic ? " " I keep that for my customers . You do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . But tell me this ... any regrets about coming back to Mitford ? " " Not ary one , as my daddy used to say . It 's been a year , now , since I hauled out of Memphis and come home to Mitford , and my old trade has flocked back like a drove of guineas . Winnie gave me this nice room to set my chair in , and th ' Lord 's give me back my health . " Joe took the cape from his customer 's shoulders and shook it out . " Yessir , you 're lookin ' at a happy man . " " And so are you ! " said Father Tim . " So are you ! " After all , did n't he have a new haircut , a new parish , and a whole new life just waiting to begin ? * * * He could n't help himself . As the bells at Lord 's Chapel pealed three o'clock , he turned into Happy Endings Bookstore as if on automatic pilot . He had five whole minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wesley for a bicycle pump , since Dooley 's had turned up missing . " Just looking , " he told Hope Winchester . Hope 's ginger-colored cat , Margaret , peered at him suspiciously as he raced through General Fiction , hung a right at Philosophy , and skidded left into Religion , where the enterprising Hope had recently installed a shelf of rare books . He knew for a fact that the only bookstore on Whitecap Island was in the rear of a bait and tackle shop . They would never in a hundred years have Arthur Quiller-Couch 's On the Art of Reading , which he had eyed for a full week . It was now or never . His hand shot out to the hard-to-find Quiller-Couch volume , but was instantly drawn back . No , a thousand times no . If his wife knew he was buying more books to schlepp to Whitecap , he 'd be dead meat . He sighed . " Better to take it now than call long-distance and have me ship it down there for three dollars . " Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses . No doubt about it , Hope had his number . He raked the book off the shelf , and snatched Jonathan Edwards 's The Freedom of the Will from another . He noted that his forehead broke out in a light sweat . Oh , well , while he was at it ... He grabbed a copy of Lewis 's Great Divorce , which had wandered from his own shelves , never to be seen again , and went at a trot to the cash register . " I 'm sure you 're excited about your party ! " Hope said , ringing the sale . Margaret jumped onto the counter and glowered at him . Why did cats hate his guts ? What had he ever done to cats ? Did n't he buy his wife 's cat only the finest , most ridiculously priced chicken niblets in a fancy tinfoil container ? " Party ? What party ? " " Why , the party Uncle Billy and Miss Rose are giving you and Cynthia ! " " I do n't know anything about a party . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the biggest thing in the world to them . They 've never given a party in their whole lives , but they want to do this because they hold you in the most edacious regard . " " Well ! " He was nearly speechless . " When is it supposed to be ? " " Tomorrow night , of course . " She looked at him oddly . Tomorrow night they were working a list as long as his arm , not to mention shopping for groceries to feed Dooley Barlowe a welcome-home dinner of steak , fries , and chocolate pie . He mopped his forehead with a handkerchief . He 'd be glad to leave town and get his life in order again . " I 'll look into it , " he muttered , shelling out cash for the forbidden books . " And if you do n't mind , that is , if you happen to see Cynthia , you might not mention that , ah ... " Hope Winchester smiled . She would never say a word to the priest 's wife about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mention to him that Cynthia had dashed in only this morning to buy copies of Celia Thaxter 's My Island Garden , and the hardback of Ira Sleeps Over . * * * He knocked on the screen door of the small , life-estate apartment in the rear of the town musuem . " Uncle Billy ! Miss Rose ! Anybody home ? " He could n't imagine the old couple giving a party ; his mind was perfectly boggled by the notion . Rose Watson had been diagnosed as schizophrenic decades ago , and although on daily medication , her mood swings were fierce and unpredictable . To make matters worse for her long-suffering husband , she was quickly going deaf as a stone , but refused to wear hearing aids . " There 's aids enough in this world , " she said menacingly . He put his nose against the screen and saw Uncle Billy sleeping in a chair next to an electric fan , his cane between his legs . Father Tim hated to wake him , but what was he to do ? He knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , startled . " It 's me , Uncle Billy ! " " Lord if hit ai n't th ' preacher ! " The old man grinned toward the door , his gold tooth gleaming . " Rose ! " he shouted . " Hit 's th ' preacher ! " " He 's not supposed to be here ' til tomorrow ! " Miss Rose bellowed from the worn armchair by the refrigerator . Uncle Billy grabbed his cane and slowly pulled himself to a standing position . " If I set too long , m ' knees lock up , do n't you know . But I 'm a-comin ' . " " Tell him he 's a day early ! " commanded Miss Rose . " Do n't you mind Rose a bit . You 're welcome any time of th ' day or night . " Uncle Billy opened the screen and he stepped into the kitchen . The Watsons had cooked cabbage for lunch , no two ways about it . " Uncle Billy , I hear you 're giving ... well , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The old man looked vastly pleased . " Got a whole flock of people comin ' to see you ! Got three new jokes t ' tell , you 're goin ' t ' like ' em , and Rose is makin ' banana puddin' ' . " Father Tim scratched his head , feeling foolish . " Y ' see , th ' church give you ' uns a nice , big party an ' all , but hit seemed mighty official , hit was anybody an ' ever'body , kind of a free-for-all . I said , ' Rose , we ought t ' give th ' preacher an ' ' is missus a little send-off with ' is friends ! ' " The old man leaned on his cane , grinning triumphantly . " So we 're a-doin ' it , and glad t ' be a-doin ' it ! " " Well , now  --  " " Hit 's goin ' to be in th ' museum part of th ' house , so we can play th ' jukebox , do n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is , but  --  " " An ' me an ' Rose took a good bath in th ' tub ! " He had seen the time when Uncle Billy and Miss Rose could empty two or three pews around their own .... Miss Rose , in a chenille robe and unlaced saddle oxfords , stood up from her chair and looked him dead in the eye . He instantly wished for the protection of his wife . " I hope you did n't come expecting to eat a day in advance , " she snapped . " Oh , law , " said her mortified husband . " Now , Rose  --  " She turned to Uncle Billy . " I have n't even made the banana pudding yet , so how can we feed him ? " " Oh , I did n't come to eat . I just came to find out  --  " " You march home , " said Miss Rose , " and come back tomorrow at the right time . " Uncle Billy put his hands over his eyes , as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And what time might that be ? " shouted Father Tim . " Six-thirty sharp ! " said the old woman , looking considerably vexed . * * * His wife went pale . He felt like putting his hands over his own eyes , as Uncle Billy had done . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I did n't know how to say no . Uncle Billy is so excited .... They 've never given a party before . " " Why in heaven 's name did n't they let us know ? " " I think they invited everybody else and forgot to invite us . " " Lord have mercy ! " said his overworked wife , conveniently quoting the prayer book . They had collapsed on the study sofa for the Changing of the Light , having gone nonstop since five-thirty that morning . He had made the lemonade on this occasion , and served it with two slices of bread , each curled hastily around a filling of Puny 's homemade pimiento cheese . " I ca n't even think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and cheese into her mouth . " My blood sugar has dropped through the soles of my tennis shoes . " Ah , the peace of this room , he thought , unbuttoning his shirt . And here they were , leaving it . They built it , and now they were leaving it . Such was life in a collar . " Timothy , are you really excited about going to Whitecap ? " " It comes and goes in waves . One moment , I 'm excited- " " And the next , you 're scared to death ? " " Well ... " " Me , too , " she confessed . " I hate to leave Mitford . I thought it would be fun , invigorating , a great adventure . " She lay down , putting her head on one of the faded needlepoint pillows that had also made it through the hedge . " But now ... " Her voice trailed off . " We 're pretty worn out , Kavanagh . This is a stressful thing we 're doing , pulling up stakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . But we 'll get there and it will be terrific , wait and see . You 'll love it . The freedom of an island ... " " The wind in our hair ... " " Gulls wheeling above us ... " " The smell of salt air ... " It was a litany they 'd recited antiphonally over the last couple of months . It always seemed to console them . He pulled her feet into his lap . " How about a nap ? We 've got a tight schedule ahead . " " Tonight , " she said , " Puny helps us clean out all the cabinets .... Dooley comes tomorrow evening just before the Watson party , and will have supper with his mother . Then a day of shopping with our threadbare boy and moving him in with Harley , followed by your meeting with the new tenant , and Dooley 's steak dinner . Then , of course , there 's the grand opening at Lucera on Thursday night after we finish packing the car , and on Friday morning we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breathless , " that we 'll have time to celebrate your birthday . " His birthday ! Blast ! This year , he would be sixty-six , and just think-in four short years , he would be seventy . And then eighty . And then ... dead , he supposed . Oh , well . " Do n't be depressed , " she scolded . " And for heaven 's sake , dearest , relax . You 're sitting there like a statue in a park . " " Right , " he said , guzzling the lemonade . He had noted over the last few days that the late June light reached its pinnacle when it fell upon the brass angel . Because of the exterior overhang of the room , the direct light moved no higher than the mantel , where the angel stood firm on its heavy base of green marble . He had found the angel in the attic at Fernbank , Miss Sadie 's rambling house at the top of the hill , now owned by Andrew and Anna Gregory . Only months before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter about the disposition of her family home and its contents . One thing she asked him to do was take something for his own , anything he liked . As Cynthia rambled through Fernbank seeking her portion of the legacy , he had found the angel in a box , a box with a faded French postmark . Though the attic was filled with a bountiful assortment of inarguable treasures , he had known as surely as if someone had engraved his name upon it that the angel in a box belonged to him . The light moved now to the angel , to its outspread wings and supplicating hands . It shone , also , on the vase of pink flowering almond next to the old books , and the small silhouette of his mother , which Cynthia had reframed and hung above the mantel . As long as he could remember , he 'd been afraid to sit still , to listen , to wait . As a priest , he 'd been glad of every needy soul to tend to ; every potluck supper to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fray and haste . He 'd been frightened of any tendency to sit and let his mind wander like a goat untethered from a chain , free to crop any grass it pleased . He was beginning to realize , however , that he was less and less afraid to do what appeared to be nothing . In the end , he was n't really afraid of moving to Whitecap , either ; he 'd given his wife the wrong notion . He had prayed that God would send him wherever He pleased , and when his bishop presented the idea of Whitecap , he knew it was n't his bishop 's bright idea at all , but God 's . He had learned years ago to read God 's answer to any troubling decision by looking to his heart , his spirit , for an imprimatur of peace . That peace had come ; otherwise , he would not go . He inhaled the freshness of the breeze that stole through the open window , and the fragrance of oak and cherry that pervaded the room like incense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , he put his head back and closed his eyes , and slept .
