After Greece 's victory in the European Championship this year , Cinderella stories were becoming the norm in soccer . But nobody could have predicted the fairy tale unfolding in Olympic soccer . The valiant Iraq team kept up its march to fame last weekend , defeating Australia 1-0 to reach the semifinals . " It 's very important for the players , for the Iraqi people . After or before a match , they think only of the problems . Then for two hours they can forget , " said captain Abdul Wahab Abu Al Hail . Some of the team 's players come from trouble spots like Najaf . Ahmed Manajid , who says his cousin died in Fallujah fighting , declares that if he were not playing ball , he would be part of the resistance . The team 's defiance has n't stopped President Bush from using its success as campaign fodder . The players ' response has been blunt ; they are happy to be free to play but unimpressed by Bush 's taking credit . Asked what he would like to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Games , Al Hail had a simple message : " Get your troops away from my country . "  --  By Jennie James/Patras
