<p> Wilbur Ross is unknown to most Chicagoans , but he 's about to play a big role in the economic future of this area . <p> Through his WL Ross and Co. , the 64-year-old New Yorker purchased LTV Steel out of bankruptcy  --  an action that promises to revive a huge East Chicago , Ind. , steelmaking facility and about 1,500 jobs that go with it . <p> Who is this unexpected savior , and why are labor unions applauding his plan ? When I was seated next to Ross at a New York dinner in January , I was fascinated by his discussion of world economics . But I had no idea his strategy of buying assets at bargain- basement prices would hit so close to home . <p> At the dinner , Ross explained how a year earlier , in partnership with Daiwa Securities , he had purchased a bankrupt Japanese bank  --  virtually unheard of for an American investor . And he detailed how , in less than a year , he and his managers returned it to profitability . <p> Our talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of governmental failures . Ross noted that he was keeping a close watch for restructuring possibilities in that troubled economy . <p> In fact , that 's how WL Ross &; Co. operates : raising huge investment pools from professional investors and institutions to buy into and turn around institutions . <p> Said Ross , " Yes , it 's counterintuitive but that 's what our job is  --  we 're the eraser on Wall Street 's pencil . " <p> But LTV Steel ? In the midst of a global oversupply of steel , a 200 million-ton imbalance between supply and demand ? Throwing money at an industry where 21 U.S. steel companies have declared bankruptcy in just the last two years ? <p> It sounded crazy to buy LTV . But steel unions applauded . And one week later President Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel , giving Ross and his investors an immediate boost toward profitability . <p> Crazy ? Like a fox . Here 's what Ross has to say . <p> On steel tariffs <p> " Is n't that a happy coincidence ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariffs ? <p> " We 're in business of betting on judgment , and our judgment was there was a high probability that he would do something substantial . This time we happened to be pretty right . But you never know . We live in a world of gray , not black and white . We actually tried to get LTV to postpone the bankruptcy auction till after the tariff announcement , but they chose not to , so we took a shot . " <p> Ross explains that the mix of tariffs is especially beneficial to LTV . <p> " We focused on the probability that he would do something significant in flat-rolled because that is the main line of LTV . But we were n't sure what he 'd do on the other parts . As you 're probably aware , if anything , we 'd be a beneficiary of slabs coming in , because we have more finishing capability than steel-making capability . So letting a lot of slabs come in from Mexico and other places is better than we expected . We 're satisfied with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $80 million in cash to buy the assets of LTV and assumed $200 million of environmental liability over 10 years . That sounds like a lot of exposure , but it 's actually a " cap " on potential payouts , which removes some uncertainty over future costs . <p> And Ross ' group will arrange working capital borrowings of another $150 million , which will be secured by receivables and inventory . <p> Because Ross bought the assets out of bankruptcy , he and his group are relieved of other debt the company carried  --  and huge liabilities the old LTV faced for retirees ' health and pension benefits . Old union work-rule contracts are also history . <p> So why did the United Steelworkers of America put out a press release welcoming what it called " a new ally in the fight to win strong federal action to save the American steel industry " ? <p> On the unions <p> " We know the union well , and they know our management , " he said . <p> Ross explains that in the previous LTV bankruptcy , 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steelworkers who were seeking their health benefits . He 's also been active in restructurings of other steel companies . <p> " We 're glad that they are recognizing that the only good steel jobs are jobs with healthy companies  --  and it 's a shared labor/management job to make the companies healthy . <p> " That does n't have to mean lower wages , but people have to be realistic about benefits . And some of the feather-bedding work rules are a luxury that the industry ca n't afford any more . <p> " LTV uses 2.8 man hours per ton of steel produced . Nucor a low-cost domestic company uses only 0.9 man hours per ton . Most Asian steel companies are also under one man hour per ton . <p> " There 's nothing inherent in U.S. steel manufacturing that says it needs 2.8 man hours per ton . At the end of the day , it only endangers the company to have two-thirds of its man hours be unnecessary . <p> " The real lesson to be learned is that unions can overnegotiate and go too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they kill the goose that laid the golden egg . There 's a growing recognition in management and in labor that those days are gone . " <p> On the new LTV <p> And how will Ross make money in the worldwide glut of steel ? <p> " The old LTV had an all-in cost of around $400 a ton . But its products sell for $350 a ton . So old LTV was a hopeless proposition . " <p> What makes the new LTV different ? <p> " First , the old company had legacy costs for unfunded pension and retiree health benefits . Those are not our responsibility . Those costs added up to about $50 a ton , so right there you 're at break-even . <p> " Second , one of the problems with steel is that it 's both labor- and capital-intensive . LTV spent $5 billion on facilities , which are in good shape . No blast furnaces need relining until 2004 . And they turn out a high-quality product with some real competitive advantages , such as ( steel products that are ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were paying $120 million in interest annually on the debt they had to build those facilities . We paid only $80 million to buy the company  --  we have no debt on the fixed assets . <p> " And third , the old LTV had huge overhead , a Park Avenue office , big offices in downtown Cleveland . We 're going to have the office at one of the mills , not downtown . We do n't need it . Steel is not investment banking . You do n't have to impress people with your lobby . <p> " Bottom line : We believe we 'll be if not the lowest-cost producer , darn near it when we get ourselves up and running . " <p> On free trade <p> " I find it amusing , the chorus from all foreign governments over President Bush 's tariffs . <p> " Steel has always been a political commodity . Forty percent of all steel consumed in the world goes across a national border before it 's sold . Steel is very heavy in weight relative to its value , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many less-developed countries and Russia use steel exports as a means to acquire foreign currency , not for profit , and to provide jobs for their workers . So yes , they dump steel at lower than cost . <p> " The notion that the world of steel is free trade is nonsense . Every country protects its steel , except us . I do n't think it 's good national policy for us to export Americans jobs to Russia . <p> " I view this as President Bush 's second war on terrorism . This tariff is a war against economic terrorists , in the form of people dumping here . It 's high time he did so . I think he 's right on . " <p> I protest that Ross has benefitted from free trade laws that allowed him to move into Japan to buy his bank there , and I get a sharp response . <p> " This is n't protection . It 's the elimination of a poor trade policy . All Bush has done is enforce the WTO rules . He did n't even go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 40 percent tariff . All he went for is 30 percent . <p> " Our huge trade deficit is evidence we 've been living beyond our means . Without imports , our economy would have grown that much more . The implication is that we 're gradually starting to lose control over our economy . " <p> On survival of the fittest <p> " We 're gon na get LTV up and running , and try to get it as profitable as we can . <p> " Assuming we can accomplish that , it would be our intention to play a role in the subsequent consolidation of the industry . Since Bush did not go as far as his commission recommended in raising tariffs , more weak companies will go out of business . Economics is a Darwinian situation : weaker names get weeded out , and that 's fine . " <p> On the USW <p> " This is not an anti-union thing . We 're grateful for their support in the bidding process . We have chosen to recognize the union . But in buying it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-union , or with another union . We did n't because we believe the union wants the new LTV to succeed , and wants 3,000 people re-employed . <p> " It 's in everybody 's interest to get those people back employed , and a reasonable package of pay and work rules will accomplish that . We view the steel industry as a shared problem of management and labor . We 're in a global economy  --  with or without tariff barriers  --  and we have to operate in the real world .
