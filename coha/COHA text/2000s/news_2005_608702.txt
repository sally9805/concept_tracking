<p> Pamela Ginsberg was once invited to a bar mitzvah by one of her customers and danced the hora in the family circle . At the grocery store where she works as a butcher , she has blanketed part of a wall behind the deli counter with photos and hand-scrawled notes from the children she has treated to slices of turkey . When she serves customers , she stands beneath a flying wooden cow and pig  --  gifts from a man who could not get enough of her corned beef . <p> These are the reasons Ginsberg lists for why she likes working at the Brookeville Market in the District 's Cleveland Park neighborhood . <p> " It 's my life , " said Ginsberg , who is also the store 's kosher and specialty foods buyer . " These people are my customers , but they treat me like family . " <p> But no pension or 401(k) plan comes attached to her job . She is 41 and has $7,000 in the bank . Her annual salary of about roughly $40,000 might seem reasonable for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , but increasingly Ginsberg frets about what her finances will look like when she stops carving cutlets and chopping prime rib . <p> She has reason to be concerned . A review of Ginsberg 's finances by three local financial planners indicated she needs to make big changes right away , cutting out her few indulgences , and investing as much of her income as possible . Even then , they say , she is likely to run out of money and be dependent on her Social Security check . <p> Since President Bush first outlined his plan to partially privatize Social Security , Ginsberg said , she has followed the debate attentively , aware that she is in the age group most likely to be caught in the middle  --  too young to be protected from benefit cuts , too old to fully bounce back if private accounts do n't generate the expected returns . <p> " I 've read everything I can get my hands on , " Ginsberg said , noting that her perceptions about retirement were shaped by seeing her mother live comfortably on Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grew up thinking I would have Social Security to live on . " <p> According to her latest Social Security statement , if Ginsberg continues working until age 65 , she can expect to receive $950 a month , just shy of today 's average monthly Social Security benefit of $955 . That is enough to cover the rent she presently pays for a one-bedroom apartment in Adams Morgan , but it would leave her short for food , utilities and other necessities . Retirement planning , Ginsberg acknowledges , has suddenly become an urgent matter . <p> In that she is not alone . As of 2001 , a federal analysis of households with at least one worker from age 21 to 64 concluded that 28 million  --  more than one-third of the total  --  did not have a retirement savings account of any kind . The study , released in 2003 , relied on Census Bureau and Federal Reserve data . <p> From now to the time she retires , Ginsberg and millions of others may be asked to absorb the benefits cuts and tax increases many experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solvency of a Social Security system projected to fall short by 2041 of the money needed to pay 100 percent of expected benefits . Bush has said that any changes to Social Security will preserve the existing system for anyone 55 or older ; for others , the debate could change the way they plan for the future . <p> What do the financial planners say Ginsberg can do to retire comfortably ? Would private accounts help her ? <p> Mary A. Malgoire of the Family Firm in Bethesda and Stuart Ritter of T. Rowe Price in Baltimore came up with general advice . Alexandra Armstrong and associates at Armstrong , MacIntyre &; Severns in the District ran detailed projections based on three different scenarios . <p> All three agreed Ginsberg has to make changes now if she wants to maintain her standard of living in retirement . Though they estimated she has only $7,000 in disposable income each year , after taxes , rent and utilities , they said she needed to begin saving and investing in the stock market . <p> She is free of debt and can eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to tuck away at least a few thousand dollars a year  --  at least 10 percent of her income . Malgoire suggested she immediately put $6,000 of her savings into a high-growth equity mutual fund . <p> A $200 monthly cell phone bill , and splurging on good food at local restaurants are her only indulgences , Ginsberg said . Her utilities range from $100 to $250 a month , depending on the season . She says she spends about $100 a month on miscellaneous items such as cleaning supplies and clothes . Her typical uniform at work consists of a baseball cap , T-shirt and baggy chef pants over black sneakers . When she is feeling fancy , she throws on a monogrammed chef 's jacket . <p> She vacations once a year at most , and only if she has the cash . <p> " It 's clear money is tight for her , but somehow she needs to figure out a way to start saving more , " Ritter said . <p> They disagreed , though only slightly , on whether a private Social Security account would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest part of their Social Security payroll tax in stocks and bonds . <p> Ritter said there are too many variables to say for sure whether that would make a difference to someone in Ginsberg 's situation , while Malgoire and Armstrong said it 's unlikely to help much , if at all . <p> " Social Security , as inadequate as it may be , may be the only sure income stream for Pam at her retirement , and I would not recommend that it be subject to the risks of the market , " Malgoire said in an e-mail . " It is just not true that every 20-year period in the markets has been a positive experience for investors . Perhaps the government would like to offer a guaranteed 4 to 5 percent return on these accounts . Then I could consider this option for Pam . " <p> Ginsberg shares certain traits with many of those who do n't have retirement savings . She is not married . She does n't own a home and does n't hold a college degree . <p> Married couples , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own an individual retirement account , the Congressional Research Service reported . Homeowners are three times as likely . And IRA ownership increases with education and income level . <p> But many of those who own retirement accounts have made only modest headway . Among the 47.5 million households with a working adult who owns either an IRA , Keogh , or 401(k) plan , the median balance of those accounts was $27,000 , a little more than $1,000 a year if spread over a 20-year retirement . <p> The savings " would not by themselves provide an income in retirement that most people in the United States would find to be adequate , " the CRS study concluded . It noted that for older workers , ages 55 to 64 , their retirement savings would provide about $408 a month in extra income . <p> Ginsberg said she never gave her financial future much thought before . Her father died at age 52 , her mother at 65 , and " I never thought I would live to see 59 , " she said . <p> Her work has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unease when she thinks about how much longer she can continue in such a physically demanding trade . The daughter of a Washington area butcher , she broke her first side of beef at age 7 while standing on a milk crate , and she has been in the food business ever since . <p> In 1995 , working at a restaurant in New Orleans , she stepped into a five-gallon vat of tomato-based zucchini soup that had just come off the stove and was stored in the wrong place . She spent several weeks in a burn unit and lost 40 percent of her left foot . For three years she subsisted on worker 's compensation . <p> Three years ago , she had back surgery . While she tries to avoid lifting heavy loads , she still hoists 40-pound slabs of beef from the walk-in locker to her work area . When delivery trucks arrive Monday and Thursday , she often finds herself hauling boxes . <p> At one point , several years back , she started a retirement savings account and managed to put away $3,200 . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While she was out , she cashed out her retirement savings to cover expenses . <p> While agreeing that Ginsberg needs to begin saving , the three planners split on some other key aspect 's of Ginsberg 's finances . <p> Ginsberg , for example , is not eager to take on a mortgage , especially in the current skyrocketing housing market . She ca n't afford anything in her neighborhood , where a one-bedroom condo runs upwards of $300,000 . And because of her hours  --  she often does n't get off until 9 p.m.  --  she would like to stay within walking distance of the store . <p> Armstrong and Ritter agreed , and said that while many American households benefit from the wealth that appreciating home values provide , buying a home is not necessary for a secure retirement . Ginsberg is better off leaving her savings liquid in case of emergencies , Ritter said . <p> " She is fine not doing it , " he said . " People are under the impression you have to own a house to retire . A house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own business is one way . " <p> Malgoire disagreed , saying that Ginsberg could get government help to buy a house , " though she probably wo n't be able to live in Adams Morgan . " <p> " It seems very hard to live on $40,000 a year in Adams Morgan , " said Malgoire , whose clients typically have minimum assets of at least $1 million . <p> The planners also disagreed over whether Ginsberg should follow through on a desire to start her own business . She would like to open a high-tone market with gourmet foods , and tables to sit and eat . She said two would-be investors have discussed the project with her , but it has n't worked out yet . <p> Armstrong and Ritter said that as long as she includes investors in the venture , it might be a good idea , and would even support her borrowing money to get it off the ground . <p> " Another option is to find somebody else who has a business and in five to 10 years is looking to sell to someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can manage the transition that way , it accomplishes her goal without a huge capital investment . " <p> Malgoire was adamantly against the idea . " It 's way too risky for her to do it on her own , " she said . As an alternative , she suggested that Ginsberg get a job with a unionized supermarket such as Giant Food or Safeway so she can have better pay and healthy benefits . <p> But working for a corporate supermarket  --  without flying cows or bar mitzvah invitations  --  does n't appeal to Ginsberg . <p> More to her liking , she said , is Ritter 's suggestion that she not really retire . She could work part time in a job that is less physically demanding than her current one , a tactic many older Americans are pursuing , and one that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has encouraged . <p> Ginsberg , who already puts in guest appearances at cooking classes , said she would be open to teaching . " I 've always worked . There is no way I would stop working and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong cautioned that even if she makes sacrifices , saves steadily , and earns a good return on her money , Ginsberg may run out of cash before she reaches age 81 , the current life-expectancy for American women . Under three different scenarios , Armstrong assumed Ginsberg saved $4,000 annually , and earned an aggressive investment return of 8.4 percent , but received different Social Security benefits . Even with private accounts factored in , she projected Ginsberg would run out of money between age 76 and 78 , leaving her to survive on her Social Security check alone . <p> " It does n't appear the private account affects her much , " Armstrong said . <p> On a recent evening , Ginsberg digested the planners ' recommendations over a cocktail and a bowl of bisque at a French restaurant a few blocks from her home . <p> " What am I going to do about it ? " she said . " I 'm just one tax-paying citizen . . . . I will have to think about retirement more than I have . I mean , hindsight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " <p> Ginsberg said the 8.4 percent rate of return Armstrong believes she can earn did make her more inclined to invest . She already has her eye on at least one stock . She noted that Smithfield Foods , the Smithfield , Va. , pork processor and hog producer , earned $98 million dollars for the third quarter of 2004 . <p> " I was out of my mind for not buying Smithfield stock , " she said . ( Her instincts may be good : Smithfield stock has roughly tripled in the past five years . ) <p> Ginsberg was less enthusiastic about the austerity measures she would need to undertake to save enough money to last her into her old age . <p> " What am I going to do ? Go home everyday ? " she said . " Life is too short . " <p> " I do n't think I 'm going to live that long , " she said . " But I guess I have to think like I am in case I do . "
