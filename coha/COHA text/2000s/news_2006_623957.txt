<p> Emily Morse , who spends much of her time interviewing people about their sex lives , is painfully aware that she 's being interviewed . <p> " I guess it 's like how most people are afraid of doing things  --  I 'm afraid of not doing things , " she says , punctuating her sentences with laughter and modifying phrases . " I like challenges . Oh , God , does that sound OK ? " <p> Since Morse , 35 , moved to San Francisco in 1992 after double majoring in psychology and political science at the University of Michigan , she 's worked on two mayoral campaigns , made an award-winning documentary , spent a year backpacking through Asia , starred as Caveh Zahedi 's girlfriend in the indie film " I Am a Sex Addict , " appeared in Pac Bell commercials , joined the board of the Film Arts Foundation , gotten her picture taken at countless society events and now placed her podcast interview show , " Sex With Emily , " on a local affiliate of CBS ' Infinity Broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , entails focusing on finding what she loves . " I know this sounds a little ... " Morse trails off , her rapid-fire delivery failing her for a moment . She is a small person with a big presence , with regular features , straight brown hair and an enviable figure . <p> " I do n't know , cheesy , but it 's true  --  I want to be doing things that touch a lot of people . I 've always been interested in sharing stories . When people talk to me and tell me about themselves , either in the documentary or in a podcast , it feels really good . " She pauses again , then laughs . " Is that OK to say ? " <p> Born and raised in the Detroit suburb Farmington Hills , Morse came to the Bay Area after college during the much-touted " Year of the Woman " in politics . After spending time in Washington , D.C. , as a congressional aide , she thought it would make sense to move to the part of the country that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Migden . Morse worked for Boxer and others before helping out with Willie Brown 's mayoral campaign in 1995 . <p> It was the campaigning , not the governing , that drove her interest in politics . " I loved being on the streets , talking to people , " Morse says . " After each election , I would be offered a chance to work in the administration , and I just could n't stay . " <p> " She lasted , like , a week , " remembers P.J. Johnston , Brown 's campaign manager , who went on to work in City Hall for a number of years and now does private consulting . " She was hired to essentially be one of the political directors , and she had great insight into San Francisco politics , particularly women 's issues , " Johnston says in a phone interview . " But she wanted to do something completely different . Emily is certainly not afraid to make 180-degree turns , in career and in life . " <p> After leaving the Brown administration in 1996 , Morse went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent meditation thing , you know , " she says . " I learned a lot . " <p> Diving into things is pretty standard for Morse  --  " I 'm not driven by security "  --  so when she got an idea to make a documentary about politics in San Francisco before the 1999 mayoral race , she went with it . <p> " I did n't know anyone in the film world , I did n't know the terminology . They told me I needed to find a cinematographer , and I was n't even sure what that was , " she says . " I did n't know anything about making a movie . But I did love documentary films . " <p> She had a meeting with Brown to secure his permission to follow him around with a video camera  --  " keep in mind this was before ' Survivor , ' before reality TV hit "  --  and then had to find a crew . <p> " Yeah , I 'm a big fan of learning on the job , " Morse says , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a San Francisco nonprofit that gives resources to independent filmmakers , she found cinematographer Tony Saxe and co-director Kelly , and started filming . <p> Then , Morse had a stroke of good luck : The mayoral race went from a rather boring romp by the entrenched Brown into a photo-finish horse race with write-in candidate Tom Ammiano , the San Francisco supervisor who had galvanized <p> the city 's progressive citizenry . <p> " Once Tom got in the race , it shaped the arc of the film , " says Morse , who ultimately titled it " See How They Run . " As with political documentaries such as " The War Room " and " Journeys With George , " Morse 's access to the politicians engendered a behind-the-scenes look at the process while showing how other media outlets covered the story . <p> " The story really became about how voters think , what brings them to the polls , " Morse says . <p> As anyone involved in film can tell you , though , shooting the movie is just the beginning . After taking 110 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year editing it down to a lean 60 minutes . Then came the money-raising efforts , followed by publicity and marketing , and then successful showings at film festivals in 2002 . <p> " The film took up four years of my life , and I still deal with requests to show it , or do interviews about it , " she says . " I mean , I 'm so proud of it , it 's like my baby , but also , I 'm over it . <p> " I wonder , if I 'd known what it would take , whether I 'd do it again . " She answers her own question immediately : " Yes , of course I 'd do it , I love it . " <p> After " See How They Run , " Morse found herself fielding offers to do more film and television , and not just behind the camera . In addition to an acting job on last year 's " I Am a Sex Addict , " Morse got an agent and joined the Screen Actors Guild . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television work as a model . <p> " It 's funny , now , to be in modeling  --  you know , I 'm 35  --  but I like doing a million different things . And I get paid . " <p> Morse , though , is n't a director who wants to act . Rather like Zelig , she 's found herself involved in what could be the Bay Area 's Next Big Thing : podcasting . <p> Along with technical producer Elizabeth Morse ( no relation ) , she has been making an audio show ( segments are posted on the Web for downloading ) called " Sex With Emily " since August 2005 . She finds someone to interview for an hour about sex , love , marriage , relationships and lots of things in between , and edits the show into 30-minute chunks . The show has had about 150,000 downloads and caught the eye of a radio producer at Infinity Broadcasting , which aired the show at 11 p.m. last Saturday on KIFR-FM , which calls itself 106.9 Free . Plans on when it will air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has attracted attention from television producers , Elizabeth Morse and Emily Morse are n't in any hurry to move it out of Internet radio format . " Podcasting was a great way to try out the idea and build an audience , " says Elizabeth . " It turned out to be great timing , " Emily adds . " The Bay Area is kind of ground zero for podcasting right now . " <p> The concept of the show grew out of conversation between the Morses , who met when Elizabeth was a production intern on the documentary . " After ' See How They Run , ' I knew I liked producing , I liked interviewing , I liked the journalistic side . And , " she says , glancing at her co-producer , " it seems like no matter where the conversation starts , people end up wanting to talk about sex and relationships . Really . " <p> " Sex With Emily " is a natural fit for the sex-positive Bay Area , home to other sexy podcasts by well-known experts such as Susie Bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade in lurid tales , she says , is that she 's not an expert . Her goal is to educate and entertain , but , like her listeners , she 's learning from her guests . <p> " Doing this show has made me realize that a lot of the information 's not out there . It 's like , where do you go or who do you talk to learn about this stuff ? " says Morse , her hands flying up in exasperation . " Girls can go to their girlfriends  --  like ' Sex and the City '  --  but if you want to hear about real people and real experiences , it 's hard . " <p> To make the show , Morse goes to Elizabeth Morse 's San Francisco house to record with a sound engineer . Elizabeth handles the technical side , Emily does the interview . Guests have included a recently divorced man talking about dating post-marriage ( " such an interesting perspective  --  he was really honest " ) , a phone sex worker ( " so much different than you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recurring guest named Captain Erotica , who fashions himself as helpful erotic superhero . <p> Although the show is called " Sex With Emily , " a listener wo n't learn much about Emily 's sex life . " I try to be open and connect with the person I 'm interviewing , but it 's really not about what 's going on with me . If it 's not germane to the conversation , I probably wo n't talk about my own life . " ( For the record , though , Morse is not married and goes on dates . We 're just saying . ) <p> Whatever direction the show takes  --  television , commercial radio , film  --  Morse promises to keep the focus on telling regular people 's stories . <p> " It 's about sex , for sure , but the focus tends to be on what really happens in relationships , like , after the wedding . We get people who are like , ' My husband and I only have sex once a week , is that normal ? ' " Morse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in this together , we all suffer in some way . There 's no such thing as a white picket fence , no perfect marriage . " <p> Elizabeth Morse adds : " We hear all the time about porn stars or celebrities having sex . We 're more interested in what regular people are doing . " <p> To hear Emily talk dirty  --  we mean , interview people about sex and relationships , check out her site : sexwithemily.com.
