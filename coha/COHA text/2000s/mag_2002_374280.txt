There once was a time when America celebrated corporate leaders rather than those who exposed corporate misdeeds , as in 1955 , when TIME named General Motors president Harlow Herbert Curtice man of the year : <P> Because of the success of the American economic system , the U.S. rolled through 1955 in two-toned splendor to an all-time crest of prosperity , heralded around the world . Much of this prosperity was directly attributable to the manufacture and sale of that quintessential American product , the automobile ... Production alone would not make Harlow Herbert Curtice , 62 , the Man of the Year . Nor would the fact that he is president of the world 's biggest manufacturing corporation  --  and the first president of a corporation to make more than $1 billion in net profits in a year . Curtice is not the Man of 1955 because these phenomenal figures measure him off as first among scores of equals whose skill , daring and foresight are forever opening new frontiers for the expanding American economy by granting millions to colleges , making new toasters that pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . Harlow Curtice is the Man of 1955 because , in a job that required it , he has assumed the responsibility of leadership for American business . In his words , " General Motors must always lead . "  --  TIME , Jan. 2 , 1956
