Globalization may be a fighting word in politics and business , but in the realm of music it has a nice ring to it  --  and a funky beat , and a tantalizing groove . Today musicians and listeners the world over are plugged into one another via the Internet , TV and ubiquitous recordings . The result is a vast electronic bazaar through which South African kwaito music can make pulses pound in Sweden , or Brazilian post-mambo can set feet dancing in Tokyo .

I wanted even the type to be lyrical , " she says . Photo editors Marie Tobias and Jessica Taraski complemented that voice by encouraging their subjects to have fun in the photographers ' studios .

Tobias and Taraski insisted that Fassie keep the boots on for the shoot , which she did , barely suppressing the impulse to dance in them to the strains of Aerosmith , which were blaring in the studio . <P> In addition to the offerings of
