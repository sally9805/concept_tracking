Yearning to Learn // I love golf as much for its frankness as for those rare occasions when it rewards a wink with a smile . It is pure , honest and immune to sweet talk . Neither can it be bum-rushed . You must court it slowly and patiently . Any other strategy will be met with a rebuff that for centuries has made grown men and women cry . // Golf does , however , show you moments of vulnerability . They are the reason we relish the courtship and the basis for our hope . It is that flicker of anticipation that draws us from the comfort of ambivalence to the certainty of rejection . Golf does not play favorites . Still we try . // I have been infatuated with the game since my pop first put a club in my hands when I was a toddler . I was an only child , and the club and ball became my playmates . That feeling of solitude and self-reliance enhanced the game 's attraction for me and endures today . I suspect that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game . I recall from conversations with two of the greatest golfers of our time  --  Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus  --  that the game had a similar appeal for them . Golf affords you supreme independence . The clich ? about the game being you against the golf course is only partly true . Ultimately , it is you against yourself . It always comes down to how well you know yourself , your ability , your limitations and the confidence you have in your ability to execute under pressure that is mostly self-created . Ultimately , you must have the heart and head to play a shot and the courage to accept the consequences . // Golf is a great mirror , often revealing things about you that even you did n't know . It can not be misled . Still we try . // Sometimes the game comes so easily you can hardly believe it . Every swing seems natural and unforced . Every shot comes off exactly as you envisioned it . That false sense of security is part of the seduction . Every golfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll admit never quite reaching nirvana  --  that feeling of invincibility . We are constantly on edge . There is no comfort zone in golf . Nor is it a game of perfection . If it were , we 'd all shoot 18 and look for a more challenging sport . I shot a 61  --  my lowest competitive round  --  in the third round of the Pac-10 Championships during my sophomore year at Stanford and bogeyed the par-4 14th hole . I actually hit the ball better during the afternoon round and shot four strokes worse , including a bogey at 15 . Only once do I recall feeling nearly in control of my game and that was when I shot a 13-under-par 59 at my home course in Orlando . Even then I parred both par 5s on the back nine with irons into the greens . The most we can ask of ourselves is to give it our best shot , knowing that sometimes we will fail . We are often defined by how we handle that failure . // The great Ben Hogan , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best week of golf he only had four perfect shots . I have yet to get to that higher plane . I won 12 times around the world in 2000 , including three majors , and I only remember hitting one shot I would call perfect  --  a 3-wood on No. 14 on the Old Course at St. Andrews in the third round of the British Open . From a tight lie I had to hit a little draw into a left-to-right wind and carry the ball about 260 yards to a green guarded by a couple of nasty pot bunkers . As with every shot I attempt , I visualized the ball 's flight and how it should respond upon landing . Because it was a blind shot , I picked out a crane in the distance as my target . The ball never left that line and the shot turned out exactly as I had planned . Moments like that stay fresh in my mind , providing a positive image for future reference . Those images are critical when the game is on . They may even be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems so difficult you wonder whether the effort is worth it . It took me a while to understand why some days you have it and others you do n't . Fact is , every day your body feels a little different and golf is such a finite game that a little off can translate into a lot . One or two degrees here and there can mean from four to seven yards . That 's not a whole lot but it 's magnified due to the precision the game demands . We 've all had one of those frustrating days . The final round of the 1996 NCAAs at The Honors Course in Ooltewah , Tenn. , was one I 'll never forget . I struggled all week , even though I shot some great numbers . I just did n't feel comfortable with my swing . I did n't have the club in the right position , but I was getting away with it because my chipping was great and I made every putt I looked at . I was somehow able to keep the ball in play for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . In the final round I lost it altogether . I went to the range that morning and never hit a shot . It just was n't there . Sometimes when that happens you can actually lower your expectations , go out and shoot a great round . Not this time . I played the first three rounds with smoke and mirrors and it finally caught up with me . Fortunately , I had a nine-shot lead and the 80 did n't cost me an individual championship . I felt extremely fortunate , more like a survivor than a champion . // Success in golf is finding equilibrium , accepting the fact that it is a game of ups and downs and learning something every time you tee it up . Finding that balance is a matter of trial and error . You must discover what works best for you and work diligently to maximize your potential . The difference between golf and most other sports is that anyone of average intelligence and coordination can learn to play it well . It requires a commitment to being the best that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the game , for I , too , started as a blank page . Through my first teacher , my dad , the page began to fill . I absorbed as much information about the game as I possibly could . Through experimentation I started weeding out what could and could not hurt me . More important , I began to understand what worked best for me . Pop gave me many great lessons , not only about golf but also about life . His greatest advice to me was to always be myself . I pass that along to you as the first lesson in this book , which I wrote not as a panacea but as the ultimate tribute to Mom and Pop 's ideal of caring and sharing . In essence , if you care for someone you 'll share with them your most treasured possessions . // In this book I will share with you a lifetime , albeit a relatively short one , of knowledge about the greatest game in the world . I believe this book will assist you in attaining the deep joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am convinced there is no game like it . In many ways it is a microcosm of life , teaching us both the depths and heights of character . It demands integrity , promotes camaraderie , encourages good health and builds appreciation for the aesthetics . It is more than a well-struck iron or a holed putt . No , golf is not a game of perfection ; it is one of reality . And keeping it real is more than a worthy goal in any endeavor. // Golf requires patience and perseverance . There are no shortcuts . Pop used to say you get out of it what you put into it . When my teacher , Butch Harmon , and I overhauled my swing during the 1998 season , Butch would sometimes have me repeat one movement for 30 minutes . I would get so tired it felt like my arms were going to fall off . But I kept at it until the move became ingrained in my muscle memory . Patience and practice pay off . So will careful attention to the techniques explained within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everyone seeking to get the best out of their games . It is structured differently from other books , beginning with the green and progressing to the tee . That 's how my dad taught me , from the smallest swing to the biggest . The instruction combines visual , kinesthetic , cognitive and performance ideals for practical application by players of all ages and abilities . Interspersed throughout the text are seven secrets I have used to elevate my game , from becoming physically stronger to mentally tougher . I believe they will work for you , too . // Ultimately , golf is a journey full of learning and discovering . I hope , through this book , you 'll discover your game  --  one that is powerful yet precise , consistent yet exciting , impervious to pressure yet yielding large doses of fun . After all , that 's the real reason we play the game . Sometime we forget that . I did once . I was a junior golfer playing in the Orange Bowl junior tournament in Miami . I had the lead going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine . I still had the lead , but for some reason I lost all joy and flat-out quit . I took my second-place trophy and pouted . Pop sternly reprimanded me . That 's the only time I ever quit on golf in my life . From that time on I realized what a privilege it is to play . And I never again lost sight of why I fell for the game in the first place . // We still try because we must . //
