Is it time to start worrying about the dumbing down of the Broadway musical ? The trend is alarming . Say what you will about the Brit-pop musicals that dominated Broadway in the 1980s and ' 90s , but shows like Les Miserables , Miss Saigon and Phantom of the Opera at least had big ambitions and tried to engage the audience emotionally . The Broadway hits of the past few years have been of a different , more frivolous sort . Most of them are aimed at kids ( The Lion King ) , or they hark back to old-fashioned eras with tongue planted in cheek ( 42nd Street , Thoroughly Modern Millie ) , or they have books that are too patently silly for any sentient adult to pay attention ( Mamma Mia ! ) . Even The Producers , for all its pleasures , gets much of its comedy from Friars Club jokes about big bazooms and limp-wristed homosexuals , gags that passed muster only because they came from a revered master , Mel Brooks . <P> So it 's fitting that the big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next huge hit . Its hype has been building for months , ever since a critically praised tryout in Seattle . Advance ticket sales have hit $14 million , one of the highest in Broadway history . <P> Based on John Waters ' 1988 cult film about a chubby teenager who dreams of winning a spot on an American Bandstand- like TV dance show , Hairspray takes us back to the era everyone loves to make fun of , the early 1960s . In theater-coiffure terms , we 're in the sweet spot between Grease and Hair . Movie composer Marc Shaiman ( South Park : Bigger , Longer &; Uncut ) makes his Broadway debut with a score that skillfully mimics the era 's perky pop ditties , and director Jack O'Brien has put together a slick , high-spirited production . Add to that a politically correct story line about a girl who fights to integrate the dance show , and you have an unbeatable combination : desegregation and doo-wop . <P> Hairspray certainly looks terrific . Scenery designer David Rockwell goes for wit and color ( prettiest in pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ klieg lights sprouts from the ceiling ; disembodied heads appear , Laugh-In style , inside big-haired pictures that wiggle back and forth . If this is eye candy , dish out more . <P> And though the show turns Waters ' subversive ( if rather slipshod ) movie into a feel-good sitcom , that 's mostly O.K. Waters based his story on a real Baltimore teen TV show of the late 1950s and ' 60s , and the naive outrage of Hairspray heroine Tracy Turnblad at the show 's race discrimination  --  blacks are relegated to a once-a-month " Negro day "  --  is satisfying in a storybook , wish-fulfilling way . As the chunky Tracy , Marissa Jaret Winokur is a buoyant fireplug who almost convinces us that she really can outdance everyone else onstage . ( Choreographer Jerry Mitchell helps by keeping the chorus kids in check . ) And Shaiman 's songs ( with lyrics co-written by Scott Wittman ) are fun , even if they never go much beyond parody . When the numbers are n't imitating the " ooh ! ooh ! ooh ! " squeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herman show music of the same era , as in a romantic soft-shoe duet , Timeless to Me , between Tracy 's parents .
