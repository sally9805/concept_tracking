Is bigger better ? That 's the hot debate in the world of  --  mutual funds . Some experts believe funds with fewer assets perform better , since managers can quickly buy and sell securities . Others say large funds , which have more resources for research and lower expense ratios , are best . Well , here 's a conversation stopper : size does n't matter . A new study by Andrew Clark , senior research analyst at fund tracker Lipper , finds that while small U.S. stock funds sometimes outperform large ones ( and vice versa ) , the bursts of superior returns last only for short periods , then disappear and often are n't statistically relevant  --  that is , they could happen by chance . So you still need to evaluate a fund by risk-adjusted return , expense ratio and manager experience .  --  B.K.
