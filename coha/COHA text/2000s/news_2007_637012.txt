<p> When Jimmy Sewell of Gillsville went to Kentucky last year to trailer a Ferrari 360 F1 Spider back to Atlanta for servicing , the owner asked Sewell , " Do you know how to drive a Formula 1 transmission ? " <p> " Yep , " said Sewell , " I 've got an F430 a Ferrari at home . " <p> When Sewell left , the steaming owner called Steven Eckhoff , general manager of S and W Sports Cars , the Ferrari dealer in Alpharetta . He said , " How come a expletive tow-truck driver has an F430 , and I 'm still on the waiting list ? " <p> " Because , " said Eckhoff , " he 's a better customer than you are . " <p> Sewell , it turns out , is not your everyday tow-truck driver . He 's a venture capitalist with interests ranging from tombstones to facial-recognition technology . Hauling super premium automobiles ( at $110,000 and up , you do n't call them cars ) is just a hobby . <p> " Gives me something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . " <p> For the record , Sewell also owns an Audi A8L ( a fetching little bauble itself with an MSRP of $126,320 ) , a 1991 Mercedes 550 SEC coupe , an Infiniti FX45 SUV and a pickup . And he traded the F430 last fall to make room in his garage for a new 620-horsepower 599 GTB Fiorano which , as Ferrari 's newest and most powerful production vehicle ever , Sewell absolutely had to have . <p> In fact , to get the 599 here in time for his 50th birthday , Sewell paid an extra $8,500 to have it flown to New York and trucked to Atlanta . The tab for his flaming red birthday present : $310,000 . <p> Owning a Ferrari , or any super premium automobile , says Sewell , " is a reward to remind you why you put up with the madness of making money . " <p> The biggest draw for such cars is exclusivity , says Eckhoff , whose dealership also sells Maseratis and Aston Martins . " These cars are made in limited numbers . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they want to be seen as more of an individual . " <p> Only 5,000 Ferraris and Aston Martins are built each year , along with 6,000 Maseratis and 10,000 Bentleys . Rolls-Royce expected to sell just 800 Phantoms in 2006 , 14 of which went to the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong . <p> Eckhoff says his customers range in age from 17 to 90 and include doctors , financial advisers , heads of companies and attorneys along with celebrities like songwriter/producer Dallas Austin . Former Atlanta Thrasher Dany Heatley was driving a Ferrari purchased at S and W when he had an accident in Buckhead that killed teammate Dan Snyder . <p> Karl Brauer , editor-in-chief of Edmunds.com , says the super premium segment of the market is growing and that the market has actually come down in price . <p> " It used to take at least $200,000 to get a super premium car , " Brauer says , " but now there are two Bentleys and two Aston Martins you can get for less than $200,000 . It 's become a far more crowded market than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has definitely opened up , " says Mike McElroy , general manager at Bentley Atlanta in Alpharetta . " There 's new money . . . a lot of business owners , entertainers and sports figures . " <p> A few days before Christmas , one of McElroy 's customers was Kordell Stewart , the former Pittsburgh Steeler who was looking to trade the Bentley Continental GT coupe he bought last summer for a Bentley Continental Flying Spur sedan . <p> Visiting a super premium showroom is unlike the tire-kicking experience most people are familiar with . The glassy black paint of a Continental GT is bathed in the glow of recessed overhead lights , enhancing a graceful crease in the sheet metal that curls up around the front fender , sweeps down the side and curves gracefully over and past the rear fender . <p> Nineteen-inch alloy wheels , wide tires and a silver , cross-hatched grill give the coupe an air of speed , power and effortless grace . <p> Inside , chrome controls and gear-shift knob glitter against black leather upholstery stitched with a special diamond pattern that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GT is a gleaming black Arnage T ( MSRP : $234,990 ) , the latest in an august line of saloons bespeaking wealth and gentility . <p> Just a few miles away in the S and W showroom , 18 Ferraris present a mind-bending display that includes an F430 F1 Spider , a 360 Modena , an F430 and a 612 Scaglietti . It is the ultimate adult toy store . <p> Matchbox toys come to life in brilliant reds , yellows and blacks . Seen from a certain remove , the sculpted intakes , swooping designs and low , wide stances give them the look of F22 Raptors on a flight deck , birds of prey awaiting launch . <p> In the next room , a stylish Maserati Quattroporte blends stylish Italian design with seating for four in a look that salesman Jerry Willey aptly describes as " noble . " <p> Although robots are used in the building of super premiums , much is still done by hand , and the impression of Old World craftmanship is the reason they are sometimes referred to as " garage art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood . Seams are stitched by hand . Paint is sanded by hand . <p> And then they are customized to meet the whims and fantasies of buyers whose preferences range far beyond merely choosing interior and exterior colors and sound system upgrades . <p> Buyers of the Rolls-Royce Phantom ( MSRP : $328,750 ) , for example , can have their hood ornament , called the Spirit of Ecstasy , cast in 24-carat gold . Initials can be stitched into the upholstery or inlaid into the veneer . A humidor can be installed in the glove compartment , and there are custom-made hampers and a safe for the boot , or trunk , as we call it in the States . <p> Opulent and artistic though the super premiums may be , they are still machinery  --  and high-performance machinery at that . <p> For his 50th birthday , Sewell trailered his new 599 to Virginia and spent the night at the renowned Inn at Little Washington . <p> The next day , he took the Ferrari out on the Blue Ridge Parkway and " let ' er rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar detector and a laser jammer , you 've got a real good chance of not getting caught , even in a bright red Ferrari . " <p> In the market : <p> Rolls-Royce Phantom ( MSRP : $328,750 )  --  The Phantom has an all-aluminum ( 6,749cc ) V-12 engine , the biggest aluminum spaceframe in the industry and " whisper valves " that almost silence the car during acceleration and while stationary . It also comes with button-operated rear coach doors . Says the R-R Web site , " You do n't just buy a Rolls-Royce : You commission it , like a piece of fine art or a super yacht . " <p> Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano ( MSRP : $265,295 )  --  An extremely fast two-seater with a 6-to-1 weight-to-power ratio ( 3,722 pounds , 612 horsepower ) , the new 599 is already being called one of the greatest Ferrari road cars ever . It has carbon-ceramic disc brakes ( an $18,550 option ) , a smooth , fast shifter , unique flying buttresses to enhance the aerodynamics and , oddly enough , a suspension originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $122,000-$125,000 )  --  The Quattroporte ( meaning " four-door " ) is a swift , sweet-driving front-engine , rear-drive sedan that 's at its best when driven in manual with the Formula 1-style paddle shifters on either side of the steering wheel . The ' 07 model debuting at auto shows this winter reportedly includes an improved automatic transmission . <p> Bentley Continental GT ( MSRP : $169,990 )  --  Edmunds.com calls it " the most exciting vehicle to wear that famous ' B ' emblem in 70 years " and " the best Bentley ever made . " It has a 552-horsepower , W-12 engine , all-wheel drive , a six-speed automatic transmission that can be set to sport mode and twin-turbo acceleration that will pleat your boxers . Hard to believe Bentley is owned by Volkswagen .
