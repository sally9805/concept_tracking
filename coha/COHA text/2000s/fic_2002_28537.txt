Chapter OneIf there was any correlation between bad luck with men and a poor sense of direction , Kate Neeson thought it might explain a whole lot about her life . She was lost . Again . She turned off the ignition and peered gloomily through the window of the rented Peugeot at the unfamiliar Irish countryside . Isolated cottages , stunted windswept trees and stone walls . Endless stone walls . Around the twists and turns of the road , she 'd caught glimpses of pale ocean merging into pale sky . Before the road started climbing again , she 'd heard the low roar of waves breaking . On the coast , obviously , but in Ireland that was n't much help . With a sigh , she reached for the map and spread it out over the passenger seat . Cragg 's Head , the village where she 'd arranged to meet a local reporter , was barely more than a dot on Connemara 's ragged coast . She 'd set up the meeting before she left the States , but had forgotten to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . On the map , the area looked like a piece of china , picked up and hurled to the ground in a tantrum . Moruadh had fallen from Connemara 's steep cliffs nearly a year ago . Kate tucked her hands under her arms , chilled by the damp air seeping into the car . Moruadh , the young Irish folksinger whose songs of love , doomed , lost and unrequited , rang uncomfortably true to life . Or at least to her own life . Moruadh was why Kate was in Ireland , but she did n't want to think about Moruadh right now . Specifically , she did n't want to think about Moruadh 's death . Tomorrow would be time enough for that . Tomorrow - after a decent night 's sleep - she would n't be plagued by a spooked feeling that had her glancing over her shoulder and checking door locks . Tomorrow , she would wear down the widower 's resistance . If Niall Maguire had something to hide , she would ferret it out . Reluctant interview subjects did n't discourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her shoulder , but a drifting fog only heightened the sense of isolation . Did anyone actually live in the west of Ireland ? With her palm , she wiped away condensation from the windshield and tried to decide whether to plough on , in the unlikely hope she was headed in the right direction , or turn back to the last village . Through the swirling air , she saw two figures out on a narrow footpath . She rolled down the passenger window to ask for directions , then changed her mind . Irish advice on such matters , she 'd discovered , was picturesque , convoluted and usually wrong . A car 's yellow hazard lights drew close , fog curling around the lamps like ghostly ballerinas . Out on the footpath , the two figures merged briefly . A moment passed and then the smaller of the two broke away and began to run . The tall one followed in swift pursuit , and both moved wraithlike in and out of the fog . When it cleared again , she saw only a tall , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the footpath as empty as if she 'd imagined the whole thing . Teeth chattering , she started the car . The tall one had done away with the small one , she decided . He was out there now looking for his next victim . A deranged woman hater . She could feel his eyes boring into her head . Probably deciding whether to drag her out of the car or just roll the car with her in it over the cliffs . Panicked enough to convince herself that the scenario might not be that far-fetched , she let out the clutch . The car shuddered to a halt . Cursing manual transmissions , she started the engine up again and let it idle for a moment . Her hands on the wheel were shaking . Get a grip . There 's no one out there . This is Ireland not Santa Monica . And then she looked up to see a man at the window . She screamed . His face , like an apparition in the swirling fog , was narrow with dark eyebrows and light gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open passenger window , evidently immobilized by her scream . Then , hands up at his chest , palms out , he slowly backed away from the window . " God , I 'm sorry , " he said . " I did n't mean to scare you . " Kate stared at him . Even as the adrenaline rush of fear slowly faded , the scream still rang in her ears . She took some deep breaths . He was probably about her age , mid-thirties , tall and slender . He wore a rough woolen jersey , unraveling slightly at the neck , and an open sheepskin jacket , dark with moisture . A couple of cameras were slung around his neck , a leather gadget bag over one shoulder . A smile flickered tentatively across his face . " Are you all right ? " " I 'm fine . " Given her panicky state a few minutes earlier , the presence of this complete stranger was oddly reassuring . " It 's kind of deserted out there , I do n't see a soul for a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog . One of them disappears and then the other , and suddenly you 're at my window . " She managed a shaky laugh . " Another minute and I 'd have had my can of Mace out . " " Would you now ? " The faint smile appeared again . " But what if I 'd been wanting to help you ? Which I was . " " I 'm naturally suspicious , " she said , distracted momentarily by his eyes . Pale as the fog and fringed with dark lashes , they seemed focused on something beyond her shoulder . In a split second , though , she realized they were actually watching her . It was disconcerting . Like looking through a one-way mirror and finding someone looking back at you . Moments passed . She stared through the open passenger window at him . He gazed into the car at her . " Did you see anyone out there on the edge of the cliffs a few minutes ago ? " she asked , thinking again of the disappearing figures . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here at six ... " His glance took in the mist-shrouded landscape , then he looked at Kate again . " I was beginning to think I 'd been stood up , but maybe it was her you saw . A few minutes ago , you say ? " She glanced at the dashboard clock , then up at him and felt vaguely envious of the girl who 'd stood him up . " About that , I guess . " " Did she have long fair hair ? " he asked . " I do n't even know if it was a girl . I just saw two people . One was smaller , I assumed it was female . She - if it was a she - was n't alone , though . " " Right . " He studied her face for a moment . " Well , I 'll take a look around then . Maybe she 's just late . " Kate eyed the cameras slung around his neck . The breast pocket of his jacket bulged with what she guessed was film and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a green-and-white carton . " You 're shooting a new Waldo book ? Find Waldo in the fog ? " He gave her a blank look . " Waldo ? Little blue-and-red-striped figure ? You have to find him in a page of ... Never mind . I was just curious about what kind of pictures you could take under these conditions . " The thought flashed through her brain that she wanted to prolong this encounter . " It is n't ideal , " he said , " but there are certain settings and film speeds that compensate . " He leaned into the window a little . " Listen , I 'm sorry I frightened you just now . " " You did n't frighten me . " She met his eyes . " You startled me . " " Ah . " " There 's a difference . " " Right , of course . I did n't mean to suggest ... " He shifted his bag to the other shoulder . " Can I do anything ? Your car 's running all right , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " Kate took another look at the clock . It was five minutes to six . " Am I headed the right way for Cragg 's Head ? "
