Just after I of my pickup truck , the two men stalking me had emerged from the shadows and then trailed me though the parking lot . <br> They lagged behind me about fifty feet . I slowed my pace , not that I was n't as slow as a tree slug already , to see if they would overtake me or hang back . <br> They hung back . Not good . <br> Any human at a normal pace should have passed me by now . I could feel their eyes punching holes in me , waiting for the right time to move . <br> Since I was n't up for dealing with any problems , I stepped it out as best I could . With a new-and-improved plastic pelvis and hip , along with tenmonths of physical therapy , I should be able to hobble a little faster . No such luck.The cane and gimpy leg would only go so fast . Grandma Moses on a pogo stick could hop circles <br> around me . <br> Using the rearview mirrors on the cars parked along Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being too obvious , a little trick I picked up when I worked undercover.No need to give them more of an advantage than they already had . <br> The big one , a black kidmaybe twenty years old , wore a white wife-beater muscle shirt and black jean shorts . Mini-dreads jetted from his head like a frayed ball of yarn.The other kid , probably the same age , was an anemic white with a tattoo sprawled on his neck and a shaved head that glistened under the streetlights . <br> With each glance I caught , they feigned like they were talking to each other , but I could sense they were planning to pounce . And why not ? I was an easy mark  --  a crippled guy negotiating the Orlando streets alone at night . One more block to go until I was at work . <br> Eleven months ago I would have enjoyed this game of cat and mouse . But then I would have been the cat , a big hungry one ready to swallow those thugs like the rodents they were . I hoped they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furtive glance behind me , and my tails were nowhere in sight . I stopped and shifted all the way around.Gone.Must have headed up an alley.Maybe I was just losingmy mind.Had n't been out much lately . <br> I used to love the Orlando nightlife , the clubs and things to do ; the pulse of the city at night energized me . It had changed so much in a short amount of time . Faster , meaner , a stranger to me . Like I was living on a different planet . I had grown up here , not long after Mickey scurried in , back when Orlando was more of a cowtown . <br> Now it 's a big city plagued with big-city problems . <br> As I approached the corner of Lake and East Jackson , Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumber raced around the corner right in front of me , both out of breath.They must have sprinted down the alley behind the store to cut me off just before I reached the intersection . <br> This would n't end pretty . <br> " Hey , old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , like felons do when they 're preparing to do something monumentally stupid . <br> His buddy invaded my personal space on my left . " How about some spare change ? " he said with an accent , maybe Haitian . <br> " Do n't have any change . " I eyed possible escape routes , though escape was n't likely in my condition . And I could n't count on anyone to help me , or even to notice , for that matter.On this corner , in a city of over two hundred thousand people , I was on my ownas usual . <br> " Then give up your wallet , or I bust your head like your leg is . " <br> The black kid pressed in on me . <br> " Okay.Okay . " I held upmy right hand while leaning more on the cane with my left . " I 'll give you my wallet . Just do n't hurt me . " <br> " Hurry up ! " The white kid spit as he spoke , clenching his fists at his sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the alpha dog of the two . <br> If they were going to attack , he would lead.He needed to be tamed . <br> I reached back with my right hand , brushed past my wallet in my back pocket , and slipped my hand up into my waistband . I let go of the cane.The brass handle clanked as it bounced off the concrete , echoing around us.Huey and Dewey beaded in on it , drawing their attention down for the second I needed . <br> I unsnapped my Glock 9mm from its holster , then drew it to eye level , settingmy night sights on the white kid 's forehead . A stupefied look crossed his face , which must be a regular event for him . He was n't so alpha dog now . <br> " The leg 's busted , scumbag , but my finger works fine . " I gritted my teeth and leaned forward . " You wan na test it out ? " <br> Both raised their hands . " We 're just playin ' around , man . " The black kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my pistol . <br> " I 'm not . You got ten seconds to run before I call the cops.Ten . Nine . " They were half a block away before I hit five . <br> Retired cops can legally carry guns , even if they 're medically retired . At least I had that going for me . If not , I 'd have been a quick lunch for those creeps . I thought about calling Dispatch and reporting it , but something told me my new friends would think twice for a while before robbing someone again , and I did n't relish the idea of being listed as a victim again on an incident report with my old department . <br> I slid the pistol into its holster at my back , then snapped it in . I combed my fingers through my hair . The May air was thick and still . The adrenaline surge from the game with my buddies was n't all bad . For the first time in a while , I felt alive , energized.Too bad it would die down soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have been a big deal . But everything was a big deal these days . <br> As I stood without support , I felt like I was balancing on a dry , cracked twig ready to snap at any moment , sending me crashing to the concrete.My own legs were under someone else 's spell , because they certainly did n't obey me anymore . I used to be able to roundhouse kick a heavy bag so hard it would bend in half . Now I had to mentally prepare to bend over and pick up my cane so I would n't fall on my face like an idiotor worse , a helpless child . <br> I should n't have been too worried , though . Me and my physical terrorist  --  Imean , therapist  --  Helga , had been working on this . Her name really was n't Helga , but I liked to call her that . A linebacker- sized woman with viselike man hands , sweet Helga and I would rendezvous three times a week  --  whether I wanted to or not . <br> ( If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't get my medical retirement checks . ) I imagine Helga 's former job was as an interrogator in a Russian gulag somewhere deep in Siberia , slapping , twisting , and pounding confessions from the prisoners . <br> I 've cried out for mercy more than once on her medieval torture table . <br> I drew in a deep breath , then exhaled as we practiced . I eased down , shifting all my weight onto my left foot while rolling my right foot on its heel , stretching it out . Throbbing bolts of pain fired up my leg then my spine , like multiple shots from a Taser . I wobbled as my fingers brushed the cane , as if I were petting the head of a snake . My middle finger caught the lip of the hawk-bill handle , then drew it into my hand . I stabbed the tip into the concrete and pressed myself up.What a production . <br> As I righted myself , I took a second to compose , the nerve endings in my lower half signaling their dismay and rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na make my shift as the night watchman at Coral Bay Condominiums , I 'd have to hustle . I 'd hate to lose my new job . But then again , I did n't have much respect for someone who 's never lost anything . <br> My name is Ray Quinn . Eleven months ago , I lost everything . <br> Continues ...
