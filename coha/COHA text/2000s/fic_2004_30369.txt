My name is Vincent , and I 'm an herbaholic . Recovering , that is . And this means , among other things , that I am honor-bound to the principles of sobriety and propriety , both of which are well-established stumbling blocks in the life of a private investigator . I have always believed that the truth shall set you free , but that a good lie , properly told , shall handcuff you to the bedposts , spread whipped cream about your body , and lick your nipples until they 're red and raw , humming with vibrant ecstasy . Not that that 's my bag , mind you . I do n't even have real nipples , and Vincent Rubio has never grooved on dairy . But I can fling out fibs with the best of them , especially if it gets me what I want , when I want it . Or , more precisely , if it does n't get me what I do n't what , when I do n't want it . The problem is that I never know when to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be telling the truth , and I let loose with a burst of honesty just when a shotgun blast of bullshit would be best . That 's why I end up in the messes I end up in . That 's why I regularly fulfill my monthly quota of flops , flubs , and falls . That 's why I remain on a first-name basis with all of my friendly neighborhood bail bondsmen . And it 's probably why I 'm driving down to a South Florida racetrack accompanied by two goons from the infamous Tallarico family , one of the less savory branches of the Cosa Lucertola , familiarly known as the dinosaur mafia . Chaz is a skinny little thing , mop of blond hair up top , and I 'd peg him for a skateboarder or surfer wannabe long before I 'd ever place him in the mob biz . He smells of sweat-the human kind , bitter and acrid , butnot so much that it makes your eyes water . Like a gym locker room after a heavy workout , only without the refreshing whip of soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of those dinos who was never taught either good grooming habits or proper guise care , and , as a result , looks twenty years older than he should . Nearly all of the false hair follicles on his head have long ago relocated to some forgotten corner of the bathtub , and if the light hits his skin just right , I can see that the special latex has become worn across the elbows , daring the green scales beneath to poke through when he flexes the joint . I am well aware that Sherman has already killed at least one person I know ; it would not surprise me to see him try and take out another . Sherman smells like cheese gone bad , jalapeos on the side . This is wholly because his entire diet consists of nachos , pickles , and cola , which have somehow wormed their way into his system and overpowered what should have been a more natural , less curd-intensive scent . These are my new colleagues . That 's what I get for skipping out on a college education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new boss-do n't worry , we 'll get there-to listen to everything Chaz and Sherman tell me . To hang back , do what they say . Do n't get involved unless I 'm instructed to do so . Fine by me-it 's ninety-five degrees , with 80 percent humidity . The last thing I want to do is exert myself . The Lexus we 're riding in has seen better days . The seats are ripped in a number of places , foam poking through a series of parallel slashes . Dark stains splotch the inside roof . Chaz catches my look . " Kinda messy , huh ? These things happen , you know ? " " Of course , " I say . " Messes happen . " " That 's right . Messes happen , that 's what they say . " " Looks like . . . bloodstains , " I say , running my fingers over the dark blotches . They 're dry , at least . Chaz and Sherman shrug at one another as the car shoots across a wide causeway , heading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stem future conversation down this path , he flicks on the radio , and a static-drowned voice fills the air . " - standing on the shores of Haiti " - crackle crackle- " waiting for the winds to strike , but we 've seen no indication that the hurricane will be moving- " Sherman flips the radio off again just as quickly . " That 's all they ever got on , " he grumbles . " Wind this , hurricane that . " We drive in silence for a few more miles as Chaz riffles through a small leather bag by his feet . I ca n't get a good look inside , but I do manage to catch a glimpse of some white plastic . This helps me zero . " Like the boss man said , you just sit back and look intimidating . " " So I 'm muscle . " " Uh-uh , " Sherman corrects me , " you 're pretend muscle . " The climate in South Florida , abhorrent though it may be to those raised to know better , is nevertheless perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've got four well-known and respected tracks located within a thirty-mile drive of each other . Calder Race Course , down in Miami proper , has been given the dubious honor of running the horses during the hottest months of the year . If you want to sweat and lose your bread at the same time , there 's no better place on earth , except for maybe one of those Vietcong Russian roulette matches . The clubhouse itself is a beautiful homage to the days when horse racing was a sport for celebrities and diplomats , when lunching on the green was something other than a dirty late-night-television punch line . I close my eyes for a second as I walk through the wooden portico , and I can almost see the ladies in their white hoop skirts and bonnets , the men in full suits and cravats , the genteel manners and good nature of a day at the races . And then I open them again to find a miasma of flesh and cash , tan and green waving at me from all directions , the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crush . Mammals breathing down my neck , their breath fetid and rotten from the omnipresent beer and potato chips , their bodies thick with sweat and dirt . Their eyes , leering across the ground , harried , anxious , hoping to find a ticket , any ticket , maybe a winner dropped to the concrete in a fit of excitement . The depression when they realize that they 'll never get their money back , and there 's no magic fairy to wave her wand and make it better . Tinkerbell is dead for these folks , and clapping ai n't gon na help . " C'm on , " Sherman says , " let 's go on up . " We walk the stairs into the main grandstand , the peanut shells and beer-slicks underfoot reminding me of Dodger Stadium . I wonder if anyone goes to sporting events these days in order to actually watch the games , or if they 've just become a new venue in which to ingest massive quantities of junk food . Miraculously , they 've come up with new ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beef on a stick . Hot dogs on a stick . Cheese on a stick . Chocolate-coated double-fried sticks on a stick . The mind reels ; the heart attacks . Up here , folks are shoving past one another in the rush to get to the edge of the grandstands where a metal bar keeps the fans from actually falling out onto the racetrack itself in prime soccer-hooligan style . I have no doubt that some of these folks would gladly leap the railing and push their horse on themselves . But there are security guards posted at thirty-foot intervals around the track , and although I see no telltale weapon bulges , I have no doubt they 've got their methods of stopping intruders . " Down here , " Chaz calls , muscling through the crowd , clearing a space for me and Sherm at the bar . " Watch your step . " I wedge myself between Sherman and a man in a wrinkled brown suit , an older fellow who thinks it 's still hip to wear fedoras . Hey , there was a time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I draw the line at the 1950s and leave it at that . He 's clutching a ticket in his hand , the knuckles nearly white as he grips it with a fervor . " Do it do it do it , " he 's muttering , the steady stream of syllables spilling from his lips . " Do it do it do it . . . " " You got a winner there ? " I ask . He jumps back ; I must have startled him . His eyes cross , uncross , and focus , and now he 's got me in his sights . " Lassie Liberty in the fifth . " " Oh , yeah ? " " Lassie Liberty , " he repeats . " The fifth . " I look up at the board on the far side of the grandstand . The results for the fourth race have already been posted , and the fifth is about to start . " This time around , huh ? Maybe I should place a bet- " " My bet ! " he practically yells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lassie Liberty is mine ! " I back off as Sherman pulls me closer , away from the guy in the brown suit . " Best not to aggravate the civilians , " he says . " They get a little jumpy . " " Like a Mexican bean , " I say . " Hope he does n't lose . " " Oh , he 'll lose , " Chaz mutters . " Lassie Liberty 's a nag . " " I du n no , " Sherm counters . " She ran nice last Tuesday . " Obviously , these two have done this before . I wonder if they 've got any other jobs in the organization , or if they 're permanently assigned to the ponies , placing and collecting bets for Eddie Tallarico , cutting the odds when they need to be cut , spreading out the action when the off-site wagers warrant it . Not such a bad job , I guess , if you do n't mind the heat , the humidity , the manure , or the smell of beer , sweat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everyone surging forward at once , pressing into those of us up against the railing . What do they know that I do n't ? I take a look around , wondering if there 's a fight somewhere , usually the most interesting part of any sporting event I 've attended- " There he is , " Sherman says , pointing down at the track . " Lookin ' pretty bad today . " Down below , the horses have been released from the paddock and are slowly being led toward the gates . Eight in all , each one a proud member of its species , walking tall , walking strong , those flowing manes waving in the light breeze , their hooves kicking up the dirt . I am a Thoroughbred , these horses exude . Ride me , whip me , throw roses around my neck , but never forget that I am born to run . And then there 's number 6 . Poor , pitiful number 6 . " Jesus , " the old man next to me coughs . " What the hell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost limping , as if his front two legs have been broken , and then reset by a correspondence-school veterinarian . The hooves themselves are a dirty , mottled brown , cracks visible even at this distance . Those legs that do seem to work are shaky at best , trembling along like seismographs in earthquake country . Patchy fur covers the smallish beast , clumps of hair clinging to the skin with desperation , strands dropping off to the track below with every passing moment . The torso , at least , looks strong , firm and tight , but there 's a hint of a swayback forming in the middle , as if he 'd been ridden too hard and too long by someone much too heavy for the task . He lopes along in a depressed , addled stagger . Think Eeyore on sedatives . But it 's the head-held low , staring down at his wrecked hooves-and the shamed cast to the eyes that tell the whole story . This horse knows he is finished . Do n't ask me how , but the creature understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the glue factory . A ridiculous notion , of course . Everyone knows that Compies make the best glue . " Here , " Sherm chuckles , " hold on to these . " He hands me a sheaf of wager tickets , the wad thick in my hand . I look down to see which horse Tallarico has placed his hard-earned money on , and a giant number 6 looks back up at me . " That 's him ? " I say incredulously . " That 's our horse ? " " That 's the one , " Sherman affirms . " Love My Money . " " Hold on , hold on . " This ca n't be right . " We 're betting on number six ? The one with the-the one that 's barely a horse ? " Chaz laughs . " You do n't know the half of it . " " Look , " Sherm says , drawing me closer , dropping the volume . " Do n't make bones , okay ? You 'll understand it after . For now , hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shrug and check the big board . Love My Money is running at 35-to-1 , which , should the completely impossible happen and he actually win the race , would pay off these tickets to the tune of somewhere over fifty thousand dollars . Of course , were that to occur , I would immediately duck and cover for fear that I 'd be crapped on by all the pigs flying through the air . The undersized jockeys-predominantly Compies , I am sure , though the great Willie Shoemaker is supposedly an undersized Coelophysis , which would explain the predilection for jodhpurs-ride their horses up to the gate and lead them in . The number 4 horse is particularly antsy , refusing to go anywhere near the metal cages . " See that ? " the guy in the brown suit belts out . " See that ? Lassie Liberty . She 's a feisty one ! Do it do it do it ! Feisty girl ! " Lassie Liberty is indeed feisty , enough so to take a sizable dump just before her handlers are able to squeeze her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winning . At the very least , she 'll be pushing along a lighter load . As for Love My Money-well , he just glides right into the gate as if it 's the most natural and depressing thing in the world . Somewhere in that little suicidal horse brain of his , I 'm guessing , he hopes it 's the entrance to a slaughterhouse . " We 're all in place ? " Sherman asks Chaz . " So far 's I know . " I do n't have time to ask them exactly what they 're talking about , because a hushed silence falls over the crowd , a giant hiccough of sound as we all anticipate the break . The track announcer holds it for another second , teasing us , drawing out our excitement , our anxiety-The buzzer sounds , the gates clang open , and they 're off . The number 2 horse is the first out , running hard , fast , her legs tearing up the course , her flanks rippling in great waves of muscle movement . But number 5 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third . And-surprise , surprise-Love My Money is dead last , eating dirt , his pitiful legs clawing at the track surface , already five full lengths behind the leaders with barely an eighth of the course run . " Nice choice , " I mutter to Sherman . " Remind me to bet against you guys next time you run a Super Bowl office pool . " " Shut up and watch . "
