The night of the masquerade was a kind of mad , risque waltz , the voices louder and the laughter giddier than anyone would have expected . That was the nature of masks . Michael Dansky leaned against the wall with a Guinness in his hand and studied the ebb and flow of the bright costumes and the body language beneath them . There was something about a masquerade that changed people . Inhibitions slipped away , and not only because of the alcohol present . The question , Michael thought , was whether putting on a mask allowed the wearer to lose themselves in the pretense that they were someone else , or if hiding their faces let them show more of who they really were , down inside . The Wayside Inn was a charming spot where one could imagine the nineteenth century had never ended . From across the ballroom , Michael watched his wife Jillian move through the masquerade in her Elizabethan gown , smiling beneath an elegant half-mask . Michael had never thought of her as anything less than sexy , but tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the way she moved across the floor , a sensuality in her eyes behind that mask , that took his breath away . As she passed through the room another woman caught her arm and the two struck up a conversation of smiles and moving lips , words lost amidst the churning voices of the masquerade . Jillian 's hair was a rich chestnut brown , and her hazel eyes seemed alight with mischief . The woman she spoke to was a thin blonde dressed as a genie . Michael pushed away from the wall and started across the ballroom toward them . He was vaguely aware that the bottle of Guinness in his hand undermined the effectiveness of his owncostume : the cape , boots , hat , and blade of the dashing D'Artagnan of Three Musketeers fame . Yet there was a swagger in his walk that might have sprung from either the ale or the costume , or more likely both . The ballroom was accented by a pair of grand staircases that curled up either side of the room to a second-story balcony that looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing so garish as what he had seen at weddings held in hotel ballrooms . The masquerade was an annual event held in support of the Merrimack Valley Children 's Hospital , and in the three years since their marriage he and Jillian had never missed it . It was Saturday night , three days before Halloween , and though the holiday had become overrun with more modern costumes , the organizers of the event insisted that no one wear a disguise inspired by something post-1900 . The music in the room was under the same restriction . Some people Michael had spoken to were bothered by the lack of familiar dance music , but others made the best of it , attempting minuets and waltzes , and even a quadrille , which Miri Gallaway and Victoria Peristere taught the attendees every year . Michael loved it all . The music and the period costumes harkened back to a simpler time , an era in which people believed in mystery . He worked as an art director for Krakow &; Bester , an advertising firm out of Andover , and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and images , it also exposed him to far too many people whose minds were an arid desert of imagination . This was sheer joy . As he crossed the room toward his wife , he bowed in courtly fashion to a beautiful lady pirate and one of Dracula 's brides . In the midst of her conversation with the blond genie , Jillian caught sight of him and a playful smile touched the corners of her mouth . She gave him a tiny wave . Abruptly , his view of Jillian was blocked by several couples dancing to a jaunty tune . He tried to find another path toward her and nearly ran into a portly Henry VIII and a blood-smeared Anne Boleyn . Michael laughed hard enough that he nearly spilled his Guinness . " What 's so bloody funny , peasant ? " demanded King Henry . " That beard , for starters , " Michael replied . The king sniffed at this insult , but touched at his glued-on beard with concern . His real name was Teddy Polito , and his lovely corpse bride was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bester , a semineurotic whose face seemed etched in a perpetual grimace that was deceiving . Despite his various ticks and peeves , the burly forty-something had a kind heart . " It took me an hour to get this damn thing on right , " Teddy muttered . Michael tried to conceal his smile , but failed . " That 's . . . that 's pretty astonishing . " Colleen arched an eyebrow and shot an appraising glance at her husband . " I 'd say . You 'd expect it to be much more time-consuming to really get that perfect Elmer 's glue look . " Teddy put a hand across his heart . " You wound me . " His wife bumped him with a curvy hip . " Big baby . " She was a brunette with auburn highlights in her hair , a woman with a face that would have been ordinary if not for her large , green eyes . " Very true , Colleen . I do n't know why we put up with him . " " I 'm an enigma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your charm , " Michael said . He glanced around . " Now where has my beautiful wife got off to ? " Jillian was still with her blond genie friend , halfway up the right-side staircase with a drink in her hand . Even as Michael caught sight of her , Jillian began to laugh . Her face flushed and she raised the back of her hand to cover her mouth -- a habit left over from the braces of her youth -- and took a step away from the genie . His heart stopped as her foot missed the stair . From the ballroom floor , in the midst of those dancers and with the sound of lute and fiddle and pennywhistle in his ears , he held his breath and watched her begin to fall . Jillian let go of her drink and her glass tumbled out over the edge of the banister , falling to shatter on the floor below . She caught herself with that empty hand , the other still covering her mouth , her eyes wide with fear . And then an awful sort of embarrassed amusement lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , attempting to pretend the incident had never happened . She kept her hand to her mouth , and Michael knew she was hiding a smile . The genie was laughing in relief and disbelief . She took Jillian by the arm and led her further up the stairs . Only then did Michael exhale . " Somebody might be having too good a time , " Colleen said , but there was no accusation in it . Jillian was n't much of a drinker , and became tipsy if she had more than one glass of wine . The Politos knew that . " I 'm going to see if she 's all right , " Michael told them . " You do that , " Teddy said . " In fact , we 'll come say hello . " " Not to worry , " Michael replied , eyes still tracking Jillian , whom he could see talking to Ned Bergh , a local realtor , and his wife , Sue . Jillian was talking rapidly with her hands , her whole face animated as she told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're not ready to turn into pumpkins yet . " Michael turned with a flourish of his cape and the three of them set off toward the stairs . He threw himself into the character of D'Artagnan , one hand on the pommel of his sword , channeling the arrogance of a musketeer . D'Artagnan led King Henry and the resurrected Anne Boleyn up the stairs . Several people called to Teddy and he waved . Once he paused to lean over and mutter something into the ear of a man Michael vaguely recognized as a local politician . The man responded with a knowing laugh , full of insinuation . Teddy had a flair for dirty jokes . Colleen had n't heard whatever her husband had said , but she gave him a jab to the shoulder on basic principle . Michael also saw people he knew , though with the costumes and masks it was difficult , sometimes , to tell who they were at first . Gary Bester , son of one of his firm 's founders , waved to him from the opposite staircase , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dressed as the Big Bad Wolf and his girlfriend , Brittany , as Red Riding Hood . The girl was nineteen , the agency 's receptionist , and the sort that even the most decent-hearted man had trouble keeping his eyes off of . Gary was annoying as hell , a talker without any stories to tell , and insanely jealous of any guy Brittany gave the time of day . It was best to just steer clear of both of them . From the top of the stairs , the view of the masquerade was extraordinary . The colors in motion , the sounds of fiddle and mandolin , accordion and harpsichord , and the antique decor of the ballroom , all combined to take his breath away . Teddy and Colleen were pulled away by a fiftyish woman Michael did not recognize , and so he paused a moment at the balustrade to soak it all in . His reverie was broken by the sound of his wife 's laughter , and he turned to see her still talking to the Berghs . They had been joined now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bulbous nose and curly graying hair , and a thin Irishman with wispy white hair . Michael did not know the first man , who wore the sombrero and clothing of a Mexican peasant , but the older fellow was Bob Ryan , a city councillor . Ryan was clad in faded denim , weathered boots , a long jacket , and a hat that shaded his startlingly blue eyes . At his waist , Michael could see leather gun belts that crisscrossed one another . If there was anyone at the masquerade who looked more authentic in his costume , Michael had n't seen him . " Lawyers are just the mouthpieces , " Jillian announced as Michael joined the circle that had gathered around her . They laughed with her and she favored them with a sardonic grin . " It 's just like modern medicine . Nurses do all the work . Doctors get the glory . In a law firm , paralegals do everything , and lawyers just show up for the face time and to sign the paperwork . " The Mexican peasant narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't see many paralegals arguing cases in front of a judge . " Jillian waved him away . " Please , Benny . That 's the showbiz . I 'm talking about the work . Sure , we 're not doing the song and dance , but we choreographed it , honey . We wrote the music and the lyrics . Anyway , that 's not my area . I do corporate law . There are just as many criminals , but they 're behind desks instead of bars . " Even as she said this last , she noticed Michael and her eyes lit up . " Well , hello , my handsome musketeer . " With a flourish , Michael bowed . " Mademoiselle . " " Ah , D'Artagnan , " Bob Ryan said , tipping his hat , " Seor Bartolini and I were just trying to convince your lovely wife what a wonderful candidate she 'd make for city council next fall . " Michael raised an eyebrow and glanced at Jillian . There was a sparkle in her eye that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law school , but after becoming a paralegal and witnessing firsthand the long hours and the stress required of first-year attorneys trying to make it on staff , she had realized she simply was n't masochistic enough to be a lawyer . Still , she enjoyed learning about the process and she embraced her work at the firm . Paralegal work was a compromise , but it was one she could live with . Jillian had climbed , in a very short period , to the top of the Boston legal scene . She commuted into the city every day , came home late almost every night . She was the paralegal manager at Dawes , Gray &; Winter , the largest and most powerful firm in Boston . And though she did not discuss it often , Michael knew she coveted the top spot , the position of paralegal director . That sparkle in her eye was her quiet ambition . " So you 're a politician now , huh ? " " Nope , " she said . " But I am a woman of the people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . As she came toward him , disrupting the circle of people who had been involved in that conversation , there was a sway in her walk that he knew sprang from alcohol , rather than any sultry intention . If she had been a drinker by nature , it would have alarmed him . But instead there was something sweet , even innocent , about her inebriation . Jillian wrapped her arms around him and kissed his temple softly , then languidly unfurled herself from him and stood at his side , facing the others . " Well , sweetheart , " Michael said , gazing at his wife . " You 've got my vote . " At midnight the masquerade was still in full swing . Michael and Jillian had danced for hours , spinning around the ballroom together . The Politos had joined them , but the Danskys were younger and in better shape , and soon enough Teddy and Colleen had taken a breather and spent much of the balance of the night with other friends . The dancing took its toll . Michael 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead , his chest , and the back of his neck . Yet with his wife in his arms it seemed to him that they were both like marionettes , that whatever magic had transported them back in time filled them with a childlike glee that made it impossible not to dance . They did manage to rest from time to time , at least long enough to socialize , and to whisper silly things in each other 's ears . They were both burning off some alcohol with their dancing , so Michael did n't worry much about the additional drinks that friends bought them . It would have been rude to decline . But , eventually , the alcohol caught up to Jillian . " Time to go home , " Michael whispered in her ear . Her face scrunched up . " Honey . It 's still early . Nobody 's leaving yet . " She 'd had to stop dancing to say this , and when she did she swayed against him . A frown creased her forehead and she glanced down at her feet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised her eyes once more . " On the other hand . . . " Jillian slipped her arm through Michael 's and they began to work their way toward the door , bidding good night and happy Halloween to friends and acquaintances . Her eyes were glazed and , now that she had stopped dancing , Michael could almost see the alcohol affecting her . When she said " see you " to Ned Bergh , Jillian slurred the words . It was a first since he had known her , and Michael resolved never to mention it to her . He knew she would be mortified . At the base of one of the staircases he saw gunslinger Bob Ryan again , but he averted his gaze and steered Jillian more quickly toward the door . Ryan might not urge Jillian to run for city council if he thought she was a drinker .
