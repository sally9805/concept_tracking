One night , though , the 39-year-old singer found himself being trailed to the parking lot by an awestruck teen . " Are you Richard Marx ? " she asked . He was delighted-until she added , " My mom just loves you ! " Says Marx : " I thought , It 's come to that .

Playing foosball with Brandon , 12 , Lucas , 10 , and Jesse , 8-his sons with wife Cynthia Rhodes , a retired actress ( Dirty Dancing ) - Marx could pass for any suburban father .

He sang his first jingle at 5 and began writing his own tunes at 15 . When Lionel Richie heard his demo , he suggested the teen move to L.A. After graduating from high school in 1981 , Marx did just that , working as a backup singer , songwriter and gofer until he landed a contract to record his 1987 album , a multiplatinum smash . By that time his personal life was on track too . He had met Rhodes in ' ' 83 while working on a duet for the film Staying Alive , in which she costarred with John Travolta .
