HARRY 'S LONDON FRIENDS  --  toy manufacturers , dealers , importers  --  had insisted on complimenting him for a shrewdness he knew he did n't have , for holding out until the offer for his modest business had climbed to an immodest seven million dollars . Harry tried to explain that there had been no policy in his saying no , that five million dollars was as unbelievable and excessive as seven , but that he had genuinely been unsure about selling , had finally agreed more for Helen and the children 's sake than because his mind was clear . <p> Harry could see that this was not the explanation his friends wanted . He was a dream of their own come true , and dreams are not supposed to doubt themselves . Harry was reluctant , then , to tell them that he had settled on this European tour not only for the pleasure of seeing friends and allowing Helen the long trip she had desired for years but also because it was one of the few things he could think of that would help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money like a new set of clothes , wondering how it would fit , how he would look in it when the world turned its eyes on him . <p> The trip , the " triumphal tour , " Helen called it , had already provided unexpected revelations to each of them about the other . Helen , for instance , who had to struggle to remember the names of all Harry 's friends in New York , new names constantly being added while old ones never vanished , had still been surprised , even overwhelmed , by the circle of warm attention , of hospitality , that sprang up around them from the moment they landed . Harry had dozens of acquaintances  --  English and expatriate American  --  all in the toy business and all full of joking admiration for the hard and successful bargain he had driven in selling out . He was introduced more than once  --  with affectionate mockery and genuine respect  --  as an exemplar of the American Dream , as the embodiment of the self-made millionaire , of what it was still possible to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in London that Harry had friends , not only in London stores  --  even , to Helen 's amazement and unspoken and perhaps inwardly unacknowledged awe , on the shelves at Harrod 's  --  that the products of his imagination were on display . Helen , who had been utterly unprepared for the gigantic offer , had been equally unprepared for the evidence of why that offer had been made , for the sight of Harry 's brightly painted wooden trellises and railroad cars , his rudimentary city streets and inauthentic countryside , a brown cylinder topped by a green triangle making a tree , following them from city to city and town to town across northern Europe . For all her admiration , she did not understand how these rather simple-minded and non-electronic toys could thrive in the Age of Nintendo . <p> Harry himself could not explain their appeal . " Children need to get hold of the world with their hands , " was all he could say , and he would open and close his fists in the air and then reach out and touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration of what hands were for . <p> Harry was his own best salesman , had been going to toy fairs and on selling trips in Europe for over twenty years , never fewer than two or three times a year , so that the tourist sights that were Helen 's first interest were old hat to him  --  or so he could claim , could beg off on grounds of overexposure and surrender Helen to his friends ' wives to do the honors while the men talked toys . But then , over dinner , listening to her describe her reactions , Harry would be struck by how much of Helen 's pleasure came from prior knowledge , from the satisfaction of a curiosity she had taken the time and trouble to cultivate . Actually , neither he nor Helen should have been surprised , because they had planned the trip that way : Harry 's friends and Helen 's museums and churches . Northern Europe this trip , Italy and Greece the next . <p> There was a single great exception , which mutual agreement had moved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lengthened or shortened without jeopardizing the rest of the trip , or so that  --  at the extreme of incompatibility , which they both doubted would occur  --  Harry could fly home and leave Helen behind to prowl the Louvre to her heart 's content . Harry did not know a soul in Paris . France , he had discovered long ago , was  --  except for the area around Marseille , in the south  --  not much of a market for children 's toys . <p> " Kids ' clothing , " he had been told , " is what the French buy , because that reflects back on the family . Because that 's worn outside the home , where people can see it . But toys ... The truth is the French do n't believe that childhood is a time to amuse oneself . French children go to school until five-thirty at night , and then they have chores and lessons . It 's all backwards . The older a Frenchman gets , the more of his time is devoted to amusing himself . " <p> Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . He knew that even if she were just as happy to do her serious and artistic sightseeing by herself , she would want to talk to him about it afterward , to explain what she had seen and her responses to it , the way she had been doing already with his friends . And there were the famous stores and restaurants , the popular monuments like the Eiffel Tower and the Arch of Triumph , the nightlife , all of which they could share . Harry was all too aware of how narrow his own interests were , of how thirty-seven years in the toy trade had shaped the way he looked at the world . <p> He had made small trials of himself as they went along , brief excursions more or less at Helen 's side that had served only to confirm his limits . At Windsor Castle , Harry had fallen in love with a doll 's house , some man 's life 's work that he had presented to the queen  --  Victoria , Harry thought it was . In Edinburgh , on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest in the Toy Museum , had passed over the Scottish National Gallery to visit the shops along Prince 's Street . Everywhere they went , in fact , Harry had been most comfortable doing his touring in the streets , looking into display windows or at people 's faces , or going into stores just to see what they had on the shelves , how it was different from what he was used to seeing on shelves elsewhere . <p> In Vienna , their last stop before Paris , Harry had made a more sustained effort , had gone with Helen to the Historical Arts museum two or three times , put on evening clothes to attend the opera and the symphony , spent an hour walking around and through the restored cathedral , visited marble palaces high above the Danube , but what stayed with him  --  literally stayed , because he had shipped a full set on ahead to their hotel in Paris  --  was an extraordinary sequence of constructions in silvered or metallically glistening plastic or machine-tooled epoxy that he had been hypnotized by in a shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shown the progression of kits  --  parts so tiny and complex , instructions so elaborate , so thick a sheaf of illustrations , that it was as if a secret race , extraterrestrials or extragalacticians , had stumbled onto an erector set out of the 1940s and redesigned it to teach their children about space , to make platforms and satellites and rocket ships to take them back home to the stars . <p> The owner spoke perfect English , told Harry the kits had been designed and developed in Germany and that he was the exclusive distributor not only for Vienna but for all of eastern and southern Europe , and that he did n't think the kits were available in America yet because the general feeling was that children there would not be patient or disciplined enough to learn how to use them . The terms on which Harry had sold his business barred him from designing or distributing for the same market he had served before . He was free , though  --  if he could figure out why he wanted to , what there was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do whatever he wanted with toys for older children or adults . <p> Uncharacteristically , Harry did not tell Helen about the kits . He suspected they were just a diversion to keep him busy in Paris while Helen did her sightseeing , and he was a little embarrassed that a grown man , lacking any financial incentive , might need to send toys ahead for himself to play with in what Helen told him was the most beautiful city in the world , the " City of Light . " <p> Harry did n't know whether it was Helen 's influence or Hollywood 's  --  the memory of Gene Kelly dancing or roller-skating in front of all those picture-postcard views  --  or the envy expressed by his friends everywhere else at the idea of an unlimited stay in Paris with what amounted to unlimited funds , but from the moment they turned off the autoroute and Helen , Michelin map open in her lap , guided them through the wide and narrow streets to the Seine and then along the Left Bank , calling out landmarks as they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , an anticipation that might have been the lights dimming before a movie or musical comedy , as if he expected an overture to sound out over the river or credits to float in the air between himself and the twin towers of Notre-Dame . <p> To his great relief , he did not have to pretend to Helen to be enjoying himself ; his first impression held good . He had never seen streets arranged with such charm , window or counter displays that so enchanted the eyes and teased at the pocketbook ; never known service in cafes or restaurants to be so gracious ; and even Vienna had not prepared him for the food and wine , so that all his senses seemed to be in a perpetual state of alertness and gratification . He did not understand what Helen saw in her paintings , disliked them for their two-dimensionality , for reminding him of the video games that reduced all reality to electronic blips on a screen , but Harry could stand for minutes admiring the arrangement of fruit and vegetables in an outdoor stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish shimmering under aspic , in the windows of an appetizing store . <p> Sometimes , when he ducked into a cafe for a quick beer or mineral water , he would carry the glass to one of the omnipresent American-made and - labeled pinball machines and play a game or two , enjoying the impact of the ball against the flippers , the idea that he was applying physical laws he could understand . He was not ashamed to buy by pointing , always had ready a bill or coin of the needed denomination , always pocketed the change without counting it . <p> In a way , their lives in Paris were more exciting because he and Helen were doing different things and talking about them afterward ; it was almost a New York life , shared as much in words as in practice . In Vienna , where they spent almost all their time together , their meals had been relatively silent ; now suddenly they were interrupting each other , forgetting to eat , gesturing with wineglasses instead of drinking from them . <p> From time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though he were trying to take them or himself by surprise , Harry would slip into one of the famous and holy places Helen had talked about over dinner . He went inside Notre-Dame to look at the windows , to Cluny to look at the tapestries , to the Louvre two or even three times , when he knew Helen had other plans ( he followed tourist groups because he reasoned they would lead him to the major sights ) . Occasionally he ducked into churches or even small museums whose names he had never heard of , and waited for something to connect , for the magic that Helen seemed to see in these places to touch his own life . <p> Harry 's explorations , gradually extending from the chic Right Bank neighborhood where their hotel was , began to take him into what seemed like older or less spruced-up parts of town , through cheap entertainment districts or past stores that reminded him more of Fourteenth Street than of Madison Avenue ; and when he had learned to use the Metro rather than just consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable asking a taxi to drive him at random , would not have known how to phrase the request even in English  --  Harry extended his range still farther , to ramshackle and colorful streets where he saw many casually dressed Frenchmen or North Africans , but rarely another obvious tourist . <p> He smiled back at the curiosity he saw he provoked : quietly dressed and without camera or guidebook , but six-foot-four nonetheless and like a tower walking down the narrow streets . Harry was amazed and a little disappointed at the good manners of the children , who stared or nudged but never dared speak to him or approach him directly . <p> During this time , as gradually and suddenly as the huge chestnut leaves began to fall , a second Paris was coming into being around Harry , a Paris transparent as the white of an egg , in which the other Paris , the one he saw and walked through , was held in suspension . Harry learned a few words  --  " please , " " thank you , " " excuse me " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did the foreign money . For the most part , though , he was content to negotiate his life in English . In restaurants or cards that did n't have an English menu , and even in some that did , Harry learned to point inconspicuously at what another diner was having and say " S'il vous plait " to the waiter , or " La meme chose . " But the words were merely mechanical , an adjunct of questionable necessity to the pointed finger , the smile and the nod . <p> Early one afternoon , in a neighborhood near the Bastille , Harry had been attracted by a storybook restaurant , charmingly dilapidated and casual , in a low , whitewashed corner building topped with clusters of smoking chimney pots , by the glimpse he caught through deep-set latticed windows of a large and crowded room , long tables studded with oversized bottles of wine . He could see the bustling waitresses , the animated faces of the diners , who might be shopkeepers or office girls or mechanics , the drivers of taxis or of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the street . Whenever the restaurant door opened , a roar of voices and laughter , a clattering of dishes , filled the air . <p> Harry , who had till now , on his expeditions to what Helen told him were called the " popular quarters , " confined himself to sandwiches or omelettes in uncrowded cafes or waited to eat until he was back in a more elegant part of town , realized that he was hungry , not only in the gross sense of having walked a long way since a very light breakfast and having a growling stomach to remind him , but hungry , too , for the clustering of humanity , for all that ferociously cheerful hubbub raging across the way . <p> Carrying his bulk as lightly as he could , trying to shrink it down or fold it in , Harry crossed the street , opened the door , and smiled at the immediate and mercifully brief abatement of noise , near-suspension of motion , that greeted him as he ducked under the lintel and took a step or two blindly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food smells swimming through the hot , fragrant air . He saw no place , at first , to sit , wondered if he had stumbled into a marriage or birthday party , if all the people at the long tables  --  like in one of the medieval feasts by Breughel he had seen in Vienna  --  were friends and family of each other . <p> One of the waitresses , heavy , not young , smiling through the beads of sweat on her upper lip , her entire face glowing and red , steaming plates in one hand , cutlery and a paper tablecloth in the other , said a few words he did n't understand and , seeing he did n't , pointed with her chin toward the middle of one of the tables , a chair pulled back from an uncleared place . Harry maneuvered down the most crowded aisle to the empty spot , fitted himself in , remembering PTA meetings in classrooms years ago , his knees at his chest as he squeezed behind a tiny desk , wondering whether he was supposed to raise his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diners , although they had certainly noted his entrance or clumsy progress down the aisle , were like the children in the streets in avoiding direct contact . Their heads were bent over their plates , both hands working hard , and their talk  --  short bursts between mouthfuls , longer phrases after a sip of wine , which they were drinking from what seemed like water glasses , sharing the huge bottles placed between each group of four or six diners and replenished at need  --  passed Harry in all directions without seeming to touch him ; they scarcely looked at each other , he noted , spoke down at their plates or into their glasses , bounced the sounds toward each other off neutral surfaces , or were perhaps just bouncing the sounds around Harry so as not to seem rude . <p> The waitress leaned across from behind , her large breast surprising Harry 's shoulder so that he jerked forward , tried to make himself even smaller , as she lifted away the dirty dishes , folded the wine- and gravy-stained paper tablecloth in from the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple-carboned menu in front of him on the abruptly naked square of nailed-down oilcloth . <p> Harry lifted the menu in a kind of reflex as the waitress leaned back over him to unfold a fresh square of paper , add knife , fork , and water glass , and slide an oblong basket overflowing with chunks of sliced bread within Harry 's reach . He could feel the silence of anticipation gathering at his shoulder , spreading to the nearest of the diners . " I 'll try that , " Harry said quite loudly , forgetting the words he had learned in French , and tilting his head , rudely enough , at the steaming plate of stew his right-hand neighbor had almost finished . <p> The waitress said something Harry could not understand . He tried to look back , could n't , shrugged and shook his head . Harry 's right-hand neighbor came to the rescue , turned and shot a flurry of words at the waitress : " ... laitree " was all of it Harry thought he caught . The man smiled and clapped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water glass and filled it with red wine . Harry took a sip , a bite of bread , nodding his thanks . The man went back to eating , but when the waitress returned moments later with Harry 's stew and started to lift the menu away to make room , the man intercepted her gesture , took the menu himself and held it for Harry to see , pointed at a purple scrawl toward the center of the page . Tripes lyonnaise , Harry made out next to the man 's fingernail . <p> " Treep leeonez , " the man said aloud , and pointed at the plate . <p> Harry looked down , puzzled , and then all at once the words on paper , the sounds , the sight and spicy smell of the plate steaming under his nose fused in a single thought and with a joy of discovery so unexpected and intense that Harry laughed aloud . He grabbed the man 's hand and said , " Merci , merci , " nodding and smiling to show he understood . <p> " Suhsohn laytreep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harry nodded and attacked them with his fork . " They are tripe  --  tripes , " he said aloud , " treeps , " and he could n't tell whether it was the taste of the tripe or of the language he suddenly felt burning in his mouth . He swallowed a full glass of wine , had the impression , feeling the rush of blood to his face ( though he was the one too shy to look up now ) , that all the table was smiling at him . <p> For a while , it was like being drunk . There was no end to the names on French menus , no end to the names of streets in Paris . And there was a joy , which Harry could n't explain to himself , in learning the language the way a child would , without intermediaries , just the shock of contact with reality and the word dropping loose at the moment of collision . A clerk at Galignani , the big English-language bookstore on the Rue de Rivoli , was most helpful . Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sturdy shoulder-strap , in order to house what he called his traveling library . There was the squat , blue-bound Cassell 's English-French , French-English dictionary ; the wine-colored , pocket-sized Plan de Paris par arrondissements ; and finally , the white cover and bright-red lettering of the Gault Millau Guide de Paris , the restaurant and shopping guide that the book clerk said many Parisians used themselves , which listed nightclubs and cafes and other information that Harry would be sure to find useful . <p> Helen was impressed by both the physical weight and the intellectual effort represented by Harry 's library , which  --  constantly consulted  --  made a heap on the table or the floor or a spare chair in every restaurant or cafe they went to , caused momentary embarrassment in the stately restaurants de luxe that Harry would lead them to from time to time . The waiters and maitres d'hotel were enormously tolerant of Harry , though , seemed to relish trading their good English for his bad French , and would even correct his pronunciation without seeming to , by announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon  --  the name of each dish as they presented it , mixing the name in slowly and carefully , like a vital last ingredient . <p> PETRISSANS 17e-30 bis Av . Niel On eprouve certains scrupules a inscrire au chapitre ' bistrot ' ce haut lieu de degustation d'un marchand de vin prestigieux . Mais Tristan Bernard , qui s'inspire du decor ancien et des habitudes des clients et des employes de ce debit de boissons singulier dans la piece qu'il titre ' Le Petit Cafe , ' nous a ouvert la voie . De vieux et savants amateurs viennent ici comparer en claquant la langue des vins rarissimes qui portent allegrement le meme age qu'eux et des champagnes partout ailleurs introuvables . <p> Harry had been walking in Parc Monceau , admiring the beautifully tended trees and autumnal flowers , the black swans on the tiny lake , the miniature waterfall and the collection of what Helen had informed him were fake ruins , built only a couple of hundred years ago to decorate what was then a private park , when he began to feel tired and thirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Vins , " and found the entry for Petrissans in the 17th Arrondissement . <p> Harry did not bother to consult his Plan de Paris ; the name of the street had rung a bell or pushed a button  --  like on one of the electric maps in a Metro station  --  and Harry could see his route marked out for him as though in tiny colored lights through the labyrinth of streets beyond the mock Roman temple at the entrance of the park . He walked briskly , confidently , pausing only  --  a new habit  --  to decode the small white cards advertising apartments for rent or sale in the district whenever he passed the windows of an agent immobilier . He had never gone inside one of the offices , never even mentioned the possibility to Helen , but he could n't help thinking how much fun it might be to furnish an apartment for themselves in one of these imposing old buildings , of how many new words would burst into life in the process of buying everything they needed to live . <p> Harry suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of colored lights to follow . He must be there . But where was he ? He had come out onto a lovely square with a church on one corner , tree-lined streets leading away in all directions . The only cafe in sight was a tiny tabac , two tables under an awning , on one corner . This was certainly not Avenue Niel . Harry crossed to the tabac , but before he could make out the faded lettering on the awning , read " Place Tristan Bernard " on the blue-and-white street sign clamped to the facade . Tristan Bernard ? <p> When he finally figured out what had happened , by which time he had finished two beers at one of the tables under the awning , Harry felt in awe of what his mind had done : leading him past Avenue Niel to a square he had no memory of ever having visited in order to match a name he had no memory of having registered when he scanned the entry for Petrissans . The whole experience was pregnant with meaning . Harry had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like his children , for that matter  --  had been unplanned . <p> It took a third beer and the better part of an hour of hunting words through the Gassell , of venturing timidly and for the first time into the grammar sections , to translate that Tristan Bernard had written a play called Le Petit Cad based on the ancient decor and amusing habits of the customers of what was now Petrissans , which was itself notable for its rare wines and the champagnes that could not be found anywhere else . <p> " But what am I supposed to do about it ? " Harry asked himself . There was only one possibility . He consulted his dictionary , his Gault Millau , then whistled down a cab . Half an hour later , when he emerged from a Librairie de Spectacle , a theater bookstore , Harry was carrying , as gingerly as any savage , his first Bible , a large , slightly used book with a glossy white cover , the reduced price in crayon across the upper right corner : " TRISTAN BERNARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not read French . When he opened the book to Le Petit Card , fog boiled up off the pages . When he looked up words it was like shining flashlights in the fog . He needed to see more clearly . Harry realized that much had undoubtedly changed since 1911 , that dress and habits , styles of speech , would have evolved . But Paris was a European city , a city of strong traditions , a city that respected and honored its past . Much of 1911 would have survived , if Harry only knew how to look . <p> " There is this cafe called  --  well , it does n't have a name . It 's located where Petrissans is now , and most of its customers work in the department stores at that big intersection on Ternes where Magasins Reunis is located . They come for lunch and play all kinds of card games and board games , and then a bell rings three minutes before they have to be back at work , and it 's agreed that all the games end right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the losers can stall until the bell rings and then they wo n't have lost anything . <p> " The hero is a waiter named Albert Loriflan who used to live in a chateau and was brought up with the lord 's own children and given a good education , and then the lord went to see the world before he died  --  even though he was sick already  --  and I guess he died before he saw the world , or all of it , because he never came back , and Albert had to leave the chateau and come to Paris and become a waiter . <p> " Well , Albert has an old girlfriend whom he knew as a young girl , except I think that might mean virgin , and so he thinks he ca n't leave her because he feels responsible even though she 's a lot older than he is and sings with a group of her sisters  --  sometimes they 're Hungarians and sometimes they 're gypsies  --  in nightclubs all over the city . She can only see Albert every two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes him to start missing her , but she 's very jealous and takes out a gun and threatens to shoot him if he has anything to do with another woman . <p> " The thing is the old lord must have died after all , because this shady character comes in and tells the proprietor , who 's a widower with a daughter who works in the cafe sometimes but is very stuck-up and takes piano and English lessons and I think Albert likes a lot but says he does n't  --  maybe because he 's afraid of his girlfriend or maybe because he thinks the daughter is too good for him  --  that Albert is going to inherit a lot of money  --  eight hundred thousand francs , however much that is  --  and gets the proprietor , who does n't seem like too bad a guy , only stupid and greedy , to get Albert to sign a twenty-year contract as a waiter at a very high salary , but with a penalty of two hundred thousand francs if either side breaks the contract before the twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if he wants to put up with twenty more years of being insulted by the proprietor 's daughter , but since he 's just gotten drunk down in the basement , drinking wine directly from the fresh barrels before the proprietor has had time to water them , he signs the contract without too much trouble . But then the postman comes , and Albert gets the letter telling him he 's gotten the inheritance , and he buys drinks for everybody and tries to quit , tells the proprietor to forget the fifty-two francs back salary he owes him , to use it to buy a gift for his daughter , but the proprietor says no , he 'll just subtract the fifty-two francs from the two hundred thousand Albert owes him for quitting . <p> " Albert decides that the way out is to be such a rotten waiter that the boss has to fire him . So he pours coffee into brandy glasses and serves brandy in coffee cups , tells the customers that the cognac is made from wood alcohol and the coffee is made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go out to bring back their friends to watch . But then the dishwasher , who is Albert 's friend  --  the French call a dishwasher a plongeur , which means a diver : in New York they call him a pearl diver , which tells you what country there 's hope for dishwashers in  --  tells Albert that the shady character is bringing down some court official to see that Albert is trying to get himself fired , which would be the same thing as quitting , so Albert becomes a model waiter , and that 's how the first act ends , with Albert working sixteen hours a day as a garcon de card and planning to live it up like a millionaire the rest of the time , except I left some of the characters and a lot of the jokes out because I could n't understand them . " <p> Harry wanted to tell Helen about the beginning of act two , which takes place in a restaurant de nuit Albert goes to after he finishes work at midnight , and about the funny scenes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new fancy woman , his cocotte , complaining that he wants her to study the piano and English ; about the police informer or the fact that  --  inevitably , Harry thought  --  the former virgin and her gypsy or Hungarian sisters have been hired to sing in that very restaurant that very night . But Harry had so clearly failed , in describing the first act , to communicate the joy and humor of the piece that it would have been wrong of him , the opposite of entertaining , to insist on telling more until he found a better way of telling it . <p> " Do you mind if we try one or two of the Russian nightclubs ? " Harry asked . " I think they are the one place left that might still have bands of gypsy musicians strolling from table to table , trying to collect money directly from the customers . " Harry violated his own resolve , broke down in helpless laughter . " You know , the funniest scene in the whole play so far is when Albert  --  sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees that his singing girlfriend , whom he is scared to death of , is coming to their table to ask for money ; so Albert grabs his napkin , stands up behind his own chair , drapes the napkin over his arm , and pretends to be a waiter ! What a genius Tristan Bernard must have been to work out a scene where a waiter pretends to be a waiter in order to disguise himself ! " <p> Harry understood how Helen had probably felt when she led him to paintings she admired or even loved and he politely smiled and nodded and tried unsuccessfully to understand what had moved her . He was more used to having an audience , though , a market , so he thought it probably bothered him more . Helen was more mature , more complete than he was . Her own love for what she saw was enough for her ; she did n't need Harry to share it . <p> Harry got out of the cab midway between Place Tristan Bernard and Avenue Niel ; he planned to arrive at Petrissans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-fetched as he knew it was , there were still employees of the local stores who played cards in the cafe over lunch , still a warning bell that rang to end their games and send them scurrying back behind the counters of the grands magasins . He wondered how close to the truth Tristan Bernard had come , whether it would be the the daughter or granddaughter of the original Yvonne who would be sitting at the tall chair at the caisse , making change and keeping a sharp eye on the waiters to make sure they cleared the tables promptly , and an even sharper eye when they went to the cellar to replenish the stores of wine . <p> Petrissans was so modest in appearance , the card so unlike most cafes , that Harry almost walked by it this time , too . It was the wine shop that caught his eye , and only then did he notice the curtained window and simple doorway to the left , the white oblong of paper , which could only be a menu , posted in a small frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would have imagined a wider , more exuberant doorway was necessary  --  at least in the past  --  to handle the sudden outpouring of customers as the lunch hour ended . He crossed Avenue Niel , read " Petrissans " painted over the window of the wine shop , the same name printed at the head of the menu of moderately priced cold luncheon plates . <p> Harry had to master a sudden and strong impulse to keep walking . Not only was the doorway too narrow to accommodate the Little Cafe 's clientele , but even the mid-range prices on the menu would likely be too high for most department-store clerks . There had always been , too , hidden away in some corner of his mind , the question of the champagnes partout ailleurs introuvables , of how to reconcile those fine and rare wines with customers who waited for a bell to send them rushing back to their shop counters . No joyous noise breached the decorum of the heavy wooden door . <p> Harry 's first reaction , as he stepped across the threshold into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewilderment . There was no garcon de card : a very young woman , a lace apron over her severe black dress , was waiting table ; another woman , much older and rather stately , presided at the tiny bar . Harry took a seat on the hard-cushioned banquette deep along the wall opposite the bar so he would have the whole room under his eyes , could rediscover and recreate the Little Cafe at his leisure . <p> Already as he was unslinging his book bag , his copy of Le Petit Cafe with a bookmark at the crucial final scene , Harry 's mind was racing to justify the changes . Perhaps Petrissans  --  the Little Cafe  --  had not changed at all . Perhaps for reasons of staging , Tristan Bernard had had to play down the formality of the space , disregard the elaborate moldings , eliminate the wine shop , imagine a tall chair for Yvonne to perch on and survey the room . All that would have been acceptable had there only been a huge clock , a bell , customers bent happily over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's progress , the other on the clock . The customers at Petrissans , well-groomed and richly dressed , were sipping wine or reading or in couples talking quietly , their voices carrying to Harry 's ears only as the gentlest of murmurs . Perhaps the exuberance and joy were still there , only less ostentatious , less theatrical . <p> " Monsieur desire ? " <p> Harry had not noticed the young woman approaching . Eighty years ago , it would surely have been right to order beer or the house wine fresh from the watered cask . Instead , Harry surprised himself . " Vous avez des rares champagnes ? " he asked . <p> " De tres rares , " the waitress smiled . <p> Albert , if there had ever been one , would certainly have approved . Harry was not so sure about the other customers . He saw no champagne bottles wrapped in towels and sitting in silver buckets alongside any other table . There were no young women laughing  --  few women and none young  --  and no laughter anyway . The boisterousness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to embrace him were nowhere to be seen . He wished Helen , who was so much more subtle a psychologist , who had proved already in England how much of the past she could see in the present , were sitting there with him , explaining how these finely drawn faces at Petrissans , full of self-awareness and restraint  --  or so it seemed to Harry  --  touched lightly even with sadness , could have grown out of the faces roaring with hilarity that Tristan Bernard wrote about . <p> Harry sipped the delicious champagne , the most fragrant and delicate he had ever had , cool and biting , reminding him of a late-autumn afternoon , of country walks as a child with his parents , of a New England foliage tour with Helen before their first child was born , and discreetly studied the faces of his fellow patrons , on which the faintest smile , the slightest upturning of the lips , seemed to take on the quality of laughter , so that Harry even imagined he heard the ghost of the sound . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away the silver bucket with the empty bottle . He watched her go . His mind felt unnaturally clear , capable of the finest distinctions . He could taste grief and champagne at the same time , feel elation at the same time he was losing hope . Maybe it was n't just time and history working their changes . Maybe only actors in makeup had ever been able to have a drink in le Petit Cafe , and then the drink was probably only colored water , not even as potent as Albert 's watered wine . Harry felt himself smiling at the notion , had to restrain himself from laughing aloud . <p> " Of course they 'll have to be redesigned for the American market , larger pieces , fewer steps ; but that 's not the main thing the Germans missed . By the time I 'm finished , I 'll be able to turn their own stuff around and sell it back to them . Just a matter of talking to my lawyers first , before I start work . " <p> Gutted cartons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations were scattered across their hotel room , from the antechamber to the glassed-in balcony facing the inner garden . A serving trolley with a silver coffeepot over a tiny flame was parked alongside Harry 's table , and a fine china cup was balanced precariously near the elaborate construction over which Harry 's fingers flew as he spoke to Helen . <p> " I wonder how much difficulty an American twelve-year-old will be willing to put up with these days . Will he be as patient as we used to be with erector sets , all those different-sized girders to classify and arrange ? Probably not . We 'll have to do market surveys . See how much today 's kids are willing to do to get away from those two-dimensional screens and make something come alive with their hands , create a future they can touch . <p> " The big thing , though , that the Germans missed is that it does n't have to be just an item-at-a-time business  --  a rocket ship here , a space platform there . They should have realized that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up whole new worlds . <p> " Look  --  and this is just a sketch , because I could n't get the right kind of wire in the damn French hardware store or they could n't understand me  --  but imagine that these wires are silver .... " Harry held up what might have been three or four different items from the Vienna toy store , except that now they were joined by feathery copper wires , had almost the delicacy of sculpture . " The kids can build their own worlds in space if they only learn to trust their own hands and imagination . " Harry smiled and extended his own hands , which were trembling slightly , maybe from the effects of all the coffee he had swallowed to drown the champagne . <p> Even though he repeatedly reassured Helen that he had no intention of sacrificing the benefits of travel , the freedom money gave them , for the sake of these new toys , she was furious , contemptuous of his decision to go back into the business . " Do you know how Tristan Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arguments that preceded their separation . " An old man walking the streets of Paris after World War II with his hearing aid turned off because he could not stand to hear what people were saying . The French had thrown him  --  a man of eighty , no more a Jew than you are  --  into the Drancy concentration camp . He was lucky not to have wound up in Auschwitz . " <p> For years Harry would regale new friends and acquaintances with the plot of Le Petit Card . " The really great moment comes in the third act , when Albert is back working as a very rich waiter and his two women come to insist he marry them . The cocotte is only teasing , but the other one , the former-virgin singing gypsy , is really serious , is the true obstacle between Harry and the proprietor 's daughter . <p> " Well , it turns out "  --  at this point Harry would usually have trouble containing himself  --  " it turns out that her four singing-gypsy sisters are really her daughters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least three other children , including the Russian giant at the Folies-Bergere ! Can you imagine ? " Harry would feel a breath of coldness then , feel his laughter going a little thin . He could not keep himself from missing Helen or thinking of Tristan Bernard with his hearing aid turned off . But then he would recover his spirits and roar with laughter . " And Albert thought she was a virgin ! " Tears would pour down Harry 's face . " What could be funnier than that ? " <p> <p> By Carl Schiffman <p>
