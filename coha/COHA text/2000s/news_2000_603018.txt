<p> &lt;&gt; Most investors know by now which mutual funds produced chart-topping returns in 1999 measured by the average return of their U.S. diversified mutual funds . &lt;&gt; <p> Despite the growth of mutual fund supermarkets and online brokers , many people continue to invest most of their money with one fund family . <p> It 's more convenient  --  one statement instead of four or five  --  and sometimes less expensive . In addition , many companies hire one fund group to manage their 401(k) plan , which means their workers have most of their retirement savings in one family of funds . <p> The good news for family-oriented investors is that 1999 was a great year for the 10 fund families that manage the most stock fund assets . The families on this page collectively manage nearly 60% of all the money invested in U.S. diversified stock funds , according to Lipper , the fund tracker . ( Diversified funds are those that do n't limit themselves to one type of stock , such as Internet stocks . ) <p> Of course , an average covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comparison can tell you a lot about a fund family 's style and its abilities . <p> Overall , the average return for diversified U.S. stock funds at eight of the Big 10 families beat the Standard &; Poor 's 500 index 's 21% return last year . And six families ' averages beat the 27.1% average for all diversified stock funds . <p> John Rekenthaler , research director at fund-tracker Morningstar , says those results confirm what he suspected : In fund families , bigger is better . Overall , big fund groups tend to outperform smaller firms because " they have more resources , they have more researchers and more people " managing money , he says . <p> Mile-high returns <p> Mountain cooks learn early that cakes rise faster at high altitudes . Apparently , the same is true for mutual funds , or at least those managed by Denver-based Janus Capital . With an average return of 79.2% for its diversified U.S. stock funds in 1999 , Janus ' return was nearly double that of its nearest competitor , the AIM funds . <p> Janus ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors have been in vogue among investors for years . And its managers are willing to make big bets on fast-growing technology stocks . Three Janus funds  --  Venture , Enterprise and Janus Olympus  --  gained more than 100% in 1999 , largely due to big stakes in telecommunications , Internet and software stocks . <p> With the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index up 86% , technology was a can't-miss bet . But if tech collapses this year , Janus could ski right off a cliff , analysts say . " Janus is obviously an industry leader now , but it still acts like a boutique , " Rekenthaler says . <p> Michael Lipper , president of the fund data company that bears his name , says other fund families offer funds with a greater variety of investing styles , which protects them if one style or sector goes bad . Janus offers only nine diversified stock funds , and all but two are growth funds . <p> There are signs Janus is trying to change . It plans to launch a value fund soon . But Jim Craig , chief investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the best companies , many of which are in the technology sector . " We concentrate our efforts on the most dynamic areas of the economy , " he says . " So we 're not spending a lot of time visiting paper and chemical companies . " <p> If technology falls out of favor , Janus funds will suffer , but so will the rest of the market , Craig says . Technology stocks now account for about 30% of the S &P; 500 index vs. only 21% at Janus Fund , Janus ' most popular offering . <p> Middle of the pack <p> As the first- and second-largest fund families respectively , Fidelity and Vanguard have always engaged in a bit of chest-bumping . In 1999 , Fidelity was the winner , with an average U.S. diversified stock fund return of 30.3% vs. 22.7% for Vanguard . <p> Fidelity 's average was helped mightily by the same phenomenon that hoisted Janus : big investments in fast-moving growth stocks . Fidelity New Millennium Fund , which invests in midsize growth stocks , jumped 109% , helped by a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . Investments in Internet infrastructure stocks also helped Fidelity Aggressive Growth post a 103% gain . At the other end of Fidelity 's lineup were more conservative value and equity-income funds , which tend to steer clear of high-risk , low-earnings Internet companies . Most of those funds rose less than 10% last year . <p> Although Vanguard pioneered index investing , a strategy that aims to match the returns of the overall market , the Valley Forge , Pa. , fund group actually beat a big benchmark last year . Its average U.S. diversified stock fund , including 15 index funds and 17 actively managed funds , was up 22.7% vs. 21% for the S &P; 500 . <p> Again , funds with big stakes in growth stocks made the difference . Vanguard Capital Opportunity and Primecap , actively managed by the same team , rose 98% and 41% , respectively . But as was the case at Fidelity , Vanguard 's value funds dragged down the average . Vanguard Windsor II , a value fund that invests in big , undervalued and unloved companies , fell 5.8% ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , dropped 2.7% . <p> At the bottom <p> The American Funds family and T. Rowe Price are eat-your-peas fund groups : Their expenses are low , and their managers stick to their funds ' mandates , refusing to follow investing fads . Their managers generally eschew companies with big dreams and no earnings . <p> Those characteristics make both fund groups popular with conservative investors , but their investing styles guaranteed less-than-stellar returns in 1999 . Rekenthaler believes they are facing pressure to loosen up , because their risk-averse philosophies make it hard to bet on technology . But even if they continue to offer fund menus heavy on vegetables , investors should n't discount these families . They 're well suited to nervous types who ca n't bear to see a fund lose 30% in a week . And someday , their investment styles will return to favor , Rekenthaler says . <p> " It 's important to evaluate performance from a risk-aware perspective , " he says . " There will be years  --  and it might be this year  - -  when T. Rowe Price and American will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here are average returns for diversified U.S. stock funds at the 10 mutual fund groups that have the most assets in diversified U.S. stock funds .
