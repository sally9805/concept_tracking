To an outsider , the grieving at the Burns Bungalows looked like revels . Mrs. Oates , the registered guest , counted five men climbing the hill to the main office with six-packs of beer in each hand . Women came , too , bearing plates covered with dishtowels , babies , or crock pots in their arms , or long bottles wrapped in paper bags . Mrs. Oates turned back the old curtain on her unit and watched them arrive-the inhabitants . Some looked like fishermen , young whiskered boys with honest eyes , sinewy from their struggles on the ocean . In the yard , a police official climbed out of a marked car . He hitched his pants to the lip of his belly , then opened the rear door to the poke and brought out a flowered casserole . <p> Two young women who 'd borne the dead man babies still lived here , fanning flames . Over cocktails in the office the night before , they 'd told her stories : Becky and Melody were the names . Look at us , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could n't see themselves and thought that she might see something . Becky urged Mrs. Oates to join the mourning party . " You seem like real people ! " Becky said . <p> Why not ? thought Mrs. Oates . She was drawn to human interest-and all the talk was rich . Without looking , she ran red lipstick over her mouth . Then the curtain swung down over the rotten jamb , and Mrs. Oates appeared in the dirt yard with a package of corn nuts and the remains of her bottle of rye to chip in . <p> Buck Burns was the dead man 's name ; his mother and father ran the Bungalows and were the hosts of the party . While mourners walked up the hill from town and Mrs. Oates walked down from her bungalow , Mrs. Burns stood in the kitchenette of the front office among bowls of ambrosia . She wore her black hair like a hat , piled and sprayed into a nest . She wore tight slacks and a sweater , and two strings of pearls around her neck a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A plate of cream cheese and cherry sandwiches lay broken on the floor in front of her , and the pink triangles looked abused . Buck 's dog lay mangy on the linoleum , gnawing on an old deer bone . When Mrs. Burns bent over to pick lint from her slacks , the dog jumped up and wrapped its forelegs around her , drooling from its black lips . <p> " Git on ! " she told it . She shifted her cigarette to the other corner of her mouth and kicked the dog out of her way . " Git on ! " <p> Mr. Burns came up behind and hooked the dog 's collar in his hand , and while Mrs. Burns swept crumbs into a piece of the broken plate , he took the dog outside and tied it up again to the metal chair beside the swimming pool , a blue hole in the front yard filled with birch leaves and brown water . <p> Buck 's dog had returned to Maine that morning by air from Florida , and Mr. Burns had gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke down , and he had to take his wife 's old Plymouth Fury to fetch the animal in Bangor , a bristle of black wire-hair drugged and fouled in a loaner cage . On the way home , while Mr. Burns dozed with the car running in the parking lot of the Cheese House , the dog woke and chewed out the upholstery in the back seat . When at last Mr. Burns pulled into the Bungalows , the dog ran wheezing down to its old haunts on Second Summer Street and mounted the Greens ' Pekingese . The dog also killed a cat , which fortunately belonged to no one . <p> When he came back indoors , Mrs. Burns , without turning around , asked him for a corkscrew . In his slow no-thinking way , Mr. Burns tried to mount her from behind . She walked away toward the sink , and left him hunched there . " Get off me , Buzz , it 's not the time , ' she said . <p> I know it " he told her in his high voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her teeth , which ended with a crooked smile . " You ca n't do much , anyway , " she said . Where 's that wine ? " <p> " It 's behind you , " he said . <p> " Oh , my God , you 're going to give them Ripple ? " <p> He looked at the bottle . " It 's wine , is n't it ? " <p> " I guess ; you could piss in a glass , those girls would n't know the difference from Blue Nun . " She stubbed out her cigarette in a seashell . <p> Mr. Burns 's face emptied , and his blue eyes closed . This peacefulness came from the Thorazine he took every day , by arrangement with the court officer and Mrs. Burns , who wore a metal plate in her head from where Mr. Burns got her accidentally with his Ruger 10/22 rifle one time . <p> Becky greeted Mrs. Oates in the office and invited her to sit down in Mr. Burns 's tweedy chair on wheels . The mourners stood , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paneled walls . Becky went back and forth between the office and the kitchenette , bringing in bowls and plates of food . Most of the time she also carried a year-old baby , not the one by the dead man , but a fisherman 's child . The dead man 's babies had grown up already into wild-looking boys . <p> Above the mourners ' faces on the walls hung Mr. Burns 's gallery of animal mounts . He had taken up taxidermy years ago on Dr. Adenoy 's advice . Mrs. Oates looked the stuffed animals over and praised them , which pleased the mourners . Mr. Burns had real feeling , it turned out , for animals killed on the island , and he did a good job of lifting them up from ruined victims of Star Route traffic into examples of their species . A gray owl that had once devastated some chickens hung on the wall beside an eight-point buck with some of its velvet intact and white rings around its black glass eyes . There was a cockatoo Mrs. Burns had taught , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few of Mr. Burns 's early efforts hung there , too , including a squirrel he had cut down so neatly it looked like a vole . <p> The mourners gathered here because it was the natural setting ; Buck Burns had lived at the Bungalows all his life until he moved away . Anyone could see they were n't much , a handful of oneroom cabins flung down in a clearing of birch woods . Daylight shone in through the knotty pine boards , and no-see-ums bred in the spongy window frames . Mr. Burns had built the place himself , before he got too drugged to drive a nail , and it still held the town 's memory of those years when Buck had his parties and the Burnses did n't care who came or what they did . <p> Now the guests helped themselves to the beer they brought , except Becky and Melody , who , on account of Becky 's nursing her baby , pressed Mrs. Burns for wine . Their boys were eight or nine years old , both curly-haired and dirty blond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they came from the church basket . A little girl came in with them , and soon they all disappeared out back . <p> Mrs. Oates was welcome ; several people gave her beer . She was pleased with a drink in her hand to listen to stories of the dead man 's life and family . Mr. Burns had fallen into a doze with his back up against the refrigerator-the lulling sound of his breathing carried through the door-and Becky was unraveling that history when Burton Martin , a fisherman and the father of the baby Becky was nursing at her breast , stood up to make a speech . " It 's too early , Burton " Becky protested , but Burton insisted that he wanted to speak before everyone got too drunk to listen , and finally out of respect for the dead man , everyone gave him their ears . Mrs. Burns came in , and the silence grew until even Mr. Burns roused himself and leaned in his sleepy way on the frame of the door . <p> Burton stowed his hands deep in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it . Buck Burns was larger than life and dangerous beyond the treachery of rules or the law , he said . Temptations other boys fought off by the strength of their character rushed through him like blood in a vein . But his wanting nature and good looks brought out the loyalty people from Black Island felt toward the things that were wilder here-sour berries on the barrens , lobsters crawling in the cold ocean , granite cliffs cracking boats like eggshells and dropping yellow-slickered fishermen into the water . <p> Those who loved Buck-and they were many-always felt they were going to save him . One time when Buck rolled a Corvair , Burton breathed his own breath into Buck 's mouth for eighteen minutes before emergency help arrived-fire engine , police car , the helicopter landing right on the straightaway . But Burton had n't saved Buck-no one had . <p> When Buck was eighteen , Burton went on , an advertising agency swooped down on Black Island and saw in him what the town had always seen . The agency snatched him up like a mussel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a working man with a beer in his hand : a Clammer , a Sardine Packer , a Fisherman with His Dog . Buck Burns was not any of those things , but he gave them what they wanted . Millions of people saw it and wanted it , Buck 's fire and aloofness-he sold more beer than any face the agency ever had . They still had the billboard of him drinking up in Bangor , across the street from Freeze 's , and even in town you could n't look at a magazine in the offices of Dr. Adenoy without seeing Buck and a beer in his hand . He used to be on TV , too , until those commercials got outlawed ; Buck was too convincing . Burton asked everyone to remember the one of him fishing in a blizzard , alone on the ocean with his thirst . ( Mrs. Oates shook her head up and down . She remembered it well , the angrylooking young man , how the ball in his throat rose and fell with simple pleasure from the bottle ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burton told them , to follow where Buck went . Burton himself had tried taking a few beers and his own dog out on his lobster boat , and the dog went over on a haul chain and drowned . <p> No matter what Buck did , the town was loyal . The time he drove a borrowed car off the end of the wharf and almost wrecked a sailboat , he ended up in jail , but the city council bailed him out in a vote of civic pride . And who did n't remember those drag races out by the straightaway ? Buck sailed fearlessly into the dark , past Kartland and Dennis 's restaurant at one hundred miles an hour , and faster than anyone he was gone , swallowed up in his own noise . A few men wept and hooted , remembering what it was like out there , and even Mrs. Oates wiped a tear from her eye with an end of her boiled wool jacket . <p> Burton hung his head and said that Buck Burns was a treasure and the town had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no prisoners , by God . Burton rattled the pockets of his pants and brought up some of his trinkets-a shark 's tooth , copper-plated ball bearings-and turned them over in his hand . <p> Then he asked the mourners to reach out their arms to each other . It seemed like two minutes before anyone could do it ; touching was hard . Mrs. Burns left the room . Finally Mrs. Oates reached out her hands to Becky 's and Melody 's hands and squeezed . Others followed along . Even Buck 's boys came in and awkwardly embraced their mothers before helping themselves to the ambrosia . <p> When the touching was over , Mrs. Burns came back to join the conversation . The subject was her favorite : what a wild man Buck was . She stood in the middle of the office , lit a cigarette , then squinted through smoke at Becky and said , " Ask me what happened to all the money he made . " <p> Mrs. Oates leaned forward on her chair . Becky pulled up her shirt and exposed a surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . Her eyes rolled up . <p> " He pissed it away , every penny , " Mrs. Burns said grandly . <p> The baby attached itself for an instant to the breast , pulled away , and looked at Mrs. Burns . Then it-another boy-climbed down off Becky 's lap and crawled over to the cords that ran to the neon sign out front . <p> Not everyone believed that Buck had pissed away every penny of the money he made from those beer commercials , a hundred thousand or a million , however much it really was . When checks used to come from the agency , Becky and Melody suggested uses for the money-snowmobiles , dope , groceries , trips up to the Bangor Mall-and Buck had shared it freely while it lasted . Now the future swelled , and if there was any money left , the fate of their two boys or any other children who turned up probably hung on the thread of Mrs. Burns 's interest . <p> Mrs. Oates removed her shoes and crossed her bare feet in Mr. Burns 's chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrow space between her front teeth . " That 's the way with so many in show business " she said , sweeping in Mrs. Burns , Becky , and Melody with a nod . " Following the star is a trail of broken hearts ! <p> Becky and Melody smiled and sipped their wine , but Mrs. Burns 's head shot up . " Buck went to Miami by himself , " she corrected the guest . " He was going to shoot those commercials in the Keys . ' <p> Mrs. Oates nodded . " You do n't have to tell me about Miami , ' she said . " I 've lived down in Daytona , near the raceway . You do n't know what you 've got right here : four seasons and real people . ' She looked around her , taking them all in . <p> " Miami 's a good town , ' Burton Martin put in . " I spent a couple of days there when I went to Disney World . ' <p> Mrs. Oates lifted an eyebrow in surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life at four o'clock in the morning and went alone to the water to haul lobster traps . <p> " I do n't care two cents for Walt Disney World , " Mrs. Burns told him . " I 've got to settle Bucks estate and collect his cremains . I want to see some things he seen-Naples , Florida , the Keys , the Dry Tortugas . I 'm taking his postcards with me . ' <p> Nobody challenged her . Nobody knew much about Buck after he went to Florida , except that he must have liked it there . Nothing was ever heard from him again for seven or eight years until word came that he was dead . ( The word came to Mrs. Burns from a man named Mr. Pinks , who called and said Buck had died suddenly in the motel he lived in down there ; drugs had been hard on his heart . Death coming suddenly at thirty seemed for Buck Burns like a natural cause ; everyone was struck , but no one questioned it . ) <p> Silence enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she scratched her lighter with her thumb and lit a cigarette . <p> " You going to bring the ashes home ? " Burton finally asked . <p> " If he wanted to stick around here forever he would 've , " Mrs. Burns said , then she added with a sudden spark , " But I might do it , anyway , scatter him out over the straightaway . " <p> A few of the men laughed appreciatively . Melody clicked her tongue , stood up , and walked off into the kitchenette . In a few seconds she was back with a bottle of wine ; she poured some out for herself and Becky . Mr. Burns leaned against the door , turning an old bone over in his hands . Mrs. Burns captured his blurred face in her gaze , then looked around the room and said , as if in her own defense , " He ca n't leave the state , he 's got his parole . ' <p> It 's not parole , I 'm on medication ! " said Mr. Burns in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall force of her rage . " You think you 're free to go as you please ? People have a right to know what you are ! " she shouted . <p> The mourners turned to hear . What was a man after he shot his wife on his own front porch , and had to live with her for twentyone years afterward , medicated to within an inch of unconsciousness ? Mrs. Burns did n't say . Her eyes darted back and forth across the faces arranged along the walls of the office , the animal mounts and underneath them the faces of the mourners . " And anyone who criticizes Buck for getting cremated , that 's just how I want it when I go , " she said loudly . " That 's just how I want it . No religion ! No prayers ! Just a sack of soot . ' <p> " Amen , " said Mr. Burns . <p> " You want me to help you get your stuff together ? " Becky asked her . <p> " I 'm not going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want is my can of hairspray and a nightgown . I want to take those postcards Buck wrote . That 's all . ' Then she went off alone to gather those things up . <p> Mrs. Burns , Mrs. Burns ! The mourners shook their heads and explained for the benefit of Mrs. Oates that Bucks mother was raised years ago in the clutch of religion . Instead of school she went around the windy outer islands climbing granite hills with a Bible and pamphlets in her mittens ; she learned to count by adding souls . Her mother , an old bulb-eyed Canadian , singlehandedly ran the Church of the Nazarene and made Mrs. Burns ride out on the mail boat in every weather . Over time most of those fishing families embraced the notion of a wrathful God . <p> Mrs. Burns came out to save Mr. Burns on Rockrib Island when they were both fifteen . His pa was trawling at sea . She had a certain fire from her upbringing and a highly developed sense of vengeance , it turned out . in the years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her rages , and it all went from her into Buck ; her blood was in him and made him who he was . <p> Mrs. Oates never had to move from Mr. Burns 's chair . People milled around her and brought her beer ; they told her about Buck , how he had a unit of his own at the Bungalows from the time he was nine or ten years old ; that was the best the Burnses could do to protect their son from themselves . Buck raised himself , almost ; at seventeen , he already had two sons . The police chief and Dr. Adenoy , both drawn to Mrs. Oates , recalled for her the night the first baby was born to Becky : Buck landed in the hospital , too . He 'd gone out for a ride with Melody , which ended when he skidded off the Star Route and ruined her face with shards of glass . Dr. Adenoy numbed her with thirty-six shots of lidocaine and pulled out most of the shards with a needle , but Melody could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time . <p> Some people believed that if only Buck could have seen that first baby boy , Becky 's , naked and stippled with cold , his tiny arms rising straight up in the incubator , he might have wanted to be a father . But his eyes were covered with bandages , and he was unconscious . Blame spread from Melody to Becky . Those girls were crazy fools ! people said . Mixing with Buck Burns ! The next winter both girls were steering strollers , riding Buck 's babies all around town as if they were jacked-up cars . <p> Mrs. Oates wondered about Mr. Burns . Becky said things went wrong for him years ago . He used to run the Bungalows when they were a lodge , back when hunters used to come up weekends from Portland or Boston and sit up all night in the office , drink beer and bourbon , and lay log after log on the woodstove . Some did n't know to chase deer that ran gut shot . Mr. Burns could hear deer moo in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scrape in a birch tree twenty feet away . It was the best thing about him , Becky said , the way he gutted a deer on the spot and put the heart and the liver in a plastic bag in his jacket and cut out the glands and brought even pretty big ones in around his shoulders , still hot on his neck , and butchered them himself For years he weathered the storms Mrs. Burns kicked up and got the city men in and out in a day and a half with a few steaks from deer he had hung and cured before . <p> " Venison-yum ! " said Mrs. Oates in an encouraging tone . <p> The accident happened when Buck was around nine , Becky said . Mr. Burns did n't come home all night , and Mrs. Burns came out to the front porch , wiping her hands on a dishtowel , to look for him . He testified in court that he took her for a white-tail deer , and grazed the skull above her eye with one of the lead slugs he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . " Horrible-horrible ! " <p> The jurors understood that a man hunting white-tails with an anticipating mind can see anything he needs to see , antlers in the chokecherry , the white tail in a dishtowel . That 's just how the hunter thinks . The verdict was bad luck for Mrs. Burns : she talked too much in court , unraveled too many ancient arguments , and threw the judge and jury into further sympathy with Mr. Burns . But the incident ate away at her . She filed her own civil case and won the right to keep Mr. Burns medicated for life . <p> Mrs. Oates laughed frankly and shook her head up and down . <p> On medication Mr. Burns was still recognizable , but more subdued , Becky said . He slept seventeen or eighteen hours a day with his squirrel skins and slabs of wax molded in the shape of wildlife . No one knew how Mr. Burns breathed in there , with the chemicals he used to kill the fleas and lice , the fumes that hung on him of almonds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court or Mrs. Burns , although once in a while at night he went out into the woods and shined some deer , just to get a look at them . Sometimes Buck used to go along . <p> When the boys were born , first Becky moved into the Bungalows , and then Melody . They took bungalows instead of regular child support and lived like a kind of family , even after Buck left them all and moved to Florida . The Bungalows did n't rent much , anyway . New deer laws came in , and the paying hunters went fishing on the Allagash , or up to Greenville where the blackflies bit like dogs . <p> Mrs. Oates expressed no interest in moving from her chair , and Becky brought her food on a plate and another beer . Mrs. Oates filled in the blanks of the conversation and speculated on the future of the Burnses . They might separate , Mrs. Burns might stay in Florida , remarry ; Mrs. Oates knew from her own experience that the loss of a loved one set you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruckus in the office . Some young men were recounting with the police chief and the doctor certain remarks Buck Burns got off to cops ten years ago , simulating with grinding sounds in their throats the trajectory of doomed cars . <p> Mrs. Oates let it leak that she had an insurance settlement from Mr. Oates , who died of diverticulitis in Boston . She could go anywhere she wanted ; she was looking for a fresh start and a simple life . She wanted four seasons and real people , and she dreamed of opening up a bed and breakfast in a place like this . Melody raised her glass and drank , her eyes narrow , imagining , but Becky jumped at it . Why not the Burns Bungalows ? Why not here ? <p> Mrs. Burns had never been interested in keeping up the Bungalows , and now that she was leaving , she brought back dark memories : a cold person walking out onto a front porch in the woods holding a dishtowel in her hands during the season when the only white that mattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crazy one ? Then she kept him drugged for years . <p> And Mrs. Burns was leaving : she came in with a small pink valise in one hand and a cigarette in the other . She found Mr. Burns dozing in the doorway and pulled on one of his earlobes to wake him . He opened his eyes and wiped his face with the back of his hand . " I 'm going to see to Buck ; you brook it here " she said , and kissed him . It left a red mark on his cheek . <p> She climbed into her Fury and shot off to the airport . After she left , Burton said it was too bad no one had put Mrs. Burns to bed or sedated her . Now she was gone , he felt they would never see her again . <p> By the time Mrs. Burns left , it was almost five o'clock . Fred Green poured drinks from Mrs. Oates 's bottle into paper cups and passed them around . Mrs. Oates never moved from Mr. Burns 's chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone and ate some of everything Becky brought her on a plate . <p> The town was sitting , she said , on a gold mine ; this pristine beauty was a treasure-the blueberry barrens , the granite cliffs , the lobsters . " It would n't take much to turn this place around , " she observed , looking around the office in a professional way . " You want to get new blood in . Those Arctic Cats , cross-country skiers . " She gestured at the walls , at the gallery of animals . " Even these stuffed animals might be a draw if the rooms were dean . " <p> The mourning went on late . Some rougher stories came up about Buck and some other girls . Mrs. Oates did an impression of Melody , while Melody was in the bathroom : turned her head to one side and pulled a wineglass out of her nose . Even Becky laughed . <p> Fred Green took down Mr. Burns 's stuffed owl from its pin on the wall and laid it on the space heater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood floor ; a blue line rolled across the boards . Some of the men put it out with bottles of beer . Melody took the stag 's head off the wall and leaned it up in a chair behind the front desk . She cocked an imaginary rifle and said , " That you , dear ? " Mr. Burns , wherever he was , must have heard the mourners laughing . The walls of the office shook . <p> In the middle of it all , an animal noise drifted in from the yard . Becky jumped up and ran out of the office screaming . Melody and Burton followed her out , but Mrs. Oates stayed where she was . <p> The air was already deep blue over the yard , striped black by the birch trees . Buck 's dog ran loose , kicking up dust from the ground where Becky 's baby lay facing upward a little distance from the swimming pool . The baby was howling and yelling , and Becky ran toward it . It was hard to tell what had happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noises in its throat , jumping up and running around in a circle , and crouching down again . Becky ran across the uneven yard , veering toward the baby in the pixilated manner of the dog . She reached down to grab her baby , and the dog rushed her , rose up into the air , and bit her on the hand . Becky tore her hand away , and her lips peeled back as if she might bite the dog , but instead she put her hand in her mouth and sucked . Her face looked wild with tears and blood . <p> Melody moved up behind the dog and hooked her hand under the collar . She pulled it away from Becky and tied it by its leash to the metal chair beside the swimming pool . <p> The baby yelled , but it did n't look punctured anywhere . Becky held it in her arms , put her breast in its mouth , and sucked on her own hurt hand to draw off the blood . Chief Farnsworth stepped out of the office , hitched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Burton also spoke roughly to her . What was the goddamned baby doing out in the dark near the swimming pool ? The dog was probably saving it . Becky stood and listened , hiccupping as her sobs wore down , her hand in her mouth , the long baby in her arms , its head up inside her shirt , its mouth sucking hard . She looked at Burton in an even way , then she turned and walked back to the office with the baby and shut the door . <p> " Is she going to be okay with it ? " someone asked . <p> " It 's her baby , " snapped Melody . <p> " You ought to go on after her , Burton , " Chief Farnsworth said , but Burton said , " Do I look crazy ? " <p> Dr. Adenoy told Melody to go wash Becky 's hand off and bandage it ; he would come by in the morning . <p> Burton said he had to get up early , but no one paid attention , and in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After Burton left , Melody asked the mourners angrily what kind of man was he , to talk that way to Becky ? But everyone already knew what kind of man Burton was . He was the most hardworking and decent young man in town , except in the matter of Becky and the new baby , and even Becky herself did n't hold that against him . Melody went off to get her bottle of peroxide . On the way to her bungalow , she saw their boys-her son and Becky's-in the blue darkness , playing a game called Bear in the Woods . The girl chased the boys , waving a board stuck through with a nail . <p> Becky opened the door to the office and dosed it behind her . Everything looked destroyed . Mr. Burns 's taxidermy was strewn around on chairs , the floor was sticky with ambrosia and beer , and the table was covered with bottles , plates , and ashes . in the center of Mr. Burns 's chair on wheels , a dark circle spread , where Mrs. Oates had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The dog never settled down . It yowled and whined and threatened the mourners , dragging the chair it was tied to screeching across the concrete . A knot of men argued that the dog would never get over Buck 's death , a dog never did , and the kindest thing was to shoot it quick . Mr. Burns could stuff it in Buck 's memory . Mr. Burns must have sensed the opportunity ; it drew him out of Buck 's bungalow with an old ranch rifle , and he joined them . With a rapturous gesture , Mr. Burns lifted his rifle to his shoulder for the first time in twenty years . But he turned the gun on the mourners . " Git on ! " he shouted . " Go on home ! " <p> That was the end of the party ; the mourners left from there . Mr. Burns sat down on the concrete apron around the swimming pool with his rifle in his lap . The dog stood facing him , and barked all night . <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
