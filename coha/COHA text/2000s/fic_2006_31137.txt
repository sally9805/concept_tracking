Chapter One Never fails . You 're wrapping up the operation when someone blunders onto the season 's big score . OK . I 'm exaggerating . But it 's damn close to what happened . And the final outcome was far more disturbing than any last-minute discovery of a potsherd or hearth . It was May 18 , the second-to-the-last day of the archaeological field school . I had twenty students digging a site on Dewees , a barrier island north of Charleston , South Carolina . I also had a journalist . With the IQ of plankton . " Sixteen bodies ? " Plankton pulled a spiral notebook as his brain strobed visions of Dahmer and Bundy . " Vics ID 'd ? " " The graves are prehistoric . " Two eyes rolled up , narrowed under puffy lids . " Old Indians ? " " Native Americans . " " They got me covering dead Indians ? " No political correctness prize for this guy . " They ? " Icy . " The Moultrie News . The East Cooper community paper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked by the genial grace of days gone by . Its heart is the Peninsula , a district of antebellum homes , cobbled streets , and outdoor markets bounded by the Ashley and Cooper rivers . Charlestonians define their turf by these waterways . Neighborhoods are referred to as " West Ashley " or " East Cooper , " the latterincluding Mount Pleasant , and three islands , Sullivan 's , the Isle of Palms , and Dewees . I assumed plankton 's paper covered that beat . " And you are ? " I asked . " Homer Winborne . " With his five-o'clock shadow and fast food paunch , the guy looked more like Homer Simpson . " We 're busy here , Mr. Winborne . " Winborne ignored that . " Is n't it illegal ? " " We have a permit . The island 's being developed , and this little patch is slated for home sites . " " Why bother ? " Sweat soaked Winborne 's hairline . When he reached for a hanky , I noticed a tick cruising his collar . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina at Charlotte . My students and I are here at the request of the state . " Though the first bit was true , the back end was a stretch . Actually , it happened like this . UNCC 's New World archaeologist normally conducted a student excavation during the short presummer term each May . In late March of this year , the lady had announced her acceptance of a position at Purdue . Busy sending out resumes throughout the winter , she 'd ignored the field school . Sayonara . No instructor . No site . Though my specialty is forensics , and I now work with the dead sent to coroners and medical examiners , my graduate training and early professional career were devoted to the not so recently deceased . For my doctoral research I 'd examined thousands of prehistoric skeletons recovered from North American burial mounds . The field school is one of the Anthropology Department 's most popular courses , and , as usual , was enrolled to capacity . My colleague 's unexpected departure sent the chair into a panic . He begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! A return to my roots ! Two weeks at the beach ! Extra pay ! I thought he was going to throw in a Buick . I 'd suggested Dan Jaffer , a bioarchaeologist and my professional counterpart with the medical examiner/coroner system in the great Palmetto State to our south . I pleaded possible cases at the ME office in Charlotte , or at the Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de medecine legale in Montreal , the two agencies for which I regularly consult . The chair gave it a shot . Good idea , bad timing . Dan Jaffer was on his way to Iraq . I 'd contacted Jaffer and he 'd suggested Dewees as an excavation possibility . A burial ground was slated for destruction , and he 'd been trying to forestall the bulldozers until the site 's significance could be ascertained . Predictably , the developer was ignoring his requests . I 'd contacted the Office of the State Archaeologist in Columbia , and on Dan 's recommendation they 'd accepted my offer to dig some test trenches , thereby greatly displeasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , on our thirteenth and penultimate day , plankton-brain . My patience was fraying like an overused rope . " Name ? " Winborne might have been asking about grass seed . I fought back the urge to walk away . Give him what he wants , I told myself . He 'll leave . Or , with luck , die from the heat . " Temperance Brennan . " " Temperance ? " Amused . " Yes , Homer . " Winborne shrugged . " Do n't hear that name so much . " " I 'm called Tempe . " " Like the town in Utah . " " Arizona . " " Right . What kind of Indians ? " " Probably Sewee . " " How 'd you know stuff was here ? " " Through a colleague at USC-Columbia . " " How 'd he know ? " " He spotted small mounds while doing a survey after the news of an impending development was announced . " Winborne took a moment to make notes in his spiral . Or maybe he was buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . In the distance I could hear student chatter and the clatter of buckets . Overhead , a gull cawed and another answered . " Mounds ? " No one was going to short-list this guy for a Pulitzer . " Following closure of the graves , shells and sand were heaped on top . " " What 's the point in digging them up ? " That was it . I hit the little cretin with the interview terminator . Jargon . " Burial customs are n't well known for aboriginal Southeastern coastal populations , and this site could substantiate or refute ethnohistoric accounts . Many anthropologists believe the Sewee were part of the Cusabo group . According to some sources , Cusabo funerary practices involved defleshing of the corpse , then placement of the bones in bundles or boxes . Others describe the scaffolding of bodies to allow decomposition prior to burial in common graves . " " Holy crap . That 's gross . " " More so than draining the blood from a corpse and replacing it with chemical preservatives , injecting waxes and perfumes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffins and vaults to forestall decay ? " Winborne looked at me as though I 'd spoken Sanskrit . " Who does that ? " " We do . " " So what are you finding ? " " Bones . " " Just bones ? " The tick was now crawling up Winborne 's neck . Give a heads-up ? Screw it . The guy was irritating as hell . I launched into my standard cop and coroner spiel . " The skeleton paints a story of an individual . Sex . Age . Height . Ancestry . In certain cases , medical history or manner of death . " Pointedly glancing at my watch , I followed with my archaeological shtick . " Ancient bones are a source of information on extinct populations . How people lived , how they died , what they ate , what diseases they suffered - " Winborne 's gaze drifted over my shoulder . I turned . Topher Burgess was approaching , various forms of organic and inorganic debris pasted to his sunburned torso . Short and plump , with knit cap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of an undergraduate Smee . " Odd one intruding into three-east . " I waited , but Topher did n't elaborate . Not surprising . On exams , Topher 's essays often consisted of single-sentence answers . Illustrated . " Odd ? " I coaxed . " It 's articulated . " A complete sentence . Gratifying , but not enlightening . I curled my fingers in a " give me more " gesture . " We 're thinking intrusive . " Topher shifted his weight from one bare foot to another . It was a lot to shift . " I 'll check it out in a minute . " Topher nodded , turned , and trudged back to the excavation . " What 's that mean , ' articulated ' ? " The tick had reached Winborne 's ear and appeared to be considering alternate routes . " In proper anatomical alignment . It 's uncommon with secondary burials , corpses put into the ground after loss of the flesh . The bones are usually jumbled , sometimes in clumps . Occasionally in these communal graves one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Could be a lot of reasons . Maybe someone died immediately before closure of a common pit . Maybe the group was moving on , did n't have time to wait out decomposition . " A full ten seconds of scribbling , during which the tick moved out of sight . " Intrusive . What 's that mean ? " " A body was placed in the grave later . Would you like a closer look ? " " It 's what I 'm living for . " Putting hanky to forehead , Winborne sighed as if he were onstage . I crumbled . " There 's a tick in your collar . " Winborne moved faster than it seemed possible for a man of his bulk to move , yanking his collar , doubling over , and batting his neck in one jerk . The tick flew to the sand and righted itself , apparently used to rejection . I set off , skirting clusters of sea oats , their tasseled heads motionless in the heavy air . Only May , and already the mercury was hitting ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be digging here into the summer . I moved quickly , knowing Winborne would n't keep up . Mean ? Yes . But time was short . I had none to waste on a dullard reporter . And I was conscience-clear on the tick . Some student 's boom-box pounded out a tune I did n't recognize by a group whose name I did n't know and would n't remember if told . I 'd have preferred seabirds and surf , though today 's selections were better than the heavy metal the kids usually blasted . Waiting for Winborne , I scanned the excavation . Two test trenches had already been dug and refilled . The first had yielded nothing but sterile soil . The second had produced human bone , early vindication of Jaffer 's suspicions . Three other trenches were still open . At each , students worked trowels , hauled buckets , and sifted earth through mesh screens resting on sawhorse supports . Topher was shooting pictures at the easternmost trench . The rest of his team sat cross-legged , eyeing the focus of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gasping . Mopping his forehead , he fought for breath . " Hot day , " I said . Winborne nodded , face the color of raspberry sherbet . " You OK ? " " Peachy . " I was moving toward Topher when Winborne 's voice stopped me . " We got company . " Turning , I saw a man in a pink Polo shirt and khaki pants hurrying across , not around , the dunes . He was small , almost child-size , with silver-gray hair buzzed to the scalp . I recognized him instantly . Richard L. " Dickie " Dupree , entrepreneur , developer , and all-around sleaze . Dupree was accompanied by a basset whose tongue and belly barely cleared the ground . First a journalist , now Dupree . This day was definitely heading for the scrap heap . Ignoring Winborne , Dupree bore down on me with the determined self-righteousness of a Taliban mullah . The basset hung back to squirt a clump of sea oats . We 've all heard of personal space , that blanket of nothing we need between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen inches . Break in , I get edgy . Some strangers crowd up close because of vision or hearing . Others , because of differing cultural mores . Not Dickie . Dupree believed nearness lent him greater force of expression . Stopping a foot from my face , Dupree crossed his arms and squinted up into my eyes . " Y'all be finishing tomorrow , I expect . " More statement than question . " We will . " I stepped back . " And then ? " Dupree 's face was birdlike , the bones sharp under pink , translucent skin . " I 'll file a preliminary report with the Office of the State Archaeologist next week . " The basset wandered over and started sniffing my leg . It looked to be at least eighty years old . " Colonel , do n't be rude with the little lady . " To me . " Colonel 's getting on . Forgets his manners . " The little lady scratched Colonel behind one mangy ear . " Shame to disappoint folks because of a buncha ole Indians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern gentleman " smile . Probably practiced it in the mirror while clipping his nose hairs . " Many view this country 's heritage as something valuable , " I said . " Ca n't let these things stop progress , though , can we ? " I did not reply . " You do understand my position , ma'am ? " " Yes , sir . I do . " I abhorred Dupree 's position . His goal was money , earned by any means that would n't get him indicted . Screw the rain forest , the wetlands , the seashore , the dunes , the culture that was here when the English arrived . Dickie Dupree would implode the Temple of Artemis if it stood where he wanted to slap up condos . Behind us , Winborne had gone still . I knew he was listening . " And what might this fine document say ? " Another Sheriff of Mayberry smile . " That this area is underlain by a pre-Columbian burial ground . " Dupree 's smile wavered , held . Sensing tension , or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand on my cutoffs . " You know those folks up in Columbia well as I do . A report of that nature will shut me down for some time . That delay will cost me money . " " An archaeological site is a nonrenewable cultural resource . Once it 's gone , it 's gone forever . I ca n't in good conscience allow your needs to influence my findings , Mr. Dupree . " The smile dissolved , and Dupree eyed me coldly . " We 'll just have to see about that . " The veiled threat was little softened by the gentle , Lowcountry drawl . " Yes , sir . We will . " Pulling a pack of Kools from his pocket , Dupree cupped a hand and lit up . Chucking the match , he drew deeply , nodded , and started back toward the dunes , Colonel waddling at his heels . " Mr. Dupree , " I called after him . Dupree stopped , but did n't turn to face me . " It 's environmentally irresponsible to walk on dunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Anger and loathing rose in my chest . " Dickie not your choice for Man of the Year ? " I turned . Winborne was unwrapping a stick of Juicy Fruit . I watched him put the gum in his mouth , daring with my eyes that he toss the paper as Dupree had tossed his match . He got the message . Wordlessly , I hooked a one-eighty and walked to three-east . I could hear Winborne scrabbling along behind me . The students fell silent when I joined them . Eight eyes followed as I hopped down into the trench . Topher handed me a trowel . I squatted , and was enveloped by the smell of freshly turned earth . And something else . Sweet . Fetid . Faint , but undeniable . An odor that should n't be there . My stomach tightened . Dropping to all fours , I examined Topher 's oddity , a segment of vertebral column curving outward from halfway up the western wall . Above me , students threw out explanations . " We were cleaning up the sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos of the stratigraphy . " " We spotted stained soil . " Topher added some brief detail . I was n't listening . I was troweling , creating a profile view of the burial lying to the west of the trench . With each scrape my apprehension was heading north . Thirty minutes of work revealed a spine and upper pelvic rim . I sat back , a tingle of dread crawling my scalp . The bones were connected by muscle and ligament . As I stared , the first fly buzzed in , sun iridescent on its emerald body . Sweet Jesus . Rising , I brushed dirt from my knees . I had to get to a phone . Dickie Dupree had a lot more to worry about than the ancient Sewee . ( Continues ... )
