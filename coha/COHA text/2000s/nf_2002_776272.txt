Battle , combat , violence : // a necessary history // The violence of war inevitably takes us back to a history of the body . In war , bodies strike each other , suffer and inflict suffering . So the reticence of historians over the violence of warfare is connected to the reticence that has long attended a genuine history of medicine ( military medicine even more so ) . Here again Corbin is right when he notes that any history of bodily suffering engages historians . They expose themselves not only to their readers - far more , certainly , than is the case with other kinds of history ( with the possible exception of the history of sexuality ) - but also to the specific pain associated with the subject matter . Propriety , together with an understandable need for personal security ( not to mention academic security ) , are at the root of the widespread , long-standing reticence of many French historians who have chosen to study the violence of warfare . // Annales historians ' in the narrow sense of that term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , and caused damage with their hostility to histoire-bataille ' , or battle history . Actually , the battle history that the Annales founders decried was anything but an actual history of what went on in battles . And Marc Bloch himself , one of the founders of the Annales , was a marvellous historian of combat in both world wars . But in any case , the violence of warfare belongs only outwardly to what Fernand Braudel somewhat condescendingly described as history that is restless ' for it touches on the essential in the history of mankind . If the aim of historians is to start with people , and to undertake a ' history from the bottom up ' , as the Annales school believed , who can deny that for the men who have lived through wars and survived them , wars and their violence have been the most important experiences of their entire lives ? One should note the immense need for self-expression that warfare has always aroused , from the Napoleonic wars to more recent conflicts . It was in order to recount their experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to say something about it ( the great majority never succeeded in verbalising it ) - or just to leave behind a humble trace of it , if only for their descendants - that , from the late eighteenth century on , so many warriors took up the pen , sometimes for the first and last time in their lives . And to neglect the violence of war is to neglect all those men who in growing numbers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries endured that immense ordeal . // Of course , military history has always existed , in every country . But all too often military historians consider it indecent to deal with the problem of violence in combat or to study it as such . Battles and warfare are discussed only from the tactical or strategic angle ; military events are viewed only from a social or political standpoint . On the whole , the reality of war is kept at bay . As a rule , French historiography of warfare has been unconcerned with the violence of the battlefield , the men in the arena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who try to survive and , in a nutshell , the immense stakes that are crystallised in the combat zone . // Avoiding these issues is an error . The violence specific to warfare is a prism that refracts many otherwise invisible aspects of the world . Entire societies can be seen anew , but one must be willing to look closely . In paroxysms of violence everything is stripped naked - starting with men , their bodies , their fantasies and desires , their fears , passions , beliefs and hatreds . The meaning they attribute to the violence of warfare and the result they hope it will bring , the motivations that allow them to kill their fellow men and endure the terror of confrontation - these pertain to something essential - something we shall call their ' representations ' , though the term is too vague . In the end , what happens in combat is inseparable from these representations , for soldiers always fight with their whole selves . // It is not just combatants who can be seen with uncommon clarity through the violent practices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their technical , demographic , economic possibilities and , sometimes , their ' desire to live together ' . We also see political power anew , the legitimacy of which is often rooted in the actions of its representatives on the battlefield . For war is a staging of the political , it renders visible things that are ordinarily hidden from view - the power of some men over others , their power to make men kill one another in a combat fury of extreme brutality . This brutality - and here is the whole problem - is usually widely accepted and borne by all the ordinary combatants charged with implementing it . // In short , by paying too little attention to the violence of war , an essential vector of historical understanding is overlooked and we deny ourselves access to many phenomena of memory-building and recollection , and to the profusion and variety of literary and artistic creation that has accompanied warfare . The history of combat violence is therefore a necessary history . // In countries other than France , schools of history with different traditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians developed an often remarkable military history as early as the 1920s and 1930s , and they have none of the mental blocks that hamper many of their colleagues elsewhere . A certain pragmatism in the study of history , combined with a kind of instinctive suspicion of abstractions and grand systems of thought , allows them to broach the violence of warfare without inhibition . John Keegan , for example , is still not well known to historians on the French side of the Channel . Yet he is among those who has delved deeply into the wide-ranging problem of warfare . Plainly challenging Clausewitz and his overrated dictum that war is ' the continuation of policy by other means ' , he states a deep truth : war is first and foremost a cultural act . // In his major work , The Face of Battle , Keegan daringly focussed exclusively on violence , in defiance of the discipline 's most established rules of caution ; he aimed for a diachronic comparison among the battles of Agincourt , Waterloo and the Somme , investigating the attitudes , behaviour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach but the content was original , for what interested Keegan was precisely what no one had usually been interested in : behind the words used in the conventional accounts , he asked , behind the meaningless expressions everyone used , what exactly is happening on the battlefield , in the opaque sphere of interpersonal violence ? Indeed , he tried to focus , to use one of his other expressions , on a ' history of flesh ' . He therefore did not hesitate to borrow , for instance , from zoology ( and its notions of ' flight distance ' and ' critical distance ' ) to explain human behaviour in attack and retreat during combat : the oft-recounted behaviour of Napoleon 's Imperial Guard at Waterloo , in its last charge against the unflinching British squares , is reinterpreted in this light . This is audacious . No need to add , of course , that Keegan never ' recounts ' a battle . He dissects it and pries open its mystery , meticulously describing different types of confrontation , as determined by the combatants ' weaponry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its violence is radically altered . In fact , his is n't a history of battle in the usual sense but an anthropology of combat . // Equally revealing of the great gulf that still exists between different approaches to history is the intellectual shock provoked by another study , the American classicist Victor Davis Hanson 's attempt to understand the violence peculiar to the clash of phalanxes in ancient Greece . To gain an understanding of classical infantry warfare , he did n't hesitate to burn grain , vines and olive trees in order to see in fact what the destruction of the territory of one Greek city state by another might mean , and to show its true significance in political , not just economic terms . Nor did he hesitate to make his students bear replicas of Greek weapons and armour in order to understand better the range of possibilities at the moment of a charge , to define some of the technical and physical predicaments more clearly . Then the ancient texts could be re-read in the harsh , if not cruel light of this experimentation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profess to be discussing war , are cut off from areas of relevant knowledge . Weapons , for example - how they are used , how they work , and what effect they have - are outside the competence of most of them , while military historians who may be learned about weaponry do n't know how to apply their knowledge . So one can not exaggerate the value of having at least some concrete knowledge of the instruments of violence ; tactile contact with them is not a superfluous historical experience . Objects lead to objections , as the etymology hints ; they stand in the way of the most established historical certitudes. // Taking the First World War as an example , we can see that familiarity with the infantrymen 's guns , with the truncheons and daggers used in the trenches that were manufactured according to the needs and requirements of combat , even touching and handling pieces of shrapnel , is just as essential as a close acquaintance with the terrain and a more than passing knowledge of battleground topography . Modern historians should not cut themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvaged in digs done during highway construction for example ) can contribute greatly to the knowledge of certain battle practices . A vast store of empirical knowledge is available for study and often within immediate grasp . // For instance , there is a highly specialised expertise ( which would merit historical studies of its own ) among military collectors and battlefield enthusiasts . But this generally reliable erudition , which has spawned journals , specialised books , meetings of devotees and networks of buyers and sellers - a very useful body of knowledge for professional historians , which they would be hard put to find elsewhere - is almost completely cut off from academic scholarship . This reaction on the part of scholarly ' historians stems from distrust , indeed denial , mixed with a touch of arrogance . With chilling humour , Keegan recounts how he once offended the curator of a war museum : // I constantly recall the look of disgust that passed over the face of a // highly distinguished curator of one of the greatest collections of // arms and armour in the world when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debris removed from the flesh of // wounded men by surgeons in the gunpowder age was broken // bone and teeth from neighbours in the ranks . He had simply // never considered what was the effect of the weapons about which // he knew so much , as artefacts , on the bodies of the soldiers who // used them . // But historians of war may be no more aware of these things than the curators of military museums . // Thresholds of violence in the Great War // Reticence in discussing violence is particularly unfortunate in the case of the Great War , for one important characteristic of this four-and-a-half-year conflict is its unprecedented levels of violence - among combatants , against prisoners and , last but not least , against civilians . To grasp these many-sided forms of violence is an indispensable prerequisite to any basic understanding of the 1914-18 conflict , and to any interpretation of the mark it left on the Western world . To understand the Great War is to try to understand that . We have to start with the fighting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , if indeed such an endeavour is possible , but simply to point out the salient factors . The Great War brought into being a new kind of armed confrontation and thus became a historical watershed , representing a complex rupture with the circumstances and conditions of warfare as they had been known before that had huge consequences for the rest of the century . // Already in 1914 , at the beginning of war , battle was much more violent than it had ever been before . And then military and civilian suffering gradually intensified the violence over the duration of the conflict . This progressive intensification lent its own dynamic to the conflict ; in the very first days and weeks of the war the practices of war took a brutal turn , not only on the battlefields but also for prisoners and civilians . Even for the ordinary soldier , the enormous explosion of violence that occurred in the summer of 1914 immediately and scathingly refuted all the predictions that had been made in the years prior . // The death toll of the Great War is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking at the total mobilisation figures , we find that the smaller nations were proportionally most affected , given the techniques of warfare used in the Balkans already in 1912-13 ; the treatment of the wounded and of prisoners , as well as the inadequacies of medical procedures , greatly contributed to the losses . ( Serbia lost 37 per cent of its soldiers , Turkey close to 27 per cent , Romania 25 per cent , Bulgaria 22 per cent . ) Among the great powers in the war , France holds the worst record in proportional losses : 16 per cent of its mobilised men were killed ( against 15.4 per cent for Germany ) . But late in the war not all the men who were mobilised actually fought . If we count only the French troops who were engaged in fighting , the proportionate losses are much greater : 22 per cent of the officers died and 18 per cent of the soldiers . In the infantry itself , the most exposed branch , one out of three officers was killed and one out of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
