APRIL 20 , 2001 Attorney and Client The client , like most clients , said he was innocent . He was scheduled to die in thirty-three days . Arthur Raven , his lawyer , was determined not to worry . After all , Arthur reasoned , he was not even a volunteer . Instead , he 'd been drafted by the federal appellate court to ensure that after ten years of litigation , no sound arguments remained to save Rommy Gandolph 's life . Worrying was not part of the job . He was worried anyway . " I 'm sorry ? " asked Pamela Towns , his young associate , from the passenger 's seat . A gurgle of anguish had escaped Arthur as he had come , once again , face-to-face with himself . " Nothing , " said Arthur . " I just hate being the designated loser . " " Then we should n't lose . " Pamela , with rosy good looks fit for TV news , flashed a bright coast-to-coast grin . They were far from the city now , doing eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In these parts , the road was so flat and straight , he did not even have to touch the wheel . The prairie farmlands raced by , corn stubble and loam , silent and eternal in the wan light of morning . They had left Center City at seven to beat the traffic . Arthur hoped to hold a brief introductory meeting with their new client , Rommy Gandolph , at the state penitentiary atRudyard and to be back at his desk by two o'clock - or three , if be decided to risk asking Pamela to lunch . He remained intensely conscious of the young woman nearby , of the tawny hair falling softly on her shoulders and of the hand that crept to her thigh every several miles to retract the hiking of her tartan skirt . Eager as he was to please her , Arthur could offer little hope for the case . " At this stage , " he said , " under the law , the only thing that could possibly amount to reversible error would be new evidence of actual innocence . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know ? " asked Pamela . " How do I know ? Because the man confessed to everybody but the Daily Planet . " Ten years ago , Gandolph had copped to the police , then gave a handwritten statement to the prosecutor , Muriel Wynn and finally repeated his admissions on videotape . On each occasion , he had acknowledged he was the person who 'd shot two men and a woman and left them in a restaurant food locker in a case still referred to , in the tempered words of the press , as ' the Fourth of July Massacre . ' " Well , he kept saying on the phone he 's innocent , " said Pamela . " It 's possible , is n't it ? " For Arthur , who had been a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney before coming to work seven years ago at O'Grady , Steinberg , Marconi and Horgan , there was no possibility of that at all . But Pamela , at twenty-five or twenty-six , had just started practice . Saving an innocent client was the sort of adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arc toward radiant justice . Instead , she 'd settled for a big law firm and $120,000 a year . But why not have everything ? Well , you could n't blame people for their fantasies . God knows , Arthur Raven realized that . " Listen to what I found in Rommy 's probation records , " said Pamela . " On July 5 , 1991 , he was sentenced to time served for a violation of probation . The murders were early on July 4th . So ' time served ' would mean he was in jail , would n't it ? " " It would mean he was in jail at some point . Not necessarily on July 4th . Does his rap sheet show he was in jail on July 4th ? " " No . But it 's something to investigate , is n't it ? " It would have been something to investigate a decade ago , when the records to prove it was nonsense still existed . Yet even at that , the federal appeals court was likely to grant Gandolph a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obliged to scramble in dogged - and futile - pursuit of this phantom theory . Rankled by the prospect of more wasted time , Arthur nudged the cruise control wand a bit higher and felt some dim satisfaction in the big auto 's response . He had purchased the car two months ago as a trophy of sorts after he became a full partner in his law firm . It was one of the few luxuries he 'd ever permitted himself , but he had barely turned the key when he began to feel he was disrespecting the memory of his father , who had recently passed , a loving man , but one whose eccentricities had included a cramped frugality . " And listen to this , " Pamela was saying . She had withdrawn Rommy Gandolph 's rap sheet from the thick folder on her lap and read out the entries . Gandolph was a thief and a fence . He 'd had half a dozen convictions - burglary , theft , possession of stolen property several times . " But nothing with a gun , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does he suddenly become a rapist and a murderer ? " " Practice , practice , practice , " answered Arthur . From the corner of his eye , he saw Pamela 's full mouth turn briefly downward . He was screwing this up . As always . Arthur did not know exactly what he had done wrong with women to leave him single at the age of thirty-eight . Appearance was one issue , he realized . He 'd had the droop and pallor of middle age since his teens . In law school , he 'd had a brief , hurtful marriage to Marjya , a Romanian immigrant . After that , for a period he 'd seemed to have neither the inclination nor the time to start again . He had given so much to the law - so much fury and passion in every case , so many nights and weekends where he actually felt pleasure in having solitary time to concentrate . And his father 's declining health , and the question of what would become of his sister , Susan , had also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faintest sign that Pamela had some interest in him , he felt humbled by his foolishness . His hopes with her were as unlikely as hers for Gandolph . He felt the need to chasten them both . " Look , " said Arthur , " our client , Gandolph . ' Rommy ' ? Not only did Rommy confess early and often , but when he went to trial , his defense was insanity . Which requires his lawyer to admit Rommy committed the crime . Then we have ten more years of appeals , and post-conviction petitions , and habeas corpus proceedings , with two different sets of new attorneys , and none of them happens to mention that Rommy is the wrong man . Let alone Rommy , who only remembered that he did n't do it when he was about forty-five days away from getting the needle . Really , Pamela . Do you think he told the lawyers before us he was innocent ? Every con knows this game - new lawyers , new story . " Arthur smiled , attempting to appear worldly-wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to criminal defendants ' shenanigans . Since leaving the Prosecuting Attorney 's Office , Arthur had played defense lawyer infrequently , only when one of the firm 's corporate clients or its bosses was suspected of some financial manipulation . The law he lived most days as a civil litigator was a tidier , happier law , where both sides fudged and the issues raised were minuscule matters of economic policy . His years as a prosecutor seemed to be a time when he 'd been assigned each day to clean out a flooded basement where coliform bacteria and sewer stink rotted almost everything . Someone had said that power corrupted . But the saying applied equally to evil . Evil corrupted . A single twisted act , some piece of gross psychopathology that went beyond the boundaries of what almost anybody else could envision - father who tossed his infant out a tenth-floor window ; a former student who forced lye down the throat of a teacher ; or someone like Arthur 's new client who not only killed but then sodomized one of the corpses - the backflow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosecutors . Defense lawyers . Judges . No one in the face of these horrors reacted with the dispassion the law supposed . There was a single lesson : things fall apart . Arthur had harbored no desire to return to that realm where chaos was always imminent . In another fifteen minutes they had arrived there . Rudyard was a small town like many others in the Middle West , its core a few dark buildings , still smudged with coal soot , and several tin hangars with corrugated plastic roofs that housed various farm services . At the outskirts , a kind of mini-suburbanization was under way , with strip malls and tract homes , the result of the economic security afforded by an unusual anchor industry - the prison . When they turned a corner on a movie-set neighborhood of maple trees and small frame houses , the facility suddenly loomed at the end of the block , like a horror-flick monster jumping out of a closet , a half-mile continuum of randomly connected yellow-brick buildings , notable for the narrowness of the few windows . Those structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have survived from the Middle Ages . Toward the perimeter lay not only a ten-foot brick wall , but a graveled moat of projecting stainless steel spikes , and beyond that a boundary of cyclone fencing supporting five-foot spirals of razor wire , brilliant in the sun . In the prison guardhouse , they signed in , then were directed to a worn bench for the long wait while Rommy was brought down . In the interval , Arthur reviewed Rommy 's letter , which had arrived via various intermediate hands at the Court of Appeals . It was composed in a hodgepodge scrawl , with multicolored markings and other features too irregular even to be called childish . Just looking at the letter , you knew that Rommy Gandolph was both desperate and crazy .
