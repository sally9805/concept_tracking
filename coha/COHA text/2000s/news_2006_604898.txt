<p> Rapper E-40 's raucous hit Tell Me When to Go , with Keak da Sneak , is giving the mainstream a glimpse of the Bay Area 's hyphy craze . The music , which is an even rowdier cousin to the South 's crunk , is part of a youth-oriented movement that has its own dances , slang , fashion and car culture . <p> The veteran rapper hopes the attention hyphy ( pronounced HIGH-fee ) is attracting will return the hip-hop spotlight to the influential but long-neglected Northern California region . <p> " It started out in Oakland and just spread through the Bay Area , " says E-40 ( Earl Stevens ) , whose recently released album , My Ghetto Report Card , was produced by crunk king Lil ' Jon . " The word hyphy itself means energetic or fired up or just doing the fool . It 's a stress reliever . The music makes the kids go silly , go bananas , go coconuts , go stupid . " <p> Going stupid can entail anything from frenzied dancing to doing donuts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and the speakers blaring . The movement is about letting go of inhibitions and having fun , and it takes some intense party music to incite its release . E-40 highlights the local kids ' typical spontaneous , frenzied wilding out in Tell Me 's black-and-white video as the song intones " tell me where to go ... Go dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb " over a thumping bass line . <p> Kids can go hyphy in clubs or in the streets or in long strings of cars , vans and campers , where they dance on the hoods and stand up through sunroofs to shake their dreadlocks . <p> Most of the elements of the hyphy movement were already present in the Bay Area before it was ever given a name . <p> Hyphy was originally neighborhood slang for uncontrolled anger , but eventually came to mean an unbridled release of energy . Keak da Sneak was the first rapper to use the term , on the song Cool from his 1998 album Sneakacidle . But it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the music really got its name and style . Since then , hyphy music has proliferated with such acts as Mistah F.A.B. , Messy Marv , Kin Smoke , Turf Talk , Droop-e and others , some of whom are now getting attention from major labels . <p> " We 've always been different out here , and that 's how the younger generation expresses themselves , " says Turf Talk , who burned up the local airwaves last year with The Slumper and is an in-demand guest rapper on other records . " That is what is making people pay attention to us because they are seeing how much energy and fun we 're having out here . " <p> Producer Droop-e , E-40 's 18-year-old son , who just released the album Fedi Fetcher and the Money Stretcher with B-Slimm , says the music " really has to do with the bass and how it hits you and what it makes you want to do . " Droop-e ( Earl Stevens Jr. ) , whose father surprised him with a home studio when he was 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rick Rock ( Ricardo Thomas ) , who has worked with the likes of Jay-Z , Busta Rhymes and Mariah Carey , says he recognized that kids were getting hyphy to almost any uptempo party music . He decided that it deserved its own unique sound . <p> " I told E-40 that they 'll go dumb to whatever  --  a Lil ' Jon song or anything  --  but this is ours , " he says . " It reflects our culture . Our demographic . It was like in the South , where they used to listen to everything . Then they found their own sound , and that 's what they listened to . We found ourselves , and we are going to go stupid to our own stuff and really feel proud about what we are doing . " <p> Allen Gordon , former chief editor of Rap Pages magazine and a longtime Bay Area resident , says the late Mac Dre ( who was gunned down in Kansas City in 2004 ) and his Thizz Entertainment camp were the first to pay attention to the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began catering to them at the shows and on records . Those activities had been going on for several years before coalescing into the hyphy movement . He says bass-driven productions such as Rick Rock 's , for example , are tailored to the head-snapping and high-speed foot and shoulder movements of hyphy dances . <p> " The Bay Area has always been known for dancing , " says Turf Talk , who is working with Rock and others on his upcoming album , West Coast Vaccine . " You might find the hardest gangsters out here dancing , because that 's in our blood . " <p> The music of the Bay Area has always reflected its independence from mainstream trends , whether it was the ' 60s R &B; of Sly &; the Family Stone or later , Tony Toni Tone , or its own brand of hip-hop , from Digital Underground onward . <p> E-40 says it has been more than a dozen years since Bay Area hip-hop has had so much attention . At that time , he and rappers such as Too Short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of records as independents . He says they originally created a street demand for their music and sold records out of the trunks of their cars . <p> " We 've always been hustlers and I 'm not speaking about illegal hustlers , " says E-40 . " We know how to make a way out of no way . Too Short is the godfather and I 'm like the ambassador . " <p> But despite some individual success , the region 's rappers never exploded in the mainstream the way those from other cities did . E-40 says Master P , for example , took the lessons he learned while living in Richmond , Calif. , and built his No Limit empire in his native New Orleans . <p> " Every record label was getting at us at that time , but we fumbled the ball , " says E-40 , whose My Ghetto Report Card entered the Billboard album chart at No. 3 in March . " I hung on like a hubcap in the fast lane along with a few other rappers , and now it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to other regions and were bypassing us like the surgery out here . But we 're trendsetters , and the rap game without the Bay Area is like old folks without bingo . " <p> The region is responsible for much of hip-hop 's lingo , though it does n't always get credit for it . E-40 , who is legendary for his use and creation of slang ( e.g. , " fa sheezy " and " fa shizzle , " " collar poppin ' , " " it 's all gravy , " " what 's up pimpin ' "  --  see sidebar ) , is working on E-40 's Dictionary Book of Slang , Vol. 1 to put it all in one place . <p> " I was hesitant to do it for many years because I did n't know if I was going to be giving too much game up , " says E-40 , who is also producing a Hype on Hyphy DVD . " If I got paid for every word that I put out there in the air where it 's fair , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the game now . I 'm not mad at them . We 're just innovators . " <p> At the moment , E-40 is as hot as he has ever been . His album is out on Lil ' Jon 's Warner Bros. - affiliated BME imprint , and his second single , U and Dat , with T-Pain and Kandi Girl , is already headed up the charts . He says he had known Lil ' Jon for years through their mutual friendship with Too Short . E-40 had several offers for a new record label deal after his 10-year stay at Jive Records ended , and felt that signing with Lil ' Jon was the best fit . <p> " I knew he could hyphy because people in the Bay would dance off his music when it does n't even say anything about hyphy , " he says . <p> Meanwhile , he 's featured along with Sean Paul of The Youngbloodz on Lil ' Jon 's new hit , Snap Yo ' Fingers . <p> " I 'm a part of two movements now , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been popularized by Dem Franchize Boyz and D4L . <p> Gordon says that E-40 's My Ghetto Report Card has given hyphy a boost , but whether it will become a lasting trend remains to be seen . <p> " It was a great album and it might send some eyes this way to see who else is out here , " Gordon says . " You 'll probably see a lot of artists now have hyphy songs on their albums . " <p> Rock , who 's producing The Federation 's upcoming album , It 's Whatever , which is due on Warner Bros. this summer , says Bay Area artists can win mainstream appeal beyond the hyphy movement . The key , he feels , is putting out good music , similar to what happened in the South , which has produced a slew of mainstream artists in recent years . <p> " Look at a group like Outkast , " he says . " That 's a group that 's going to be there , because they broke the chain of just being a regional group . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . If we can do nice , big records and not just hyphy records , we will do well . " PHOTO , Color , Martin E. Klimek for USA TODAY PHOTO , B/W , Martin E. Klimek for USA TODAY PHOTO , B/W , Martin E.
