The last time an American president made war on Iraq , he gathered his aides together and quietly told them what to do . He dispatched some on secret missions to round up cash from rich countries without armies , others to nail down overflight rights from nations that preferred to sit on the fence . He saw to the freezing of Iraqi assets and the movement of U.S. warships , troops and planes  --  and when they were in position , he mounted a worldwide diplomatic push for war . Only later did he let the public in on the details . Even some of George H.W. Bush 's best friends later admitted that they could n't really believe he 'd pulled it off . <P> But now that another Bush Administration is packing for a trip to Baghdad , the son 's method in no way resembles the father 's . For President George W. Bush 's team is n't so much preparing for war with Iraq as it is fighting a war with itself about whether and how to fight . The battle is oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq this time but the front pages of various newspapers  --  is strewn with bickering Bush aides and unnamed generals . Amid all the leaking and counterleaking , Bush 's own comments about his aims keep shifting  --  which may explain why those of everyone around him do too . <P> Sometime last spring the President ordered the Pentagon and the CIA to come up with a new plan to invade Iraq and topple its leader . He feared that Saddam was developing weapons of mass destruction and might link up with remnants of al-Qaeda for another attack on America . At first , the timetable called for action this fall , but then the Middle East exploded , India and Pakistan started to rumble , and Afghanistan slid toward chaos again  --  all of which helped push back the expected mobilization until at least early next year . And now that the U.S. economy seems to be downshifting again , Iraq may have to wait  --  some think forever . As a top official from one Middle East ally put it last week , " Iraq is over . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warriors from skirmishing . It began in April , when Pentagon sources leaked word to the New York Times that an Iraqi war would require as many as 250,000 troops . That was standard procedure  --  warning the White House and Congress that a march to Baghdad would mean more casualties than they realized . It was also a signal . Says a former service Secretary : " The generals do n't want to put kids in harm 's way for what they think is a fool 's errand . " <P> That led to a second wave of leaks from various factions proposing cheaper , safer alternatives : Air Force and Special Operations teams wanted an Afghanistan-style operation , with commandos and bombers coordinating ( in theory , anyway ) with Iraqi opposition groups . That approach had backing from key officials , notably Wayne Downing , a retired Army general in charge of coordinating the war on terrorism . The Central Command chief , Army General Tommy Franks , rejected it because he believes the opposition is n't up to the job . " There are 24 divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time . " There 's a limit to how much you can do with guys on horseback and B-52s . " Not long after Downing 's plan fell out of favor , he announced he was leaving the government .
