The Glimmer brothers are old-time jazzmen , long estranged . Martin ( John Spencer ) has kept faith with the music  --  and with self-destruction . Daniel ( Nicolas Surovy ) has settled for suburban prosperity and forgetfulness . Shine ( Jonathan Silverman ) , the son of a man who played with them , effects a reconciliation while pursuing Daniel 's daughter ( Alexa Fischer ) . Leight won a Tony for Side Man , also about musical lives . This play , now at Los Angeles ' Mark Taper Forum , is slicker , more manipulative . It is saved by Spencer ( of TV 's West Wing ) , whose towering rage at the dying light is awesome and hilarious . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
