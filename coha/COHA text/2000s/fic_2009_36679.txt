What was good about the road was that the road 's decisions were already made . For two full days I 'd watched it emerge on the horizon and disappear beneath me . I saw it change colors , from black to gray to brown , and sometimes felt the seams between them , a clunk against the steady tremble . Los Angeles giving way to glittery Vegas , Martian Utah , and a blind nighttime passage through the Rockies . Then a fresh morning of eastern Colorado fading into prodigious fields of Kansan wheat , forever-sized and flat like nothing you 've ever seen , until finally Missouri , blunt and dark , a series of brake lights to guide along the final leg . I surrendered to the road . Only once did I pick up my phone and call Audrey . After eight rings I heard her voice mail , and here I likely should have made some gesture , but everything had already been said , repeated , thrown around like rolled-up socks . <br> Then I was back in the driveway , engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . There was a new addition to the house jutting into what used to be side yard . I could imagine my parents in the living room , quiet and mostly still , cozy within that special silence of the long-married . If I unfastened my seat belt , the car would beep at me . <br> Soon enough the front door opened to reveal parents silhouetted against the yellow glow of home . I cut the engine , stepped into the night , raised a hand , and smiled . Hello . The air felt and tasted heavy and wet . A hug , a hand pressed flush against cheek , and even though it was n't a week since we 'd all been together at commencement , I sensed relief in them both . During her second hug my mother swayed and spoke quietly to the air , our boy , our boy , our boy . <br> <br> " Makes more sense to unload now , " my father said . " Twice the hands . " <br> She said to make a pile of laundry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you hungry ? I 've got salami . " <br> Car unloaded , shoes off , I sat on the counter above the dishwasher and chewed a sandwich . My parents watched . I always needed this , when they would stand as a pair , sharing the same frame . These are my parents , these two adults . I am their only remaining child . My brother , Fredrick Alan Mays , drowned at the age of five when he chased his rubber four square ball into the leaf- and tarpaulin-covered swimming pool at the Sheldon Woods apartment complex . At the time my mother was spoon-feeding a ten-month-old me special prescription formula . My father was at work , making his way through a small mountain of legal briefs . There were no witnesses . Freddy falling onto an ancient , heavy tarp improperly anchored to the pool 's deck and becoming entangled , sinking beneath fetid off-season water while my mother ensured I was taking to the new formula . One splash , then many more as his arms flailed , little puddles on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment of active deliberation : I was their son who did n't drown . To their credit , my parents understood . They remained side by side and gave me a second . <br> " Our boy , " Carla said , beaming as she wrapped up the rolls and the meat . <br> I could see my father preparing to talk . He was examining his hands , pulling his frame slightly inward , revving . Richard stood over six foot and was handsome the way people found reassuring . His hair , full and gray , embraced age without submitting to it . I watched him shrug slowly and look up from his hands . <br> " How 's the car running ? " <br> " It 's a great car , " I said . " I love the car . Thank you guys , again , for the car . " <br> " Be sure to check the oil tomorrow . You know how to check <br> the oil ? " <br> " Of course , Pop . " <br> " Of course you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check tomorrow . And then what else ? Is there a plan ? You check the oil and I 'll poke around if you like , find something for you . Not to say hurry up and decide . Not to pressure . Your mother and I are just glad to have you around for a while . Are n't we , Carla ? But will it hurt to start thinking about things ? No it wo n't . History of the world , nobody 's ever died from giving a little thought . Not a single bruise caused by thinking things over . Really : we 're just glad to have you back . Wait  --  I 'm in Cleveland this week . Back on Thursday . Poke around then . " <br> I smiled and he seemed to smile kind of , and this was good , <br> then he nodded and looked back at his hands . <br> My mother moved to my father 's side . " The important thing is there 's food here whenever you want it . Chicken wings , toasted ravioli , twice-baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second floor . I stepped into the newly redecorated bathroom and watched myself brush teeth , then spent minutes leaning onto the sink , examining my reflection . In the bedroom , I opened and closed the wardrobe and several dresser drawers . I was continually impressed by the sturdiness of my parents ' furniture , dark old wood that hinted at permanence . My poster of Ozzie Smith mid-dive hung over my bed and my sheets smelled of some theoretical sunny and breezy afternoon , the middle of a field . I lay down , closed my eyes , and breathed . Sleep , lately , was becoming an issue . <br> Some time later , I tossed back sheets and stood . Downstairs , I moved from one room to the next , turning corners with soft steps . Every few years my parents would hire crews of men to come and hang sheets of translucent plastic , rip up floorboards , and push walls outward . Two years ago they furnished the basement . Before that they lengthened the patio into the backyard , then they added the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once been the family room . I stood where the current living room used to end and looked into the most recent addition . The office , Richard called it . The computer room , Carla called it . I touched picture frames and ran fingers across new plaster . I leaned against the enormous desk and waited . <br> A timer made the rooms go even darker than before . <br> Back upstairs , the house grew colder and I crawled deeper into the bedding so that soon only my face was exposed . I may have been acting like a child , but in this room it was sanctioned . It was okay . <br> Audrey was on an airplane . Or she 'd already landed . <br> Where was it . Paris . <br> There was noise directly above me , the scraping of some creature in the attic . Plural creatures . From inside the fabric-softened and spring-breezy cocoon I watched shadows of branches dance across the wall . Rain . <br> Breakfast was two eggs fried into the middle of hollowed-out pieces of toast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disappeared , then came back to write onto a Post-it she stuck to the phone . <br> " I think there might be squirrels in the attic , " I said . <br> " Squirrels ? " <br> Before retiring , my mother had been a universally loved <br> second-grade teacher . She won annual awards and was showered with Christmas gifts by the parents of her students . It took very little effort to imagine her leading a class . That short , wavy brown teacher hair , the full-length single-color dresses , flats  --  her whole package was perfectly educational , a surplus of maternal energy . <br> " We just had a man here for bees . And now squirrels ? " <br> When she retired , much of that teacherly vigor was diverted <br> into her garden . In the fall she disposed of annuals and cut back perennials , covered soil with manure as one would ice a cake . She spent entire springs on her knees , dual wristbands to wipe away full days of sweat . It was her passion , basic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cash ? " <br> " Me ? Fine . I 'm fine . " <br> She left the kitchen and returned a few minutes later in her sleeveless shirt and denim shorts . Her purse was under the phone . She pulled out her wallet and removed an uncreased bill . She laid the bill next to my orange juice , kissed my forehead , and stepped through the side door into her garden . I walked immediately to the phone and called Stuart Hurst . <br> " This is Stuart . " <br> " Stubes . So formal . " <br> " Potter Mays ! Home again home again . Jiggedy jigg . " <br> " I 'm working on two hours ' sleep and would like to get out of my house . " <br> " Makes sense . Incidentally , this was my last night in the pool house . I 'm out : onward , forward . I 'll come pick you up and we 'll drive over to the new place . Sneak peek before tonight 's welcoming event . You just wait right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the apartment complex and its pool behind , moving into the desirable Ladue public school district . That first day of third grade , stepping onto a morning bus full of boys and girls I had never seen , and among all of the eyes sat Stuart the fourth grader , waving me over to his rubberized seat . <br> " Lookit , " he said , opening his palm to reveal a small brick of staples . He picked one off from the rest , put it onto his tongue , and swallowed . " One at a time , they go down easy . Try . " <br> I sat on the front porch and waited . The pool house in his parents ' backyard was n't more than ten minutes ' drive , plus whatever time it took to overcome his immense personal inertia . I stood and walked circles through the grass of the front lawn , my head poring over the idea of distance : the mile , a single clean figure that broke down into a mess , those five thousand two eighty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass beneath my shoes . Audrey deemed it a terrible waste to not go shoeless whenever she could , and her feet were callused and tough for it . Then one afternoon last spring , as I was packing the car for a camping trip with friends , mine , her right foot found a stray nail hiding in some grass , and I spent the afternoon wrapping her foot , touching her hair , driving to the emergency room , and waiting for a tetanus shot because she could n't remember ever having one , placing lips to her hand as the needle entered , laughing as she limped back to the car . Saying of course . Saying you 're welcome . All the while the resentment building , growing , this beady-eyed and sharp-toothed troll of resentment making home in my stomach . Delirious wonder if maybe she 'd found the nail on purpose , that it was all secretly on purpose . Resentment as appalling as it was amazing , a sheer force I had no choice but to embrace . I moved from grass onto driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past four years and meaning it every time as far as I knew . Her flight went Portland to O'Hare to London Heathrow to Charles de Gaulle . Three weeks . <br> Finally I saw him . Despite limitless wealth , Stuart continued to drive the first car his parents bought him , a mid-nineties Ford Explorer variously dented and run-down . He viewed himself as the unique product of convergent psychocapitalist forces , so driving his big dumb American truck car until it died was a way to both honor these forces and assert his individuality . When I opened the door , he was nodding and not smiling . <br> " And so begins what might be the worst year of your life . " <br> " Start simple , please , and tell me how , " I said . <br> " Ca n't , " he said . " Your version wo n't be anything like mine . What do you know about Cambodia ? Do n't get me wrong , this is going to be difficult . I promise . But not Cambodia . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight from the baggage claim to his parents ' pool house for a swim and a beer . Weeks passed and he decided he might as well live there and avoid the potential explosions with his father and stepmother at the main house . And so he stayed . He inhabited the pool house as if it were some sort of womb , subsisting on the runoff luxury that trickled from John and Deanna Hurst 's massive home . Details of his year were sparse . He admitted to devoting a fair chunk of his time to open-ended thought , and he also mentioned blowing the occasional line of Talkative . <br> " Situations came up . " Stuart rolled through a stop sign . " Some of them involved women who wo n't enter a room unless there 's Talkative inside . " <br> Now Stuart had found an apartment . I knew this because he had sent me a series of e-mails . I knew the building dated from the turn of the last century , and was gorgeous , and classy , and likely about the most amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodwork , floors that would creak under our feet . Old Cardinals pennants hanging on the walls of his first personal home . <br> We drove into downtown Clayton , a mixture of ten-story office buildings and overpriced restaurants . Women in unrevealing skirts stood with jacketless men on street corners , not exactly smiling . The storm that I listened to all night had dropped leaves and small branches from the trees that lined these streets , great bodies of green flirting with squat glass towers . I was always shocked when I returned from LA to find so much color , like some regional dTtente with nature . <br> " How are those allergies ? " Stuart asked . <br> " Allergies , " I said . " I forgot all about my allergies . " <br> We 'd come for housewarming supplies . He parked us between two silver luxury SUVs . The plaque on the wall said : STRAUB 'S MARKET : FINE GROCERS SINCE 1901 . Whatever sort of place it was back then , what we stepped into was a boutique market where local families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping carts and grated chrome shelves . <br> Stuart picked a jar of apricot mango wasabi sauce . " I 'm guessing things did n't end well with Audrey . " <br> " At some point a guess stops being a guess . " <br> " You look horrible , " he said . " What went wrong ? " <br> " Every possible thing went wrong . It was a sequence of mistakes based on various kinds of selfishness . I stand by some of my actions . Other actions I can hardly believe were mine . Remember our plan to travel after graduation ? Instead , she 's in Europe with Carmel for three weeks and I 'm here . " <br> " So this is punishment , " he said . <br> " Yes . Because I am a selfish asshole prick man . " <br> We moved to the meat counter , a thing of local legend . Two goateed men wearing white aprons eyed us suspiciously until Stuart ordered eight flank steaks and four pork loins . <br> " I think you 're going to appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few recent projects are investment-worthy if I can find the right people . " <br> It was generally assumed Stuart would work for his father , but nobody had the foggiest notion when he 'd start . Two months earlier , at school , I 'd received an envelope with a business card tucked inside : <br> <br> Stuart Hurst <br> Mentation , Ideation , Formulation , <br> and Innovation Specialist <br> AND <br> Independent Thought Contractor <br> " Bringing tomorrow 's ideas to the forefront of today 's late afternoon . " <br> Mentation as employment , research in its loosest , most wandering sense . No specific hours as such , only the faith that every so often he 'd stumble upon a worthwhile thought . <br> The store 's stereo played a Bach fugue . A woman with a green basket over her arm sneezed , and at least three voices blessed her . How many of these women had had face-lifts ? It was impossible for me to know . Audrey came from a family of surgeons , which meant she could tell without fail who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips from campus into Hollywood to stroll Melrose and pretend to window-shop . <br> " Look at her neck , " she 'd explain in that voice of hers . " Necks do n't lie . Also notice she does n't have earlobes . " <br> I carried as much Budweiser as I could and met Stuart at the checkout lane . Now the old woman in the forest-green apron eyed me suspiciously . Childish features still intact , my face round , nose , I suppose , buttonlike , I must have looked a little like every grandson in the entire world , because old women were always finding me charming . This one did not . I handed her my driver 's license . <br> Our total was a little over three hundred dollars . Because he was missing the index finger on his right hand , Stuart 's pen grip was always awkward and comical , but now what came out was a fantastic signature , sinuous letters curling into themselves with much flourish . This was new . <br> The apartment was in the Central West End @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city was afraid to go there . Lining the highway were commercial developments I 'd never seen before . Soon we came to the bridge of the Science Center , where kids on field trips aimed speedometers at traffic . The whole highway moved at a cautious fifty-eight . Once we exited , Stuart made a series of rapid turns and I lost all sense of direction , all I could see were houses and trees , trees everywhere , until he came to a stop where a fire truck and several police cruisers blocked the road . <br> " Well . " He flicked his cigarette to the ground . " How 's this for something . " <br> I followed a few steps behind . The visuals were powerful  --  spinning lights , various troops of personnel moving across the scene , a thin crowd of gawking onlookers . At the center of it all was a building , its top quarter collapsed by the tree that had fallen into it . I had been awake for much of the storm that moved through during the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind a force . And now here was this tree at this awkward angle , the rubble of fallen brick , a barbarous act of partial destruction . <br> I heard shouting and the clunk of boots on pavement . The firemen leaned against their truck and watched . Stuart remained calm , so I tried to remain calm . I took turns looking at Stuart and looking at where the tree had fallen through the apartment . His arms were crossed at his chest . <br> " Looks like no other apartments were damaged , " he said . <br> " That 's the apartment . The e-mail . " <br> " Look close and you can see my red couch in there . See it ? Totally great couch . " <br> Imagine the sound of a tree severing from itself and falling through a building . Thunderous crack of wood followed soon by crash of brick and plaster and more wood . At ground level , the stump and about six feet of splintered tree remained , doomed . What was this ? Surely wind alone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " Those firemen look bored as hell , " he said . <br> I looked at the crowd of onlookers . Were these walkers who had just happened upon this disaster ? Several were talking into phones . It would be a hard scene to leave once you stumbled upon it ; a tree falls in the city and select few are there to look . There would be the natural urge to describe it all to some friend or family member , dial a random number and share with whoever answered . To describe was to make real ; listen to what I 'm seeing . You 'll never believe what I saw . I used to say girlfriend and find reassurance , a word to frame that corner of my world . <br> I overheard the man next to me speaking of a particular fungus . Dutch elm , he said , then again to someone else . Dutch elm . I shared the fungus theory with Stuart , speaking out of the corner of my mouth as if delivering a grave national secret . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " <br> Here was actual trial , and Stuart was handling it like a weathered veteran . Was it really only one year between us ? Though I had friends in my class through school , baseball teammates and the normal balance of sundry peers , there was something to having a friend a year older . He was a guide of sorts to whatever was to come in year X + 1 , a role I knew he relished . Now he was composed , stoic in the face of immense loss . With this and the signature , I felt honored to be standing so close to him . <br> " I wonder who you 're supposed to tell . The firemen ? They 'll point you in the right direction , at least . Get the insurance agent out here . " <br> " I got a car full of meat , Potter . Let 's go back to the pool house . " <br> We walked back to the car and climbed inside . I adjusted the air-conditioning onto my face and watched the spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what to say . <br> " I do n't know what to say . Look at you . You 're a rock . " <br> Now , backtracking along the route we 'd taken earlier , I felt the first bored pangs of recognition . There was the park . The Science Center . Fifty-eight miles per hour . <br> " I would sure like some response here . " <br> " My apartment has been demolished by a mixed act of nature and insidious vermin . Fine . You want me to talk about it , and I would n't mind talking about it , but I am not someone who can complain . " <br> " You ca n't complain . But even that is a kind of complaint . " <br> " You and I do n't live in Cambodia . There are n't land mines in our backyards that could blow off our limbs every time we go out for a jog . " <br> This was my best friend , driving the Ford . Look at him , I thought . Look and absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the resources I had in the world , all the unfairly distributed and crapshoot gifts I 'd been blessed with , perhaps Stuart Hurst would prove the most valuable . Because the basic truth was that I had a decision to make , one I had put off for as long as I possibly could because I did n't have the proper tools . Or , rather , I had too many tools and no concept of how to use them . I needed considerable help . <br> " I want to contract some thought . " <br> " I know just the guy , " Stuart said . <br> " I owe it to her and I owe it to myself . I have three weeks . Three weeks to devote to nothing but deciding whether I 'm actually in matter of serious fact in love with her . I ask myself all the time : are you in love with her ? And I answer . I say the word and I believe the word , but then at the same time I hear the word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stuart said . " Are you in love with Audrey ? " <br> " Yes , " I said . <br> " I see what you mean . " He considered this for a mile . " Realize I have to charge you . We 're not playing kickball here . This is what I do professionally . The more serious I take what I do , the better I end up doing it . " <br> " Maybe part of the question is answered by the fact that I 'm looking for third-party help , " I said . " Maybe that 's data for you to add to the pile . " <br> " Maybe , " he said . <br> " I used to be an emotionally rich young male , Stubes . Now I 'm like , what 's the cardboard . Manila . " <br> " This sounds like the sort of thing where I work at my own pace until I reach a conclusion and then charge you retroactively . Meaning there will have to be a certain level of trust between us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , client . But I will charge you . Break , sure . Discount , sure . Free lunch , no . " <br> We passed our old middle school , the Ladue fire department , the Amoco station where I 'd once seen two hockey players kick and tear at each other until the ground was covered in blood and flannel and khaki . Audrey had questioned what I wanted . We had entire conversations about what we might each possibly want . Over time it became clear that what she knew of desire was far greater than the filaments I had at my disposal . And this , among so many other things , had led to profound loss of sleep . <br> " We will of course still throw a party , " he said . " Call it a Welcome Back , Potter party . " <br> I sneezed twice , then let my head fall against the window . <br> " You expect there to be women at this party ? Talkative ? " <br> " Damn yes , " he said . " Research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
