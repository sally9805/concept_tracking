Section : Article High-temperature superconductivity makes a bid for the power grid <p> In 1986 , scientists discovered a new family of materials that can conduct electricity with absolutely no resistance . Because these so-called superconductors work at much higher temperatures than any previously identified superconductors , the discovery was considered one of the most important of that decade . The findings triggered a wave of euphoria that flooded scientific meetings and the popular press . <p> At an American Physical Society meeting in New York City that convened just months after the discovery hit the news , thousands of researchers overflowed a huge hall . An all-night session was filled with presentations about the phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity and speculations about its impact . That event became known as the Woodstock of physics . <p> Because the materials potentially could carry huge currents resistance-free and because cooling them to their effective temperature is far less onerous a task than it is for their lower-temperature cousins , many scientists turned visionary and predicted a technological revolution . <p> " We physicists were the darlings of the media for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) in Palo Alto , Calif . At the time , he led the research group at IBM 's Almaden Research Center in San Jose , Calif. , that determined the atomic structure of one of the materials . " If someone shoves a mike in your face . . . you can say some things that , in retrospect , are pretty silly , " he says . <p> To be sure , the revolution has yet to materialize , mainly because the new substances-complex and brittle ceramics-proved to be tougher to tame than the early pundits suspected . But the dream did n't die . <p> Recently , researchers and designers have started demonstrating full-scale prototypes of electric power cables , motors , transformers , and other equipment made of high-temperature superconducting ( HTS ) wire . The new devices waste less energy than their conventional counterparts . The energy requirement is less even when taking into account the power to cool them to - 196degreesC  --  or often lower temperatures when strong magnetic fields are present . Moreover , the new superconducting equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmentally friendly than conventional devices . <p> " We 're offering a way to make motors and other electrical equipment as perfect as they 're ever going to get , " says James Daley , manager of the Department of Energy 's ( DOE ) superconductivity program , which is based in Washington , D.C. <p> In Detroit next year , if all goes well on one of the projects sponsored by Daley 's office , power will flow through HTS cables to commercial customers for the first time . <p> The main component of the HTS devices now beginning to prove themselves is wire made with compounds of bismuth , strontium , calcium , copper , and oxygen . These matericals are generically known as BSCCO ( pronounced bisco ) . <p> However , the high cost of using BSCCO looms as a serious obstacle to its wide use . That cost may come down through high-volume production of the wire and improvements in its performance . Still , even BSCCO manufacturers are looking for less expensive alternatives to the material . <p> In labs throughout the world , researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yttrium barium copper oxide , or YBCO ( pronounced ibco ) . YBCO wires may cost less than BSCCO ones . They 're also expected to carry higher currents than BSCCO wires in the presence of the magnetic fields found in many types of equipment . <p> If YBCO wire can be made in practical lengths-a challenge that arose as soon as YBCO was discovered in 1987-high-temperature superconductivity may finally offer both cost low enough and performance high enough to become a central technology of the 21st century , say many industry observers . " It 's a big leap of faith to go to YBCO , " notes Donald U. Gubser of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , D.C. But it 's a leap that " could lead to tremendous rewards , " he adds . <p> By ordinary human scales of hot and cold , there 's nothing really high temperature about high-temperature superconductors . As the materials are cooled from ambient temperature , their superconductivity kicks in at so-called critical temperatures . But those temperatures are high only in comparison with the critical temperatures of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals or metal alloys , lose all resistivity when chilled to a temperature that liquefies helium , which is - 269degreesC . By contrast , the critical temperatures of high-temperature superconductors tend to be above - 196degreesC , the temperature at which nitrogen liquifies . That 's still profoundly cold , but it 's much less of a challenge for refrigeration systems to meet . <p> Building practical power devices with high-temperature superconductors entailed making them into a suitable wire . That took more than a decade , but finally developers figured out ways to reliably encase the granular , brittle BSCCO in silver and extrude the package into long filaments . <p> Further rolling and heating coerces the material , on a microscopic level , to align in a manner that permits large currents to flow . The technique , which researchers developed by about 1990 , works because BSCCO crystals have a layered structure- " like a deck of cards , " says Gregory J. Yurek , a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology metallurgist who co-invented the idea of blending BSCCO with metal . He 's now president of HTS-wire maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolling shatters the weak bonds between the cardlike flakes of BSCCO , spreading each deck lengthwise by sliding layers past each other . Heating then merges overlapping flakes , creating an extended , continuous path along which current can flow . <p> Even with this wire-making tactic in hand , there was still a long slog ahead to practical applications . " A lot of hard work has gone into fine-tuning the process incrementally so today you have wire with high enough performance , " EPRI 's Grant notes . At present , the maximum amount of current per cross-sectional area , or critical current density , of BSCCO  --  roughly 70,000 amperes per square centimeter ( A/cm2 ) at - 196degreesC  --  is about three times what it was 4 years ago , he says . Above the critical current density , a superconducting wire starts to resist electric flow . <p> Because BSCCO wires are made only partially of the pure superconducting material , the actual critical current density of wires reaches only about 15,000 A/cm2 . Nonetheless , that 's 15 to 150 times copper 's maximum current density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other device containing the metal can dissipate heat . <p> Because of their high capacity , HTS cables can be so svelte that Detroit 's local electric utility , in partnership with DOE and other institutions , is replacing nine underground , oil-cooled copper power cables that serve nearly 14,000 customers with just three liquid-nitrogen-cooled BSCCO cables . By next summer , when the swap should be complete , a mere 900 pounds of BSCCO wire will have taken the place of 25,000 lbs . of copper wire . <p> DOE estimates that because of electrical resistance and other losses , more than 7 percent of all the power currently generated in the United States is wasted . By converting the nation 's power grid to HTS technology , " we can save half the existing losses , " Daley claims . <p> Last July , in a milestone for practical high-temperature superconductivity , another DOE project led by Rockwell Automation in Greenville , S.C. , began to test the first HTS motor powerful enough to potentially find wide use in industry . According to DOE , motors rated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent  --  of U.S. electric power . The prototype 1,000-horsepower , BSCCO-based motor is currently half the size and weight of a conventional motor but shows about the same efficiency . However , its developers say that they expect to slice its energy losses in half . <p> Meanwhile , the same consortium is building a 5,000-horsepower motor . And the U. S. Navy has been exploring the possibility of 25,000-33,000-horsepower HTS motors to drive all-electric ships . " **31;1232;TOOLONG motors exist today , but they 're so big and heavy that ships do n't use them , " Gubser notes . An HTS motor of that power would tip the scales at about 40,000 lbs. , a third the weight of a conventional motor , he estimates . <p> The green potential of HTS devices is soon to be put to the test by Waukesha ( Wisc . ) Electric , DOE , and their partners . Early next year , they expect to install a large , BSCCO-based transformer at a utility substation . Because of their low temperatures , HTS transformers do n't require the hazardous oils that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain toxic , flame-retarding compounds called PCBs , sometimes leak into the ground , Daley says . By eliminating the oils , HTS transformers and power cables offer an environment-protection bonus over conventional technology , Daley notes . Moreover , the new transformers could be used in buildings where conventional transformers have been banned because of the risk that their cooling oils will catch fire . <p> Despite the apparent advantages of high-temperature superconductors , major economic and technical hurdles remain as engineers push the new materials toward the power grid . <p> BSCCO is costly because it 's encased in silver . Currently , BSCCO wire costs 20 to 30 times as much as copper wire does . However , a number of superconductivity veterans predict the price will drop to a tenth of today 's figure within the next 3 to 5 years , as long as the predicted demand for HTS cables and devices materializes . <p> Contributing to that anticipated price drop , supply should also increase dramatically because American Superconductor is building the first large-scale plant for making the wire . By 2002 , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . " We expect the cost of production to fall by about a factor of six when we open that plant , " says company spokesman John B. Howe . <p> As BSCCO becomes more abundant , its quality is also likely to continue to improve , Gubser says , so the cost of making devices from the wire may diminish . <p> In the meantime , wire researchers are lavishing most of their funding and laboratory studies on what they hope will be BSCCO 's successor  --  YBCO . " People believe that YBCO wire can be manufactured with significantly lower cost " than BSCCO wire , Gubser says . <p> That 's because scientists have found ways to make YBCO wire by starting with a strip of inexpensive metal such as nickel . The researchers then coat the strip with a few layers of materials that keep the metal atoms from contaminating the superconductor , and they finally add a thin YBCO topcoat . <p> Because YBCO has a high critical current density , that last layer can be extremely thin but still enable the wire to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Researchers have measured up to 3 million A/cm2 in some YBCO wire samples at - 196degreesC , says David C. Larbalestier of the University of Wisconsin-Madison . That 's more than 40 times the critical current density of BSCCO ( SN : 4/29/95 , p. 269 ) . <p> Yet making YBCO wire is more easily said than done . So far , no one has found a way to fabricate it in practical lengths . The challenge has been to get the YBCO , which lacks the laminar structure of BSCCO , to lie down in a uniform sheet that has crystal lattices lined up nearly perfectly in three dimensions from one grain to the next . <p> Why must grain boundaries line up so well ? Think of superconductivity as a flow of pairs of electrons , called Cooper pairs , says Oak Ridge ( Tenn . ) National Laboratory physicist John D. Budai ( SN : 2/11/95 , p. 88 ; 6/7/97 , p. 351 ) . Those electrons " have to dance around each other in a careful way so as to never run into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade ago developed one of the main ways of aligning YBCO films . " They ca n't keep doing that when they hit the boundary between two misaligned grains " because there the atomic layout abruptly changes , he says . <p> By using very expensive fabrication techniques , researchers can now align their YBCO grains to within a 10degrees angle of each other , which allows for adequate currents-but only up to a half-dozen meters . Beyond that , irregularities still wreck the wire 's properties . <p> Interestingly , a sprinkle of calcium where the grains touch could be a solution . In an experiment on just two grains meeting at a 24degree angle , Jochen Mannhart of the University of Augsburg in Germany and his colleagues found that a dose of calcium could boost current through the intersection sixfold . The calcium may directly modify the border , researchers suspect . Also , because there 's a shortage of electrons in calcium ions compared with the yttrium ions that they displace , the calcium effectively injects additional positive charges that can ferry current across the boundary region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATURE . <p> In a commentary accompanying that report , Grant calls this calcium doping " the best idea that 's come along in the 5 years since coated conductors first emerged . " <p> Yurek says that he doubts such doping will benefit YBCO films because the grains are already much better aligned than those in the German experiment . Budai and Daley also doubt that added calcium is necessary for practical wire-making . <p> While such uncertainties surrounding YBCO continue to challenge research scientists and engineers , the demonstrations of BSCCO-based devices are convincing utilities and industry that HTS technology works and is reliable . Says Larbalestier , " Technically , the picture is clear . Those things work . " <p> That should make it easier for YBCO-based technology , if and when it becomes ready , to take over what BSCCO has begun . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Four wire strips made of the high-temperature superconductor BSCCO ( foreground ) can carry as much current as a copper cable about 100 times larger in cross-sectional area . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Workers assemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant in Cleveland . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : **32;1265;TOOLONG motors may propel proposed all-electric U.S. Navy ships .
