1 December 22 , 2005 " He 's here . " " Laura ? " I ask into the phone , disoriented , voice sandy with sleep . " Kate . " " Yeah , " I murmur , my head sinking , pushing the receiver deeper into the pillow . " He 's here , " she repeats . " In Croton . " Her words register and my eyes fly open . I sit up . " Awake now ? " she asks . " Yes . " I look over to my bedside table , tilting up straighter to see over the stack of books . The glowing numbers on the clock read 4:43 a.m . " How  --  " " Mick 's been throwing up  --  some kind of stomach flu slash candy cane binge with the baby-sitter . I look out the bathroom window and his mother 's house is lit up like Disney World , called the sheriff 's office and they confirmed it . He 's here . He 's here , Kate . " I fling off the duvet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its metallic stand , I swing both feet to the smooth wood floor of my bedroom . He 's here  --  there . Jake Sharpe . Of course it 's not three P.M. on a Saturday . Of course you reappear in the middle of the night like some nocturnal blood-leech . Adrenaline surges . I grab yoga pants from the chair , pull them up under my nightslip , and tug the little black cardigan from the doorknob . Throwing open the closet doors , I stand on tiptoe , fingernails catching the edgeof my suitcase handle just enough to avalanche it off the shelf , business trip toiletries raining on my head and rolling across the hardwood . I scramble to retrieve the miniature bottles , an anxiety-dream sweat dampening the silk of my slip . Only I 'm awake . And Laura 's flare finally hovers in the night sky over the snowy hills of our hometown . Indignation fuels the whipping open of drawers , fistfuls of underwear , T-shirts , and pajamas filling the case , my mind moving ahead to the important items  --  skinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that knock me up to five-nine . The two zipper toggles collide and I shove my brass travel lock through the holes . Rolling down the hall I push my feet into my sneakers , yank my trench from its hook , open the front door to the cricket quiet of my suburban street , and reach into my pocket for the keys  --  shit , my purse . I whirl in the dark apartment , spotting it hiding on the kitchen table among the boxes of unwritten Christmas cards , rolls of wrapping paper , and my laptop . No . I do n't need my laptop . Just bring the binder to read on the plane . Then I might start the report . Then I might need my laptop . Just bring the laptop . I try to unclip it from the docking station , but my fingers fumble . I flick the light switch on , startled by the jarring brightness . But , oh , this is good , yes , okay , good , light helps . Okay , reality check . I take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , eyes puffed from deprivation of same , brown hair tangled from passing out in forgotten ponytail holder . This is insane . I flick the light back off , swing the front door shut , stalk back to the bedroom , flop on top of the bed , and pull the still-warm duvet over me like a taco . Letting the keys drop from my grip , I will the adrenaline away , will back the peaceful dead-to-the-world repose I was beneath just moments ago . Sleep , Kate . Go back ... to sleep . You 've been working nonstop  --  the conference , the meetings , the forty-two-hour round-trip to Argentina . This bed was all you could think of . Are n't you comfortable ? And relaxed ? Living your life ? Sleeping in your bed ? Is n't it nice to be an adult ... who can get into her own bed ... in her own apartment ... and go to sleep ... on her own timing . My pulse deepens . And not be reduced to some stupid ... knee-jerk ... adolescent ... obsessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up  --  finally shown up  - -  I sit up . Breathless . And within minutes find myself flying along Route 26 , counting off the exits to the Charleston airport . I pull the suitcase from the backseat and lock the Prius with a double beep , glancing up once again at the LONG-TERM PARKING sign . I ignore the implications . This is a swing through , that 's all . An eight-hundred-mile swing through . The sky still black behind me , I pass between the sliding glass doors into a brick-walled trough of canned air and canned music . The lone ticket agent , wearing three-step eyes and impressively pronounced lipstick for predawn , smiles in greeting . " Checking in ? " she asks . I blink at the crimson foil poinsettia pinned to her uniform . " Checking in ? " she repeats . " Yes ? " I answer uncertainly . She looks at me inquisitively as I look at her inquisitively . " Are you sure ? " " Yes . Yes . I 'm going to Croton Falls , Vermont . Burlington is closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drop my purse on the counter and rest my messenger bag heavy with my laptop between my ankles . " Can I see your I.D. ? " I flip open my wallet and slide the plastic over . She looks down at the card with a frown . " Solutions for Sustainability ? " " Sorry . " I trade her my office badge for my license . " And ticket ? " " Actually I do n't have one , but I need to get on the first flight . What do you have ? " She taps the keyboard , and I watch her stare intently at the obscured screen , all the possible routes back to him . " Well , let 's see , there is one seat left on the commuter to Atlanta , then a two-hour layover , which would get you into LaGuardia by three and then another layover ... " " Is that really the earliest I can get there ? " I lift my wheelie onto the metal scale . She tears the outdated baggage tag from the handle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great . Thank you . " " If the weather cooperates you should be in Burlington by six P.M. " Almost twelve hours from now . Rock on . I take my ticket , with its two layovers and one leg in cargo , and make my way to the gate , wishing for a Starbucks , but settling for a man selling the bare basics from a brown Formica cart . Slinging my messenger bag into the overhead bin I take my seat in row thirteen with a bruised banana and large black coffee . I nestle against the plastic wallpaper and let my hair down from its makeshift topknot , my lids drooping shut , blocking out the sensation of everyone settling in around me . " Ladies and gentlemen , the captain has informed us we may be hitting some turbulence , so we will be turning the seat belt sign back on . Please make sure that they are fastened . " I reflexively open my eyes to double-check that I 'm still buckled in beneath my neglected binder on Argentina 's revised pollution regulations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Weekly . " First photos ever ! Jake Sharpe and Eden Millay spotted ring shopping in St. Bart 's . Is it WEDDING BELLS ? " We hit an air pocket and the plane drops , my stomach lurching . " Ladies and gentlemen , we 're now beginning our descent . " Twisting the opening of my bag toward me with my foot to keep it level , I pray those are n't prescient words . I peer out the window for some visual landmark to orient me  --  a landing strip , the distant lights of Burlington , but the blackness seems thick and impermeable . Then the clouds clear the full moon , the snow-covered fields suddenly gleaming as if lit by a flashbulb . I rub my eyes as the wheels touch down . A chapped-cheeked luggage handler emerges through the plastic flaps from the tarmac , pulling the laden metal cart behind him , trailing tread marks of sleet on the tile . He deposits its contents before us , and immediately there 's a flurry of grabbing hands , the snapping of handles extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . I stare for a moment in disbelief at the empty steel trolly . Shit . " Sir ? " I make a beeline to where the man is checking off arriving flights on a clipboard . " Is that all the bags ? " " Sorry , ma'am , there 're baggage delays coming out of New York . If yours is n't there , check with Velma at the desk . She can help you fill out a report . " I drop my head . " Thank you . " As Velma and I fill out the forms she repeatedly promises with a big smile that they will bring my little rolling bag to my door the minute it arrives in Burlington , the minute . Only , she concludes brusquely , as she taps the layers of forms neatly back together on the countertop , it 's Christmas and she ca n't make any promises . I nod , heaving my bags back onto my shoulder , the realization sinking in that I 'm going to be trying to make someone regret his entire existence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  -- ohfuckohfuckohfuck  --  run through the snowdrifts in my sneakers to the few waiting taxis , their mufflers steaming . I slam the door shut behind me with a rusty squeak . " Hi , I 'm going to Croton Falls , please . " " Croton ! " the driver coughs , resting the cigarette on his lip to shift the car into drive . " My cousin 's in Fayville  --  with the Christmas traffic , that could be an hour , easy . " " I know . " I let my bags slide off my shoulder onto the torn vinyl seat . " I 'll pay your return fare . " I re-count the fold of twenties from the LaGuardia ATM . " Please ? " " Suit yourself . " He grumbles our destination to his dispatcher on the CB duct taped to the dashboard . " And , sir ? " I flap the clammy Lycra hems away from my bare ankles . " Would you mind rolling up the window ? " He flicks the glowing butt onto the road as he reaches for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was gon na be snowing ? " I huddle against the maroon vinyl , tucking my legs up under me in an effort to warm the damp fabric . " I did n't think it was going to be December . "
