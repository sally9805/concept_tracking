The Forbidden By Banks , L. A. St. Martin 's Paperbacks Banks , L. A. All was still on level seven . A clawed hand held embryonic life within it . Golden green glowing eyes misted over black as they looked up to the vast expanse of nothingness that mimicked a vaulted ceiling . Trembling with anticipation , a shaky finger extended a hooked talon that prodded at the bloody mass of dormant life . . . life that could be molded into its own image . A hissing coo filled with gentle adoration warmed the small cluster of cells , making them glow red and begin to pulse . " Oh , soon , my son , " a passionate voice whispered . " Very , very soon . " Sydney , Australia . . . Dread tightened Damali 's chest as she watched Carlos 's eyes . Visceral emptiness filled her , making her clutch her lower belly . His once-serene gaze now darted to her face , then to the faces of her teammates and to his surrounding environment like a man displaced and confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choke her heart to a standstill . Her man , once confident , suave , and smooth as black silk , had come up out of the unknown looking crazed and wild in the eye . Suddenly she felt a strange sensation that fluttered in her womb . She pressed her hand against her abdomen . What was that ? But she had to shake off the weird feeling . Too many issues competed for her attention right now and themost immediate was Carlos . The Light had brought him back , had actually reconstituted his form from the burnt vampire ash left by dawn , and now it seemed as though he did n't know where he was , how he 'd gotten there , or whom he was with . Beyond all that they 'd had to contend with , this was perhaps the most frightening experience of all : Carlos Rivera 's mental state was in question -- tears , screaming , ranting , fighting against the hold of friendly hands . Damali turned away for a moment and swallowed hard . A head on a silver platter would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had unfinished business . She reached out her hand to touch Carlos 's face , and he jerked away from her , unsure if she were a mirage , a vampiric illusion , something evil and vile that would start his torture all over again . His fear rippled through her and rattled her bones . It sent a chill through her like a knife . It drew her mouth into a tight line as she fought not to scream . She saw what they had done . A head . The head of the bastard who 'd done this , was the only acceptable answer to levy the debt paid in full . Down in Hell they had a phrase : Fair exchange is no robbery . Then so be it . A head for a head , a mind for a mind . . . and an eye for an eye and a tooth for a fucking tooth -- the chairman 's fangs mounted on her wall mantel . This was war . Damali could feel her eyes narrow to slits as her man tried to stand , and then tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hell no . They 'd raped his mind and stolen his dignity . And for that unforgivable offense , she 'd blow the Vampire Council 's doors off the damned hinges . In her mind 's eye , she could see the pentagram-shaped table surrounded by dark thrones , and the chairman 's smug expression . But Hell had no fury like a woman scorned . Her thoughts frayed and descended to the pit . Fuck you , Mr. Chairman . This time , it 's just me and you . Carlos could feel his eyeballs roll backward beneath his lids as consciousness ebbed and flowed like a reluctant tide . One moment he had been sitting on the ground , naked , awed , and so profoundly moved that he could n't speak , and in the next moment , he was being hurried away by many hands and clamoring voices all trying to get him into a vehicle and onto hallowed ground . Were it not for Damali 's hand firmly holding his and her voice cutting through the mle , he would have tried to escape them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he truly feared he was losing his mind . Something was very wrong . He 'd gone into the Light -- more accurately , had been propelled into it , summoned by it , sucked toward a bright , indescribable iridescent wonder that had a pulse , a center , and held the heartbeat of the universe . Beings of unfathomable strength had hurled him forward , their silvery light sabers cutting at filaments of dark tendrils , holding him , burning him to ash . The heat was so intense that his bones had liquefied , his skin had blackened and crumbled away , his eyes had melted and had run down his cheeks like gory , oozing tears . . . but silver metallic wings with the texture of satin had shielded him from the furnace blast beneath him . What were they and who 'd sent them ? Healing warmth had entered him , coating his burning insides with instant peace , quenching the sun 's fury against his skin . One being had parted to become many with raised golden shields that seemed as though each held a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , each ball of molten , living , golden light fusing to become a ring around him . The ring had covered him , entered him . . . . All he could remember now was that they came and then in a fluttering cloud they 'd dispersed , shooting away so quickly they 'd left only a blinding blur of white light in their wake . But perhaps the powers-that-be had messed up somehow . Maybe they did n't catch his soul in time , and how did a man-turned-vampire return to the sun ? He could n't hear . Everything was coming at him in muffled tones . People spoke in indecipherable guttural fragments . Everyone seemed to move in slow motion . It was like moving through mud . His mind was a slurry of confusion . He was nearly blind , each friendly face blurred beyond recognition until it was breath-close to his face . His skin felt thick and dull , the sensation of hands soothing his shoulders , rubbing his back , bundling him into a coat , but all of it took seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration . The most troubling aspect was the heaviness he felt in his limbs , as though his muscles were too weak to lift his own body . What had the Light done to him ? Carlos leaned forward and covered his face with his hands . The sensory overload was too much -- rather , the lack of sensation and the ability to perceive his surroundings was horrifying . " I think he 's going into shock , " Damali said , drawing him closer against her body as the Jeep careened through the streets . " We have to get him inside , out of the sun . " " I 'm gon na fry , " Carlos croaked , becoming more disoriented as the vehicle barreled through desolate streets in a town he did n't know . " We 'll be at the church in just a few minutes , kiddo . " Carlos slowly removed his hands from his face , training his attention toward what he remembered to be Rider 's voice . " To a church ? " Instinct made Carlos begin struggling against Damali 's hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ! I 'll burn ! " Many strong arms held him . In a distant part of his mind he heard Father Patrick call out to him . " You 've stayed with us on hallowed ground before , Carlos . We have to keep you safe . Remember the woods , the cabin ? The dark side can not know you 've come back . You wo n't burn . " " No ! " More hands held him down as he grabbed at the door handle . . . but these were human hands , hands that should n't have had enough power to hold him , even in his weakened state . He needed to feed and find shelter ! " Stop fighting us , baby , " Damali urged . " It 'll make it worse . Please , Carlos , trust me . " " We 're taking you someplace safe , " an old man 's voice said . It was a familiar voice . In unsteady increments memory came back to him . Father Patrick . . . that 's right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could cross . Yeah . He remembered . The safe house . Damali trusted them . This was her squad . All right . Carlos stopped struggling and closed his eyes . He could feel Damali 's cool hand stroke his brow , wiping away the sweat . He ran his tongue over his incisors to retract his fangs , lest he frighten his benefactors , and then froze . He touched his mouth , running his fingers over his upper canines . Tears sprang to his eyes so quickly he did n't even have time to blink them back . He glanced at Damali , then away , lowering his hands from his face , staring at his palms in disbelief . He 'd been neutered . He wanted to vomit . He curled his hands into fists . He shut his eyes tightly and hung his head . He could feel Damali 's hand stroke his back and he jerked away from her touch . " Do n't . " " It 's Jose , man . Do n't you remember ? " A young , soothing voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . You said you saw angels , hombre . You sat there looking at the sun . You spoke to us , looked at us , sat quietly with D and said you were free . " Carlos shook his head with his eyes closed , pressing his fingers to his temples . " No . I do n't remember . Shut up , you 're confusing me ! " " Ease off , Jose , " the voice he knew as Rider 's said in almost a whisper . " Father Pat , Marlene , either of you guys got something for dude -- something to help him bite the snake that bit him ? " He felt hysteria rising in him . Carlos chuckled , but he kept his eyes closed . The sound was hollow even to his own ears . Rider . That 's right . Hombre was human and had brass balls . . . had been chained to the ground as bait while the harpies pulled out his guts . Crazy white dude yelling at Hell 's worst nightmare , talking trash with no weapon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him a chance to beat the rising sun . Very cool of Rider . . . he would n't forget the debt . " You drink Jack Daniel 's , right ? Add a little color in it for me and I 'll buy you a drink , man . After what we just went through on the docks -- you buy ; I 'll fly . Cool ? " Silence in the vehicle surrounded him . No one but him was laughing . He could feel the vehicle slowing down . " Get him inside , Father Pat , " an older woman said from somewhere within the Jeep . " He 's delirious . " A pair of strong arms threaded around his back and nearly lifted him off his feet . What seemed like a battalion of clerics wearing long black robes and white collars accosted him with phalanges of holy water , striking at him in the sign of the cross , making him cringe , as he turned his face away to protect it from the assault , to no avail . Relentless , they swung heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burly brother hoisted him over his shoulder and advanced up the cathedral steps . He could feel several hands dressing him . . . someone was anointing his head with oil . Then he was being moved again , up what seemed like an endless spiral of stairs . Footsteps , many , many footfalls , rushing like a military SWAT unit , followed him . The sound of choppers in the air , bright sunlight filled his eyes and touched his face , but like the incense and holy water , it did n't burn . Why ? he dimly wondered . Confusion tore at his brain . Blurred white birds of metal with a crest on the side . . . blue , a crown of thorns , a sword , a bleeding heart -- just like Father Pat 's medallion -- opened at the side , filling its belly with humans that eagerly climbed in and dragged him with them . This was a vampire 's true Hell . The chairman had indeed had the last laugh . The choppers were flying toward the sun ! Carlos braced himself against the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture him ? Pilots wearing dark aviator sunglasses never turned around as he begged them to release him from the Sea of Perpetual Agony . He suddenly feared Damali 's touch ; what beast would she turn into ? An Amanthra ? He squeezed his eyes shut , refusing to watch her gorgeous brown eyes change into slanted , glowing orbs while her beautiful body transformed into a serpentine menace . Or maybe the chairman would be particularly cruel and she would become a were-demon . It would be a painful taunt to remind him of his brush with that entity in the Amazon ; Hell always beat your ass down with past mistakes in the place where there was no such thing as forgiveness . Carlos 's thoughts scrambled , trying to figure out an escape , a way to negotiate a shorter sentence . Hell was eternal , so peace and the lack of acute pain had to be measured in milliseconds . For every minute that passed where no direct pain was being inflicted , he had a chance to rest , maybe regenerate , just enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . If he was n't in pain , he could think . If he could think , he could bargain . But what aces did he hold ? What could he barter with at this juncture ? When the choppers touched down in a deserted section of airport runway , and the illusion of humans helped him toward a crest-bearing private jet at the end of the landing strip , he had to wonder just what the chairman had in store for him now . And could he bear it ? Carlos opened his eyes , his breathing labored as he tried to form words . He searched the impostor Damali 's face as she led him by the hand with Big Mike on his flank helping him walk . " Where ? " was all he could manage to get out . " Ethiopia , " she said quietly , tears shining in her eyes . " Baby , we have to get out of Sydney and go to a Christian stronghold there . It 's said that is where the Ark of the Covenant is held . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By nightfall , the Vampire Council might send a cleanup crew to look for your ashes that do n't exist , so we have to leave now . Then , we 'll take a transcontinental flight to Algeria . . . the mosques there are old , but we have to avoid the site of the pending Armageddon , the Middle East . Understand ? " None of what she was saying made any sense . The big brother -- an international courier ?  - -  was pulling him down the tarmac with the impostor of Father Pat jogging beside them to keep pace . Knowing that resistance was not an option within the inquisition chambers , which only seemed to steal his strength faster , Carlos stopped struggling against them . He had to be strategic . " As soon as we get clearance , we have to get you behind the walls of the Vatican , " the cleric said . " Until they 're sure of what you are . . . all the Covenant can do is keep you on the move , from fortress to fortress . " Carlos cocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how the Covenant operated , not at this level of detail . Carlos peered at the man who 'd spoken , then looked at the one who was supposed to be Rider . " Dude , the Vatican is like the Pentagon for the guys with the collar -- just like Asula ca n't just waltz you into Mecca until you 're checked out , dig ? " the supposed Rider said as they walked up the jet 's narrow steps . " So , they 're gon na have to take you to their hideaways in the hills . . . sorta like being an alien and getting shuttled to Area 51 till ya spec out . Now why we all have to go along for the ride with your boy Berkfield is beyond me . I , for one , know I did n't get bitten , although Damali 's case is a little --  " " Everybody get on the plane , " a tall brother with locks said , his gaze lethal . His tone made the group stop walking as he slowly pointed to each person . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twister of harpies on their asses , and came into the church bloodied and beat up . Jose , Dan , J.L. , and Rider were also riding in the VIP vamp limos , alone , with what was then a council-level master vamp -- Rivera . Me and Mike were on the yacht , like the others eventually were , and in unseen , dark corridors away from the group at times long enough to get nicked . Mar , Father Pat , Father Lopez , Monk Lin , and Imam Asula were all on standby , in speedboats , out in the open , in the dead of night . My point is , any one of us could have gotten nicked . You think the powers-that-be are going to let us roll up on the pope with who knows how many vamps and a potential daywalker in our midst ? " He shook his head , then turned his back to the teams and strode up the jet 's steps . " Our side ai n't taking no chances , and I do n't blame them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a weary tone . " Life as we knew it has just ceased to exist . " The names began to link with the faces as the memory of what had happened came back to him in fits and spurts . The past came back in snatches of quilted memory . Without resistance he slowly walked up the steps and entered the jet , noting the somber expressions around him as everyone took their seats . Again , he searched Damali 's face for confirmation that the truth had been told , and found it . She clasped his hand and led him to a seat , one hand touching the small Isis dagger at her hip . " I 've got your back , " she said , her eyes holding his . " They 've got mine . It 's gon na be all right . " He nodded , slowly beginning to believe that this was all real . But as he fastened his seat belt with a click and slowly turned to stare out the window at the sun , Marlene 's words rang in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with that sudden knowledge , an acute sadness that he dared never share with another living soul entered his being ; life as they 'd known it was null and void .
