Section : Up Front As the nation braces for one of its worst battles with flu , the illness claims its first , and youngest , victims <p> As Sunday-afternoon children 's parties go , the Nov. 30 birthday celebration in a quiet neighborhood of Pueblo , Colo. , was a standard free-for-all . " My son Dezmond was just learning how to throw rocks , " says Brian Huckabay , 24 , the father of 20-month-old twins Dezmond and Diego . " He would pick up a rock and throw it , then pick it up again and throw it farther . Before you know it , he was zinging the rocks . " But by the following morning the boy was showing signs of illness . " My hijo Spanish for son woke up sick , " recalls Huckabay . " We thought it was just a cold . He had a runny nose , coughing and wheezing . " <p> The illness proved to be far worse . After four days of increasingly grave symptoms and two trips to the doctor , Dezmond was pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children around the country to die from what health officials are already calling one of the worst flu seasons in decades . " In my 30 years on the job I 've never seen an outbreak this bad , " says Dr. James Todd , director of epidemiology at Denver Children 's Hospital , where four of the deaths have occurred . Nationwide doctors are scrambling to cope with a new , virulent form of the virus as well as with a shortage of vaccines to help fight it . About 36,000 people die each year from the flu ; according to Dr. Martin Blaser of the Infectious Diseases Society of America , the death toll this year could rise to 50,000 . <p> Although authorities are quick to point out that the elderly account for more than 90 percent of fatalities caused by the flu , this year 's unusually high death toll among young children so early in the season serves as a reminder that patients under 2 can be among the most vulnerable . " We build our immunity as we grow up , " says Dr. Octavio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center , Dallas . " The first encounter with the virus is likely to cause a severe disease because children have n't been exposed before . " <p> Brian Huckabay and his common-law wife , Janelle Portillos , had no inkling of the danger their son was facing when he woke up feeling ill after the birthday party down the street . " Janelle had taken the twins to get a flu shot about a week before , " says Huckabay , a short-order cook at a restaurant in Pueblo . A day later , when Dezmond 's twin , Diego , became sick as well , Brian called a doctor who recommended giving the children ibuprofen or Children 's Tylenol to keep their fevers down . But the following night Dezmond lay on the couch , " covered up , fussy and not even playing with a single toy , " says Huckabay . Portillos , 19 , a nurse 's aide , realized something was wrong and drove the twins to the hospital . <p> There the babies were examined by a doctor and sent home with a prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave the boys their medicine . But just three hours later , her mother , Cicilia , 52 , discovered Dezmond cold and unresponsive . By the time Huckabay rushed to his son from work , police and paramedics were swarming on the lawn . " I knew in my heart that my son was gone , " he says . " The boy was fine on Sunday , and three days later , everything had changed forever . " <p> Although Dezmond had been given a flu shot , in all likelihood his inoculation had not yet taken effect . Adult vaccinations begin to offer protection after two weeks ; the waiting period is even longer for babies , who normally require two shots spaced a month apart . Next year , when the vaccine supply is likely to be increased , doctors will be urging parents to give every child over 6 months a flu shot . <p> Perhaps that will help prevent what happened to 14-month-old Jeremy Beaumont of Colorado Springs . On Thanksgiving Day he , like Dezmond Huckabay , came down with a cough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 was diagnosed with the flu . He was sent home with instructions for his mother , Lindsey , 18 , a homemaker , to give him Children 's Tylenol and Motrin . His condition did improve , but on the morning of Dec. 3 , Lindsey reached into Jeremy 's crib to check his diaper . " He looked like he was sleeping , " she says , " but I rolled him over , and he did n't wake up . " When Jeremy reached Memorial Hospital by ambulance , he was already dead . Today , a devastated Lindsey  --  whose husband , Alvin , 26 , a sergeant serving with the Army 's First Armored Division in Iraq , returned to Colorado for their son 's funeral on Dec. 11  --  has only words of caution for other parents . " A 12-year-old can say , ' I ca n't breathe , ' " she says . " Babies ca n't .

The vaccine  --  of which 83 million doses were created this year  --  is already in short supply , and doctors in hard-hit states like Texas and New Mexico are being asked to give priority to health-care workers , patients with chronic diseases and others who are most vulnerable to the virus . Further complicating the situation , the vaccine now in distribution does n't protect as well against the virulent Fujian flu strain , which only began to emerge as the vaccine was being manufactured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new batch , the current vaccine  --  if you can find it  --  is still the best option . <p> To learn more about the flu , PEOPLE correspondent Giovanna Breu spoke with Dr. William Schaffner , 66 , chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville . <p> Is the flu more dangerous this year ? <p> Yes it is . It has begun earlier , is spreading more rapidly , and one particular strain of flu making the rounds , Fujian , makes people more ill than a normal flu . We 've also had early reports of fatalities . <p> How many people will get the disease this year ? <p> Probably about one fourth of the population . Obviously , the vast majority of those will have milder cases , but with numbers like that , you can also expect a lot of complications . <p> What kind of complications ? <p> In some cases people will develop pneumonia severe enough to require hospital treatment . Flu affects not just the bronchial tubes and lungs but the entire body . So it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . <p> Why are young children vulnerable ? <p> Because their immune systems are not well-developed , and they have n't developed the resistance to random infections that older children and adults have . <p> Who else is at risk ? <p> Older people and anyone who has an underlying disease of the heart or lung . Also , people with diabetes or whose immunity is compromised . The vaccine is recommended , and has been proven safe , for women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy as well . They have the same risk of hospitalization as the elderly . <p> If you have n't been able to get the vaccine , what can you do to protect yourself ? <p> Wash your hands frequently . It 's low-tech but terribly important , and it really works . Healthy people between the ages of 5 and 49 can also consider receiving a vaccine mist that is inhaled through the nose . It 's more expensive than a shot , and , unlike the needle-administered vaccine , gives a sore throat and a runny nose for a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the full-blown flu . <p> If you do get the flu , should you go to the doctor ? <p> If you are hit hard by the flu and have a condition like a heart or lung disease , see your doctor , who may give you an antiviral medication . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Six-year-old Lauren Rogers gets a flu shot in Mesa , Ariz . <p>
