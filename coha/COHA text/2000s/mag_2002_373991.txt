Five years ago , Chuck Thompson and his wife Chris moved from the Philadelphia suburbs , where they had raised their three children , back into Chuck 's parents ' home in Levittown , Pa. , to assume full-time care of Charles Sr. , 76 , and Ruth , 73 . Charles ' worsening dementia and Ruth 's health problems meant that if the parents were to stay in the family home , someone would have to live with them . Chuck , 56 , says that as the oldest of the Thompson offspring and with his kids grown , he most naturally got the job . Now he cooks the meals , maintains the house and manages his ailing parents ' complicated medical care  --  all while running a home-based marketing business . Even though he describes his daily life as careening from crisis to crisis , Chuck says he copes with his complicated caregiving duties only with a lot of help from his " team "  --  his brother and sisters . <P> Chuck is lucky enough to be one of six children , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . Brother Scott , a lawyer , has power of attorney and handles legal issues . Sisters Jodie and Diane live nearby and help with doctor 's visits and by sitting with their parents at home when Chuck and Chris go out . Just now sister Nina is taking a week off from her job as a social worker in Auburn , Maine , to spell Chuck for a few days , something she does four times a year . The other siblings take turns parent sitting so that Chuck and Chris can get in their weekly golf game and attend meetings of Children of Aging Parents , their caregivers ' support group . Says Chuck : " In support group , we see battles and heartbreak in families where siblings do n't help out . I got so lucky with my brother and sisters , because I truly could n't do this without them . " <P> Gem Brown is less fortunate . Although she is one of five children , Gem , 36 , bears most of the responsibility for her ailing father Hencliffe , 73 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a medical home-care company , has moved her dad into her two-bedroom condo in Mount Laurel , N.J. , so that she can look after him . She has enrolled her father at the Tender , an adult day-care program that he attends while she 's at the office , and she schedules morning doctor 's visits so she can get to work on time . Gem 's brother Marshall , 44 , and his wife Nancy help out by playing host to Dad in the afternoon when day care is over and fixing dinner for the family before Gem arrives to take him home . But Gem thinks her other three siblings , all of whom live in the area , should pitch in more . " If they would participate more in his daily care , it would make things so much easier for all of us , " she says . " I just wish they would roll up their sleeves and help . " <P> Caring for ailing parents is a burden that a growing number of families now face as the elderly population increases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to older relatives , according to the Department of Health and Human Services . And an estimated 90% of caregiving takes place at home . Deciding which sibling makes sure that Mom takes her daily medicines or that Dad regularly gets out for some fresh air can add strain to an already stressful situation .
