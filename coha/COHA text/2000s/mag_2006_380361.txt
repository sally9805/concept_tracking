Hoop Dreams . Crumb . Michael Moore 's Roger &; Me . Errol Morris ' The Thin Blue Line . Michael Apted 's 7 Up series . These are some of the finest documentary features in recent decades , and they share one distinction : none received an Oscar , or even a nomination , for Best Documentary . An outcry over the exclusion of films like these and charges of cronyism within the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ' selection committee led to rules changes in 2001 . So this year 's list will be a lot sharper , eh ? <P> Nay . Let 's name five of the most acclaimed nonfiction films of 2005 . The Aristocrats is the deconstruction , by dozens of comedians , of the world 's most notorious dirty joke . Why We Fight cogently analyzes the U.S. military-industrial complex . The Power of Nightmares provocatively compares the doctrines of al-Qaeda and the American neo-cons . Werner Herzog 's Grizzly Man , a study of a wildlife activist 's annual trip to commune with the beasts who finally tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoking human love and obsession . It shared the New York Film Critics ' Circle award for Best Documentary with Herzog 's The White Diamond , about an attempt to fly an airship over the Guyanese rain forest  --  sheer soaring rapture . <P> All five films received fervent reviews . And none made the preliminary Oscar short list of 15 documentary features , from which will come five nominees to be revealed next week . <P> The Academy 's regulations , which are about as byzantine as Medicaid rules , disqualify a film that 's been shown on TV before its theatrical opening . So Why We Fight was out , because it had aired on the BBC ( which co-produced it ) . As for Grizzly Man , we guess the selectors just did n't like it . Arthur Dong , a governor of the Academy 's documentary branch , ca n't say why any film was refused because " we do n't discuss the films among ourselves . " But could he give his own opinion of Grizzly Man ? " No . " <P> Herzog sounds serene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of sleep over it , " he says . " I 'm perfectly content with the success of the film with audiences and critics . " <P> One could still cull a comely quintet of nominees from the current gang of 15  --  including Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room , Mad Hot Ballroom , Murderball , Rize and , of course , March of the Penguins . Perhaps Herzog can take solace in the fact that , as those penguins proved , persistence is everything . <P> Read Corliss 's coverage of the Oscar nominations on
