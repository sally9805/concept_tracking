The tall man guided his new Mercedes out of Avenue Casanova traffic and pulled in behind a battered Volkswagen at the gutter ; he had just seen the Ford van several cars ahead of him pull over , its emergency flashers on . He leaned to the side , straining for a clear view around the cars and trucks honking , jockeying for position , crowding the avenue . It was late-10:34 , he affirmed with a glance at his Rolex-and the glare of so many lights on the rainwashed streets made him squint . He watched the van 's driver get out , wait for a break in the traffic , and then jog across the street toward some sort of commotion . There were children running-one was on the ground , a boy . A heavyset man in a dirty white apron was yelling at the fallen boy , kicking him , and the boy curled into a ball . A girl threw herself between the fallen boy and the man ; the man pushed her down . The van 's driver arrived and held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who yelled back . <p> There was nothing unusual about the scene . It was played out scores of times on this and many other Caracas streets every night : hungry , homeless children scrabbling for a living , treated as nothing more than human refuse by the adults annoyed by them or who sought them for other purposes . One needed no more excuse to kick-or exploit , in any of dozens of unsavory ways-a street urchin than one did a stray dog . <p> The tall man had seen the driver of the van , a missionary , make several such stops over the past few days , usually at night , chatting with groups of these children , teasing them , making them laugh , talking to them as long as the children were willing to stay . Twice the tall man had managed to get close enough to overhear the missionary asking kids where they lived , whether they had enough to eat , whether any of them were sick or knew other children who were sick , whether there were other homeless children nearby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldea Esperanza . Hope Village . The tall man knew exactly where it was ; he had driven past it , slowly . It was a mission-a place that took in young homeless ones . <p> The missionary stepped between the angry man and the two children on the ground . The girl was talking to the fallen boy . She looked worried . The man in the apron pushed past the missionary and grabbed something from the young girl 's hand , then brandished it at the missionary - evidence , no doubt , that the children had stolen from him . The missionary pointed toward the children , spoke to the man , and then reached into his pocket and offered to pay for what the children had stolen . The man grabbed it and stalked away , still yelling back over his shoulder . <p> Three or four other children wandered back as the aproned man disappeared . If any of these children had a home with a bed , they would undoubtedly have been in it by this time of night . <p> A group of young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them taking swigs from their bottles of beer . The avenue was crowded with those seeking thrills , as well as the homeless . From across the street , a prostitute caught the tall man 's eye and waved . He ignored her . Peering around a passing truck , he watched as the missionary knelt and placed his hand on the forehead of the young boy . <p> This was a good thing that the missionary was doing . The tall man admired him for it . Yes , it was time to meet him face-to-face . Maybe he was the right man for the job . Maybe not . <p> * * * <p> The rain had stopped , at least for now . <p> " +Hay algun familiar de este chico ? " David asked . He removed his hand from the child 's forehead . The boy was burning with fever , gasping desperately ; his chest rattled . <p> " Si . " <p> David glanced up at the girl who had tried to protect the boy ; she could not have been more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He started coughing five days ago , " she said . " And after he runs , he can not breathe . " <p> " What 's his name ? " <p> " Ricardo . My name is Angela . " <p> David smiled and touched her arm . " Angela , where are your parents ? " <p> Angela shrugged . David saw this response often . It meant that the girl 's parents were drug addicts , or that they were dead , or that she had no idea where they were and probably had n't seen them in some time . <p> He brushed Ricardo 's lank hair from his forehead . For five years now David had patrolled the barrios of Caracas , witnessing the misery of an endless supply of impoverished and sickly and homeless children . Was there no end to the suffering here ? <p> Swarms of Latinos hurried by in the warm , humid night , seemingly unaware . Salsa music blared from one of the bars down the street . Honking cars , trucks , and buses jammed Avenue Casanova . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note blending with the fragrance of fresh arepas , frying chilies , refried beans , and beer . " Vmanos , arriba ! " someone yelled from down the street . <p> Ricardo stared at David with sunken , panicked eyes , his back rising off the broken sidewalk in his effort to pull air into his lungs . <p> " How old is your brother ? " David asked Angela . <p> " Siete . " <p> There was no point calling an ambulance . They refused to pick up the homeless . David pulled out his cell and called his wife . " Christie , call Dr. Vargas and see if he can meet us at the clinic in forty-five minutes . Tell him I have a seven-year-old boy I think is in the acute stages of pneumonia . He can barely breathe . " <p> There was a pause . " Is he wheezing ? " she asked . <p> " Big-time . " <p> " Okay . Get him here quick . " <p> When David clicked off his phone and reached behind the boy to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David looked up to see a tall , well-dressed man . <p> " Can I please help you ? " The stranger spoke in English . " We can put him in my car just down the street if you need transportation to the hospital . " <p> " Thank you , " David said , " but my van 's right here . " He nodded toward the white nine-passenger Ford van he used as both bus and ambulance . It was double-parked , emergency flashers blinking , Aldea Esperanza painted in bright red letters on the side . " I 'm taking this child to my clinic . " <p> Before David could object , the tall man lifted Ricardo 's thin little body into his arms and headed for the van . David grabbed Angela 's hand and , weaving through honking , halting traffic , hurried ahead to open the back doors . Inside lay a mattress neatly wrapped with clean white sheets . The man gently laid Ricardo on the mattress . <p> David motioned for Angela to climb into the back of the van with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Two of them are also coughing . " <p> David looked back across the street , where seven children stood watching . He glanced at the well-dressed man , who shrugged . <p> " We do n't have room , " David said . " I 'm sorry . Right now , I can only take your brother and you . And for your brother 's sake , we must hurry . " <p> " Then take Maria instead of me . She has been coughing for three days , " Angela replied . <p> David looked at the stranger , then across the street again . " Jesus , help ... " he whispered , then asked , " Which one is Maria ? " <p> Angela yelled , " Maria , ven ! " motioning Maria forward . <p> A girl David guessed to be about the same age as Angela wove her way through traffic toward them . Without asking , Angela quickly shoved Maria up into the back of the van next to her brother . <p> Always choices , David thought , and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God to simply choose among the least bad alternatives ? <p> He put his hand on Angela 's shoulder , urging her into the van with Ricardo and Maria . As she scrambled in , she smiled . Already a skilled negotiator , David thought . <p> David shook the stranger 's hand and hurried to the driver 's door . " Thank you for your help . " He grabbed a business card from the dash and handed it to the man , then cranked the engine and slammed the door . " Why do n't you visit us ? " he hollered through the window , over the engine noise . <p> " I would like to . Perhaps soon . " <p> David waved over his shoulder and inched out into traffic , his headlights reflecting on slick , wet streets . Ricardo hacked a loud , racking cough . <p> David took a sharp right , leaving the business district and entering a darker , less congested area , a faster way home . Big raindrops began again , slowly at first , then pounding hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid rubber drumsticks . And there was another sound . At first David thought that the windshield wipers were broken-the motor giving out , wheezing ... and then he realized that the sound was coming from the back of the van . It stopped . David glanced in the rearview mirror . The boy 's sister hovered over Ricardo . " Angela , how 's your brother back there ? " David asked . " Everything okay ? " <p> Angela 's little face tilted up , her eyes frightened . " Seor ! " she said . " He can not breathe ! He is choking ! " <p> Chapter Two On a remote beach several miles south of La Guaira , they slipped ashore an hour before midnight , undetected except by the small pod of dolphins that followed their ten-foot inflatable to within a hundred yards of the beach . Their GPS took them within fifteen feet of the location they 'd targeted . They pulled their craft onto the beach and crouched next to it for a few minutes , listening , watching shadows . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his left ran in a crouch across the deserted beach to the rocky slope behind it . In the light from his tiny waterproof flashlight , he found the package exactly where they 'd been told it would be . He signaled with his flashlight to the men waiting by the inflatable , who pulled the craft the rest of the way across the beach into the shadows . <p> The leader of the four Israeli mercenaries took the package , wrapped in plastic to protect it from the rain , and carefully opened it . Code-named Hawkeye , he was not a big man by Western standards . At 5 ' 10 " and 180 pounds , he would n't have looked out of place dressed in casual clothes and walking down the streets of any city in the Western hemisphere . He 'd just turned forty-one . His skin was a sun-darkened bronze . He had black , short-cropped hair . There was a small scar on his right cheek , just under his eye , from a knife wound . It had damaged a facial nerve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the body of a decathlete and a razor-sharp mind , he had excelled in every aspect of his training . Never impatient , never overconfident , and always alert to his surroundings , Hawkeye was , in all aspects , a killing machine . <p> The package , as he had expected , contained fake IDs , room keys , and directions to the resort hotel where they would stay , along with the equivalent in Venezuelan cash of twenty-five thousand U.S. dollars and the key to a waiting vehicle . <p> No stranger to this kind of work , Hawkeye hired out all over the world . Although earlier he 'd done it for love of country , now he did it for money . Big money . His last assignment had been for the CIA in Uganda , Africa , secretly exterminating the thugs who were terrorizing the country . <p> " Drop ! " came a nearly inaudible voice , and all four men dropped , disappearing into the shadows . Each immediately saw why the command had been given : wandering down the beach from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed in no hurry . There was something in his hand . If it was a weapon , he was a dead man . Hawkeye flipped down his night-vision goggles , then shook his head . It was a bottle . The man was walking slowly because he walked clumsily , unsteadily . Just a drunk . <p> But the drunk nearly stumbled in the slight rut made by the inflatable where the mercenaries had pulled it across the beach . When he regained his balance , he gazed down , then turned to follow the furrow with his eyes down to the waves - and turned again , craning his neck forward as if to try to follow the furrow up the beach in the pale light . <p> Hawkeye felt the man on his right tense , and he put out his hand and touched him . Not yet . <p> A long moment passed . No one moved . Then the drunk lifted his bottle , tilted it straight up as if draining it , tossed it away into the waves , and continued down the beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight , another minute for good measure , and then at Hawkeye 's signal began gathering their equipment . One opened the valves on the inflatable and sat on it to speed its deflation . Another used a branch to obliterate the trail their boat had left across the sand . <p> They bedded down across the highway , hidden among palm trees and tall grasses , relieving each other on watch every two hours . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
