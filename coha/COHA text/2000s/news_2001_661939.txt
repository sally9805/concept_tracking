When Britain 's Royal Aircraft Establishment reassigned David B. Barrett from airplane design to missiles and warheads in 1952 , it became a turning point - and not just for him . <p> The aeronautical engineer quit to train for the Church of England priesthood , expressing hope the church could make use of his mathematics expertise and pioneering computer work . <p> " Forget science completely , " his bishop advised . But Barrett could not . <p> Since adding a religion doctorate from Columbia University to his technical background , he has spent 40 years systematizing information on world religions , a calling he discovered while assigned as an Anglican missionary in Africa . <p> Now 73 , Barrett recently culminated his oddly remarkable career with publication of the second edition of his global accounting of faiths and the faithful - trends , detail and his best estimated count of believers of all religions in each of 238 nations and territories . <p> Never has there been such a thorough reference as the two large volumes , running 1,699 pages , of the World Christian Encyclopedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggedly visited most of the lands in person , collecting raw material , including national census figures and United Nations data , and recruiting the 444 specialists who feed him material . Among them : Vatican missions librarian Willi Henkel and editor J. Gordon Melton of the " Encyclopedia of American Religions . " <p> Barrett 's encyclopedia sought to count each human being in each religion and religious subcategory in each country as of 1900 , 1970 , 1990 , 1995 and 2000 , with projections to 2025 . <p> The 2001 edition , successor to his 1983 first edition which took a decade to compile , identifies 10,000 distinct religions , of which 150 have 1 million or more followers . Within Christianity , he counts 33,830 denominations . <p> Barrett also calculates religious populations for the Encyclopaedia Britannica Book of the Year , standard estimates that are used in turn by the World Almanac and innumerable journalists . <p> Such numbers are always debatable , but they 're the best available . " We do n't really have any rivals , " Barrett says . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Encyclopedia , when it covers faith groups from Afghan Zoroastrians ( 304,000 ) to Zimbabwean animists ( 3.52 million ) ? Though Barrett says he publishes factual , unbiased data , he readily acknowledges it has a purpose : to serve as an informational undergirding for Christian mission work . <p> " I do n't have the gift of evangelism through personality . I do n't have the gift of traditional preaching , " explains the soft-spoken Barrett . <p> Is he a missionary , then ? " Certainly , but not the shouter on the street . " <p> He calls his blend of religion and science " missiometrics . " <p> Barrett 's encyclopedia shows immense global shifts between 1900 and 2000 in various faiths ' shares of the global population . Though Christianity became the first truly universal religion in terms of geography and remained the biggest , it lost a bit of market share . Second-ranking Islam expanded considerably and Hinduism somewhat , while Buddhism declined . Chinese and other folk faiths dropped precipitously , as did Judaism . <p> The non-religious or atheistic category , negligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's people at one point but has declined since European Communism 's fall . <p> Today , Barrett and his tiny staff work in unprepossessing quarters in a Presbyterian church basement in Richmond . They 're producing a CD-ROM version of the findings , as well as analytical articles . It 's a long way from his beginnings . <p> A one-time nonbeliever , Barrett made a born-again Christian commitment as a Cambridge University undergraduate . <p> A year later , he says , " I woke up in the middle of the night and became convinced that Christ was present . I ca n't explain it . I heard Christ say , you ought to go to the ends of the world . " <p> His ordination following years in science let him respond to this dramatic missionary call . <p> Barrett was assigned to Kenya to conducted a field survey of Africans ' complex church affiliations . That research was the start of his lifelong specialization , and of the global counts in the first edition of his encyclopedia . <p> But Barrett had to cope with turmoil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hit by machine-gun fire and then thieves ransacked the place , making off with books , computers and floppy disks full of data . Fortunately , the first edition was already in print , so the losses were limited . <p> In 1985 , 28 years after he arrived in Africa and three years after his encyclopedia first came out , he reluctantly sought refuge in the more placid Richmond , Va . There , he had been offered an office and logistical support at the Southern Baptist Convention 's foreign mission board . <p> But Barrett prizes independence so that he can write whatever he wants , and he later shifted to an independent research agency , Global Evangelization Movement . Still an Anglican missionary , Barrett continued to get approval for his work from the Church Missionary Society in London . A young U.S. Presbyterian layman , Todd M. Johnson , signed on in 1989 as co-editor . <p> The biggest Christian shift since the encyclopedia 's first edition is the emergence of the 386 million " independents " as the second biggest category , after the 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , mostly in developing countries . Sizable examples : Brazil 's Universal Church of the Kingdom of God , the Jesus is Lord Fellowship in the Philippines and South Africa 's Zion Christian Church . <p> Barrett thinks their growth could prove as important as the 16th-century rise of the Protestants , who now rank third with 342 million . Orthodox number 215 million ; Anglicans , 80 million . <p> The independent churches have no formal ties to those three Christian categories or Catholicism , which encompassed virtually all Christian believers in 1900 . The independents are forming networks somewhat like traditional denominations but style themselves as " post-denominational , " Barrett says . <p> Barrett watched the independent sector 's growth up close . When the Anglicans first posted him to Kenya in 1957 , he was supposed to work alongside an African priest , Matthew Ajuoga . But Ajuoga had just joined a big breakaway of African independents and Barrett was forbidden by the Anglican hierarchy to contact him . <p> Today , Ajuoga heads an alliance of 85 million African independent church members . <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pentecostals , who believe in receipt of " gifts " of the Holy Spirit , including speaking in tongues . He also notes increases in the similar Charismatics in traditional denominations , and " Neo-Charismatics " in independent churches . <p> Both Barrett and Johnson call themselves Charismatic , part of the Holy Spirit movement in old-line denominations , and their estimate that the related Pentecostal and Charismatic movements encompass 524 million believers will be one of their work 's more controversial statistics . No one else has attempted such an estimate . <p> The encyclopedia is interested in material as well as spiritual needs . It calculates that only 44 percent of the world 's people are living comfortably , with 10 percent " scraping by , " 28 percent " poor and needy " and 18 percent " destitute . " <p> Among its other claims : <p> - The full Bible is available in 1,943 languages and the New Testament in an additional 2,897 . <p> - Christians baptize 122,000 new members in the average day . <p> - Organized Christianity spends $270 billion a year on all causes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clippings and questioning experts in church finance . <p> As the encyclopedia documents , Christianity 's population center is inexorably shifting . Growth is in the Southern Hemisphere especially , notably in Africa . <p> Johnson , who may succeed Barrett as the world 's top soul-counter one day , looks ahead . He sees that Christianity started out the past century 81 percent white and ended at 45 percent . And he knows that 's not going to stop . <p> " This is a huge change , not just ethnically but in what Christianity is all about . Christianity is steadily moving from this Caucasian , European-dominated , modern way of life , even beyond Christianity as an institution , " he says . " There 's no central , unifying narrative .
