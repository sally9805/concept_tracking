Headnote Three years ago , Congress passed legislation expanding Petrified Forest National Park , setting aside more than 100,000 acres of land that fascinate geologists and paleontologists alike . But things have n't quite turned out the way they were supposed to . Mike Fitzgerald stands within a vanished world , his work boots crunching loose white gravel as he sidesteps fossil remains along a path teeming with petroglyphs . Amiable and lanky , he is a cowboy by birth . But recently , he has become an impromptu tour guide , hauling visitors to the primordial treasures strewn across his Twin Buttes Ranch in northern Arizona . Fitzgerald does n't relish his new role . But he 's revealing this hidden world to outsiders in the hopes that they 'll persuade Congress to protect it . Still , he is n't holding his breath . Today , he 's among several ranchers waiting to transfer property to the adjacent Petrified Forest National Park . Those ranchers thought they already had a deal back in 2004 , when Congress authorized a 125,000-acre expansion of the park , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petroglyphs and other artifacts from the Triassic period , the new boundary would enhance a wilderness area and enclose a globally significant fossil repository called the Chinle Escarpment . Stretching along six miles of parkland ( and extending as far as Utah ) , the huge formation contains remains dating back 220 million years , from crocodile-like phytosaurs to armored , plant-eating aetosaurs . But that authorization was just the first step . The next step-getting the funding or " appropriations " to make the actual purchase-is proving an even bigger challenge . And the hold-up threatens to unravel pending deals with these willing sellers . " I do n't think I can hold out much longer , " says Fitzgerald , who quit the cattle business in 2002 after his herd was devastated by steady drought . Now he needs money , and if it does n't come from Congress , it could just as easily come from real estate speculators eager to snatch this ranchland bordering a national park . " We have these natural resources out here , and the federal government says they want it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Therein lies a very complex question , one steeped in politics and federal budget restraints . Still , its hardly a new one , according to David Brooks , senior Democratic counsel for the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee . Amid high hopes , Brooks helped draft Petrified Forest 's expansion legislation . Now , like everyone else , he 's waiting for it to be funded . " It 's not uncommon for acquisitions to lag several years behind the authorization , " says Brooks . But that lag time has grown even longer in recent years , as a conservative Congress has proven to be quite stingy with expansion funds . Brooks blames powerful appropriations committee chairs who were philosophically opposed to federal land acquisition . Although he predicts opposition to soften as Congress shifts to Democratic control , he does n't expect acquisition funds to simply start flowing . " The budget numbers set the parameters for how much money is available for park boundaries , " he says . " And those numbers are pretty tight . " And Petrified Forest is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeing land they consider critical for preservation . It ranges from key wildlife habitat within southern Arizona 's Saguaro National Park to historic battlefields at Gettysburg National Military Park threatened by adjacent development ( see sidebar , page 50 ) . Much of the challenge arises from Congress 's failure to follow through on a promise made more than 40 years ago . In 1964 , President Lyndon Johnson signed legislation creating the Land and Water Conservation Fund , which was to set aside up to $450 million annually to fund land acquisition for the federal agencies including the Park Service and Forest Service using revenue generated primarily from off-shore oil and gas drilling . But Congress often chooses to spend that money elsewhere . In recent years , the amount allocated to purchase national park lands has fallen from $125 million in 2001 to $31 million in 2006 . The legislative boundaries of national parks now include 1.8 million acres of privately owned land valued at approximately $1.9 billion . Valley Forge National Historical Park in Pennsylvania was one of the fortunate ones . In 2004 , NPCA led an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for luxury homes on private land within the park ; soon after , Congress allocated $7.5 million to purchase the property . The properties neighboring Petrified Forest are n't at risk of imminent development , but artifacts , petrified wood , and other national treasures just beyond park boundaries remain at risk . " There are individuals who show up with backhoes , and dig the heck out of the land , " says Petrified Forest Superintendent Lee Baiza . " We fly the boundary twice a year , but if degradation is occurring on private property , we do n't have leeway to do much about it . " And so this park with permission to grow-but not the money that growth requires-is forced to bide its time . It 's difficult to estimate when Congress might appropriate the funds to the National Park Service , though Petrified Forest boasts good friends in high places : In October 2006 , Sen. Jon Kyl ( R-AZ ) and Rep. Rick Renzi ( R-AZ ) sent Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne a letter requesting $4 million for the park 's expansion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way into the 2008 budget . And even if it does , $4 million is only a drop in the bucket compared with the total expansion costs , estimated at $15 to $25 million . Clearly , the acquisitions will be piecemeal . Since the expansion was approved , speculators have busily begun subdividing some smaller parcels . For the Park Service , that means cutting deals with an evergrowing number of landowners . " One property has been subdivided from 40 acres down to 2.5-acre parcels over the last year-and-a-half , " says Baiza , adding that several properties have even been placed for bid on eBay . Amidst the rush of activity , simply estimating the value of the land becomes a nearly impossible task . " The appraisal process is a critical feetor in conservation purchases like these , and it can be incredibly complicated , " says Dave Nimkin , NPCA 's Southwest Regional director . " The question is , do you estimate the land 's value as raw land ? Is it the value as a natural resource ? As an archaeological treasure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't know the answer-that 's the dilemma that has turned this process into a nightmare for willing sellers . " Indeed , the day Congress authorizes a park expansion , the land is immediately less attractive to other potential buyers , though speculators might snatch it up with hopes of turning a quick profit or exchanging the land for government property closer to an urban area . But ranchers who want to sell to the government quickly find its appraisal process does n't generally account for the land 's archaeological significance . So although people like Mike Fitzgerald clearly want to do the right thing , they often get caught in the middle . Scott Higginson just wants to see the resources protected from thieves and vandals . Higginson is executive vice president for NZ Legacy , a company that owns property designated for the expansion , and he 's been negotiating with BLM for a 7,700-acre exchange . " Our objective is button it up , slam it shut , and get it to the federal government as quickly as we can , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those precious fossils and cultural remains . " There 's been a considerable amount of archaeological pilfering and illegal collecting on private and public land next to the park , " says Dr. David Gillette , curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff . Gillette has spent decades conducting research at Petrified Forest , and he says a price tag ca n't be placed on such destruction . " Those rocks contain fossils that record the time when all modern terrestrial ecosystems originated . The Chinle formation itself has global significance . " Those resources provide not only a learning tool for visitors , but an invaluable , open-air classroom . " I 'm a big advocate for this expansion , " he says . " This area could be an important tool for educating and training the next generation of scientists . " ( In fact , Guette has testified before Congress and penned an essay for National Parks magazine to that effect five years ago . ) Back at Twin Buttes Ranch , Mike Fitzgerald knows he 's taking a risk just by publicizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once , and the years of delays just leave him more concerned and more perplexed . " Everybody is in favor of the expansion , " he says . " So why wo n't Congress put in the money ? " He pauses , reaching down for a dinosaur bone . " We 're not trying to take advantage of the situation , " he says . " We 're only asking what the land is worth .

Sidebar Gettysburg 's Latest Battle When these Pennsylvania pastures were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody Civil War battle , few could have imagined that Gettysburg National Military Park would someday battle the creep of residential development . But that 's just what is happening , as this park struggles to preserve its historical integrity . Like Petrified Forest National Park , Gettysburg is awaiting appropriations from Congress to fulfill expansion plans approved back in 1990 . Those land purchases are vital , says park spokeswoman Katie Lawhon . " The boundary expansion resulted from extensive studies of properties related to the Battle of Gettysburg . But 17 years after the congressional authorization , we 're just slowly chipping away at our backlog of land acquisitions . " The issue gets more complicated as time passes . Consider that Gettysburg 's current boundary encompasses 5,989 acres . But within those borders are 1,144 acres not yet protected from development , comprising 86 different private parcels . " There 's everything from a one-half-acre piece of land with a ranch home on it to bigger properties , including farms that are between 80 and 90 acres each , " Lawhon says . That presents a nagging worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 Civil War cannons , 148 historic buildings , and more than 1,300 monuments draw 1.7 million visitors each year . The pressure on Gettysburg is growing , as commuters from Washington , D.C. , find it an increasingly attractive and affordable place to build homes . Even as Gettysburg struggles to protect the past , however , there have been victories . For example , The Gettysburg Foundation recently donated $1.2 million to purchase the site of Pickett 's Charge , where Union forces were attacked by 12,000 Confederate soldiers on July 3 , 1863 . A motel on that property has been removed , and the fields have been restored to contemplative quiet . " We 've even established a wayside exhibit talk about four soldiers who received medals of honor for fighting on that particular battlefield , " says Lawhon . " These places still have a great deal of meaning for Americans today .
