Jonas Brothers Lines , Vines and Trying Times 2 stars POP-ROCK The Jonas Brothers may still be good Disney boys , with a new series on the Mickey Mouse channel , but even they are n't going to take a Taylor Swift dis lying down . " I get a rep for breakin ' hearts/ Now I 'm done with superstars/ And all the tears on her guitar , " sings Joe Jonas on " Much Better , " a not-so-subtle dig at his country-star ex . It 's the dishiest -- and dreamiest -- moment on the trio 's fourth studio album . Despite a fresh infusion of horns , though , the new disc lacks the punch of last year 's A Little Bit Longer . And the JoBros ' other attempts at brandishing a little edge produce mixed results : The snarling attack of " World War III " works , but " Do n't Charge Me for the Crime "  - -  a cringe-worthy collaboration with rapper Common -- does n't . Holly Williams Here with Me 3 stars COUNTRY Her grandfather is Hank Williams and her dad is Hank Williams Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of the year 's best country albums . She addresses her family on " Mama , " about how her mother did n't let marital problems come between father and daughter . Elsewhere , she delivers a killer kiss-off on the rock-tinged " Keep the Change " : " I 've paid my dues , honey/ You can keep the change . " DOWNLOAD THIS : " Three Days in Bed , " a spare , aching ballad Diane Birch Bible Belt 3 stars CRITIC 'S CHOICE ALT-POP Move over , Amy , Adele and Duffy : The British blue-eyed-soul brigade gets some serious competition from this Yankee on her debut . Like her Brit counterparts , the singer-pianist has a retro vibe . She harks back to the ' 70s on the Laura Nyro-esque highlight " Nothing But a Miracle " and the ' 60s on " Choo Choo , " where the bluesy-voiced Birch gives Bible Belt some of that old gospel spirit .

" BOX QUICK CUTS RHETT MILLER Rhett Miller There 's an unassuming appeal to the fourth solo effort from the Old 97 's frontman , who keeps pop-rock charmers like " Caroline " short and simple . But there 's no shortage of catchiness and even a little cheekiness. 3 stars KASABIAN West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum Like its title , the third album from these Brit alt-rockers meanders a bit . Still , there are some standouts -- such as the anthemic " Where Did All the Love Go ? "  - -  along this psychedelic-tinged trip . 2 stars TEENA MARIE Congo Square Thirty years after her first album , Lady T is still proving that soul knows no color . Her latest is a sultry , sophisticated mix of R &B,; funk and jazz . Best is " Ca n't Last a Day , " her lush duet with Faith Evans . 3 stars MITCHEL MUSSO Mitchel Musso Respectable but unremarkable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation for Miley Cyrus 's musical chops . Even so , there is enough here to keep his tween fans happy . 2 stars BOX DEF LEPPARD 'S PHIL COLLEN FROM METAL TO MUSCLE * The guitarist -- whose band is up for two CMT Music Awards June 16  - -  dishes on working with country stars and shedding rock-star habits . ON GOING COUNTRY Working with Taylor Swift was cool . She was influenced by Shania Twain , whose ex Mutt Lange produced Def Leppard 's songs . And I know she 's more bluegrass , but I 'd like Alison Krauss to do our music . ON CLEAN LIVING I have n't had a drink in 22 years , and I 've been a vegetarian for 25 . I can box for 12 rounds . I could n't do that at age 20 . ON HIS TOUR DIET It 's tough when I want Doritos and it 's no carbs after 5 . So I eat tofu and raw chard . But chocolate is my downfall . ON HIS BODY THEN VS . NOW Mixed martial arts changed me . I was skinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still fit in my old clothes , but my chest pops the buttons ! ON TOURING THIS SUMMER I 'm stoked : We became uncool in the ' 90s , but now people are going nuts and swooning again .
