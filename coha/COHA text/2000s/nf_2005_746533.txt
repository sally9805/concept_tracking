" Global warming and sea-level rise are the most serious threats to the <p> Pacific region and the survival of some island states . "  --  Communiqu of the Twenty-Third South Pacific Forum , 1992 ( n1 ) <p> <p> " Sea-level rise and other related consequences of climate change are grave security threats to our very existence as homelands and nation-states. "  --  Leo A. Falcam , President of the Federated States of Micronesia , 2001 ( n2 ) <p> <p> Global forces often have had detrimental impacts on the Pacific islands . Colonization , island-scale phosphate mining , nuclear weapons testing , the Second World War , the Cold War , globalization and trade liberalization have all wrought significant political , economic and cultural changes in the region . Yet as the epigraphs to this article suggest , among all these global processes , perhaps the most dangerous to the Pacific islands is climate change . <p> Since the 1988 Toronto Conference , " The Changing Atmosphere : Implications for Global Security , " climate change has emerged as a major environmental security problem . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change will significantly alter the distribution and function of most of the world 's natural systems . Small islands have repeatedly been identified in science and climate policy discourse as natural systems particularly vulnerable to climate change . A growing body of research suggests that , given the ways in which island ecosystems are likely to change , social systems on small islands are at risk of significant stress due to climate change . This article assesses the consequences of climate change on the Pacific islands and explores the potential to mitigate and adapt to these effects . GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE <p> The earth 's climate is influenced by incoming and outgoing solar radiation , while the planet 's surface absorbs approximately half of the incoming solar energy , which leads to global warming . Some of this heat is re-emitted in the form of infrared radiation , but most is blocked by a blanket of greenhouse gases that keeps the planet some 34 Celsius warmer than it would be otherwise. ( n3 ) Heating of the earth is greatest along the equator , and the world 's general climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heat away from the equator and toward the poles . <p> Since the Industrial Revolution , human activities such as land clearing and the burning of oil and coal have increased the concentration of most greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . These emissions have thickened the blanket of greenhouse gases , trapping more of the outgoing infrared radiation , which warms the atmosphere , land and ocean surfaces . In turn , this warming creates a more vigorous redistribution of heat from the equator to the poles , leading to changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulations , weather patterns and the hydrological cycle that will continue into the future . <p> Much of what is known about climate change is compiled into five yearly reports issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . ( n4 ) In its 2001 Third Assessment Report , the IPCC concluded that during the 20th century , global average surface temperature had increased by 0.6 Celsius and sea levels rose 10-20 centimeters. ( n5 ) The IPCC argued that natural causes could not account for these changes and that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide ( CO 2 ) , to which fossil fuel combustion and cement production are major contributors , account for 64 percent of the enhanced green house effect . Since 1751 , these sources have been responsible for the release of roughly 290 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere , half of this total after the mid-1970s. ( n6 ) As a result , atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 have increased by 30 percent since 1750. ( n7 ) Land clearing , farming and deforestation are also major sources of greenhouse gas emissions . <p> As a consequence of greenhouse gas emissions , by the year 2100 , the global mean surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 to 5.8 Celsius , and the global mean sea level is projected to rise by 9 to 88 centimeters. ( n8 ) This projected rate of warming is seemingly without precedent over the past 10,000 years . The global hydrological cycle is likely to become more vigorous , with the prospect of intensified climatic extremes such as heatwaves , droughts and floods . The relationship between climate change and tropical cyclones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may become more pronounced in the future , meaning cyclones could last longer , exhibit higher wind speeds and unleash more rainfall. ( n9 ) <p> These changes in temperature , rainfall and sea level , as well as the exacerbation of extreme events , pose myriad risks to ecosystems and the people who depend on them . The nature of these risks differs according to the characteristics of ecological systems . Some ecosystems , as in the Arctic , are very sensitive to changes in temperature , while others , as in the Horn of Africa , are vulnerable to shifts in rainfall . Still others , like low-lying coasts of soft materials such as sand and silt , are very sensitive to sea-level rise . For example , a 45-centimeter rise in sea level will potentially result in a loss of 11 percent of Bangladesh 's territory , largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river delta. ( n10 ) <p> The degree to which people are vulnerable to ecosystem change depends on the extent to which they are dependent on them for their livelihoods ( e.g. , farmers are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ecosystems are sensitive to climate change and the society 's ability to cope with these adversities . The latter is a function of economic resources , technologies , information and skills ; the degree of social equity ; and the quality of governance . It generally follows , then , that low-income societies are more vulnerable to climate change than their wealthy counterparts . <p> Furthermore , there is a strong correlation between the a country 's wealth and its current and past levels of greenhouse gas emissions . For example , the United States , the world 's largest economy , is responsible for 30.3 percent of the CO 2 emitted between 1900 and 1999 . Over the same period , EU countries were responsible for 22.1 percent. ( n11 ) In 2002 , the five largest polluters in terms of total CO 2 emissions were the United States ( 24 percent of global emissions ) , China , Russia , India and Japan. ( n12 ) However , on a per capita basis , Australia , the United States , Germany , Russia and the United Kingdom are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , responsibility is not equally shared among all people in developed countries : Estimates indicate that between 1950 and 2000 , the wealthiest 10 percent of people in developed countries emitted 7.5 times more CO 2 than the poorest 10 percent and 155 times more CO 2 than the poorest 10 percent of people in developing countries. ( n14 ) In this respect , climate change is a global justice issue : The societies that are most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions are those who are least vulnerable because of their adaptive capacity conferred upon them by the wealth that they have generated through dirty industrial production. ( n15 ) CLIMATE CHANGE IN PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES <p> There are 22 island states and territories in the Central and South Pacific Ocean . These are often placed into three categories : Melanesia , composed of Fiji , New Caledonia , Papua New Guinea , the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu ; Polynesia , comprises American Samoa , the Cook Islands , French Polynesia , Niue , Pitcairn Island , Samoa , Tokelau , Tonga , Tuvalu and Wallis and Futuna ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Guam , Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Nauru , the Northern Marianas and Palau . <p> The combined population of all 22 entities is 8.6 million , of which 5.6 million reside in Papua New Guinea. ( n16 ) Population growth rates in many of these countries , particularly New Caledonia , Papua New Guinea , the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , are high , although in a few cases , such as the Cook Islands and Niue , populations are contracting . The Pacific islands contain some 20 percent of the world 's languages , the majority of which are concentrated in Papua New Guinea . <p> Across the region annual Gross National Income ( GNI ) is generally low ; in 2002 , GNI ranged from $15 million in Tuvalu to $2.8 billion in Papua New Guinea. ( n17 ) Generally , GNI per capita is similarly low , ranging from $530 in Papua New Guinea to $6,820 in Palau in 2002 . Kiribati , Samoa , the Solomon Islands , Tuvalu and Vanuatu are currently classified as least-developed countries ( LDCs ) . From 1996 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Solomon Islands , the Marshall Islands , Palau , Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea contracted. ( n18 ) Most of the smaller Polynesian and Micronesian economies continue to be heavily reliant on aid and remittances sent from migrants living overseas , largely in Australia , New Zealand and the United States . In terms of income generated entirely by the domestic economy , tourism is an important industry , especially for countries like Fiji and the Cook Islands . In addition , many Pacific island states receive income from licensing fees paid by foreign-operated fishing boats for access to their territorial waters . Thus , on the whole , most Pacific Islanders are low in income and heavily dependent on natural resources to meet their basic needs of fresh water , food and shelter . <p> The combined land mass of all countries in the region is 550,000 square kilometers , but the region commands a vast exclusive economic zone of some 30 million square kilometers. ( n19 ) The largest country is Papua New Guinea with a land area of 462,000 square kilometers , while the smallest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally large and mountainous with fertile soils and mineral resources . The Polynesian and Micronesian islands vary in type , ranging from smaller volcanic islands to low-lying coral atolls . The latter are the most vulnerable to sea-level rise ; Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Tokelau and Tuvalu are comprised entirely of such atolls . <p> Of the 22 political entities in the region , nine are fully independent , six are self governing and constitutionally independent , but with some form of association with either the United States or New Zealand , and seven are dependent territories either of France , the United States or New Zealand . These political associations are important variables in the likely responses to climate change as they shape possibilities for migration and aid . <p> The Pacific island countries also exhibit an array of environmental problems that increase their ecosystems ' vulnerability to the effects of climate change . These problems include : land degradation , such as soil nutrient depletion and soil loss ; deforestation due to logging for timber exports , clearing for agriculture and fuel-wood collection ; biodiversity losses across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depletion of freshwater resources as a result of saline incursions and contamination from urban , agricultural and industrial sources ; and coastal and marine degradation , including coastal erosion , coral loss and coral bleaching , contracting artisanal fisheries and pollution of lagoons. ( n20 ) It is important to note that the magnitude of resource use and pollution in the Pacific islands is far less than in developed and most developing countries . Instead , the issue is the sensitivity of many island systems to even small levels of environmental degradation . It is also important to note that these environmental problems stem from low levels of economic and human development as well as processes that seek to improve living standards in the islands . Thus , in pursuing economic development , Pacific Islanders have generated a level of environmental disturbance , which , in the absence of externally imposed climate change , would probably not have critical social and economic impacts . <p> The category of " Pacific islands " masks the considerable diversity in the environmental , economic , political and cultural characteristics therein . There are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that can heighten or reduce climatic risk factors . It follows , then , that the ways in which climate change affect each country are different , which means that discussions about its impacts on the Pacific islands must be read as generalizations masking significant variation . <p> Climate change and its macro-effects on temperature , rainfall , sea level and extreme events are likely to bring about localized changes in the coastal zone , agricultural systems , human settlements and infrastructure , water resources , human health and macroeconomic performance in Pacific island countries . Each of these areas deserves elaboration . <p> First , because most Pacific islands have a high ratio of coastline to land area , the potential impact of climate change in this zone is a critical issue for development planning . As previously mentioned , the risks are most acute in the case of atolls . The coastal zones of most Pacific islands consist of soft materials such as sand and sediments that are easily eroded by wave action . When protected by mangroves or extensive reef barriers , shorelines do not significantly erode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development in the coastal zone , the clearing of mangroves , the dumping of wastes and other polluting activities and the mining of beaches and reefs for building materials have all taken their toll on the natural resilience of coastal systems , and therefore increase the susceptibility of coastal systems to damage from sea-level rise and extreme events . These actions have also increased the susceptibility of reefs to coral bleaching in periods of rapid increases in sea-surface temperature , retarding reef growth . Thus , locally derived degradation of the coastal zone , coupled with climate stressors , indicate that in the future there may be increased coastal erosion due to changes in mean sea levels , greater wind speeds and associated high-energy waves . <p> This coastal degradation will result in increasing salt-water incursion into fresh water resources along the coastal zone , which in turn will affect plant productivity . More intense extreme events such as cyclones are also likely to take a toll on agricultural production . Cyclones are already a significant cause of lost production in many countries . In Fiji , for example , Cyclone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops in 2003 , and in Niue , Cyclone Heta caused approximately $4 million of damages to crops in 2004. ( n21 ) The vulnerability of agricultural production to cyclones is increased by shifting production from polycultural systems to monocultural cash crops , as the former systems are much less prone to damage from high winds and salt spray. ( n22 ) Should climate change result in extended periods of drought , then it , too , may impact agricultural production , given the almost complete absence of irrigation in the Pacific islands . <p> Such deleterious impacts on agriculture will likely diminish food security . The El Nio of 1997 and 1998 caused widespread drought and subsequent food shortages in the islands west of the international dateline ; agricultural losses in Fiji were valued at $65 million and some 260,000 people in Papua New Guinea suffered as a result of a depleted food supply. ( n23 ) Since food security in the region is also determined by fish supply , the islands are further at risk of artisanal fishery depletion from increased coral bleaching and local development as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n24 ) <p> Since the vast majority of Pacific Islanders live in the coastal zone and all capital cities are located on the coast , climate change is likely to have significant impacts on human settlements and infrastructure via coastal erosion ; contamination of fresh-water systems and damage from winds ; waves and storm surges during cyclones . The vulnerability of urban areas is exacerbated by high rates of rural-to-urban migration , which has exceeded the capacity of urban planners to provide adequate services , creating pockets of highly vulnerable squatter communities. ( n25 ) <p> Already , cyclones are immensely destructive to human settlements and infra structure in the Pacific islands . For example , when Cyclone Heta struck Niue in 2004 , 43 houses on the Aloft terrace , more than 25 meters above sea level , were destroyed by waves . In all , 90 percent of houses on the island were damaged in some way . Heta also completely destroyed the national hospital and national museum , moved a bulk-fuel storage tank off its base and caused widespread damage to roads , the wharf and telecommunications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to coastal communities . It has been estimated , for instance , that the cost of protecting the main commercial and government area of the Marshall Islands  --  which houses some 15,000 people , the government , water and power plants , two ports , a hospital and a community college  --  against a 1-meter rise in sea level may be in excess of four times the GDP of that country. ( n27 ) <p> In most Pacific islands , water resource infrastructure is minimal , generally limited to major urban centers . This includes piped water , water collection and storage systems , solid and liquid waste disposal systems to prevent contamination of water , and systems to treat water . Climate models suggest that there will be a small increase in mean annual rainfall in most Pacific island countries. ( n28 ) However , the intensity of rainfall events is expected to increase by some 20-30 percent ; in other words , rainfall will be heavier , but rainfall events will be less frequent. ( n29 ) This suggests that flooding events will increase in intensity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during more intense storms and storms surges . The models also suggest that there will be longer dry periods with significant public health impacts , such as increased rates of diarrhea that occur in times of reduced water supply. ( n30 ) <p> Overall , these changes in precipitation patterns are likely to increase water resource problems in most Pacific islands . Atolls are arguably most at risk since freshwater resources are limited to a shallow lens floating above a dense saline aquifer , and atolls possess a limited number of rainwater collection systems . Given these changes in precipitation patterns , rising sea levels , increasing salinization of the freshwater lens , and increased demand and production of wastes due to population growth and economic growth , it seems likely that there will be increased stresses on the water resources of atolls in the future . <p> The environmental and social changes that most likely will be affected by climate change also have implications for human health in the Pacific islands . Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns may alter important disease vectors , especially mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , is likely to cause a contraction of the cooler malaria-free zone in the highlands . There are also demonstrated positive correlations between temperature increases and diarrhea and between warmer sea-surface temperatures and ciguatera poisoning , an illness caused by toxic-fish consumption. ( n31 ) Heat stress and increased injuries and deaths from extreme heat-related events are also likely to result . A compounding health factor could be decreased food security based on declining agricultural production and decreased access to fish . Finally , health services in most Pacific island countries are ill-equipped , already struggling to cope with existing health problems and thus are unlikely to be able to adequately address the increased health burden of climate change . <p> In combination , the environmental and social impacts of climate change may have negative effects on the economies of Pacific island countries . The region 's main industries of tourism , agriculture and fisheries are all resource-based and sensitive to climate change . The World Bank estimates that by 2050 , damages from climate change could cost Tarawa atoll in Kiribati $8-16 million , or 17-34 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Viti Levu , could experience damages amounting to 2-4 percent of Fiji 's current GDP ( n32 ) Another study estimates that the economic impacts of climate change on Pacific island economies may be " so profound that they dwarf any strategic issue currently confronting a major peace-time economy . " ( n33 ) Impacts on tourism have yet to be seriously examined , but it is believed that the Industry may be affected both directly , for example through the loss of beaches , and indirectly , through milder winters in traditional markets that would reduce the incentives for tourism . Extreme events will also be increasingly costly for Pacific island economies , an issue of great concern given that drought , floods and storms already impact production in significant ways . The estimated cost of recovering from Cyclone Heta in Niue was more than three times Niue 's GDP. ( n34 ) <p> Climate change may have other significant secondary effects in key areas . For instance , not only farmers ' livelihoods , but also the livelihoods of those depending on agricultural production  --  such as input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk from climate change. ( n35 ) Developments in one sector may in turn impact others ; for example , rural decline can cause migration to urban areas , placing increased demand on urban services . If climate change results in economic contraction and higher unemployment , then the ability of states to provide important services such as education , health care and protective security may also weaken at precisely the moment that demand for these services increases . <p> While it is important to examine the risks of climate change , it is technically incorrect and morally negligent to suggest that nothing can be done to prevent these devastating consequences for Pacific island countries . Indeed , there are good reasons to think that they can adapt , providing that : a ) greenhouse gas emissions are reduced , such that the rate of climate change is slowed and ultimately stopped , and b ) they achieve a high level of domestic sustainability to promote social and ecological resilience . To this end , Pacific island countries need to achieve a degree of sustainability that no modern industrial country has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment which allows little room for error over an extremely short timeframe. ( n36 ) These two components of the solution are respectively known as " mitigation " and " adaptation , " and the efforts of Pacific island countries in both domains are discussed in more detail below . ACTION TO MITIGATE CLIMATE RISKS <p> The landmark 1992 Earth Summit resulted in three important multilateral environmental agreements , one of which was the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) . The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC , as stated in Article 2 , is " stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system " in a time frame " sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally , and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner . " The UNFCCC does not set legally binding emissions targets on countries . Since 1992 , the UNFCCC has been signed and ratified by 184 countries . <p> In 1997 , a protocol to UNFCCC was adopted , setting legally binding emission targets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed in Annex I. The emissions reductions that would be achieved by this " Kyoto Protocol " equal a 5 percent reduction of the main greenhouse gases below 1990 levels , to be achieved in the first commitment period from 2008 to 2012 . Thus far , 156 countries have signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol , including all but four of the Annex I countries. ( n37 ) The United States and Australia are two of the Annex I countries that have rejected the treaty indefinitely , arguing that it will exact relatively disproportionate costs to their economies . The Kyoto Protocol is a significant first step towards controlling greenhouse gas emissions . However , the reductions it is supposed to achieve by 2012 will do almost nothing to slow the rate of climate change ; the significance of the initial limitations , rather , is that a process toward change has begun . <p> For their part , the Pacific island countries have been actively engaged in climate negotiations since the lead-up to the Earth Summit . The Pacific island countries act within a larger group comprising 44 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they formed during the Second World Climate Conference in 1990 is known as the Alliance of Small Island States ( AOSIS ) ; its aim is to influence negotiations on environmental issues , and in particular climate change . AOSIS uses dialogue and negotiation to achieve its aims . In its efforts , the group is guided by clearly stated principles , including the principle of preventative action , the precautionary principle , the " polluter pays " principle , the duty to cooperate and the principle of equity . AOSIS pushes for strong emission-reduction commitments , strong monitoring and compliance measures in the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol and assistance for adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change . <p> AOSIS 's role in climate negotiations has been disproportionate relative to the size of its collective populations and economies , in part because 37 AOSIS members are members of the United Nations , and in part because they have exercised strong moral pressure on developed countries. ( n38 ) For example , AOSIS can claim some success in the ultimate form of the Kyoto Protocol through the way its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a 20 percent reduction in emissions , set a moral standard that arguably helped prevent a weaker protocol-which certain countries like Japan , Australia , the United States , Canada and New Zealand pushed for  --  from emerging . AOSIS has maintained moral pressure on developing countries to reduce greenhouse emissions through appeals to the UN General Assembly , partnerships with large nongovernmental organizations such as Greenpeace and speeches and lobbying in a broad range of international forums such as Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings and the World Summit on Sustainable Development. ( n39 ) AOSIS has also sought representation of Islanders in the staffing of key intergovernmental organizations. ( n40 ) <p> While small island states have demonstrated at least some influence in climate change negotiations , they do not wield a great deal of power , or at least not enough to produce the kinds of outcomes required to arrest climate change . Agreements arising from conferences of parties to the UNFCCC are for the most part based on the consensus of all parties due to a lack of agreement about the rules of procedure with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of vetoes , although sometimes a " consensus-minus-X " procedure is used so that objections can be overridden in final agreements . This has two implications for small island states . First , it takes a long time for decisions to be made , and most of the proposals supported by small island states are not adopted because of opposition from other parties . Second , because the Annex I countries account for 61.6 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and a similar share of global GDP , these more influential countries have more bargaining leverage . Meanwhile , small island states remain largely trivial emitters of greenhouse gases  --  the Pacific island countries combined produce less than 0.5 percent of global emissions  --  and they have virtually no economic influence ; since 1992 , debates have become increasingly dominated by Annex I countries seeking to equalize the costs and benefits of greenhouse gas reductions among themselves . As a result , the influence of small island states in negotiations has waned . <p> For the foreseeable future , rates of greenhouse gas emissions are unlikely to slow . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 have rendered a 5-12 centimeter rise in sea level by the year 2025 inevitable , and a sea-level rise of 14-32 centimeters by 2050 very likely. ( n41 ) For the Pacific island countries , this means that some degree of change is inescapable . Consequently , it is necessary to pursue some degree of action to adapt to these changes . ACTION TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE <p> The vulnerability of Pacific island countries to climate change is the product of the way climate interacts with local processes in social and environmental systems . While mitigation reduces the rate of climate change by reducing emissions , adaptation addresses local social and environmental issues that make climate change more challenging for a community . The technical definition of adaptation to climate change is " adjustments in **26;2425;TOOLONG systems in response to actual or expected climate stimuli , their effects or impacts . " ( n42 ) In essence , adaptation entails coping with climate change . There has yet to be any clear specification as to what constitutes successful adaptation , but one could posit that adaptation has failed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . <p> Action on adaptation in the Pacific islands occurs at global , regional , national and local levels . At the global level , several articles of the UNFCCC refer to the need for adaptation , including much of Article 4 . For example , Article 4.4 includes calls for " developed country Parties and other developed Parties to assist the developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects . " The most significant activity thus far has been the production of National Communications to the UNFCCC , as required under Article 12 , which nine Pacific island countries submitted , and which contained assessments of vulnerability and adaptation . Funding to assist in the preparation of these National Communications was channelled through the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , the financial mechanism for the UNFCCC , and two of its implementing agencies in the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the World Bank . <p> More recent developments include the creation in 2001 of a Special Climate Change Fund and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the creation of an adaptation fund to operate under the Kyoto Protocol. ( n43 ) The LDCF is assisting the countries of Kiribati , Samoa , the Solomon Islands , Tuvalu and Vanuatu to prepare National Adaptation Plans of Action . This preparation requires community-driven consultation to identify urgent adaptation needs , although there is not yet any funding to implement the needs that are identified . There are also moves toward a GEF-implemented Special Pilot Fund on Adaptation , which is likely to include a project in the Pacific region . For the most part , global-level support for adaptation in the Pacific islands has thus far taken the form of funding for projects that produce studies and reports and that conduct capacity-building . <p> There is also a significant amount of adaptation-related activity at the regional level . To achieve economies of scale , Pacific island countries have historically pooled their scarce resources to address common problems . There are a number of regional organizations engaged in such activities , including the University of the South Pacific , the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission , the Pacific Islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environment Programme ( SPREP ) . SPREP has been central to all climate change activities in the region and will take the leading role in future adaptation activities . It was the coordinating agency for the Pacific Islands Climate Change Assistance Programme ( PICCAP ) , which was a GEF/UNDP funded project that ran for four years from 1997 to 2001 . PICCAP has been the major climate change initiative in the Pacific region to date . Ultimately the project was successful , having implemented climate change country teams in 10 Pacific island countries , all but one of which produced National Communications . The country teams acted as focal points for climate change activities and were consisted of representatives from an array of ministries and emergency management agencies . However , the momentum built under PICCAP was lost when the project funding ended . In the absence of funding from national governments , most national climate change officers were forced to seek alternative employment and consequently most national country teams lost their coordinating member . <p> SPREP was also instrumental in the negotiation of the Pacific Island 's Framework for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rise , which exists to focus and guide all climate change-related science and policy in the region . More recently it has been the coordinating agency for the Capacity Building for the Development of Adaptation Measures in Pacific Island Countries ( CBDAMPIC ) project , which was funded by the Canada Climate Change Development Fund and conducted in the Cook Islands , Fiji , Samoa and Vanuatu. ( n44 ) The CBDAMPIC project implemented small-scale adaptation measures , including the relocation of a village in Vanuatu . <p> At the level of individual countries , national governments have provided policy support , basic facilities and in-kind staffing contributions for national climate change projects . However , they have rarely funded projects and staff directly As a result , for the most part , climate change adaptation activities occur in countries when , and for as long as , funding from global and regional sources is available . This situation arises for a combination of reasons : limited budgets ; a perception among decision makers that the only solution to climate change is for developed countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate problems take precedence over future ones like climate impacts . National adaptation is also limited by uncertainty about how to act . <p> Uncertainty confounds planning for adaptation to climate change . Even for those impacts that are reasonably expected to occur , their precise magnitude , timing and location remains uncertain . These basic uncertainties are compounded by a lack of knowledge about the functioning of individual ecosystems , patterns of causality and interaction both between ecosystems and these patterns , on the one hand , and between social and ecological systems , on the other . This makes predicting ecological and social responses impossible . Thus , governments are faced with the prospect of investing scarce resources in potentially expensive solutions to meet impacts that may not materialize and whose magnitude is uncertain. ( n45 ) The only rational adaptation strategy , then , is to develop a society 's general capacity to cope with change by building up its institutional structures and human resources while maintaining and enhancing the integrity of ecosystems . In other words , any activity towards ecologically sustainable human development can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that sustainable development is a growing priority for many governments in the region is encouraging . On the other hand , the GEF 's criteria for medium-and large-scale projects tend to favor discrete projects on clearly identified climate problems with demonstrated global benefits . This restricts the possibility of securing funding for more general sustainability activities and for activities which countries themselves see as priorities . <p> At the local level there are very few activities that are directly related to adaptation for climate change . However , a recent and notable development is the implementation of a GEF small-grants fund in Samoa , which is successfully funding environmental projects that enhance the adaptive capacity of local communities . Part of the reason for the success of the scheme is that , unlike the medium-and large-grant schemes , the criteria for funding are more amenable to local needs . The Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is also intended to fund community-level adaptation projects . <p> Nevertheless , at the local level adaptation is less a discrete activity and more an integral feature of life in most Pacific communities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide range of substantial exogenous and human-induced changes . They have done this through what anthropologist Marshall Sahlins has called the indigenization of modernity , where traditional systems incorporate the most suitable and useful aspects of modern society. ( n46 ) So , while most Pacific island communities do not have access to important resources such as money , modern technologies and infrastructure that aid adaptation , they do have well developed local institutions , resilient social systems , a sensitivity to environmental change and a high degree of equity , which are also important . Moreover , there are kinship-based transnational economic and social networks that facilitate human development through access to services in the developed countries in which expatriate family members live , as well as through financial transfers like remittances . Pacific Islanders are therefore not without considerable capacity to adapt to climate change  --  a point that is often lost in the vulnerability mantra of climate scientists and well-meaning environmental groups. ( n47 ) Nevertheless , the strengths and limits of this capacity and its effectiveness in the face of climate change are not well understood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been little direct action toward adaptation to climate change in the Pacific islands . Under the aegis of the UNFCCC , the international community has funded those discrete climate-related activities that have been implemented . This seems likely to be the case for as long as governments and local communities have limited resources and more pressing needs . There is , however , a host of national and local processes that promote human development and sustainability , enhancing adaptive capacity . Whether or not these are offsetting processes that enhance vulnerability is uncertain . What is more likely is that , in aggregate , there has been insufficient action to ensure that the Pacific islands will be unaffected by climate change . CONCLUSION <p> Despite being a common security problem , and despite the rapid development of an extensive global climate change regime in which all but a few countries participate , there has yet to be any substantive action on controlling climate change . This is perhaps because not all countries are equally responsible for , or vulnerable to , climate change . Subsequently , countries have vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For their part , the Pacific island countries require an effective climate change regime that delivers reductions in the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change . However , some degree of climate change is now inevitable , and so some degree of adaptation will have to take place . Most Pacific island societies have been generally successful in adapting to other global forces in ways that maintain the lifestyles that they value . Whether they can adapt to this latest challenge is unclear . <p> Climate change is a complex problem for policymakers . There are few direct actors and many indirect processes : a lack of discretely identifiable " climate change " events but a mixture of creeping , if not necessarily incremental , changes in mean conditions coupled with exacerbations of sudden hazards ; complex cascading effects through hierarchies of natural and social systems that can both exacerbate and mitigate impacts ; common but differentiated responsibilities and vulnerabilities arising from histories of development and underdevelopment ; and multiple and probably irreducible uncertainties . This complexity means that , contrary to the speculations of some sections of civil society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some Pacific island countries will become " Titanic states , " doomed to disappear beneath rising seas . Instead , the dangers can be substantially reduced through widespread and profound social changes in industrial economies that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions , coupled with a commitment from the international community and national governments to achieve sustainable human development . <p>
