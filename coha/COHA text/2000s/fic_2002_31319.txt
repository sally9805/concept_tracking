March 2000 Salem Falls , New Hampshire On the second worst day of Addie Peabody 's life , her refrigerator and dishwasher both died , like long-term lovers who could not conceive of existing without each other . This would have been a trial for anyone , but as she was the owner of the Do-Or-Diner , it blossomed into a catas-trophe of enormous proportions . Addie stood with her hands pressed to the stainless steel door of the Sub-Zero walk-in , as if she might jump-start its heart by faith healing . It was hard to decide what was more devastating : the health violations or the loss of potential income . Twenty pounds of dry ice , the most the medical supply store had to offer , was n't doing the job . Within hours , Addie would have to throw away the gallon buckets of gravy , stew , and chicken soup made that morning . " I think , " she said after a moment , " I 'm going to build a snowman . " " Now ? " asked Delilah , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . She frowned . " You know , Addie , I never believed it when folks around here called you crazy , but  --  " " I 'll stick it in the fridge . Maybe it 'll save the food until the repairman gets here . " " Snowmen melt , " Delilah said , but Addie could tell that she was turning the idea over in her mind . " Then we 'll mop up and make more . " " And I suppose you 're just gon na let the customers fend for themselves ? " " No , " Addie said . " I 'm going to get them to help . Will you get Chloe 's boots ? " The diner was not crowded for 10 A.M. Of the six booths , two were occupied : one by a mother and her toddler , the other by a businessman brushing muffin crumbs off his laptop . A couple of elderly regulars , Stuart and Wallace , slouched at the counter drinking coffee while they argued over the local paper 's headlines . " Ladies and gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce the start of the Do-or-Diner 's winter carnival . The first event is going to be a snow-sculpture contest , and if you 'd all just come out back for a moment , we can get started  --  " " It 's freezing out there ! " cried Wallace . " Well , of course it is . Otherwise we 'd be having a summer carnival . Winner of the contest gets ... a month of breakfast on the house . " Stuart and Wallace shrugged , a good sign . The toddler bounced on the banquette like popcorn in a skillet . Only the businessman seemed unconvinced . As the others shuffled through the door , Addie approached his table . " Look , " the businessman said . " I do n't want to build a snowman , all right ? All I came here for was some breakfast . " " Well , we 're not serving now . We 're sculpting . " She gave him her brightest smile . The man seemed nonplussed . He tossed a handful of change on the table , gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're nuts . " Addie watched him leave . " Yes , " she murmured . " That 's what they say . " Outside , Stuart and Wallace were huffing through their scarves , crafting a respectable armadillo . Delilah had fashioned a snow chicken , a leg of lamb , pole beans . The toddler , stuffed into a snowsuit the color of a storm , lay on her back making angels . Once Chloe had asked : Is Heaven above or below the place where snow comes from ? " You got the Devil 's own luck , " Delilah told Addie . " What if there was no snow ? " " Since when has there been no snow here in March ? And besides , this is n't luck . Luck is finding out the repairman could come a day early . " As if Addie had conjured it , a man 's voice called out . " Anybody home ? " " We 're back here . " Addie was faintly disappointed to see a young cop , instead of an appliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You here for a cup of coffee ? " " Uh , no , Addie . I 'm here on official business . " Her head swam . Could the accountant have reported them to the board of health so quickly ? Did a law enforcement officer have the power to make her close her doors ? But before she could voice her doubts , the policeman spoke again . " It 's your father , " Orren explained , blushing . " He 's been arrested . " Addie stormed into the police department with such force that the double doors slammed back on their hinges , letting in a gust of cold wind . " Jeez Louise , " said the dispatch sergeant . " Hope Courtemanche found himself a good hiding place . " " Where is he ? " Addie demanded . " My best guess ? Maybe in the men 's room , in a stall . Or squeezed into one of the empty lockers in the squad room . " The officer scratched his jaw . " Come to think of it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife was on the warpath . " " I 'm not talking about Officer Courtemanche , " Addie said through clenched teeth . " I meant my father . " " Oh , Roy 's in the lockup . " He winced , remembering something . " But if you 're here to spring him , you 're gon na have to talk to Wes anyway , since it was his arrest . " He picked up the phone . " You can take a seat , Addie . I 'll let you know when Wes is free . " Addie scowled . " I 'm sure I 'll know . You always smell a skunk before you see it . " " Why , Addie , is that any way to speak to the man who saved your father 's life ? " In his blue uniform , his badge glinting like a third eye , Wes Courtemanche was handsome enough to make women in Salem Falls dream about committing crimes . Addie , however , took one look at him and thought  --  not for the first time  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Arresting a sixty-five-year-old man is n't my idea of saving his life , " she huffed . Wes took her elbow and led her gently down the hall , away from the dispatch sergeant 's eyes and ears . " Your father was driving under the influence again , Addie . " Heat rose to her cheeks . Roy Peabody 's drinking was n't any secret in Salem Falls , but he 'd gone one step too far last month , wrapping his car around the town 's statue of Giles Corey , the only man who 'd been a casualty of the Puritan witch hunts . Roy 's license had been revoked . For his own safety , Addie had junked the car . And her own Mazda was safely parked at the diner . What vehicle could he have used ? As if he could read her mind , Wes said , " He was in the breakdown lane of Route 10 , on his ride-on mower . " " His ride-on mower , " Addie repeated . " Wes , that thing ca n't go more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's neither here nor there . The point is , he does n't have a license . And you need one if you 're gon na operate any self-propelled vehicle on the street . " " Maybe it was an emergency ... " " Guess it was , Addie . We confiscated a brand-new fifth of vodka from him , too . " Wes paused . " He was on his way home from the liquor store in North Haverhill . " He watched Addie knead her temples . " Is there anything I can do for you ? " " I think you 've done enough , Wes . I mean , gosh , you arrested a man joyriding on a lawn mower . Surely they 'll give you a Purple Heart or something for going to such extremes to ensure public safety . " " Now , just a second . I was ensuring safety ... Roy 's . What if a truck cut the curve too tight and ran him down ? What if he fell asleep at the wheel ? " " Can I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made Addie feel like he was sorting through her mind , opening up certain ideas and shuffling aside others . She closed her eyes . " Sure , " Wes said . " Follow me . " He led her down a hallway to a room at the back of the police department . There was a wide desk manned by another officer , a high counter with ink pads for fingerprinting , and in the shadowy distance , a trio of tiny cells . Wes touched her forearm . " I 'm not going to write him up , Addie . " " You 're a real prince . " He laughed and walked off . She heard the barred door slide open like a sword being pulled from its scabbard . " Guess who 's waiting for you out there , Roy ? " Her father 's voice now , pouring slow as honey : " My Margaret ? " " ' Fraid not . Margaret 's been gone about five years now . " They turned the corner , Wes bearing the brunt of her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , with hair as white and thick as the inner wing of a dove and blue eyes that always swam with a secret . " Addie ! " he crowed , seeing her . " Happy birthday ! " He lunged for her , and Addie staggered . " Come on , Dad . We 'll get you home . " Wes hooked his thumb on his belt . " You want a hand getting him out to your car ? " " No , thanks . We can manage . " At that moment , her father felt slighter and more insubstantial than Chloe . They walked awkwardly , like contestants in a three-legged race . Wes held open the door . " Well , shoot , Addie . I 'm sorry I had to call you down for this on your birthday . " She did not break stride . " It 's not my birthday , " she said , and guided her father out . At 6:30 that morning , Gillian Duncan had lit a match and waved a thermometer through it , spiking a temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to school . She spent the morning in her bedroom instead , listening to Alanis Morissette , braiding her long red hair , and painting her fingernails and toenails electric blue . In spite of the fact that she was seventeen years old and could fend for herself , her father had taken the day off from work to be with her . It raised her hackles and secretly pleased her all at once . As the owner of Duncan Pharmaceuticals , the biggest employer in Salem Falls , Amos Duncan was generally re-garded as one of its richest and busiest citizens . But then , he had always had time to take care of her ; he 'd been doing it since Gilly was eight and her mother had died . She was going crazy in her room and was about to do something really drastic , like pick up a textbook , when the doorbell rang . Listening closely , Gilly heard the voices of her friends downstairs . " Hi , Mr. D , " said Meg . " How 's Gillian ? " Before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jellybeans . My mom says they soak up a fever , and if they do n't , they taste so good you do n't care . " " We brought her homework , too , " Chelsea added . Painfully tall , self-conscious , and shy , she was one of Gilly 's newest friends . " Well , thank God you 're all here , " her father said . " I have a hard time recognizing Gilly unless she 's glued to the three of you . Just let me see if she 's awake . " Gilly dove beneath the covers , trying desperately to look sick . Her father cracked open the door and peered inside . " You up for company , Gilly ? " Rubbing her eyes , Gillian sat up . " Maybe for a little while . " He nodded , then called out to the girls . Meg led the charge up to Gillian 's room , a hail of Skechers pounding up the stairs . " I think my whole home could fit in this room , " Chelsea breathed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whitney said . " This is the first time you 've been to the manor . " Gillian slanted a look at her father . It was a common joke in town that the reason the Duncan home sat to the east whereas all the other roads and developments sat to the west was because Amos had wanted a palace separate and apart for his kingdom . " Yes , " Amos said , with a straight face . " We 're putting in a drawbridge this spring . " Chelsea 's eyes widened . " For real ? " Whitney laughed . She liked Gillian 's dad ; they all did . He knew how to make a teenager feel perfectly welcome . " If you guys tire her out , " Amos said , " I 'll make you dig the moat . " He winked at Chelsea , then pulled the door closed behind him . The girls wilted onto the carpet , lilies floating on a pond . " So ? " Meg asked . " Did you watch Passions ? " Meg Saxton had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up , she had n't lost her baby fat , and her brown hair flew away from her face in a riot of curls . " I did n't watch any soaps . I took a nap . " " A nap ? I thought you were faking . " Gillian shrugged . " I 'm not faking ; I 'm method-acting . " " Well , FYI , the trig test sucked , " Whitney said . The only child of one of the town selectmen , Whitney O'Neill was nothing short of a knockout . She 'd opened the bag of jellybeans to help herself . " Why ca n't we write a spell to get A 's ? " Chelsea looked nervously at the large , lovely bedroom , then at Gillian . " Are you sure we can do magick here , with your father right downstairs ? " Of course they could  --  and would  --  do magick . They had been students of the Craft for nearly a year now ; it was why they had gathered this afternoon . " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay , " Gillian said , withdrawing a black-and-white composition notebook from between the mattress and box spring . Written in bubble letters , with smiley-face O 's , was its title : Book of Shadows . She got out of bed and padded into the large adjoining bathroom . The others could hear her turning on the faucet , and then she returned with an eight-ounce glass of water . " Here , " she said , handing it to Whitney . " Drink . " Whitney took a sip , then spat on the floor . " This is disgusting ! It 's salt water ! " " So ? " Gillian said . As she spoke , she walked around her friends , sprinkling more salt onto the carpet . " Would you rather waste time taking a bath ? Or maybe you 've got a better way to purify yourself ? " Grimacing , Whitney drank again , and then passed it to the others . " Let 's do something quick today , " Meg suggested . " My mom will kill me if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across from Gillian on the floor , as Whitney and Chelsea made up the other corners of their square . Gillian reached for Whitney 's hand , and a cold draft snaked in through a crack in the window . As Whitney 's palm skimmed over Meg 's , the lamp on the nightstand dimmed . The pages of the notebook fluttered as Meg reached for Chelsea . And when Chelsea clasped Gillian 's hand , the air grew too thick to breathe . " What color is your circle ? " Gillian asked Chelsea . " It 's blue . " " And yours ? " Meg 's eyes drifted shut . " Pink . " " Mine 's silver , " Whitney murmured . " Pure gold , " Gillian said . All of their eyes were closed now , but they had learned over the course of the past year that you did not need them open to see . The girls sat , their minds winnowed to this point of power ; as one snake of color after another surrounded them , plaited into a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Delilah said with a sigh , as Addie hauled Roy Peabody into the kitchen . " I do n't need this from you now . " Addie gritted her teeth as her father stumbled heavily on the arch of her foot . " Is that Delilah ? " Roy crowed , craning his neck . " Prettiest cook in New Hampshire . " Addie managed to push her father into a narrow stairwell that led upstairs to his apartment . " Did Chloe give you any trouble ? " she called back over her shoulder . " No , honey , " Delilah sighed . " No trouble whatsoever . " Through sheer will , Addie and Roy made it upstairs . " Why do n't you sit down , Daddy ? " she said softly , guiding him to the frayed armchair that had stood in that spot all of Addie 's life . She could smell the stew that Delilah had prepared for the lunch rush rising through the floor and the weave of the carpet  --  carrots , beef base , thyme . As a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooted it in her system , making it as much as part of her as her blood or her bones . Her father had been like that , too , once . But it had been seven years since he 'd voluntarily set foot behind the stove . She wondered if it caused him the same phantom pain that came from losing a vital limb  --  if he drank to dull the ache of it . Addie crouched down beside his chair . " Daddy , " she whispered . Roy blinked . " My girl . " Tears sprang to her eyes . " I need you to do me a favor . The diner , it 's too busy for me to take care of . I need you  --  " " Oh , Addie . Do n't . " " Just the register . You wo n't ever have to go into the kitchen . " " You do n't need me to work the register . You just want to keep tabs on me . " Addie flushed . " That 's not true . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own and squeezed . " Every now and then it 's nice to know that someone cares where I am . " Addie opened her mouth to say the things she should have said years ago to her father , all those months after her mother 's death when she was too busy keeping the diner afloat to notice that Roy was drowning , but the telephone interrupted her . Delilah was on the other end . " Get down here , " the cook said . " Your bad day ? It just got worse . " " Did you say something ? " The cab driver 's eyes met Jack 's in the rearview mirror . " No . " " This look familiar yet ? " Jack had lied to the driver  --  what was one more lie in a long string of others ?  --  confessing that he could n't remember the name of the town he was headed toward but that Route 10 ran right through its middle . He would recognize it , he said , as soon as Main Street came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window . They were driving through a village , small but well-heeled , with a New England steepled white church and women in riding boots darting into stores to run their errands . It reminded him too much of the prep-school town of Loyal , and he shook his head . " Not this one , " he said . What he needed was a place where he could disappear for a while  --  a place where he could figure out how to start all over again . Teaching  --  well , that was out of the question now . But it was also all he 'd ever done . He 'd worked at Westonbrook for four years ... an awfully big hole to omit in a job interview for any related field . And even a McDonald 's manager could ask him if he 'd ever been convicted of a crime . Lulled by the motion of the taxi , he dozed off . He dreamed of an inmate he 'd worked with on farm duty . Aldo 's girlfriend would commute to Haverhill and leave treasures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . Once , she set herself up naked on a blanket , waiting for Aldo to come over on the tractor . " Drive slow , " Aldo would say , when they went out to harvest . " You never know what you 're going to find . " " Salem Falls coming up , " the cab driver announced , waking him . A hand-lettered blue placard announced the name of the town and proclaimed it home of Duncan Pharmaceuticals . The town was built outward from a central green , crowned by a memorial statue that listed badly to the left , as if it had been rammed from the side . A bank , a general store , and a town office building were dotted along the green  --  all neatly painted , walks shoveled clear of snow . Standing incongruously at the corner was a junked railroad car . Jack did a double take , and as the cab turned to follow the one-way road around the green , he realized it was a diner . In the window was a small sign . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " Harlan Pettigrew sat at the counter , nursing a bowl of stew . A napkin was tucked over his bow tie , to prevent staining . His eyes darted around the diner , lighting on the clock . Addie pushed through the swinging doors . " Mr. Pettigrew , " she began . The man blotted his mouth with his napkin and got to his feet . " It 's about time . " " There 's something I need to tell you first . You see , we 've been having a little trouble with some of our appliances . " Pettigrew 's brows drew together . " I see . " Suddenly the door opened . A man in a rumpled sports jacket walked in , looking cold and lost . His shoes were completely inappropriate for the season and left small puddles of melting snow on the linoleum floor . When he spotted her pink apron , he started toward her . " Excuse me  --  is the owner in ? " His voice made Addie think of coffee , deep and dark and rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That would be me . " " Oh . " He seemed surprised by this . " Okay . Well . I , um , I 'm here because  --  " A wide smile spread over Addie 's face . " Because I called you ! " She shook his hand , trying not to notice how the man froze in shock . " I was just telling Mr. Pettigrew , here , from the board of health , that the repairman was on his way to fix our refrigerator and dishwasher . They 're right through here . " She began to tug the stranger into the kitchen , with Pettigrew in their wake . " Just a moment , " the inspector said , frowning . " You do n't look like an appliance repairman . " Addie tensed . The man probably thought she was insane . Well , hell . So did the rest of Salem Falls . The woman was insane . And God , she 'd touched him . She 'd reached right out and grabbed his hand , as if that were normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than eight months since a woman 's skin had come in contact with his own . If she was covering something up from the board of health , then the diner was probably violating a code . He started to back away , but then the woman bowed her head . It was that , the giving in , that ruined him . The part in her dark hair was crooked and pink as a newborn 's skin . Jack almost reached out one finger and touched it but stuffed his hands in his pockets instead . He knew better than anyone that you could not trust a woman who said she was telling the truth . But what if you knew , from the start , that she was lying ? Jack cleared his throat . " I came as quickly as I could , ma'am , " he said , then glanced at Pettigrew . " I was paged from my aunt 's birthday party and did n't stop home to get my uniform . Where are the broken appliances ? " The kitchen looked remarkably similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequoia of a woman standing behind the grill and tried desperately to remember any technical trivia he could about dishwashers . He opened the two rolled doors , slid out the tray , and peered inside . " Could be the pump ... or the water inlet valve . " For the first time , he looked directly at the owner of the diner . She was small and delicate in build , no taller than his collarbone , but had muscles in her arms built , he imagined , by many a hard day 's labor . Her brown hair was yanked into a knot at the back of her head and held in place by a pencil , and her eyes were the unlikely color of peridot  --  a stone , Jack recalled , the ancient Hawaiians believed to be the tears shed by the volcano goddess . Those eyes , now , seemed absolutely stunned . " I did n't bring my toolbox , but I can have this fixed by ... " He pretended to do the math , trying to catch the woman 's eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced . " Now what 's the problem with the fridge ? " Pettigrew looked from the owner of the diner to Jack , and then back again . " There 's no point in checking out the rest of the kitchen when I have to return anyway , " he said . " I 'll come by next week to do my inspection . " With a curt nod , he let himself out . The owner of the diner launched herself across the line , embracing the cook and whooping with delight . Radiant , she turned to Jack and extended her hand ... but this time , he moved out of the way before she could touch him . " I 'm Addie Peabody , and this is Delilah Piggett . We 're so grateful to you . You certainly sounded authentic . " Suddenly , she paused , an idea dawning . " You do n't actually know how to fix appliances , do you ? " " No . That was just some stuff I heard in the last place I worked . " He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in to ask about the HELP WANTED sign . " The cook beamed . " You 're hired . " " Delilah , who died and left you king ? " She smiled at Jack . " You 're hired . " " Do you mind if I ask what the job is ? " " Yes . I mean , no , I do n't mind . We 're in the market for a dishwasher . " A reluctant grin tugged at Jack 's mouth . " I heard . " " Well , even if we fix the machine , we 'll still need someone to run it . " " Is it full time ? " " Part time ... afternoons . Minimum wage . " Jack 's face fell . He had a Ph.D . in history , and was applying for a job that paid $5.15 per hour . Misinterpreting his reaction , Delilah said , " I 've been asking Addie to hire a prep cook a while now . That would be a part-time morning job , would n't it ? " Addie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , Mr .... " " St. Bride . Jack . And yeah , I have . " He did n't say where the kitchen was , or that he 'd been a guest of the state at the time . " That beats the last guy you hired , " Delilah said . " Remember when we found him shooting up over the scrambled eggs ? " " It 's not like he mentioned his habit at the interview . " Addie turned to Jack . " How old are you ? " Ah , this was the moment  --  the one where she 'd ask him why a man his age would settle for menial work like this . " Thirty-one . " She nodded . " If you want the job , it 's yours . " No application , no references , no questions about his past employment . And anonymity  --  no one would ever expect to find him washing dishes in a diner . For a man who had determined to put his past firmly behind him , this situation seemed too good to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack managed . " Then grab an apron , " said his new boss . Suddenly , he remembered that there was something he needed to do , if Salem Falls was going to become his new residence . " I need about an hour to run an errand , " he said . " No problem . It 's the least I can do for the person who saved me . " Funny , Jack thought . I was thinking the same thing . Detective-Lieutenant Charlie Saxton fiddled with the radio in his squad car for a few moments , then switched it off . He listened to the squelch of slush under the Bronco 's tires and wondered , again , if he should have stayed with the Miami Police Department . It was a hard thing to be a law enforcement officer in the town where you 'd once grown up . You 'd walk down the street , and instead of noticing the IGA , you 'd remember the storeroom where a local teen had knifed his girlfriend . You 'd pass the school playground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town selectmen . Where everyone else saw the picture-perfect New England town of their youth , you saw the underbelly of its existence . His radio crackled as he turned onto Main Street . " Saxton . " " Lieutenant , there 's some guy here insisting he 'll talk only to you . " Even with the bad reception , Wes sounded pissed . " He got a name ? " " If he does , he is n't giving it up . " Charlie sighed . For all he knew , this man had committed murder within town lines and wanted to confess . " Well , I 'm driving into the parking lot . Have him take a seat . " He swung the Bronco into a spot , then walked in to find his guest cooling his heels . Literally . Charlie 's first thought , pure detective , was that the guy could n't be from around here  --  no one who lived in New Hampshire was stupid enough to wear a sports jacket and dress shoes in the freezing slush of early March . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent victim of a crime , or nervous , like a perp . No , he just looked like a guy who 'd had a lousy day . Charlie extended his hand . " Hi there . Detective-Lieutenant Saxton . " The man did n't identify himself . " Could I have a few minutes of your time ? " Charlie nodded , his curiosity piqued . He led the way to his office , and gestured to a chair . " What can I do for you , Mr .... " " Jack St. Bride . I 'm moving to Salem Falls . " " Welcome . " Ah , it all was falling into place . This was probably some family man who wanted to make sure the locale was safe enough for his wife and kids and puppy . " Great place , great town . Is there something in particular I can help you with ? " For a long moment , St. Bride was silent . His hands flexed on his knees . " I 'm here because of 651-B , " he said finally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft-spoken man was talking about a legal statute that required certain criminals to report in to a local law enforcement agency for ten years or for life , depending on the charge for which they had been convicted . Charlie schooled his features until they were as blank as St. Bride 's , until it was clear that his former words of welcome had been rescinded . Then he pulled from his desk drawer the state police 's form to register a sexual offender.
