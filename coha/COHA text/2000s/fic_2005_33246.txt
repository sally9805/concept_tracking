Chapter One Murder was always an insult , and had been since the first human hand had smashed a stone into the first human skull . But the murder , bloody and brutal , of an entire family in their own home , in their own beds , was a different form of evil . Eve Dallas , NYPSD Homicide , pondered it as she stood studying Inga Snood , forty-two-year-old female . Domestic , divorced . Dead . Blood spatter and the scene itself told her how it must have been . Snood 's killer had walked in the door , crossed to the bed , yanked Snood 's head up-probably by the mid-length blonde hair , raked the edge of the blade neatly-left to right-across her throat , severing the jugular . Relatively tidy , certainly quick . Probably quiet . It was unlikely the victim had the time to comprehend what was happening . No defensive wounds , no other trauma , no signs of struggle . Just blood and the dead . Eve had beaten both her partner and Crime Scene to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black-and-white on neighborhood patrol . The uniforms had called in the homicides , and she 'd gotten the tag just before three in the morning . She still had the rest of the dead , the rest of the scenes , to study . She stepped back out , glanced at the uniform on post in the kitchen . " Keep this scene secure . " " Yes , sir , Lieutenant . " She moved through the kitchen out into a bisected space-living on one side , dining on the other.Upper-middle income , single-family residence . Nice , Upper West Side neighborhood . Decent security , which had n't done the Swishers or their domestic a damn bit of good . Good furniture-tasteful , she supposed . Everything neat and clean and in what appeared to be its place . No burglary , not with plenty of easily transported electronics . She went upstairs , came to the parents ' room first . Keelie and Grant Swisher , ages thirty-eight and forty , respectively . As with their housekeeper , there was no sign of struggle . Just two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now dead . She gave the room a quick glance , saw a pricey man 's wrist unit on a dresser , a pair of woman 's gold earrings on another . No , not burglary . She stepped back out just as her partner , Detective Delia Peabody , came up the steps . Limping-just a little . Had she put Peabody back on active too soon ? Eve wondered . Her partner had taken a serious beating only three weeks before after being ambushed steps outside her own apartment building . And Eve still had the image of the stalwart Peabody bruised , broken , unconscious in a hospital bed . Best to put the image , and the guilt , aside . Best to remember how she herself hated being on medical , and that work was sometimes better than forced rest . " Five dead ? Home invasion ? " Huffing a bit , Peabody gestured down the steps . " The uniform on the door gave me a quick run . " " It looks like , but we do n't call it yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in bed , throat slit . Owners in there . Same pattern . Two kids , girl and boy , in the other rooms on this level . " " Kids ? Jesus . " " First on scene indicated this was the boy . " Eve moved to the next door , called for the lights . " Records ID twelve-year-old Coyle Swisher . " There were framed sports posters on his walls . Baseball taking the lead . Some of his blood had spewed onto the torso of the Yankees current hot left fielder . Though there was the debris of an adolescent on the floor , on the desk and dresser , she saw no sign Coyle had had any more warning than his parents . Peabody pressed her lips together , cleared her throat . " Quick , efficient , " she said in flat tones . " No forced entry . No alarms tripped . Either the Swishers neglected to set them - and I would n't bet on that-or somebody had their codes or a good jammer . Girl should be down here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's harder when it 's kids . " " It 's supposed to be . " Eve stepped to the next room , called for lights , and studied the fluffy pink and white bed , the little girl with her blonde hair matted with blood . " Nine-year-old Nixie Swisher , according to the records . " " Practically a baby . " " Yeah . " Eve scanned the room , and her head cocked . " What do you see , Peabody ? " " Some poor kid who 'll never get the chance to grow up . " " Two pair of shoes over there . " " Kids , especially upper income , swim in shoes . " " Two of those backpack deals kids haul their stuff in . You seal up yet ? " " No , I was just- " " I have . " Eve walked into the crime scene , reached down with a sealed hand , and picked up the shoes . " Different sizes . Go get the first on scene . " With the shoes still in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child , as Peabody hurried out . Then she set them aside , took an Identi-pad out of her field kit . Yes , it was harder when it was a child . It was hard to take such a small hand in yours . Such a small , lifeless hand , to look down at the young who 'd been robbed of so many years , and all the joys , all the pains that went in them . She pressed the fingers to the pad , waited for the readout . " Officer Grimes , Lieutenant , " Peabody said from the doorway . " First on scene . " " Who called this in , Grimes ? " Eve asked without turning around . " Sir , unidentified female . " " And where is this unidentified female ? " " I ... Lieutenant , I assumed it was one of the vics . " She glanced back now , and Grimes saw the tall , lean woman in mannish trousers , a battered leather jacket . The cool brown eyes , flat cop 's eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like her eyes , short , choppy rather than sleek . She had a rep , and when that icy gaze pinned him , he knew she 'd earned it . " So our nine-one-one calls in murder , then hops into bed so she can get her throat slashed ? " " Ah ... " He was a beat cop , with two years under his belt . He was n't ranking Homicide . " The kid here might 've called it , Lieutenant , then tried to hide in bed . " " How long you had a badge , Grimes ? " " Two years-in January . Lieutenant . " " I know civilians who 've got a better sense of crime scene than you . Fifth victim , identified as Linnie Dyson , age nine , who is not a fucking resident of this fucking address . Who is not one Nixie Swisher . Peabody , start a search of the residence . We 're looking for another nine-year-old girl , living or dead . Grimes , you idiot , call in an Amber Alert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abduction . Move ! " Peabody snagged a can of Seal-It out of her own kit , hurriedly sprayed her shoes and hands . " She could be hiding . If the kid called it in , Dallas , she could be hiding . She could be afraid to come out , or she 's in shock . She could be alive . " " Start downstairs . " Eve dropped on her hands and knees to look under the bed . " Find out what unit , what ' link placed the nine-one-one . " " On that . " Eve strode to the closet , searched through it , pushed into any area of the room where a child might hide . She started out , moving toward the boy 's room , then checked herself . You were a little girl , with what seemed to be a nice family . Where did you go when things got bad ? Somewhere , Eve thought , she herself never had to go . Because when things got bad for her , the family was the cause . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . " Nixie , " she said quietly , as her eyes scanned . " I 'm Lieutenant Dallas , with the police . I 'm here to help you . You call the police , Nixie ? " Abduction , she thought again . But why slaughter an entire household to snatch a little girl ? Easier to boost her off the street somewhere , even to come in , tranq her , carry her out . More likely they 'd found her trying to hide , and she 'd be curled up somewhere , dead as the rest . She called for lights , full , and saw the smears of blood on the carpet on the far side of the bed . A small , bloody handprint , another , and a trail of red leading to the master bath . Did n't have to be the kid 's blood . More likely the parents . More likely , but there was a hell of a lot of it . Crawled through the blood , Eve thought . The tub was big and sexy , double sinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal for the toilet . A smudged and bloody swath stained the pretty pastel floor tiles . " Goddamn it , " Eve mumbled , and followed the trail toward the thick , green glass walls of a shower station . She expected to find the bloodied body of a small dead girl . Instead she found the trembling form of a live one . There was blood on her hands , on her nightshirt , on her face . For a moment , one hideous moment , Eve stared at the child and saw herself . Blood on her hands , her shirt , her face , huddled in a freezing room . For that moment , she saw the knife , still dripping , in her hand , and the body-the man-she 'd hacked to pieces lying on the floor . " Jesus . Oh Jesus . " She took a stumbling step back , primed to run , to scream . And the child lifted her head , locked glassy eyes on hers , and whimpered . She came back , hard , as if someone had slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought to get her breathing under control . Nothing like me . Nixie Swisher . She has a name . Nixie Swisher . " Nixie Swisher . " Eve said it out loud , and felt herself settle . The kid was alive , and there was a job to do . One quick survey told Eve none of the blood was the child 's . Even with the punch of relief , the stiffening of spine , she wished for Peabody . Kids were n't her strong suit . " Hey . " She crouched , carefully tapped the badge she 'd hooked to her waistband with a finger that was nearly steady now . " I 'm Dallas . I 'm a cop . You called us , Nixie . " The child 's eyes were wide and glazed . Her teeth chattered . " I need you to come with me , so I can help you . " She reached out a hand , but the girl cringed back and made a sound like a trapped animal . Know how you feel , kid . Just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody 's going to hurt you . " Keeping one hand up , she reached in her pocket with the other for her communicator . " Peabody , I 've got her . Master bath . Get up here . " Wracking her brain , Eve tried to think of the right approach . " You called us , Nixie . That was smart , that was brave . I know you 're scared , but we 're going to take care of you . " " They killed , they killed , they killed ... " " They ? " Her head shook , like an old woman with palsy . " They killed , they killed my mom . I saw , I saw . They killed my mom , my dad . They killed- " " I know . I 'm sorry . " " I crawled through the blood . " Eyes huge and glassy , she held out her smeared hands . " Blood . " " Are you hurt , Nixie ? Did they see you ? Did they hurt you ? " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , Nixie screamed as if she 'd been stabbed . And launched herself into Eve 's arms . Peabody stopped short , kept her voice very calm , very quiet . " I 'll call Child Protection . Is she injured ? " " Not that I can see . Shocky , though . " It felt awkward holding a child , but Eve wrapped her arms around Nixie and got to her feet . " She saw it . We 've got not only a survivor , but an eye witness . " " We 've got a nine-year-old kid who saw- " Peabody spoke in undertones as Nixie wept on Eve 's shoulder , and jerked her head toward the bedroom . " I know . Here , take her and- " But when Eve tried to peel Nixie away , the child only wrapped herself tighter . " I think you 're going to have to . " " Hell . Call CPS , get somebody over here . Start a record , room by room . I 'll be back in a minute . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms , but Nixie seemed glued to her now . Resigned , and wary , she carted Nixie down to the first floor , looked for a neutral spot , and settled on what looked like a playroom . " I want my mom . I want my mom . " " Yeah , I got that . But here 's the thing : You 've got to let go . I 'm not going to leave you , but you got ta loosen the grip . " " Are they gone ? " Nixie pushed her face into Eve 's shoulder . " Are the shadows gone ? " " Yes . You have to let go , sit down here . I have to do a couple of things . I need to talk to you . " " What if they come back ? " " I wo n't let them . I know this is hard . The hardest . " At wit 's end , she sat on the floor with Nixie still clinging to her . " I need to do a job , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus . " I need to get a sample from your hand , and then you can clean up . You 'd feel better if you got cleaned up , right ? " " I got their blood ... " " I know . Here , this is my field kit . I 'm just going to take a swab for evidence . And I need to take a recording . Then you can go to the washroom over there and clean up . Record on , " Eve said , quietly , then eased Nixie back . " You 're Nixie Swisher , right ? You live here ? " " Yeah , I want- " " And I 'm Lieutenant Dallas . I 'm going to swab your hand here , so you can clean up . It wo n't hurt . " " They killed my mom and my dad . " " I know . I 'm sorry . Did you see who they were ? How many there were ? " " I have their blood on me . " Sealing the swab , Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a little girl , covered in blood not her own . " How about you wash up ? " " I ca n't . " " I 'll help you . Maybe you want a drink or something . I can- " And when Nixie burst into tears , Eve 's eyes began to ache . " What ? What ? " " Orange Fizzy . " " Okay , I 'll see if- " " No , I went down to get one . I 'm not supposed to , but I went down to get one , and Linnie did n't want to wake up and come . I went down to the kitchen , and I saw . " With blood smeared on both of them now , Eve decided washing up would have to wait . " What did you see , Nixie ? " " The shadow , the man , who went into Inga 's room . I thought ... I was going to watch , just for a minute , if they were going to do it , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't supposed to , but I did , and I saw ! " There were tears and snot as well as blood on the kid 's face now . With nothing else handy , Eve pulled a wipe rag out of her field kit and passed it over . " What did you see ? " " He had a big knife and he cut her , he cut her bad . " She closed her own hand over her throat . " And there was blood . " " Can you tell me what happened then ? " As the tears gushed , she rubbed the wipe and her hands over her cheeks , smearing them with blood . " He left . He did n't see me , and he left and I got Inga 's ' link and I called Emergency . " " That 's stand-up thinking , Nixie . That was really smart . " " But I wanted Mom . " Her voice cracked with tears and mucus flowing . " I wanted Dad , and I went up the back way , Inga 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were going into my room , and Coyle 's room , and I knew what they would do , but I wanted my mom , and I crawled in , and I got their blood on me , and I saw them . They were dead . They 're all dead , are n't they ? Everybody . I could n't go look . I went to hide . " " You did right . You did exactly right . Look at me . Nixie . " She waited until those drenched eyes met hers . " You 're alive , and you did everything right . Because you did , it 's going to help me find the people who did this , and make them pay . " " My mommy 's dead . " Continues ...
