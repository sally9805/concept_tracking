<p> No one has ever come up with a satisfactory count of the books dealing with the Civil War . Estimates range from 50,000 to more than 70,000 , with new titles added every day . All that can be said for certain is that the Civil War is easily the most written-about era of the nation 's history . Consequently , to describe this 10-best list as subjective is to stretch that word almost out of shape . Indeed my association with 2 of the 10 may be regarded as suspect . My reply is that this association made me only more aware of the merits of these titles . <p> Silently transmuting " books " into " works " allowed me to include a pair of dual selections . In the case of Bell Irvin Wiley 's classics there is justification for this , for The Life of Johnny Reb and The Life of Billy Yank have appeared since their original publication in a single volume under the tide The Common Soldier in the Civil War . That edition , alas , is no longer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for Bruce Catton 's two-volume Grant biography , it is simply too important a work to be excluded . <p> No campaign or battle histories are on the list , for good reason : There are simply too many first-rate ones to choose from . The outburst of Civil War writing over the past two or three decades has left no important battle unrecorded , all of them covered at least competently and many superbly . There are also too many well-done unit histories to permit selecting a best one , and of a seemingly endless list of biographies , only those of the two most important figures can be represented here . <p> For those willing to absorb their Civil War history in longer takes , there are of course three classics : Allan Nevins 's all-inclusive four-volume study of the war years , The War for the Union ; Shelby Foote 's justly acclaimed three-volume The Civil War : A Narrative ; and what in my view is the capstone of Bruce Catton 's distinguished career , The Centennial History of the Civil War , in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is Ken Burns 's incomparable 11 - hour film The Civil War . But as a compass for navigating this vast sea of literature , these 10 selections ought to suffice . <p> Battle Cry of Freedom : The Civil War Era , by James M. McPherson ( 1988 ; Oxford ) . This one-volume study of the Civil War apparently met an unfulfilled need : It was 16 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list , and sales during its first decade exceeded 500,000 copies . He and his publisher , said McPherson , " were equally astonished by the book 's commercial success . " In fact , no previous author had come close to matching McPherson at melding all the military , political , economic , and social aspects of the era into a single narrative . Nor has any author matched him since . Battle Cry of Freedom is a long read ( 900-plus pages ) but engrossing and immensely rewarding . <p> Look Away ! A History of the Confederate States of America , by William C. Davis ( 2002 ; Simon &; Schuster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , " Davis writes in his preface , and then he proceeds to do full justice to the tale . Confederate history balanced on a dilemma : " Throughout there runs a thread of a people whose rulers were trying to bring a link from their past into a new nation in a modern world , to create what they thought they wanted without giving up what they thought they needed . " Davis explains it all crisply and authoritatively , leaving the reader with the distinct impression that this is how it really was in Dixie . <p> Lincoln , by David Herbert Donald ( 1995 ; Simon &; Schuster ) . Harvard 's Donald shaped this monumental biography , he tells us , around " Lincoln 's point of view , using the information and ideas that were available to him . It seeks to explain rather than to judge . " The result emphasizes the sixteenth President 's astonishing capacity for growth , the trait that enabled " one of the least experienced and most poorly prepared men ever elected to high office to become the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Little , Brown ) and Grant Takes Command ( 1969 ; Little , Brown ) , by Bruce Catton . The Union 's greatest soldier , superbly delineated by the Civil War 's greatest historian . This is purely military biography . Grant Moves South carries the story through Vicksburg , and Grant Takes Command concludes it at a grand review in May 1865 . Catton 's eye for " the unpronounceable man " is unerring . <p> Lee 's Lieutenants : A Study in Command , by Douglas Southall Freeman , one-volume abridgment by Stephen W. Sears ( 1998 ; Simon &; Schuster ) . After completing his magisterial four-volume biography of Robert E. Lee , Freeman expressed concern that those lieutenants of Lee 's might have " ridden so far toward oblivion that one could not discern the figures or hope to overtake them before they had passed over the horizon of time . " But Freeman succeeded in capturing all of them , for all time . Published in three volumes in 1942-44 , Lee 's Lieutenants remains a paramount example of group biography , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mary Chestnut 's Civil War , edited by C. Vann Woodward ( 1981 ; Yale ) . A unique insider 's portrait of life in the war-torn Confederacy . The neutral-sounding title reflects editor Woodward 's brilliant - and Pulitzer Prize-winning - recasting of what was once known as A Diary From Dixie . The " diary " is actually a postwar creation much expanded from a wartime journal . But , as Woodward writes , " Mary Chesnut can be said to have shown an unusual sense of responsibility toward the history she records and a reassuring faithfulness to perceptions of her experience of the period . " Her work remains a vivid evocation of the chaos and complexity of a society at war . <p> Reveille in Washington , 1860-1865 , by Margaret Leech ( 1941 ; Avalon ) . The tale , masterfully told , of the citizens of the nation 's capital , both the leaders and the led , groping toward some understanding of the unimaginable reality of a great civil war at their very doorsteps . A tour de force - and another Pulitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Common Soldier of the Confederacy ( 1943 ; Louisiana State ) and The Life of Billy Yank : The Common Soldier of the Union ( 1952 ; Louisiana State ) , by Bell Irvin Wiley . In the preface to Johnny Reb , Bell Wiley observed that his work was " an attempt to give the man of the ranks , who after all was the army , something of his rightful measure of consideration . " Wiley 's was a truly pioneering effort , constructed almost entirely from soldiers ' letters and diaries and memoirs to portray daily life in camp , on the march , and in battle . No one has ever done it better , and Johnny Reb and Billy Yank still make wonderful reading . <p> Mr. Dunn Browne 's Experiences in the Army : The Civil War Letters of Samuel W. Fiske , edited by Stephen W. Sears ( 1998 ; Fordham ) . Among the myriad published letters and diaries of Civil War soldiers this collection is unique . Captain Fiske , 14th Connecticut Volunteers , Army of the Potomac , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Writing weekly to the Springfield , Massachusetts , Republican under the nom de plume Dunn Browne , Fiske pulled no punches in these observant , witty , sometimes angry , frequently profound letters from the battle lines to the folks back home . <p> John Brown 's Body , by Stephen Vincent Bent ( 1928 ; Ivan R. Dee ) . The critic Henry Seidel Canby , in an introduction to Bent 's epic narrative poem , termed it a veritable library of storytelling , " a poem extraordinarily rich in action as well as actors , vivid , varied , and so expressive of many men and moods that prose could never have carried its electric burden . " Good art it is , and good history too , making John Brown 's Body a stunning recreation of the Civil War era . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dawn Before Gettysburg , by Edward Hopper , 1934 . <p> By Stephen W.
