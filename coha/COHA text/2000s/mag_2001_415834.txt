Abraham David Christian travels the world , translating his experiences into austere white paperboard sculptures and abstract graphite drawings . A show in Germany offered a 20 year survey of his deceptively simple , meditative works . // Above , Abraham David Christian : Untitled , 1992 , painted paper , 9 1/2 by 10 3/4 by 6 1/3 inches .

He is so often on the road that a Tokyo group-show catalogue that listed home bases for other artists , for Christian said , " Travels . " It 's ironic , especially considering that he is a U.S. citizen and the sculptures he shows around the world are created solely in his tenement apartment/studio near SoHo , that Christian is not well known in America . Gallery solos with Diane Brown and Scott Hanson in the ' ' 80s , a four-person show at the Queens Museum in 1991 and a completely overlooked show at Annina Nosei Gallery in the spring of 1999 are the extent of his New York exposure . A survey covering 20-plus years of his sculptures and drawings , presented in spring 2000 at the Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum in Duisburg , Germany , reflected his nomadism : the drawings , though they usually appear to be abstract , are made on-site as a way of processing his travel experiences . They are often named after the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not obvious ) correspondence , his remarkably cohesive body of sculptures avoids reference to place , escapes style and blurs the specifics of time and artistic " development . " Aside from an occasional bronze , the three-dimensional works are made of paperboard . Christian limits himself to modest-size pieces that can be carried down flights of stairs and can pass through the narrow doors of his studio/residence . He devises a structure and fashions a surface of two-ply museum board , sometimes supplemented with plaster or wood . He paints the sculpture dark gray so that he can evaluate the form and , if satisfied , paints it white using powdered pigment . He paints without interruption and with obsessive care to assure that no edges mar the continuity of the paint surface , although he often gives prominence to seams in the structure .

The white is a milky skin , thin and rubbed-looking ; the gray underpainting may emerge subtly , like the blue of veins . Christian 's use of white evokes both symbolic aspirations and quotidian facts : pure spirituality on the one hand and the impurity that the accidents of time administer on the other . Many of the forms are so radially symmetrical that one might think they were turned on a lathe . But that 's not the case , and , in fact , that first impression yields to the recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of touch . Circles , whether suggesting bowls , stools , targets , coils or stupas , reflect the artist 's interest in the symbolism of Eastern religions and his extensive travels in Asia , where the Buddhist wheel and mandalas make the circle heavy with import.I Critic and curator Richard Milazzo has noted the qualities of repetition and rotation in Christian 's sculptures , commenting that they " seem to contain within themselves temporality as a cyclic rather than chronological experience . " 2 There is not even a whiff of irony in the works , only an oddly gentle intensity conveyed through a measured distillation of line , form and surface . The Lehmbruck Museum exhibition occupied one very large gallery and a substantial anteroom ( a few sculptures by Christian could also be found in the museum 's permanent-collection display ) . Surprisingly , this was the first museum presentation of Christian 's sculptures in Germany , although his drawings have been widely shown . The first work one came upon was actually the least typical piece in the show . It was a 1978 sculpture from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectangular block of dried mud-not rock-that looks massive but soft . It is isolated on a surface of the same color that 's recessed slightly into a white plinth that sets it off , like matting . One of the short ends of this block is notched , and a corner is broken off . The thing is pocked with holes and flecked with bits of white . It 's an extraction that speaks of that larger whole , the earth , from which it was removed . The title refers to the ancient site of Hebrew mass suicide , to which the artist walked alone during a stay in Israel . The weary , wounded slab seems to embody the passage of time and allude to all the history that the earth has impassively seen , as well as to the metaphorical " dust to dust . " The inclusion of this anomalous example acknowledged the artist 's earliest materials and his former practice of giving titles to his sculptures , both of which were true when the barely 20-year-old Christian was included in Documents 5 in 1972 and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dusseldorf , in 1973 . His trajectory since then has been one of reduction , simplification and clarification , but this somber and sensitive piece of earth accurately sets the tone of the exhibition . Untitled works in a panoply of curves-circular , oval and boat  --  shaped-dominated the main gallery . Christian 's sculptures have a curiously hard-to-quantify character ; he tends not to make isolated masterworks , but although he produces in quantity and makes visually related works , it 's difficult to regard them as series because they are not clustered in a discrete span of time . A further complication is the absence of any sense of progression . He introduces new forms from time to time but also revisits old ones , obscuring chronology . Each work seems as complete , compelling and individual as an interesting person . However , for discussion purposes the sculptures can be roughly grouped into four categories : works that hint at temples and shrines , a few suggesting natural or architectural sources of inspiration , those that recall folk or tribal furniture , and some others without obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Above , Untitled , 1995-96 , painted paper , 27 1/2 by 15 1/3 by 6 1/4 inches .

Private collection . // A piece evoking religious architecture is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan3 ( 1988-97 ) , a totemic stack of white disks and cones . It looks lightweight and fragile but also suggests monumentality through the simplicity of its parts . The shadows it throws vary according to the permutations of knife edges and ascending or descending curves . A multipart work called Nine Sculptures ( 1989-97 ) was set in a narrow , unenterable space between two freestanding walls . This row of apparently identical objects on a shelf could be examined only from the perspective of the two ends of the slot . Each sculpture arises from a large disk . The constituent elements might be thought of as five sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tower according to diminishing size . All are white , matte and powdery . The duplication within and among the parts of this work evokes the Buddhist practice of accumulating merit through the repetition of devotions , which has produced such works of art as the array of 1,000 identical Buddha sculptures in Kyoto 's Sanjusangendo ; the limited access may bring to mind the mysteriousness of glimpsed side altars or gated chapels in Roman Catholic churches , as well . The rotary form of the elements seems to demand that viewers circle them , and a certain tension resulted in this installation from the impossibility of following that inclination . Grouped together on rectangular plinths were various sculptures that resemble a skeletal drum , or a stool consisting of a top and bottom disk carved with rough , warped concentric rings and joined by multiple legs . Christian repeats the form in many sizes , as if to deny any one ideal realization of these tenderly imperfect forms , which conflate the stillness of classical architecture ( seen in the whiteness and the colonnade of legs ) with implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with boatlike elliptical tops and bottoms united by a forest of columns that stand at angles ( each with a bamboolike joint ) . Christian also showed tapering stacks of cones that are oriented in the same direction , like a totem pole of toy tops or gyroscopes. // Untitled , 1992-95 , painted paper , each disk 20 1/2 inches in diameter , 7 inches thick . Private collection . All photos this article Terushi Jimbo. // Probably the most delicate and evasive sculptural realization among the works involving circular elements is a coil made of short sections of paperboard ; its many seams recall the nodes in bamboo . As is typical of Christian 's sculptures no matter what the form , these coils look a little like a lot of different things . Think of a coiled hose tipped up on edge , except not as heavy-looking as rubber and not spatially compressed-or think of the erratic spiral vapor trail of a haywire rocket . The form seems temporary and vulnerable . A 1995-96 tabletop piece looks like the facade of a four-story building with three windows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work was shown on a ledge , so that the back could be viewed only obliquely . Yet one could see that both faces of the work have , at top and bottom center , protruding blocks slightly longer than the windows , and stretched between them is a form that recalls a canoe . The work seems to refer simultaneously to shelter and passage , yet the boat shape could also be read as an abstraction that blends male and female genitalia-long and protruding like the penis , oval like a stylized female cleft . A 1995-96 wall relief consists of two targetlike gray circles of contoured concentric rings , one circle notched to nestle snugly against the other . The painted surface is splotchy , as if damp or abraded , and the piece as a whole is very subdued . By contrast , hidden at a back corner of the main gallery , so that its sudden discovery packed a wallop in a show that was overwhelmingly white , was a head-height row of five smooth 20-inch disks in saturated colors , a 1992-95 work . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plate , are colored green , flat orange , cool white , red and a mottled teal blue . The differences in hue cause the viewer to look from one to the next , and the repetition of shape and of color intensity sets up an almost hypnotic rhythm . The opticality seems powerfully formalist in its straightforward effect . But Christian has explained that the colors relate to different levels of Buddhist meditation . White is the highest . Thus one sees that nothing in his oeuvre can be taken solely at face value . The drawings ( graphite , sometimes with paint ) have similar effects of interrelatedness and yet distinctive individuality . In all Christian 's drawings , the thick , ragged black lines , even when brief or incomplete , convey force and surety . In an odd way , they feel more substantial than the sculptures , which seem on the verge of vanishing in a mist of no-color or spinning past the point of visibility . In the spare " Kali Ghat " series ( 1998 ) , the paper is a warm gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped covering of glass but no frame . The graphic fragments are fuses for the imagination : they might recall stems , loops of dropped string , the orbit of planets . The lines are direct , not reworked , not refined . They are isolated on the approximate centers of the page . Photograph Untitled , 1992-95 , painted paper , each disk 20 1/2 inches in diameter , 7 inches thick . Private collection . All photos this article Terushi Jimbo. // The openness of the drawings encourages viewers ' thoughts to wander in a kind of conceptual parallel to the artist 's peregrinations . But any assumption that these fragments might be depictive fades as one looks at more drawings . Two groups of works are named for Hayama , the coastal town south of Tokyo known as the emperor 's summer home . The 1987 selection makes use of large horizontal sheets of offwhite paper , matted and framed in the same subtle color . The compositions are complicated , and their multiple parts often fill the page . The works from 1989 include paired images with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative motif , which is like a stylized pine tree , rigorously generalized and abstracted . Some parts are cut out , and a few cutouts are pasted to the surfaces . All the drawings , whether elaborate or reductive , demonstrate elision and simplification as ways of grasping and managing the visual stimuli of the world . A German curator has described them as neither objective nor subjective and as interweaving Self and Other.4 Christian 's sculptures may more obviously relate to touch and bodily space , but both the rapidly coursing line in some drawings and the hesitations in others communicate in the language of gesture . The two-dimensional works in this show blended with the threedimensional to make a coherent whole . To walk into the main gallery was to encounter a meditative environment that seemed austere and monkish . The installation served the works best by restricting illumination to filtered natural light from skylights . Occasional pin spots pointedly made pools of pale yellow light on the sandy-gray concrete floor between works , rather than shining on the works themselves . The illumination was as atmospheric and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show was the too-orderly arrangement of works on pedestals ; the neat rows did not capitalize on the aura or drama of the sculptures but simply catalogued them . Christian 's works are secretive yet allusive , related yet solitary and , above all , tactile and handmade . These qualities declare his values . Note that the exhibition title , a phrase Christian has long employed , is " The Ways of the World . " That plural is significant . He is not seeking for one . " Abraham David Christian : The Ways of the World " was on view at the Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum , Duisburg /Feb. 20-Apr. 30 , 2000 . It was accompanied by a 176  --  page catalogue with contributions from Christoph Brockhaus , Dorothee Bauerle-Willert , Richard Milazzo and Ulrich Wiesner . Milazzo 's essay is in English and German , the remainder of the catalogue in German only .

All it takes is some " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathered Friend . <p> Simply defined as creating bird-friendly habitats with the use of plants ( preferably native ) and other means , birdscaping is a technique that combines two of America 's fastest growing pastimes -- birding and gardening . <p> The bright orange fruits of the mountain ash add beauty to your yard and provide food for resident birds in late fall and early winter . <p> " Gardening and attracting birds go hand in hand , as both involve working with your yard 's natural environment , " explains Heather Lamb , editor of Birds &; Blooms magazine . " Birdscaping just means that you plan your garden with the intent of attracting birds . The outcome is a pretty garden alive with pretty songbirds . " <p> To successfully create a backyard that 's for the birds , you must know the basics required for their survival . Food , water , and shelter are the crux of any bird-friendly ecosystem . There 's a good chance you already have one or more of these elements in your landscape , so take inventory before getting started . Note any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed-producing perennials and annuals , birdhouses , or birdbaths . Build on existing plants and make a wish list of items you want to grow . Before putting anything in the ground , however , consider its mature size and care requirements . <p> Also , become familiar with the bird species that reside or migrate through your area . After all , you wo n't find a western tanager in Connecticut , no matter how many orange halves you put out for it . <p> Purple coneflower seeds are a favorite food of finches and other birds . Easy to grow and attractive ( although they can spread rapidly like weeds ) , coneflowers also have nectar that attracts hummingbirds as well as butterflies . <p> L : Set the table . Birds , like humans , appreciate a good meal . " Feeding birds creates a connection with something beyond my control , " Lamb says . " I can provide the right seed , but I ca n't make a goldfinch stop by to eat it . It 's a privilege , an unexpected gift that puts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are diverse . Some prefer fruit , nectar , or sugar water . Others gobble up seeds , nuts , berries , buds , or insects . To optimize your chances of winged diners , offer a mix of native annuals , perennials , grasses , trees , and shrubs that provide sustenance . <p> Know when your plants produce fruit or go to seed . By incorporating picks that feed birds throughout the year -- cherry in summer , sunflower in fall , hawthorn in winter -- you ensure a four-season flurry of activity . <p> Set out bird feeders , which supplement nature 's bounty during lean times such as early spring ( when migration is in full swing ) . Popular offerings include sugar water for hummingbirds and tanagers ; live mealworms for bluebirds and American robins ; orange halves for orioles ; sunflower seeds for grosbeaks , jays , northern cardinals , and chickadees ; and nyjer ( thistle ) seed for finches , pine siskins , and redpolls . <p> L : Give them shelter . Cover is as important to birds as food . Backyard bird expert and author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-made and natural shelter . Man-made in the form of birdhouses , roosting boxes , and brush piles . But , more importantly , natural habitat -- trees , shrubs , and ground cover into which birds can escape when threatened . " <p> Trees and shrubs provide protected nesting sites , a place to perch , and a safe haven from predators . Groupings of evergreens , thorny thickets , and ornamental grasses are adequate places for birds to hide from threats such as hawks and cats . Dense conifers also offer four-season refuge , and thick stands of shrubbery shield birds from cold , wind , rain , and snow . <p> " The best format for natural shelter is in the form of stadium seating , " Harrison explains . " Locate the tallest trees farthest from your favorite bird viewing window , the shrubs closer , and ground cover closest . This staging allows the bird watcher to view all the birds that use each of the natural niches , from the warblers and flycatchers in the tallest habitat , to the cardinals , blue jays , and chickadees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and juncos on the ground . " <p> Birds are careful when selecting a safe place to raise their young during breeding season . Conifers and deciduous shrubs and trees , even dead ones with knotholes or other cavities , are welcome spots . Plant a flowering dogwood tree and , chances are , an American robin will reward you with a clutch of skyblue eggs in late spring . <p> Not all backyard birds use birdhouses , but many do . Bluebirds , Carolina wrens , tree swallows , nuthatches , purple martins , and chickadees are just a few of the species you may be able to beckon with a birdhouse . Before setting one up , though , learn about the nesting habits of the kind of birds you hope to attract . <p> L : Splish , splash ! Put out a bath . Want birds ? Add water . Winged visitors of all kinds need it year-round for bathing and drinking . Suitable sources include backyard water features , small ponds , and even large-leafed plants that pool rainwater or dew . <p> Birdbaths are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fancy , " says Lamb . " A shallow dish or cake pan will do . In my yard , I use a saucer from an old terra cotta flowerpot . " <p> Regardless of the kind of birdbath you invest in , it 's important to clean it every few days with a stiff bristle brush . Then fill the bath with clean water no deeper than 2 inches . Position your birdbath near natural cover to give birds a place to flee should predators arrive on the scene . <p> A few more secrets -- birds ca n't resist flowing water , so add a fountain or include a small waterfall if installing a larger water feature out back . For those living in northern climates , a heated birdbath will be a popular spot for birds when winter arrives . <p> " Having a birdscaped yard gives us the opportunity to relate to the beautiful feathered animals that surround us , " Harrison says . " It 's emotionally rewarding to interact with nature at this intimate level in your own backyard .

They prefer their baths to be shallow ( to 2 inches deep ) and rough on the bottom so they do n't slip and slide . Baths that are 12 to 18 wide inches will accommodate one bird at a time . For communal bathing , 19 to 36 inches is preferable . <p> By Rachael Liska <p> <p> BRING ON THE BIRDS !
