When you become Pope , you become a prisoner of the Vatican , " worries rising young priest Karol Wojtyla in Have No Fear : The Life of Pope John Paul II ( ABC , Dec. 1 , 8 p.m . E.T. ) . He would prove himself wrong , taking more than 100 overseas trips and becoming a hugely influential and popular figure  --  enough so that his death is marked , less than a year later , by two network specials ( though not enough so that either was scheduled during sweeps ) . <P> ABC 's movie and CBS 's Pope John Paul II ( Dec. 4 , 9 p.m . E.T. , and Dec. 7 , 8 p.m . E.T. ) cover the same birth-to-death span : his youth in Poland , his resistance first against the Nazis and then the communists , his rise to world leader . But they bring out different sides of his personality . Have No Fear 's Wojtyla ( Thomas Kretschmann ) is starchy and principled , more a paragon than a person . CBS 's mini-series presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two : the young priest ( Cary Elwes ) is a jocular guy who talks sex ( within marriage , do n't worry ) with his young parishioners ; the Pontiff ( Jon Voight ) is a self-deprecating wit whose career is unified by a belief in the dignity of life . <P> But John Paul II was more than a kindly pastor . While Pope John Paul II shows his steel in butting heads with communists , it , like the ABC movie , glosses over the controversies and conservatism of his papacy . Women 's role in the church gets maybe a minute 's attention ; contraception comes up only by allusion . In the end , both movies stick to what viewers can agree on ( commies and Nazis , bad ; love , good ) , while skipping much of the Pope 's sometimes polarizing tenure as a leader  --  an unsurprising choice in treating a man literally on track for sainthood . As a result , he becomes less human and less interesting once elected Pope . John Paul II , it turned out , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are .
