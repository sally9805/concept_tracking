There is something mythic about musical prodigy . Child musicians like Mozart , who wrote his first symphony at the age of eight , or Chopin , who wrote polonaises at seven , accomplish something outside the ken of cold and technical fields like mathematics or chess , the other domains of precocious genius . What was it about violinist Niccolo Paganini , for instance , that allowed him to give lauded public performances , occasionally of his own work , at eight years old ? Instrumental prowess aside , it is difficult to imagine how anyone so young could access the emotional depths from which great art draws its power . <p> In the first chapter of Yael Goldstein 's virtuosic debut novel , Overture , a young reporter asks the central character , Natasha Darsky , what has made her " the most famous violinist since Paganini . " Her response , both enigmatic and revealing , is " My love affairs . " Much of what follows traces the effects of Darksy 's two tumultuous first loves - musical composition , and Jean Paul Boumedienne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only blossom in the aftermath of both : as Darsky undergoes ever more magnificent transformations on stage , she grapples with the question that plagues her throughout the novel : if she did not write the music , whose passion does she channel ? What claim can a performer make on the notes scribbled in the fury of someone else 's inspiration ? <p> As a young girl , Darksy is driven by a need to express herself . The daughter of an art dealer , she first turns to drawing and painting ; soon she finds a greater talent for music and devotes herself to the violin . And yet , even though her ability continues to mature , the violin , too , proves an unsatisfactory creative outlet . Darsky decides at 13 that playing music is not enough : she explains that " something still urgently pounded away inside me . The same something that could n't be expelled through paintbrushes or pencils had n't been expelled through my violin . " Though she continues to study the violin , composition becomes her passion . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly selective composing workshop administered by musical luminary Robert Masterson , with whom she has a brief affair ; the following fall , Masterson introduces her to his newest graduate student : Jean Paul . <p> Her attraction to Jean Paul , as a person and a musician , is immediate . Soon she moves into his apartment , and their romance becomes a feverish collaboration : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> As Darsky becomes embroiled in Jean Paul 's theories , her commitment to composition threatens to overshadow her talent as a violinist . Until , that is , she discovers a letter Jean Paul has written to his mother , which implies an asymmetry in their relationship that Darsky finds unbearable : " Sad for me ? Why would he be sad for me ? It could n't be , could it , that it was because he thought my talent was only for understanding ? " <p> This dialectic of understanding the work of others and of expressing one 's own ideas , the very concern that drew Darsky to composing as a child , now rises to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul 's letter , Darsky emerges with the conviction that her own compositions are meaningless , and that her love for Jean Paul is now impossible . She responds by returning to the violin , but with a change : " I began to confront Jean Paul with my violin .. Every composer was Jean Paul , and every piece was a fight . These notes are mine as well , I 'd insist from inside the score ; I own them , too , and I am creating . " Shortly thereafter , as she gives the performance that first brings her international fame at a competition in Vienna , the same overpowering emotions arise in her playing . " Onstage , though , I found there was no audience . There was no stage or score , either ; there was only Jean Paul rising from my violin . " The technical skill dates from her years before college , but her powers of creative interpretation emerge from conflict . Indeed , the music is driven by a need to move beyond the limits of interpretation . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose score she plays - who dictates the emotional content of her notes . <p> The novel 's present action occurs many years later : Darsky is an international success , drawn into her past when her daughter , Alex , disappears . A prodigy as well , premiering as a concert pianist at seven years old , Alex strains to crawl out of her mother 's shadow . Even before Alex has expressed her talents as a musician , she begins to refer to her mother as " the Big One , " in reference to her enormous onstage persona . Later , as a teenager , Alex shows a significant talent for composing that her mother never had ; when Natasha fails to understand her daughter 's musical ideas , Alex begins to tear herself away from her mother 's influence . Just as the elder Darsky wrestles with the control of a composer 's intent in performing , Alex rages against her mother 's increasingly stifling , albeit unintentional , creative control as she strives to find herself as an artist . <p> The resulting metaphor resounds powerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works she plays by channeling her tortured love for the lost Jean Paul ; likewise , Alex finds the emotional reserves to produce original music in the struggle to express herself against a background dominated by the Big One . <p> The daughter of eminent novelist Rebecca Goldstein , Yael Goldstein navigates this difficult landscape - between interpretation and intent ; dominance and individuality - with aplomb . And yet , it would be a mistake to emphasize the younger Goldstein 's connection to the elder . Just as Alex ultimately finds the power to establish herself independently of her mother , Overture demands to be read on its own terms , as the powerful first effort of a young talent who , like a musical prodigy , can access remarkable depths of emotional complexity and insight . It would be misleading to say that Overture shows promise : indeed , Goldstein has already delivered .
