Richmond , British Columbia , has the best Chinese food this side of Shanghai Headnote PLACES IN THE WEST Photograph At Garden City Hot Pot , diners warm themselves with beef , shrimp , and vegetables dipped into steaming hot broth . Photograph At Garden City Hot Pot , diners warm themselves with beef , shrimp , and vegetables dipped into steaming hot broth . // At our table at Kirin Restaurant in Richmond , British Columbia , the conversation focuses on food , a recurring theme any time Chinese people dine together . " Honestly , Chinese food is better here , " says Daisy Wong . " More flavor and freshness . " As we dip thin slices of raw geoduck into seasoned soy , the clean , fresh sweetness of the clam seems to affirm these thoughts . From our table , we can look across the street to see another new restaurant about to open . Miranda Ng says , " My friend is going there tonight . " Writer and food consultant Stephen Wong-no relation to Daisy-responds , " And by this weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " " I 'm a food spy , " says Clara Lau , who makes the 20-minute drive from Vancouver three or four times a week to eat in Richmond . " All Chinese are , " says Stephen . Daisy agrees : " It 's a Chinese thing . " When it comes to superb food , there 's a lot to spy on in Richmond , a Vancouver suburb of 176,000 residents . Located on a series of islands that stretch between two arms of the Fraser River , Richmond has , by general consensus , some of the best Chinese food in North America . And its reputation is growing beyond our continent . " Hong Kong is still the best place for Cantonese food , " says Ng , a frequent traveler to Asia . " But we 're catching up .

Opposite : the fishing port of Steveston . // When you first see Richmond , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginable . Drive down one of its main streets , and you see a gray landscape of shopping centers , blocky apartment houses , and hulking megamalls . You do n't feel you 're embarking on a food lover 's adventure . You feel like you 're shopping for tires . Richmond was for decades a farm town , home to dairy cows and blueberries . It then grew into a standard-issue Canadian suburb , probably best known for its proximity to Vancouver 's airport . When local businessman and community leader Bennie Yung arrived in 1975 , he remembers , Richmond did n't possess any authentic Chinese restaurants . But , Yung recalls , in the mid- to late ' 80s , many Chinese emigrated from Hong Kong and Taiwan to British Columbia . And they discovered Richmond . The city 's name , Yung explains , sounded like " rich land " - which signaled prosperity . Richmond 's location , on the jutting lower jaw of the mouth that is greater Vancouver , was said to possess good feng shui . The city continued to grow in the 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People 's Republic of China . The joke became , " What 's the quickest way from Vancouver to Hong Kong ? Take the Arthur Laing Bridge " ( which connects Vancouver with Richmond ) . Today about 40 percent of Richmond 's residents are Chinese ; another 20 percent are from elsewhere in Asia . And there are an estimated 400 Chinese restaurants in town . These restaurants are concentrated in the Asian retail area , dubbed Asia West or Golden Village . Others spill over into the downtown area near Westminster Highway and No. 3 Road , the main north-south artery . Oriental Delight , Garden City Hot Pot-the names of the restaurants are displayed in both English and Chinese . Every once in a while , you get a glimpse of the Vancouver skyline and the mountains behind it . It 's then that you remember Richmond is an island city , and you feel it being set loose from North America to float west to Asia . Richmond is being transformed into something partly Canadian , partly Chinese-a new world all its own . At 8:15 a.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercisers are doing tai chi . It 's fitting that these Richmond residents are exercising at a mall , because in many ways the mall is the center of Richmond life . There are other attractions : the historic port of Steveston , where fresh fish is still sold off boats ; two imposing Buddhist temples ; a pleasant network of trails along the Fraser River . But the malls-Lansdowne , Richmond Centre , new and glitzy Aberdeen Centre , and many more-are king . If you 're used to finding great food in settings that are either elegantly urbane or gritty and down-home , arriving for dinner at a Richmond mall is a little unsettling . Yet the food can be phenomenal . At Aberdeen Centre 's chic Fisherman 's Terrace Seafood Restaurant , you can choose from more than 60 dim sum items . On a cold winter night , get in line at Garden City hot Pot for a Chinese fondue-style mealcooking your dinner in steaming hot broth . At Sun Sui Wah , you can splurge on a 10-pound steamed Alaskan king crab with garlic . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in a mall but on the ground floor of an apartment building across from Richmond Centre ) , you can try Shanghai steamed buns , hand-pulled noodles , and tea-smoked duck . Despite the setting , Richmond 's restaurants have grown increasingly sophisticated . While David Jue-owner of Bamboo Grove , the city 's oldest existing Chinese restaurant-says that traditionally here " food comes first , then service , then atmosphere , " newer Richmond restaurants wow with ambience . Shanghai River , for example , bridges the gap between dining and entertainment with its subtle contemporary decor and its open kitchen , where you can watch noodles being stretched to incredible lengths . " Chinese people love a new attraction , " says chef-owner Bill Cheung . The cuisine has taken interesting turns as well . At intimate , elegant Zen Fine Chinese Cuisine , chef-owner Sam Lau cooks what he calls modern Chinese food , which he offers in a prix fixe tasting menu . " It 's not fusion , " Lau insists . " Some courses are straight Chinese . I cook the authentic way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an island city ... set loose from North America to float west to Asia // The Richmond Public Market bustles with shoppers seeking seafood , snake soup , or herbal remedies . For a sleeker , more controlled shopping experience , head to T &T; Supermarket , part of the largest Asian grocery chain in Canada . Here , across the street from Aberdeen Centre , customers are serenaded by softly piped-in music while they fill shopping carts with live crabs , clams , and abalone from T &T's; fish tanks ; they can also buy tropical fruits seldom seen in the U.S. ( purple-skinned tart-sweet mangosteens , spiky durians with their unforgettable stink ) and fresh , frozen , and canned foods from all over Asia . " Our customers are used to high standards in Hong Kong and Taiwan , " says T &T's; marketing manager , Melina Hung . " They expect that here . Every Chinese is an expert on food . " So powerful is the Richmond food scene that it can even alter people 's lives . Take Maggie Lee . I arranged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aberdeen Centre . When I arrived , she was n't there yet . A few minutes later , I saw a striking , curvaceous woman with short , spiky hair being shown to her table . I was then shown to the same table . Both of us were surprised . Lee expected to see a white face . After hearing about Lee 's food expertise , I expected a Chinese grandmother .

On the table was a dish of pea tips with fresh bean-curd skins , perfect in its simplicity . Hargow ( shrimp dumplings ) and siumai ( pork dumplings ) then arrived . Both are common dim sum offerings , but here they were anything but ordinary . The plump hargow were rich with chunks of shrimp . ( " Eat them now , when they 're hot , " Lee advised me . ) The siumai had a topping of fresh tobiko ( flying fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewels . We were then offered a small dish of XO sauce . The condiment , made with expensive ingredients such as shredded dried scallops and dried shrimp , is usually reserved for special guests or regular customers-which we were treated as , because Lee had been referred by a friend . As we ate , Lee told me her story . She and her two sons came to Canada nine years ago from Hong Kong . Her youngest son was n't interested in regular school , she said , so he applied to culinary school . " Then we decided we would go together . " I tried to withdraw three times , " Lee told me . But she stuck it out . " Now I 'm really proud of him . And of myself . He was the top student out of 20 . And I was the one after him . " Her son is now apprenticing to become a chef , and Maggie Lee is enjoying a new career as a cook at a casino here in Richmond . The meal continued , wonderfully . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinegar , ginger , and peanuts . I recognized this dish as one my mother cooked for me after the birth of my first daughter . It is supposed to help rebuild the body after childbirth . The taste reminded me of what food at its best can be : comforting and sensual at the same time . That , in its essence , is what much of the food of Richmond is all about . We got our chicken salad-deliciously moist with chicken stock and dark soy . " You soak the chicken , " Lee explained , " then turn off the heat . That makes the chicken very tender . It 's a secret recipe . This restaurant does it well . " I could see Lee thinking about her own repertoire of dishes . " When I know a recipe is good , " she said , " I write it down for my own book . I 'm passionate about food .
