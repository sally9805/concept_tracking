Q : Recently , NASA released a report claiming the robotic arm on its Mars Polar Lander was a success . Last week F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. , chairman of the House Committee on Science , ridiculed the report , pointing out that the whole contraption crashed on the red planet before the robotic arm was ever deployed . Was NASA trying to pull a fast one ? <P> A : Technically , no . Long before the crash , NASA chose specific projects to include in its annual report . As luck would have it , the only part of the lander mission they chose to rate was the robotic arm , and when they tested it on earth , it worked like a charm . If you lost a $165 million lander because of a missing line of computer code , would n't you try to accentuate the positive ?
