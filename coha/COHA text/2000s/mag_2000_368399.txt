I was so naive . Like a swing voter , I got sucked in by negative TV ads . When I moved to San Francisco in April , Pacific Bell was all over the airwaves with a spot that spoofed life in a cable-modem world , where neighbors have to share Internet bandwidth and end up fighting one another during prime time because their service has slowed to a crawl . This , the ad said , is why you should instead get the superfast phone technology DSL ( Digital Subscriber Line ) . For $40 or more a month , it 's supposed to let you surf at around 30 times the speed of a 56K modem and talk on the phone at the same time . <P> But five months and 22 days after I placed my order with Pac Bell , I had yet to experience the joys of DSL . My first six months in California were a haze of unrequited relationships with customer-service reps . Suffering long hours of Muzak attacks , I 'd stay sane by doodling lists of alternative acronyms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do Stop Lagging ! <P> Or I would hang up and log on to
