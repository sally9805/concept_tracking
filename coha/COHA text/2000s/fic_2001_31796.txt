Chapter One The townspeople of the long-settled eastern village never really grew easy with Preacher around . The mountain man walked like a big panther , silent and sure . A few of the town and the area 's bully-boys felt compelled to call him out for a tussle . They very quickly learned that Preacher fought under no rules except his own . One bully-boy lost an eye , another was abed all winter with broken ribs , and the third-and final man to challenge Preacher-was buried one cold February morning . " I reckon , " Preacher said to his pa and ma one day , " I best be thinkin ' of headin ' back to the High Lonesome . " " It 's been so good to see you , son , " his mother said , placing her hand over his . " But I fear for you here . " " You do n't need to be fearful for me , Ma , " Preacher said . " That bully-boy pulled a blade on me . I had no choice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Preacher 's father said , stuffing his old pipe full of tobacco . He knelt by the fire and picked out a lighted twig and puffed . Back in his chair , he said , " You 've left us money a-plenty to last for the rest of our years . I do n't want to see grief come to you . And it will come if you stay around here . " Preacher knew his parents were right . He just did n't want to admit it.But he knew he 'd out-stayed his welcome in town . He just did n't fit in . Preacher was all muscle and bone and gristle . He was tanned dark by the sun and the wind , he carried the scars of a dozen deadly battles , and he operated under no moral or legal code save that of his own . And nobody was going to make him conform to any standard except that which he considered fair . But in his own peculiar way , Preacher was a highly moral man for the time , this year of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost respect for womanhood . He loved the land and the critters on it . He could not abide injustice . He did n't like lawyers and thought the country in general was going to Hell in a handbasket . Preacher nodded his head . " You 're both right . My good brothers wo n't even come around whilst I 'm here . " His mother smiled . " They 're afraid of you , son . They belong to order and families and the clock . You belong to the wilderness . Their lives are routine . Your life is like the wind . They do n't , ca n't , understand that . " Preacher cut his eyes to the west . " For a fact , " he muttered , " I have missed the mountains . " His father 's old eyes twinkled . " I see where you 've packed your gear . You must have been thinking about leaving . " Preacher laughed and gently placed one strong hand on his father 's stooped shoulders , bent from years of brutally hard work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I reckon I 'll pull out come the mornin ' . Ma , if you 'll make me a little poke of food , I 'd be obliged . " He stood up . " Where are you going , son ? " his mother asked . " Oh , I think I 'll take me a little stroll through the town . Give the good folks one last look ' fore they 're shut of me . " He looked at this parents . " You know when I leave this go-round , I prob'ly wo n't be back . " They nodded their heads . Preacher stepped out of the house into the cold early March air of Ohio . A thin covering of new snow the past night had laid a carpet of white over the land . Preacher checked on his horse , Thunder , and then decided to stretch his legs and walk the short distance into the village . A town , actually . Darn near five hundred people lived all crowded up like ants . Preacher still drew stares from the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the combination coach stop , hotel , and tavern and opened the door . The buzz of conversation stopped when he padded silently up to the bar , the soles of his high-topped moccasins making no more than a whisper on the floor . He leaned on the bar and ordered a whiskey with a beer chaser . Several ladies who had stopped there for the night and were waiting on the afternoon coach began whispering behind their fancy fans . Preacher paid them no mind . From the looks of them they were city women , all gussied up to beat the band . Preacher took a sip of whiskey and a sip of beer . He hid a smile as the few locals who were lined up at the bar backed away , clear down to the end , getting as far away from Preacher as they could . It had been in this very tavern , just two weeks past , that Preacher had killed that feller who shucked out his knife during what Preacher had thought was just a friendly fist-fight . Preacher had left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door opened and a frail boy of about nine or ten entered . They boy 's clothing was ragged and the soles of his shoes were tied on with string . He carried a small bucket with a lid on it . The top of the boy 's head just did reach the lip of the bar . He placed the bucket on the bar and said , " A bucket of beer for Mister Parks , please , sir . " The barkeep took the bucket to rinse it out and the boy looked at the free lunch on the table , hunger in his eyes . His pinched face was pale and his eyes held a strange brightness . " You hungry , boy ? " Preacher asked . The boy 's eyes were scared as they fixed on the mountain man . " Yes , sir . Some . " " Then fix you a sandwich or two . " " That food 's for customers ! " the barkeep hollered . " The lad just bought a bucket of beer , did n't he ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fix you something to eat , boy . " " I 'll slap you , boy ! " the barkeep barked . " You stay away from that food , you ... woods ' colt . " Preacher gave the barkeep a disgusted look as he walked to the table and fixed two huge meat and cheese sandwiches and gave them to the boy . " You sit over there by the stove and eat and get warm , boy . " He turned to the barkeep . " You want to slap me ? " The man paled . " Ah , no , sir ! " " Fine . Now you pour that lad a big glass of milk and then go on about your business and leave the boy alone . " The boy fell into a hard fit of coughing that reddened his face . Bad lungs , Preacher thought . A wonder he lived through the winter . Hard footsteps slammed on the boards outside the coach stop and the door was flung open . The hard and big bulk of Elam Parks filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quirt in one hand . He pointed the quirt at the boy . " What the hell do you think you 're doing , Eddie ? " he shouted . " I did n't give you permission to eat . " " No . But I did , " Preacher said . In the time Preacher had been in town , he 'd seen enough of Elam Parks to last him two lifetimes . Parks was an important man about the community . He owned several farms , a couple of businesses , and about fifty percent of the local bank . His brother was in tight with the governor , or senator , or some damn blow-heart politician . Parks thought himself the bull of the woods around these parts . He was a bully and a slave-driver to those who had the misfortune to work for him . He gave Preacher the same type of look he might give a roach . Then he turned to the boy . " Get up and get back to work , you worthless whelp ! " " When he finishes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preacher . He was a big'un , all right . Preacher guessed him at about six feet , one inch , with the weight to go with it . A big man with hard packed muscle . " This is none of your affair , Mountain Man , " Parks said , contempt dripping from each word . " So stay out of it . The boy is bound to me and does what I tell him to do . " " Bound , huh ? I thought that practice stopped a long time ago . I never did hold with it . It 's just a fancy word for slavery . I do n't hold with that either . You eat your meal , Eddie . This big mouth can wait . " Elam started stuttering and sputtering , his face beet red . People just did n't talk to him in such a manner . He pointed the quirt at the Preacher and shouted , " I 'll have you run out of town , you , you ... trash ! " Preacher smiled and finished his whiskey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You figure on doin ' that all by yourself , or you gon na call some boys to help you ? " Preacher cut his eyes to the little boy . Eddie was gobbling down his sandwiches as fast as he could . It was evident to Preacher that the sick little boy had not had sufficient food in a long time . Elam dropped his quirt on the table . " Mountain Man , you have had your way in this town for long enough . You been strutting about like a peacock . You need to learn a hard lesson , and I am just the man to teach you . " " Is that a fact ? " Preacher hesitated for a moment , not wanting to bring any further grief to his parents . " Well , mayhaps you 're right . I brung mountain ways to this town and expected folks hereabouts to accept ' em . I do apologize for that . But I do n't apologize for standing up for the lad yonder . He 's a mighty sick little boy . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed under all that grime . Have you been beatin ' on him , Parks ? " " The boy lacks discipline and motivation . Besides , he 's bound to me and what I do is no concern of yours . But now that you have backed down from this issue , we 'll call it even and forget it . " " Whoa ! " Preacher said . " I ai n't never backed down from no man . So do n't you be puttin ' the cart ahead of the horse . " He looked at Eddie . " You want some pie or cake , boy ? " " Now , that 's all ! " Elam blurted . " I have had quite enough of this foolishness . " He moved swift for a man his size . Elam slammed a heavy hand down on Eddie 's shoulder and jerked him to his raggedy shoes . He flung the boy toward the door . Eddie struck the wall and cried out in pain . Preacher took two steps forward and started his punch from down around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of the jaw and stretched the man out on the floor , blood leaking from his mouth . " Oh , my God ! " a local blurted . " Somebody run get Doctor Ellis . " Preacher knelt down beside Eddie . There was a bump on the boy 's head and a slight cut oozing a tiny bit of blood . " Gimmie a wet cloth , " Preacher said . When nobody moved , he added , " Now , damnit ! " One local ran out the door for the doctor while another handed Preacher a dampened cloth . Preacher gently bathed the frightened boy 's face then picked him up and sat him in a chair . " You just take it easy ' til the doc gets here , boy . " " Mountain Man , " a fancy dressed dude said , " you 'd best haul your ashes out of here . Elam Parks is a big man in this state . You 're prison bound when he wakes up . " Preacher ignored the warning . Obviously , Elam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as his older brother rushed into the tavern . The older man looked at the prostrate Parks and blurted , " My God , Art ! Have you taken leave of your senses ? That 's Elam Parks . " " No kiddin ' ? I 'd a swore it was a brayin ' jackass and nothin ' more . " He pointed to Eddie . " What 's the story on this here boy , Brother ? " " He 's a woods ' colt . Elam bound him out of the orphanage to work for him . Nobody gives a hoot about that brat . " " Wrong , Brother . I give a hoot . " The doctor ran in and started for the still unconscious Parks . Preacher grabbed his arm and halted him . " You check the boy first , Doc . Then you tell me about him . " Dr. Ellis hesitated , took a short look into Preacher 's cold eyes , then shrugged his shoulders . He checked Eddie , put some antiseptic on the small cut and took Preacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy is dying , Mister . Lung fever . It 's a miracle he lived through the winter . The next winter will kill him for sure . " " All right . Now you can go check on stupid over yonder . " He walked over to Eddie , past the out-of-town women who were vigorously fanning themselves , their faces flushed from all the excitement . " You got any belongin 's , boy ? " " A few , sir . " " Go fetch them . You 're shut of this town and its sorry people . You 're comin ' with me . " The boy 's sad eyes brightened . " Really ? " " Really . Go on . Get back here as quick as you can . " Preacher walked over to the bar and finished his beer . He watched through amused eyes as several men tried to get Parks up on his feet . " You best get you a hoist , " he called . " It 'll take it to get that moose up . " Parks finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw was swollen and his eyes were glazed . Dr. Ellis bathed his face and the man 's eyes began to focus . Pure hate was shining through , all of it directed at Preacher . " Was I you , Parks , " Preacher said , " I 'd be real careful what come out of my mouth right about now . As upsot as you are , you just might let your butt overload it . " Preacher 's brother rushed over to help Elam get to an upright position . He brushed at Elam 's coat , all the while apologizing for Preacher 's actions . " That 's right , Brother , " Preacher drawled . " Suck up to him . " Elam shoved the men away from him . " Mountain Man , if you 're in town an hour from now , have a gun in your hand . " " I 'll prob'ly be in town . And if I am , I 'll have a gun to hand , Parks . But you best remember this , Parks : I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me and the undertaker will be givin ' you your last tidyin ' up . " Parks snorted his reply and stalked out of the tavern just as Eddie was returning . He drew back his hand to strike the boy and Preacher said , " I 'll break your arm , Parks . " Elam lowered his hand and stomped off . Preacher looked at the rags Eddie had stuffed into a sack and tossed them into a corner . " We 'll get you some new duds , Eddie . But first we get you a bath and a haircut . Then we 'll dust this town . " " Where are we going , Mister Preacher ? " " Where the air is pure and clean . Where them lungs of yours can heal . West , boy . To the mountains . " Chapter Two The barber was nervous as he cut Eddie 's hair , but he managed to get the boy looking presentable without snipping off anything other than hair . Then it was into a hot tub with a bar of strong soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the general store and bought him new clothes , from underwear out . Preacher checked his awesome four-barrel pistol and holstered it . He carried only the one pistol while in town ; but even that made the local constable nervous . The county sheriff was half a day 's ride away . Preacher was under no illusions . He knew that Parks was no coward . If he said he 'd come looking for Preacher , he 'd come . Preacher returned to the barber shop and found a brand new boy waiting for him . Good lookin ' kid , too . Preacher looked at the wall clock . He had about twenty minutes left ' fore Parks would start on the prowl . He walked the boy down to the livery and bought him a pony . The horse was small , but strong limbed and Preacher guessed it had plenty of staying power . He bought a saddle and saddle bags . " You know where Elm Street is , Eddie ? " " Yes , sir , Mister Preacher . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Elm . Second house on the right . Wait there for me . My ma and pa is there . You tell Ma I said to get that poke of food ready . I 'll be along shortly . " " Mister Elam 's a bad one . He 's kilt men before , Preacher , " Eddie warned . " Not as many as I have . Go on . " Preacher made sure the boy was on his way , proudly riding his new pony , and then he stepped out into the street . The town lay silent under the cold sun . Preacher walked right up the center of the main street . " You there ! " the constable called to Preacher from under the awning of his office . " I order you in the name of the law to cease and desist . " " Go suck an egg , " Preacher told him . " I 'm the law around here ! " the man bellowed . " Congratulations . Now go back into your office and drink coffee . Stay off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like that ! " Preacher ignored him and kept on walking . A block ahead of him , Elam Parks stepped off the boardwalk and into the street , a pistol in each hand . The two men began closing the distance . " This do n't have to be , Elam ! " Preacher called . " You abused the boy and got socked in the jaw for it . Now it 's done and past . It ai n't nothin ' worth dyin ' over . " But for Elam , time for talking was gone . He had been humiliated in his own town and had to redeem himself in the eyes of the citizens . He lifted a pistol and fired . The ball missed Preacher by several feet . " You better make the next one count , Elam , " Preacher called , his own pistol still holstered . Elam fired his second pistol . Again he missed . " Now it 's over , Elam , " Preacher called . " You took your shots and you missed . I ai n't gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me nor the boy never again . " Elam was frantically reloading . " You son of a whore ! " he yelled at Preacher .
