Thank you , beautiful , " I said as my six-year-old daughter , Maude , came skipping over from the swings to hand me a warm , wilted bouquet of dandelions . Dandelions , the only flowers no one cares if you pick . Maude smiled at me , then turned and ran screaming back to the playground . <p> " Stop , " she called as she ran , her voice freezing Kyle , her best friend , in mid-motion about to sit on the one free swing . " It 's my turn . " <p> " You should n't call her that , " Bibi , Kyle 's mom , said . Bibi was my oldest friend ; we 'd known each other since college . <p> " What ? " I was n't really paying attention . I was watching to make sure Maude did n't bully Kyle , who was small for his age , a worrier and easily bossed . Instead Maude turned suddenly gracious and led Kyle by the hand to the playground 's other swing set where two cast aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bibi said , raking her long black hair out of her eyes with her fingernails . " Or is beautiful an adverb ? " <p> " Adverbs modify verbs , " I said , English teacher that I was . " Beautifully is an adverb . As in ' Maude sings beautifully . ' " Maude , as a matter of fact , took after me and could n't carry a tune in a great big bucket . <p> Bibi waved away the instruction . " The point is , Jean , you should n't call Maude beautiful . " Bibi emphasized beautiful in a way that held it out like a dirty sock between two pinched , disapproving fingers . I looked across the playground at Maude . As I watched , Maude 's blond hair flew first forward then back as she swung her horse without mercy toward some imaginary finish line . Her eyes looked blue and big and bright even from here . Why should n't I call my daughter beautiful ? Maude was beautiful . <p> And not because of hair or eye color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two thirds of the kids in Maude 's first-grade class were blond . Kyle was so fair my husband , Anders , joked you could read a newspaper through him . And it was n't her neat , symmetrical little girl chin and nose . She was beautiful because in some way I could n't quite prove scientifically , she glowed . She spun off energy like a hot , new star . <p> Not a day went by people in the street or the grocery store did n't notice , did n't stop me and repeat that very b word . What a beautiful baby , what a beautiful girl . At the Mexican restaurant near our house where we stopped for takeout , the senora called Maude La Linda . " Beauty , " Anders would say , when Maude pitched a fit over some little thing , " and Beast . " <p> " It warps girls , " Bibi said , her voice was shaking . She sounded like she might cry . " Take my word for it . I know . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not . Nice-looking , neat maybe , but not beautiful . " It becomes everything to you . You end up spending all your time trying to be beautiful , wondering why no one has called you beautiful yet today , this hour , this minute . You live in fear of the day you 'll get sick or old and turn so ugly no one will love you . " <p> " Oh , honey , " I said . I put my arm around her and squeezed her shoulder , but at the same time I thought , She 's talking about her life , not Maude 's . <p> Bibi accepted the consolation of the hug , but said , " I know what I 'm talking about , Jean . You should listen . " <p> I frowned , shifting my focus from Bibi to Maude . My beautiful girl . It seemed so innocent . " Do you really think I 'm hurting her ? " <p> " Not if you stop , " Bibi said . <p> I looked toward Maude . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her small sneakered feet raising dust . She was putting her back into it , clearly determined to go faster than childkind had ever gone before . Kyle was hanging on with both hands , squeaking , No no no . And then something that sounded like suspiciously like Sssstttttoooopppp . Instead Maude jumped onto the flying carousel and stood right in the middle , hands flung up to the sky , a blond whirligig , a Wisconsin dervish . Kyle let go of the safety bar and clung to her leg . <p> Bibi was looking not at the pale blur that was her son , but at the horizon , at the tall chain-link fence that marked the boundary between playground and park  --  this side for children , the other for grass . She seemed , for a moment , to have forgotten we were there . She sighed . <p> " I 'd better grab Maude , " I said , giving Bibi 's shoulder a last , clumsy pat , " before she breaks Kyle in two . " <p> All the way home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was she right about Maude ? It was hard to know . I thought of Bibi , so bright and , yes , beautiful , sitting on the bench in her red tunic and purple velvet bell-bottoms . I would never have admitted this to Bibi , but I picked clothes to be purposefully neutral . That way if I wore the same sweater three days in a row , people assumed I owned three gray sweaters . Actually , I owned half a closetful . <p> I thought about what she 'd said while I sorted the dirty clothes before dinner . One basket of whites  --  mostly towels and Anders 's T-shirts . One of darks  --  my grays and Anders 's black jeans . In a college town like ours , nearly everyone wore black , the house color of academics . One basket of bright colors  --  all Maude 's . Did beautiful people instinctively crave purples and oranges and reds ? Maude had a weakness for chartreuse as well . <p> Over dinner , Anders told about his trip to our neighborhood hardware store to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Anders was a photographer who taught in the art department at the state university , but lately his photographs had begun to leap , rather inconveniently , off the walls . He cut and arranged them in dioramas and installed them in large impressive pieces of vaguely Victorian cabinetry . He 'd even made an inlaid teak projector stand that spun in circles while showing magic lantern slides  --  " moving pictures . " I liked it . It was exciting to watch hand-colored prints of tropical fish spin dizzyingly around the room on the white walls above the furniture . It made me think about all the things I took for granted , real movies , TV , video , computers  --  miracles too much a part of everyday life to seem miraculous anymore . <p> These new pieces already took up an amazing amount of space in our small , crowded house , but still Anders kept buying sheets of mahogany , brass pulls and knobs and screws , slowly and quietly building his private World 's Fair . " So , " Anders was telling Maude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up behind me and says , ' Are n't you Maude Dahl 's father ? ' and then the old guy behind the counter says , ' Maude 's your daughter ? ' " Anders laughed . " Is n't that amazing ? I thought . My daughter is famous ! " Maude shrieked she was so delighted . I smiled . <p> The old man behind the counter must have been the owner , Mr. Vandergraff . Maude had gone with her class on a fieldtrip to the hardware store just two weeks before and had come home with instructions for how to make birdfeeders out of pop bottles . Obviously , Maude had made an impression on him . Had she been wearing chartreuse that day ? <p> The woman was probably one of Maude 's many teachers , at school , swimming , Sunday school , tumbling , ballet . Unless she knew Maude from Anders 's pictures . Locally , they were his best-known work . They 'd hung in the faculty show at the university , in the biannual survey of who was who among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where students hung out for hours drinking latte . Over the students ' bent heads hung Maude at four months , an upside-down blur swinging in front of Anders 's lens , the amazing flying baby . Maude at two , with a jumbo pitted olive on the end of each stubby finger like some mutant half-toddler , half-tree frog . <p> Anders shaped his face into an extravagantly artificial frown . " Famous on five continents , but I 'm nobody in this town but Mad Maudie 's dad . " <p> " Oh , Daddy , " Maude rolled her eyes . She had taken to pretending offense when he called her Maudie , his baby name for her . The mad she did n't mind . But was n't " mad " as bad as beautiful ? I wondered , all adjectives suddenly suspect . <p> " When you win the Nobel Prize , " Anders said , his faux frown losing out to his usual slight , mocking smile , " just remember to thank your old dad . " <p> " Thanks , Old Dad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his graying , old dad head . That done , she turned to her mother . " Is there a fieldtrip tomorrow ? " she asked . I nodded . I 'd signed a permission slip for Maude and her fellow kindergartners to be taken to the State Historical Society to see a new exhibit on Native Americans of Wisconsin . I had , as usual , ducked Maude 's teacher 's suggestion that it was my turn to chaperon . I taught freshman English at the local community college and had forty student essays waiting for me in my bulging book bag . " I want to wear my straw hat , Mom , " Maude said . <p> " Are you sure , Maude ? " I said . On family trips , Maude tended to start out with a sunhat and then lose interest . Usually I wound up carrying or wearing it . And none of Maude 's teachers looked like the straw bonnet type . Maude , though , looked absolutely stunning in it . When she 'd worn it to the farmer 's market that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their search for the perfect pumpkin or heirloom apples or aged cheddar could be heard to remark in passing , Did you see that beautiful little girl in that lovely/amazing/damn big straw hat ? I was sure Maude had heard them as well . <p> Maude nodded . " And , " she added , " if they 're clean , I 'll wear my chartreuse socks . " <p> That night after Maude had been steered clear of the treacherous reefs that surrounded six-year-old bedtime and was safely asleep , I lay in bed , trying to summon up some energy for my stack of papers . When I was engaged in my teaching , full of the kind of energy I had rarely been able to summon this fall , I gave my students what I thought of as slightly mad , challenging assignments . Compare someone you love to a wonder of the world . This time I had only told them to compare or contrast two people , places , or things . So I knew without looking I was doomed to comparisons of dogs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hacky Sack , Wisconsin to Iowa or , at best , Illinois . <p> I gave up on my students ' attempt to find meaning in the subtle variations of daily life , and began leafing through one of the many back issues of The New Yorker I had n't gotten around to reading . I glanced at the listings for photography shows . Anders was too busy building his vision of the Past/Future for gallery openings in Manhattan to interest him . I had grown up as an Army brat , moving every four years . Anders had been born in Wisconsin in the same small town where his great-grandparents were buried . He 'd left Wisconsin reluctantly to go to grad school in New York , serving time as if in the foreign legion until he could at last return home , return to a place where the people had the innate sense to call all cold fizzy drinks pop . His plan , he told me on our first date , was to be like Frank Lloyd Wright , a fellow Wisconsin native , who also hated cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his low , well-designed door . <p> When we met , Anders had been a brand-new assistant professor . He was experimenting with color film , mad with the extravagance of having unlimited access to the department 's color processor and printer . He blew up everything he shot to poster-size . He would stay up all night printing what he 'd shot , then drag it still wet into class the next morning for his students to see . <p> After we started dating , Anders begged me to model . If I would , we could spend all our nights together . So I had agreed to pose . But first we 'd gone shopping . Even then my wardrobe had been better suited to black and white photography , so we 'd gone to a vintage clothing store near campus and bought a big red satin shirt the color of Technicolor lipstick . Then we went to an all-night drugstore and bought the lipstick to match . The first night , he took pictures of me leaping off a chair , a blurry , midair kiss of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping-green apples . Then , in an artistic breakthrough , throwing lime Jell-O into the air . <p> Some of the shots looked like Kodak ads  --  all color , no content . But some , when I had tired of the games and the endless delays for moving the spots , metering the lights , reloading the camera , when my mouth was a weary smear , my eyes narrowed , my neck bent with fatigue into a slightly odd , painful angle , voila , there was tension and some hint of a story that would forever remain tantalizing and unknowable . There was art . <p> After the photo sessions , we would make love on the futon that was Anders 's only furniture , and then he would leave me to a few lumpy hours of sleep while he went to his darkroom on campus to develop that night 's film , make color prints from the negatives he 'd taken the night before . <p> By the end of the semester , it was clear that Anders was going to move his futon into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So when Anders asked me to pick up the four-foot party sub he had ordered for his end-of-class party , I agreed . I 'd walked through the door carrying this most ridiculous of foods , and the assembled photography students looked up and cried as one , " It 's her . " As genuinely starstruck as if they had spotted Madonna . " It 's the Jell-O Woman . " For a moment , I was famous . But where was there to go after fruit-flavored gelatin ? I had been relieved when , a little more than a year later , Maude came along to model for Anders . <p> But how long had it been since Anders had taken a picture of Maude ? I tried to remember . Not a roll of holiday snapshots to send my parents , who 'd retired to a condo in Sarasota , but an honest-to-God photo as Art ? I could n't remember . Last summer ? Earlier this fall ? At any rate , before Anders bought a table saw and began building his mahogany boxes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his side , picking up a magazine on the way . Anders actually read the long New Yorker profiles of people you never knew existed until you saw the columns of tiny type about them . I propped myself up on one elbow . " Why do n't you take pictures of Maude anymore ? " <p> " What ? " Anders was flipping through his issue , squinting at the cartoons . " Oh . " He blinked , as if he had n't really realized he had stopped . " No reason . Just that last time , it did n't work out . She posed too much . " <p> " What do mean ? " <p> He shrugged . " She did n't know what to do with her hands , with her mouth . She kept smiling like she thought she should smile in a picture . " He turned back to his magazine . " You ca n't be yourself if you 're worried all the time about being beautiful . " <p> That 's it , I thought , as we settled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all words , adjective and adverb , that referred to the illusion we call our bodies , bodies that were bound in the course of things to grow sick or old . No more beautifuls or lovelies . Not even a stray little don't-you-look-nice . <p> Thursday was Bibi 's and my annual night out to celebrate our birthdays , which fell a mere ten days apart . Our tradition was to go to a bar we 'd never been before , get good and drunk , exchange small gifts , sometimes break into fits of inappropriate song or dance . Once we got bounced from a bar for doing an imitation of the Rockettes , high-kicking and singing " New York , New York , " in my case shrill and off-key . Then , our birthdays duly celebrated , we 'd take taxis home , where families and hangovers awaited us . In other words , for one night we acted like we were still in college . Anders and Bibi 's husband , Lloyd , had seen the ritual enough times that they kept the aspirin handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martini bar . We found a table , then we each pulled out our presents and set them in front of us . Mine for Bibi was in a small gold gift box that had obviously been wrapped at the store , Bibi 's present for me in a red handmade paper bag pulled shut with rough twine . <p> Bibi and I had known each other as undergraduates , floormates in a large , rowdy coed dorm . But we had n't started this tradition , had n't become best friends until we were in grad school . Bibi in her first semester of art and me working on my master 's in English , already teaching freshman composition , though I had n't known then I had stumbled into my future . At that first birthday party , Bibi had handed me a scroll tied up with gold ribbon . I unrolled it , expecting to see words  --  maybe a hand-set poem or a Zen koan done in calligraphy . Instead , the paper was blank . I turned it over , looking carefully at both sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dryer lint . I looked up at Bibi , trying not to look too puzzled . " I made it , " Bibi said , " in my papermaking workshop . You whiz snips of old blue jeans in a blender with water and Elmer 's Glue , then spread it out to dry on an old window screen . " <p> It is lint , I thought . " It 's amazing , " I said , knowing it had probably taken Bibi hours to make . <p> " I 'll show you how to frame it . " Bibi smiled lovingly at the first piece of paper she had ever made . She , too , had found her life 's work . <p> I still had Bibi 's first gift and her second , a blank book . I , on the other hand , doubted Bibi still had the first gift I had given her , a literary guide to Wisconsin . Bibi had flipped through it , peering at the foldout map , at the black and white photos of authors and their houses . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly read , and so had good reason to prefer her books blank . It was me , crazy English major , who liked them dense with type . <p> The second year , I made a better choice , I gave Bibi a pair of earrings . Big purple glass grapes , a bunch for each ear . That set the pattern . Every year was a paper anniversary for Bibi . I , on the other hand , worked my way up from glass to silver . Last year , I 'd even sprung for an odd bobbing pair of fourteen-carat gold plumb weights . This year , though , I 'd broken with tradition . Instead of earrings , I had gotten Bibi a pin . A single smooth nugget of amber the size of a baby 's heart bound with a band of silver , a sharp dagger of a pin set in the back . It looked like something a Goth might have used to close his rough woolen cloak . I could n't wait to see Bibi pin it to her bulky lime-green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had at least one drink . Bibi got her martini with vodka and a pickled baby Vidalia onion . I , ever the more conservative , went for gin and an olive . But after the first glass of pure alcohol , I loosened up . Bibi talked me into ordering something off the specials board for my second . When it arrived it was a lovely , sad blue . What liquor turns a martini aquamarine ? After one sip , I felt like crying . Then I was crying , not from sadness , really , but a sudden acute sense of time slipping past me . I could hear it rushing like water . I remembered our first birthday bash  --  our skin had been peach-perfect . I remembered Maude in my arms for the first time , a red-faced blue-eyed little radish . Where were any of us headed ? Suddenly , time made me dizzy . I wanted to stop the relativity train and get everyone I loved off before we all came to some terrible end . <p> " Are you okay ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching and genuine , though she knew from experience I was a maudlin drunk . <p> I nodded , wiped my eyes with my cocktail napkin . <p> " Hey , " Bibi said , picking up her present , " may I ? " <p> I nodded . " Tear away . " <p> Bibi tore into her birthday gift , shredding the wrapping . She had a casual attitude toward machine-made paper . She held the amber up to the light and let out a long , happy ooooooh . <p> " Be careful , " I said , reaching out to touch the brooch 's silver pin . In my martinied state , I misjudged this distance and pricked myself . As if in fairy tale , a single drop of red blood appeared on the white tip of my finger . <p> " Close your eyes , " Bibi said , unknotting the string on her present to me . I did , and heard a soft whoosh like moths fluttering past me . Bibi put something over my head , placed it gently around my neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened my eyes . This year , Bibi had given me jewelry . A necklace of folded paper strung on a silver cord . A lei . Aloha , I thought , my mind ever the dictionary , a word that means both hello and goodbye . I reached slowly up to touch it , almost afraid the paper might startle and fly away . <p> " It 's beautiful , " I said . <p> Bibi gave a wry laugh . " Oh , I almost forgot , " she said , positioning the amber over her left breast , then stabbing the silver pin into her sweater . " Can you watch Kyle for me on Saturday ? " <p> I noticed my finger was still bleeding . It had left a red smear on my cocktail napkin and probably , though I could n't see it , on the paper necklace as well . " Sure , what time ? Maude has swimming lessons at eight-thirty , but we can be home by nine-fifteen if I tell her Kyle 's coming . Otherwise she takes forever in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She was signaling the waitress for our tab . " I 'll drop Kyle off around ten . I have to go in for another biopsy  --  this time on my right breast . Lloyd 's going to drive me . I should be home by two-thirty at the latest . " <p> I started to say something , I was n't sure what , but Bibi put a finger across my lips . <p> " Later , " she said . " No matter what they find , they wo n't do anything . Not then . " <p> Saturday , Maude was up before the alarm went off , digging through her drawer for her bathing suit and goggles . We had taken the summer off from swimming lessons , and now she was eager to start again at the Y. She had forgotten last spring 's tears over her inability to float on her back . I made a pot of coffee , toasted a bagel . Friday morning after my night out , I had been wretched , as sick as I had ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way of keeping you sober , " Anders had said , shaking his head . This morning I still felt a little shaky . This is what age did to you , I thought . Throw a little party , and it took a week for your liver , cranky old housekeeper , to clean up the place . Maude , a healthy six , ate three heaping bowls of Cheerios . <p> Maude swam with great splashing enthusiasm , cheerfully venturing in over her head . It made me nervous to watch her , but her teacher was full of praise . He moved her up from Minnow to Fish . " The spirit 's there , " he said , when the class was over and the kids ran shivering for the showers . " Her body will catch up . " <p> In the locker room , Maude 's class struggled into their clothes as the next class wriggled into their suits . Lockers banged , and girls shrieked . A baby , sibling of some young amphibian , cried at the top of her lungs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull , clearly planning a comeback . I was pretty sure I had some Tylenol in my purse , and I desperately wanted to wash them down with Diet Coke , that perfect shot of caffeine and NutraSweet . Maude , sensing where her mother was headed , begged a quarter off me for the gum machine . I hesitated . Anders disapproved of gum . It stuck to your shoes and was n't even food , but then again , he was n't here . I opened my change purse and dug out a quarter for Maude . That and a few pennies were all the change I had , but I knew from Maude 's past swimming lessons the Coke machine took dollar bills . <p> What was Bibi doing , thinking right then ? I wondered as I dug through my wallet for a bill that was n't too wrinkled . They would n't let you have breakfast , even before a minor surgical procedure . She must be starving . Bibi always ate a good breakfast . Maybe she was brushing her teeth , over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't swallow . She was n't worried , she 'd told me the night before . This was her third biopsy in as many years . Her mother had been the same way , Bibi said . Biopsies every year and never anything but harmless fibroids . And now with mammograms , every shadow made the docs jump . They 'd be negligent not to follow up . <p> I fed a bill into the Coke machine . It sucked it in halfway , then spat it out . Damn . I smoothed it , running the bill back and forth across the sharp corner of the candy machine . I had had only one lump , one biopsy . It happened just before I met Anders . The scariest thing had been the changing room at the university hospital , a locker room full of women coming in for biopsies , women getting the news from ones already finished , still others on their way to a dose of chemo or radiation . No privacy . In the corners , women wept . Bibi said it was n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubicle with a La-Z-Boy recliner to lounge in while the nurse started her pre-op IV . <p> The Coke machine emphatically and finally rejected my dollar bill . I turned my back on the idea of liquid refreshment other than water . Maude was sitting on the couch by the door , looking glum . Was n't the gum machine working , either ? " What 's the matter , sweetie ? " I said . <p> " I swallowed it . " <p> " The gum ? " <p> " The quarter . " <p> I did n't know what to say . I had heard plenty of jokes over the years about kids swallowing things , about parents keeping watch over toilet bowls to get back diamond engagement rings . Surely , surely swallowing change was not that serious . Maude looked okay . We could afford the quarter . Maybe we should just go home and see what Anders thought . <p> " It hurts , Mom , " Maude said , pointing at a place just below her heart . Now , suddenly there were tears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We went to the emergency room . There the triage nurse was openly concerned . " You did n't call 911 ? " she asked me . <p> I shook my head . The nurse frowned , then turned to Maude . " Tell me what happened , dear . How did you swallow the quarter ? " <p> Maude looked embarrassed . At six , she knew she was old enough to know better . " I do n't know , " she said . " I did n't have pockets so I put it in my mouth , then I was just standing there looking at the gumballs and I forgot and swallowed it . " <p> It made sense , I found myself thinking , drawn in by Maude 's slant logic . I had noticed how few clothes made for girls Maude 's age had pockets . Boys ' pants always had pockets . What were little girls supposed to do , carry purses ? <p> " Did you cough or choke ? " the nurse asked . She was writing all this down . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spit the quarter out but it was too late . " <p> " Are you having trouble breathing ? " <p> " No , " Maude said , " but it hurts . " And she looked like she was going to cry again . I put my arm around her . <p> " It 'll be okay , sweetie , " I said . The nurse , I noticed , looked less sure . <p> " The peds doc will probably want an x-ray , " she said . She put us in a cubicle to wait for the pediatrician on call . A cubicle similar , I imagined , to the one where they would put Bibi . Bibi . Had I told Anders that Bibi was going to drop Kyle off ? I had forgotten my watch , but surely it was ten already . There was a phone on the wall beyond where Maude lay on the narrow examination table , paper sheet pulled up around her neck , but it was a blinking maze of buttons . I ran my hand over Maude 's damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A little , " Maude said . <p> " Rest , sweetie , " I said to my daughter . " I need to call Daddy . " I stuck my head out of the curtain . " Excuse me , " I said to a nurse , not our nurse , behind the desk . " How do I get an outside line on this phone ? " <p> The nurse made a sour face , as if all the indigent moms in town came in here to make phone calls . " Press nine , " she said , " then your number . " <p> " He 's here , " Anders said about Kyle . " He 's watching me stain plywood . Where are you ? " I told him . " What does the doctor say ?

Besides , just because you do something stupid does n't mean you are . Your father knows that . Everyone does stupid things sometimes . " I patted Maude 's papercovered knee . " I certainly have . " <p> " Knock , knock , " a woman called , then flung back the curtain . " I 'm Barbara . The doctor sent me to take you to x-ray . " The woman spoke directly to Maude , not looking at me . You let your daughter swallow a quarter , I thought , and they all know what kind of mother you are . The x-ray technician held out her hand , and Maude hopped down off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt ?

" Are you a medical professional ? " she asked . <p> " No , " I said . Just a person with a passing knowledge of body parts , I wanted to say , but did n't . " I 'm an English teacher . " <p> " Oh , " the technician smiled . " In that case , I 'd better watch my grammar . " She started to lead Maude down the hall . I began to follow . The technician waved me back . " We 'll only be a minute , " she said . " And Maude 's a big girl , are n't you ? " <p> Maude nodded emphatically and abandoned me , the mother who had given her the ill-fated quarter , without a backward glance . <p> Actually , they were n't gone long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first read I Got An X-ray Today ! and the second I Was Brave ! " She was super , " the technician said , holding up the black and gray picture of Maude 's insides . She snapped it under the clip on the light box . " I 'll go get the doctor , " she said , and left . <p> " They make you hold your breath , " Maude said , hopping back up on the table . She was taken with her stickers . " Just like in swimming class . " I wanted to sneak over and flip the switch on the light box , illuminate Maude 's irradiated bones , but before I could move the doctor was there . <p> " Dr. Jorgenson , " he said , holding out his hand . I shook it . He looked about the same age as my students and his palm was almost as soft as Maude 's . " So , " he said , " let 's see where the foreign object in question , the "  --  he glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gotten to . " He flipped on the light . And there was the missing quarter , floating like a bright , full moon in the night that was Maude 's chest . <p> The doctor pulled at his smooth , young chin . " How long ago did she swallow this ? " <p> I peeked at the doctor 's watch . It was nearly ten-thirty . " A little over an hour . " <p> " Hmm , it 's sitting right where the esophagus opens into her stomach . A tight squeeze for a quarter , " he said . " Let me go talk to the pediatric gastroenterologist on call . We may have to go get it . " <p> " Operate ? " <p> Maude was excited . " Will I have a scar like Madeline ? " she asked . The doctor looked puzzled . <p> " It 's a children 's book . The heroine has her appendix out . " <p> " Oh , " Dr. Jorgenson said . " No , no scar . We have this long rubber tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grab the quarter . Bring it up , good as new . " <p> " Yech , " Maude said . Thinking , I imagined , about where that quarter had been , but the doctor thought Maude meant the idea of the endoscopy . <p> " You 'll be asleep , " he said . " You wo n't even know when it happens . " Maude nodded . " Be right back , " he said to me . <p> Maude sat swinging her legs . I wondered if now was a good time to check in with Anders  --  I did n't like the " asleep " part  --  but Dr. Jorgenson was back before I had chance . " Dr. Gert says Maude should rest here for a while . Give her own muscles some time to squeeze that quarter through . We 'll take another x-ray in thirty minutes , okay ? " <p> I did n't like the idea of more radiation , either , but it sounded better than anesthesia . " Okay , " I said to Dr. Jorgenson . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> After he was gone , Maude asked , " What did you do that was stupid , Mom ? " <p> I almost said , " You mean besides start this conversation with my six-year-old daughter ? " But it was too late to back out now . I thought of the time I had eaten a large dose of hash in sloppy joe mix . For a week , I 'd thought my roommates were planning to kill me . Then of the time I slept with my Theory of Composition professor even though I knew he thought my teaching was hopeless . But those did n't seem quite the right examples for Maude . " Well , " I said , " last year I backed out of the garage too fast without really looking and knocked the sideview mirror , bam , right off the car . " <p> " Really ? " Maude asked . <p> I nodded , not adding that I had told the insurance company someone had hit me in the grocery store parking lot . Or that I sometimes dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling me a liar and a lousy driver . " What else ? " Maude asked . <p> " I jumped off the garage roof and broke my collarbone . " Maude nodded . She knew that story . " I swung a baseball bat without looking and hit a kid standing behind me in the nose . " Maude lay down again . <p> " It 's really hurting now , Momma , " she said , touching the same spot under her ribs . If only , I thought , I 'd given Maude a dime . Maude turned over on the examining table , clutching her wrinkled paper towel of a sheet . <p> " Shhh , " I said , stroking her hair . If Maude got any worse , I was going to fling back that curtain and go find Dr. Jorgenson . I put my face next to Maude 's on the little paper pillow . " Then there was the time ... " I had gotten as far on my list of **30;1127;TOOLONG as the time I 'd given the family dachshund a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technician , reappeared . <p> This time Dr. Jorgenson brought Maude back himself . He snapped the x-ray into place on the light box , flipped it on . I could n't see through him  --  he was no x-ray  --  but I did n't have to . Dr. Jorgenson took one look , then whooped and made a fist , pulling victory down from the air . " Way to go , Idaho , " he said to Maude . Then he stepped back , and I could see the full moon of the quarter was much lower and off to one side , no longer centered over the orderly ladder that was Maude 's spine . " Into the stomach and on its way home , " Dr. Jorgenson said . <p> Maude poked at her ribs . " It does n't hurt anymore , " she said , as though that surprised her . <p> " You know , kid , " Dr. Jorgenson said , still admiring the x-ray . He tapped Maude 's faint curving ribs . " You 've got a bea-ut-i-ful set of bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned from our lives into four comic syllables . " You must drink a lot of milk . " <p> " Ice cream , " Maude said seriously . " The secret is ice cream . " <p> " Really ? " Dr. Jorgenson said . He stuck his hand into the pocket of his lab coat , drew out a prescription pad and some children 's Motrin samples . He shook his head and tried the other pocket . " Then you 'd be a good candidate for one of these . " With a flourish , Dr. Jorgenson handed Maude a slip of paper . It read , Rx : one ice cream cone to be taken internally . Fill this prescription at the University Hospital Cafeteria . ASAP . <p> " Please , Momma ? " Maude said . Part of me was n't sure girls who swallowed quarters for a main course deserved dessert , but I was so grateful to have Maude unsedated , unintubated , I nodded . <p> " Sure , " I said . " But remember , Kyle 's waiting to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anders have heard from Lloyd about Bibi yet ? <p> We found the hospital cafeteria in the basement  --  were n't they always in the basement ? It smelled unpleasantly like dishwater and overcooked broccoli , but the lunch rush , if there was one , had n't started yet , and the large woman in the hairnet working the food line was happy to scoop Maude out a very large cookie dough cone . I grabbed a stack of napkins and followed Maude to a table near a row of dusty plastic plants . " Work on it a little , " I told Maude , watching my daughter digging the chocolate chips out of the ice cream with her tongue . " Then we 'll risk taking it in the car . " <p> I spotted a pay phone on the far wall . " Stay right here , sweetie . I 'm going to tell Dad you 're okay . " I got change for my wrinkled dollar from the cashier . The quarters looked huge in my hand . Would I ever look at one the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pay phone , and I stopped short , trying to signal I wanted to make a call , but not wanting to seem like I was listening in . <p> Luckily , it was a short conversation . " No . No . Okay , " the woman said . " All right , then , pick us up out front . " I smiled at the woman , looked into the carriage to smile at her baby as well . As a mother , I felt obligated to do that kind of thing . But the child in the carriage was much older than a baby , would have been a toddler if he had been able to walk . Twin oxygen tubes ran into his nostrils from a tank at his side . A blank rubbery expression filled his round face . I forced myself to smile anyway . The mother nodded at me as she pushed her son past . <p> I felt dizzy , but I made myself reach up to the receiver of the pay phone . Then I leaned forward , resting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a moment , I straightened . Maude was still sitting at the table , working hard on her cone . This was the first time Maude had ever been to an emergency room . She had never had more than a cold . Anders nothing worse than the flu . We had been living , were living , on the lucky side of the planet . Lucky , another word you could n't trust . We were lucky . The other people in this room  --  some trailing IVs from tall T-shaped stands , others just sitting wearily over Styrofoam cups of coffee , waiting for news that was not likely to be good  --  they , clearly , were not . <p> But if beauty could desert you , then so could luck . Was Bibi , across the highway in ambulatory care , still one of the lucky ones ? I thought of the boy in the baby carriage , then of blond , sweet , perpetually worried Kyle . I knew Bibi would say she had been lucky so far . Maybe that was the best any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . " Hello ? " Anders said . " We 're coming home , " I told him . <p> At the house , Kyle ran to greet Maude . No kid 's idea of a good time is spending Saturday with someone else 's parent . I told Anders the good news . " It might take as long as two weeks , " I said , repeating what Dr. Jorgenson had told me . " But unless Maude starts throwing up or running a fever , the quarter can be considered safely on its way . " <p> " Two weeks ? " Anders said . " After that long , it should come out two dimes and a nickel . " <p> I nodded , then belatedly realized he was making a joke and tried to smile . I had n't done anything all morning except sit around and wait , but I felt exhausted . " Did you hear from Lloyd ? " I asked . " Do they know anything yet ? " <p> " Yes , " Anders said , " and yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the living room couch . Maude was standing in front of him , tracing the path of the quarter with her finger . Anders lowered his voice . " It 's malignant . Lloyd said they want to do a lumpectomy , probably tomorrow . " <p> God , I thought , lumpectomy . What an ugly word . I knew , though , there were uglier ones . <p> " Then , " Anders was saying , " Bibi will to have choose between chemo or radiation . Apparently it 's her choice . I told Lloyd I 'd help him do some research on the Web tonight . " <p> I shook my head . Printouts about odds would never help Bibi decide what to do . Bibi was Bibi . I imagined her flipping a big gleaming quarter-heads I chose death rays , tails poison cocktails . <p> Anders looked at his watch . " Lloyd said he 'd be by for Kyle as soon as he got Bibi settled at the house . " <p> Kyle was looking at us , looking even whiter than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a chronic worrier , it must make a kind of perfect sense . He 'd been preparing for bad news all his life , and now it had arrived . <p> " Dad , Dad . " Maude was pulling on Anders 's arm . " I need you to put on some music . " <p> " What ? " Anders said , for once not on his daughter 's six-year-old wavelength . <p> " Kyle 's playing audience , and I 'm going to dance . " <p> " What kind of music ? " <p> Maude shrugged . " Dance music . " Anders put on the Supremes . Then , at Maude 's insistence , he sat on the couch next to Kyle . " Stop , in the name of love . " Maude was wiggling around , mouthing the words . <p> " No , no , " I said , " like this . " I spun into the routine I 'd learned from Bibi in our dorm days , one she and I had done in a sports bar on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stop ! " I held my hand out like a school crossing guard . " In the name of love . " I crossed my heart . Maude threw herself into it , wagging her finger along with me . " Before you break my heart . " I heard footsteps on the front porch . <p> " Come on in , Lloyd , " Anders called over the wall of sound . <p> " Nice moves . " It was Bibi , standing next to Lloyd , looking as if nothing had happened to her on this Saturday that had n't happened a thousand times before , as if under her sweater were no fresh stitches and , beneath them , no tumor , hard and hungry and growing . <p> " Auntie Bibi , " Maude said , catching her hand , pulling her into the middle of the room . " You dance , too . We 're a girl group . We 're ... " Maude paused , frowning with the effort of making up a name . " We 're The Beautiful Girls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead she smiled , began making the hand motions I remembered so well from the early years of our Beautiful Girl lives . As one , the three of us pivoted and turned and mouthed Diana Ross 's words as if nothing in this world could ever be less than lovely . As if there were no tragedy or loss , no unlucky quarters in stomachs , no blank-faced children who could n't breathe or walk , no ugly cancerous lumps . As if the world were all beauty and no beasts . Kyle and Anders on the couch gaped in amazement . Lloyd still standing , the long folds of his face damp from tears , sang along . Their girls were breaking their hearts . " Stop , " we girls sang . " Stop . " But , for now , there was no stopping us . <p> <p> By Jesse Lee Kercheval <p>
