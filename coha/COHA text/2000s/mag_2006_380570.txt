SMALL STEPS <P> LOUIS SACHAR <P> Maybe you remember a guy named Armpit from Sachar 's last book , Holes ? Big , muscular , convicted of assault ? You get to know him a lot better in Small Steps . He 's out of juvie and trying to go straight as a **28;19338;TOOLONG student . Unfortunately his buddy X-Ray ( another Holes alum ) gets him back into trouble over a ticket-scalping scheme . And when a chance meeting gets Armpit mixed up with a teen pop superstar ( the tickets were for her concert ) , things get complicated . It 's a fairy-tale setup , but Sachar gives his characters real emotions and real problems , and the result is a surprisingly wise book that never cloys or condescends . <P> THE PRETTY COMMITTEE STRIKES BACK <P> LISI HARRISON <P> This is book No. 5 in the Clique series , a fascinating , almost anthropological exploration of life in the popular girls ' set at a rich New York private school .

They 're scared of each other , but they 're stuck with each other  --  it 's like Sartre with lip gloss .

This does not surprise him . In his reality , dragons are in common use by the military ; popular breeds include Winchesters and Regal Coppers . But dragons bond at birth , and when the egg hatches at sea , our hero , Captain Laurence , must become the dragon 's rider  --  which distresses him , since , as everyone knows , " no woman of sense and character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurence 's induction into the strange , insular world of 19th century dragon riders and his unfolding relationship with his highly intelligent mount , Temeraire , make enthralling reading  --  it 's like Jane Austen playing Dungeons &; Dragons with Eragon 's Christopher Paolini . <P> THE BOOK THIEF <P> MARKUS ZUSAK For the enjoyment of your more ambitious young readers , a 552-page novel about a girl named Liesel living with her foster family in Nazi Germany , narrated by Death . But wait . If you can fight your way past the rather challenging first few pages , you will find that Liesel , whose hobby is stealing books , especially stealing banned books from the Nazis , is a heroine worth fighting for , and that Death is actually a pretty cool guy to hang out with ( " I like this human idea of the grim reaper , " he says , " I like the scythe " ) . Zusak does n't sugarcoat anything , but he makes his ostensibly gloomy subject bearable the same way Kurt Vonnegut did in Slaughterhouse-Five : with grim , darkly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
