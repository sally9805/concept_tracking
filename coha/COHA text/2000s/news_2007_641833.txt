<p> castle rock Many parents of dyslexic children say the students are left behind by Colorado public schools , forcing them to pay for costly private tutors to teach their children to read . <p> But parents expect more - for schools to teach every child to read , not just the ones who learn it quickly . <p> School districts " should n't be allowed to pick and choose the kids they help , which ones get to read , " said Adrienne Johnson , whose dyslexic stepdaughter attends a private school in Denver because of disputes with Aurora schools . <p> Dyslexia is considered the most common learning disability . The National Institutes of Health estimates one in five children has the disorder , where the sight , sound and meaning of words get scrambled in the circuitry of the brain . <p> The disorder varies , however , and many children go undiagnosed , so advocates and school officials disagree on the exact toll the disorder takes on education . <p> In May , 10 school officials from Meadow View Elementary School <p> in Castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-grader , Ryan . <p> She told them she believed he was dyslexic , just like his father and brother . Administrators told her they could n't determine that . <p> Instead , they gave her a list of her son 's problems jotted down on the back of an envelope : His fingers are stubby , he wo n't eat vegetables , he cries when his feelings are hurt , he does n't speak well , and he does n't read , spell or do math on par with his classmates . <p> School officials gave Wiser a short list of private child development clinics she could contact for help . <p> By the end , Wiser said , she was intimidated , distraught and desperate to spend whatever it took to teach her child to read . <p> Parents in Douglas County have banded together to try to change that . <p> The Douglas County Dyslexia Resource Group claims modest victories in forcing schools to provide more than the minimum requirements to educate children . <p> Last month , Douglas County became one of the first school districts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help detect dyslexia . <p> The school district , in a statement , also said it is " building capacity in personnel to provide specific interventions for students with any reading difficulty . " <p> Children with severe dyslexia often wind up in special education , and standardized tests show marked improvements when underachieving kids enter school-funded programs , according to the Colorado Department of Education . <p> Still , Colorado sported a dismal 46.8 percent graduation rate among students with learning disabilities , according to the state Department of Education 's latest performance plan from the federal government . The graduation rate for all students was 80.1 percent . <p> Meanwhile , parents who can afford it must pay thousands of dollars a month for tuition at private schools with advanced reading programs or pay a tutor more than $100 an hour to visit several times a week , teaching sometimes in school libraries and vacant lunchrooms . <p> The Wisers spent $2,000 for a test to confirm what they suspected - Ryan is dyslexic . <p> Renee Wiser is a stay-at-home mom with three kids . Her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children diagnosed with dyslexia , and a third exhibiting warning signs , the family ca n't afford much outside help . <p> " I 've begged these people with tears in my eyes , " Wiser said , " ' Teach my child to read , teach my child to read . " ' <p> Though federal law requires every child with a disability to receive a " free , appropriate public education , " courts have allowed local school districts to define " appropriate . " <p> School districts across the country have argued that " appropriate " does not mean " the best , " but rather what schools can afford to provide . <p> " I can not honestly tell you of one school or district where if you were to use the word dyslexia , you would get much of an informed or positive answer , " said Elenn Steinberg , present of the Rocky Mountain branch of the International Dyslexia Association , and the parent of a child with dyslexia . <p> Schools contend that the most severe cases of dyslexia require clinical help that public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnose ; we 're not medical professionals , " said Alex Sanchez , a spokesman for Denver Public Schools . <p> That common reply from school districts is " a dodge , " said Meredith Puls , who has taught hundreds of dyslexic children to read over a 20-year career at Children 's Hospital . <p> " Yes , it 's a medical diagnosis . . It 's a diagnosis of a reading disability , " she said . " One of the fundamental things schools do is teach kids to read . " <p> Schools say they are not well- <p> equipped to help the significantly dyslexic child . Reading instruction must be intense , highly systematic and prolonged , and usually one-on-one for up to 90 minutes at a time , experts said . <p> Ed Steinberg , a former special education teacher who heads the Colorado Department of Education 's special education unit , said parents have a right to expect a good education for their children , and teachers and schools who fail to teach children to read are n't meeting that obligation . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers need to properly teach reading , " he said . <p> Cali Nichols of Castle Rock knew there was a problem before her youngest son , Grady , ever stepped foot in a school building . He was n't learning at the same pace as his brother , Max , who is two years older . <p> Nichols found no allies in the school system . <p> " They said , ' Oh , it 's nothing ; he 'll grow out of it , " ' she recalled . <p> When she pressed the issue , a district administrator told her to teach her child to read at home . Three days a week , paid tutor Kathy Root teaches Grady to read . <p> Root , a former public school teacher , said administrators must change their " world view " on classroom teaching to reach more students with difficulties . <p> " These kids are not broken ; they do n't need to be fixed , " she said . " The schools need to be fixed .
