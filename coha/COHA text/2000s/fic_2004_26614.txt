The Oracle Betrayed The First House Of the Sting of the God Even gods dream . I dream of water , of how it falls , the plop of the great hot drops on the desert , the hollow pits they make in the sand ; how the parched land drinks them instantly . I am a god ; my dreams should come true . But then , water is different , water is she , and there 's no control over her . I think I have lines on my body , and great scorched places and pustules that burn like volcanoes . Or sores . Or deserts . I puzzle myself . Am I single or double ? Light or light 's shadow ? And the tunnel leads up to the world and I climb and scuttle through it , and come to where you live . And one of the problems of divinity is that people expect something huge and powerful . And an instant result . She Speaks to the Archon The Procession was at least halfway down the terraces before Mirany stopped trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly through the eye slits ; the mask was too big , the slits too far apart . And in the sweltering heat , the dust rising in clouds , the flies , the shimmering mirage of the road , everything was bewildering . She flipped hair out of her eyes , tight with dread , her whole body sheened with sweat . Just as the back strap on her sandal started to chafe , the Procession shuffled to a stop . They had reached the Oracle . Rattles , drums , and zithers were silenced on one note . In the terrible still heat , Chryse whispered , " My arms are burning . " She had oddly fair skin . Maybe , generations back , her people came from the mountains . " Put anything on them ? " Mirany said breathlessly . " Aloe oil . " " That wo n't help . " Her voice was tight . Through the mask of the Taster-for-the-God , Chryse looked at her kindly . " Do n't be scared , Mirany . You 'll be all right . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long ranks of troops were clanking to a halt , glittering in their bronze , their general , Argelin , grim on his white horse , and in front of them the six men that carried the Archon 's litter had paused , too , lowering the golden canopy thankfully onto the track , rubbing their aching shoulders . The old man must be heavy . But then , he would n't be going back . The Speaker turned . " Mirany . " The great mask she wore was the only one of the Nine with an open mouth . It muffled her voice ; made the familiar name sound strange , a breathy , unfamiliar summons . As if the god was speaking then , for a moment . Until she snapped , " Follow me . Only you , " and it was Hermia again , acid and watchful , and Mirany saw her eyes gleam dark through the narrow slits . Giving the end of the garland to Chryse , Mirany stepped out , silent . She felt shriveled with dread , sick with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cobbles tightly placed together , and was n't straight but wound round into the olive trees through a doorway of three great stones . On the smooth lintel the scorpion and the snake were carved , fighting their eternal battle . Uneasy , Mirany glanced up at them . She had passed the doorway many times , but had never entered it . The Speaker , already through , turned , impatient . " Quickly ! " Mirany took a deep breath , and followed . She was in the enclosure of the Oracle . They walked down the path . In the sizzling heat Hermia said , " Are you afraid ? " " Should I be ? " Mirany whispered . The mask swiveled . " I 'll assume that was a serious question , and not impudence . Indeed you should . Yours is a dangerous honor for a girl so inexperienced . " She knew that . She had never , never thought it would be her . When Alana had died , all the girls had whispered about who would be next Bearer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her she 'd been chosen , she had n't been able to believe it . Neither had anyone else . The terror had come later , growing all day . Now , despite the heat , her hands were so chilled she could hardly feel them , so she rubbed them together and asked the question she already knew the answer to . " Will I be doing it today ? Carrying the god ? " " If he wills it . " Hermia sounded amused . Fear tasted sour . A prickling , her heart thudding , and that sickening , sweating emptiness . She swallowed a huge lump of it in her throat but it was still there , choking her , and the gold and scarlet mask was a stifling hand over her breathlessness . Up here the noise of the Procession had faded ; it was as if the path under the stone door had led them both abruptly out of the Island into another , hushed place , where only cicadas hissed in the prickly furze . Stumbling , Mirany felt a sticky strand of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it always did . Then she thought , All right , so you 're terrified . But at least you 'll see the Oracle . The others had arguments , in the Lower House , late at night . About whether the Oracle was a statue that spoke or a spring that bubbled up out of the ground . Whether it thundered with a roaring voice , or whispered like leaves in the wind , while Hermia went into a trance and moaned and shrieked . Too shy to join in , Mirany had listened , and thought her secret , wicked thought . Now she 'd finally see . But she 'd never be allowed to tell them about it . Juniper and stunted bushes of thyme and artemisia scorched the heat with scent . The path coiled round on itself like a sleeping snake , and the underbrush stirred and crackled with the god 's life , small scurryings , slither of scales , the quick green scuttle of a lizard.                  @ @ @
