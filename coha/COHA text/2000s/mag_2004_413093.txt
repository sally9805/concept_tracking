Be sure that their PCs have a good data-recovery application in place . Windows Me and XP have the reliable though rudimentary System Restore feature ; but for older operating systems , you 'll need a third-party utility such as Symantec 's Go-Back 3 ( $40 ; www.symantec.com ) . Make a list of simple fixes for people to try before they dial your number .

FREEBSES HAVF LiMlTS IF THE FREE ADVICE does n't work , there are plenty of fee-based tech support sites to consult for phone or online chat help , but they can be pricey . Before you recommend one to Mom , make sure that both of you understand the fee structure . Some sites charge per incident , with rates typically starting at about $25 per call . Others charge by the minute ( the sites I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Make sure that the site offers a free estimate before it starts the clock , and check the details of its guarantee .
