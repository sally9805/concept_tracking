My father had a farm on the western side of Missouri , below the river , where the Ozark Plateau levels to join the plains . This is a region cut by creeks , where high pastures rise out of wooded valleys to catch the sunlight and fall away over limestone bluffs . It is a pretty country . It does not demand your admiration , as some regions do , but seems glad for it all the same . It repays you with serenity , corn and persimmons , blackberries , black walnuts , bluegrass and wild roses . A provident land , in its modest way . The farm lay in its heart two hundred acres on a slow brown stream called Little Tebo . <p> The nineteenth century had not yet ended when my parents , Matthew and Callie Soames , first came to the farm . They arrived newlywedded , with a teakettle , a featherbed , and a span of mules . Later they went to live in a small town , where my father taught school . Sometimes they came back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home to stay . They painted the house and propped up the old gray barn , bought a bull and a butane tank , and lived here the year around , as happy as if they were hale and twenty instead of a frail old pair who would not see seventy again . <p> My sisters and I used to visit them on the farm . We came each summer  --  Jessica from deep in the Ozarks , Leonie from a little town in Kansas , and I from New York , where I worked in television , then a new industry , very mysterious to my family . To me , and somewhat to my sisters , these visits were like income tax , an annual inconvenience . There were always so many other ways we could have spent the time . But , old as we were , our parents were still the government . They levied the tribute and we paid it . <p> Once we got there , we were happy enough . We lapsed easily into the old ways , cracked the old jokes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat and lazy . It was a time of placid unreality . The lives we lived outside were suspended , the affairs of the world forgotten and our common blood remembered . No matter that our values differed now , that we had gone our separate ways ; when we met like this on familiar ground , we enjoyed one another . <p> I remember particularly a summer in the early fifties . Jessica 's husband and Leonie 's had stayed behind that year , one was a farmer , the other a mechanic , and neither could get away at the time . Only Leonie 's boy had come with her . Soames was a tall , beautiful , disconsolate child who had just turned eighteen . In a few weeks he was leaving to join the Air Force , and Leonie could hardly bear it . Once he was gone , there was so much he would have left undone , so much unsaid , that neither of them would ever again have a chance to do or say . It was a sad time for them . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was still going on in Korea . The war itself troubled us deeply , and it gave his leaving a special gravity . We could not think of one without the other . And yet , here in deep country , remote from the outside world , it was possible , for the moment , to think of neither . There was no daily paper . Nobody bothered with the radio . The little news that came our way seemed unreal and no concern of ours . Only the planes roaring over each day from an airbase on the north reminded us of danger , and soon even they lost their menace . Their shadows slipped across the pasture and yard like the shadows of clouds , hardly more sinister . The farm was a little island in a sea of summer . And a faraway war where young men were dying troubled us less than the shooting of one old man . <p> This had happened close to home , a mile or two up the road . A recluse farmer named Corcoran had been shot by his only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My parents found the old man the next morning , rolled under a bed like a rug in summer and left there to die . He was still , though barely , alive . They drove him twenty miles to a hospital , my mother sitting in the back seat with the old man 's head in her lap . <p> All this had taken place just before our arrival . On our last day but one , we were still talking about it . <p> " Poor old thing , " said my mother , " be a blessing if he could die . " <p> " Yes , it would , " said my father . " Nobody to care for him at all . " <p> " He was a grouchy old thing , but he does n't deserve to suffer . " <p> " How old is he ? " I said . <p> " He must be seventy , at least , " said my mother . The way she talked , he could have been her grandfather . <p> " Have they caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Wonder how come him to do that . " <p> " I do n't know , " said my father . " Some say the old man was pretty hard on him . " <p> " There were all kinds of tales ! " my mother said . " About his daddy chainin ' him in the smokehouse and all that . I never believed ' em . " <p> " Idle gossip , " said Dad . " The old man had a way of antagonizing people and they had to get back at him . He was rough and crude in his ways , but he was n't mean . " <p> " No , he was n't . The boy was just odd , that 's all . He was n't quite right . I do n't know how he got into the army . " <p> " It figures . " Soames grinned and got up . <p> " Oh , you 're a sight ! " Mama said , patting him on the seat of his jeans . " My goodness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symposium on neighborhood violence . We pulled ourselves up from the table , all of us stupefied with food . We had dined on roast tenderloin , peas in pure cream , sliced green tomatoes browned in butter , and burnt-sugar cake for dessert . My mother set a country table , and dinner was at noon . <p> <br> Continues ...
