Probing lively puzzles on the Red Planet <p> Just 2 months ago , Mars loomed high in the sky , its ruddy countenance so close that anyone with a backyard telescope could make out the planet 's white south-polar cap and a central smudge known as Syrtis Major . Not in 60,000 years had Mars and Earth been so close , and they wo n't be again for another 2 centuries . But even as the two planets now drift slowly apart , three envoys from Earth are racing to the Red Planet . <p> If all goes according to plan , the European Space Agency 's Mars Express will begin orbiting Mars next month , using radar to search for hidden reservoirs of water . The craft will also jettison a suitcase-size stationary lander , Beagle-2 , that will look for signs of life by examining soil at and just below the surface of a region called Isidis Planitia . <p> Then , in January two NASA craft bearing identical rovers , named Spirit and Opportunity , will touch down in regions of the planet that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hosted primitive life . <p> " Successful landings of all three spacecraft will more than double our experience with the . . . environments of Mars , " says James B. Garvin , NASA 's Mars-program scientist in Washington , D.C. " I am anticipating major breakthroughs in our understanding . " <p> Planetary scientists studying Mars could use a breakthrough . Recent evidence has shaken what has been one of the most tantalizing core beliefs about the Red Planet  --  that ancient Mars was much wetter and warmer than the planet is today and even harbored a planetwide ocean . <p> On the one hand , the planet 's now bone-dry surface is scarred by sinuous channels , apparent lake beds , deep canyons , and thousands of gullies . These all bear the marks of having been carved by liquid water . On the other hand , there 's a troubling scarcity of minerals such as limestone and other carbonates , which commonly form in the presence of liquid water . <p> There is a " direct conflict " between the geological and mineralogical evidence for water on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado in Boulder . <p> Determining whether parts of Mars ever carried a substantial amount of liquid water and , if so , for how long would help answer the ultimate question about the Red Planet : Is it now or has it ever been a living world ? <p> MISSING MINERALS The water conundrum intensified late last summer , when Philip R. Christensen of the Arizona State University in Tempe and his colleagues reported the results of a 6-year study with an infrared spectrometer aboard the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor observatory . The instrument scrutinized large swaths of the Martian surface and atmosphere for carbonates , minerals that are associated with water . On Earth , carbonates such as limestone form when carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in water , making carbonic acid . The acid eats away at rocks , and their remains precipitate out as carbonate deposits . A notable example is the White Cliffs of Dover . <p> Researchers had been looking for carbonates on Mars for more than a decade , and in the Aug. 22 Science , Christensen 's team announced that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoice . Carbonates were detected in only small amounts  --  up to 5 percent  --  in the planet 's surface dust . <p> " We believe that the relatively small amounts that we see probably did not come from oceans , but from trace amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere interacting directly with dust , " Christensen says . <p> This study , as well as other new evidence ( see page 301 ) , " really points to a cold , frozen , icy Mars that has probably always been that way , as opposed to a warm , humid , oceanic Mars some time in the past , " Christensen adds . The extensive carbonate layers that would have formed early in Martian history if the climate had been warm and oceans plentiful " are simply not there , " he says . <p> There maybe geologic processes that could have hidden or transformed carbonates at the Martian surface to make them undetectable from orbit , acknowledges Chris Chyba of the SETI Institute in Mountain View , Calif . However , he says , " unless and until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we should take the data at face value . " <p> ROVING FOR WATER The evidence that Chyba seeks can come only from spacecraft that land . On the surface , their instruments can search for carbonates and other water-derived minerals , along with water-carved features , on scales far finer than those at which an orbiting observatory can investigate . NASA 's rovers will explore two strikingly disparate places . Both regions appear to have had an encounter with liquid water but have different tales to tell about their aquatic past , says Steve Squyres of Cornell University . His team built the twin rovers ' array of instruments . <p> " We think these will be the most exciting landed missions of exploration since the Apollo program , " declares NASAs Garvin . Each vehicle is about five times as large as its diminutive cousin , Sojourner , which on July 4,1997 , became the first rover on the Red Planet . <p> Compared with Sojourner 's single scientific instrument , an X-ray spectrometer , each of the new rovers has nine cameras , three spectrometers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition of the rocks , while a microscope manager at the end of the arm will act like a hand lens , revealing the texture and shape of minerals . Like the Beagle-2 , each rover also has a scraper that can remove about half a millimeter of material  --  about the thickness of a nickel  --  from the surface of rocks covered with dust or other debris . The solar-powered , all-terrain vehicles can travel about 40 meters a day , compared with Sojourner 's 1 meter . Researchers expect them to explore rocks for at least 3 months , about the same as Sojourner 's life span . <p> On Jan. 3 , Spirit , the first of the two $400-million rovers , will descend along with its mother ship into Gusev crater , a 160-kilometerwide crater that appears to have a dried-up riverbed running into it . " We 'll look for lake sediment or sea sediment  --  the rocks that may have been deposited by running water and that may have been entombed there , " says Garvin . Spirit 's close-up examination will seek sedimentary layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock was chemically altered by water that vanished long ago . <p> WATER AND HEMATITE Three weeks after the spacecraft carrying Spirit lands , the second NASA craft and its rover , dubbed Opportunity , will touch down at the edge of a smooth plain called Meridiani Planum . <p> Here , the hunt for evidence of past water will primarily rely on chemistry . The region is one of two places on Mars covered with a vast deposit of hematite , a gray , crystalline iron oxide that on Earth usually forms in the presence of water . ( A ubiquitous , finer-grained version of the same oxide gives Mars its rusty-red hue . ) Observations of Meridiani Planum from orbit suggest that the ' gray hematite was deposited by a watery source , perhaps an ancient and vast hot spring . <p> The rover 's capacity to examine the texture and distribution of the hematite , even its microscopic grain structure , will be critical in determining how the material and related minerals got there , notes James F. Bell of Cornell . <p> Christensen has proposed several scenarios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of water . <p> In one scenario , the hematite is but one layer of a band of iron-rich mineral deposits , like the iron-oxide bands seen in Lake Superior and other large standing bodies of water on Earth . The bands form when dissolved iron particles combine with oxygen and precipitate out as layers of hematite . <p> Each layer , says Christensen , demarcates a significant climate change , such as a dramatic difference in the temperature of the water or the concentration of oxygen in it . " If you get to the planet , and you pick up a rock and it has some banded layers of hematite in it , that 's a smoking gun for a lake deposit . " <p> A second explanation for the hematite centers on massive amounts of rain or snow that may have dissolved minerals in the topmost layer of the region . Hematite might then have recrystallized in a deeper layer . Millions of years of wind erosion may have brought that once-buried layer to the surface . If that 's the case , then the rover should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which minerals were dissolved away , as well as iron-rich ones . <p> Or maybe water had nothing to do with hematite . The material could have arisen when iron-rich volcanic eruptions interacted with oxygen in the atmosphere . If so , Opportunity will find the hematite to be a fine-grained ash dispersed uniformly through the rocks the rover analyzes , Christensen says . <p> If Opportunity finds that hematite is merely a surface coating , like the rust on a junkyard car , it could mean that the rocks were exposed to water for only a short amount of time or simply interacted with trace amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere . <p> Magnified images that reveal the specific shapes of mineral will provide additional clues to the origin of the iron oxides at either landing site , notes Bell . For instance , large , rounded grains of hematite suggest transport by a flow of water , while fine , flatter grains point toward the rust-formation mechanism . <p> Christensen says his favorite explanation for the hematite at Meridiani Planum is that a warm or hot spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests , could have come from a frozen lake covering layers of iron-bearing sediment . If some underground heat source , such as an erupting volcano , melted the ice , the water would have percolated through the sediment . If this scenario holds true , Opportunity " would see a hematite cement " filling in the rock pores , Christensen says . <p> Even if the hematite 's origin remains ambiguous , trace amounts of other minerals could serve as additional markers of past water . Consider goethite , the water-bearing iron mineral named for the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , who dabbled in mineralogy . Goethite formation requires water , and the mineral , when heated , can slowly convert to hematite . Small amounts of goethite would clinch a watery origin for the hematite at Meridiani Planum . <p> There is at least one way that liquid water could have been present on Mars without leaving behind carbonate fingerprints . Proposed by Christensen and other planetary scientists , this hypothesis could have important implications for future missions to Mars , especially in determining where to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer in the past  --  just above - 20 Celsius instead of today 's average of - 60 Celsius  --  frozen water could liquefy as thin films at the boundary between layers of ice and dust , Jakosky notes . At that temperature , the chemical reactions that would lead to the formation of carbonates proceed so slowly that little carbonate would be made before the water refroze . <p> Supporting this idea , Christensen notes that many of the features on Mars that appear to have been sculpted by flowing water , including channels , do n't require liquid water to last very long or to cover vast stretches of the planet . For example , the sudden melting of a reservoir of ice , creating a flash flood lasting for just a few weeks on a section of the Martian surface , would suffice to create <p> NEW SYNTHESIS , NEW MISSIONS Brief interludes when water was liquid also seem to have occurred recently . A camera aboard the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft spied thousands of gullies at high latitudes where water would typically be frozen but under some circumstances could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blemishes typically acquired by older surfaces , the gullies look remarkably young , suggesting that water flowed there as recently as a few million years ago . <p> Such episodic flows would permit dormant organisms " to revive and repair themselves every few million years , " Jakosky and his colleagues argue in the summer 2003 Astrobiology . Studies of life in extreme environments on Earth suggest that , " even at very low temperatures that would allow metabolism but not necessarily growth , organisms could effectively reset any damaged systems , including DNA , and thus allow very long-term survival , " the team says . " Mars today appears to be right at the edge of being habitable by microorganisms . " <p> According to this hypothesis , some of the best places to look for life  --  or its remains  --  have vast reserves of ice . These promising regions include the north and south poles of the planet , according to data gathered by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft . Because the tilt of Mars 's polar axis dips as much as 60 every million years of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the not-so-distant past . At such places , a lander or rover might discover primitive life or its vestiges in the topmost layers of ice , says Jakosky . Last summer , NASA announced plans to launch a lander to the north-polar regions of Mars in 2007 . <p> " At the same time that evidence is accumulating that early Mars may globally not have been very warm , evidence is also accumulating that contemporary Mars still intermittently has water flowing on its surface in specific locations , " says Chyba . " There are over 100 locations where water seems to have flowed recently , " he notes . It will be fascinating to see what the rover missions tell us . " <p> Back at NASA , Garvin says he is looking forward to what could be the most nerve-wracking 6 minutes of his life . That 's when the first rover and its mother ship will careen through the Martian atmosphere at 20,000 kilometers per hour with only a cocoon of airbags to cushion their fall . Says Garvin : " We 'll all be on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : RED ROVING  --  After bouncing to a stop , the lander 's petals will unfold and the Mars Exploration Rover will drive onto the surface . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : HOLE-Y SITE  --  Mars ' Gusev crater , a 160-kilometer-wide hole in the ground , is the landing site of the NASA craft that will touch down Jan. 3 , 2004 .
