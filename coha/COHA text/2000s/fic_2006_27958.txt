One Night with a Spy By Bradley , Celeste St. Martin 's Paperbacks Bradley , Celeste England , 1813 Three years later Husbands came and husbands went , but dreadful hair lasted forever . Julia , now the widowed Lady Barrowby , forced one last curling strand back into her severely restrained hairstyle and settled the black veil over it all . Her beloved Aldus had lingered for three long years in his efforts to stay with her after his initial collapse and although he 'd been more mentor than husband , she had sworn to mourn him for one entire day before she took on the task he had set her . Just as he 'd wished , she had buried him today with no more fanfare than the baker of the nearby village of Middlebarrow might have received . Now , she must pull herself together and dry her tears , for the moment had come . With a sigh , she saw that another pale wisp had come loose . Her hair refused to adapt to the role of highborn lady , a last holdout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shoved the blasted thing into submission once again , using her customary excess of pins . At last , she was ready to face down the three intimidating lords who had gathered uninvited in her front parlor . She pressed her fingertips to the locket about her neck for a moment , then she turned and walked calmly from her bedchamber . All about Marcus there was chaos in the yard of the coaching inn . The impromptu visit from the Prince Regent ofEngland had sent the innkeeper into fits of near-fainting and the people of this anonymous village into goggle-eyed ineptitude . There was noise and madness everywhere as he tried to get his highness back on the road , but deep inside him , there was a place of suspended silence . Marcus Ramsay , Lord Dryden , was waiting . Outwardly , he seemed well enough occupied by his duties protecting the Prince Regent and securing his prince 's safe journey from Kirkall Hall in Scotland to Brighton -- -George IV 's preferred winter destination . There was the prince 's new mistress to consider , and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitchen Foray than any one man could possibly need , and yet somehow Prince George still overworked them all . Marcus 's duties to his demanding monarch aside , there still remained a portion of Marcus 's mind that sat in that still , frozen moment of anticipation . He 'd been waiting all his life , it seemed . The second son of a marquess , one boy child too many to hope for more than Ravencliff , the minor estate left to him by his mother 's dowry , he 'd spent his youth wondering what the world would have left for him . He 'd spent his years in the army , hoping for the answers there , but mere combat did n't hold any thrill but the unpleasant one of danger itself . Marcus did n't want to be the man taking the hill , he wanted to be the man to choose the hill . His vision seemed to extend beyond that of his general , as if he could see the field of battle from an eagle 's view , as if he could outthink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for them to see what he saw , until he 'd not been able to wait any longer . He 'd been so frustrated by the useless waste of life perpetrated by shortsighted men -- -the men who chose the hills . Finally , unable to bear one more day of slaughter for slaughter 's sake , he 'd salted his commander 's meal with a powerful emetic and left the man puking out his ignorance and stubbornness in the company 's latrine . Taking command through lies and persuasion , though he was a mere major , Marcus led his command through the gaping weakness in the side of the French army that somehow he 'd been the only one to see . They 'd taken the hill without a single loss . He 'd been accused , tried , and acquitted -- -for no one could quite prove he 'd done what he 'd done , nor could they deny its effectiveness . He 'd been ordered from the army with a black mark on his record and a furtive , fervent thank-you from his men . The next day , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant of a man had appeared at his doorstep and offered him the chance of a lifetime . Someday . Someday he would take over as the Lion , someday he would assume a seat on the council of analysts and spies who held the reins of England in their hands -- -the Cobra , the Lion , the Fox , and the Falcon . Men whose deathless loyalty to England superseded even their loyalty to their king . Someday -- -provided his youthful and very lively mentor died before him . Nor did Marcus wish Dane Calwell dead . The man was more brother than teacher , more friend than superior . But the Viscount Greenleigh had given Marcus the taste of a future full of promise and power -- -not to glorify himself , but to change the world . To be a man who ruled kings -- -to be able to use the vision he had , the mind he 'd been given , the strength in his spirit for something more meaningful than spending his inheritance and waiting for his brother to kill himself with overindulgence ? Now that was a future he could scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised him , seemingly for the hundredth time . " You 're almost ready , but not quite . You 're too impulsive yet , too reckless . Yes , you saved the lives of potentially hundreds of soldiers -- -but you did it rashly , without thorough deliberation . You might have killed more than you saved . Take this time to cultivate some restraint -- -for you 'll need more than you know . " Wait . Always wait . Marcus had bitten his tongue , he 'd beaten down his ambitions , he 'd settled into his role as protg of the Lion . Or so he 'd thought . Marcus closed his eyes against the chaos of the inn yard . He should not allow himself to savor the excitement and satisfaction rising within him , yet he could not contain it . The waiting was nearly done . Even now , the Cobra , the Lion , and the Falcon journeyed to Barrowby , home of the Fox . All Marcus need do now was reach for a last bit of patience in a life filled with " wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dream -- -a seat in the ring of power . A seat on the Royal Four . For the unthinkable had happened . The Fox had died without apprentice . And the Royal Four were only Three . In the most formal and luxurious parlor of Barrowby , consternation reigned . For the first time in the history of that elite and powerful cabal that steered the course of England 's past , present , and future , one of the Royal Four had neglected his most sacred duty . The three lords , most concerned , accompanied by a very edge Prime Minister , had set themselves the task of discovering which deserving gentleman had been selected by their venerable peer before his death . At that moment , this task seemed futile . He had not trained a replacement . More vital than an heir to a mere title , more important than even an heir to the Crown -- -for when had England ever had any shortage of those lying about ?  - -  - the lacking heir to the seat of the Fox left the Four vulnerable to defeat from within . Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jilly " to her long-dead mother , " Julia " to her recently deceased husband , stood in the front hallway of Barrowby and listened without shame to the conversation being had in the first parlor . It was her house , after all -- -at least until the distant heir to Barrowby could be found . And , although the four men in the parlor knew it not , their conversation concerned her greatly . The crisp , slightly nasal voice of Lord Liverpool , the Prime Minister of England , was unmistakable . " I can not believe Aldus could have been so careless ! He had nearly forty years as the Fox to select a protg -- -it is not possible . There must be someone -- -perhaps someone who tired of waiting and went about his business . " Not bloody likely , Julia thought . A deep and powerful rumble disagreed with Lord Liverpool . That would be the blond giant , Lord Greenleigh , who held the seat of the Lion . " I have never heard of someone choosing not to serve once selected -- -and do n't give me Etheridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Barrowby can not have believed he still had time , " said a smoother voice thoughtfully . Julia guessed at Lord Reardon , the new Cobra . " He was over seventy years of age ! " The fourth man , Lord Wyndham , had not said much at all . Nor would he . Julia was well aware of the Falcon 's cool , watchful nature . Aldus had prepared her well . " You 'd not have had a chance among the old roosters I served with , " Aldus had told her , back when he 'd been lucid nearly all of the time . " This new crop of fellows . . . perhaps they are of a more modern bent . " Yet , he 'd not truly believed it , she had known even then . Hoping was not the same as believing . Julia believed . She had based the last five years of her life on believing . Now the time had come to put that belief to the test . She straightened , patted her hair once more just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With luck , the carved oak had left no discernible impression upon her cheek . At the curt invitation -- -obviously Lord Liverpool had thought her to be a servant -- -she entered the parlor . The four men looked up in surprise and hastily stood . " Lady Barrowby ! " Lord Reardon bowed . He was easily recognizable from his appearances in Sir Thorogood 's political cartoons . The other three bowed as well , although their expressions were less welcoming . Julia decided at once that she approved of Reardon . She was not so sure about Greenleigh and Wyndham . Liverpool she knew too well to approve of . She curtsied . " My lords . " Liverpool stepped forward . Julia noticed that he did not come close to her . Perhaps he came close to no one -- -or perhaps he was unwilling to draw attention to the fact that she stood inches above him . Not vanity , she knew . Liverpool 's motives were ever rooted in power . How odd to see them all in person at last . Liverpool cleared his throat . " Lady Barrowby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief -- - " He did n't sound any too penitent to Julia . " I wonder if you could tell us of any particular companion your husband might have had in his last years . A younger man , perhaps -- -a member of the aristocracy ? " Julia could answer that question with complete honesty . " No , my lord , I could not . Aldus has -- -had not seen anyone outside of our household in years . " Still , there was no point in keeping them in distress . Breathe in , breathe out . " Gentlemen , the fellow you seek does not exist . There is no younger man . There is only me . " She paused . Swallowed . Met their confused gazes with a serenity that did not truly exist . " I am the Fox . " The uproar was immediate and unpleasant . Julia maintained her composure until the four men had sputtered and exclaimed and denied enough . She cleared her throat . They fell more or less silent , although if Liverpool did not cease swearing beneath his breath , someone might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am not requesting that you allow me to be the Fox . I am informing you that I am the Fox , and have been for the past three years . I know everything that my husband knew , and considerably more than any of you , excepting the Prime Minister , of course . " Liverpool sputtered . " Rampant falsehoods , all of it ! I have been dealing with Barrowby for years ! We came into the Four within a few years of each other . When I stepped down to become Prime Minister last year , it was after extensive correspondence with Aldus . I would have known had I not been dealing with him ! " She folded her arms . " You have been corresponding with me , Robert . I could prove it , but I do not think you would wish me to . I know more about you than merely the gossip one might read in the newssheets . " Liverpool went entirely still . " You tread dangerous ground , my girl . " She tilted her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , ' but I shall let that familiarity pass for such an intimate acquaintance . " Liverpool did not respond . It was obvious that he was thinking very hard , and even more obvious that one would not like to know what he was thinking . Not that she required a map . She knew these men , even the most recent member , Lord Reardon , better than their mothers could . Julia turned to the other Three . " May I congratulate you on your recent marriage , Lord Greenleigh ? I wish you and your intrepid lady the best . " Dane Calwell nodded graciously , but his eyes were narrowed . " You seem rather well informed , my lady , for being isolated at Barrowby for so long . " Julia nodded . " Indeed , I have found it necessary to set up my own network of informants . I could hardly take my case to the Liar 's Club , could I ? " " So you admit to hiding the truth from us ? " Liverpool was quick to sniff out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted her chin . " I imagined your response and acted accordingly . Aldus wished to remain the Fox until he could no longer function as thus . He entrusted me to decide for him when that time was . " She was unable to hold back a sigh . " It came so much sooner than we 'd feared . " There was not a flicker of sympathy in the granite expressions before her . Never mind . She would not fail Aldus . He had believed in her ability to hold the Fox 's position , even to preparing her for this moment . " They 'll test your mettle , " Aldus had told her . " You wo n't know where it will come from or when , but you can count on being set with some sort of trial . " He 'd patted her hand . " No sense in worrying over it yet . Not a thing you can do but prove to the lot of them that you 're made of good stern stuff . " So far , only her carpets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too young ! " The Prime Minister was not going to give up easily . Julia smiled gently at him . " There is a precedent . The eleventh Falcon assumed his seat at the age of nineteen in the reign of King Henry VI . I was all of twenty when I did so . " The Falcon nodded slightly . " That is so . " His eyes gave away nothing . Julia nodded respectfully in reply . " I realize that this is a shock to you all . You will require some time to adjust to the notion of a woman in the Royal Four . " She curtsied and turned to leave the room . " Yet , pray do not forget this . " She stopped and looked at them over her shoulder . " There is no one else . " She left , closing the door behind her . She made it around the corner of the hallway before the stiffening left her knees and they began to shake uncontrollably . She 'd done it . She 'd faced down the four most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing she had done so far as the Fox compared to this moment . She felt terrified and exhilarated and calm , all at the same moment . She knew they would do their best to deny her . Liverpool was particularly dangerous , for he 'd not taken kindly to her dig about the gossip . Then again , she doubted any of the others would stop at eliminating her if they truly believed her to be a danger . It was up to her to convince them that she knew what she was about . Being female had no influence on her mind or her loyalty . " Oh , Aldus , " she whispered , tipping her forehead against the cool wall . " You should have seen their expressions . " A small , rusty breathless laugh broke through her reserve . " I wish I could see it again , myself . " Beppo rounded the corner , obviously looking for her . Julia straightened and nodded at the small wiry butler , her practiced composure instantly back in place . " Yes , Beppo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the parlor , my lady . At your convenience , of course . " Beppo , who had come late in life to the serving of the " Quality , " had added that last bit on himself , she was sure . " Their lordships " had n't seemed too terribly concerned with her convenience . She lifted her chin and closed her eyes for a long moment . Grace under fire . She returned to the parlor to find the four men ranged like a firing squad , facing her . Fire , indeed . From the glare in Lord Liverpool 's eyes , she rather thought brimstone might also be in her future . " Gentlemen , have you come to the obvious conclusion ? " Careful . She might have the upper hand , but they 'd never work with her if she alienated them completely . Lord Reardon bowed . " My lady , I fear the only conclusion we have come to is that we can not currently come to a conclusion . We request a fortnight to deliberate upon it . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who might be voting on her side -- -Reardon and Greenleigh ? The two were reportedly very happily wed . They would likely have a higher opinion of a lady 's abilities . So . . . it was the Prime Minister , of course , and the sharply handsome Lord Wyndham . She curtsied low in return . " Then I shall remain here at Barrowby to await your verdict , my lords . " If someone had been watching -- -and someone was -- -they would have seen four very thoughtful men leaving the grand house of Barrowby . Now what in that house might have brought about such pensive brows ? The afternoon sun glanced off shining golden hair , drawing the watcher 's attention to the woman standing at the top of the grand steps , watching her guests leave . His gaze passed over her , then was drawn sharply back . No . There was an unfamiliar sensation in the watcher 's midsection . He spared a moment to analyze the feeling , only to determine that it was deep and bone-chilling shock . He slipped silently through the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must know . . . She turned slightly , lifting her face to the day and letting her shoulders droop wearily for a moment . He could see her clearly now -- -the same eyes , the same chin , the same shimmering hair . It was impossible . How could this be ? More to the point , what had she to do with the men who were now riding away ? After he 'd followed them thus far the truth seemed no clearer . She was obviously the lady of the house and she wore black , so she must be in mourning . Had they been merely consoling the widow of a peer ? No , it could not be . It was merely a chance resemblance , some trick of the light , a similarity in bearing -- -Then he saw the locket gleaming in the hollow of her throat . He knew that locket well , for he 'd ordered the jeweler to make it just so , with the design of the golden serpent 's coils cradling an emerald . Ah , so it was true . When there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it as possible . His eyes narrowed as the woman turned to reenter the grand house . Then one must consider how to turn it to one 's advantage . A new plan , a perfect new plan , blossomed in his mind . He would take her back with him -- -but he must take care that she went more or less willingly . He could merely steal her away , but how to control her ? He was a bit short of treasonous minions at the moment , nor did he have the gold to bribe the mercenary sorts . On the other hand , she obviously possessed a plenty from her generous , elderly husband . He almost smiled , for he did appreciate such ruthless ambition . She could afford two passages on a fine , if highly illegal , ship . If he could convince her to come away voluntarily , at least until he could imprison her aboard a ship and keep her drugged for the journey to Paris , then his long arduous penance might come to a close at last . He could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for although he could promise much , who would leave such luxury unless they were forced to ? Then again , if the burden of playing lady of the manor became too much -- -He would begin immediately , then , to make sure she would have no reason to stay . Julia stayed where she was for a long moment as the four men on horseback rounded the turn in the long drive . In moments , they were gone . She 'd not been surprised when they 'd refused the hospitality of Barrowby . They must have realized that every word they 'd uttered would have been reported by her faithful staff . Three large men , one slight . All handsome in different ways . All waxing territorial , their hackles raised . She 'd not been around that much heady virility in a very long time . It would be enough to make a sillier woman giddy . Luckily , she simply was n't that sort . Continues ... by Bradley , Celeste                 @ @ @ @
