Massinello Pietro <p> He fed the canaries and the geese and the dogs and the cats . Then he cranked up the rusty phonograph and sang to the hissing " Tales from the Vienna Woods " : <p> <p> Life goes up , life goes down , <br> But please smile , do not sigh , do not frown ! <p> <p> Dancing , he heard the car stop before his little shop . He saw the man in the gray hat glance up and down the storefront and knew the man was reading the sign which in large , uneven blue letters declared the manager . Everything free ! Love and charity for all ! <p> The man stepped halfway through the open door and stopped . " Mr. Massinello Pietro ? " <p> Pietro nodded vigorously , smiling . " Come in . Do you want to arrest me ? Do you want to throw me in jail ? " <p> The man read from his notes . " Better known as Alfred Flonn ? " He eyed the silver bells on Pietro 's shirtsleeves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed . <p> The man was uncomfortable . He looked around a room crammed full of rustling birdcages and packing crates . Geese rushed in through the back door , stared at him angrily , and rushed back out . Four parrots blinked lazily on their high perches . Two Indian lovebirds cooed softly . Three dachshunds capered around Pietro 's feet , waiting for him to put down just one hand to pet them . On one shoulder he carried a banana-beaked mynah bird , on the other a zebra finch . <p> " Sit down ! " sang Pietro . " I was just having a little music ; that 's the way to start the day ! " He cranked the portable phonograph swiftly and reset the needle . <p> " I know , I know . " The man laughed , trying to be tolerant . " My name 's Tiffany , from the D.A . ' s office . We got a lot of complaints . " He waved around the cluttered shop . " Public health . All these ducks , raccoons , white mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean it up . " <p> " Six people have told me that . " Pietro counted them proudly on his fingers . " Two judges , three policemen , and the district attorney himself ! " <p> " You were warned a month ago you had thirty days to stop this nuisance or go to jail , " said Tiffany , over the music . " We 've been patient . " <p> " I , " said Pietro , " have been the patient one . I have waited for the world to stop being silly . I have waited for it to stop wars . I have waited for politicians to be honest . I have waited  --  la la la  --  for real estate men to be good citizens . But while I wait , I dance ! " He demonstrated . <p> " But look at this place ! " protested Tiffany . <p> " Is n't it wonderful ? Do you see my shrine for the Virgin Mary ? " Pietro pointed . " And here , on the wall , a framed letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've done for the poor ! Once , I was rich , I had property , a hotel . A man took it all away , my wife with it , oh , twenty years ago . Do you know what I did ? I invested what little I had left in dogs , geese , mice , parrots , who do not change their minds , who are always friends forever and forever . I bought my phonograph , which never is sad , which never stops singing ! " <p> " That 's another thing , " said Tiffany , wincing . " The neighborhood says at four in the morning , um , you and the phonograph . . . " <p> " Music is better than soap and water ! " <p> Tiffany shut his eyes and recited the speech he knew so well . " If you do n't have these rabbits , the monkey , the parakeets , everything , out by sundown , it 's the Black Maria for you . " <p> Mr. Pietro nodded with each word , smiling , alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man ? Have I kicked a child ? Have I stolen a watch ? Have I foreclosed a mortgage ? Have I bombed a city ? Have I fired a gun ? Have I told a lie ? Have I cheated a customer ? Have I turned from the Good Lord ? Have I taken a bribe ? Have I peddled dope ? Do I sell innocent women ? " <p> " No , of course not . " <p> " Tell me , then , what have I done ? Point to it , lay a hand on it . My dogs , these are evil , eh ? These birds , their song is dreadful , eh ? My phonograph  --  I suppose that 's bad , too , eh ? All right , put me in jail , throw away the key . You will not separate us . " <p> The music rose to a great crescendo . He sang along with it : <p> <p> Tiffa-nee ! Hear my plea ! <br> Ca n't you smile ; sit awhile , be my friend ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiffany drove away in his car . <p> Pietro felt a pain in his chest . Still grinning , he stopped dancing . The geese rushed in and pecked gently at his shoes as he stood , bent down , holding his chest . <p> At lunchtime , Pietro opened a quart of homemade Hungarian goulash and refreshed himself . He paused and touched his chest , but the familiar pain had vanished . Finishing his meal , he went to gaze over the high wooden fence in the backyard . <p> There she was ! There was Mrs. Gutierrez , very fat , and as loud as a jukebox , talking to her neighbors on the other side of the lot . <p> " Lovely lady ! " called Mr. Massinello Pietro . " Tonight I go to jail ! Your war is fought and won . I give you my saber , my heart , my soul ! " <p> Mrs. Gutierrez came ponderously across the dirt yard . " What ? " she said , as if she could n't see or hear him . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I laughed ! " His hand flirted on the air , two fingers wiggling . " I hope you will be happy ! " <p> " I did n't call no police ! " she said indignantly . <p> " Ah , Mrs. Gutierrez , I will write a song for you ! " <p> " All of them other people must 've called in , " she insisted . <p> " And when I leave today for jail , I 'll have a present for you . " He bowed . <p> " I tell you it was n't me ! " she cried . " You and your mealy mouth ! " <p> " I compliment you , " he said sincerely . " You are a civic-minded citizen . All filth , all noise , all odd things must go . " <p> " You , you ! " she shouted . " Oh , you ! " She had no more words . <p> " I dance for you ! " he sang , and waltzed into the house . <p> <br> Continues ...    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
