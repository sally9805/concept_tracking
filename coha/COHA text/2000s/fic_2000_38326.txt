Has it really been a dozen years since jack Dann 's last appearance here ? It seems that " Sentry , " one of the stories he wrote with jack C. Haldeman II that ultimately went into the novel High Steel , marked his last publication in these pages way back in 1988 . Of course , most of you readers will have seen his name elsewhere , probably on one of his more recent novels such as The Silent and The Memory Cathedral ( and maybe you 've been lucky enough to get a copy of his latest , Bad Medicine , which has only been published on his home turf of Australia ) . Or perhaps you 've seen the award-winning anthology he coedited with his wife Janeen Webb , Dreaming Down-Under . But here he is again , and we 're happy to report that in addition to this iconic fantasia , we 've got more stories coming from him in the future . ( Incidentally , if you 'd like to hear John Heard perform an adaptation of this story , look up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOURTEEN , AND SHE was stone white and naked and blond . She was hazed in the pale cold light pouring in from the frost-shrouded windows of my bedroom , and I remember the dustmotes floating in the mid-afternoon sunshine , I remember the luminous living clouds of dust swirling around her great diaphanous wings , which seemed to shudder as she stepped toward the bed ... my bed . Those wings were white as tissue and seemed as fragile , as if they would break or crack or tear with the merest motion or gust of wind , and I remember her green-flecked eyes staring at me as she moved across my bedroom , which was filled with books and magazines and forty-five rpm records and pre-cut balsa models of World War II fighter planes including a British Supermarine Spitfire MK XII that would be fitted with radio controls in various stages of completion , and I could n't help myself , I looked at her breasts and at her naturally dark mat of pubic hair , and I was so terrified that I closed my eyes . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than forty years ago . It was the year that Buddy Holly , the Big Bopper , and Richie Valens were killed in a plane crash in Iowa . Alaska became the 49th State , which brought Texas down a peg , and Hawaii became the 50th . Rio Bravo and Ben Hur came out that year ; Navy beat Army 43-12 , and Mafia boss Joseph Barbara and forty of his " delegates " got busted at his house in Appalachin , which was about fifteen miles away from my home town in upstate New York . I found the old book after my father died in 1987 . I was searching through the bedroom closet that he had always locked , and I was lost in the smells of cedar and old clothes - there were old leather key rings and wallets , a lifetime member Playboy card , a stiletto knife that he had taken away from me when I was sixteen , a taped envelope that contained an old black and white Polaroid photograph of a dark-haired buxom woman - certainly not my mother - wearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuxedo studs and cufflinks and silver pens and penknives , playing cards backed with photographs of nude women , white plastic collar stays of varied size , check registers , an old will in a manila envelope , letters tied with a black ribbon , expired insurance policies , a woman 's red silk handkerchief , and my paperback edition of The Fundamentals of Self-Hypnosis and Yoga : Theory , Practice , and Application , by Julian Rammurti , M. A. , M. D. Its spine was broken and pages fell out as I held it open in my palm . Dad had never told me he had taken the book . Nor had he ever told me that he had taken the stiletto . I remember how keenly I had felt the loss of the book at the time . But that was only because it was mine ... because it was the first book I 'd found on the subject ... and because it worked . I could find other books on yoga and hypnotism , which I did . I lived in libraries and learned clinical theories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flair for stage hypnotism , which was the antithesis of the careful , quiet clinical process . For an instant - standing there in my father 's closet , a grown man discovering the secrets of his youth , savoring the presence of the living past - I saw myself as if in a minor : a thin , gangly , pimply-faced boy of fourteen again , straight brown hair greased back with pomade , red buttondown shirt , collar raised , leather jacket , black pegged pants . The boy sneered into those books , indeed , as if he were looking into a mirror . A poor reflection of Elvis . Reading ... reading about posthypnotic suggestion and methods for creating the state of yoganidra . The powers of tratakam . Lucid Dreaming . The state of somnambulism . Hypermnesia . Prang and Pranayama . The story of the man and the bear . I 've often remembered that story of the man and the bear . It went something like this : There was a psychiatrist who was wounded in France during the Second World War . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew bored and occupied himself with a posthypnotic suggestion . He 'd hypnotized himself and conjured up a great bear to provide some comic relief from the day to day boredom . All he had to do was say " Bear " and count to five and miraculously , a huge white polar bear with a long , flexible neck would stroll upright into the ward , leap about in the aisles , try to mount the nurses , frolic around the other patients , or hunch against the psychiatrist 's bed and allow himself to be petted . So the bear cavorted in the mornings and afternoons , and likewise all the psychiatrist had to do was count to five and the bear would disappear . The bear had no weight , made no noise , could somersault in the air , walk on the ceiling , deftly unbutton nurses " blouses with its curved yellow claws , remove bras , and dance with any of the variously undressed doctors , nurses , patients , and visitors , who were never the wiser . The psychiatrist also conjured up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the apparition soon began to take on a different , more ominous aspect in the dark . It became more aggressive , would not always obey commands , and when it leered , a feat the psychiatrist was certain no other bear could manage , its fangs seemed much longer than they had been during the day . So the psychiatrist mumbled " Bear , " counted to five , and disappeared his ill-conceived creation . But the bear was not so easily dismissed . It appeared the next night , unbidden , and the next day it snapped at the nurses and bit the psychiatrist on the forearm . A warning . Although it left no marks , of course , the psychiatrist was in excruciating pain for hours . The psychiatrist had to hypnotize himself three times to get rid of it . Nor did that work ... entirely ; and years later , the bear would oftimes appear - a vague , threatening form in the distance - and follow the psychiatrist , who developed the disconcerting habit of always looking behind him . SO I LAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made bed and waited for Marilyn Monroe to come to me , to change me completely - change me from an awkward , pimply-faced adolescent into a fullblooded man who knew the moist secrets of women , who 'd actually and really been laid , even if through the devices and snares of an altered state of consciousness known only to hypnotists and young dabblers in the arcane such as myself . It did n't matter how I did it . What mattered was that I did it . I had floated , fallen , drifted , breathed myself into the deepest , most profound state of hypnosis . I had imagined myself rowing a boat on a calm , shallow , infinite sea ; every breath took me farther out upon the placid ocean , breathing in , breathing out , skiffing in smooth clockwork motion , each breath out , each breath in taking me farther , farther into a calm azure place without depth , without horizon ; yet I could feel everything around me : the wool of the blanket itching my neck , the cold smoothness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold chill seeping in through the windows , and I saw her in that instant as I blinked open my eyes and shut them tight again . The woman who inhabited every adolescent male 's dream . Walking toward me , a look of blond rapture an her painted fulllipped face- six shades of lipstick , I knew about that , Marilyn I love you , and I waited for her , waited in the dark bosom of my self-directed dream , waited for her to come upon me , slip beside me , touch me , guide me , sail me across the sea of my quickening breathing , sail me out of my virginity . I would lose my cherry to an apparition , a ghost , an hallucination , but at fourteen , in North Leistershire , New York , population 16,000 , in 1959 , that was the best I could hope for . With my eyes closed-I do believe they were closed , but perhaps they were not - I could feel her walking toward me , past the built-in , beige  --  painted bookshelves that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always kept in my room , past the door that connected to my parents " bedroom ... walking under all the mobiles and models that floated just below the ceiling and defied gravity by mere threads ; and then she was standing over me , standing beside the bed , standing beside my slippers and sneakers and cordovan dress shoes , and I knew that she was leaning , leaning over me now -I could hear her shallow , patient breathing and the rustling whispering of her wings , smell her overly sweet perfume mixed with a more acrid , damp odor- and all I would have to do was take her in my arms , she would fall into my arms like pillows and soft toys and cushions ; and all I had to do was open my eyes to see her breasts and I could raise my hands to touch them . All I had to do was open my eyes . I tried . I had to see her . I had memorized her from a hundred photographs : the mole above her swelled lips , the eyelashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earrings dangling , everything about her swollen and curved and fleshy and full of promises But in that instant , in that terrible instant of realization or proffered possibility , I felt everything change . I know it was my own fault , my own perverse nature , but somehow I suddenly changed the rules . Much as I desired to bring Marilyn 's warm body close to my own , to enter her and lose everything I hated and instantly gain my manhood , I imagined something else instead . In that terrifying , transforming instant I imagined that whatever I was most afraid of now stood in Marilyn 's place , and I dared not open my eyes for fear of what I would see , yet I was afraid to keep them closed because it was unbearable not to see what was looming over me , suffocating me , watching me ; and I remember the slow-motion tossing and turning and shaking , as the sea I had drifted too far upon began to rage and rise ; and , in fact , I was caught between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convulsion lasted , but once I awakened to the world of slanting sunlight and the familiar smell of bedsheets and air-freshener , I vowed never to hypnotize myself again . After that Marilyn never came to me in my dreams , but the dark thing that I had conjured in her place shadowed me . Like the psychiatrist who kept looking over his shoulder to check whether his great white bear was tailing him , so did I feel the presence of my apparition . But unlike the psychiatrist , who at least knew his enemy , I could only sense this manifestation of my fears . In my teens I thought of it as a monster shaped something like a bear , and I imagined its claws tapping on macadam or sidewalks , and I would turn quickly , just to check , and , of course , there would never be anything there , at least not anything untoward . Over the years , I gave up on monsters , for they , too , ceased to inhabit my dreams . My dreams had one recurrent element , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would all , at one stage or another , take on the color of deep purple , yet the color would be more like damp mist , which felt thick and ominous and signaled danger , but the mist was the stuff of the world in my dreams , and it would bleed out of the sky and buildings and people - just as it would bleed out of myself - dying my monochrome dreams with purple fear and anxiety and uncertainty . But I was n't the beast entirely . Only part of it . The dreams coalesced into reality one numbingly cold dark morning in Vietnam . It was January 1969 . We 'd been stuffed into a deuce-and-a-half , one of three trucks going out of Phu Bai down south where the fighting was supposed to be heating up . Everybody was shivering , and I remember sitting perfectly still because it was warmer that way , and Joey Mantaneo was pushed against me like four o'clock on the D-train going to Brooklyn , and even in the cold he smelled like cordite and rot and piss hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crawling toward me ) , and he had his war name SCARED SHITLESS painted across his flack jacket and stenciled on his helmet like he was military police , and I knew the story about how he got his name - but he was the only one in Bravo who 'd never been wounded or sick , not even an infection when he cut his finger . He claimed he was a street fighter and his gang was called " The Road Gents , " even though nobody in the gang had a car , and he said he knew as much about killing before he came out here as he did after , but he always looked scared - he just had that kind of a face - and when he was green somebody said he was scared shitless and so he took that name for himself . The guy who named him was dead , but SCARED SHITLESS was n't . Neither was BURNT COP and CALL ME WHITE , and they 'd been brought up in a black bopping gang in Philadelphia called " The Flicks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guys were farmers or factory workers or mechanics -I was the only college boy , and they called me " Professor " - and they named themselves BORN TO DIE , BORN TO KILL , KILL OR BE KILLED , KILLER ANGEL , and if you believed everybody , every one of them was a stoned killer street fighter and a drug-dealer and a hustler and a pussy-magnet , but we were all just kids . Full of piss and vinegar eight months ago , but now exhausted and sick with the shits and fungus and getting bald and everything else . And while the goddamn truck rocked and jittered in the muddy craters that was supposed to be the convoy route-I was black and blue from being thrown around in that can - everybody was singing and whistling " Reach Out , I 'll Be There , " and then " Mellow Yellow , " and Cop and Manteneo and Sammy Chitester were singing in falsetto , so it sounded like we had women in the chorus , and then everybody did Otis Redding 's " Sittin " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good . We sounded like a rock band without microphones coming through the storm that had kept up for days , and it seemed like the world was going to stay dark and moonlit forever ; and everything was covered with leaves that blew all over like home in October , but nothing else was like home : the houses along the way that were still standing were burned and pitted from shells , and there were refugees who looked like they ought to be dead and buried walking along the road ; some were wounded , and although the old people did n't seem to pay any attention to us , the rest looked at us like we were the enemy ; they hated us , even though they were too afraid to say word one ; and we just crashed and bounced and sang and whistled through the dark , through the rain and fog , and you would have thought you were at the south pole or something where it was twilight all the time , and then we blew out our transmission , and although a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rest of us marched . We went twenty clicks before we finally bivouacked in a deserted village that was n't far from the Citadel of Hue . It was cold and wet and dark and I could n't stop shivering . Viet Cong could have been ali around us , for all we could tell , even though we 'd caught up with our trucks and guards were posted and the place was secured , but I did n't care about anything . None of us who 'd done the marching copped guard duty , and I would have fallen asleep if I had ; it was as if someone had pushed a button and all the life just went out of me . I could n't even eat or relieve myself . I just wrapped myself up in my poncho liner and fell asleep in an empty hooch . There were bits of glass all over the floor that would sometimes catch the light like little green and yellow and orange and blue gems , the kind sold in the hobby stores along with crystals and beads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dream about jewels and beads and velvet and cold empty darkness . I did n't dream at all . But dreams or no dreams , we were up before first light ; and our orders were to go the rest of the way , wherever that was going to be , on foot because they needed the trucks up north ( where it was safe ) , and so we watched the deuces drive off and then we walked to paradise . That 's what it looked like , anyway , and before we realized what was happening , most of us were dead . Only Joey Mantaneo and I survived , and Joey , of course , did n't even get a scratch , but he suffered later , went half-crazy with recurring nightmares ; at least that was what I heard , only I ca n't to this day remember who I heard that from . I did n't suffer any nightmares ... after that I could n't remember my dreams . We were approaching the south bank of the Perfume River , and there were the smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern sector of Hue ; and spread out before us was lush grass and fog swirling like we were walking on a carpet through clouds - the grass was deep green from all the rain , but there was a metal smell to the air ; and although that mist did n't look purple , like in my childhood dreams , I sensed that this place was wrong , that it was hazy and purple and that the purple was about to bleed out from the sky and me and everyone else , but I just could n't quite see it yet . For all that I just said , this place was picture-perfect : a lone sampan on the river , an old man riding a bicycle up the avenue that ran along the park , for we were walking through a park . I remember breathing in and looking around , and then I saw a flash and heard an explosion , and Mantaneo screamed " Motherfuckers ! " or maybe that was me , but it did n't matter because there was another explosion and I realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the sky and watching watching watching for the purple , watching waiting for the change , please God make this just a dream , and I heard a gurgling noise and a wheezing noise , and I remembered the training film I 'd seen on sucking chest wounds , and I just figured my chest had been blown out and I was dying , but I did n't think " Oh my God I 'm dying " or " Mamma . " Everything was still and cold and quiet as a winter morning , and Marilyn came to me , just like she did the first time . I could smell her damp perfume and then I could feel her coming toward me and studying me like she was a doctor and I was a patient , and then she lay down on top of me , straddling me ; her pale face pressed against my neck , her stiff blond hair tickling my chin and lips ; and I could feel her body moving against mine , and her wings , feathered white , layers and layers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt myself inside her , felt the cold ether wetness , felt myself being drawn into her , into down , into feathers , into the swirling mists of cloud , drawn into a silent , cold heaven . mANTANEO SAVED my ass that day by pulling me into one of the VC 's tunnels , and we hid in a dark , damp , earthy room . By all rights , we should have met up with its owner ; but , as I said earlier , Mantaneo always had the right luck and never got hurt . The way I heard it later , he just waited until the VC left and somehow managed to keep me alive . I never saw him again to thank him . And , of course , I do n't remember what happened . After I came back to the World , as we called coming home in those days , I waited for Marilyn . I liked to think that she came to me every night in my dreams . But since I could n't remember dreaming , it was moot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out and regained my health , I 'd remember my dreams again . The shrink , of course , attributed everything to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder , which had become the fashionable diagnosis for everything that had happened to every grunt in " Nam . I argued that I did n't exhibit any of the other symptoms of PTSD : diminished interest in activities , feelings of detachment from others , exaggerated startle responses , sleep disturbances , survivor guilt , memory impairment , recurrent dreams of a traumatic event , or trouble concentrating . I 'd put myself through law school - memorized the Uniform Commercial Code and fifty cases a night , and I wo n't believe you can do that without concentration and a good memory . But he was not to be dissuaded . He figured that I was having nightly traumas ; I just could n't remember them . I could n't argue that kind of logic , so I stopped seeing him . Eventually , of course , I started dreaming again , and I was , indeed , having recurrent dreams , but whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you because all I could remember was that they were about wings - gauzy , translucent wings that sometimes looked like feathers , sometimes like down , and sometimes like the surface of a soap bubble . I suppose I became obsessed by the very idea , obsessed with flying frogs and flying dragons and flying fish , with horseshoe bats and redwings and griffon vultures and hummingbirds , with hawk moths and wasps and hovel flies ... and with those who like me could n't fly . I spent hours at the botanical gardens watching the swans and remembering Marilyn 's wings fanning and spreading ; and I wondered , I tried to remember : were they white and feathery or were they gossamer rainbows settling around me like silken sheets , billowing , as alive as the surface of the sea ? I usually remembered them as white and feathery . The wings of angels . I started dating blond women-how I yearned for pale skin and white  --  bleached hair-and then I married a petite , dark-haired woman , may she rest in peace , and we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights she knew I was n't with her . I would dream pretend that she was someone else , and then for an instant the sheets would become wings . Josiane died of ovarian cancer under cool white sheets . I had always thought that the next time - if there were ever to be a next time - I would find myself looking at the monster that was unseen but terrifyingly present when I 'd first conjured Marilyn out of an old book about hypnosis . Every night I lived with the anticipation , with the desire and the fear - waiting for Marilyn , or the monster , Marilyn , monster ; and my bones grew , my hormones changed , as did the color of my hair- from blond to brown to gray , as the years passed me through Binghamton Central High School , Broome Community College , Vietnam with its smells of cordite and damp familiar colors of fear , Hofstra University in Hempstead , Long Island , where I drove a Buick Le Sabre and wore tie-dyed T-shirts , Brooklyn Law School , clerking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to junior to senior partner , from Brooklyn to Brooklyn Heights to Manhattan to Connecticut ; marriage , children , vacations , fourteen-hour days , weekends on Fire Island , divorce , reconciliation , death , ) Josiane 's dead , say it , admit it , there , fact , and through it all , through all the empty and disconnected nights , all that was left were desire and fear . My whole life a moment wrapped around anticipations of dreams ... or nightmares . Marilyn or the monster . I did finally find them . I 'd received an invitation from my old unit to attend a reunion . It had been thirty years . I looked for Joey Mantaneo in the columns of names and addresses between the grainy photographs , but he was n't mentioned . I was listed alphabetically , home address , home phone , business phone , just like all the other officers and noncoms and grunts . There I was , a ghost in black letter type , but Joey had disappeared . That night I dreamed about him . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to follow him , skipping around time like it was an old neighborhood , and I found him in Bayonne , New Jersey , where he was working as an electrician for the building firm of Calley &; La Cross , or so I dreamed ; and Joey 's wife was named Louise , and he had three daughters , Marsha , Missie , and Maeve , and in that dream I 'd forgotten the names of my own daughters , but did n't follow that trail , lest I dwell upon how I 'd failed my children and my wife , and how I - but that was n't important ; I was following Joey . I 'd always be safe with Joey because he was a survivor ; he survived , survived the bopping gangs and the drugs and everything else and I would n't let myself drift back into Vietnam , but Joey led me right back . He took me through his father 's candy store and showed me how he 'd grown up . He took me to Larry 's Bar , which was across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we sat at the bar , which had a brass rail to rest your feet on , and we drank boilermakers , dropping the shot-glasses filled with Johnny Red right into the beer mugs - all the regulars had their own personal mug at Larry 's . We drank three shots and beers , and I felt an overwhelming sadness as I looked at Joey , an overwhelming longing . He had lost most of his hair , had put on weight , which changed the shape of his face - took out the definition and sharp , clean good looks and replaced them with a softness that was somehow repellent ; and Joey smelled bad ; he was dressed in jeans and a faded shirt , and he leaned over and told me that he was still in Hue , still in Vietnam - that we were still in Hue - and that 's when the dream broke apart . It had been so real , as not to be a dream , although I knew that bits and pieces were wrong , that there was no company called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , but Joey leaned toward me , then grabbed me by the shoulders and We tumbled into the VC 's tunnel , back into that cold , damp morning near the Perfume River , and I was lying against the dirt wall , sitting up , while Joey pressed his hand against my chest and said , " Jesus Christ , Jesus Christ , " and there were a few rays of light coming in from the entrance above , and they were golden and seemed as solid as the blades of ancient bronze swords , and I watched the dust swirling through them , swirling swirling and I remembered my room in Leistershire , remembered lying on the bed and counting myself into a hypnotic trance , into a deep state of somnambulism , and I was fourteen and about to conjure up Marilyn out of my adolescent desires and the light pouring in through my windows , light filled with dustmotes dancing swirling , promise , everything filled with promise and Then Joey stopped fussing with me , and we could hear someone scraping around above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant surrender , but we could tell it was our own boys ; we were all taught Chew hoi , Yuh tie len , Iie day-surrender , come out with your hands up , and then concussion , blinding light , the cracking of thunder , and then silence as my ears popped , and I felt sudden wetness all over me , sonovabitch whoever was up there could n't wait to take prisoners , or find out who the hell we were , and I wiped my face , everything smeared with blood , Joey , Joey was all over me . I looked around , light now pouring in from the entrance that was forward and above , pouring in like mist , which swirled , turning everything to blood , and I was holding Joey 's torso , but his arms and legs and head had been blown off , and I was a liar , he was n't lucky , or maybe he was . I closed my eyes , but the blood and light and mist could not be closed out ; rather everything slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shaking in slow motion , and I remembered having convulsions before , but now it did n't matter if I closed my eyes or opened them , I 'd found the monster-Joey , Joey , goddamn it , and I screamed and opened my eyes and the mist the fog cleared and I could see her , standing in the entrance that was flooded with light , pure blazing sunlight , cold winter morning light . She was moonlight white , and naked , and her eyes were drawn in black and her lips were smeared with blood and as she reached toward me , coaxing me out of the earth , her wings spread out reflexively ; they were butterfly blue fans , deep azure , darkening , darkening into purple black , and they quivered , trembling to the meter of her perfectly measured pulse , and I remember I remember I whispered " Mamma " Just like every other grunt who thought he was about to die . <p>                   @ @
