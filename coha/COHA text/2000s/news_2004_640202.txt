<p> New suburban blight <p> A time traveler left his new , multicolored , unique Victorian home and decided to visit Colorado in 2004 . He was so confused . When he went to the paint store , all he could buy were four colors of paint : dark brown , light brown , dark gray and light gray . Then he went to the drug store , where he found more than 100 types of sunscreen . He asked someone to explain it to him . The embarrassed Coloradan simply said , ' It is illegal to paint your homes any color but these four . Plus , the developers took down all the trees . So we need a lot of sunscreen . ' <p> Developers , is this truly the legacy you want to pass to our children and grandchildren ? <p> SHAWN BOMAN <p> Denver <p> Dean unfairly attacked <p> I am confused by all the uproar caused by Howard Dean 's enthusiastic speech in Iowa last week . One would have thought Dean had admitted to having an affair or being a drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech and gave out a little yell at the end . So what ? The TV pundits are talking like it will end his campaign for president . I am not even a Dean supporter , although I think any Democrat is better than Bush , but this is surreal , as is so much in our current political scene . My guess is that some people who have a lot of power , and who own a lot of media outlets , feel threatened by Dean . Why , I do n't know , but perhaps because of his ability to raise a lot of funds at a grassroots level and his opposition to the war in Iraq . <p> Whether he wins the nomination or not , I applaud him for helping push the other Democratic candidates to the left . It 's nice to hear Democrats sound like Democrats again . <p> EVAN EISENTRAGER <p> Boulder <p> Define ' unpresidential ' <p> If expressing emotion during a pep rally is ' unpresidential , ' yet waging an offensive war of naked aggression in violation of international law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president any day . ' Dr. Dean goes to Washington ' may never make it to the theaters , but the good doctor , Howard Dean , has done the entire country a great service by breathing new life into our democracy . We also have the eminently reasonable Dean to thank for demonstrating to the rest of the world that not all Americans are anti-scientific and bellicose fanatics . <p> LAURIE CALHOUN <p> Boulder <p>  --  Column insulted Lincoln High players , coaches <p> Re : ' Volatile rematch a necessity , ' Jan. 22 Mark Kiszla sports column . <p> Mark Kiszla 's column was extremely insulting to Abraham Lincoln High School and its players and coaches . References to ' the machismo ' flowing from the crowd , ' gang signs ' and ' street justice ' promote an idea that our school is comprised of a bunch of thugs . Insinuating that our coaches do not have control of their team and that they do not discipline their players is ludicrous . Coach Vince Valdez has molded several state-contending teams over the past five years . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . <p> Kiszla 's idea that the two teams be put in a ' cage encased in a chain-link fence ' somewhere on Federal Boulevard , with no spectators , suggests that he equates our boys to animals . I am appalled that he would refer to children in that way . <p> Yes , the game got out of control , but who is supposed to control it ? Johnny Gonzales was pummeled three times , received at least two bloody noses , and not one of three officials ever saw anything ? And another player received a ' mild concussion ' without much in the way of a call . Is it not the job of the officials to control these things ? Ultimately , our coaches and Denver Public Schools administrators were the ones to finally take control . <p> I know that altercations occur in many other schools between rivals . This is n't unique to DPS . <p> TERRY VLASIN <p> Student Activities Director <p> Abraham Lincoln High School <p> Denver <p>  --  Do n't try to legislate ' discreet ' breast-feeding <p> Re : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 23 news brief . <p> Whenever there 's public breast-feeding , two things are likely : One is that someone will complain . The other is that the word ' discreet ' will come up . <p> If state Sen. Steve Johnson is glad that women feed discreetly , he is simply telling women how to do their job . That is not acceptable . <p> Babies fuss , lift shirts and look away to see what 's doing . Mothers may not have three hands or a blanket . Breasts and nipples get exposed . In 2004 , why is that such a horror ? <p> Colorado should not try to legislate ' discreet ' feeding . That 's up to the mother : not men , not other women , not the state . <p> If women are required to cover their nipples while breastfeeding , then the government affirms that women 's chests are indecent while men 's are n't . New York and other states have shown that that is an antiquated notion based on prejudicial stereotypes . It maintains men 's power over women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak <p> Re : ' Janklow gets 100 days in jail ; Ex-S . Dakota congressman fined $ 5,750 for manslaughter in traffic death , ' Jan. 23 news story . <p> What is a motorcyclist 's life worth ? One hundred days in jail is what Randy Scott 's killer got . Bill Janklow , former governor and congressman from South Dakota , will get of jail after just 30 days - for up to 10 hours each day to do his community service . I thought you did your jail time first and then your community service . Guess not . <p> If this motorcyclist had killed Janklow , by speeding and running a stop sign , he would have gotten the maximum sentence . If you are higher up on the food chain and politically connected , the law works better for you . Janklow should lose his driver 's license for life , not three years while on probation . <p> GARY L. WARN <p> Lamar <p>  --  Final version of dog-bite bill was more neutral <p> Re : ' Dog control bill needs work , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that The Post 's editorial , concerning my bill to do away with Colorado 's ' One Bite for Free ' law , referred to the bill as it was introduced , rather than the bill it became . Even though 30 other states have ' strict liability ' laws concerning first-bite offenses , after listening to district attorneys and countless dog owners , I too became concerned that the original bill might be , as The Post stated , ' too broadly written and too draconian . ' <p> I amended the bill to remove all reference to criminal liability . I added wording to address concerns of ranchers and farmers . And I addressed dog owners ' concerns regarding provocation of a dog and trespassers onto private property . Each of these amendments was passed by the committee , and the version of the bill that was finally voted on did exactly as your editorial suggested . It created mechanisms that ' hold a dog owner accountable for a first attack , including medical and other expenses incurred by the victim . ' <p> This is an important and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheated out of compensation by an unfair law . I definitely agree that ' lawmakers of both parties should seek common ground and craft a law that is more neutrally focused but addresses the problem in a more even-handed way . ' That 's what the final version of my bill did . <p> My Republican colleagues are welcome to the bill , and they can even have credit for its passage . But please , let 's just get this done for the sake of the many victims who currently have no legal recourse . <p> State Rep.

There is even room for 200 tents on the property . Put aside politics and show compassion to the people who ca n't take care of themselves in your city . <p> LAURA DORNBRACK <p> Colorado Springs
