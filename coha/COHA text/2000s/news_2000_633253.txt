<p> ' Knock Me a Kiss ' <p> Through Feb. 27 <p> Victory Gardens Theater , 2257 N. <p> Lincoln <p> Tickets , $ 25-$ 30 <p> ( 773 ) 871-3000 <p> Charles Smith discovered the seed of his exceptional new play , " Knock Me a Kiss , " while researching an earlier work , " The Black Star Line . " <p> He was reading the autobiography of W.E.B . DuBois , the black sociologist and activist who was one of the founding forces behind the NAACP . " I kept coming across references to a woman who seemed to be named ' Wife , ' " Smith recalled . <p> It was that detached , almost utilitarian form of address for the woman who was , in fact , DuBois ' " wife , " Nina , that inspired Smith to delve more deeply . <p> " There were other things I found odd , too , " Smith said . " For example , the autobiography was almost over by the time I realized DuBois had a daughter . And it was only much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died as a very young child . " <p> Yet another bit of crucial information came to light when Smith was casually talking to Tazewell Thompson , director of the Goodman Theatre production of " Black Star Line . " Thompson mentioned that DuBois ' daughter Yolande had been married to the poet Countee Cullen , a star of the Harlem Renaissance era . <p> " I looked at Tazewell and said , ' Was n't Countee Cullen gay ? ' and he just smiled . That 's when I began to dig deeper . " <p> That digging involved going back to the archives and to the massive collection of letters DuBois left behind . The originals are at Amherst College in Massachusetts , but there is a microfilm copy of all the papers at Northwestern University  --  85 rolls of film with about 1,200 documents on each . And Smith homed in on the years 1926-30 , covering the time around Yolande 's marriage . <p> " I was shocked to read DuBois ' views on sex and his explanation of what he believed was his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I found letters he wrote to Countee Cullen after the marriage to Yolande erupted , in which he repeatedly said things like , ' You must protect your brain ; too much sex is not good . ' <p> " And then I saw Yolande 's letters to her father in which she explains everything that happened on their honeymoon in Paris , and how she discovered her husband 's preference for men . She also talks about how she asked for a divorce and how she wanted forgiveness from her father . But even after she tells her father what the situation is , he still blames her for the failure of the marriage and the destruction of his own social vision , which involved the matching up of the best of the race . " <p> Smith admits that he is fascinated by such apparently " deformed leaders . " In " Black Star Line , " his subject was Marcus Garvey , the pioneering black separatist whose megalomania led to a tragic downfall . <p> " This is an idea that has interested me for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of racial pride , " the playwright said . " I consider myself to be in the forefront of that concept , yet I 'm continually aware of how some leaders start out with a solid , admirable goal and then end up going after it by any means necessary . They are willing to sacrifice everything and anything . I think there is something wrong with that . Yet you see it at work every day  --  people who start out with admirable goals and then go astray , to the point where horrific things happen . " <p> Although documentary evidence supplied the spine of " Knock Me a Kiss , " the play is ultimately a work of speculation and imagination . And Smith , who is well aware of the controversy that can buzz around such a mix , says he has no problem with the embroidering of history . <p> " I 've thought long and hard about this issue , and I think I 've arrived at a healthy conclusion , " he said . " In some ways this play is probably more historically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which always contains an element of the writer 's fantasy . Many of the historians I 've read on DuBois and that period had agendas of their own , including some , in the 1950s and ' 60s , who wanted to refute Cullen 's homosexuality because they needed to make ideal black role models . <p> " On top of this , if you 're talking about history , well , my childhood history textbooks were n't exactly models of accuracy . So I 've fully reconciled myself to this blend of fact and imagination . " <p> Ask Smith why his plays tend to focus on issues of race and to look at blacks in historical contexts rather than contemporary ones , and he does n't hesitate a moment in his reply . ( His previous work on the subject , commissioned and produced by the Indiana Repertory Theatre in 1998 , was " Les Trois Dumas , " about the life of the French-African novelist Alexandre Dumas . ) <p> " I think these plays are about our own time , " he said . " ' Knock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1920s , but essentially it 's about a confused young woman trying to make contact with someone , and that has no time period . <p> " I also think that especially for white audiences , the historical setting makes it more approachable . If it 's our time , they tend to come with a different point of view . The past is easier to relate to . There 's no immediate threat . It makes things more relaxed . Black audiences come at it in a different way . They may enter the theater thinking , ' Oh , we have been a glorious people for a long time , ' and they revel in the history at the beginning . But then they begin to see that there 's been a whole line of lies at work . So I guess we all end up in the same subway car in the end . " <p> Smith has always straddled the two worlds anyway . The child of a black father and a white mother , he says he has been " faced with the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up on the South Side , on 47th Street . His father died in a car accident when Smith was 7 , and he was reared by his mother and stepfather ( also black ) , who worked as a taxi driver and security guard . <p> " Neither of them had high school diplomas , " he said . " And they were not involved in the arts . " <p> Even though he had a rough time in school  --  getting moved up a grade and then back a grade , and finally dropping out in his freshman year  --  he was always a great reader . And the habit stuck with him  --  first when he worked at a factory job , and later when he joined the Army . <p> " It was in the Army that I first came across a copy of ' The Illiad , ' and that led me to take courses in Chaucer and Shakespeare , which I was n't allowed to do until I got my GED , " Smith said . " After the Army , I enrolled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , so I took a theater course instead . My teacher , Sidney Daniels , asked me if I could act , and despite the fact that I 'd never even seen a play , let alone tried to act in one , I said , ' Sure . ' Before I knew it I was in a production of ' The Runner Stumbles , ' and I sat backstage every night and watched every scene . Until then , I thought maybe I 'd write novels , but I began to realize what a great thing it was to have a community of people to tell your story . And I thought : I can do that . I can write a play . " <p> Which is exactly what he did . Smith wrote his first play in about two days and presented it to another teacher , Ed Homewood , who would eventually put him in a car and drive him for an interview at the formidable Iowa Writers Workshop . <p> " I had no idea it was a graduate program , but somehow they let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Smith said . <p> Smith , who has been head of the Playwrights Workshop at Ohio University in Athens for the past 4 1/4 years , was recently invited to create a stage adaptation of Mark Twain 's remarkable novel about slavery , Pudd'nhead Wilson , for the Acting Company of the Juilliard School . He 's also working on a rewrite of a script for a futuristic , technotron-style feature film , " Unterstadt , " at the invitation of a German movie producer he met during his other teaching gig  --  a summer seminar in screenwriting at the Imaginary Academy of Dramatic Arts in Zagreb , Croatia . <p> And what about the play that begs to be written  --  the one about his mother ? <p> " I may not be emotionally stable enough to enter that minefield yet , " Smith confessed , laughing . " I may not be ready to take the lids off those pots yet . "
