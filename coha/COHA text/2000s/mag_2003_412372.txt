Section : THE Watercolor <p> After graduating from the Kansas City Art Institute and the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago , Buford King worked for 40 years as a sales and design director . After retiring in 1990 , King studied painting with Alex Powers , Katherine Chang Liu , Steve Quiller , and Gerald S. Brommer . His paintings have been included in exhibitions organized by the San Diego Watercolor Society , the Georgia Watercolor Society , the Northwest Watercolor Society , and the Rocky Mountain National Watermedia Society . He maintains a studio in Woodside , California . <p> Human activity is a tricky subject to use in painting , but Californian Buford King has managed it quite effectively for more than a dozen years . He maintains just the right balance between the illusion of reality those figures create and the abstract quality of paint on paper . His fascination with paint and his educated sense of design helps each picture become a complete experience . <p> The risk of making paintings out of performing musicians , lounging swimmers , crowded diners , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pictures can easily become illustrational stories about the activities . Viewers will have a natural tendency to focus on what the people are doing , not how they function as shapes within a painting . King understands that completely , because he worked for 40 years as a design director and devised ways of using pictures to convey a favorable message about his clients ' products . He also developed a heightened sense of composition that he applied to watermedia painting after his retirement in 1990 . <p> " I 'm a devout people-watcher , and my art depicts figures in churches , museums , cafes , and on the street , " King says . " My drawings and paintings are made quickly , with little concern for detail . I try to reflect the mood , place , and personality of the people who catch my attention while keeping things as simple as possible . " The medium King uses for that purpose can be any drawing or painting material that seems suitable . Mostly , he uses acrylics , sometimes combining the medium with transparent watercolor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either watercolors or oils , and they can be enjoyed for their unique qualities , " says King . He notes that acrylics dry quickly , can be glazed easily , that their colors are vivid , and that they can be painted on almost any surface . The artist also sometimes draws lines over the top of his paintings with Caran d'Ache water-soluble colored pencils . <p> King bases his paintings on both sketches and photographs . " Since my retirement , my wife and I have traveled a great deal , and I 've accumulated drawings and snapshots of people in a number of countries , " he comments . " When one of those has the potential to be the basis of a painting , I make several tonal studies to determine just how to handle the shapes , values , and colors . " <p> Referring to those studies , King draws the basic outline of the forms on a sheet of watercolor paper and begins laying in washes of color . " I try to be as spontaneous as possible when I 'm painting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself into a prescribed plan for the outcome . The best paintings happen when I respond to the picture as it takes shape . If one passage of shapes or colors becomes interesting , I let that guide my hand as I execute the rest of the picture . " <p> Guiding his hand became challenging for King when he suffered a stroke in January 2000 . After two months of recovery and rehabilitation , surprisingly , he was better at painting with his left hand than with his right  --  although he had been a right-handed painter until that point . " I ca n't paint details as well as I did before , " he admits , " but I 'm not sure they are all that necessary anyway . " <p> The paintings King created after his stroke may lack detail , but they still have the same intelligent balance of shapes , colors , and values . Some paintings feature strong , dark backgrounds that lend drama to the lightest forms ; others rely completely on subtle shifts between middle-range values . The coloration of figures is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh tones are made of warm oranges and pinks contrasted with cool blues and greens . In the final analysis , the most important thing is that the paintings convey the same visual interest that focused King 's attention on the subject in the first place . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page , above : Symphony , 1999 , watercolor and acrylic , 22 x 32 .
