TEN MILES FROM THE AIRPORT , trapped in summer construction , and the rental cars air-conditioning crapped out . I did n't want to double back to the Avis counter , berate the lady , and trade cars , so I forged ahead . Soon enough it was inner-city Detroit , and I was stopped at a light on a corner overrun with street people . The windows were still up despite the malfunctioning AC . Manufacturing a casual yawn I stretched both arms and locked the door with my left elbow . It was hot enough that I had damp ovals under my arms at 9:00 AM . This was supposed to be a hit-and-run affair ; I wanted out of Detroit that evening . <p> Every July evaluation period , assistant coaches pack for three weeks of travel , making predictable stops at the major tournaments . A guy can ride the bleachers in a Las Vegas , Orlando , or Chicago gym for twelve hours a day . Or longer if he can stomach it . <p> Tree had told me on the phone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Las Vegas , where it had n't rained for five months . Tree ran a rec center in Detroit , funded by the city , and helped find sponsorships for one of that city 's elite summer teams . He 'd been a great resource for years , worth more than any scouting newsletter . He never traveled in the summers , though , and had n't left Detroit in years . The kids played in his rec center constantly , and he knew them better than their high-school coaches . <p> Tree said that Jamal Davis , a youngster who was n't on the Vegas trip , would one day be better than any of the players there . I 'd never heard of Jamal Davis . Tree called him " special , " then used the words " bouncy , " " wingspan , " and " untapped . " Jamal had been hurt most of his junior year and hardly anyone had seen him . I was already tossing things into my Nike bag when Tree said the kid had size 17 feet , which is huge even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen years old and likely to grow . <p> Here was the interesting part : Jamal was n't playing with Tree 's team because he had made a commitment to be employed as a counselor at the New Beginnings Center camp for kids . That got me excited . You do n't hear words like " commitment " and " employed " when it comes to basketball recruits . No other college coach would see him play all summer . I grabbed the red-eye to Detroit . <p> Tree was civil to me largely because I paid attention to him before he got to be important . In fact , I was one of the few white coaches he 'd speak to . Tree knew everything about Detroit kids-maybe a player had relatives in the West , where I had been an assistant at State for eight years . Or say his girlfriend wanted to go to school with him . Maybe the kid did n't listen to his mother , just his grandmother . Tree would often tell me not to waste my time , but even that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at State , a man named Jack Hood . <p> At the park district board meetings Tree would flash his list of players who had gotten full rides and plead for more funding for his gym . His facility shined with new lockers and a freshly varnished floor , and all of the lights worked . Tree may have done a little double-dipping , although I could n't be sure . A sympathetic corporate head who loved hoops or a big-time dealer usually sponsored his traveling teams . <p> There would likely be no competition for Jamal to play against at this New Beginnings camp , Tree said . It was a neighborhood program for children of all ages , I guessed , with games and singing and all kinds of sports . That was fine . I figured I could see Jamal shoot around by himself at some point , which would be enough . I was already thinking ahead to signing him to a National Letter of Intent in November , before anyone saw him play a game as a senior . If he had a good year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you could n't compete with programs like theirs for an in-state kid . <p> Understand that in July a coach ca n't talk to a prospect in person , only on the phone . But as soon as I got to the camp , I 'd yank on my coaching shirt that had " State " emblazoned across the chest . I 'd hang out at the camp for an hour or so and make sure that Jamal Davis saw my State shirt . He would know that I 'd come a long way . I might even meet friends of his , or people who had some influence . I was allowed to talk to them all I wanted . <p> Jamal 's mother answered the phone when I called the house for the first time . We talked for less than five minutes , which was enough to know that she was absolutely clueless and likely would n't be a factor . Whenever a mother says , " Whatever college he wants to go to is fine with me , " cross her off . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen had moved to the big city to work in the auto plants . <p> " You 're going to be disappointed , Mr. Pentel . Jamais working . At the New Beginnings camp . In fact- " <p> " Its Pytel , " I said . " Coach Pytel . " She told me the center was down the block from where they lived . She started to say something about the camp , but it sounded like a religious pitch-I cut her off , hanging up while I was still jotting the center 's address down and crossing off her name . <p> That was how I arrived on the corner of Hubbell and something , in a section of Detroit where the main commerce appeared to be liquor and lottery tickets . When I pulled up at the New Beginnings Center there was one old lady inside behind the desk . The heat did n't seem to bother her in the least . She looked at me over the top of her glasses . I announced who I was , being sure to name State twice . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She looked at me like she was n't expecting a visitor . <p> " This is the New Beginnings Center , is n't it ? " I asked , trying to jog her memory . <p> " The New Beginnings Center camp is n't here , " she said . " The camp itself is near Freeland . " <p> OK , I thought . I 'll adjust . Freeland was probably a suburb , a safer suburb , always a relief . " Where is the camp itself ? I mean , Freeland ? " I asked , pulling a pen from my pants pocket . <p> She unfolded a huge Michigan map . Two or three hours to Freeland . Past Saginaw . So much for my quick hit in Detroit . <p> I did n't curse . This lady might come in contact with Jamal Davis ; she could be a friend of the family , or an aunt . Anyway , it was n't her fault my day just got longer . The trip was going to be a quest . I 'd make it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , make an impression on Jamal , and be checked into the Marriott by midnight . Jamal Davis would be even more impressed that I went through the trouble . <p> My thirst was giving me a headache , but I certainly was n't going to stop until I got out of Detroit . When I got on the highway , I then decided I could save valuable time by not stopping for a Gatorade , and therefore not needing to stop to piss . I 'd just hang on as best I could . <p> I rolled past the hand-painted sign that announced the New Beginnings Camp , parked next to an old yellow school bus , and pulled my dry State shirt back on . I was intercepted on my way to some noisy softball games by a graying black man with muttonchop sideburns and long , sturdy muscles . He had a whistle around his neck and a Bible next to his clipboard . He was six foot five and a half . <p> " Yes , sir , " he said . " I 'm Reverend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tone suitable for telling someone to get off your property . <p> " I 'm Steve Pytel , a college coach . " I turned square to him so he could see the lettering on my shirt . " I understand that Jamal Davis is here working , and I 've come up to see him . " This Reverend guy looked like he 'd played a little ball himself . <p> " This is n't a basketball camp , " he said . " He wo n't be playing any games here , he 's one of our counselors . " He looked angry . <p> " Jamal is very important to us . " I wiped my forehead with my sleeve . " We 've been tracking his progress for the last two years . " I explained how I could n't actually talk to Jamal in person until September 9 . <p> Reverend Oliver did n't let on that he was impressed . I asked him how long he had known Jamal . <p> " I used to play ball with his father . His pop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to look up to . " He paused to look me in the eye . In my head I heard the dinging of a slot machine . Jamais father figure . Maybe my quest was going to pay off . <p> As we neared the softball game , Reverend Oliver stopped to face me . He was a hard , serious , no-nonsense guy , probably a ferocious rebounder and defender in his day . The kind who left you bleeding but would still shake your hand . His hair rose in a moderate Afro , and probably had since the seventies . " Are you watching the flood ? " he asked , raising an eyebrow . <p> " I 'm sorry ? " I said . I did n't hear him with the bells in my head going off . Watching what flood ? <p> " I said , are you washed in the blood ' ? Have you seen the light ? " <p> " Well , yes . Sure . " Our eyes locked . He reached out to shake my hand again . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hugged me hard with his left hand . Our faces touched , and I felt the sandiness of his cheek . <p> Across the field a trumpet sounded , and I saw one kid drop his bat where he stood . The games had ended . Soon a swift stream of black children , maybe ten or twelve years old , swept by us , flowing around both sides . I held still to keep from getting stepped on . Some were gabbing about the last play of the game . As they got near Reverend Oliver they quieted , looked down , then resumed speaking once they had passed . I had my eye on an older one , a teenager , who approached from across the fields . As he got close he looked at me , then at Reverend Oliver , then back at me . I knew it was Jamal Davis , so I clasped my hands behind my back so he could get an unobstructed view of my shirt . He was closer to six foot eight , with huge hands and the longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had a face smooth and innocent . <p> " Jamal , this gentleman is a college basketball scout , " the Reverend said . " He 's come a very long way to see us . " <p> I nodded quickly , smiling , and cleared my throat . When I started to introduce myself , Reverend Oliver cut me off . " But he 's not allowed to talk to you now , " he added . The younger kids continued streaming around , between , and behind us . <p> " That 's right , " I agreed . Tm not allowed to talk to you now . NCAA rules . " <p> Jamal smiled sweetly . He looked at my shirt again , then walked off with the parade . The moment was worth a hundred recruiting letters . The day would have been productive even if I 'd headed back to Detroit that minute . <p> Reverend Oliver told me what a good kid Jamal was , and I agreed again . The kids had disappeared inside a cinder block building up the hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible study and prayer , " he said . " It 'll take a couple hours . But you 're welcome to stay around and join us for dinner in the cafeteria at six , " he said , pointing . " The evening service starts at seven-you 'd be welcome at that as well . " <p> I did n't want to drive all the way back after my short bump with Jamal , but I was n't wild about the idea of waiting for hours just to watch him eat dinner . I had to make a decision . " I 'll join you for the service at seven , " I said , " if that 's all right . " I 'd skip the cafeteria food , find something to drink . Jamal would see me at the service , where I was sure to stand out . I could use the time to return calls and check in with the office ; update our mailing list by adding the name Jamal Davis . Then check in with Tree , let him know I 'd arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shot , and then my cell phone kept telling me I was outside the customer service area . Slamming the door in disgust , I tossed the phone back in the car . <p> Three hours of unexpected dead time stared me down , a rare occurrence . I wandered around the campgrounds , keeping in the shade of the sycamores . My newspaper was lost somewhere , and I was alone with the humidity and the Michigan woods . Cheap cabin-type buildings where the children must have been staying were clumped together . There was n't a soda machine to be seen . Just picnic tables near an overgrown baseball diamond and three basketball goals set up in a dirt field where the grass had been worn away . Only one goal had a net . I gave up on my wish to watch Jamal shoot baskets . It did n't matter now-this kid looked like a player and I was going purely on instinct . At one edge of camp was a shallow river where I found a giant rock in a shady spot . With nobody in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into a pillow . <p> I had been an assistant coach for nearly ten years . There were lots of things I had to show for it , things that guys my age in other professions did n't have . Like the glamour that came with the big crowds and TV games . Of course , nobody came to see the assistant coach , but I could easily imagine the thrill of being the head man . That was where the big money was ; every assistant aspired to that position . Meantime , there was free gear , too . I had n't paid for shoes or athletic apparel in years . And I could golf for free , if I had the time or the interest . <p> A friendly breeze kept the bugs off me , and exhausted from the late-night flight , I dozed off on that rock . The angling sun woke me a couple hours later , and I was disoriented for a moment , I 'd slept that hard . My shirt was too wrinkled to smooth out . <p> Inside the cinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty across . I got there before seven , but nearly all the seats were taken . A long line of kids at the water fountain discouraged me from getting the drink I needed . Reverend Oliver escorted me by the arm to one of the middle rows . A dozen youngsters stood or slid their legs sidesaddle so I could squeeze through . For a moment the cool steel of the chair felt good on my back . Soon the remaining seats filled up . I was surrounded , like a drowning man in a sea of black . <p> A piano and an organ flanked the pulpit . An old man hunched behind the organ , and an even older man , barely alive it seemed , sat at the piano . Reverend Oliver took his place near them . The older man began a slow number , and the sound bounced off the cinder block walls and settled over us . We were jammed in so tight that I was touching arms with the boys on both sides of me , but they did n't seem to mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A minute later the choir walked to the front , decked out in purple robes . They moved with a slow confidence , as though they were the team to beat at a tournament . Jamal Davis was the last of the ten choir members . They were a bit older than the kids I was among , and I assumed they were counselors , too . Jamal was so much taller than everyone else that he stood out . Just , I 'm sure , as I did . They were humming the tune played by the piano and organ until they fell into line . Then the music stopped . Jamal noticed me-how could he not ? - and smiled at me again . I was glad I 'd stuck around . Suddenly , Reverend Oliver stepped forward to the pulpit . <p> He was angry again . <p> He began speaking in that same get-off-my-property voice he 'd used earlier . He talked about fooling other people and fooling yourself , but not fooling God . He talked about being in the world but not of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dust one day , and I could tell he meant it . " I 've never seen a hearse with a U-Haul on the back , " he said , and we all laughed . If he said something he really meant , he 'd say it twice , but louder the second time . <p> He started saying that we all had to account for what we 'd done in this world . That made me consider some more of the advantages of being a coach . The courtesy car , there was that . I could get it washed for free whenever I wanted . I 'd been to most of the fifty states for games or recruiting , although I 'd never seen the Statue of Liberty or the Grand Canyon , things that most people visit when they travel . It was usually Holiday Inns and high-school gymnasiums , but still it was free travel . And every employee at State could take one free class every semester . I had thought about that quite a bit and planned to take advantage of it soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids could sit still for the sermon and did n't seem anxious for it to end . The boys around me started to holler back at Reverend Oliver in a way that would have landed them in the principal 's office if they were in a classroom . They all agreed with him and were cheering him on . Although a lot of the kids were smiling , he still seemed angry . And when he made the point again about not fooling God , he added that none of us could deny it . He pointed at several different kids , one at a time , and shouted to each one , " You cant deny it ! " Then he pointed at me and hollered that I could n't deny it . I could n't . I do n't think there was anything he could have said that I would have denied . <p> He nodded to the old man behind the organ , who kick-started a fast , rollicking number , and the piano followed soon after . I leaned back to relax then and just enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving side to side in time to the music and were bumping into my shoulders . I had to move , too , to keep from getting jounced around . Soon we were all swaying side to side in long rhythmic shifts . <p> As the music got louder , the boys started clapping their hands on the upbeat . We were all rocking in time-the row in front of us in the opposite direction just like the row behind us-and a lot of the kids had their eyes closed and heads tilted back . I was the only one not clapping , and that felt odd , so I started clapping , too . Everyone glistened with sweat except me . <p> Reverend Oliver shouted over the music and the clapping , shouted about making sacrifices in our lives . That got me thinking about some of the things I 'd sacrificed because of coaching . Stephanie says we 'd still be together if I was n't a coach , although I might contest that statement . While coaching was n't grueling , like being in an auto plant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One time she said that I " put values on human beings , " which I 'm not so sure is true . And even if it was true , was it so unusual ? Did stockbrokers pal around with guys who declared bankruptcy ? Did real estate agents befriend the homeless ? <p> The choir started a call and response thing , where they sang a phrase and we sang back . The singers started with something like , " Are you going to be ready to go ? " and we 'd sing back a resounding , " God 's gon na ease my troubling mind . " That was how we answered every one of the choirs challenges . <p> Then a couple of kids jumped up-soon everybody did-and I do n't know why , but I did , too , riding on the wave of the music , I guess , and the clapping and singing and organ and piano kept building and getting louder , and then the organ player stood up as well , but kept pumping out the song , sort of hunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all still clapping , swaying back and forth and back , when a strange lightness swept into me . The heat was tumbling toward us from the front of the building , and I felt that warmth in my face and finally began perspiring , too , but it only made me warmer . <p> What stung me worst about the breakup of my marriage was when Stephanie said that I had no identity without my job . " If you peeled away the coaching , " she asked , " what would be left ? " Of course , that was during a wildly emotional moment . As the organ music continued , my mind floated up to the 6o-watt bulbs suspended from the ceiling . And I thought , there 's a purity here , something real and authentic . There was no TV revenue at stake , or boosters donations , or rollover contracts . Reverend Oliver raised both fists in the air as though he 'd sunk a game-winning shot . Every choir member was soaked with perspiration . I think Jamal and some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was sweat and what were tears . It embarrassed me to realize it , but these people , these kids , mostly , had something in their lives , something simple , that I did n't have . I did n't know whether I wanted exactly what it was they had . But I knew this : I did n't want what I had anymore . <p> The next thing I remember was crumpling . I banged the back of my head on the steel chair , and everything went dark for a minute . A bunch of hands on my back woke me . Kids carried me out of the building , my face to the ceiling , holding me above their heads . The music kept going without missing a beat , and the choir changed their part to something about the spirit hitting you , and the kids continued to answer back . Even the ones carrying me . <p> They set me down next to the river . I must have slipped in and out of consciousness , because I remember being carried out but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head hurt , but in a good way , like I 'd been through a rough pickup game . I was flat on my back . One of the kids dipped his ball cap into the slow-moving water , carried it quickly over , and with his cupped hand flicked a mist in my face . I raised up onto one elbow and reached stupidly , thinking there would be water to quench my raging thirst . It was nearly pitch black . The ground was warm and moist , and I could see arms and legs , but not faces . <p> Moments later the kids hurried off , the way sparrows do sensing danger . There was a crunch of footsteps , then Reverend Oliver crouched next to me with a can of something that faintly shined in the thin moonlight . I gulped from it . A soda . Orange , I thought , or maybe root beer . It 's funny , in the dark some of your senses become more acute and others you lose . Reverend Oliver took the empty can and leaned over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that down , too , but he poured it slowly over my head . <p> I was lying on the ground in the dark next to a river , my head and shirt soaked , with a man I had only just met that day . Yet I had a settled feeling . I could have slept right there , at the riverside . It would n't have surprised me one bit if Reverend Oliver asked me to stay the night , just to be safe . I half expected him to bend down , gather me up in his arms , and carry me to a soft cot in one of the cabins . <p> " Well , " I said , finally . " That was quite a scene in there . Very powerful . " <p> He did n't answer . I could feel his eyes on me in the darkness . A cold dampness seeped through my khakis at the hip where most of my weight was . I began to talk , the way I do when I 've had too much coffee , rambling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean anything to me , how it was just a habit . Religion class was required in college , but I was still confused about exactly who was who in the Bible . Reverend Oliver was a powerful speaker and I told him so , and how the choir and the music really knocked me out . I laughed at my own unintentional pun . Then I told him how shallow my life felt at times . There were a lot of questions that I had for him , although I was n't sure where to begin . I wished then that Reverend Oliver could talk to my ex , even both of us together , and I began to tell him about my problems with her . <p> " I have n't believed one thing about you was true since the minute you got here , " he said , cutting me off . His voice had a rough edge to it , like his cheek had earlier . He was kneeling close to me , silent for half a minute . Then Reverend Oliver rose and walked back toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he called out , " You 've got five minutes . " <p> My damp clothes kept me from getting drowsy most of the way back to Detroit . I checked into the Airport Hilton after midnight . When my wake-up call came I was already awake , sitting with my feet on the windowsill , watching the morning planes take off and land through the sheets of rain . The dried mud stains on my pants brought to mind Reverend Oliver and his camp . <p> In the lobby I picked up a Detroit Free Press , figuring I could read it at the airport . But then I called Tree , and he invited me to come visit him at the rec center before I left town . I 'd never gone to Detroit without seeing Tree . I re-booked my flight for midafternoon to keep from being rushed . <p> Tree was outside having a smoke when I arrived , staying dry in a doorway . He tried to crush me with a hug in the thick arms that you 'd expect on a guy with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . We slapped palms a few times and caught up on where his former players were . I presented him with a new State coaching shirt , still in the wrapper , a dark green polo type just like the one I had on . The shirt was my yearly offering to Tree . He embraced me again , calling me " My man , Coach Pytel . " That was what he always called me . My man . <p> Tree took me to see their new arts and crafts room , then chased a couple of kids out of his office so we could talk . The air was cool inside , the kind of cool that can make you sleepy after being in the summer heat . I wanted to tell him about my experience at the New Beginnings camp , how I 'd been hit with something that made me wonder what the hell we were all doing . How hurt I was that Reverend Oliver thought it was an act . I was n't exactly close to Tree , but we had helped each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> Before I could find the words , a girl maybe nineteen and wearing a halter top brought a stack of mail in . She sat down . Tree called her " Sugar " and told her he did n't have time to talk to her . Sugar , or whatever her name was , got a pouty look on her face and sat looking at him . He shuffled through some papers on his desk . She crossed her arms , then got up and left . <p> " My intern , " he said , winking at me , and we laughed . " How did it go with Jamal Davis ? " <p> " It was nearly three hours to get to the camp . " I smiled , so he would n't think I was complaining . " I thought it was here in the city . " <p> " Was it that far ? " he said , flipping through his mail . " I 've never been . Did Jamal see you ? " <p> " Sure . But that Reverend Oliver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . I do n't think he really warmed up to me . I mean , you said nobody was recruiting the kid , then this guy acts like I 'm dealing rocks or something . " <p> Tree leaned forward in his swivel chair . " Fuck Reverend Oliver , OK ? His selfrighteous preaching ass . I knew him in the old days , from way back . I know all about who he used to be . " <p> " He acted like he was pretty close to Jamal , " I said . " And I did n't make too good of an impression on him . " I should have told Tree right then some of the things that had bothered me the day before . About the clarity I felt in the church service , even though I was n't religious by anyone 's standard . And how trivial my job-basketball - made me feel . Maybe even ask Tree what he thought about my situation with Stephanie . <p> " That phony fool wo n't have nothing to do with Jamais decision , " Tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's different just cause he 's been to church . I could tell you some shit from that motherfucker 's past-I 'm talking when we was both in high school , twenty-five years ago-that the nigger should have been locked up for . " It seemed like maybe Tree was mad at me now , too , and I did n't want that either . " People do n't change that much , Pytel . I know who he used to be , so I know who he is . " He reached over and patted my shoulder . " And he ai n't gon na have shit to do with Jamal 's situation once he gets back from that fantasy camp in two weeks . I only agreed to let Jamal go cause he 's such a nice religioustype kid , and I wanted to get him out of Detroit . I raised the boy . " Tree leaned back again . <p> " I guess I feel better about it then , " I said . <p> Tree started in again . " You stay on Jamal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's gon na listen to me . I 'm telling you , you can sign him in November if your boss likes him . " That set my mind to rest a little bit . <p> Tree asked if I 'd read the morning newspaper , holding his up . I had n't ; mine was in the rental car . Turns out that Nate Wilkerson , who was too good for us even to imagine recruiting two years ago , was in some trouble . Nate Wilkerson had led the state of Michigan in scoring and rebounding as a high-school senior and was named to USA Today 's high-school All-American team . Tree had told me earlier not to waste my time recruiting him a year ago ; Wilkerson wanted to stay close to home and play in the Big Ten . Despite a great freshman season , he was leaving school and looking to transfer . We 'd made a splash at State with transfers like this . <p> " Why is he leaving school ? " I asked . <p> " He beat up his girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out of school ? " <p> " Broke her nose , " Tree said . " It 's the third time he 's had a problem . And the second girl . The other times did n't make it to the paper , so as far as you all are concerned it 's the first time . They just could n't keep him . " Tree opened up his palms to the ceiling , as if he were holding the guy out for me , and all I had to do was take him . <p> " What kind of kid is he ? " I got my pen out . <p> " Well ... he am t no great kid , " Tree said . " I mean he needs to get away . He 's too close to trouble now . You guys might be perfect for him cause you 're a long way from his friends . A fresh start for him . Chance to grow up . There 's just too much pussy running around at that school for him to focus . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Jamal Davis went . We 'd still go after him and sign him in the fall . But Nate Wilkerson would be our best player the day he arrived , the kind of guy that could lift us above the rest of our league . He would have to sit out a year anyway , as a transfer . The girlfriend stuff would blow over . We could get him with a school psychologist through Student Services . Maybe even help Nate Wilkerson to grow up . Cover ourselves at the very least , in case he got worse . I 'd spend lots of time with him during his redshirt year to help him mature . <p> " Make up your mind , " Tree said . <p> Author Affiliation
