Section : BUSINESS &; PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES Experience proves that to be successful , artists must understand the nature of the art market and the importance of fairness , honesty , and trust . <p> For many years , I have been advising artists , art dealers , publishers , and occasionally even collectors , regarding their art-marketing options . One common need that prompts a client to call on my services is to establish a focus in a market filled with many attractive opportunities . Much of my advice is centered on identifying each client 's unique capabilities and aspirations , but it also tries to address the basic function of the art market and how any artist may either work within certain segments of the market or be unnecessarily frustrated by it . <p> The first and most basic principle of the art market is that the most successful artists almost always have something important to offer the world in which they live and work , and that they need only appeal to a relatively modest number of discerning followers . They do n't need to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way that a prime-time sitcom requires millions of regular viewers . The varied functions of the art market have little or nothing to do with mass marketing or discount shopping . Those who attempt to employ the methods of the mass market in the art world have , on more than one occasion , succeeded as a sky-rocket burst on the scene , only to fade quickly from view . <p> Many artists make art simply to express themselves and to reach a few others . Some work a bit harder or they may be a bit more clever or lucky in building a larger collector base . They are recognized by a bigger but still very finite audience . In every case , the experiences of the artists and their audiences are matters of selective choice , differing significantly from time to time and from person to person . <p> While the art market is , in most ways , very different from ordinary commerce , there is one respect in which it is too much like many other business activities : It can be easily manipulated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have seen many instances of unethical , immoral , even illegal practices . There are , of course , other practices in the art world that are more foolish than venal . For instance , Mark Rothko used only very cheap paint , which made his work tend to fade or discolor with age . Framers often fail to urge their clients to employ archival mat boards , thus harming their prints over time . Their actions are not criminal ; they are just shortsighted . UNFAIR AGREEMENTS <p> Rufino Tamayo , the great Mexican artist , once showed me a contract he had unwittingly signed with a prominent New York dealer , the terms of which obligated him to share the proceeds of every work he sold in the United States , whether the dealer helped to generate the sale or not . I advised Tamayo to warn the dealer that he would either have to modify his agreement or face exposure in the art community for his unscrupulous behavior . Consequently , a revised agreement made it practical for Tamayo to work with other dealers in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attorneys of a famous American artist who was being restrained from selling works by a former art publisher . The two parties had a falling out , and under the terms of an unusual , highly one-sided agreement , the artist was restrained from offering any of his own works for sale . I advised the artist to appeal to the court regarding the fact that the publisher had failed to suggest that he seek competent counsel before signing their rather complex agreement . The court agreed that the artist had been an innocent dupe and that the onerous terms of the contract should be set aside . <p> In both of these cases , the artist had signed a one-sided agreement without taking the trouble to review that contract with knowledgeable , experienced people before agreeing to the terms being considered . Many artists are too trusting and too eager for representation for their own good . Not all proposed deals are worthy of an artist 's acceptance . DEALERS WHO CHEAT <p> I once worked with an art dealer whose married son was having a rough time getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's experience and knowledge and become an art dealer himself . He had to teach himself to sell art and then find a suitable and affordable location . Finding talented artists to represent was the easiest part of the job , because many qualified artists yearn for a dealer 's help . <p> The young man began earning a modest livelihood as an art dealer . Three years later , I heard he became slow in reporting gallery sales to his artists . Before long , it was found that he owed his artists more than $35,000 . <p> Too many dealers play loose and free with the money they owe artists . Still , almost all of those who cheat their artists become known as unreliable , as word circulates within the art world 's tight network of friends , acquaintances , and associates . I noted earlier that the market is made up of small segments , often defined by a few artists , their dealers , and their collectors , so the news spreads quickly when a particular dealer is not fair , honest , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust that person . <p> I urge my artist clients to be very careful with the consignment of their work . Before agreeing to leave artwork with a dealer , it is wise to speak with artists already represented there and visit the location unannounced to see how business is conducted . When my clients do agree to form a business relationship with a dealer , I remind them to keep good , complete records , try not to be too trusting , and ask to check inventories and see copies of sale invoices ( as provided under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code for consigned merchandise ) . ARTISTS WHO CHEAT <p> Dealers are not the only people who succumb to the power of greed ; artists can also be tempted to risk their professional standing . I once encountered an artist conspiring with a publisher of prints to secretly produce two identical versions of a limited edition of signed and numbered prints . Such misrepresentation is against the law in many states . Even if an artist does n't face prosecution , there is a risk of apprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same number of an edition . Of course , artists and their publishers have the right to produce editions of any size , scale , and medium they consider appropriate , but they must ask themselves if the career they have selected is one of creativity or fraud . They should not , and need not , misrepresent their work . Many states now require that publishers of multiples generate documentation that sets forth in considerable detail exactly what is being offered for sale . BACKDOOR DEALS <p> I have encountered artists whose dealers thought they had established an agreement granting them exclusive regional representation , only to discover that the artist was selling works inside the dealer 's territory , often at significant discounts , without reporting or sharing any of the proceeds with the dealer . When this happens , it often disrupts the trust that is so important to effective artist-dealer relations . <p> I once worked with a dealer who spent time and money organizing a university-museum exhibition for an important sculptor , and then added an elaborate , expensive opening reception . At that launch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce an important commission that did not provide any role or consideration for the dealer . Of course , the dealer learned of this backdoor arrangement and never again trusted that he would realize a return from investing in the artist 's career . In another , quite similar situation , a dealer became so unhappy after this kind of experience that he refused to continue representing living artists . <p> The greed of such artists often ends up hurting them as much as those whom they wrong . Contracts may be broken , and crooked , unfair business deals may end up damaging otherwise valuable working relationships . <p> In another part of the art world , the illegal pricing conspiracies of major auction houses have received a great deal of attention in the press over the past few years . Unfortunately , the reputation of the whole art market suffers when the public learns that important art transactions are not always based on trust and good taste . It calls to mind one of my mother 's favorite quotations from Sir Walter Scott : " Oh , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deceive ! " <p> By Calvin J. Goodman <p> <p> Calvin J. Goodman has written for American Artist for many years . He is the author of Art Marketing Handbook ( Gee Tee Bee , West Los Angeles , California ) . <p>
