Section : healthy pet KEEP YOUR WALK SAFE FROM AGGRESSIVE DOGS <p> Recently I grabbed the leash and ushered Jazz , my young Pembroke Welsh corgi , out the front door for our nightly stroll . Halfway through our walk , a black Labrador retriever scaled his 4foot front-yard fence and headed straight for us . I could hear his feet scraping the concrete sidewalk  --  and his low growl . <p> My first instinct : panic , and grab my 28-1b dog into my protective arms . Instead , I remembered my training . I calmly turned to avoid direct eye con- tact and guided my leashed dog to the middle of the quiet street . I sang out in a happy voice , " Hey , doggie , want a treat ? " as I tossed dog biscuits past the charging Lab in the direction farthest from us . Fortunately , the charging dog stopped , changed directions , and made a beeline for the tossed treats . <p> I quickly directed Jazz away from this dog 's home and out of harm 's way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky . Every year , more than 4 million Americans are bitten by dogs . These bites and attacks can occur anytime , anywhere , even when you are taking your leashed dog on what seems to be a safe route . Can You Read Canine ? <p> " Walking can be a good time to reinforce the social bonds between you and your dog , but it 's important for owners to be vigilant during these walks . Look and listen for possible signs of danger from other dogs , " says animal behaviorist Randy Lockwood , PhD , of The Humane Society of the United States . " Many such problems can be avoided by reading the body postures displayed by your dog and the approaching . dog . Friendly dogs tend to approach one another in a nondirect way , give a high-pitched bark or yip , and may get into a play bow with their front legs stretched out low and their backs raised up . " <p> Heed these danger signs of approaching dogs looking for a fight : <p> <p> Hard , intense stares <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> Raised lip or snarl <p> <p> Tense body , tail held high and stiff , and standing forward on front toes <p> " Most dogs give warnings that you need to respect , " says Lockwood . So You 'll Do . What ? <p> The best offense is still a good defense . Counter these postures by avoiding direct eye contact , moving slowly away in a diagonal direction ( far from the aggressive dog 's turf , such as his yard ) , offering treats tossed at a safe distance , keeping your dog calm by maintaining a loose but steady grip on the leash , and speaking in a calm , confident tone . <p> If a dog attacks your dog , do not try to break up the fight by putting yourself physically between the two dogs . You risk getting bitten by either  --  or both dogs . Also resist the inclination to pick up your dog because you 'll prevent him from communicating signals of confidence , appeasement , or submission that might end the conflict naturally . Instead , hurl your keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fighting dogs . <p> Any of these actions are designed to interrupt the flow of the fight enough to confuse the dogs or to distract them enough to get them to calm down . <p> If you 're aware of a troublesome dog , plan a new route , but for sudden emergencies , carry a self-defense kit . ( See " For Safety 's Sake " ) Who 's in Charge ? <p> Even dogs who are on leashes can be potential fight seekers . Never accept an owner 's " My dog is friendly " comment without studying the dog 's bod language . Equally vital : Size up the dog 's owner before consenting to let the two leashed dogs meet , says Shannon Torres-Sharon , a professional dog walker who spends 10 hours each day walking up to 30 dogs for clients in the busy streets of New York City . <p> " As they approach , watch to see if the other owner has control of his dog and if the leash is loose , " says Tortes-Sharon . " The owner should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are signs that the dog is in charge , not the owner . When you see this type of action , cross the street , and walk on the other sidewalk to avoid a direct meeting . " <p> Another meet-and-greet tip : Read your dog 's body cues before deciding if this introduction will be welcomed . <p> " Never force your dog into an introduction , especially if he stiffens or tries to hide behind your legs , his lips pucker , or he starts to growl , " says Lockwood . " If your dog starts to yawn or do lip licking , these are calming signals to tell you and the approaching dog that your dog is not comfortable with an interaction . " <p> Your biggest asset in avoiding walking wars is establishing an attitude of being a calm-but-in-charge leader to your dog . Use these daily walks to reinforce basic obedience commands such as sit , stay , and come . Pack some treats or toys to shift your dog 's attention away from other dogs and toward you and the walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a strange , unsupervised dog approaches is a good way to lessen the likelihood of triggering an attack , " says Lockwood . QUICK TIP : <p> Report any dog attacks to local animal control officers , even if you or your dog were not harmed . For Safety 's Sake <p> These items can make your walk safer for you and your dog : <p> <p> The right leash . Use a 6-foot leash , or avoid too much slack if you use reel-type leashes because you lose control over your dog . <p> <p> Either a commercial citronella spray , such as Direct Stop , or water sprayed from a drink bottle can help distract dogs in a fight . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Bad dog coming  --  are you ready ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Socialize  --  safely <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Should you trust this face ? <p> By Arden Moore , editor <p> <p> Pet expert Arden Moore is the award-winning author of The Kitten Owner 's Manual ( Storey Books , 2001 ) and Dog Training : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor of Catnip magazine .
