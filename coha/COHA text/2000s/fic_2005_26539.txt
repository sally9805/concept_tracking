" If you fail teleschool again , your mom and I will have to watch sixty hours of parenting classes . Sixty hours of idiots telling me how to get my son to do better on his television tests .

From her stall at the flea market in Times Square , Polly Pritchard watched the bustle of the vendors behind aging stands , the brightly colored signs of all shapes and sizes , and the crowds of worried-looking people carrying shopping bags . She reminded herself that she did n't know what else to do . Although she had been a nationally recognized student on EduTV , she had lost her Toss . Her mother was disabled . A few years ago , her father had died of tuberculosis . Without the help of a Toss scholarship , she had no money to continue in school . When the flea market offered her father 's old stall , she had to take it . So here she was today , working as a memorist for the first time . Mr. Pebst , her father 's former partner , had willingly given her the money for the stall in exchange for an agreement that she would give him twenty percent of her take . " Are you as good as your father ? " Mr. Pebst had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Nobody was as good as him . In the twenty years that I knew him , he never once got anything wrong .

She had learned many of her facts from reading the World Book encyclopedia . But most of her business would be from shoppers . Polly 's head was full of jumbled phrases from the morning 's paper and from the bulletin boards she had read on her way to work : " Instant Travel , the world 's first human fax . " " Fastgrow : Watch your hair grow one foot each night or your money back . " " Dream Hat : Finally you can photograph your dreams . " " Help the victims of the Urban Trash Wars by donating to . . .

A customer , her first , hobbled toward her . The old woman scrutinized Polly 's face for a second before bursting out , " I need to know if there are any used televisions for sale . They 'll take my grandkids from me if I do n't have a television . " Polly nodded . Everybody knew that the law required all kids under the age of fourteen to watch thirty hours of teleschool a week . " I 'll pay you a dime . That 's all you 're worth . " The old woman 's teeth were the brown , unhealthy color of the endless smog that blanketed the city . " Okay . " Polly tried to ignore the woman 's rudeness . Once her mother had been unable to afford a television repairman , and her fear had made her grouchy too . The old woman flung the dime into Polly 's empty jar .

" I saw it on a bulletin board . " " I want my dime back if you 're wrong , " the old woman warned her . Polly shrugged and wondered how her father had worked at this job for thirty years .
