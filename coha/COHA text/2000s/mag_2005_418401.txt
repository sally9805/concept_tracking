Chuck Klosterman celebrates twenty-one high-quality albums from the past three years ( in no particular order ) // I listen to modern rock " n ' roll music . This is because I do n't have a real job . People who have real jobs do n't listen to contemporary rock music . People who have real jobs watch network TV and go to sleep ; that 's pretty much their entire social life . A month after Morrissey released Maladjusted in 1997 , I called the most intense heterosexual Morrissey fan I knew , and I said , " You know , critics are attacking this record for being sonically maudlin and lyrically lazy , but there are some interesting songs here . It 's not as deep as Vauxhall and I , but it 's uuorth buying . " His response : " Morrissey still makes records ? " Of course , this was coming from an electrical engineer with a family and a dog named Simon and a house he has n't paid for ; ie stopped listening to new music in late 1995 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new music sounds ridiculous . And this is because new music always sounds ridiculous to anyone who quit buying records when he was twenty-six . The moment you stop buying music is the moment it becomes alienating . That 's why everyone insists that most good music was ( coincidentally ) recorded between their sophomore year in high school and their senior year of college . Luckily , this will never happen to me . This will never happen to me because I will never have a real job . In fact , I will listen to new music for you . Here are twenty-one albums that you can either a ) buy or b ) pretend to already like . Now , one warning : If you already consider yourself cool , do n't read this article . This article is for people who realize they 're no longer cool ( and who sometimes worry about that realization , perhaps more than they are willing to admit ) . 1 The Hold Steady , Almost Killed Me ( 2004 ) : Hailing from uptown Minneapolis , the Hold Steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record ends up feeling like an ironist'siorn to Run . The singer ( Craig Finn ) likes to make up nicknames for people you 've never met , including himself ; he also hates guys who wear eye patches , and he 's possibly the best lyricist of the past decade . You utill like this album if you used to like AC/DC but now you just read a lot . 2 The Exploding Hearts , Guitar Romantic ( 2003 ) : Three members of this four-piece briefly became famous when they all died at once , in a van accident near Eugene , Oregon , in 2003 . This is the best kind of punk rock-catchy , unobnoxious , danceable , and Clash-derivative . You mill like this album if you are happy to be alive . 3 My Morning Jacket , It Still Moves ( 2003 ) : This is big , southern , drunken , heavily bearded power rock . The songs are long and wide and deep ; the riffs feel like they were recorded in a studio inside Skylab ( after it had started to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in Louisville , they would have made It Still Moves . You will like this album if you like flying-Vguitars and grizzly bears . 4 Coachuuhips , Peanut Butter and Jelly Live at the Ginger Minge ( 2005 ) : There is a lot to despise about this record , namely the title ( which is both moronic and inaccurate , as the album is not live ) . The Coachwhips also have a tendency to dabble in the genre of noise rock , and that 's almost always a recipe for cyclone-level disaster . Yet there is something about this record that captures time and space ; it 's like the soundtrack for a runaway horse carriage . I suspect that the Coachwhips wanted to make garage rock and accidentally turned into a thrash band , and the result is way better than if they had tried to do that on purpose . You will like this album if your problems with the White Stripes are with Jack ( as opposed to Meg ) . 5 The Black Keys , The Big Come Up ( 2002 ) : This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a color . I have no idea where they came up with this idea , but it seems to be working . The Black Keys have made two albums since The Big Come Up , but this is the one you should buy ; they cover the Beatles and periodically sound like Mountain , which is an intriguing confluence of impractical influences . You will like this album if you support the reintroduction of blue-eyed , Mayallesque blues structures filtered through the artifice of slacker sloppiness , or if you used to work at the Akron Beacon Journal with the drummer 's father , reporter Jim Carney. 6 Suffrajett , SuffraJeft ( 2003 ) : This is a dirty record about sex and drugs , cowritten by a guitarist who used to cowrite Liz Phair songs ( Jason Chasko ) and sung by an exotic creature named Simi who sounds like she swallowed a tumbler of rock salt and Drano . It 's low-fi grunge hair metal , which is kind of like calling someone a pragmatically cynical optimist . You mill like this album if you tend to be frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machines , Now Here Is Nowhere ( 2004 ) : Sadly , the music on this opus does not accurately replicate the group 's live performances , mostly because the drummer is an insane werewolf who hits his cymbals the way Mike Tyson hit Trevor Berbick 's rib cage in 1986 . You simply can not record that kind of violence . Still , the first two songs on Now Here Is Nowhere are good enough to play anywhere at any time , especially if " anywhere " is your car and " any time " is 3:00 A.M. You will like this album if you still occasionally buy drugs . 8 Electric Six , Fire ( 2003 ) : At first blush , Fire sounds a little like joke rock ( a quality accentuated by the fact that the band sent out a press release about their potential breakup before anyone even knew who the fuck they were ) . However , Fire is more like postmodern fashion rock , which means the singer is adopting all the clichs of arena metal because he honestly thinks they 're cool ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena-metal clichs tuheneverthey want to be funny ) . This makes the Electric Six fabricated and authentic at the same time . In other words , you will like this album if you like the notion of Van Halen more than you liked any of their actual albums. 9 The Hellacopters , Cream of the Crap ! Vol. 2 ( 2005 ) : This is an anthology of distorted , up-tempo Swedish funeral dirges that includes a cover of " All American Man " ( offside four of Kiss 's Alive If ) and a cover of " Dirty Women " ( off Black Sabbath 's jazz-metal effort Technical Ecstasy ) . Apparently , I am now a target market in Stockholm . You will like this album if you always think that music on classic-rock radio stations should be slightly faster and slightly louder . 10 The Thrills , So Much for the City ( 2003 ) : The Thrills are five guys from Ireland who are obsessed with the soulless iconography of California and the day-to-day lifestyle of Gram Parsons . In other words , they are all ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record feel optimistic , but the words are jaded . The singer says we should never go back to Big Sur , but he never says what happened the last time we were there . You will like this album if your apartment is actually a bar . 11 Courtney Love , America 's Sweetheart ( 2004 ) : Hole'sLive Through This was released four days after Kurt Cobain 's corpse was found by his electrician in 1994 . As a consequence , critics spent ten years talking about how Live Through This was " overlooked , " and how it was supposedly some kind of sublime , underrated classic . Which is weird , because it contained only three good songs . Meanwhile , everyone ripped on America 's Sweetheart as an uneven , self-indulgent train wreck ... but this is actually the first good record Courtney Love has ever made ! You will like this album if you are writing a dissertation on metacommunicative discourse and/or crack whores . 12 Drive-By Truckers , Southern Rock Opera ( 2002 ) : When the boys in this band were growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rednecks who blasted Lynyrd Skynyrd in the locker room before football practice . But then the Truckers left town and traveled America , only to realize that people who are not from the south do not understand the south . They had to reclaim southern rock in order to understand its larger truth . There is a song on this double CD ( " Let There Be Rock " ) that 's as sincere as anything ever written by Neil Young or Ronnie Van Zant ... which , according to their song " Ronnie and Neil , " should be the core purpose of rock music . You will like this album if you like America . 13 The Fiery Furnaces , Galloujsbird 's Bark ( 2003 ) : A brother and sister from Illinois who seem like they should be from Eastern Europe , Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger create the kind of music that makes people say , " What the fuck is this ? " And that 's not because it 's relentlessly inaccessible or unspeakably brilliant , but because this seems like such a strange vision for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally ineludes the sound of birds chirping . You like this album if you enjoy the music on NPR 's Fresh Air more than anything else on the radio . 14 Gonga , Gonga ( 2004 ) : This band smokes so much pot that they were n't able to name two of the songs on their debut album ; track 4 is called " Untitled No. 2 , " and track 8 is called " Untitled No. 3 . " I have no idea what happened to " Untitled No. 1 . " Perhaps it was converted into track 10 , which is called " Octane Bud . " This plutonium power riffage might be the heaviest record since the Melvins ' Stoner Witch . You will like this album if you think Queens of the Stone Age kind of seem like pussies. 15 Wilco , Yankee hotel Foxtrot ( 2002 ) : Last summer , Wilco released A Ghost Is Born , oihich I played about ten thousand times before publicly decreeing that it uias the band 's best record to date ( and that it was more " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention for nonmusical reasons ) . Then I went backand played this album again . It turns out I was completely wrong . Yankee hotel Foxtrot is not as weird as A Ghost Is Born , but it 's uuay more moving . " Jesus , Etc. " is the most abstractly emotive song of the past decade , and I think " Ashes of American Flags " might be about raking the lawn . You will like this album if you ever have to rake the lawn . 16 Weezer ' Maladroit ( 2002 ) : This is Weezer 's most aggressively " metal " record even though none of it is remotely heavy . Which is good- " rock " should be heavy , but " metal " should be hard . You will like this album if you immediately understand the difference between those two things . 17 Elliott Smith , From a Basement on the Hill ( 2004 ) : This posthumous release is the one profoundly great Elliott Smith record , which is n't going to make it any easier to stop romanticizing artists who spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this album if you enjoy the hypothetical possibility of a really depressed Beatle. 18 Belle and Sebastian , Dear Catastrophe Waitress ( 2003 ) : This album sounds like it was recorded by a bunch of precocious third graders who like to frolic in the meadow with imaginary marmots and a bubble machine . In the Spike Lee movie 25th Hour , Edward Norton gets sentenced to prison and has to choose between two longtime friends , Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour Hoffman : One needs to beat him up so he 'll look tough enough to survive in the hole ( this ends up being Pepper ) , and the other has to look after his dog while Norton 's locked away ( this ends up being Hoffman ) . If you 're the kind of guy who would be asked to kick the shit out of your own friend , you are probably not in Belle and Sebastian 's core demographic . However , you mill like this album if you 're the kind of loyal companion who would be asked to take care of somebody 's hound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : This is a band that makes tight , accessible , original , hook-laden pop music , and it is cofronted by a stone fox ( Neko case ) who 's dead sexy x 400 . If you were trying to design a rock band for the sole purpose of beingpopular , this is the rock band you would create . However , nobody likes the New Pornographers except rock critics . It 's like they 're this indie-rock version of Blondie , and no one seems to care . You will like this album if you generally like things that are good . 20 Evan Dando , Baby I 'm Bored ( 2003 ) : It 's possible that you remember the Lemonheads as kind of bad , because many people seem to remember them in that context . In truth , the Lemonheads were often excellent ( especially on It 's a Shame About Ray ) , and this goofy , lackadaisical solo effort from their former dreamboat vocalist is chock-full of likable material . Dando sounds like a drug addict , and that might be an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidenced by his performance during the closing credits of Reality Bites ) . You mill like this album if you are nostalgic for the very recent past . 21 TV on the Radio , Desperate Youth , Blood Thirsty Babes ( 2004 ) : This is an interesting record . Actually , that 's not true . This is a bad record . This is a stupid doo-wop noise-pop record that ( on occasion ) accidentally sounds like Beck 's Midnite Vultures . But you mill like this album if you are trying to nail some superhot hipster chick in your office who only sleeps with cool guys . <p>
