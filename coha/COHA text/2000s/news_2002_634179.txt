<p> Fresh out of college and full of ambition , Elaine joined Arthur Andersen LLP a couple of years ago . <p> She knew all about Andersen . She knew they were the nation 's fifth-largest accounting firm . She knew they were rated among the best , most progressive workplaces in the country . And she knew they were praised for being ramrod straight in their accounting . Andersen was the accounting world 's " gold standard . " <p> " I thought the Andersen name would look great on my resume , " said Elaine , who asked that her real name not be used . " It 's a company with a great reputation . " <p> But that was then , and this is now . <p> " Now , the first thing they 'll think of is Enron , " she said . " This is not a reputable company anymore . " <p> For the sin of certifying that the bankrupt Enron Corp . was financially sound , and for destroying Enron documents even while a federal probe was under way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nightmarish accumulation of civil lawsuits and fleeing clients that has left Andersen weaker by the day . <p> The indictment named only the firm itself and no individuals . But the indictment might just as well have named Elaine and every other employee at Andersen  --  5,500 in Chicago and another 80,000 worldwide . They will all suffer if Andersen collapses . When a company 's reputation is everything , an indictment  --  even without a conviction  --  can be devastating . <p> Andersen itself calls it a " death penalty . " <p> *** <p> Inside Andersen 's world headquarters at 33 W. Monroe  --  28 floors of ergonomic rectitude and " team style " furniture layouts  --  employees are both seething and panicked . They wonder why the whole company is being made to pay for the mistakes of a few  --  that 's why they seethe  --  and where their careers have gone  --  that 's why they panic . Most never touched the Enron account or the accounts of other firms , such as Sunbeam and Waste Management , that have made Andersen 's work suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front pages last fall , Elaine updated her resume . And in recent weeks , she has begun looking for a new job in earnest . " I have n't had a single interview yet , " she said . <p> The atmosphere around Andersen 's cubicles and corridors was eerily sullen when the worst news hit last week , including the Justice Department 's announcement of the grand jury indictment . The firm is accused of shredding " tons " of Enron documents , mostly in its Houston office , to thwart a federal probe of the Enron bankruptcy . <p> " It 's sad to know that we could potentially lose our jobs because of nothing , and to know that the Justice Department would go this far , " said Debra , who declined to give her last name . " I like the firm . The firm has been very good to me . The benefits are good . The Justice Department has just made it very sad to work here . " <p> Another employee , Deb Parker , 30 , interviewed as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better today " than she had all week , having just sat through a two-hour " town hall meeting " called by her managers . " I think people are starting to feel motivated again , " said Parker , who works in Andersen 's consulting department . " If anyone can get through this , Andersen can . " <p> Some employees are even talking about staging a pro-Andersen rally , perhaps in Springfield . <p> The biggest blow to Andersen 's morale might not have come when the indictment was announced , however , but a few days earlier  --  on Monday morning . That was when employees were greeted at their desks by voice mails from Andersen brass alerting them to the big story in that day 's papers : Andersen was in talks to sell all or pieces of itself to two rivals , Deloitte &; Touche LLP and Ernst &; Young LLP . <p> Clearly , everybody agreed in whispered tones , Andersen was desperate . Elevator rides became awkwardly silent . <p> " The reality really sunk in for people , " a mid-level executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in denial . But a sale would mean the end of the Andersen culture , not to mention who knows how many jobs . " <p> Employees interviewed praised management for keeping employees up-to-date and discussing the company 's prospects , often at the town hall meetings held in conference rooms . The meetings , they said , stirred feelings of defiance mixed with hope . But as Andersen 's troubles continued to grow over the week , so did the sour mood . <p> " It kept escalating with big clients leaving , " Elaine said . " On Monday , with the possibility of a sale , combined with possible federal indictment , everyone went into panic mode . People started running for the hills . It no longer could be forgotten or put under the carpet . " <p> Gallows humor is everywhere . " Oh , sure  --  Shredded Wheat in the morning , " one man said . " You hear that . " <p> But all jokes aside , it 's tough working for a firm that has become grist for late-night comedians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , you know , it still hurts , " Elaine said . <p> When the talk turns serious in the office , the words grow fewer . " ' I do n't know ' is a phrase you hear a lot around here these days , " said one executive . " It 's a new corporate slogan . " <p> Andersen retirees and ex-workers speculate that younger workers will be the quickest to bolt , while the senior staff will be more inclined to fight it out , even riding down to a crash , if that happens . <p> Many employees , however , may have little choice in the matter . They are the partners , the owners of Andersen . Experts say some partners pull down in excess of $1 million a year , and they have more than that to lose . <p> To become partners , executives must sink hundreds of thousands of dollars into the firm as capital . The incentive is that they get to share in future profits and , in retirement , sell their stake and live in luxury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enjoyed a sterling reputation , few thought a partnership would be risky . But just as Andersen 's liabilities mount , its clients are jumping ship . More than three dozen clients have dropped Andersen , including two of Chicago 's elite , Sara Lee Corp . and Abbott Laboratories . <p> " The partners are watching their investment go south , " said an Andersen alumnus , Gerrit Van Wissink . " Some may be in denial mode . They can be complacent , but it was the culture of the firm that got them into trouble in the first place . " <p> A consultant with close ties to Andersen said : " The partners feel a certain degree of loyalty to Andersen . But this loyalty is starting to be overtaken by a sense of desperation . They have golden cuffs that tie them to the firm , but those cuffs are loosening with concerns about liabilities . And the labor market , because of the bad economy , is not good . Some are thinking about doing something they had never considered doing before  --  jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners , he said , are " in a funk , waiting to see which partner or group will be the first to leave . There will be a torrent after that . Nobody wants to be the one left to turn off the lights . " <p> All of this has some Andersen employees longing for the innocence of last year , when another challenge  --  building Andersen 's brand name  --  seemed so important . <p> The firm had split with a rakish corporate cousin , the former Andersen Consulting , and it feared that the business world did n't really know what the seemingly stodgier Andersen did anymore . <p> So the bosses cooked up an image and branding campaign . It would be built around one word  --  " Andersen "  --  and emphasize that the firm is no longer just a financial auditor , but offers a range of consulting services . <p> As it happens , chasing that consulting business is what got Andersen into trouble with Enron , which paid Andersen more than $25 million a year . <p> Elaine sees the irony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Contributing : Janet Rausa Fuller
