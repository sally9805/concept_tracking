BAG BONUS Any precious possessions you pack are now covered by a higher payout if an airline loses your bags on a domestic trip . The Department of Transportation has upped the airlines ' liability limit for lost , delayed or damaged luggage , from $1,250 to $2,500 a passenger . But if you 're flitting off to a foreign locale and you lose your bag , too bad . Airlines are obligated to pay just $9.07 a lb. or $640 a suitcase . So pack light , and always keep your valuables , such as jewelry and breakables , with you . <P> E-ROB Some 150 buyers are claiming they got ripped off by a seller on eBay . Although crooks represent just a tiny fraction of transactions , Internet fraud is rising : complaints increased 38% last year . How do you avoid it ? Either pay by credit card or use an escrow service that wo n't release your money to the seller until you 've got your goods . It costs a couple of bucks for each transaction , but it 's worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day traders are getting into tax trouble because they do n't know the law . Yes , the maximum capital gains rate is 20% . But it applies only to long-term holdings  --  at least a year . Otherwise , the gain is income and taxed up to 39.6% . The lesson : it may be worth sitting on a stock a little longer to qualify it as a long-term holding . Even if the stock falls , say , 25% ; and you 're in the top bracket , you 'll probably break even because the lower tax rate will offset the price dip . <P>  --  By Anamaria Wilson
