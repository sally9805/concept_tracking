A kid sits playing a video game on his TV while a bouncing ball frantically tries to get his attention . It nudges him , gets in his face and finally knocks the power cord out of the outlet . At last the boy gets the message , stands up and takes the ball outside to play . The tag line : YOUR BALL NEEDS YOU . <P> What 's surprising about this irresistibly catchy ad is that it was created not by a fitness-advocacy group or a health organization but by Nickelodeon , a TV network aimed squarely at kids . Like any commercial network , Nickelodeon ( or Nick , as it is universally called ) is out to make money . Keeping viewers attached solidly to their seats is the traditional way to do that . But Nick also wants to be more than just a medium for selling toys and sugary processed food . " Our mantra is , what 's good for kids is good for business , " says Marva Smalls , chief of staff for Nick and its sister networks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a history of trying to help kids deal with tough issues . " <P> About a year ago , Smalls and her colleagues decided to go after one of those issues : the decline of simple play in kids ' lives . School districts were cutting out recess and physical-education ( PE ) classes to save money ; kids in high-crime areas were afraid to go outside ; organized sports were becoming high-stress activities , with parents getting into fistfights over disputed referee calls . And too many children were glued to the couch , playing video games and watching television . <P> So Nick put together a campaign it called Let 's Just Play , which included not only on-air spots but also a series of events co-sponsored by the Boys and Girls Clubs of America in six major cities , including Houston ; Spokane , Wash. ; Miami ; and Atlanta . Thousands of kids showed up last summer to participate in all sorts of physical activities , and the program is expanding this year to take in more cities . Beyond that , Nick is planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants to schools and other organizations . The money will help reinstate PE classes and create after-school destinations where kids can play safely . <P> Nick is n't focusing on just physical activity . The network has commissioned research to understand how kids make eating choices . It 's also working with food companies that use characters like SpongeBob SquarePants to decorate their packages with splashy blurbs filled with facts about nutrition . And that , says Smalls , will be great for business : " If we connect with kids and arm them with the tools they need to navigate difficult issues , then when they do want to watch television , they 'll come back to us.
