I do n't think I 've ever used the term ravishing ; but in describing the knockout beauty of HEDY LAMARR , star of more than 25 films , it is the only word that seems to fit . All of us who knew her will tell you she had a great sense of humor . And she was smart too . I first met Hedy at the Hollywood Canteen  --  she was handing out autographs ... I was washing dishes . That 's not quite true  --  she was a regular there , and danced and talked with the servicemen , cooked and served the food . My doing the dishes  --  now , that 's true . Not a very good billing then , but I shared equal billing with her in our film My Favorite Spy in 1951 . I played two parts , and both of them were Hedy 's lovers . How about that for overtime ? <P> At the Academy Awards , she was always good material . In 1943 I got laughs with , " During the dinner , I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat next to Hedy Lamarr and had to act as though I was interested in the food . " <P> After six marriages ( not all at the same time , mind you ) and filmmaking , Hedy Lamarr retired to a simple life in Florida . We got her to venture back to California in September 1966 to appear on my special at NBC . She was reserved , smart and beautiful . And to her friends and fans  --  that 's how she 'll always be . <P>  --  Bob Hope , comedian
