<p> The fight for control of the Sierra Club - with its 750,000 members , rich political clout and an $ 81 million annual budget - has been decades in the making . <p> And the man behind it every step of the way has been John Tanton , called by critics a ' puppeteer ' of the national movement to restrict immigration to the United States . <p> ' If I 'm the puppeteer , then they are the puppets , ' chortled the 70-year-old retired Michigan ophthalmologist , referring to his critics in a recent interview . ' I move and they jump . ' <p> He denies orchestrating the explosive Sierra Club board election , but all the key players , including former Colorado Democratic Gov . Dick Lamm , are moving to Tanton 's beat . <p> Lamm , who wrote the preface to Tanton 's latest book , ' Common Sense on Mass Immigration , ' defends Tanton as ' a remarkable man , very deep and complex . ' <p> The Sierra Club will soon elect five new board members in mail-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted on April 21 . Three members already on the 15-member board were backed by Sierrans pushing the anti-immigration issue . Five more would mean a majority that would control the club 's budget and political agenda , making immigration an environmental cause . <p> Lamm , 68 , is one of Tanton 's oldest friends and closest allies in the population-control movement . <p> While both Tanton and Lamm say their concerns are about preserving the planet and traditional American culture , critics say their opinions border on racist and xenophobic demagoguery . <p> Their claim is buoyed by a 1986 memo Tanton delivered to the Federation for American Immigration Reform , or FAIR , a group he founded , funded and continues to help direct . <p> ' As Whites see their power and control over their lives declining , will they simply go quietly into the night ? ' he wrote . ' Or will there be an explosion ? Why do n't non-Hispanic Whites have a group identity , as do Blacks , Jews , Hispanics ? ' <p> Lamm acknowledges that the debate about immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but says it takes brave leaders to decide what 's politically incorrect and what 's politically necessary . <p> ' What we 're saying is , culture matters , ' Lamm said . ' I think one of the most important questions facing Americans is , how do they preserve their culture with this onslaught of new people and new cultures diluting what we are and who we are ? ' <p> Since 1996 , the Sierra Club has taken neutral positions on U.S. immigration to push global population remedies instead . <p> The possible ascendancy of Lamm and like-minded candidates frightens many longtime Sierrans who fear a radical club that spews anti-immigration rhetoric . <p> The anti-immigration issue has shaken the venerable liberal group to its core , and many of the club 's top officers said they fear a ' hostile takeover ' of the board . <p> Besides their views on culture , Tanton and Lamm share similar concerns about the impact of overpopulation on the environment . <p> ' You can give up on the environment when you have a Colorado of 12 million people , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of 4.4 million in the next 50 years . <p> Tanton said he and others associated with his movement have their eyes on the Sierra Club for one reason : The depletion of resources by overpopulation will crumble the quality of life for his grandchildren and their children . <p> He includes old-fashioned American culture among those resources . <p> No racist conspiracy binds the two leaders , however , Lamm said . <p> Lamm concedes he was recruited to run for the board by Sierra Club members trying to force the organization 's hand on immigration . <p> They , not him , collected the 400 signatures he needed to get on the ballot , he said . He never saw who signed the names on the petition nominating him , so he could n't vouch for their politics , he said . <p> Tanton said he is not a racist schemer , and the ' project ' to redirect the Sierra Club is not his . <p> ' And if it was , I would n't be talking about it , ' he said . ' It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it 's brought a lot of attention to the immigration question . ' <p> Eleven past Sierra Club presidents , in a Jan. 15 letter , warned members to ' expose the motives , background and financial backing of those who would be part of controlling the board in order to promote their own egos and agendas . ' <p> ' This issue is tearing us apart at the seams , ' said Larry Fahn , the club 's national president . <p> A long-promised campaign <p> For the Sierra Club , the current fight is more evolutionary than revolutionary . <p> In the 1986 memo to FAIR , Tanton declared war on club members reluctant to take on the flashpoint issue of U.S. immigration . He pledged to pull the Sierra Club into the growing fray over illegal residents . <p> ' The Sierra Club wo n't touch immigration , but immigration will touch the Sierra Club , ' Tanton wrote . <p> Sierra Club leaders , for their part , believe Tanton 's memo was the first splash in what has become a growing tide that now engulfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Fahn said . <p> In 1996 , the board voted to take a neutral position on immigration , and two years later - in what opponents called a rigged election - the club 's membership voted 60 percent to 40 percent to remain neutral on immigration . <p> New Census Bureau numbers could only fuel fears . A census report released this month predicts that Asian-American and Latino populations will double by 2050 , leaving whites clinging to a slim population majority . <p> But to Sierra Club member Ross Vincent of Pueblo , the fight over immigration detracts from core environmental issues that the club needs to be fighting now . <p> ' It 's a naive position , ' he said of those who favor higher fences at the border to slow U.S. population growth . ' National borders should be irrelevant . You could seal all the borders tomorrow , and world population would not change one bit . All you 're doing is forcing migrants to go somewhere else . ' <p> Immigration-control ' does not stop urban sprawl , and it does n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people I talk to are concerned about , ' Vincent said . <p> Vincent wo n't vote for Lamm primarily because Lamm joined the club only weeks before announcing his candidacy for the board . <p> Lamm says that 's a good enough reason for any Sierran not to vote for him . <p> ' There 's all kinds of reasons not to vote for Dick Lamm , ' he said , citing his short history as a member . ' But thinking I 'm a racist is not one of them . ' <p> Joining Lamm at the top of the immigration-issue ticket is Frank Morris , an African-American , the former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation , a professor at historically black colleges and a recipient of three top NAACP awards . <p> Morris said he is chiefly looking out for his race . <p> Other minorities are more highly favored than blacks in the eyes of white America , and every new brown or yellow face pushes a black person a step further back in the line , he said . <p> ' African-Americans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired , ' Morris said . <p> He is angry that the Sierra Club is charging racism against those trying to get on the board and shift its mission on immigration . <p> ' When you have people trying to play the race card inappropriately , that bothers me , ' he said . <p> A Sierra Club member since 1998 , Morris said he ran for the board at the urging of one of its current members , UCLA physics and astronomy professor Ben Zuckerman . <p> Zuckerman also is a close Tanton ally who promotes his message and defends him in e-mails to current and former Sierra Club board members . <p> Zuckerman , a 35-year Sierra Club member and a board member since 2002 , is vice president of Californians for Population Stabilization - an immigration-focused organization founded by Tanton in 1996 that includes Lamm on its advisory board . <p> Among other groups founded - or funded - by Tanton is American Patrol , a brash anti-immigration group that the discrimination-fighting Southern Poverty Law Center in Alabama has branded a hate group for its racially insensitive rhetoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving money to American Patrol for computers to help the group get started , but said he does not control its agenda . <p> He also founded and still sits on the board of FAIR , the nation 's premier immigration-restriction group , which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from foundations controlled by Richard Mellon Scaife , the Republican who financed investigations and other initiatives against President Clinton . <p> Tanton 's organizations also have taken money from the Pioneer Fund , a group that once funded research on eugenics , the scientific examination of differences in races , to promote racial purity . <p> That fund also is widely accused of bankrolling anti-desegregation efforts in the South decades ago . <p> Tanton said the Pioneer Fund also donates to dozens of universities , including Johns Hopkins , Cornell Medical School , Brandeis , the University of California at Berkeley , the University of London and the University of Tel Aviv . <p> Meanwhile , Tanton , Lamm , Morris and others say ' old guard ' board members and top staff are slandering them to retain power over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to members , including 22,500 in Colorado . It includes an unusual notice from the board urging members to be wary of some candidates because they may be doing the bidding of outside forces trying to hijack the organization . <p> The board also took the unusual step of including three candidates who had no interest in winning , but are running to draw attention to candidates pushed by the anti-immigration movement . <p> One of them is Morris Dees , founder and leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center . <p> In his 400-word essay that accompanied his name on the ballot , Dees said he did not want votes from Sierra Club members because , like Lamm , he has no history with the club . Dees said he wanted to bring attention to ' radical anti-immigration activists ' in the race . <p> He cited Tanton and urged Sierrans not to allow the ' greening of hate ' by electing Lamm , Morris or Cornell University biologist Frank Pimentel . <p> Pimentel is a contributor and source in the Tanton-published quarterly magazine ' The Social Contract , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Secret motives feared <p> None of more than 15 Sierra Club members , current and past board members or presidents interviewed for this story openly called any of the candidates racists , but they did not spare that description for Tanton . <p> Their greatest fear is not the candidates , but the appearance of radical , secret motives to acquire control of the club . Some even suspected that the attention and controversy that Lamm and others have brought to this year 's campaign was as much a publicity stunt as an earnest campaign . <p> For example , they said , the club has a referendum on the immigration issue next year , essentially deciding whether to officially stamp America 's immigration , welfare and education policies as the next environmental frontier . <p> For certain , the election has opened a gulf between those who want to justify immigration limits by pointing to future environmental impacts , and those who say it is too socially charged when plenty of more consensual environmental issues are starving for attention - including unseating President Bush this fall . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push on the immigration issue . He laid the bitter divide at the feet of the club 's executive director , Carl Pope . <p> ' I think the reason this is so divisive is because people like Carl Pope make it divisive , ' Elder said . ' Every time it comes up , he runs to the media crying racism . ' <p> Not coincidentally , Pope worked for Tanton and Lamm in the early 1970s during their separate terms as presidents of a group called Zero Population Growth , or ZPG . <p> Pope said the group stressed birth control and never took up anti-immigration as its mantra . Neither should the Sierra Club , he said , because the organization does not need the fringe racist and xenophobic characters that the anti-immigration movement has drawn . <p> Nonetheless , he said , members of the organization will be the ones to decide its future . <p> " I think it 's clear John Tanton is a nativist , " Pope said of the term used for those opposed to immigrants .
