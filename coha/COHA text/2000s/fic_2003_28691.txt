BOOK ONE Sunday in Central Park . A raw gusty September afternoon , unseasonably cold . Wind ripping the browning leaves from the oaks and plane trees . Autumn in the air . On this particular Sunday afternoon , middle of the 1990s , Gwendolen Lewis was sitting by the toy-boat pond , where she had arranged to meet a friend . Gwen , as was her habit , was early ; her friend late . She had ploughed through the remains of the Sunday papers ( no news ; just stupid weekend stories about how to spend your money ) ; she had made notes on the next morning 's business trip , picked up the messages on her voice mailone from Constance , warning , redundantly , that she was late . She had bolted a cup of coffee , and now was reduced to restless waiting . Glistening runners , spillover from the day 's marathon . Rollerbladers , colliding . Baby carriages with superstructures fanciful as Roman chariots , maneuvered by anxious parents . And dogs . Dogs sniffing , sparring , mounting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy with strangers whose only point of commonality was that their dog just happened to be licking your dog 's unprotesting asshole . Damned Sundays . Late Constance . Loathsome park , with its neutered geometries , intended to placate creaturesdogs , small children , athleteswho should n't be living in a city to begin with . Constance , an Englishwoman who lived in Singapore , was staying three blocks away at the Carlyle . So why could n't she and Gwen have met instead downstairs in the Bemelmans Bara dark , confessional place which did n't welcome animals , or grown men on skates ? Besides , it was aboutto pour . And here , twenty-two minutes past the appointed hour , came Constance . On the brow of the hill Gwen spotted her , and watched her de-scend through the crowd : long red-gold braid slapping one shoulder , schoolgirl-dishevelled in loose white corduroys , and something immeasurably provocative , derisive in the waggle of her bottom . A smiling obliviousness that declared , There are only twelve people in the universe I care about . . . Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hair , as if to obliterate the pity of their living eight thousand miles apart and only meeting three times a year . " Why 're you so late ? " Constance dropped beside her . " I made the mistake of calling the children . ( They 're staying with my parents . ) Ruby wanted me to read her Noddy . I told her , My love , for some odd reason I did n't bring any Noddy books to New York with me . ' She said , Here the book . Read it . ' Rather difficult to explain to a two-year-old an instrument that enables you to hear but not see . What would you likemore coffee ? " The two women bought cappuccinos from the kiosk and strolled counterclockwise around the pond . Paused by the statue of Alice in Wonderland , on whom Gwen and her younger brother had climbed as children . Twenty million years ago . Grown Gwen eyed bronze Alice , impresseddespite herselfby the poised girth of the pinafored giantess . A vertical sphinx , with eyes the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children hanging from her limbs , like the damned and the saved . " Shall we sit ? " Constance , evidently missing her own babies , wanting to watch other people 's children play . They sat . Next bench over , a bearded man was stretched out asleep , newspaper under his head . Homeless , or sleeping off a bender ? Sleeping , Gwen decided . You no longer saw so many homeless people in the city . Giuliani had shipped them all out to . . . to where ? To colonize some new Australia , maybe . " So you 're off to Russia tomorrow . I 'm glad I caught you . " Gwen , mid-sip , nodded . " Me , too . I miss you ; I do n't seem to have any friends anymore . I find myself talking to the computer . " " How 's work ? " " Hopping . " Gwen was a director of an institute set up to help the former Soviet Union democratize . " We just found out our Moscow accountanthired by me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you trace the money ? " " Oh , we 'll never get it back . The money 's not even the point . It'swhat do you expect , the whole society has been this kleptocracy for years . It 's no joke getting people to feel , This is your country now , you do n't need to rape your wife , you could try making love to her for a change . . . " " Do you still like it ? " " Russia ? My job ? Yeah , both of them . A lot . You know I 've got this taste for dead-end streets . How about you , Constance ? Are you getting used to the East ? Do n't you miss work ? " Constance was a lawyer who had specialized in mergers and acquisitions at a white-shoe London firm . For a few years she 'd appeared a highflyertill , burnt out on corporate hours , she had first shifted into human rights and then , after her second child , quit . " You must be joking . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather stay at home and gossip with the nannies . " She paused . " You know , Singapore 's hardly the East . Sadly . We live in international quarantine , like these sort of high-paid guest workersyou know how Singapore Chinese just despise everybody . But Roger swears we 'll be back in London in a year . . . " She leaned forward , narrow shoulders hunched against the wind . Smiling , with an unfocused benevolence , at the boys and girls swarming over Alice 's polished bestiary . " You 're homesick for your children . " Gwen , jealous . Constance , for reply , shifted her smile to her friend . " You do n't want babies ever , do you ? I mean , you think this mothery stuff is all unspeakably dreary and trivial , do n't you ? " Not accusingon the contrary , vicariously enjoying her friend 's lone freedom , her license to play the field . " The pleasures of small childrenof one 's own small childrenare somehow impossible to convey . " Gwen considered ( briefly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf people 's . The tedium of being expected to evince an interest in Noddy when all you wanted to do was read the paper , pay your bills . " I guess so . " Then , embarrassed , she launched into self-defense . " You know , I 'm away a lot . Places without phones or . . . FAA regulations . I mean , nobody with a family could possibly justify setting foot on one of these rattraps they 're flying out of . . . Murmansk . Sometimes I think if I could be the fatheryou know , just stop by once in a while to kiss the kid good night . . . " " But you 're happy . . . " " Oh , come on . Happiness suggests an absence of self-loathing I ca n't quite pretend to , but let 's say , I like my work . Then at the end of the day , I want to lock the door and be alone . Read a book , turn out the light whenever . There 's something about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you trying to brush your teeth when the other one 's pissing , that just makes me want to " " What about Campbell ? " " Campbell 's great , but . . . " " That sounds red-hot . " " What can I say ? I 'm an old maid . Am I going to wake up in ten , fifteen years , aghast that I forgot to have children ? Maybe . I do n't think that far ahead , I 'm not ruling anything out , maybe I 'll be that mother who orders her customized chick at seventy-three . " Not saying the obvious . That most of what she 'd seen of marriage was lies , betrayal , destruction . At best , the slow erosion of whatever you 'd once liked about yourself . " Could you imagine spending your life with him ? " " Who , Campbell ? I ca n't live with myself , let alone someone else . I mean , I guess that 's what I 'm sayingI 'm just scraping by , there 's not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbandshe 'd heard women her age pronounce this pompous phrase as if the guy thus conjured were seven feet tall , shaved with a straight razor , and had fucked them to jelly that very morning . When in fact most husbands Gwen knew were snot-nosed squirts , needy , repetitive , cavilling . My husband ? No . " How 's Roger doing ? " Grudgingly . The irredentism creeping in , willy-nilly : I shared a bed with your wife back when she wore braces on her teeth and had to listen to Blondie 's " Heart of Glass " five times before breakfast ; I possess unstudied archives of herage fifteen , seventeen , twenty-one , at the beach , shoplifting , on her first acid tripthat you would die for one peek at . When Constance was one of the few foreigners at a New England boarding school . An ugly duckling , all skinny legs and freckles . Like Gwen , a near-geek . " Roger ? He 's a wonder , " said Constance , ironically . " His bonuses are larger than the GNP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off work , too : I ca n't very well pretend we need the money . " " I bet , " said Gwen . " I remember when people used to go on about the eighties being this age of greed . " " Oh , the eighties were Hard Times compared to nowadays . " " This is the real thing , is n't it ? " The children swirling , swirling over Alice in Wonderland . Trampling the Dormouse , throttling the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat . The children swirling , swirling , spilling over the edges like besiegers of a fortress . On the bench next to Gwen and Constance 's , the sleeping man turned over in his sleep . Tucked his long legs tighter under his butt . He was wearing a pair of red Converse All Stars , Gwen noted , his big toe poking out of a hole in one sneaker . Gwen intercepted her friend 's unease : the danger-averting watchfulness of Constance-as-mother . What is this potential pervert doing here ? I thought they did n't allow unaccompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Singapore too long . . . Constance was n't the only one watching their sleeping neighbor , Gwen noticed . A boy in a Braves shirt , scaling Alice 's brawny shoulder , also kept glancing at the man . High wind ruffling the leaves on the plane trees underside up , the clouds now dark and heavy-lidded with their burden , and a first grumble of thunder . Gwen stood up . " We 'd better split . " The parents , too , beginning to hustle their kids , pack up the strollers , slip windbreakers from knapsacks . And nowas if everyone 's eyes had finally bored him awakethe sleeper on the next-door bench sat up , stretched . Looked around . Taking in Constance , Gwenwho looked away too late . The man yawned , stood up , glanced over at Alice . At the boy in the baseball shirt . " C'm on , " said the man to the boy . " Time to go home . " And Gwen watched as he chucked his newspaper into a trash can and ambled over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mounted , helped the boy onto its crossbar , and cycled away , wobbling . Leaving Gwen feeling obscurely excluded . Not quite sure which it was she enviedthe raffish ease of the cycler , or the trustfulness of the son nesting between those pedalling knees . She and Constance also rose , hurrying up the hill and out onto Fifth Avenue . The rain cascading now , surplusing in indented coveys in the octagonal paving . Lightning white-white in the sky 's sullen darkness . Gwen and Constance rushing across Madison Avenue in the pus-laden downpour , narrowly missed by a bus , splashing a group of people sheltering under the awning of the Carlyle . " Do you want to come up to my room for some tea ? Roger should be back any minute . " " I can'tI have to stop by the office . " " And tonight ? We 're supposed to meet Christopher at some new " " I know . Unfortunately , I 've been summoned for dinner with my dad . The triannual dinner . He only calls up when Jacey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I guess . " 2 The Lavrinsky Institute was housed in a turn-of-the-century Gothic palace on the southeast corner of Seventy-ninth and Fifth . Gwen had wondered if her boss , Edward Lavrinsky , had not seen his own face in one of those crouching limestone monkey-men that dripped from each corner . Lavrinsky was an investor who had decided to translate his fortune into political philanthropy . Gwen , who had met his children , did n't much blame him . In the late seventies and early eighties , Lavrinsky had funnelled money into the New York City public school system , of which he was a stellar graduate . But Lavrinsky had evidently been bored by education and its theoreticians : he was much more interested in shaping U.S. foreign policya job that in bolder days had been assumed by the U.S. government . With the end of the Cold War , Lavrinsky had founded an institute devoted to rehabilitating the former Soviet Union , whose southern reaches he himself had fled , long ago , as a small boy . Half a billion dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Belarus ; retraining biochemists in the warfare cities of Kazakhstan ; vaccinating children against tuberculosis ; reflooding the Aral Sea . Gwen was in charge of their Russian portfolio . It was a sweet racy job , just subversive enough to keep her happy . Every year , like a medieval bishop spreading Christianity , she launched a new program in Kazan or Stavropol or Arkhangel'sk ; every few months she came round to check on her older parishes , manned by missionaries with bank accounts . She was often followed ; their offices were bugged ; their local employees were sometimes arrested while the foreign nationals got their visas revoked . Besides which , she sometimes knew in the worst way that their larger enterprise was n't working , that Russia and its chickens were still a world apart . But it beat her previous job , working in the State Department . Today , Gwen stayed at the office till seven , clearing her plate for the next three weeks ' absence .                @ @ @ @ @
