1 The Latin term pro bono , as most attorneys will attest , roughly translated means for boneheads and applies to work done without charge . Not that I practice law , but I am usually smart enough to avoid having to donate my services . In this case , my client was in a coma , which made billing a trick . Of course , you might look at the situation from another point of view . Once in a while a piece of old business surfaces , some item on life 's agenda you thought you 'd dealt with years ago . Suddenly , it 's there again at the top of the page , competing for your attention despite the fact that you 're completely unprepared for it . First , there was a phone call from a stranger ; then a letter showed up fourteen years after it was sent . That 's how I learned I 'd made a serious error in judgment and ended up risking my life in my attempt to correct for it . I 'd just finished a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank account was fat and I was n't in the mood to take on additional work . I 'd pictured a bit of time off , maybe a trip some place cheap , where I could lounge in the sun and read the latest Elmore Leonard novel while sipping on a rum drink with a paper umbrella stuck in a piece of fruit . This is about the range and complexity of my fantasies these days . The call came at 8 A.M. Monday , May 19th , while I was off at the gym . I 'd started lifting weights again : Monday , Wednesday , and Friday mornings after my 6 A.M. run . I 'm not sure where the motivation came from after a two year lay-off , but it was probably related to thoughts of mortality , primarily my own . In the spring , I 'd sustained damage to my right hand when a fellow dislocated two fingers trying to persuade me to his point of view . I 'd been hurt once before when a bullet nicked my right arm and my impulse in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you imagine I 'm a masochist or accident-prone , I should state that I make a living as a private investigator . Truth be told , the average P.I . seldom carries a gun , is n't often pursued , and rarely sustains an injury more substantial than a paper cut . My own professional life tends to be as dull anyone else 's . I simply report the exceptions in the interest of spiritual enlightenment . Processing events helps me keep my head on straight . Those of you acquainted with my personal data can skip this paragraph . For the uninitiated , I 'm female , thirty-six years old , twice divorced , and living in Santa Teresa , California , which is ninety-five miles north of Los Angeles . Currently , I occupy one small office in the larger suite of offices of Kingman and Ives , attorneys at law . Lonnie Kingman is my attorney when the occasion arises , so my association with his firm seemed to make sense when I was looking for space . I 'd been rendered a migrant after I was unceremoniously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrongful death claims for California Fidelity Insurance . I 've been with Lonnie now for over two years , but I 'm not above harboring a petty desire for revenge on CFI . During the months I 'd been lifting weights , my muscle tone had improved and my strength had increased . That particular morning , I 'd worked my way through the customary body parts ; two sets , fifteen reps each , of leg extensions , leg curls , ab crunches , lower back , lat rows , the chest press and pec deck , along with the shoulder press , and various exercises for the biceps and triceps . Thus pumped up and euphoric , I let myself into my apartment with the usual glance at my answering machine . The message light was blinking . I dropped my gym bag on the floor , tossed my keys on the desk , and pressed the PLAY button , reaching for a pen and a pad of paper in case I needed to take notes . Before I leave the office each day , I have Lonnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , in a pinch , I can lie abed all day , dealing with the public without putting on my clothes . The voice was male , somewhat gravelly , and the message sounded like this : " Miss Millhone , this is Teddy Rich . I 'm calling from Olvidado about something might innerest you . This is eight A.M. Monday . Hope it 's not too early . Gim me a call when you can . Thanks . " He recited a telephone number in the 805 area code , and I dutifully jotted it down . It was only 8:23 so I had n't missed him by much . Olvidado is a town of 157,000 , 30 miles south of Santa Teresa on Highway 101 . Always one to be interested in something that might " innerest " me , I dialed the number he 'd left . The ringing went on so long I thought his machine would kick in , but the line was finally picked up by Mr. Rich , whose distinctive voice I recognized . " Hi , Mr. Rich . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your call . " " Hey , Miss Millhone . Nice to hear from you . How are you today ? " " Fine . How are you ? " " I 'm fine . Thanks for asking , and thanks for being so prompt . I appreciate that . " " Sure , no problem . What can I do for you ? " " Well , I 'm hoping this is something I can do for you , " he said . " I 'm a storage space scavenger . Are you familiar with the term ? " " I 'm afraid not . " I pulled the chair out and sat down , realizing Ted Rich was going to take his sweet time about this . I 'd already pegged him as a salesman or a huckster , someone thoroughly enamored of whatever minor charms he possessed . I did n't want what he was selling , but I decided I might as well hear him out . This business of storage space scavenging was a new one on me , and I gave him points for novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with details . Basically , I bid on the contents of self-storage lockers when the monthly payment 's in arrears . " " I did n't know they did that on delinquent accounts . Sounds reasonable , I suppose . " I took the towel from my gym bag and ruffed it across my head . My hair was still damp from the workout and I was getting chillier by the minute , longing to hit the shower before my muscles stiffened up . " Oh , sure . Storage unit 's been abandoned by its owner for more'n sixty days , the contents go up for auction . How else can the company recoup its losses ? Guys like me show up and blind bid on the contents , paying anywheres from two hundred to fifteen hundred bucks , hoping for a hit . " " As in what ? " I reached down , untied my Sauconys , and slipped them off my feet . My gym socks smelled atrocious and I 'd only worn them a week . " Well , most times you get junk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something good . Tools , furniture  --  stuff you can convert to hard cash . I 'm sure you 're pro'bly curious what this has to do with you . " " It crossed my mind , " I said mildly , anticipating his pitch . For mere pennies a day , you , too , can acquire abandoned bric-a-brac with which to clutter up your premises . " Yeah , right . Anyways , this past Saturday , I bid on a couple storage bins . Neither of ' em netted much , but in the process , I picked up a bunch of cardboard boxes . I was sorting through the contents and I came across your name on some personal documents . I 'm wondering what it 's worth to you to get ' em back . " " What kind of documents ? " " Lemme see here . Hold on . Frankly , I did n't expect to hear so soon or I 'd have had ' em on the desk in front of me . " I could hear him rattling papers in the background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelet and there 's quite a collection of school-type memorabilia : drawings , class pictures , report cards from Woodrow Wilson Elementary . This ringin ' any bells with you ? " " My name 's on these papers ? " Kinsey Millhone , right ? Millhone with two l 's . Here 's a history report , entitled ' San Juan Capistrano Mission , ' with a model of the mission made of egg cartons . Mrs. Rosen 's class , fourth grade . She gave you a D plus . ' Report is not bad , but project is poorly presented , ' she says . I had a teacher like her once . What a bitch , " he said , idly . " Oh , and here 's something else . Diploma says you graduated Santa Teresa High School June tenth , 1967 ? How 'm I doin ' so far ? " " Not bad . " " Well , there you go , " he said . " Not that it matters , but how 'd you track me down ? " " Piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The name Millhone 's unusual , so I figure it 's like the old saying goes ; apples do n't fall far from the tree and so forth . I proceeded on the assumption you were somewheres close . You could 've got married and changed your name , of course . I took a flier on that score . Anyways , the point is , how 'd you feel about gettin ' these things back ? " " I do n't understand how the stuff ended up in Olvidado . I 've never rented storage space down there . " I could hear him begin to hedge . " I never said Olvidado . Did I say that ? I go to these auctions all over the state . Lookit , I do n't mean to sound crass , but if you 're willing to pony up a few bucks , we can maybe make arrangements for you to get this box back . " I hesitated , annoyed by the clumsiness of his maneuvering . I remembered my struggle in Mrs. Rosen 's class , how crushed I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact was , I had so little in the way of personal keepsakes that any addition would be treasured . I did n't want to pay much , but neither was I willing to relinquish the items sight unseen . I said , " The papers ca n't be worth much since I was n't aware they were missing . " Already , I did n't like him and I had n't even met him yet . " Hey , I 'm not here to argue . I do n't intend to hose you or nothin ' like that . You want to talk value , we talk value . Up to you , " he said . " Why do n't I think about it and call you back ? " " Well , that 's just it . If we could find time to get together , you could take a look at these items and then come to a decision . How else you going to know if it 's worth anything to you ? It 'd mean a drive down here , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I suppose . " " Excellent , " he said . " So what 's your schedule like today ? " " Today ? " " No time like the present is my attitude . " " What 's the big hurry ? " " No hurry in particular except I got appointments set up for the rest of the week . I make money turnin ' stuff over and my garage is already packed . You have time today or not ? " " I could probably manage it . " " Good , then let 's meet as soon as possible and see if we can work somethin ' out . There 's a coffee shop down the street from me . I 'm on my way over now and I 'll be there for about an hour . Let 's say 9:30 , quarter to ten . You do n't show ? I got ta make a run to the dump anyways so it 's no skin off my nose . " " What 'd you have in mind ? " " Moneywise ? Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Exorbitant , " I said . I asked him for directions . What a hairball . I showered and flung on the usual blue jeans and T-shirt , then gassed up my VW and headed south on 101 . The drive to Olvidado took 25 minutes . Following Ted Rich 's instructions , I took the Olvidado Avenue exit and turned right at the bottom of the off-ramp . Half a block from the freeway , there was a large shopping mall . The surrounding land , originally given over to agricultural use , was gradually being converted to a crop of new and used cars . Lines of snapping plastic flags defined tent shapes above the asphalt lot where rows of vehicles glinted in the mild May sun . I could see a shark-shaped mini-blimp tethered and hovering thirty feet in the air . The significance escaped me , but what do I know about these things ? Across from the mall , the business establishments seemed to be equally divided among fast food joints , liquor stores , and instant copy shops that offered passport photos . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litigate while you wait . BANKRUPTCY $99 . DIVORCE $99 ... DIVORCE W/ KIDS $99 + FILING FEE . Se habla espaol . The coffee shop he 'd specified appeared to be the only mom-and-pop operation in the area . I parked my car in the lot and pushed into the place , scanning the few patrons for someone who fit his description . He 'd indicated he was six foot two and movie-star handsome , but then he 'd snorted with laughter , which led me to believe otherwise . He 'd said he 'd watch the door for my arrival . I spotted a guy , who raised a hand in greeting and beckoned me to his booth . His face was a big , ruddy square , his sunburn extending into the V of his open-collared denim work shirt . He wore his dark hair combed straight back and I could see the indentation at his temples where he 'd removed the baseball cap now sitting on the table next to him . He had a wide nose , drooping upper lids and bags under his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his morning shave . His shoulders were beefy and his forearms looked thick where he had his sleeves rolled up . He 'd removed a dark brown wind breaker that now lay neatly folded over the back of the booth . " Mr. Rich ? Kinsey Millhone . How are you ? " We shook hands across the table and I could tell he was sizing me up with the same attention to detail I 'd just lavished on him . " Make it Teddy . Not bad . I appreciate your coming . " He glanced at his watch as I slid in across from him . " Unfortunately I only got maybe fifteen , twenty minutes before I have to take off . I apologize for the squeeze , but right after we spoke , I hadda call from some guy down in Thousand Oaks needs an estimate on his roof . " " You 're a roofer ? " " By trade . " He reached in his pants pocket . " Lemme pass you my card in case you need somethin ' done . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business cards . " My speciality is new roofs and repairs . " " What else is there ? " " Hey , I can do anything you need . Hot mops , tear offs , torch downs , all types of shake , composition , slate , clay tile , you name it . Corrective and preventative is my area of expertise . I could give you a deal ... let 's say , ten percent off if you call this month . What kind of house you in ? " " Rented . " " So maybe you got a landlord needs some roof work done . Go ahead and keep that . Take as many as you want . " He offered me a handful of cards , fanned out face down like he was about to do a magic trick . I took one and examined it . The card bore his name , telephone number , and a post office box . His company was called Overhead Roofing , the letters forming a wide inverted V like ridge line of a roof . His company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Catchy , " I remarked . He 'd been watching for my reaction , his expression serious . " I just had those made . Came up with the name myself . Used to be Ted 's Roofs . You know , simple , basic , something of a personal touch . I could have said ' Rich Roofs , ' but that might have gave the wrong impression . I was in business ten years , but then the drought came along and the market dried up  --  " " So to speak , " I put in . He smiled , showing a small gap between his two front lower teeth . " Hey , that 's good . I like your sense of humor . You 'll appreciate this one . Couple years without rain and people start to take a roof for granite . Get it ? Granite ... like the rock ? " I said , " That 's funny . " " Anyways , I 've had a hell of a time . I hadda shut down altogether and file bankruptcy . My wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then my truck got sideswiped . I was screwed big time . Now we got some bad weather coming in , I figured I 'd start fresh . Overhead Roofing is a kind of play on words . " " Really , " I said . " What about the storage space business ? Where did that come from ? " " I figured I hadda do something when the roofing trade fell in . ' As it were , ' " he added with a wink at me . " I decided to try salvage . I had some cash tucked away the wife and the creditors did n't know about so I used that to get started . Takes five or six thousand if you want to do it right . I got hosed once or twice , but otherwise I been doing pretty good , even if I do say so myself " He caught the waitress 's attention and held his coffee cup in the air with a glance back at me . " Can I buy you a cup of coffee ? " " That sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " About a year , " he said . " We 're called ' pickers , ' or storage room gamblers , sometimes resellers , treasure hunters . How it works is I check the papers for auction listings . I also subscribe to a couple newsletters . You never know what you 'll find . Couple of weeks ago , I paid two-fifty and found a painting worth more than fifteen hundred bucks . I was jazzed . " " I can imagine . " " Of course , there 's rules to the practice , like anything else in life . You ca n't touch the rooms ' contents , ca n't go inside before the bidding starts , and there 's no refunds . You pay six hundred dollars and all you come up with is a stack of old magazines , then it 's too bad for you . Such is life and all that . " ' " Can you make a living at it ? " He shifted in his seat . " Not so 's you 'd notice . This is strictly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it does n't look good on paper so the wife ca n't hit me up for alimony . She was the one who walked out so up hers is what I say . " The waitress appeared at the table with a coffee pot in hand , refilling his cup and pouring one for me . Teddy and the waitress exchanged pleasantries . I took the moment to add milk to my coffee and then tore the corner off a pack of sugar , which I do n't ordinarily take . Anything to fill time till they finished their conversation . Frankly , I thought he had the hots for her . Once she departed , Teddy turned his attention to me . I could see the box on the seat beside him . He noticed my glance . " I can see you 're curious . Wan na peek ? " I said , " Sure . " I made a move toward the box and Teddy put a hand out , saying , " Gim me five bucks first . " Then he laughed . " You shoulda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm teasing . Help yourself . " He hefted the box and passed it across the table . It was maybe 36 inches square , awkward , but not heavy , the cardboard powdery with dust . The top had been sealed , but I could see where the packing tape had been cut and the flaps folded back together . I set the box on the seat beside me and pulled the flaps apart . The contents seemed hastily thrown together with no particular thought paid to the organization . It was rather like the last of the cartons packed in the moving process ; stuff you do n't dare throw out , but do n't really know what else to do with . A box like this could probably sit unopened in your basement for the next ten years , and nothing would ever stimulate a search for even one of the items . On the other hand , if you felt the need to inventory the contents , you 'd still feel too attached to the items to toss the assortment in the trash . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box to the other boxes on the van , gradually accumulating sufficient junk to fill a ... well , a storage bin . I could tell at a glance these were articles I wanted . In addition to the grade school souvenirs , I spotted the high school diploma he 'd mentioned , my year book , some textbooks , and more importantly , file after file of mimeographed pages from my classes at the police academy . Thirty bucks was nothing for this treasury of remembrances . Teddy was watching my face , trying to gauge the dollar signs in my reaction . I found myself avoiding eye contact lest he sense the extent of my interest . Stalling , I said , " Whose storage space was it ? I do n't believe you mentioned that . " " Guy named John Russell . He a friend of yours ? " " I would n't call him a friend , but I know him , " I said . " Actually , that 's an in-joke , like an alias . ' John Russell ' is a character in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to get ahold of him , but I did n't have much luck . Way too many Russells in this part of the state . Couple of dozen Johns , ten or fifteen Jacks , but none were him because I checked it out . " " You put some time in . " You bet . Took me couple hours before I gave it up and said nuts . I tried this whole area : Perdido , LA County , Orange , San Bernardino , Santa Teresa County , as far up as San Luis . There 's no sign of the guy , so I figure he 's dead or moved out of state . " I took a sip of my coffee , avoiding comment . The addition of milk and sugar made the coffee taste like a piece of hard candy . Teddy tilted his head at me with an air of bemusement . " So you 're a private detective ? I notice you 're listed as Millhone Investigations . " " That 's right . I was a cop for two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy 's a cop ? " " Not now , but he was in those days . " " I would n't have guessed that ... I mean , judging from the crap he had jammed in that space . I'dda said some kind of bum . That 's the impression I got . " " Some people would agree . " " But you 're not one of ' em , I take it . " I shrugged , saying nothing . Teddy studied , me shrewdly . " Who 's this guy to you ? " " What makes you ask ? " " Come on . What 's his real name ? Maybe I can track him down for you , like a missing persons case . " " Why bother ? We have n't spoken in years so he 's nothing to me . " " But now you got me curious . Why the alias ? " " He was a vice cop in the late sixties and early seventies . Big dope busts back then . John worked undercover so he was always paranoid about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maybe so , " I said . " What else was in the bin ? " He waved a hand dismissively . " Most of it was useless . Lawnmower , broken-down vacuum cleaner . There was a big box of kitchen stuff ; wooden rolling pin , big wooden salad bowl must have been three feet across the top , set of crockery bowls ... what do you call it ? That Fiesta Ware shit . I picked up a fair chunk of change for that . Ski equipment , tennis racquets ; none of it in prime condition . There was an old bicycle , motorcycle engine , wheel cover , and some car parts . I figure Russell was a pack rat , could n't let go of stuff . I sold most of it at the local swap meet , this was yesterday . " I felt my heart sink . The big wooden bowl had belonged to my Aunt Gin . I did n't care about the Fiesta Ware , though that was hers as well . I was wishing I 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gin had used it to make sticky buns ... one of her few domestic skills ... rolling out the dough before she sprinkled on the cinnamon and sugar . I had to let that one go ; no point in longing for what had already been disposed of . Odd to think an item would suddenly have such appeal when I had n't thought of it in years . He nodded at the box . " Thirty bucks and it 's yours . " " Twenty bucks . It 's barely worth that . It 's all junk . " " Twenty-five . Come on . For the trip down memory lane . Things like that you 're never going to see again . Sentimental journey and so forth . Might as well snap it up while you have the chance . " I removed a twenty from my handbag and laid it on the table . " Nobody else is going to pay you a dime . " Teddy , shrugged . " So I toss it . Who cares ? Twenty-five and that 's firm . " " Teddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts you five bucks ahead . " He stared at the money , flicked a look to my face , and then took the bill with an exaggerated sigh of disgust with himself . " Lucky I like you or I 'd be pissed as hell . " He folded the twenty lengthwise and tucked it in his pocket . " You never answered my question . " " Which one ? " " Who 's this guy to you . " " No one in particular . A friend once upon a time ... not that it 's any of your business . " " Oh , I see . I get it . Now , he 's ' a friend . ' Inneresting development . You musta been close to the guy if he ended up with your things . " " What makes you say that ? " He tapped his temple . " I got a logical mind . Analytical , right ? I bet I could be a peeper just like you . " " Gee , Teddy , sure . I do n't see why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's while I was in the middle of a move . My stuff must have gotten mixed up with his when he left Santa Teresa . By the way , which storage company ? " His expression turned crafty . " What makes you ask ? " He said , in a slightly mocking tone . " Because I 'm wondering if he 's still in the area somewhere . " Teddy shook his head , way ahead of me . " No go . Forget it . You 'd be wasting your time . I mean , look at this way . If the guy used a phony name , he prob'bly also faked his phone number and his home address . Why contact the company ? They wo n't tell you nothin ' . " " I 'll bet I could get the information . That 's what I do for a living these days . " " You and Dick Tracy . " " All I 'm asking is the name . " Teddy smiled . " How much 's it worth ? " " How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a little business . Twenty bucks . " " Do n't be silly . I 'm not going to pay you . That 's ridiculous . " " So make me an offer . I 'm a reasonable guy . " " Bullshit . " " All I 'm saying is you scratch my back and I 'll scratch yours . " " There ca n't be that many storage companies in the area . " " Fifteen hundred and eleven , if you take in the neighboring counties . For ten bucks , I 'll tell you which little town it 's in . " " No way . " " Come on . How else you going to find out ? " " I 'm sure I can think of something . " " Wan na bet ? Five says you ca n't . " I glanced at my watch and slid out of the seat . " I wish I could chat , Teddy , but you have that appointment and I have to get to work . " " Why n't you call me if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could form us a partnership . I bet you could use a guy with my connections . " " No doubt . " I picked up the cardboard box , made a few more polite mouth noises , and returned to my car . I placed the box in the passenger seat and then slid in on the driver 's side . I locked both doors instinctively and blew out a big breath . My heart was thumping and I could feel the damp of perspiration in the small of my back . " John Russell " was the alias for a former Santa Teresa vice detective named Mickey Magruder ... my first ex-husband . What the hell was going on ?
