BOAT THIEF // A person gazing out across Charleston Harbor in the predawn quiet of May 13 , 1862 , would probably have found it hard to believe that the Civil War had begun at this very spot only a year before , with the thunderous shelling of the federal garrison at Fort Sumter . Certainly the signs of war remained , most noticeably the rebel cannon that guarded the harbor and pointed seaward from numerous shore ramparts , their sights fixed on the ships of the Union blockade positioned three miles offshore . But all was now perfectly still , and the only discernible movement took place aboard the Planter , a small Confederate transport that appeared to be preparing to depart . // Hours before , the Planter ' s white captain , C. J. Relyea , and his officers had gone ashore for the night , leaving the vessel in the hands of its mulatto pilot , Robert Smalls , and creating the very opportunity that Smalls and his fellow slave crewmen had been waiting for . Having discussed in detail their plan to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they stealthily began their chores between 1 and 3 A.M. , maneuvering the Planter to a nearby pier to pick up Smalls 's wife and two children as well as four other black women , a child , and three other men . Because the punishment for what they were about to do would surely be death , Smalls had told the others that if caught , they would not surrender but would destroy the boat , along with themselves and all the Confederate guns and ammunition it carried . Two of the crewmen had heard Smalls 's warning and elected to stay behind , disembarking as the new passengers came aboard . At about 3 A.M. final farewells were whispered and the Planter eased back from the pier . // Despite the hour and the darkness , the city defenses were on alert against Union raiding or reconnaissance parties . Charleston , known for its cultured antebellum society and its leadership in the Southern secessionist movement , formed the emotional and political heart of the Confederacy ; it was also a strategic Atlantic port , and its defenders knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war 's first action , dreamed of recapturing it . To escape the harbor , the Planter would have to pass directly under the guns of several formidable batteries , including those of Fort Sumter itself , which was now in Confederate hands . The fort , set strategically in the middle of the harbor 's entrance , was a manmade island , a pentagon-shaped fortress with walls sixty feet high and six feet thick and guns protruding from all sides , emanating " an aura of doom and menace . " // As the Planter moved toward the gauntlet , some on board suggested racing past the rebel installations , but Smalls reminded them that such a panicky move would likely be fatal : their best and only hope was to pretend nothing was out of the ordinary . He was banking on the likelihood that sleepy rebel watchmen would not be suspicious of a work ship nosing its way out of the harbor before dawn , nor would they be inclined to imagine that slaves were stealing it . // With this audacious act , Robert Smalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by his white masters - first as a favored house servant , then as a semi-independent laborer and skilled sailor . Born on the South Carolina Sea Islands in April 1839 , he was the son of Lydia , a slave woman , and either the Charleston merchant Moses Goldsmith or John McKee , who was Lydia 's master . As a girl , Lydia lived and worked on a McKee plantation on Ladies Island , adjacent to the Sea Island town of Beaufort . Because of the dread fear of malaria , the wealthy planters of Beaufort visited their landholdings on the nearby islands only occasionally . One Christmas , when Mr. and Mrs. McKee toured the plantation , distributing oranges and other small gifts to the slaves , Lydia was precocious enough to compliment her mistress on the dress she was wearing . Mrs. McKee , charmed by the youngster 's remark , asked her age . " I was born the year George Washington got president , " Lydia replied . When John McKee next returned to the plantation , he asked after " the little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him back to Beaufort to serve as a housemaid . // Beaufort was the capital of Port Royal Island , which , with the nearby islands of Ladies and St. Helena 's , held a prominent position in the lush coastal region Carolinians call the low country . With its endless bays , rivers , tidal estuaries , and broad wetlands , its vast open distances , swarms of shore birds and marsh cranes , and the ancient live oak trees whose " fingers " almost scraped the ground , it seemed a faraway , otherworldly place . In the seventeenth century it had become a rice-growing mecca after the planters selectively imported West African slaves who had knowledge of rice cultivation ; these slaves introduced the complex methods of irrigation , seeding , and flood control that made the Carolina rice plantations profitable . By 1860 , the South was exporting 182 million pounds of rice per year , two thirds of it from South Carolina , and the crop 's success had helped make both Beaufort and Charleston prosperous towns , with grand white-columned mansions , high-steepled churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Smalls grew up in the McKee household , childhood playmate to his master , Henry McKee , who was likely his half brother , while his mother , Lydia , served the McKee family . So comfortable was the arrangement that after several years Lydia began to worry that her bright , energetic son might come to difficulty in the town someday by failing to understand his true status . To forestall such a problem , she took the unusual step of forcing Robert to watch the slave auctions and whippings at the arsenal building on Beaufort 's Craven Street , reminding him that only good fortune kept him from sharing the fate of the wretched people he saw there . Her strategy was not , however , entirely successful , for at age twelve Robert was caught defying the local slave curfew and soon after told his mother that he had listened with interest as another slave read a passage from a book by the abolitionist Frederick Douglass - the kind of proscribed acts she feared could get him cast out of the McKees ' Beaufort house to toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina rice plantations by no means presented the worst work conditions . Because the owners relied greatly on African ingenuity , the slaves had managed to negotiate somewhat more favorable work conditions than prevailed elsewhere in the South . Rather than labor from sunup to sundown , they were expected each day to execute assigned tasks ; once they had completed them , they were free to hunt , fish , or cultivate their own crops . Still , work in the fields was strenuous ; slaves labored long hours in knee-deep water , and there was an ever-present danger of snakes , insects , and malaria - the very risks that kept the white planters on Beaufort 's higher ground . Lydia wished to spare Robert from such a fate and finally appealed to the McKees to send her rambunctious son to Charleston , where the family maintained another home and where she believed Robert 's insubordinate streak would be less apparent . // In contrast to Beaufort , Charleston was a metropolis , a place of hubbub , splendor , and riches . Carriages with liveried servants traversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansions and hotels . Gentlemen strolled the Battery , talking politics and business , as ladies in crinoline window-shopped along fashionable King Street . Beyond the busy central market , with its fish stalls , vegetables , spices , and colorful rows of textiles , hundreds of large-masted ships lined the waterfront , taking on pallets of rice , tobacco , and other foreign-going cargo . // The city ran on the energy of thousands of slaves like Robert Smalls , as well as a substantial community of free blacks , many of whom were small tradesmen or skilled artisans such as roofers or carpenters . Even free blacks , however , were made to wear identity tags and have a white " guardian , " for the ongoing political agitation over slavery in the 1840s and 1850s had made local whites jittery . South Carolina , and Charleston in particular , had experienced at least two significant slave rebellions - the Stono Rebellion of 1739 , which broke out only twenty miles from the city , and the aborted Denmark Vesey uprising of 1822 . In the Stono disturbance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and killed two dozen whites before encountering the militia , which slaughtered them and placed their severed heads on posts by the roadside . In response to the affair , the colonial legislature enacted the Negro Act of 1740 , severely restricting slave behavior and mobility . The Vesey rebellion , planned for July 14 , Bastille Day , 1822 , was the brainchild of a fifty-five-year-old carpenter , Denmark Vesey , a former slave who had purchased his own freedom . Before Vesey could strike , however , two house slaves alerted the authorities , and he , along with several comrades , was arrested and put to death . The threat of slaves ' being fired to revolt by conspiracies led by free Negroes remained very real in the minds of white Carolinians , perhaps because after 1820 blacks began to outnumber whites in the state , and free blacks , because of their greater worldliness , were believed to be more likely to stir the embers of discontent . // Although slave-control measures were carefully observed in Charleston as secession and war loomed , Robert Smalls managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He arranged with the McKees to hire himself out as a day laborer and later as a town lamplighter , paying fifteen dollars a month to his owner . In 1856 , at age seventeen , he married a thirty-one-year-old slave named Hannah Jones , who worked as a hotel maid . From his modest earnings , Smalls began saving to buy his own and his wife 's freedom , as well as that of their daughter , Elizabeth , who was born in 1858 . His fortunes brightened considerably when he attained work in the town 's maritime trades . From his boyhood in coastal Beaufort he was already familiar with boats and their operation , and he proved a quick study , learning the myriad channels , currents , and shoals of Charleston Harbor . John Simmons , a white rigger and sail maker who took a liking to the young man , mentored him in shipboard work and navigation , and by 1861 Smalls was the wheelman ( blacks were not allowed to hold the title of pilot ) aboard the Planter , a cotton-hauling steamer plying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One hundred fifty feet in length and able to carry fourteen hundred bales , it was , because of its four-foot draft , ideal for maneuvering in the shallow coastal waterways . When war broke out , the boat was quickly commissioned by the Confederacy . Guns were installed on its foredeck and afterdeck , and it was immediately put to use ferrying troops , laying mines , and servicing the work crews building the harbor 's fortifications . // Smalls 's travels at the helm of the Planter frequently brought him into the vicinity of his old home at Beaufort , although after fall 1861 no Confederate vessel could approach the place . On November 7 , Union naval forces seeking a Southern anchorage for their blockade had bombarded and then invaded the Sea Islands , one of the first portions of the Confederacy to be conquered by federal troops . The South chose not to defend the outlying region , and local plantation owners fled the arriving Union forces , leaving behind their crops , stately homes , and as many as ten thousand slaves . // The Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the area became another kind of beachhead the following spring , with the arrival of two shiploads of Northern abolitionists . These missionaries , men and women from Boston , Philadelphia , and New York , perceived in the abandonment of the blacks of the coastal islands an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate that , with the proper guidance , former slaves could exercise the virtues of citizenship and free labor . " The Port Royal Experiment , " as it became known , was meant to prove the adaptability of free blacks , their eagerness to be educated , and their viability as wage laborers , so as to ease Northern concerns about emancipation . The endeavor proved more complex than anticipated . Though the departed slaveholders were not missed , their sudden exit was wrenching to the social hierarchy of the islands and raised difficult questions : how to restart the islands ' agricultural economy , bring in crops , open schools , and decide whether the former slaves would own land or what civil rights they might enjoy . Indeed , events in the Sea Islands had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own policy toward slaves liberated from their masters by advancing Union armies : were the slaves to be regarded as other people 's property or as free human beings ? // If federal authorities continued to wrestle with such matters , there was for Robert Smalls little confusion . It had been no secret to him , or most other slaves , that the victory of Abraham Lincoln in the election of 1860 , and the outbreak of war itself , held the definite potential for freedom . Looking out on clear evenings from the pilothouse of the Planter , Smalls could see the lights of Beaufort and marvel at the fact that his mother and other relations and friends there were already free . // By spring 1862 , with the federal lines so close , Smalls and the other slaves on the Planter began talking of crossing over , perhaps using the boat itself as a means of deliverance . Any slave caught plotting such an act , let alone carrying it out , would be killed , and Smalls understood that neither his connections to a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship 's pilot would save him . But he agreed with his mates to discuss the notion further and to watch for an opportunity to escape . // ( Continues ... ) //
