I sank into the black leather sofa in my father 's spacious office , leaning against a pillow that looked like a big , silky Chiclet . Tension rippled through the room . I glanced up at my dad , who was slumped forward in his chair , elbows on his leather-topped desk , forehead in one hand . His face was six inches from the speakerphone  --  a boxy thing , separate from the telephone , that sounded even worse than they do today . Wedged between the fingers of his other hand was a number-two pencil that he nervously wiggled back and forth . The voice coming out of the phone belonged to Ensign Hector Camacho , a representative from the Coast Guard . " I 'm very sorry , sir , " Camacho said with professional dispassion . My dad winced as if he 'd stepped on a thumbtack . " You 're saying he could have gone down anywhere within a hundred-mile radius ? " " I 'm saying that  --  " " Ca n't you find that plane ? You can not fathom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweat glistened on my father 's upper lip . " Try to calm down , Dr. Barnett , " Camacho said . " I know how difficult this must be for you , losing , uh , Mr. Greer . " " Henry ! " Dad shouted , and then , as if in an afterthought , he said , " Oh , God ... Henry . " I knew Henry Greer was the pilot and courier my father had sent to France to retrieve a page of Leonardo da Vinci 's notes . " Was he a relation ? " Camacho asked . My father ignored the question . " So there 's no way at all to recover this airplane ? " " He went down in very deep waters , and probably at high speed , sir . " My father snapped the yellow pencil and threw the two halves on the floor . " Jesus ! " I squirmed in my seat and thought maybe I should take a walk . But I stayed . " I know , " Camacho said . " I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a full minute before I realized that he was crying . That got me , and I felt tears welling up , too . Out of the little box , Camacho 's voice said , " Mister ... um , Doctor ? " " You 'll call me if anything turns up ? " Dad said desperately . " Anything . A piece of paper . A scrap of paper . " " Of course , sir . " " A document of any kind . Anything with writing on it . " " We 'll call you immediately if anything at all is recovered , sir . " My dad collected himself . " Thank you , Ensign , " he said . " Goodbye . " " Goodbye , sir , " Camacho said , and disconnected . My father stared at the dead speakerphone . I got up and walked over behind him , my boot heels silent on the thick maroon carpet . When I placed a hand on his shoulder , I realized his shirt was damp from sweat . " Dad ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me through watery eyes . " It 's gone , son , " he whispered . " It 's gone . " On July nights the humidity in Georgetown was so thick it looked as if a plastic shower curtain had been hung in front of the moon . Sometimes , after my mom and dad had kissed me good night and closed my door , I 'd get out of bed and kneel down in front of my second-story window , open it up , and poke my head out into the night . I 'd squint up at the hazy yellow face of the moon and feel the air-conditioning going one way and the hot , sticky air going the other , until I 'd start to sweat or a mosquito would nail me . The night of the plane crash I lay on my back in bed , propped up on my elbows . My mother leaned over me , dressed in her light blue cotton robe , scrubbed clean , no makeup . I breathed in the scent of her favorite soap  --  apricot from Caswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched Mom 's eyes as she fluffed my pillow . Her eyes are the color of acorns , I thought . The serenity they normally radiated was absent that night . And my sheets were tucked in too tightly . I pried them loose with my toes . " You did the wash today , huh . " " Nothing like fresh sheets , is there ? " Mom said , managing a smile . " Okay , there we go . You can cozy up now . " There was no chance of that happening . I laid my head back and my mother pulled the covers under my chin . " Is Dad coming up to give me a kiss ? " She sighed . " I do n't think so , sweetie . I do n't know when he 's coming up . He 's ... you know , he 's pretty upset . " She covered her mouth with her hand . If she cried I 'd have a nightmare for sure . " But it was an accident , " I said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ... " She sat down on the edge of the bed and placed her hand on my chest . I wanted to hold it , but my arms were stuck at my sides like a mummy 's . " Dad feels responsible , " she said . " If he had n't bought the notes for the museum , or if he 'd gone to get them himself , instead of sending the courier ... He 's really ... upset . " " Is he going to feel better tomorrow ? What about the museum party ? Are we still going to have the party ? We 're not , are we ? " Just the low hum of the air conditioner . " Maybe now nobody 'll ever find the Medici Dagger . " I sighed . " What would Leonardo think of that ? " " It was a tragedy today . For a lot of people . " " I could have helped . I could have done something . " " Honey , you 're eleven . There was nothing you could have done . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " She kissed my cheek and gave my earlobe a little tug . " Have swell dreams and a peach , " she whispered in my ear . " Swell dreams and a peach . " " Big peach , " I said , taking a last whiff of her . " Oh , Mom ... " " I know . The night-light . " She stopped by the door , clicked on the little light , and turned off the overhead . " Happy dancing shadows ... " she began . " ... in Reb 's sleep-tight light , " I murmured , finishing our little ritual . She padded down the hall , creaking the old floor in all the usual spots . Everything 's going to be all right . Everything 's going to be all right . I wish I could have done something  --  flown the plane maybe . Everything 's going to be all right . Everything . I was dreaming about twigs crackling in a campfire when my mother 's scream woke me . I bolted up in bed and looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A second scream shook me out of my dream state . I smelled smoke and realized the light was from a real fire creeping up the outside of our wooden house . " Mom ! Dad ! " I shouted as a window exploded somewhere downstairs . Smoke billowed up from under my door like a ghost coming to get me . I jumped out of bed ; the rug felt oddly warm under my bare feet . Running to the window , I threw it open and punched the screen out . All around me flames licked the house . Looking up , I saw the shake-roof shingles burning , shooting cinders like a million fireflies into the night sky . The whine of fire engines pierced the roar of the blaze , and I heard my mother scream my name from somewhere deep in the house . " Mom ! " I yelled as I crawled backward , feet-first , out the window . I hung on to the sill with an iron grip , looking into my room , waiting for something  --  I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held on tight . Just as the first fire truck came racing down our narrow street , my bedroom door burst open and I saw Mom standing in the doorway , flames all around her . Our eyes met and she shrieked , " Reb ! Jump ! " Her nightgown was on fire . Men 's voices shouted at me from down below  --  echoes from a distant canyon . As my mother threw her arms out and took two steps toward me , the house shuddered and the roof collapsed , with a sound like a thousand bones breaking , crushing her into eternity . I froze for a second , suspended in a place where the claws of horror could n't touch me . Then , scrambling my feet up the clapboard siding , a dozen splinters piercing my soles , I pushed off the wall and turned in midair , arcing over the walkway , going into a dive , reaching for the ground . I heard yelling as I hit the small patch of grass by the big elm near the curb and rolled smack up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't remember the name of the doctor who told me my parents had died in the fire . I know it was a man , though , because the voice was deep and had come from somewhere above little gold sea horses that floated in an ocean of royal blue tie . " Can you look at me , son ? " he asked . I gazed at the strange , curly-tailed creatures , envying their silken inanimateness . " I am looking at you , " I replied flatly . He cupped my face in his cold hands , swallowed audibly , and said again , softly , almost crying , " Can you look at me , son ? " I realized that he was probably thinking of his own kids . I felt sorry for him , having to be the one to tell me . I could n't look at him , though . I just let him deliver the news while I mingled with the sea horses . It was n't really news . I 'm nobody 's son , I thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
