Chapter One Flood I was fourteen when the lagoon spilled again . It was up in the mountains , at the far edges of our district . Like everything beautiful around here , no one had ever seen it . There was no rain , only thick clouds to announce the coming flood . Then the water came running down the avenue , pavement glistening , taking trash and rock and mud with it through the city and toward the sea . It was the first flood since Lucas had been sent to the University , a year into a five-year bid for assault . The neighborhood went dark and we ran to the avenue to see it : a kind of miracle , a ribbon of gleaming water where the street should have been . A few old cars were lined up , their headlights shining . Street mutts raced around us , barking frantically at the water and the people and the circus of it . Everyone was out , even the gangsters , everyone barefoot and shirtless , moving earth with their hands , forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Across the avenue those kids from Siglo XX stared at us like they wanted something . They worked on their street and we worked on ours . " Watch them , " Renan said . He was my best friend , Lucas 's younger brother . Over in Siglo XX they still had light . I could taste howmuch I hated them , like blood in my mouth . I would 've liked to burn their whole neighborhood down . They had no respect for us without Lucas . They 'd beat you with sticks and pipes . They 'd shove sand in your mouth and make you sing the national anthem . The week before , Siglo XX had caught Renan waiting for a bus on the wrong side of the street . They 'd taken his ball cap and his kicks , left his eye purple and swollen enough to squint through . Buses grunted up the hill against the tide , honking violently . The men moved wooden boards and armloads of bricks and sandbags , but the water kept coming . Our power came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope toward the city . Everyone stopped for a moment and listened to the humming water . The oily skin of the avenue shone orange , and someone raised a cheer . In the half-light , Renan said he saw one of the kids that got him . He had just the one good eye to see through . " Are you sure ? " I asked . They were just silhouettes . The flood lapped at our ankles , and the work was fierce . Renan was gritting his teeth . He had a rock in his hand . " Hold it , " he said . I felt its weight and passed it to Chocho . We all agreed it was a good rock . Renan threw it high over the avenue . We watched it disappear , Renan whistling the sinking sound of a bomb falling from the sky . We laughed and did n't see it land . Then Siglo XX tore across the avenue , a half dozen of them . They were badass kids . They went straight for our dike and wrecked it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating them , then the gangsters too . Arms flailed in the dim lights , Siglo XX struggling to break free . Then their whole neighborhood came and then ours and we fell into the thick fight of it , that inexplicable rush , that drug . We spilled onto the avenue and fought like men , side by side with our fathers and our brothers against their fathers and their brothers . It was a carnival . My hands moved in closed fists and I was in awe of them . I pounded a kid while Chocho held him down . Renan swung his arms like helicopter blades , grinning the whole time , manic . We took some hits and gave some and swore inside we lived for this . If Lucas could have seen us ! The water spilled over our broken dike but we did n't care . We could n't care . We were blind with happiness . We called it the University because it 's where you went when you finished high school . There were two kinds of prisoners there : terrorists and delinquents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They gathered in the yard each morning and did military stretches . They sang war songs all day and heckled the young guards . The war was more than ten years old . When news came of a successful attack somewhere in the city , they celebrated . Lucas was more of a delinquent and so behaved in ways that were easier to comprehend . A kid from Siglo XX caught a bad one and someone said they saw Lucas running across the avenue back to our street . That was enough for five years . He had n't even killed anyone . They lightened his sentence since he 'd been in the army . Before he went in , he made us promise we 'd join up when we were old enough . " Best thing I ever did , " he said . We spoke idly of things we 'd do when he got out , but our street was empty without him . People called us Diablos Jr . because we were just kids . Without Lucas , the gangsters hardly acknowledged us , except to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ...
