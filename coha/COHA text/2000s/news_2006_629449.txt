<p> After months of rumors , whispers and projections , the University Interscholastic League threw only a couple of curveballs at area high schools during its biennial realignment . <p> In fact , most of the area coaches were quite pleased with the UIL 's reshuffling of districts on Feb. 2 . <p> " I think the UIL did a good job of geographically coordinating the schools , " said Sterling head football coach Herb Minyard . <p> Lee head football coach Dick Olin agreed with Minyard . <p> " You never really know what is going to happen , " said Olin , who has been through realignment a time or two . " But there were very few major changes . Sometimes , that is a good thing . " <p> Good riddance <p> Lee and Sterling were cast into District 21 with Beaumont West Brook , Channelview , Port Arthur Memorial , Humble , Kingwood and brand new high school Atasocita , which opens its doors for the first time in the middle of August . Channelview and Atascocita took the place of Spring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four Klein schools and Tomball . <p> Spring and Westfield have dominated just about every sport since joining District 22-5A at the start of the 2004-2005 school year . <p> " Spring and Westfield going the other direction did not break my heart , " said Minyard with a laugh . <p> It did n't hurt Olin 's feelings , either . <p> " We were disappointed , " a sarcastic it to be an extremely competitive district . <p> " We did lose Westfield and Spring , " Minyard said , " but we still have to go out and compete every Friday night and take care of business . " <p> New opportunities <p> Still , both coaches know that without the two bullies on the block , they could have a better chance to make the Class 5A state playoffs . <p> " In the current situation with the schools there , we do have a chance to be competitive , " Minyard admitted . " Spring and Westfield pretty much dominated in everything . " <p> " The Spring schools are going to win whatever district they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , the travel aspect for them will be much better . People do n't realize how much that costs .. " <p> Channelview athletic director William Jennings is anxious to see what his Falcons can do at the Class 5A level . Channelview , which has been competing in District 23-4A , was bumped up to 5A after turning in an enrollment of 2,104 . The cutoff for 4A schools was 1,984 . <p> " We knew for us not to be moved up to the 5A level they would have to increase the 5A cutoff point , " Jennings said , " but I still think we will be able to compete . In some areas , we will have to improve , but I think we will be able to compete . " <p> The Falcons could struggle in football , however . <p> " Football is a concern , " admitted Jennings , who has watched the Falcons finish near the bottom of the 23-4A standings almost every year for the past four seasons . " But we are not going to bellyache or cry about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with La Marque , Texas City and Friendswood ) for years . In 5A , we are just going to play against more Division I players . " <p> Jennings said he figured Channelview would wind up with the Humble and Baytown schools . <p> " With Atascocita coming on line , I figured we could be in this district , " he said . " I am not surprised at all by this . " <p> Neither was Minyard . <p> " This makes sense , " he said . " Channelview is a perfect fit . " <p> Welcome to 4A <p> A couple of area 3A schools , meanwhile , have been bumped up to compete at the 4A level because of their increasing enrollment . <p> Barbers Hill , which has an enrollment of 963 , and Huffman , which has more than 1,000 students , now will compete against Crosby , Galena Park , Forest Brook , C.E. King , Smiley and New Caney in the new eight-team District 21-4A . <p> The Eagles and Falcons have dominated the District 23-3A football race for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump ( up to 4A ) , " said Barbers Hill head football coach/athletic director Don Price . " In October , we had to count nine Katrina ( evacuee ) kids ( from New Orleans ) . That put us up to 963 . The cutoff ( for 3A ) was 949 . <p> " But we are excited about the challenge of playing at the Class 4A level , " said Price , who has watched his team pretty much have its way at the 3A level . " It is one of those things you can either get excited about or worry about . " <p> Price said it should be a competitive district . <p> " I am a little surprised by the configuration , " he said . " I thought we would be the one to go to the Beaumont area and Dayton would stay there . That was the only surprise there . " <p> Status quo satisfies <p> District 23-5A turned into District 22-5A , but the league 's eight members - Deer Park , North Shore , La Porte , Pasadena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - remained exactly the same . And that was just fine with Deer Park head coach Chris Massey . <p> " I was pleased with it , " Massey said . " I am glad I was n't having to scramble for ( non-district ) games . " <p> Sam Rayburn head coach Mike Woodley would have preferred a change of scenery . <p> " First of all , I think it is a really good district as it is , " Woodley said . " But , honestly , I was hoping to get a little different change . We lost Pearland two years ago and picked up the new school ( Pasadena Memorial ) . It was a good trade-off at the time . I thought they might bring in Channelview . They are right along I-10 there . <p> " I am trying to be positive about this , but we have two giant schools in this district in North Shore and Deer Park . They have close to 4,000 students . Dobie also is over 3,000 , and the same with Memorial . Meanwhile , us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How is a school with 2,100 going to compete against a school with 4,000 kids on a consistent basis ? " <p> Massey said competing against North Shore is a challenge . <p> " If you are going to be one of those teams , you have to beat them , " he said . " I think you ca n't avoid people like that . Obviously , they are good , but there have been other people figure out how to beat them at some point in time . I certainly hope we are capable of competing with those people . " <p> Playoff rule riles <p> Massey and Woodley both did n't like the UIL 's decision to increase the playoff field from three teams to four in each Class 5A district . <p> " I am not a big fan of that , " Massey said . " Four teams waters it down too much . Even with three teams you have teams with losing records make the playoffs . But that is just my opinion . I also favor having just one state champion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't understand that , " Woodley said . " I think they should go back to two . Four is way too much .
