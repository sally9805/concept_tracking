Just this month the permanent display of the arts of pre-revolutionary New England in the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has been greatly enriched by a selection of treasures from the Ann and Philip Holzer Collection . Seven objects  --  three pieces of Newport furniture , two pieces of needlework , and a pair of Copley portraits-have been promised to the museum , and will be given over time . Meanwhile , the objects will be displayed together in an alcove of the American Wing in close proximity to related pieces in the museum 's collection . The story behind these various relationships - between objects and between the collectors and the curators-is told in this article . Ann and Philip Holzer passionately collected eighteenth-century American decorative arts for more than twenty-five years . Ann Holzer 's small general-interest antiques shop piqued her husband 's interest . In 1972 , at auction , he purchased his first piece of American furniture , a Connecticut cherry Chippendale table . Thereafter , as he recalls , they " Looked , learned , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Newport , Rhode Island , recognizing it as a truly American idiom . About 1987 they added a wing to their house specifically for the collection , and in 1990 , for the interest and pleasure of their family and friends , they published a catalogue with sixty-three entries . Three years later they issued a supplement with sixteen additional objects.1 In the introduction to the catalogue , the Holzers wrote : Forming the collection over these many years had been a great exercise in intellectual curiosity , exciting search , and eduring pleasure . It hae been a very significant part of our lives and it now seeme appropriate that we make some record of what has been so important to us . After his wife 's death in 1999 , Philip Holzer moved from their house on Long Island to an apartment in New York City , and began to wonder whether there was not some permanent and useful way to memorialize the pleasure he and his wife had taken in the pursuit of the best craftsmanship of colonial America . He was proud of their collection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned the objects . The Holzers had already given some things to the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven , Connecticut , especially American silver , but the Metropolitan was their " local " museum , and Ann Holzer had long talked about wanting to have things there .

I knew him only by name , but he knew the American Wing intimately , particularly its superb collection of Newport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Rhode Island craftsmen came up , and when I made my first visit to his apartment I found that virtually all the furniture was from Newport . There was a three-tier basin stand ( Pl . III ) of truly outstanding quality , which I had marveled at back in 1980 at the famous sale at Pokety Farms , Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch 's estate on Maryland 's Eastern Shore . And , talk about Newport furniture , there was the great drop-leaf dining table of 1756 ( PI . I ) , signed and dated by John Townsend , which I had lusted after when , also in 1980 , it came up at auction in New York But if it were to claim to illustrate the full range of Newport genius , the museum still had egregious lacunae . Major furniture forms like drop-leaf dining tables were not represented , nor indeed was there a single piece with cabriole legs and claw-and-ball feet by John Townsend for comparison with our great card table by John Goddard ( 17231785 ) , Townsend 's cousin , near contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fills both of these bills to perfection .

Now , the Holzer basin stand offers perhaps the most ambitious version of the form . ( The stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Winterthur , Delaware , are the only ones known . ) The top rim held the basin ; the middle disk with three cutouts held soap dishes ; and the lower disk , dished out in the center , held the water bottle . Pieces of this type are often associated with the work of John Goddard . The side chair ( Pl . II ) was selected from among a number of Queen Anne style examples in the Holzer Collection first for its overall quality and condition and second because of its especial resonance with another chair in the museum 's collection . The latter ( Fig. 1 ) , a slightly later version , is similar except that it has a trapezoidal seat and carved knees . These chairs are among a very few chair models that today can unequivocally be assigned to Newport . Both have claw-and-ball feet in the manner associated with John Goddard . Much to the delight of those of us in the American Wing , Mr. Holzer has given us two pieces of eighteenth-century needlework of great interest . The first is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Anne Chase of Newport . Stitched with colorful silk threads on a wool ground , primarily in cross-stitch , it features an acorn and carnation border , three wide floral bands , and a verse . The fact that it is unfinished actually adds to its appeal , for it teaches us how sampler patterns were laid out , and the process by which the girls of Newport worked their samplers . According to the sampler scholar and collector Betty Ring , Anne Chases sampler is the earliest known example of a Newport group of the first half of the eighteenth century.2 Upon entering the collection , it will be our earliest American sampler , predating an Adam and Eve example from Boston by eighteen years . There is only one other Newport sampler in the American Wing 's collection , dated 1795 , which is , unfortunately in quite poor condition , and can not be displayed because of many large holes in the ground fabric . So the Holzer piece is doubly appreciated : It is our only American sampler from the 1720s , and only exhibitable sampler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Newport , 1758 . Inscribed in pencil " Gardner Junr/ Newport May/1758/W. " on the back of the crest rail . Walnut and maple , height 46 3/8 , width 30 , depth 25 7/8 inches . The upholstery is original , as is the needlework back panel , which was stitched in Boston , c. 1758 . Metropolitan Museum of Art , gift of Mrs. J. Insley Blair . // The second piece of needlework given to us by Mr. Holzer is a panel made in Boston ( PI . V ) about 1760 by Mehitable Starkey and passed down in her family until purchased at auction by the Holzers . Unlike most Boston needlework pictures , which tend to be horizontal in composition , this piece is a tall vertical panel , with two discrete scenes placed one above the other . The top scene shows three people harvesting grain ; a woman at the center holds a sickle aloft , while a man at her right cuts the wheat and a man at her left bundles the wheat . The lower scene depicts a landscape with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a group of brick dwellings and a windmill . The unusual composition made Mr. Holzer surmise , rightly we believe , that rather than a picture to be framed and displayed on a wall , the panel was intended to cover the outer back of an easy chair . He came to this conclusion after studying the Metropolitan Museum 's spectacular Newport easy chair of 1758 ( Pl . VI ) , which is covered with its original wool flame-stitch embroidery except for the outer back , which is decorated with a charming pastoral scene of leaping deer and a shepherd and his flock . This panel was clearly made by a young woman who studied needlework at a Boston school . Although the chair frame was made in Newport , the needlework is characteristic of embroideries identified with Boston teachers . The needlework back panel on the easy chair and Mr. Holzer 's panel are about the same size , and both designs are most likely drawn from similar sources . Boston needlework pictures from the period were usually completed in either tent or satin stitch . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Holzer 's is in tent stitch can not obscure the amazing similarities of these two extremely rare upholstery masterpieces . We look forward to displaying them near each other in the coming years . The Holzer Collection contains two outstanding portraits by John Photograph Pl . VII .

Holzer Ali Elai , Camerarts photograph . // Singleton Copley : John Greenleaf and Elizabeth Greenleaf ( Pls . VII and VIII ) extraordinarily early works that have been rarely seen in public . The portraits appealed to us immediately as paintings that would delight museum visitors and scholars alike . Through gift , bequest , and purchase , the museum already has a collection of nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1782 and telling the story of the artists ambition , talent , and travels from Boston to New York and London . The Greenleaf portraits enhance the collection in marvelous ways . While no one ever doubted Copley 's innate talent , these products of his brush , executed when he was about fifteen , give new meaning to the term precocious talent . At that age , with no formal training and very little art to study , Copley not only could paint , but also knew the manner of expression that would please his patrons . In the American Wing , Copley 's portraits of Daniel Crommelin Verplanck ( Pl . IX ) , painted in New York in 1771 , and Midshipman Augustus Brine , painted in London in 1782 , have long hung side by side . They are evidence of Copley 's ability to mold his talents according to venue and level of experience . The Greenleaf portraits make known the seeds of this uncanny ability In a collection where Copley 's ingenious portrait of Mrs. Jerathmael Bowers ( Pl . X ) of about 1763 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume to please his clients , the Greenleaf children , in their richly evocative outfits , prove that he was employing this tactic from the start . As we at the Metropolitan Museum worked out the legal niceties of the Holzer promised gift , including the stipulation that the objects be shown together for a decade near much of the museum 's existing Newport furniture and Copley portraits , the wisdom of the selection became more and more apparent . We had no hesitation in agreeing to the terms because our interest in the objects was unqualified . What mattered most to Philip Holzer and his family-his sons Marc and Stuart will be giving the Copleys - was that we cared as much about their pieces as they did . We believe that visitors to the American Wing will care about them too . Photograph Pl . IX . Daniel Crommelin Verplanck ( 1762-1834 ) , by Copley 1771 . Oil on canvas , 49 1/2 by 40 inches .
