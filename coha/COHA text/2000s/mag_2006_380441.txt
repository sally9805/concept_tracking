When Steve Hindy and Tom Potter founded the Brooklyn Brewery in 1987 , the rest of America was drowning in Bud Light and loving it . There were only 33 other microbrewers in the U.S. , and few people knew or cared why a 100% malted-barley lager might taste better than the King of Beers . The pair rarely thought about getting rich . " Mostly the motivation was not going broke , " Potter says . At one point , they worked in an unheated warehouse , wearing fingerless gloves while filling out invoices . <P> Twenty years later , the big boys are out in the cold . Although mass-produced beer is still the most popular alcoholic beverage in the U.S. , it has been steadily losing ground to wine and liquor . In the first half of 2005 , the big brewers shipped 1.2 million fewer barrels than in the year before . But Americans have n't totally lost their taste for beer . " They may not be drinking more , but they 're drinking better , " says Gary Hemphill , vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a nationwide trend toward affordable luxury , grew 7.1% in the first half of 2005 . <P> But any beer lover hoping to jump on the bandwagon ought first to take a lesson from Beer School , Hindy and Potter 's recent book about how they built their company . Microbreweries had their own version of the dotcom boom and bust in the early 1990s , when it seemed that a brew pub was opening ( and soon closing ) on every corner . The ones that survived " were willing to do the nitty-gritty hard work , " says Ray Daniels , marketing director for craft beer at the Brewers Association , an industry trade group . <P> In other words , it was n't just about the beer . Early on , for example , Hindy , a former newspaper reporter , called legendary designer Milton Glaser ( best known for his I ? NY logo ) every day for weeks to persuade him to create their logo . Glaser 's name lent them some instant cool , and that distinctive B is now a familiar New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their beer , Hindy and Potter drove the trucks themselves and found salesmen who would patiently teach bar managers and convenience-store owners about specialty beer . They even started distributing rival beers , turning that into a hugely profitable business . " It kept us alive when almost all the other small breweries in our area went bankrupt , " Hindy says . <P> They faced their share of troubles too . Hindy once stared down some union toughs " straight out of central casting " who wanted a piece of the construction work on their brewery . A disastrous foray into online beer retailing lost them a million dollars and nearly destroyed their friendship . They survived : last year sales grew 18% , to 53,100 barrels , and the company became one of several craft brewers to enjoy double-digit growth , according to the Brewers Association . <P> With about 3% of the market , specialty beers are not taking over the beer world , but mass-market brewers are paying attention . Anheuser-Busch is leading an effort to elevate the image of beer and focus its ads on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve beers . " They 've tried this before , " Hindy says , but he is n't worried . Big brewers have never been able to duplicate the mystique of craft beer . In an industry long dominated by giants , it 's a good time to be a little guy .
