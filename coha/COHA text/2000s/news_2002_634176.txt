<p> I am inspired to write this to all non-voters out there because of what I saw on a sidewalk in Lake View on the eve of the day marking six months since the Sept. 11 tragedy and about a week before the March 19 election . I saw a man handing out papers to passersby . By the way people were not responding and rudely ignoring him , I thought he must have been a con man or panhandler . When my friend and I got closer , and the man approached us , I realized he was running for judge for the Circuit Court of Cook County . Having never heard of him , and knowing it to be my duty as a citizen to be an informed voter , I took and read his flier . His name is Robert Ronald Tepper . He graduated cum laude from the University of Michigan Law School . He was out on a cold day campaigning to reach voters . He was getting involved . <p> I still can not get out of my mind what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the person personally campaigning for their vote . They were downright ignoring him . I have asked why , and many people tell me that Cook County and politics are so corrupt they have given up . <p> Are we so self-important and so wrapped up in our little lives with our little frustrations  --  which pale in comparison to the unspeakable tragedy inflicted upon those who were killed on Sept. 11 and their loved ones  --  that we ca n't take a little time to be informed voters and to vote ? <p> People are losing and risking their lives to protect ours in the most free and beautiful country in the world . Let 's quit taking for granted what others have been through to help and protect us , and let 's get involved . Let 's vote . <p> March 19 should be a record turnout . <p> Bob O'Neill , Near West Side <p> It seems that the Sun-Times has overlooked an important candidate in the race for state representative in the 6th District . <p> Patricia ( Pat ) Bailey has demonstrated a sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention activities with the city 's CAPS program , helping families as a former state social worker and counseling ex-offenders as a county probation officer . <p> Her volunteer work on behalf of senior citizens has helped curtail senior abuse in her Fuller Park neighborhood . She has become a trusted resource to many seniors for human service information and support . <p> As state representative in the newly created 6th District , Bailey would be able to do more . She is a fighter who understands the critical issues that we face in Woodlawn and Englewood  --  because she lives with us , works with us , goes to church with us and knows us . <p> In the 6th District , we need more jobs . We need affordable housing and better health care services for our seniors . We need crime prevention and more support for our schools . <p> Bailey has promised to fight for these issues in Springfield . I believe that she will fight for all of the families in the 6th District . <p> The Fraternal Order of Police , the Chicago Fire Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board President John Stroger and many other trusted community leaders have endorsed Pat Bailey for state representative . <p> Our neighborhoods need a fighter in Springfield . I urge everyone in the 6th District to support Pat Bailey , Democrat for state representative . <p> Rev. Leon Finney Jr. , <p> The Woodlawn Organization <p> President Bush is doing something about environmental pollution : His energy plan is nothing but rhetorical hot air . <p> Marie Harris , Bartlett <p> While many Americans advocate yet another U.S. attack on Iraq , the Sun-Times fails to educate its readers on the rise of Saddam Hussein in Iraq . Before we , the public , can formulate an educated opinion on this issue , we need to know facts and history . <p> We need to know that Saddam Hussein was a major U.S. ally for many years . During those years , our government supplied him with the weapons he used to massacre his own people . During those years , Amnesty International and other human rights organizations warned us of Hussein 's terrible human rights violations . And during those same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering of Iraqis . <p> Then in 1990 , Iraq , embodied solely by Hussein , became our greatest enemy . Our military launched the greatest attack in U.S. history on the 20 million people of Iraq . Since then , millions have died because of sanctions forced by the United States through the United Nations . Now in 2002 , President Bush claims that Iraq is a threat once again . With no evidence in hand , he contemplates another military strike on the people of Iraq . Before we advocate another round of killings , let 's get the facts straight . <p> D. Mary Jamil , Lake View <p> I read with great interest about the proposal to add to public transit " CTA plans new ' Super Loop , ' " news story , March 11 . As one who travels a great deal on my job , I suggest the following : <p> ? 176-129 ? Figure out a way to connect the outer ring to McCormick Place . <p> ? 176-129 ? Extend the Green Line to the Museum of Science and Industry . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no park-and-ride lot like on the Kennedy or on the Eisenhower . Open up the parking lots at Sox Park ; they sit empty all winter . It would be an easy connection to the Red Line . <p> Karl Szwet , Highland , Ind . <p> The CTA 's proposed Circle Line is a great idea . Let 's hope they can get it built sooner than 10 years from now . Other improvements I suggest : Extend the Englewood branch of the Green Line to Midway Airport , thus serving the densely populated Marquette Park neighborhood , and run the Ravenswood Brown Line to O'Hare Airport , with stops at the Rosemont convention building sites . <p> Max Schiffer , <p> Near North Side <p> Although I applaud the CTA for thinking big and planning new routes and services for an expanded Loop , especially the west Loop , it would be a big mistake not to provide additional service to the increasingly congested areas east of Michigan Avenue . Travelling through the area between North Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier is already a slow go . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed Circle Line to include Navy Pier , the proposed LakeShore East project east of Illinois Center , Millennium Park and possibly the Museum Campus would truly provide a solution to congestion . I encourage the CTA to think a bit bigger . <p> John Hernandez , Edgewater <p> Lower the age of Medicare eligibility to 55 and revive the entrepreneurial spirit that keeps America strong . How many people are trapped in their jobs because they need the health insurance benefits  --  thousands , millions ? The threat of being hospitalized and the bills that follow hang over us like a guillotine . <p> Our economic success has always improved the strength of our nation . Our forefathers unleashed the greatest force in history when they signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , freeing men to pursue their own destiny . This freedom lit the fire of imagination , the foundation of innovation and invention . <p> Great economic strides , which benefit all mankind , are usually associated with the name of an individual , and the greatest inventions in history , which we know by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed , in the barn , at home . <p> To keep the country strong , we must continue to move forward . Our government should promote individual freedom , knowing that this freedom ensures enterprise . <p> Maybe it is time to take another look at Social Security . Should premiums be capped at a certain level ? Should benefits be paid to everyone , whether needed or not ? If we lowered the age of Medicare eligibility to 55 , it would help to change the attitude of our hypochondriac society and move the country to the next level . <p> Richard Wallace , Berkeley <p> With the terrorist attacks and the Enron debacle causing so many of us to doubt the existence of goodwill in the world , here 's a little chicken soup for the soul . <p> About a month ago , I left my wallet in the back seat of a Checker Cab on Michigan Avenue . The wallet contained not only cash , ID and credit cards , but also my Palm organizer . When I realized that I 'd lost it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab number and could n't . It was only with the help of my observant colleague , who was also in the cab , that I even remembered that it was a green Checker Cab . I contacted the cab company and left my information with them , figuring that if I did n't hear anything soon I was doomed . <p> With no word from them by noon the next day , I went to the bank and motor vehicle bureau and waited in lines to replace the missing items . Then I got on eBay and won an auction to replace my Palm V. The only thing I could n't replace was my favorite picture of our baby girl , Alexandra . <p> Two days later , while I was walking our dog , my cell phone rang with news that the wallet had been returned by the Checker Cab people . And nothing was missing  --  not even the $32 cash . So , thank you , Checker , for reinforcing my belief that people are basically decent and will do the right thing . <p> Jim Ware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works full time at $6.50 an hour , how long would it take to earn the equivalent of Chuck Conaway 's " termination payment " " Ex-Kmart CEO to get at least $9.5 million ; Severance to pay $4.5 million , forgive $5 million loan , " Business story , March 13 ? Answer : 481 years ! <p> Two more questions : How does a financially strapped company in the throes of bankruptcy afford a $6.5 million payout to a failed CEO who gave less than two years of service ? Just what has he accomplished in his short-lived tenure as CEO to justify such an outlandish amount ? <p> Kurt Kelly , Des Plaines <p> As faculty members of the University of Illinois at Chicago since the 1960s and long-time residents of the UIC neighborhood , we have had many opportunities to admire the high level of professionalism of the UIC campus police . <p> We are writing to share our appreciation of the UIC police force with all Chicagoans , so well served by the excellent police work that resulted last week in the arrest of Joseph Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CTA storage room . <p> Kathleen Crittenden , <p> Kelvin Rodolfo , <p> Near West Side
