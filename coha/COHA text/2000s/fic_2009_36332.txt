There were days when Molly Snow loved her sister , but this was n't one . She had risen at dawn to be Robin 's water-bearer , only to learn that Robin had changed her mind and decided to do her long run in the late afternoon , fully expecting Molly to accommodate her . <p> And why not ? Robin was a world-class runner-a marathoner with a dozen wins under her belt , incredible stats , and a serious shot at making the Olympics . She was used to people changing their plans to suit hers . She was the star . <p> Resenting that for the millionth time , Molly said no to late afternoon and , though Robin followed her from bedroom to bathroom and back , refused to give in . Robin could have easily run that morning ; she just wanted to have breakfast with a friend . And would n't Molly love to do that herself ! But she could n't , because her day was backed up with work . She had to be at Snow Hill at seven to tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing , track inventory and sales , preorder for the holiday season ; and on top of her own chores , she had to cover for her parents , who were on the road . That meant handling any issues that arose and , worse , leading a management meeting-not Molly 's idea of fun . <p> Her mother would n't be pleased that she had let Robin down , but Molly was feeling too put-upon to care . <p> The good news was that if Robin went running late in the day , she would be out when Molly got home . So , with the sun bronzing her face through the open windows , Molly mellowed as she drove back from Snow Hill . She pulled mail from the roadside box , without asking herself why her sister never did it , and swung in to crunch down the dirt drive . The roses were a soft peach , their fragrance all the more precious for the short life they had left . Beyond were the hydrangeas she had planted , turned a gorgeous blue by a touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TLC . <p> Pulling up under the pin oak that shaded the cottage she and Robin had rented for the past two years but were about to lose , Molly opened the back of the Jeep and began to unload . She was nearly at the house , juggling a drooping split-leaf philodendron , a basket of gourds , and a cat carrier , when her cell phone rang . <p> She could just hear it . I 'm sorry for yelling this morning , Molly , but where are you now ? My car wo n't start , I 'm in the middle of nowhere , and I 'm beat . <p> Molly was shifting burdens to free up a key when the phone rang again . A third ring came as she knelt to put her load down just inside the door . That was when guilt set in . Seconds shy of voice mail , she pulled the phone from her jeans and flipped it open . <p> " Where are you ? " she asked , but the voice at the other end was n't Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " <p> " I 'm a nursing supervisor at Dickenson-May Memorial . There 's been an accident . Your sister is in the ER . We 'd like you to come . " <p> " A car accident ? " Molly asked in alarm . <p> " A running accident . " <p> Molly hung her head . Another one of those . Oh , Robin , she thought and peered into the carrier , more worried about the little amber cat huddled inside than about her sister . Robin was a chronic daredevil . She claimed the reward was worth it , but the price ? A broken arm , dislocated shoulder , ankle sprains , fasciitis , neuroma-you name it , she 'd had it . This small cat , on the other hand , was an innocent victim . <p> " What happened ? " Molly asked distractedly , making little sounds to coax the cat out . <p> " The doctor will explain . Do you live far ? " <p> No , not far . But experience had taught her that she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an MRI . Reaching into the carrier , she gently drew out the cat . " I 'm ten minutes away . How serious is it ? " <p> " I ca n't tell you . But we do need you here . " <p> The cat was shaking badly . She had been found locked in a shed with ten other cats . The vet guessed she was barely two . <p> " My sister has her phone with her , " Molly tried , knowing that if she could talk directly with Robin , she would learn more . " Does she have cell reception ? " <p> " No . I 'm sorry . Your parents ' number is here with yours on her shoe tag . Will you call them , or should I ? " <p> If the nurse was holding the shoe , the shoe was off Robin 's foot . A ruptured Achilles tendon ? That would be bad . Worried in spite of herself , Molly said , " They 're out of state . " She tried humor . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a hint ? " <p> But the nurse was immune to charm . " The doctor will explain . Will you come ? " <p> Did she have a choice ? <p> Resigned , Molly cradled the cat and carried it to her bedroom at the back of the cottage . After nesting it in the folds of the comforter , she put litter and food nearby , and then sat on the edge of the bed . She knew it was dumb bringing an animal here when they had to move out in a week , but her mother refused to let another cat live at the nursery , and this one needed a home . The vet had kept her for several days , but she had n't done well with the other animals . She was n't only malnourished ; she looked like she had been at the losing end of more than one fight . Her little body was poised , as if she expected another blow . <p> " I wo n't hurt you , " Molly whispered assuredly and , giving the cat space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philodendron-too much too soon would only drain through-then took it to the loft and set it out of direct light . It , too , needed TLC . But later . <p> First , a shower . It would have to be a quick one-she could put off the hospital only so long . But the greenhouse was hot in September , and after a major delivery of fall plants , she had spent much of the afternoon breaking down crates , moving pots , reorganizing displays , and sweating . <p> The shower cleared her mind . Back in her room to dress , though , she could n't find the cat . Calling softly , she looked under the bed , in the open closet , behind a stack of cartons . She checked Robin 's room , the small living room , even the basket of gourds-which was one more thing to pack , but it filled an aesthetic need and could easily hide a small cat . <p> She would have looked further , if her conscience had n't begun to nag . Robin was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere between Atlanta and Manchester , and with her own name first on that tag , Molly had to make tracks . <p> Letting her long hair curl as it dried , she put on clean jeans and a tee . Then Molly drove off with the cell in her lap , fully expecting that Robin would call . She would be resilient and sheepish-unless it truly was an Achilles rupture , which would mean surgery and weeks of no running . They were all in trouble if that was the case . An unhappy Robin was a misery , and the timing of this accident could n't be worse . Today 's fifteen-miler was a lead-up to the New York marathon . If she placed among the top ten American women there , she would be guaranteed a spot at the Olympic trials in the spring . <p> The phone did n't ring . Molly was n't sure if that was good or bad , but she did n't see the point of leaving a message for her mother until she knew more . Kathryn and Robin were joined at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathryn felt the pain . <p> It was lovely to be loved that way , Molly groused and , in the next breath , felt remorse . Robin had worked hard to get where she was . And hey , Molly was as proud of her as the rest on race day . <p> It just seemed like running monopolized all their lives . <p> Resentment to remorse and back was such a boringly endless cycle that Molly was glad to pull up at the hospital . Dickenson-May sat on a bluff overlooking the Connecticut River just north of town . The setting would have been charming if not for the reasons that brought people here . <p> Hurrying inside , Molly gave her name to the ER desk attendant and added , " My sister is here . " <p> A nurse approached and gestured her to a cubicle at the end of the hall , where she fully expected to see Robin grinning at her from a gurney . What she saw , though , were doctors and machines , and what she heard was n't her sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the murmur of somber voices and the rhythmic beep of machines . Molly saw bare feet-callused , definitely Robin's-but nothing else of her sister . For the first time , she felt a qualm . <p> One of the doctors came over . He was a tall man who wore large , black-framed glasses . " Are you her sister ? " <p> " Yes . " Through the space he had vacated , she caught a glimpse of Robin 's head-short dark hair messed as usual , but her eyes were closed , and a tube was taped over her mouth . Alarmed , Molly whispered , " What happened ? " <p> " Your sister had a heart attack . " <p> She recoiled . " A what ? " <p> " She was found unconscious on the road by another runner . He knew enough to start CPR . " <p> " Unconscious ? But she came to , did n't she ? " She did n't have to be unconscious . Her eyes might be closed out of sheer exhaustion . Running fifteen miles could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to yet , " said the doctor . " We pulled up hospital records on her , but there 's no mention of a heart problem . " <p> " Because there is n't one , " Molly said and , slipping past him , went to the bed . " Robin ? " When her sister did n't reply , she eyed the tube . It was n't the only worrisome thing . <p> " The tube connects to a ventilator , " the doctor explained . " These wires connect to electrodes that measure her heartbeat . The cuff takes her blood pressure . The IV is for fluids and meds . " <p> So much , so soon ? Molly gave Robin 's shoulder a cautious shake . " Robin ? Can you hear me ? " <p> Robin 's eyelids remained flat . Her skin was colorless . <p> Molly grew more frightened . " Maybe she was hit by a car ? " she asked the doctor , because that made more sense than Robin having a heart attack at the age of thirty-two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a chest X-ray to check on the breathing tube , we could see heart damage . Right now , the beat is normal . " <p> " But why is she still unconscious ? Is she sedated ? " <p> " No . She has n't regained consciousness . " <p> " Then you 're not trying hard enough , " Molly decided and gave her sister 's arm a frantic jiggle . " Robin ? Wake up ! " <p> A large hand stilled hers . Quietly , the doctor said , " We suspect there 's brain damage . She 's unresponsive . Her pupils do n't react to light . She does n't respond to voice commands . Tickle her toe , prick her leg-there 's no reaction . " <p> " She ca n't have brain damage , " Molly said-perhaps absurdly , but the whole scene was absurd . " She 's in training . " When the doctor did n't reply , she turned to her sister again . The machines were blinking and beeping with the regularity of , yes , machines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Both . Her heart stopped pumping . We do n't know how long she was lying on the road before she was found . A healthy thirty-something might have ten minutes before the lack of oxygen would cause brain damage . Do you know what time she started her run ? " <p> " She was planning to start around five , but I do n't know whether she made it by then . " You should have known , Molly . You would have known if you 'd driven her yourself . " Where was she found ? " <p> The doctor checked his papers . " Just past Norwich . That would put her a little more than five miles from here . " <p> But coming or going ? It made a difference if they were trying to gauge how long she had been unconscious . The location of her car would tell , but Molly did n't know where it was . " Who found her ? " <p> " I ca n't give you his name , but he 's likely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to panic , Molly held her forehead . " She could wake up and be fine , right ? " <p> The doctor hesitated seconds too long . " She could . The next day or two are crucial . Have you called your parents ? " <p> Her parents . Nightmare . She checked her watch . They would n't have landed yet . " My mom will be devastated . Ca n't you do something before I call them ? " <p> " We want her stabilized before we move her . " <p> " Move her where ? " Molly asked . She had a flash shot of the morgue . Too much CSI . <p> " The ICU . She 'll be watched closely there . " <p> Molly 's imagination was stuck on the other image . " She is n't going to die , is she ? " If Robin died , it would be Molly 's fault . If she had been there , this would n't have happened . If she had n't been such a rotten sister , Robin would be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Let 's take it step by step , " the doctor said . " First , stabilization . Beyond that , it 's really a question of waiting . There 's no husband listed on her tag . Does she have kids ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Well , that 's something . " <p> " It 's not . " Molly was desperate . " You do n't understand . I ca n't tell my mother Robin is lying here like this . " Kathryn would blame her . Instantly . Even before she knew that it truly was Molly 's fault . It had always been that way . In her mother 's eyes , Molly was five years younger and ten times more troublesome than Robin . <p> Molly had tried to change that . She had grown up helping Kathryn in the greenhouse , taking on more responsibility as Snow Hill grew . She had worked there summers while Robin trained , and had gotten the degree in horticulture that Kathryn had sworn would stand her in good stead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly loved plants . But she also loved pleasing her mother , which was n't always an easy thing to do , because Molly was impulsive . She spoke without thinking , often saying things her mother did n't want to hear . And she hated pandering to Robin . That was her greatest crime of all . <p> Now the doctor wanted her to call Kathryn and tell her that Robin might have brain damage because she , Molly , had n't been there for her sister ? <p> It was too much to ask of her , Molly decided . After all , she was n't the only one in the family . <p> While the doctor waited expectantly , she pulled out her phone . " I want my brother here . He has to help . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
