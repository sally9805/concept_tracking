Chapter 1 : Jerked into the Night " Wake up , Robin ! " I heard my mother say . I felt myself being rocked hard . At first I thought the rocking was in my dream , a dream so deep I had to swim up to consciousness like a diver from the ocean floor . Each time my mother shook my shoulder , I drew closer and closer to the surface , moaning . " Quiet ! " she ordered . " You 'll wake Grandpa and Grandma and I 'll have my hands full of spilt milk . Darn it , Robin . I told you what time we were headin ' outta here . You have n't even finished packin ' , " she said . My suitcase was open on the floor , some of my clothes still beside it . Mother darling had insisted I not begin until after I supposedly went to bed last night . My mother said I could n't bring but one suitcase of my things , and it was hard to decide what to take and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be a country singing star and had to have her outfits and all her boots and every hat as well as half a suitcase of homemade audiotapes she thought would win the admiration of an important record producer in Nashville . I sat up and pressed my palms over my cheeks , patting them like Grandpa always did when he put on aftershave lotion . The skin on my face was still asleep and felt numb . My mother stood back and looked at me with her small nose scrunched , which was something she always did when she was very annoyed . She also twisted her full lips into her cheek . She had the smallest mouth for someone who could sing as loudly as she could , but most women envied her lips . I know that some of her friends went for collagen shots to get theirs like hers . Everyone said we looked like sisters because I had the same petite features , the same rust-colored hair , and the same soft blue eyes . Nothing she heard pleased her more . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or anyone 's mother for that matter . She was thirty-two years old this week , and she was convinced she had absolutely her last chance to become a singing star . She said she had to pass me off as her younger sister or she would n't be taken seriously . I was sixteen last month , and she wanted everyone , especially people in show business , to believe she was just in her mid-twenties . Although I was closer to one of her idols , Dolly Parton , than she was when it came to breasts , we did have similar figures , both being a shade more than five feet five . She always looked taller because she hardly ever wore anything but boots . She wore hip-hugging tight jeans most of the time , and when she went out to sing at what she called another honky-tonk , she usually tied the bottom of her blouse so there was a little midriff showing . Grandpa would swell up with anger , his face nearly breaking out in hives , or just blow out his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ways of the righteous , brought you up to be a churchgoing girl , and you still dress like a street tramp . Even after ... after ... your Fall , " he told her , and swung his eyes my way . That 's what I was in his way of thinking : the Fall , the result of " the grand sin of fornication . " Mother darling had been sexually active at the age of fifteen and had me when she was only sixteen . Grandpa , despite despising the situation as much as he did , would not permit even talk of an abortion . " You abide by your actions and pay for your sins . It 's the only path toward redemption , " he preached then , according to Mother darling , and preached now . I remember the first time I was arrested for shoplifting . The policewoman knew my grandparents and asked me how I could behave so badly coming from a solid , religious , and loving home . Was n't I just a self-centered ingrate ? I fixed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want me . My grandparents forced me down her throat , and she never stops throwing that back at them . How would you like living in such a solid , religious , and loving home ? " She blinked as if she had soot in her eyes and then grunted and went off mumbling about teenagers . I was just barely one . It was two days after my thirteenth birthday and the first time I was arrested . I had shoplifted a number of times before , but I was never caught . It amazed me how really easy it was . Half the time , if not more , those machines that are supposed to ring do n't ; and the employees , especially of the department stores , do n't seem to care enough to watch for it . I practically waved whatever it was I was taking in front of their faces . Many times I threw away whatever I took almost immediately afterward . I could n't chance bringing it home . Grandpa placed all the blame on Mother darling , telling her she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way she dressed and singing in places " the devil himself wo n't enter . " He would rant at her , waving his thick right forefinger in the air like an evangelist in one of those prayer meetings in large tents . He made me attend them with him when I was younger , claiming he had to work extra hard on me since I was spawned from sin . Anyway , he would bellow at Mother darling so loudly , the walls of the old farmhouse shook . Grandma would try to calm him down , but he would sputter and stammer like one of his old tractors , usually concluding with " Thank goodness she took on your mother 's maiden name , Kay Jackson . When she goes singing in those bars , I can pretend I do n't know who she is . " " You do n't have to pretend . You do n't know who I am , Daddy , " my mother would fire back at him . " Never did , never will . I 'm writin ' a song about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa would finally say and retreat . He was close to sixty-five but looked more like fifty , with a full head of light brown hair with just a touch of gray here and there , and thick , powerful-looking shoulders and arms . He could easily lift a fully grown Dorset Horn sheep and carry it a mile . Despite his strength and his rage , I never saw him lift his hand to strike my mother or me . I think he was afraid of his own strength . My grandparents owned a sheep farm about ten miles east of Columbus , just outside the village of Granville . The farm was no longer active , although Grandpa kept a dozen Olde English Babydoll sheep that he raised and sold . Before she went anywhere , Mother darling would practically bathe herself in cologne , claiming the stench of sheep and pigs permeated the house . " It sinks into your very soul , " she claimed , which was another thing that set Grandpa on fire , the farm being his way of life and his living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick of dynamite . Sometimes , I thought she was doing it on purpose , just to see how far he would go . The most I saw him do was slam his fist down on the kitchen table and make the dishes jump so high , one fell off and shattered . " That , " he said , pointing to it and then to her , " gets added to your rent . " Ever since Mother darling quit high school and worked in the supermarket and then began to sing nights with one pair of musicians or another , Grandpa insisted she pay rent for her and for me . It was n't much , but it took most of her supermarket salary , which was another justification she used for her singing , not that she needed any . She was convinced she could be a big star . I knew she was saving up for something big . Suddenly , she was willing to work overtime at the supermarket and she took any singing gig she and her partners at the time could get , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the malls in Columbus . Then one night , she slipped into my room , closing the door softly behind her . She stood with her back against the door and looked like she had won the lottery . Her face was that bright , her eyes seemed full of fireflies . " We 're leavin ' this trap tomorrow night , " she said in a voice just above a whisper . " What ? To where ? " " I 've got a job in Nashville with a three-piece band my old boyfriend from high school , Cory Lewis , runs . He 's the drummer and they lost their singer . She ran off with a car salesman to live in Beverly Hills , which I 'm sure was just an old tire which will go flat before they get close . Not that I care . It 's become an opportunity for me . We 're going to play in places where real record producers go to listen for new talent . " " Nashville ? " " You do n't make it in country music if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now here 's what I want you to do . Quietly pack one suitcase . It 's all I got room for in the Beetle . " Mother darling had an old yellow Volkswagen Beetle that looked like someone with a tantrum had kicked and punched it for hours . The car was rusted out in places so badly , you could see through to the road beneath , and it had a cracked window on the passenger 's side . " But is n't Nashville very far away ? " " If you attended class more often , you 'd know it 's only a little over four hundred miles from here , Robin . Four hundred in actual distance , but a million in dreams , " she added . " That lawn mower you drive wo n't make it . " " Just shut your sewer mouth and pack , " she ordered , losing her patience . " We 're leavin ' at two this mornin ' . Very quietly . I do n't want him on my tail , " she said , nodding toward Grandpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na be there ? " I asked , and she shook her head . " Girl , do n't you get it ? We 're leavin ' here for good . I ca n't leave you with Grandpa and Grandma , Robin . Believe me , I wish I could , but they 're too old to be watchin ' after you , bailin ' you out of trouble every week . And it 's now or never for me . I 'm gettin ' nowhere singin ' in the honky-tonks here . It 's nothing for you to leave the school , so do n't make like it is , " she warned . " You 've been suspended a half-dozen times for one thing or another . They wo n't miss you when the new year begins and you 're not there , " she reminded me . " And do n't try tellin ' me you 'll miss your friends , Robin . Those nobodies you hang out with just get you into more trouble . I might be savin ' your life the same time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . Despite her bravado , Mother darling was still frightened of Grandpa . " If we 're lucky , he wo n't realize we 're gone until it comes time for him to collect his rent . In his mind that was a way of imposin ' penance on me for havin ' you . Pack , " she ordered , then opened the door quietly and slipped out as fast as a shadow caught in the light . I could n't help but admit surprise at her courage . For as long as I could remember , she talked about picking up and leaving Granville . But it was certainly one thing to talk about it and another to actually do it . Despite Grandpa 's monthly rent and his ranting and raving about saving our souls , we had a home . Grandma cooked our meals , and even though Mother darling and I were supposed to do our share of the household chores , Grandma usually did them for us . She had them to baby-sit for me when I was younger so she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " coddling the devil " to perform " half-naked " in " slime pits . " He talked so much about the devil and hell that I used to believe he had been there and back . One of these days , I thought , he will bring out some pictures to show me tortured souls . When the farm was active , he tried to get Mother darling to work , feeding and caring for the variety of sheep he raised , as well as miniature Hereford cattle . On purpose or not , she was more trouble than value to him , always wasteful when she was shearing . He finally gave up on her , which could n't have pleased her more . By the time I was old enough to be of any use , he was retreating from the business and there was n't much to do . He let all his help go . Anyway , after she had awoken me , I splashed some cold water on my face and finished packing . Of course , she had promised to buy me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had earned big money in the music business . I could n't deny she had a nice voice and looked pretty up on a stage , but it just seemed so unreal to think of her as actually making records and being on television or singing in front of thousands of people . I did n't tell her that . Nothing would set her off as much as being told she did n't have what it takes . Actually , I envied her for having some sort of dream at least . The only thing I looked forward to when we left was a cup of strong coffee . She was at the door fifteen minutes later . " Ready ? " she asked . I had the suitcase packed and closed and I was sitting on my bed with my eyes closed . I was falling asleep again , hoping it was just a dream . " I 've already got all my things in the car , " she whispered . " C'm on , wake up , Robin . " Impatient , she picked up my suitcase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you take ? " " Just what I needed , " I said . She grimaced and led the way . Grandpa always kept his hallway lights low to save on electricity . The weak illumination , the heavy thick shadows following along the wall , all made me feel it was still a dream . It was mid-July , but nights and mornings were cold to me . I shuddered , wrapped my arms around myself , and followed Mother darling down the fieldstone walkway to the car . A partially overcast night sky provided minimum starlight . The whole world looked asleep . I felt like I was sneaking into a painting . The car doors complained when we opened them , metal shrieking . Mother darling started the engine without putting on the lights and drove slowly down the long driveway . I was still in a state of disbelief , groggy , my eyes half closed . " Good riddance to this , " she muttered . " I 'm gettin ' out . I 'm gettin ' away , finally . " I turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window and the top of the seat . I could n't crawl into the rear because she had her guitar there resting on a pillow she would n't let me use . Nevertheless , despite the bumps and turns , I fell asleep . I woke up to the screaming shrill sound of a tractor trailer as it passed us by on the highway . We were already on I-71 South heading toward Louisville . The driver in the tractor trailer sounded his horn again . " Donkey , " Mother darling called him . I groaned and sat up straighter , stretching my arms . Suddenly , it all came back to me . " I thought I was dreaming , " I told her . She laughed . " No more , Robin . Dreams turn into reality now , " she vowed . I saw the road signs . " I do n't see why we have to go to a place where people call people Bubba and Sissy , " I complained . Mother darling knew how much I disliked country music . I told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you  --  it 's where you have to go to make it in country music , " she said . " Country music . You 've got to chew on straw and be barefoot most of the time to like it . " She practically pulled off the highway , jerking herself around to yell at me . " You 'd better keep that stupid opinion to yourself when we get there , Robin . People in Nashville have been known to hang rock-and-rollers like you by their ears for less . " " Yeah , yeah , right , " I said . " I do n't see how you can afford to make fun of anyone anyway , Robin . You 're sixteen and you 've already got a criminal record . You should be happy I 'm takin ' you to a place no one knows you . You 'll have a chance to start new , make new friends . " " Friends . You never liked any of my friends and probably never will , no matter where we live . In fact , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you talking about now ? " " When I was in that school play in seventh grade , everybody else 's mother or father was there , but not my mother darling . My mother darling was strumming a guitar in some sawdust-floor saloon instead . " " Damn , you never let me forget that , do you ? I do the best I can , Robin . It 's not easy bein ' a single mother , and my parents never helped us all that much . You know Grandpa took my money , even though he condemned me for the way I earned it . You know what he says , ' There 's no such thing as dirty money , only dirty people . ' He 's been punishin ' me ever since I got pregnant with you , " she reminded me . " You should have run off and had an abortion . I wish I was n't born anyway . " " Yeah , right . That 's easy for you to say now . Bein ' a girl out there alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's not been a picnic for me livin ' with my parents and hearin ' Grandpa complain about you all the time , blamin ' me for every stupid thing you do . " " Do n't worry , Mother darling . I 'm not complaining about your not leaving me back there with them . I 'd probably have run off anyway . " " I do n't doubt it . I know I 'm savin ' your life takin ' you with me , Robin . The least you could do is be a little grateful and very cooperative . And another thing , I do n't want you callin ' me Mother darlin ' anymore . I know you 're just bein ' sarcastic ' cause of that book Mommie Dearest . Besides , " she said , " I told you how I have to present myself as bein ' younger . From the day we get to Nashville , until I say otherwise , you 're my younger sister . Always call me Kay . " " That wo n't be hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling someone Mother for her to be a mother . " " Oh , you 're so smart . " She thought a moment . " Actually , I like that . It 's a great first line for a new song : It takes more than calling someone Mother for her to be a mother , " she sang . She looked at me . " Thanks . " I shook my head and stared at the floor . She turned on one of her country music stations and began to sing along . The happier she was , the angrier and more depressed I became . This was n't my dream life ; it was hers . I was like a piece of paper stuck to the bottom of her boots . She could n't shake me off , and I could n't pull away . The road streamed ahead . She saw only promise and glory . I just saw a strip of highway going to nowhere , which was where I had been . Why did she ever name me Robin ? I thought . She should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : trapped in a cage . All I had to do was tell her and she would turn it into another song .
