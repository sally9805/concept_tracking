<p> " They did n't have books like this when I was growing up ! " wailed a friend as she sorted through some of this season 's selections . She 's right . For decades , children 's books have been getting more sophisticated , more diverse - and maybe more beautiful . Here 's an armload of spring offerings for your inspection . Concept BookS For centuries , alphabet books have been the quintessential concept books - those volumes that teach basic educational skills to youngsters . It 's a jam-packed genre , but Kipper 's A to Z : An Alphabet Adventure , by Mick Inkpen , is a welcome addition because it 's entertaining as well as instructional . Inkpen provides plenty of clear and appealing illustrations . Kipper , a sweet-faced little pup , is already a familiar character to many children . More than 5 million Kipper books are in print , and they 've been translated into more than 20 languages . Here , Kipper and his piglet friend Arnold set off through the pages collecting animals and items to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the subtitle suggests . They start with " a is for ant , " but it wo n't stay in the " b for box , " so eventually we get " e for empty . " Those kinds of connections make this a fun and satisfying book . Picture books Originally published in France , Lisa 's Airplane Trip arrived stateside this month . C'est manifique ! It 's the start of a new series about two fuzzy doglike critters , Lisa and Gaspard . In this delightful volume , Lisa tells about her first airplane ride - the seats , the food , and the in-flight entertainment . Illustrator Georg Hallensleben 's art is bold and bright enough to engage kids while sophisticated and painterly enough to please adults . Anne Gutman 's text is also equal to the task of amusing both child and parent . For example , after Lisa has a bit of a mishap , " the airplane lady " washes her clean and gives her a tour of the cockpit . When one of the pilots comments that Lisa smells nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The book 's overall design is pleasing : It 's a slim square of springtime green with little Lisa ( safely buckled into her airplane seat ) staring unblinkingly from the cover . Colorful endpapers teem with airplanes and airport activity . And the back displays six small pictures , which serve as a traveler 's photo album and as a reader 's introduction . A winner ? Mais oui ! Not all travel requires airplanes . In the case of A Journey , by wife-and-husband team Sarah Stewart and David Small , the trip is accomplished by a horse and buggy and a bus . Hannah , a young Amish girl , boards a bus to Chicago for her very first visit . She records her thoughts and experiences in a diary - her silent friend - and these entries become the text of the story . Stewart 's tale captures Hannah 's awe of and interest in the big city , and at the same time chronicles her longing for home . Small 's loose ink-and-watercolor illustrations depict each day 's busy activities , but every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread of Hannah 's farm life . The visual pacing is superb , and it creates an affectionate balance between exciting travel and a comforting home . The Stray Dog , by Marc Simont , was 15 years in the making - and well worth the wait . It 's based on a true account of a family that finds a dog they ca n't forget . When they discover the authorities consider it a stray , the family adopts the little pooch and saves him from the dog catcher . This heartwarming story comes alive in Simont 's lean , expressive text and his engaging illustrations . Despite its simplicity , the tale evokes a range of emotions that will feel genuine to any young reader . Books for Older Readers The Sketchbook of Thomas Blue Eagle is an elegant and intriguing book . Written by twin sisters Gay Matthaei and Jewel Grutman , it is a fictional account of a young Lakota brave in the late 1800s . When the US government relocates Plains Indians to reservations , the traditional Lakota ways begin dying out . Thomas Blue Eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit from their hunting skills by joining Buffalo Bill Cody 's Wild West Show . There , they meet such western greats as Annie Oakley . Blue Eagle 's riding and bow-and-arrow talents make him a star of the show as he travels throughout the United States and Europe . All the while , though , his thoughts are back home with Echo , the young woman he hopes to marry . ( Ostensibly , he makes this sketchbook for her so he can bring back images of all he 's seen . ) The illustrations by Adam Cvijanovic are a stunning part of this book . He starts by using a flat pictograph style that changes to a more three-dimensional look as Blue Eagle encounters European artists . This fascinating volume is a sequel to the award-winner " The Ledgerbook of Thomas Blue Eagle . " Both are grounded in historical research and include comments from a native-American historian . Meanwhile , Beverly Cleary of " Ramona " fame has a quartet of books out this spring . These brightly colored paperback reprints , originally written in the late 1950s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first love . The eagerness , anxiety , and sheer clumsiness of first dates are perfectly portrayed in these delightful period pieces . They are full of good manners , intact families , outdated slang , and amazingly low prices - 75 cents an hour for babysitters . Fifteen is about Jane and Stan 's budding relationship , which strengthens when Jane decides to " just be herself . " The ups and downs include a Chinatown visit , not being able to borrow the family car , attending a school dance , going steady , and experiencing a first kiss . The Luckiest Girl is about Shelly taking her junior year of high school in sunny California . While she spends most of that year dating a handsome basketball star , in the last weeks she learns that she really likes a more interesting , but less popular boy . Jean and Johnny is about Jean 's crush on the school heartthrob . Although Johnny encourages her , he does n't treat her well .

In brief summaries , these books sound quaint or trite , but each features sound advice , good morals , and strong role models tucked into believable stories . Information Books For years , DK books have sported gorgeous color photographs , and this season is no exception . High-flyin ' kids will love the DK Big Book of Airplanes , edited by Caroline Bingham . It 's an oversize picture book packed with plane info . There are double-page spreads on stunt planes , crop dusters , seaplanes , jumbo jets , spy planes , and more . Short paragraphs are inserted around the bright photos , giving useful descriptions and interesting facts . ( For example , did you know that jumbo jets fly 10 times higher than ultralights ? That an F-16 combat fighter requires 45 minutes of checks before take-off ? Or that the fastest jet-engine craft was clocked at 2,193 m.p.h. ? ) Be warned : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down . Shipwrecked ! , by Rhoda Blumberg , is the remarkable true adventure of a teenage fisherman who helped build a diplomatic bridge between the United State and Japan . This was hardly an easy task in the 1800s , when Japan enforced a strict isolationist policy . Young Manjiro 's saga began in January 1841 when he and some fellow fishermen survived a tremendous storm , which left them shipwrecked on a deserted island off the coast of Japan . After several months , an American whaling vessel rescued them , taking the castaway crew to Hawaii . That act alone doomed the fishermen to death if they ever returned home . Harsh Japanese laws forbade the influence of other countries , and one law read : " Any person who leaves the country to go to another and later returns will be put to death . " Manjiro , who was quick and bright , easily picked up English and then wanted to learn how to navigate the seas . So , leaving his friends in Hawaii , he traveled to New Bedford , Mass. , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first Japanese-born person to set foot in America . Through Manjiro 's intelligence , persistence , and courage , Japanese ports were opened and a treaty of peace was signed between the two countries . Old photos , maps , paintings , and black-and-white illustrations contribute visual appeal to this captivating story .
