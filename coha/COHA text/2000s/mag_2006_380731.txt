THE SHIRLEY TEMPLE COLLECTION , VOLUME 3 <P> The top box-office star of the ' 30s was 6 years old when she became a leading lady . Kids by the millions wanted her curls , her doll , the nonalcoholic cocktail named for her . Oh , there was a clockwork tinge to her adorability , her sugary films were anathema to sophisticates , and parts of her plantation musicals ( such as The Little Colonel and The Littlest Rebel in this set ) were , and are , criminally patronizing . But even Dakota Fanning does n't hit every one out of the park and , man , Shirley could tap-dance  --  dance away the Depression , some said , or at least the depression in Hollywood . Here 's a three-part dose of optimism from the New Deal 's youngest and most potent ambassador . <P> THE SPIKE LEE JOINT COLLECTION <P> Time was when a Spike Lee movie was an infallible social blood test : if yours did n't heat up at his take on racial tensions , you probably needed a transfusion . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mo ' Better Blues , Jungle Fever , Clockers , Crooklyn ) years later , though , one can see the camera stylist behind the street-corner Savonarola . Sure , he editorializes with nearly every shot , but he 's also a clever fellow at framing the action and getting sharp turns from lots of terrific actors . This joint 's worth dropping into . <P> THE MEL BROOKS COLLECTION <P> The man who gave movie bad taste a good name finally has his own boxed set , with eight features ( The Twelve Chairs , Blazing Saddles , Young Frankenstein , Silent Movie , High Anxiety , To Be or Not to Be , History of the World , Part I and Robin Hood : Men in Tights )  --  virtually the entire canon , minus The Producers . Most of those are extensions of the genre parodies Brooks and other early-TV geniuses wrote for Sid Caesar . The gags are hit-and-miss , but when they hit , you feel them in your gut . And each film has at least one shining moment , whether it be flatulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooks commentaries . The collection is incomplete without a juicy vat of pinwheeling ad libs from the foremost tummler  --  sorry , raconteur  --  of our time . <P> GREENAWAY : THE EARLY FILMS <P> The triple-sec alternative to Mel Brooks ' very wet humor , Peter Greenaway is the commercial cinema 's pre-eminent avant-gardist . Back before he made The Draughtsman 's Contract and 8 1/2 Women , he made meticulously malevolent short films ( seven are collected here ) and The Falls , a three-hour fake-umentary about 92 people whose lives were altered by a Violent Unknown Event . The textual and textural density is intoxicating , the English wit so dry you could choke on it . A sturdy challenge for movie lovers  --  and unmissable . <P> THE BUSBY BERKELEY COLLECTION
