<p> In the front yard of a rundown house in East Palo Alto , Alicia Sosa 's two daughters chase each other with squirt guns . <p> Although the neighborhood is haunted by drug dealers with real guns , Sosa does n't keep the girls indoors . <p> " They always want to play outside , they do n't want to stay in here , " said Sosa , as she bounced her baby son on her knee . <p> That 's understandable . Sosa , a janitor for Sun Microsystems , her husband and three children rent one room in the three-bedroom single-family house for $500 a month . Between the bed , crib , refrigerator , microwave , television and a small table , there is scarcely room to breathe , let alone play . They share a kitchen with 17 other people . <p> But Sosa is optimistic . <p> The union that represents her and about 5,000 other janitors in Silicon Valley and the East Bay is fighting for a large wage increase as its contract nears expiration on May 31 . Negotiations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The contractors , fearful of being out-priced by nonunion competitors , have offered only a fraction of the raise the union wants . <p> But the union is courting a Goliath-size ally : the high-tech industry . If the tech giants that indirectly employ 1,200 of the union 's workers can assure the contracting companies that they wo n't be dumped for nonunion firms if the price of janitorial services goes up , the union is much more likely to win its bid for 16 percent annual increases . <p> The union has talked its way into the boardrooms of five major Silicon Valley companies , and all have been open to the possibility of helping . <p> Only 3Com has publicly acknowledged the meetings , but one of the five companies , which plans to identify itself Tuesday , is trying to recruit other tech firms to come to the janitors ' aid . The rest of the valley 's tech titans have thus far turned a deaf ear to the janitors ' requests for support . Because they all contract out their janitorial work , most companies say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't want to get involved . <p> The union has less than two weeks to change its mind . <p> Sosa , an immigrant from Mexico , is no tech wizard . She does n't have a college degree and  --  like most janitors in the union  --  she does n't speak much English . Despite the Bay Area 's low unemployment rate , her boss at OneSource , a maintenance contractor , could easily replace her if she left . <p> Still , Sosa deserves a share of the vast riches being created in Silicon Valley , said Kent Wong , director of the University of California at Los Angeles labor research center . <p> " In this time , in a booming economy , there 's something very wrong when people who do an indispensable job in the economy are not benefiting from the wealth that 's being created , " Wong said . <p> Jim Edwards , senior vice president of San Francisco 's American Building Maintenance , acknowledges that it is hard to live in the Bay Area on what the janitors earn . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without their clients ' approval . <p> " I 'd love to pay them 10 , 15 bucks an hour , but there is still so much nonunion competition out there , and customers wo n't pay that for entry level positions like these , " Edwards said . <p> About 30 percent of the janitors in the area are employed by nonunion contractors , who , Edwards estimated , pay about $7 an hour . <p> Under the proposal from Service Employees International Local 1877 , the janitors , most of whom earn $8.04 an hour , would get hourly wage increases totaling $4.50 over the next three years . The contractors have offered to pay for a $1.60 wage increase , spread over the next five years . <p> The last contract negotiations , in 1996 , resulted in four weeks of on-and-off strikes . <p> Last month , janitors in Los Angeles ended a nearly monthlong strike to accept a contract that would raise downtown workers ' wages from an average of $6.90 an hour to $8.80 over three years . Earlier this month , San Diego janitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In both cities , the unions  --  which are affiliated with the janitors union here  --  succeeded by drawing building owners , tenants and the public into their struggle . The strategy of involving high-tech  --  a high-profile industry whose wealth captures the public 's attention  --  is a promising extension of that strategy , said Ellen J. Dannin , a labor law professor at California Western School of Law . <p> " You 're taking people who are really expendable , very low-skilled work , easily replacable , " Dannin said . " They have very little bargaining power . So they parlay other resources to make them stronger . " <p> Mark Gomez , a strategist for Service Employees International janitors on the West Coast , said he hopes the high-tech industry will be even more influential than L.A. 's real estate owners . Most of Silicon Valley 's high-tech heavyweights , including Apple , Hewlett-Packard and Oracle , use the union 's janitors . <p> " These are the companies that are creating the new economy , and this is the center of the greatest creation of wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more money to go around than there was in San Diego and L.A. , and that bodes well for the janitors . " <p> In meetings with tech companies , union Vice President Tom Csekey and other representatives tell the executives about the lives of the janitors and how the raises they seek could ease their burdens . <p> They tell of families like Sosa 's , whose two daughters , Itzel , 6 , and Laura , 5 , have nowhere to sleep but a shared baby 's crib . <p> Her situation is not unique . A survey by the labor union showed that 12 percent of janitors and their families live in a single room , garage or mobile home . That is why one of the rallying cries of the union is " A bedroom for my kids . " <p> Union officials also tell tech executives about another priority : helping janitors cut back on second jobs . The union 's survey shows that the average janitor 's household works a combined 104 hours each week . It 's common for janitors who work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Magdalena Paz juggles caring for her two daughters with working two jobs in order to make the mortgage payments on the three-bedroom San Jose townhouse they share with four other adults and three other children . At night , Paz cleans the Sunnyvale offices of Advanced Micro Devices , and five or six days a week , she cleans houses . <p> Paz says her children , Mayra , 10 , and Melissa , 6 , do n't mind sharing a small bedroom  --  two to a bed with an extra mattress on the floor  --  with their three female cousins . They like staying up whispering and giggling late into the night while their mom is away at work , she said . <p> What the girls do mind is seeing so little of their mother . With only four hours of sleep a night , Paz sometimes nods off while the girls watch cartoons after school . <p> " They are asking me all the week , Mommy , when can we go to McDonald 's , or the park ? ' and I say , Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , too . " <p> With the $1.30 an hour raise the union is asking in the first year of a new contract , Paz said she could cut back on her daytime housecleaning . Then she could pay more attention to her daughters , who are approaching their difficult teenage years . <p> " Our hope is that ( the tech companies ) are sensitive to these issues , " Csekey said of the meetings . " Even though they 're not the direct employer , they clearly are the power that can make the decision about giving more money to the contractor . It 's really in their hands . " <p> Union leaders hope that more of the large companies they have met with will come forward with support . <p> " We think that these companies are the ones that are going to set the standard by which the other ( tech ) companies will follow , " Gomez said . <p> In Los Angeles , one downtown property owner , Rob Maguire , was influential in getting building owners to pressure their contractors to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of companies , most of the tech industry wants nothing to do with the affair . Companies stress that the janitors are not their employees . <p> " We are not a third party that would get in between a company and its employees , " said Intel Chief Executive Craig Barrett . " I buy equipment from ( Cisco CEO ) John Chambers . Should I be telling John Chambers how to run his company ? " <p> Intel is one of the few major Silicon Valley companies that contracts for nonunion janitors , although its janitors earn wages and benefits comparable to what union janitors get . <p> The Rev. Jesse Jackson , who marched alongside striking janitors in Los Angeles last month , said the tech companies should take responsibility for the economic disparity between their own workers and the janitors employed by contractors . <p> " The idea of subcontracting the janitors and saying it 's not their responsibility will not pass the smell test , " Jackson told The Chronicle . <p> Maguire , the Los Angeles building owner , agreed . " You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for us , ' " he said . " They may not be direct employees , but they do work for us . " <p> Aside from being the moral thing to do , publicly supporting the janitors would be a wise move on the companies ' part , UCLA 's Wong said . <p> " If you have a janitorial workforce that is making a living wage with health benefits , that provides a much more stable economic environment . That provides more stability in the workplace , " he said . <p> The union 's pressure comes at a time when Silicon Valley is showing more interest in social responsibility . Many of the same companies that have declined to get involved with the janitor issue have recently pledged millions of dollars worth of hardware and services toward bridging the " digital divide "  --  the gap in access to technology that many believe will prevent low-income people from participating in the information economy . <p> Earlier this month , Jackson gathered the CEOs of Hewlett-Packard , Cisco , Intel , AMD and other tech firms in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the digital revolution . The CEOs proudly spoke of their companies ' attempts to bridge the digital divide through funding education and donating computers . <p> Instead of giving computers , these companies could do more toward bridging the digital divide by helping their janitors get a living wage , said Marion Steeg , staff director for the South Bay Central Labor Council . <p> " The digital divide is not really about whether someone has a computer in their home and is hooked up to the Internet , " Steeg said . " The digital divide is about having a fair wage and being able to share in the economic prosperity . " <p> In conversations with The Chronicle , several CEOs acknowledged that their janitors are part of their companies . But they stopped short of saying they would endorse rate increases from their cleaning contractors to cover raises for janitors . <p> Carly Fiorina , CEO of Hewlett-Packard , said , " We care very deeply about all the employees who work for us , whether they work directly for Hewlett-Packard or for subcontractors . We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> John Chambers , CEO of Cisco , hinted that his company would be unlikely to switch to a nonunion contractor if the price of janitorial services goes up . <p> " You stay with vendors who treat people fairly , " Chambers said . <p> Besides the relatively congenial meetings , the union is also using more confrontational tactics to put tech companies in the spotlight . On April 27 , the union stopped traffic on El Camino Real in Mountain View , carrying signs that called out the companies by name , pointing out the gap between their high earnings and janitors ' low wages . The signs displayed the amount of time the union believes it would take each company to earn enough to pay for the requested raises for the janitors that work there . <p> " IBM : 1/2 minute sales , " one sign read ; " 3Com : 1 minute sales , " said another . The calculations are based on published sales figures , the number of janitors working at each company , and the requested wage increases beyond a 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the union is turning up the heat on specific companies by releasing flyers and news releases criticizing companies that wo n't play ball . <p> Last client company so far to explicitly oppose the janitors ' requested raises , said union analyst Isobel White . <p> Sosa says she attends many of the rallies because she is " fighting for something that will improve life " for her and her children . <p> " I 'd like to rent a place with two bedrooms , " she said , " one for the kids and one for us . " She knows that could cost as much as $1,000 monthly , which could exceed any raise she receives . <p> " Even a one-bedroom apartment would be better than this .
