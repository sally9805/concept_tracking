I met Penny Driver two months after my twenty-eighth birthday  --  or two months after my second birthday , depending on how you want to count it . Jake was up first that morning , as he is most mornings , barreling out of his room around sunrise , thundering down the stairs to the common room , the clamor of his progress setting off a chain reaction of wakings among the other souls in the house . Jake is five years old , and has been since 1973 , when he was born from the wreckage of a dead soul named Jacob ; he is a mature five , but still basically a little kid , and not very good about respecting other people 's need for quiet . Jake 's stomping roused Aunt Sam , who started up cursing ; and Aunt Sam 's cursing woke Adam , who has the room next to hers ; and Adam , who is old enough to respect other people 's need for quiet , but often chooses not to , let out a series of war whoops until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock it off . By then , everyone was awake . I might have tried to ignore it . Unlike the others , I do n't sleep in the house , I sleep in the body , and when you 're in the body , even the loudest house-noises are just echoes in Andy Gage 's head that can be tuned out at will  --  unless they come from the pulpit . But Adam knows this , of course , and whenever I do try to oversleep , he 's out on the pulpit in no time , crowing like a rooster until I take the hint . Some days I make him crow himself hoarse , just to remind him who 's boss ; but on this particular morning , my eyes were open as soon as Jake hit the stairs . The room where I slept  --  where the body slept  --  was in a renovated Victorian in Autumn Creek , Washington , twenty-five miles east of Seattle . The Victorian belonged to Mrs. Alice Winslow , who had first taken my father on as a boarder back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first floor . The space was large but cluttered , clutter being an inevitable side effect of multiplicity , even if you make an effort to keep real-world possessions to a minimum . Just lying there in bed , and without even turning my head , I could see : Aunt Sam 's easel , brushes , and paints , and two blank canvases ; Adam 's skateboard ; Jake 's stuffed panda ; Seferis 's kendo sword ; my books ; my father 's books ; Jake 's little shelf of books ; Adam 's Playboy collection ; Aunt Sam 's stack of art prints ; a color television with remote that used to be my father 's but now belonged to me ; a VCR that was three-fifths mine , three-tenths Adam 's , and one-tenth Jake 's ( long story ) ; a CD player that was one-half mine , one-quarter my father 's , one-eighth Aunt Sam 's , and one-sixteenth apiece Adam 's and Jake 's ( longer story ) ; a rack of CDs and videotapes of various ownerships ; and a wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to , but was mostly mine . That 's what I could see without even looking around ; and besides the bedroom , there was a sitting room , a big walk-in closet , a full bathroom that was full in more ways than one , and the kitchen that we shared with Mrs. Winslow . The kitchen was n't so cluttered , though ; Mrs. Winslow cooked most of our meals for us , and strictly limited our personal food storage to one shelf in the refrigerator and two shelves in the pantry . I got us out of bed and into the bathroom to start the morning ritual . Teeth came first . Jake really enjoys brushing for some reason , so I let him do it , stepping back into the pulpit and giving him the body . I stayed alert . Jake , as I 've mentioned , is a child ; but Andy Gage 's body is adult and five-foot-seven , and hangs on Jake 's soul like a suit of clothes many sizes too big . He moves clumsily in it , and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ; and as we 've only got the one skull between us , if he bends over to get a dropped toothpaste cap and bashes his head on the corner of the sink , it is a group tragedy . So I kept a close eye on him . This morning there were no accidents . He did his usual thorough job of brushing : side to side , up and down , getting every tooth , even the tricky ones in back . I wish he could handle the flossing as well , but that 's a little too dexterous for him . I took the body back and had a quick squat on the toilet . This is my job most mornings , though my father occasionally asks to do it  --  the pleasure of a good shit , he says , being one of the few things he misses from outside . Adam also volunteers sometimes , usually just after the latest Playboy has arrived ; but I generally do n't indulge him more than once or twice a month , as it upsets the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bath mat beside the tub and let Seferis run through his routine : two hundred sit-ups followed by two hundred push-ups , the last hundred evenly divided between the right and left arms . I came back from the pulpit to muscle burn and a lather of sweat , but I did n't complain . The body 's stomach is as flat as a washboard , and I can lift heavy things . Next I gave Adam and Aunt Sam two minutes each under the shower , starting with Aunt Sam . They used to alternate who went first , but Aunt Sam likes the water a lot warmer than Adam does , and Adam was always forgetting to adjust the temperature control ...
