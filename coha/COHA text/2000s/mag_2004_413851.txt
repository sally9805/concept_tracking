IN the fashionable world of arts and entertainment , there are social butterflies , those well-heeled souls who know all the right people and get invited to all the right parties , and then there are those VIP-ticket-holding , platinum-card-carrying , red-carpet-walking types who represent the very essence of the " in " crowd . Photograph The Spencer family of New Jersey includes ( clockwise ) Jameel , Jamani , Geraldine ( Nannie ) Brooks ( the grandmother ) , Nia ( seated ) and Cheryl . // The Spencer family of New Jersey are definitely red-carpet types . Jameel Hasaan Spencer is president of Blue Flame Marketing and Advertising and chief marketing officer for Bad Boy Worldwide ( P. Diddy Combs ' multimillion-dollar corporation ) . His wife , Cheryl , a freelance photographer , owns a Rolodex filled with the names and numbers of celebrities whom she considers close friends . And even the Spencer children have high-profile gigs-7-year-old Jamani and his 5-year-old sister Nia are both Ford models and have appeared in major advertising campaigns . Jameel says that his family represents the new wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus are expected to enjoy the social lifestyle of the young , rich and famous . " This lifestyle is the new urban economy where we 're making a lot more money than our parents made , " Jameel explains . " And we really represent the hip-hop economy , the companies that are on the peripheral of the culture of hiphop . " Cheryl agrees . " I was a publicist for 15 years in the entertainment industry , so I 'm still very social , " she laughs . " I attend many different events-it could be a premiere , or one of the many parties that Jameel does with Puff Sean Combs , but there 's always something going on . " Photograph During special time at home , Cheryl gives her daughter Nia tips about photography . " She 's learning a lot more at home . I believe that the primary learning place is at home , " she says . " Ultimately , I have to take responsibility for teaching my children . " // But the Spencers want to make one thing abundantly clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always come first . And despite all the pomp and circumstance that their social lives entail , the Spencers ' daily grind is very similar to that of the typical working Black family . " I wake up around 6:30 a.m. , get myself dressed and then I get the kids up , fix breakfast , get them dressed and ready for school , " Cheryl says . " Once they 're ready , Jameel joins us and we take them to school together . " Afterwards , the couple heads to the gym to work out ( with separate personal trainers ) . Back at home , Cheryl prepares a steak-and-egg breakfast for her husband before he heads off to work . During the day Cheryl runs business-related errands in the city , and in the afternoon she picks the children up from school . After school is when the home-schooling session begins . " I believe that your primary learning place is at home , " Cheryl says . " I have to take responsibility for their education . I just ca n't expect a new person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them everything they should know . " Every evening , after the children complete their homework assignments , Cheryl provides what she calls " mommy work , " additional homework that emphasizes what they learned in school . " I buy workbooks based on what they 're learning in school , " she says . " I give them homework as well , and when they do well they will receive stars and stickers on my homework chart . When they complete one of the workbooks they get rewarded-we can go to the store and pick out whatever they want . " Currently , Nia is keeping pace with her kindergarten studies , learning her colors , numbers and the alphabet . Jamani , who is in second grade , is reading and doing simple math . After school Jamani plays baseball , football and basketball , and is learning to play the guitar . As Cheryl is preparing the children for the evening , her husband Jameel is still hard at work . On any given day , Jameel is pitching advertising campaigns , hosting conference calls or spearheading presentations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the West Coast , which means that he needs to stick around the office until the close of their business day . Late-night business dinners are also a part of Jameel 's routine , as he often hosts clients or potential clients after his office work is done . But no matter how long his workday extends , Jameel and Cheryl take the children to school every morning , together . " You have to make time for your children . You have to treat parenting as the most important job in your life , " Jameel says . " When I go on business trips , I 'm the type of person who goes to L.A. for the day . I take the first flight in the morning and get on the red-eye coming back home . You have to make all kinds of sacrifices , and put all kinds of demands on your body in order to make sure that you have enough time to be a good father .

Photograph Father and son routinely set aside time to bond . The Spencer family ( below ) enjoys a board game ; they go bowling on the weekends . // " It was really different for me because my parents were divorced 14 months after I was born , so I did n't really grow up with a father , " Jameel says . " So I knew that once I did have a family , I was going to be a part of my kids ' life , no matter what . We all go bowling together and I 'm involved with every sport that Jamani 's involved with , and I coach basketball . Whatever he wants to do , I 'm going to be really supportive of him . " Jameel and Cheryl both volunteer reading to their children 's class once a month , and Cheryl is vying to have an even greater presence in her son 's classroom . " Jameel and I are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need anything , we 'll volunteer to help , " she says . " But I 'm really trying to become class mother because that 's the parent who has the most power ! " The Spencers pride themselves on the sacrifices that they 've made to nurture well-rounded children . And although the well-connected couple consider themselves privileged in every way imaginable , they 've been very careful not to let their family 's needs get washed up in the trappings of money , privilege and access to stardom . " I 'm a very career-minded person and I would be moving and shaking if I did n't have my little ones , " Cheryl says . " But I do n't think my purpose for bringing them here is to drop them off for someone else to raise . The honest part is that no one else is going to love your children like you do . " And Jameel says that the extra effort that he makes to spend time with his children is paying off in a big way , as evidenced by a recent conversation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son what he wants to be when he gets older , my son will tell you that he wants to OWN his own barbershop or hotel , " Jameel exclaims . " His whole concept of having a job is ownership . As a 35-year-old Black man , I think that 's revolutionary . " <p>
