" Surprise ! " Kyla beamed as her startled husband jumped back . Friends shouted their greetings from the restaurant tables adorned with silver and black " Over-the-Hill " balloons . " I do n't believe this ! " Jefferson grinned . He grabbed Kyla around her waist and hugged her close . Kyla 's skin tingled at his touch . After many years , he still turned her on . " We got you , did n't we ? " " That 's for sure . I ca n't believe this . " " Happy birthday , darling ! " Cheers echoed through the restaurant again as Jefferson kissed Kyla . They lingered in the embrace and the crowd applauded . " Hey , hey Dr. Jefferson ! " A voice from the crowd interrupted their moment . " There 's no room for that here , Ky . Dr. Jefferson has to be shared with everyone , " Jasmine , Kyla 's best friend , scolded playfully . Laughter filled the room as Jasmine wiggled and nudged herself between Kyla and Jefferson . Standing on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your birthday I know you 'll never forget . " She kissed him , full on the lips . As friends pushed Jasmine aside to offer their congratulatory wishes , Kyla frowned and remembered her husband 's recent complaints about Jasmine . Now , she wondered if she should have so lightly dismissed his concerns . Taking his hand a bit too firmly , Kyla moved alongside her husband , past a smiling Jasmine as Stevie Wonder blasted birthday wishes from speakers around the elegantly decorated room . After a few body-crushing minutes , Kyla loosened her grip and allowed Jefferson to be pulled further into the crowd . He caught her eyeand reluctantly let her fingers slide from his . Kyla leaned against the restaurant 's blue-suede wall and her eyes roamed through the crowd of the ninety invited guests , personal friends as well as colleagues , present to celebrate the fortieth birthday of her husband , a well-respected pulmonary specialist . Kyla took a glass of sparkling cider from a passing tuxedoed waiter , then moved to a table , away from the swell of guests . Watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw him stride confidently through the maze of tables on his mission to greet every guest . She was content to watch it all from the sidelines . " Thank you , Lord , " she whispered as her eyes continued to follow Jefferson . " Thank you for giving me sixteen wonderful years with this man . " " Girl , things are heating up in here , " Jasmine said , interrupting Kyla 's prayer as she bounced down into a chair . Kyla 's eyes swept over Jasmine in her red knit , hip-squeezing minidress and , although it was a little too short for her taste , she had to admit that Jasmine did look good . Jasmine fanned her face , then took Kyla 's glass and sipped her cider before Kyla could protest . Kyla got another glass from a passing waiter and crinkled her nose as the cider 's bubbles rose and tickled her . She fixed her eyes on the couples on the dance floor , doing her best to ignore Jasmine and the feelings of anger she felt brewing inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , it looks like it 's going to be the party of the century , Ky . " Jasmine 's tone belied her words . " At least the party of the week . " " Well , I 'm not as important as you and Jefferson . I do n't get invited to all those posh affairs . It 's the first time I 've been to a p-a-r-t-y since my separation . " Kyla 's light brown eyes softened . " Are you okay ? You know you can talk to me . " " Nothing to talk about . I 'm fine , look at me . " Jasmine made a sweeping gesture with her hand across her body . " Do I look like I 'm suffering ? " Kyla smiled . " Jas , you look great . " " Yeah , The Commodores called it a brick house . And to think in a little while I 'll be forty . " Kyla laughed . " What 's so funny ? " Jasmine smirked . " Remember , two weeks after I hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But , we still look good , girl . " They laughed together . " We do , do n't we ? " But a second later , Jasmine 's smile slid away . " I just hope someone else will notice . " " Do n't force it , sweetie . It might be a little too soon for you to get involved with anyone . " " Easy for you to say . You have a man . " Kyla reached over and squeezed her friend 's hand . " I 'm just trying to pass on some good advice . " " How can you give me advice on something you do n't know anything about ? All you know is perfection and I do n't feel like being perfect right now . " " I 'm not perfect , Jas . " " Umph . You 're as close as any human being on earth will ever be . Just ask my father , my sister , anyone we know , they 'll tell you ! " Her words sounded bitter . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone , except for Jefferson , so you know my laundry stinks just like everybody else 's . " Jasmine could n't suppress a laugh . Kyla half smiled . " I just want you to be okay . " " I 'm fine . " Jasmine sighed . " I 'm not going to sit here and talk all night when all of these fine men are waiting for me . " Kyla 's eyes followed Jasmine as she sashayed across the room . She shook her head . But right now , she did n't have time to worry about Jasmine . Standing , Kyla edged towards the crowd , knowing it was just as important for her to meet and greet the guests as it was for Jefferson . She moved shyly along the perimeter of the room , watching as the waiters bustled around , clicking glasses , making sure none were ever empty and plates were never bare . The guests gathered in clusters and the conversation and laughter mixed with the music to form a melodic hum that floated through the air . Stepping forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmly with each person , spending a little extra time with the guests she knew might later become benefactors of the Medical Center . As she continued her stroll , Kyla was embraced and kissed at every turn as if it were her birthday . She picked hot hors d'oeuvres from the trays and , with a fixed smile , searched for Jefferson , finally spotting him at a table with a few of the other doctors . As if on cue , Jefferson turned and looked directly at her with a twinkle in his eye . Heat rushed to her face and Kyla instantly thanked God their nine-year-old daughter , Nicole , was spending the weekend in San Diego with Jefferson 's mother . She turned away , afraid that others at the party would be able to discern their telepathic messages . Jefferson 's gaze fortified her and she continued her stroll , pausing at the stage that had been set for the DJ . " The music is great . " She smiled at the DJ as Marvin Gaye crooned " What 's Goin ' On . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance floor . Jasmine was in the middle , with her arms high above her head as she cha-cha'ed with Ian Hollis , the accountant for the Medical Center , who was swaying more like an exotic dancer than a numbers cruncher . As the crowd cheered and Marvin continued to ask about picket lines and brutality , Jasmine 's hips swiveled deeply . " I had a feeling you 'd like the old school theme . " The DJ 's words snapped Kyla back . Turning away from the dance floor spectacle , Kyla chuckled . " I ca n't imagine music that I love is considered old . " He laughed . " I know how you feel ! " With an audible sigh , she shook her head . It seemed like a short time ago , but almost twenty years had passed since she had met Jefferson at Hampton Institute . Only five minutes after they had met , Jefferson had proposed to her . The memory of that night was still so clear . She had wandered out from the Kappa Alpha Psi party , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed with students celebrating the completion of finals . She was squinting through the dim streetlights when a tall , mocha-skinned brother dressed in red and white fraternity paraphernalia swaggered towards her . " Some party , huh ? " the man with the huge Afro said , as he sloped against the wall . Kyla nodded and smiled . " A little hot though . " " I like hot things , " he said with a half-smile . Ignoring his innuendo , Kyla walked across the wooden porch and perched against the rail . He followed and leaned on the fence , facing her . " My name is Jefferson , by the way . " " Nice to meet you . " She extended her hand and waited as he switched the Budweiser can from his right hand to his left . " The pleasure is definitely all mine ... " he answered as he took her hand . When Kyla remained silent , he continued . " So , are you a student here ? I have n't noticed you before . " " I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands along her corduroy jeans . The smooth voices of the Ohio Players blasted through the opened windows and Kyla snapped her fingers . " Fire ! Fire ! " Jefferson sang , as his eyes danced with the music . " Fire ! The way you walk and talk really sets me off to a full alarm ... " " It was nice meeting you , Jefferson , " she said and started back towards the house . " " Wait , we have n't finished yet . " " Have n't finished what ? " " Making all of our plans . You 're gon na be my wife , " he said as he brought the beer can to his lips . " You do n't even know my name , " she chuckled . " Okay , wife , tell me your name . " She stepped closer so that she could see his face clearly through the streetlights and spoke with a smile . " Kyla . Kyla Carrington . " " That 's all I need to know . Everything else I 'll learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said as his hand traveled gently down the sleeve of her polyester blouse , until his fingers laced through hers . Her eyes blinked with surprise , but she kept her hand in his . " So , Jefferson . If we 're going to be married , do n't you think I should know your last name ? " " Does that mean you will marry me ? " They shared their first laugh together in a scene not too different from this one . " Hey , girl , " a voice came over her shoulder . " I saw you over there talking to that Jasmine person . I was going to rescue you , but decided it would serve you right to be stuck with her all night . " " Now , Alexis . You promised you would behave , " she said hugging her friend . " I am behaving . " Alexis raised her thick eyebrows , feigning innocence . She paused , lowering her voice conspiratorially . " If I was n't I would tell Jasmine that her dress is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Stop it , " Kyla said trying to hold her laugh . " Pastor says , ' Tell the truth and shame the devil , ' " Alexis drawled as she held up one hand as if she was about to shout Hallelujah . " Anyway , sorry I 'm late . Things were crazy at work . Was Jefferson surprised ? " " I think he was stunned . " " No problem getting him here ? " " That was the easy part . You know how much he loves this place . " " You worked it , Ky , " Alexis said as she reached for one of the black balloons that floated above her . " Memphis restaurant has never looked better . Louise did this , right ? " " Of course . " " She 's the best in L.A. She used to cater everything for my office , but recently , she 's been hard to get . Hollywood has been calling her . " " I was n't about to try to do this without Louise . But enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand and pulling her into the corner . " There are a lot of good-looking , single , successful men here . " " Kyla ... " Alexis whined . " Now , I 'm not trying to set you up or anything . " Alexis raised her eyebrows in doubt . " I just want you to know ... you have options here . " " That 's a new way of putting it . " " I just want you to be happy . " " I am happy . I do n't need a man for that . " " But ... " " Kyla ! " Alexis interrupted before her friend could continue . " Not everyone is going to find her Prince Charming , have the perfect child and wake up sixteen years later just as much in love as the day she married . That only happens in fairy tales and at your house . " " Well , you never know who you 'll meet . " Alexis closed her eyes , slightly irritated , and tilted her head toward the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep this chile out of my love life ! " " What are you two over here conspiring about ? " Jasmine wiped her sweaty face , then tugged at her dress , trying to smooth it down over her hips . " Hello , Alexis , " Jasmine said in a slow drawl , imitating Alexis ' southern accent . " Hello , Jasmine , " Alexis said curtly . " Anyway , Kyla , " Alexis continued , turning her back to Jasmine . " How are things going with the expansion at the clinic ? " " Great . The final proposal goes in next week . " " Does that mean they 're going ahead with it ? " Jasmine asked , leaning forward so that she could be heard . " Uh-huh . Can you believe it ? " " Of course ! " Alexis said . " As hard as you guys work , you deserve it . " " Yeah , just what you need more success , " Jasmine whispered and rolled her eyes . " Hey , you , " Jefferson appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't danced all night . " As they stood in the center of the dance floor , Jefferson wrapped his arms around Kyla and they swayed to Lionel Richie 's sexy voice . " Zoom ! I 'd like to fly away ! " Jefferson sang softly into her ear . " Umm , " Kyla sighed and leaned in closer . Jefferson brushed her thick bangs from her face and kissed her forehead . " Kyla , I ca n't believe you did this for me . Thank you . " He leaned over and brushed his lips against hers , then pulled her tighter . As Jefferson sang Lionel 's words into her ear , Kyla knew this would be one of the best nights of her life . * * * " Louise , you outdid yourself this time , lady , " Kyla exclaimed as she signed her name with a flourish and handed the check to the caterer . " I 'm glad you 're happy . I have n't done many private parties since I opened the Pie Shoppe . But how could I refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift for him . I could n't remember which was his favorite , so I baked two things a pecan sweet potato pie and a pineapple cheesecake . They 're in the kitchen . " " No , you did n't ! " Louise laughed . " I know his sweet tooth . " " He 'll think he 's walking around in heaven ! Thank you ! " As she hugged Louise , she glanced around the empty room . " Jefferson 's out front with some of the guys , " Alexis said reading her friend 's expression as she sat down at the table . " I just saw him . Kyla , this was a great party . " " I was just thanking Louise for everything . So , did you ... meet anyone ? " Alexis rolled her eyes and ignored the question . " Anyway ... how have things been with you , Louise ? " Louise laughed . " Great . I 've been busy . In fact , I have a wedding to do tomorrow , so I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Kyla . " Tell Jefferson I said enjoy the rest of his birthday . " Kyla remained silent until Louise left the room , then scooted her chair closer to Alexis , but before she could say anything , she heard Jasmine 's voice . " Still here , Alexis ? " Kyla glanced up and saw Jefferson and Jasmine walking towards them . " Hey , you , " Jefferson took Kyla 's hand and pulled her to him . " Honey , everyone is raving about this party . " " It was all Louise . She left you a special surprise and said to tell you to enjoy the rest of your birthday . " Kyla brushed her lips against his neck , drinking in his scent . " I want you to enjoy the rest of your birthday , too . " " Well ... I guess that 's my cue . I 'm out of here . " Alexis stood , readying herself to go , and glared at Jasmine when she did n't do the same . " Hey , Alexis , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great time together . He 's a good brother . " " Brian ! " Kyla said , opening her eyes wide . " What about Brian ? " Jasmine asked . She hoped they were n't talking about Brian Lewis , the doctor who had just joined the Medical Center . Jasmine had spent quite a bit of time tonight trying to get his attention , but he had n't shown any interest in her . Now , she hoped that they were n't talking about Alexis getting together with him . That would be a dire end to this dismal evening . " Jefferson , do n't say another word ! " Alexis commanded , softening her words with a smile . " You know how your wife is . " " Sorry . I was only passing along some information . " " But Alex , we can help . Jefferson has known him since they were kids , right , honey ? " " Leave me out of this . I do n't want Alex killing me . " " You 're a smart man , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jasmine piped in again . " Like I said , I 'm outta here . " Alexis hugged Kyla and Jefferson . " Happy birthday , again . I 'll call you tomorrow , Ky . " Alexis looked over her shoulder . " Are n't you coming , Jasmine ? " " I was hoping that Jefferson and Kyla could drop me home . " " I think they want to be alone , " Alexis said stating what she thought was obvious . " Where 's your car ? " Jasmine grimaced at Alexis ' cutting tone . " I came with some friends . Not that it 's any of your business , " she snapped . " Ky , would you mind giving me a ride ? " " No ! " Alexis interjected before Kyla could answer . " I 'll take you home . " " Alex , that would be great ! " Jefferson exclaimed . " I do want some time with this beautiful lady , " he said pulling Kyla closer . " I want to thank her and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson kissed Kyla as if the two of them were already alone . Jasmine grabbed her jacket from the table and stomped out . Alexis followed , leaving Jefferson and Kyla totally unaware of anything that was happening around them .
