So much to do , so little time . And it does n't help that the guy down the hall is always dropping by your cubicle to share unsolicited lawn-care tips . Then there are the phone , the e-mail , the micromanaging boss to deal with . On a typical day office workers are interrupted about seven times an hour , which adds up to 56 interruptions a day , 80% of which are considered trivial , according to time-management experts . " We pride ourselves on being multitaskers , but the truth is , we 're functioning at a state of partial attention , " says John White , international program director with Priority Management , a training company based in Vancouver , Canada . " Because of constant interruptions , our memory , follow-up ability , flexibility and quality of work start to erode . " <P> That is , quite frankly , a real waste of time . U.S. productivity growth is slowing , and companies have just about maxed out on efficiency gains to be had through layoffs and employee buyouts . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity is  --  as wacky as it sounds  --  enabling folks to be more productive . <P> Some of the techniques are surprisingly low tech . At Pitt Ohio Express , a trucking company based in Pittsburgh , Pa. , claims auditors take turns wearing a special black baseball cap to signal that they are absorbed in a project . Department head Lois Beggs says she takes several hours " under the cap " to catch up on her 150 emails a day when she has been away from the office . At Quarasan , an educational-product developer in Chicago , workers take " focus blocks " of up to three hours when they absolutely can not be interrupted . " They know they do n't have to jump when someone comes to their desk or have a Pavlovian response when the phone rings , " says president Randi Brill . In any week , about 25% of the staff use the technique . Signs hang on cubicles , chairs or doors with such declarations as I AM FEELING TOTALLY FOCUSED RIGHT NOW . PLEASE RESPECT THIS PROCESS . <P> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers on task . CubeDoors  --  portable , retractable , mesh-weave panels from CubeSmart in Fort Worth , Texas  --  block entry into cubicles , effectively saying " Busy " to would-be interlopers . In 2003 the company sold 1,500 " doors , " which cost $30 each . Sales are up 300% this year . New on the market last year : the Quiet Technology sound-masking system from office-furniture maker Herman Miller . Designed for open-layout work environments , the system renders speech beyond a 12-ft. to 16-ft. radius unintelligible with " pink noise " technology embedded in the furniture . To a user , it sounds like gentle whooshing . What it does is match the frequencies of human speech to make colleagues ' chatter less distracting . The cost of creating such quiet zones : 75 per sq . ft. , about half that of conventional sound-reduction systems , says product manager Amy Sremba . <P> And while online communications are often a time-stealing culprit , some companies are finding relief in them . All the employees at Basex , an information-technology research firm in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT DISTURB status signals that coworkers should n't phone , email or stop by to chat . " There was never a memo on it . We all just started using the technology , " says CEO Jonathan Spira . Finding peace and quiet should always be so easy .
