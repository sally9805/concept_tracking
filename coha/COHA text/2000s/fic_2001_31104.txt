Uncle Seth was firmly convinced that bad things mostly happen on cloudy days . " A thunderhead or two do n't hurt , but too much cloudy weather makes people restless and mean , females particularly , " he remarked , as we were walking down to the Missouri River . " They do n't make Ma mean , she 's mean anyway , " G.T. said  --  he had acquired the habit of contradiction , as Uncle Seth liked to put it . G.T. could usually be counted on to do the unexpected : only yesterday he jumped up and stabbed Granpa Crackenthorpe in the leg with a pocketknife , probably because he got tired of hearing Granpa complain about the food . The knife did n't go in very far , but even so , Granpa 's pallet looked as if a shoat had been butchered on it . G.T. ran away and hid in the thicket , but Ma gave him a good thrashing anyway , when he finally came in . Quick tempered as he was , G.T. was still scared of the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret , " Uncle Seth allowed . " You just need to walk a little smaller on cloudy days . " The three of us had strolled down to the river in hopes that we could catch or trap or shoot something Ma could cook  --  something with a good taste to it , if possible . We had been living on old dry mush for about three weeks , which is why Granpa complained . I had a fishing pole , G.T. had a wire-mesh crawdad trap , and Uncle Seth had his Sharps rifle , which he kept in an oilcloth sheath , never allowing a drop of rain to touch it . He had been a Union sharpshooter in the war between the states and could regularly pop a turtle in the head at seventy-five yards , a skill but not a useful skill , because the turtles he popped always sank . If anybody got to eat them , it was only other turtles . The clouds hung low and heavy over the big muddy river that day ; they were as dull colored as felt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause Uncle Seth to dwell on calamities he had experienced in the past . " It was nearly this cloudy that day in Richmond when I tripped over that goddamn wagon tongue and shot off half my kneecap , " he reminded us . " If the sun had been shining I would have been alert enough to step over that wagon tongue . It was the day after the war ended . I had no need of a rifle , but that gloomy weather made me fearful . I got it in my head that there might be a Reb or two in the neighborhood  --  a Reb who had n't heard the good news . " " If the war had just been over one day , then there might have been , " I said . It seemed reasonable to me . " Son , there was n't a Reb within thirty-five miles of us that day , " Uncle Seth said . " I could have left my rifle in the tent , but I did n't , and the upshot of it is that I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.T. had just eased his crawdad trap into the water , near the muddy shore . " If you 'd shut up I might catch some crawdads , " he said . " Why , crawdads ca n't hear , " Uncle Seth said . " You sass your elders too much , G.T. A boy that starts off sassing his elders is apt to end up on the wrong end of a hang rope  --  at best you can look forward to a long stretch in the territorial prison . " He was a tall , fidgety man , Uncle Seth . No part of him was ever really still  --  not unless he was dead drunk , a not unusual condition for him . Pa said there was a time when Seth Cecil could walk faster and keep walking longer than any man on the plains ; of course , that was before the accident , when Pa and Uncle Seth were partners in the freighting business , hauling goods from the Missouri River to the forts up in the north . Even now , with half a kneecap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could still manage a pretty long stride , if he had some reason to be in a hurry  --  it irked him that Pa , who was his younger brother , made him a stay-at-home partner , rather than letting him go upriver with the freight . I think it irked him so much that he and Pa might have come to blows , if Ma had n't made it plain that she would only tolerate so much , when it came to family quarrels . " I can still drive a wagon , you know , Dickie , " Uncle Seth pointed out , the last time Pa was home . " Hauling freight ai n't that complicated . " " I know you can manage a wagon , but could you outrun a Blackfoot Indian , if it came to a footrace ? " Pa asked . " I doubt you could even outrun a Potawatomi , if it was a long footrace . " " Why would I need to outrun a Potawatomi , or a Blackfoot either ? " Uncle Seth asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them closed in on me , but then , so would you . " G.T. did n't really have the patience to be a good crawdad fisherman . Ten minutes was all he gave it before pulling his trap out . It held one crawdad  --  not a very large one . " One crawdad wo n't go far , " he said . " I expect there are a million crawdads in the Missouri River , and here I ai n't caught but one . " " They ai n't in the river , they 're in that slimy mud , " Uncle Seth pointed out  --  it was just then that we heard a gunshot from the direction of the house . " That was a rifle shot , " Uncle Seth said . " I expect Mary Margaret finally drew a bead on that big bobcat that 's been snatching her chickens . " " You 're wrong again , " G.T. said , pointing toward the house . " Sis would n't be running that fast if it was just a bobcat . " G.T. did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the trail . Neva was only fourteen but she had been long legged enough to outrun anybody in the family  --  even Pa  --  for the last two or three years . When our smokehouse caught on fire Neva ran all the way into Boone 's Lick before any of us could even find a bucket , and was soon back with a passel of drunks willing to try and put the fire out . Fortunately , it was n't much of a fire  --  all we lost was an old churn somebody had left in the smokehouse . Still , everybody who saw Neva go flying down the road that day talked about her run for years  --  some even wanted to take her to St. Louis and enter her in a footrace , but that plan fell through . " Who do they think they 're going to find in St. Louis who wants to run a footrace with a little girl from Boone 's Lick ? " Uncle Seth asked at the time , a question that stumped the town . This time Neva arrived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in air for a while before she could talk . " She 's outrun her own voice , " G.T. said . He was slow of foot himself , and very impressed by Neva 's speed . " Easy girl , easy girl , " Uncle Seth said , as if he was talking to a nervous filly . " It 's a big bunch of thieves ! " Neva gasped , finally . " They 're stealing our mules  --  ever one of our mules . " " Why , the damned ruffians ! " Uncle Seth said . A red vein popped out along the top of his nose  --  that red vein nearly always popped out when he got anxious or mad . " We heard a shot , " he said . " I hope nobody ai n't shot your Ma . " He said it in a worried voice , too . Despite what he said about women and clouds , we all knew that Uncle Seth was mighty partial to Ma . " No , it was Ma that shot , " Neva said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , " he said . " The world can spare a horse , but none of us can spare your mother . " " Gim me your rifle , I 'll go kill them all , " G.T. said , but when he tried to grab the Sharps , Uncle Seth snatched it back . He looked downriver for a moment . Boone 's Lick was only half a mile away . He seemed to be trying to decide who to send for help , Neva or me . G.T. had already started for the house , with his crawdad trap and his one crawdad . G.T. was n't about to give up his one crawdad . " Honey , when you catch your breath maybe you ought to run on down to Boone 's Lick and bring Sheriff Stone back with you , " Uncle Seth said . " It 's the sheriff 's job to deal with horse theft , and mule theft too . " " I do n't need to bring the sheriff , because he 's already there , " Neva said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh-oh . Where was Sheriff Stone at the time ? " Uncle Seth asked . " Sitting on his horse , " Neva said , in a tone that suggested she considered it a pretty stupid question . " It fell over when Ma shot it and nearly mashed his leg . " Uncle Seth absorbed this information calmly . If he was surprised , he did n't show it . " Oh , I see , honey , " he said . " It 's Baldy Stone that 's stealing our mules . I guess that 's just the kind of law you have to expect in Missouri . Let 's go wade into them , Shay . " I was surprised that Ma had shot the sheriff 's horse , but my opinion was n't asked . " Do you still want me to go to Boone 's Lick ? " Neva asked , as Uncle Seth and I started for the house . " Why , no , honey  --  no reason to run your legs off , " Uncle Seth said . " The law 's already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were to go to Boone 's Lick ? " " Wild Bill Hickok , " Neva said  --  it was clear she had already thought the matter out . " He 's usually in the saloon , " she added . I saw right then , from the look on her face , that she intended to go see Wild Bill , whatever Uncle Seth advised . Neva might be young , but she had Ma 's determination , and there were not many people , young or old , male or female , with more determination than Ma . " I 'm impressed by your steady thinking , honey , " Uncle Seth said . " Bill could be a big help , if he was in the mood to be , but this cloudy weather might have put him off . " " You 're the only one that minds clouds , " Neva said . She had got her wind back and looked ready for a tussle . " If there were n't no clouds it would never rain , and if it did n't rain nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals would all starve , and then we 'd starve , " Neva said , giving Uncle Seth one of her cool looks . Uncle Seth did n't say anything . He saw that Neva had backed him into a pretty tight corner , where cloudy weather was concerned . G.T. was already halfway to the house , too . " A pistolero like Bill Hickok is likely to have his moods , whatever the weather , " he said . " I try not to interfere with Bill and he tries not to interfere with me . I think we better just go home and see why Baldy Stone thinks he has the right to requisition our mules . " Neva immediately started trotting down the riverbank toward Boone 's Lick . I was n't surprised , and neither was Uncle Seth . " There 's no shortage of hardheaded women in the Cecil family , " he said , mildly . " If you hit one of them in the head with a rock it would break the rock . " Our cabin was n't far from the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi River , in the Ioway country ; both of them lived by rivers until their hauling business forced them out onto the plains from time to time . Despite his gimpy knee Uncle Seth was only a step behind me when we came around the chicken yard . There was no sign of Ma , and no sign of our mules , either , but there was plenty of sign of Sheriff Baldy Stone , a short man who had grown very round in the course of his life . Sheriff Baldy was trying to unsaddle his dead horse , a large roan animal who had fallen about twenty steps from our cabin door . It was a big horse . The sheriff had the girth unbuckled but when he tried to pull the cinch out from under the horse it would n't budge . G.T. , who had beat us home by a good margin , was standing nearby , but he did n't offer to help . After tugging at the cinch several times without having any effect , Sheriff Baldy abruptly gave up and sat down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was almost as out of breath as Neva had been when she showed up down by the river . After resting for a minute , the sheriff looked up at Uncle Seth and gave a little wave  --  or it may have been a salute . The sheriff had only been a corporal in the war , whereas Uncle Seth had been a captain . " Well , Seth , she shot my horse and here I sit , " Sheriff Baldy said . " Do you realize I courted Mary Margaret once , when things were different ? " " I 've heard that rumor  --  I expect she still has a sweet spot for you , Baldy , " Uncle Seth said . " A sweet spot ? I do n't think so , " the sheriff said . " It would explain why she shot the horse and not you , " Uncle Seth pointed out . The remark struck G.T. as funny . He began to cackle , which drew a frown from the sheriff . Just then Ma came out the door , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Marcy , was cooing and blowing little spit bubbles . Ma handed her right over to Uncle Seth , at which point Marcy began to coo even louder . Pa was so busy upriver that he had n't even been home to see the baby yet  --  for all little Marcy knew , Uncle Seth was her pa , if she even knew what a pa was , at that age . " Now , Mary Margaret , " Uncle Seth said , " you ought n't to have handed me this child . There might be gunplay to come , depending on how mad Baldy is and what he 's done with our mules . " " No gunplay , no gunplay , " Sheriff Baldy said . " Getting my horse shot out from under me is violence enough for one afternoon . You can hold ten babies if you want to , Seth . " Ma walked around the dead horse , looking down at it thoughtfully . She did n't say a word , either kind or unkind , to Sheriff Baldy . When she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tested it with her fingers , to see if it might have a little fat on it , rather than just being all muscular and stringy . " Why , it is a horse . That 's a surprise , " Ma said lightly . " Of course it 's a horse , thoroughly dead ! " the sheriff said . " You shot it out from under me before I could even open my mouth to ask for the loan of your mules . What did you think it was , if not a horse ? " " An elk , " Ma said , with a kind of faraway look in her eye . " I thought it was a big fat elk , walking right up to my door . " She paused . She had lost flesh in the years of the war  --  everybody had . " I thought , no more mush , we 're going to be eating elk , " she said . " Granpa can stop complaining and I can be making a little richer milk for this baby  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sheriff Baldy sat there on the dead horse with his mouth open  --  a bug could have flown right into his mouth , if one had been nearby . " You mean you did n't shoot it because we were borrowing the mules ? " he asked . " I was going to explain why we needed the mules , but you did n't give me time . You stepped out the door and the next thing I knew this horse was dead . " Ma made no reply  --  she just tested the rump in another place with her fingers . Baby Marcy was still bubbling and cooing . " Well , I swear , Mary Margaret , " Sheriff Baldy said . " This was a big roan horse . How could you get it in your head that it was an elk ? " Ma still had the faraway look in her eye . It worried me when she got that look , though I could n't really have said what it was I was worried about . I think it must have worried the sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see straight , Eddie , " she said , calling Sheriff Baldy by his first name . At least I guess it was his first name . I had never heard anyone use it before . " I 'm hungry and my family 's hungry , " Ma went on . " Horse meat 's not as tasty as elk , but it will do . Whatever I owe you we can put toward the rent of the mules . " She started for the house , but the look on the sheriff 's face must have made her feel a little sorry for him , because she turned at the cabin door and looked back at him for a moment . " We 've got a little buttermilk to spare , Eddie , if you 'd like some , " she said , as she opened the door . " I 'll take the buttermilk , " Sheriff Baldy said . He got off the dead horse and we all followed Ma through the door .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
