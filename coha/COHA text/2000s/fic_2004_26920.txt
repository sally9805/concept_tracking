The Wedding Date Chapter One I blame it entirely on the pressure of work , but for the next couple of weeks Dominic and I were still officially an item at the bottom of my in-tray . Every time it rose to the surface , saying , " Well ? " I told it to bugger off , I was far too busy and important to deal with it just now . It finally caught up with me on a Sunday morning , nineteen and a half days before the wedding . Having him dump me would obviously have been the simplest way out , but that would n't keep anybody 's end up , least of all mine . I suppose I 'd been hoping my imaginative autopilot would suddenly whack me on the head with a brilliant way out , but since " Abduction by Aliens " was all it had managed , I was still dithering over alternatives . These consisted of a ) giving him the elbow , and b ) plan B , which I still had n't thought of . Nobody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still asleep , and although a vaguely human body was sprawled on the sofa , it was absorbed in the football pages and therefore suffering from TMD , aka Temporary Male Deafness . The headline said , USELESS TOSSERS or something equally rude . This was nothing to what Ace had said the previous evening , when his beloved Tossers United had been thrashed three-nil by Thessalonika Under-Thirteen Girls , or whoever it was they were supposed to have thrashed . Ace was Alix 's " little " brother , though at five foot eleven he 'd overtaken her by five inches . He was twentysix , quite nice looking under the scruff , and his light brown ponytail was usually in vibrant condition , thanks to my Pantene 2-in-1 , which he pinched constantly.With it he wore one gold earring and , except when Tossers had screwed up , a chilled-out air I defy anyone to beat . " You might make some suggestion , even if it 's completely brainless , " I muttered . " You could at least show willing . " Not so much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input , I looked out of the window for something to be irritated with besides myself , for having got into this mess in the first place . For once , there was n't even a crisp packet dancing in the breeze . Just occasionally this corner of southwest London could look quite passable . After a thirty-second time lapse , he uttered , " I 'd make him a perv , if I were you.Tell your mum you went round one night and found him poncing around in high heels and one of your bras , all upset because he could n't find enough socks to stuff it with . " " Dominic 's not like you , " I said testily . " He does n't have to hunt under the bed every morning for any two putrid socks that have n't actually walked to the washing machine by themselves . He 's got whole drawersful , all neatly rolled up and color-coded . " In fact , he was such a perfect , tidy , organized pain , a knife in the guts would have been no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little toad was grinning his face off . " What if he suddenly asked you to do the Miss Bumwhack bit ? " He put on a lecherous , gasp-and-pant voice . " I 've been a really , really bad boy  --  I was playing with my winkle all night  --  ' " " For God 's sake , he 'd never call it a winkle . Anyway , I refuse to have a relationship with a perv . " " Suit yourself . Sling me a couple of those chocolate fingers , will you ? " I slung . There were four left in the packet on the coffee table . Four , and I 'd bought them only an hour previously , while picking up the papers at the Pop-In News ' n ' Grocery round the corner . He bit half off both of them and continued with his mouth full . " Your mum was bound to resort to emotional blackmail in the end . It 's a mum 's favorite weapon , and if you have n't sussed that out by now , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , I could almost have written a learned paper on Emotional Blackmail , Maternal Variety of . Well before phoning home an hour and a half previously I 'd been psyching myself up for a hefty dose of precisely that . The conversation had gone roughly like this : " I 'm terribly sorry , Mum , but I do n't think Dominic 's going to be able to make it , after all . " " Oh , Sophy , really ! I knew you 'd let me down again , just when everybody 's dying to meet him . I told wretched Maggie he was almost definitely coming and you know what that woman 's like  --  do please try to persuade him . " " I really ca n't promise . He 's terribly busy . " " Nobody 's that busy , dear . " At this point her voice had taken on a plaintive note . " Sometimes I wonder whether you 're ashamed of me and Daddy . " " Mum ! " ( I did my best to produce an appalled little laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? " " Well , I ca n't help wondering , dear . Every single time you 've promised to bring him home , something 's cropped up at the last minute . I 'm sure you can persuade him if you try  --  but I really ca n't talk now  --  I 've got a million things to do  --  nobody has any idea how much organization goes into a wedding  --  I 'm worried sick about the seating plan for lunch  --  Sue and George still are n't speaking and Granny has n't a clue what 's going on  --  I hope to heaven they do n't start rowing at the table  --  you know what Sue 's like after a few drinks  --  and the florist I picked has changed hands and the new manager 's lost the order  --  I 've had to go and see her twice  --  still , must rush , and I 'm sure you can talk him around if you put your mind to it . Bye-bye , dear . " I should have expected nothing else . My mother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
