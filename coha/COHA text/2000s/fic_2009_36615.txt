Rome , Italy <p> Present Day <p> A flock of pigeons took flight as Father James Martin moved swiftly around Caligula 's obelisk , which rose up from the center of Piazza San Pietro like a colossal dagger against the steel-gray sky . Its mid-September shadow would normally have let him know that it was just past five o'clock . But for the third consecutive day , the sun remained hidden behind a shroud of lifeless clouds . Glancing over at St. Peter 's Basilica , he saw the faithful pilgrims queued for the last tour . Even a typhoon could n't scare them away , he thought . <p> He pulled his raincoat tighter to fight off a damp chill . He 'd need to move quickly to beat the imminent downpour . <p> Near the end of Via della Conciliazione , he heard a voice calling to him over the sounds of the traffic . <p> " Padre Martin ? " <p> Stopping , Martin turned . A man waved to him , splashing through the shallow puddles in quick strides . Of medium height and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and unreadable dark eyes . " Si ? " Martin replied . <p> " Sorry to bother you on your way home , " he said , planting himself at arm 's length . <p> A laminated Vatican ID badge was prominently displayed on the lapel of his raincoat , just below his white priest collar . The unfamiliar face was forgettable . Italian ? Lebanese ? Maybe thirtysomething , or perhaps a youthful fifty , Martin guessed . " Have we met ? " <p> The man shook his head . " Not yet . " <p> " What can I do for you , Father . . . ? " <p> " Fabrizio Orlando . " He extended his right hand . <p> Italian . When Martin reciprocated , he noticed that the priest 's skin was rough . Unusual for a cleric . Perhaps the man had spent time as a missionary ? The Lord 's call does n't place everyone behind a desk , Martin reminded himself . <p> " I 've just been appointed to the secretariat 's office . " <p> Why had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vatican City . " <p> " Grazie . Mind if I walk with you for a minute ? " <p> Suspicion showed in Martin 's eyes . " Not at all . " <p> The two men proceeded down the sidewalk past the cafTs and souvenir shops . <p> " I was told you 'd been Cardinal Antonio Santelli 's secretary ? " <p> " That 's right . " Martin 's gait quickened and the man kept pace beside him . <p> " Very unfortunate , His Eminence 's death . A deep loss for the Holy See . " He tightened his lips in a show of solemnity . " He was a visionary . " As they approached Piazza Pia 's busy thoroughfare , his pitch rose to compete with the bus and scooter traffic . " Many had said he would be the Holy Father 's successor . " <p> " Yes , well . . . " Attempting to echo the priest 's fond words , Martin stalled , knowing that his own remembrances would n't be nearly as complimentary . The fact remained that regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last great defender of Catholic dogma , the late cardinal had been merciless to his subordinates  --  a bulldog . Martin chose to bow his head in prayer . <p> " May God rest his soul , " Orlando said loudly as a whining Vespa sped past . <p> At the busy intersection , they remained silent to negotiate the crosswalk . <p> Martin resumed the conversation as he led the way down the cobbled walkway in front of Castel Sant'Angelo 's outer rampart . " So how can I assist you , Father ? " <p> The priest 's chin tipped up . " Yes , about business then . " A momentary stare down at the roiling Tiber helped him collect his thoughts . " The secretariat has retained my ser &shy; vices to assist in ongoing inquiries concerning the death of Dr. Giovanni Bersei . " <p> Martin stiffened . " I see . " <p> They angled onto Ponte Sant'Angelo . <p> The man went on to convey what his fact-finding mission had yielded thus far . Back in June , Italian anthropologist Giovanni Bersei had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project inside the Vatican . Only days later , Bersei had been found dead in the catacombs beneath Villa Torlonia . An elderly docent was also found dead on the premises and a routine autopsy showed he had been injected with heart-arresting toxins . Roman authorities had investigated the foul play . Santelli , too , Orlando conspiratorially reminded him , had succumbed to heart failure only a day later , though the Holy See had refused an autopsy . <p> By the time the Italian had finished , he 'd trailed Martin to within a block of his apartment building . <p> There was no doubt Orlando was well informed . But Martin was n't looking to rehash the exhaustive questioning he 'd endured in the weeks that followed the cardinal 's death . " I trust you have been informed that the carabinieri have completed their investigations ? " <p> The man 's lips pulled tight . " Mine is an internal investigation , " he repeated . <p> Approaching the narrow alley that was the shortcut to his apartment building , Martin stopped . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best for us to speak about this during business hours . After I 've obtained permission from the secretariat 's office . " <p> Orlando forced a placated smile . " I understand . " <p> " A pleasure to meet you , Father Orlando . " Martin nodded . <p> " Likewise . " <p> Martin stuffed his hands into his pockets and turned down the alley . As he was about to pass a stocky deliveryman unloading produce boxes from an idling van , he heard the priest calling after him again , quick footsteps tapping along the ancient cobblestones . <p> " Father . " <p> Stopping in his tracks , Martin 's shoulders slumped . Before he could turn to address Orlando , the anxious priest had circled in front of him . <p> " If I could just have another moment . " <p> " What is it ? " <p> Later , Martin would recall no answer . Just the priest 's eyes turning cold , slipping back to the sidewalk , then up to the windows overlooking the alleyway , and finally over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two strong hands grabbed at Martin 's coat , yanking hard , forcing his body into an uncontrolled spin , directly toward the van 's open cargo hold . <p> What in God 's name ? ! <p> A sharp blow to the knees forced him down onto the cold metal floor . " Aiuto ! " he screamed out to anyone who might hear . " Aiu  --  " <p> <br> Continues ...
