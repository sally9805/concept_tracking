In the cave , eons of time are marked in drops of water bled from stalactites . The old man guiding Phoebe is called Jean-Pierre . Short , hunched , bandy-legged , mostly toothless but still a smiler , he grabs Phoebe hard from behind , pulls her back into his chest , pointing with his penlight up into the cavern . There . Can you see ? He traces the pointer of light back and forth . A bison head wells from the rock , an arched hump , nostrils , curving horns . Phoebe can see the chisel marks where a hand enhanced the natural sculpture of the walls , giving the bison a third dimension , a muscle that propels it out of the stone , out of its fifteen thousand years of stasis . <p> Formidable , eh ? says Jean-Pierre . <p> At first Phoebe thought this was the power of the caves . The power to make still images move . Her own work is oddly similar . She runs a computerized graphics animator called a Harriet in a video house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform her clients ' products into things of magic . Cans of cat food into waltzing tunas . Aspirin into the soothing hands of a masseur . Cereal boxes into blooming jungles . The Harriet Suite is also dark and subterranean , lined with flickering banks of video monitors , twisted round the counter where Phoebe works with an electronic palette and stylus . <p> In the Musee National de la Prehistoire in Les Eyzies , Phoebe finds herself in a room filled with thirty-thousand-year-old carvings of female genitalia , wall after wall of rock lifted from the caves , imprinted with the cuneiform wedges of labia and vaginas . She 's fascinated by these female forms , so forbidden , so forgotten , here gloriously afloat on the stone like fossilized confetti . The geometry is simple : triangles for the groin , partially bisected by the short lines of the vulvae . Phoebe is struck by the artists ' clear familiarity with the subject , the minimalist renditions . Comprising the earliest known engravings from the Western world , the museum caption says . <p> Once she had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary on pornography she was doing pro bono work for . The filmmakers were lesbians who held the view that women needed to take over the business of pornography because only then they would have true control over men , emotionally and financially . Vladimir had thought this idea was bullshit . Phoebe had defended it more vigorously than she might have if Vladimir had agreed with it . Why do women want control over men ? Vladimir said . Is n't that what they 're so angry about in reverse ? Because men live in a hierarchical system , shouted Phoebe . It 's all they understand . If they 're not on the top , then they must be on the bottom . <p> Their fight had resolved itself where most did , in the bedroom , Phoebe sweating , Vladimir grunting , their anger transformed into the carnal friction that defeats all the words and all the reason of the modern brain . <p> They 've been planning this trip to France for eighteen months , since shortly after they met . Vladimir is an online video editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco . He 's Lithuanian , dark , tall , with black ringletted hair that he wears pulled back off his face in a ponytail . Phoebe first saw him at her company 's Christmas party in a rented Nob Hill mansion . He was in black tie , she in black velvet . They talked technical together over champagne : CMXs , ADOs , DVEs , Auroras , Avids , Harriets , Henrys  --  then left the party together for Julie 's Supper Club , to dance . <p> Now she 's come to France alone , at the last minute , their most recent fight proving unresolvable . Vladimir wants children . Phoebe does n't . Vladimir can wait , but Phoebe , at forty-one , ca n't . Vladimir thinks children are natural , important , fulfilling , the perfect culmination of love . Phoebe imagines sleep deprivation , self-deprivation , fun deprivation , sex deprivation . She pictures getting large and giving birth through a small orifice . In the end , Vladimir thinks , women without children are slightly pathetic . Well , fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just walking uteruses for men 's fantasies about potency . <p> The last exhibit in the Musee National de la Prehistoire in Les Eyzies is of the Venus of Laussel , a twenty-thousand-year-old bas-relief of a nude female , long-haired , with pendulous breasts hanging to her waist , huge fatty hips , and a bulbous belly . In her right hand she holds a bison horn , The earliest horn-of-plenty ? the museum 's caption wonders . Perhaps related to fertility ? <p> Once during a warm September spell when Phoebe was crammed into her workstation by an unusually large contingent of advertising people , the air-conditioning failed , then the computers , too , wiping Phoebe 's work away in a flash of darkness . The sports car she 'd transformed into a white wolf during its race along a coastal road disappeared . The vectorscopes and color wheels dissolved into gray static . Three tense hours followed during which the technicians tried to retrieve her work . The advertising people swilled coffee and paced in the atrium . Phoebe called Vladimir from the telephone in the company kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her images locked in its dark memory and never let them out again . <p> In the cave of Lascaux II ( the original was closed thirty years ago ) , Phoebe studies  --  she 's assured  --  a perfect reproduction of Ice Age art . The walls are filled with vibrant images of long dead animals . Black bulls , red deer , yellow horses , falling cows , fanciful unicorns , bison , ibex . But Phoebe finds it impossible to marvel at pigments applied in 1980 . The only wonder for her at Lascaux II is the knowledge that there 's still a Lascaux I , buried , not dead , but unborn again , its dark paintings smoldering with the life that Phoebe knows burns brightest in the absence of light . <p> During the third week of her vacation , Phoebe takes a picnic to the banks of the Vezere , under the looming cliff of the Roque SaintChristophe . The limestone scarp stretches half a mile along the river . Scores of black caves riddle its face . A dark incision runs its length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She visited the Roque a week earlier , wandered up its terraces , its hand-cut rock stairways , poked deep into its caves . She saw where Neanderthals lived in the caves seventy thousand years ago , where Cro-Magnon moved in forty-two thousand years later . <p> But this afternoon Phoebe comes simply to sit in the cool grass between the river and the cliff , to drink a bottle of wine , feel the sun , listen to the lowing of cows . A thin stream of cars and bicycles winds its way under the cliff . Tiny figures ascend the five terraces . Snatches of lectures from tour guides drift down to her in a collage of languages . <p> If she were thirty years old , Vladimir could flatter her into pregnancy . But now she finds herself defensive of her gains , her time , her money , her professional status . She pours the black Cahors wine into a jelly-jar glass , savors its sweaty scent . She does wonder about old age , about the possibility of being alone . But is it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistically , there 's little hope of saving what she has now , though she desperately wants to . Without children , Vladimir will eventually leave her . <p> A bicyclist stops on the road , pegs one leg down for support . Phoebe watches him dismount , dig through his saddle pack , pull out a camera , duck between two strands of barbed wire , and walk across the fields . Phoebe sips the wine . He turns to focus , and she can see that the cliff is too large to fit into his frame . The next time he turns , he sees Phoebe . <p> Would she take his photograph ? <p> Of course . <p> Here ? With the Roque in the background ? <p> He 's older than her , with the wiry physique of a runner . <p> Phoebe lines him up in the extreme left corner of the foreground , dwarfing him beside the megalith of the cliff . She snaps the shutter , smiles , hands him back the camera . <p> Thank you , he says , sizing her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you ? <p> Parisian . <p> San Francisco , says Phoebe . <p> Okay , he says . My favorite city besides Paris . <p> Phoebe smiles . She finds that the French are n't sure about Americans , but San Franciscans , somehow , are wonderful . <p> This is my third trip through the Dordogne , he says . This is my favorite part of France . <p> Me , too , says Phoebe . <p> Your third trip ? <p> No . Sorry . My favorite place in France . This is only my first trip . <p> She offers him wine , pours it into the second jelly-jar glass she 'd brought ( why had she done that ? ) . They stand together , looking up at the Roque . His name is Jacques . He works for Peugot , but his passion is cycling . He loves this region because of the unique scenery , the sunken valleys , the towering cliffs , the startling castles astride every bend of the river . He 's less interested in the caves . Too dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loves the big oak and chestnut trees , the meadows , the black shine of the rivers . Jacques wonders if Phoebe is traveling alone . Yes . <p> That 's unusual . <p> Perhaps not so much anymore . <p> And Jacques , is he alone ? <p> Yes , yes . He always takes one vacation alone every year . <p> Is Jacques married ? <p> Divorced . <p> Children ? Yes , he 's embarrassed to admit , six . Six ? Ridiculous , he knows , but he was young , and had two wives . <p> Is he close to his children ? <p> Of course . They 're wonderful children . The eldest almost thirty . <p> He goes back to his bicycle to fetch a little walnut cake he 'd bought from a farm near Perigeux . It 's a specialty of the region . He breaks off a piece and hands it to Phoebe . <p> She tells him about the Harriet , her work . She confides her idea about animating a scene of Ice Age cave art . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they might have appeared by firelight in the caves . <p> But you would never see the artists , she says . Only their work , appearing on the walls as if you yourself were putting it there . <p> Jacques thinks it 's a wonderful idea , quite unique . <p> If you do n't mind me asking , says Phoebe , but are you absolutely happy having had children ? She struggles with the nuance of this question in French as she refills Jacques 's wineglass . <p> Well , now , says Jacques . Of course I love my children . But to be completely honest , in a way , they were very hard on both my marriages , and they left me having to work all the time . Only now can I get any time back for myself . To bicycle , to see France . <p> Did you want children , or did your wives ? <p> With my first wife , we were young , we both wanted to be parents . With my second wife , she was younger than me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . <p> But you agreed to it ? <p> Yes . Of course . I did not feel I could deny that to a woman . It is part of the contract of marriage , n'est-ce pas ? <p> The sun slides into their eyes . <p> Were you planning to visit the Roque ? Phoebe asks . Yes , says Jacques , and her ? No , says Phoebe , she 's seen it last week . Too bad , says Jacques . Phoebe gives him a wedge of her cabecou cheese wrapped in a piece of newspaper , and he gives her a hunk of his walnut cake . They wish each other well . <p> The first time Vladimir visited Phoebe at work he 'd skulked into her video house , sheepish as a corporate spy . She 'd pulled his chair next to hers in the dusk of the Harriet Suite , run him through her video portfolio , the clips of unicorns bursting into life , of dancing teapots , of fish turning into parrots . Vladimir had nudged her out of her chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of a stick man with a stick penis running toward a stick woman with balloon breasts . Underneath he wrote : The Lithuanian Chases the Bird in Pursuit of Love . <p> In the cave of Font de Gaume , Phoebe begins to cry . She 's the lone outsider in a tour group of elderly English people . A tiny woman standing next to her digs through her purse and hands Phoebe a tissue . It is lovely , is n't it , dearie ? she says , standing alongside Phoebe and studying the painting of the reindeer . For years , says Madame Binet , their tour guide , this was believed to be a painting of a battle between two reindeer . But now we realize it is a picture of the lovemaking of two reindeer . She waves her flashlight over the contours of the animals . Here , you can see how the male is leaning over the female . And here , if you look closely , you can see how he is licking the female 's forehead . It is not a fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost tenderness . <p> Four days before Phoebe left for France , Vladimir impulsively signed up for a kayaking trip down the Kobuk River in central Alaska . Vladimir had never even been camping . His vacations tended towards quaint inns in pastoral countrysides . He looked defiant when he 'd announced the trip to Phoebe , Phoebe leaning against the kitchen counter sipping vodka . He 'd pulled himself up tall , tilted back his head . Phoebe recognized the posture : Vladimir , reclaiming his manhood . Well , shit , she thought , go ahead and throw spears for all I care . <p> He drove her to the airport for the trip to France , walked her as far as the security gate , where they 'd parted , Phoebe tearfully , then Vladimir , too , the two of them clinging and sputtering . Phoebe had felt depressed the entire flight , had sunk into her seat , using three small bottles of airline wine to ease her into a boneless stupor . The last time she 'd talked with Vladimir was by phone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train to Bordeaux . She tried to joke : maybe we could invent virtual reality children , you know , ones you could turn on and turn off at will . Vladimir had grunted . We 'll work it out , she promised . But when they hung up she knew that they were both wondering , How ? <p> Phoebe 's tour guide in the Grottes de Gargas is Yves , a French art student from the Sorbonne who 's spending the summer working on the Ice Age paintings of the Pyrenees . Few tourists make it this far south , and Yves , excited at his audience of one , is going to demonstrate for Phoebe how the paintings were made . He pinches bits of powdered pigments from the little clay bowls at his feet , stuffs them into his mouth , chews until a bloodred foam seeps from between his lips . He puts a hand up to the wall , leans in close , sprays the paint in bursts from his mouth . When he takes his hand away there 's a perfect stencil on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Phoebe chews , the two of them standing together in the chill cave . Yves leans in close , watching . You must chew until it 's a thin paste , he says . Phoebe smiles , shakes her head : it is n't ready yet . Yves looks sympathetic . The taste is not too terrible , no ? Phoebe shakes her head again . Actually she likes the metallic twang of the minerals , the sensory connection with them . She lays her hand on the cold cave wall , feels the warm spray of paint from her mouth . Her print , when she takes her hand away , looks small , the fingers curved outward . <p> Yves takes her into the main cavern , runs his flashlight across the ceiling until he finds a print directly overhead . Here , he whispers , you can see how badly mutilated this one is . His spotlight hovers over a twenty-thousand-year-old hand , the upper joints of all four fingers clearly missing . Jesus , says Phoebe . And this one , says Yves , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , says Phoebe . And here , says Yves , is one missing three fingers . <p> Is it just a few hands ? Phoebe wonders . You know , the same ones over and over again ? <p> No , says Yves , the prints are of hundreds of different hands . And they 're not just folding their fingers down . Here you can see where the amputation is made between the joints . And here , the scar is misshapen . <p> What 's that ? asks Phoebe , squinting up into the light . <p> Yves moves his flashlight backwards a few inches . These are the handprints of children , he says . And over here-he flips the light over to the opposite wall  --  are the hands of very small babies . Phoebe studies the prints , the tiny , perfectly intact fingers stenciled in black and red , foreshadowing their own long-extinct pain . <p> On her last evening in the Dordogne , Phoebe strolls along the banks of the Vezere . The river eddies around the submerged tips of willow branches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grace of the landscape , the small motions and unhurried pace . Vladimir would love it . Would lie back in the grass on the banks of the river as she played with his hair and told him her idea for the Harriet . How firelight would appear on the mottled brown and white limestone of a cave wall , the torch itself unseen , but red flashes from the flames washing through , highlighting the stumps of old stalactites , casting deep shadows into the hollows . Then a fine splatter-pattern of black would emerge , growing into a sinuous line around a natural bulge in the wall . A second line would appear , around a second , rounder bulge . A third line would connect the two . <p> Three lines  --  magic  --  two mammoths . Long trunks curled around each other , tusks intertwined , humped shoulders flowing into shaggy backs . <p> She meanders up the winding road to the row of ancient houses built into the base of the cliffs in Les Eyzies-de-Tayac . Honey-colored stones glow in the last sunshine . Lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the open windows . Watches young girls setting dinner tables . Smells the perfume of black truffles and onions . She envies the clan warmth , the affection . In her mind , she begins to plan a new phase to her cave-art animation on the Harriet . The black-and-red splatter pattern will emerge in the mottled firelight , but as quickly as it appears it will begin to disappear , to erode grain by grain until only a faint outline of the two mammoths remains , trunks entwined , a suggestion , then nothing . <p> She walks past the houses , up to the next terrace . She gazes down over the gauzy darkness sifting into the valley . In Cro-Magnon times the caves would have been lit with the small flickers of campfires . Threads of smoke would have spun up to the stars . Ice Age tigers would have roared . She 'd be eating reindeer meat , a Cro-Magnon baby curled into her hair . She felt the yearning for it , the neediness , but also the weight . Her breasts were big as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoebe is pounding marrow out of bison bones . Where is Vladimir ? Making cave paintings , she 's sure , while she stokes the fire , tossing stones at hungry bears , her own dreams deferred . <p> Nothing has changed . Nothing would change . She has always in a way lived without him , since the beginning . <p> <p> By Julia Whitty <p>
