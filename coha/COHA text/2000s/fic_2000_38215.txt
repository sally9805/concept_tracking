WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN my Uncle Henry said something I used to puzzle over : " Your mama thinks your daddy 's a man wrapped in gold . " <p> I was holding my sister 's hand when he said this . ' We stepped through the grass toward our house . Mother and Father were walking ahead of us . Father 's shirt and jeans were coated with rock dust . He and Uncle Henry had just gotten in from work . <p> " Wrapped in gold , " my baby sister Lexie said . " He is not . That 's awful . " <p> I thought of those words and how Lexie , then just four , might see them . I imagined my father shrouded in golden light . I tried to bring him alive in my imagination , have him-being in all that golden light as he was-smile or dance or perform some magical feat , but he sat and peered stonily at me . His gaze and stillness were eerie and lonely . In my mind 's eye , the gold itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father only stared . <p> I told her , " It 's just an expression . " <p> " Well , " she said , frowning . " I would n't have a man wrapped in gold . " <p> One winter evening that year , Father took us to visit his mother . The kitchen was lit with candles , and Grandmother sat at the table chewing snuff . Her lips disappeared in a circle of tobacco-stained wrinkles , and she worked the lump side to side in her mouth . Her eyes were a strange , glassy light-blue that you could see even in pitch dark , but the darkness then was not complete . The sun shone feebly through the cardboard-covered window above the sink . She was calling me to come nearer . <p> From the doorway I went into the room that , despite all the candles , smelled not of smoky wax but of whiskey and cigarettes . She held my hand for some time , running her callused fingers over the line in my palm , before she spat in a rusted can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she added , " But a very long life , " and let go . <p> Mother rose from the table and knelt in front of me . I had forgotten her presence , she was so quiet . I knew she did not want to be in that room , that she was not feeling well . She had recently miscarried what would have been her sixth baby . Day after day she had been bleeding , and she felt weak . My mother told me this . My mother told me almost everything . I was her oldest child . In strange towns she always had me to talk to . And there were things she did n't have to say . I knew my father had deceived her into coming to my grandmother 's . He had said he was coming to ask his brother about a job , but he came for the whiskey . He was at the table next to Uncle Henry , drinking again . I heard him say , " You do n't need to read me the damned cards . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know the up-and-down that 's in my future . You read them damned cards every time I come visit . If you 're going to see it , see it clear and get it over with . " <p> Mother whispered , " Take the children and wait in the truck . We 'll be along in a minute . " <p> The five of us walked out into the icy sunlight . The sun was just above the trees and would soon disappear . No light could filter through the thick surrounding woods , in whose recesses locusts , elms , maples , and water oaks crowded so closely that every sound seemed swallowed by the heavy air . <p> My brother , Sam , stepped up on the truck bumper , and I handed Lexie to him . Alley and Nancy remained on the porch , trying to listen in . They looked like oddly mixed versions of our parents , Alley with her pale hair and dark skin , sienna eyes , Nancy all opposites , black hair and light skin , though her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . They were a flattened green . The girls were bony and frail , always huddled or hiding somewhere together in their secret world . At four , Lexie , with her lanky legs , was almost as tall , though they were two and three years older . <p> " Come on , " I said to them . <p> " In a minute , " Nancy said . <p> " You 're asking for trouble , " I said , but I let it go and went to lie down in the truck bed with Lexie and Sam . The southern half of the sky was covered in clouds . I hoped my father hurried . If it rained , we would all have to cram inside the cab , and I loved riding in the back of the truck . From there I would listen to the tires crunch over gravel , I might catch the sounds of whippoorwills and panthers calling through the trees , and I would imagine the animals that lived deep in those woods and that no one had ever seen . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to go see Mister Hockaday . " She was speaking of our calf at home , the calf Father had purchased a month before , when we first returned to our farm in Mississippi . We had given up trying to convince her that Mister Hockaday should actually be Miss Hockaday . Father had said , " Do n't let her be naming and getting attached to no damned cow . " <p> " We all want to , " Sam said , and then to me , " What do you think Grandma 's telling him ? " <p> " Oh , I do n't know . He 'll be so drunk he wo n't even remember . " " Do you believe her ? Do you believe she knows ? " <p> " I do n't know what I believe , " I said . <p> I held Lexie 's hand , wanting that softness to replace the gritty touch of my grandmother . We fell asleep listening to the rustling in the woods . In summer , there would be so many frogs that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always reminds me of ancient life that has endured and will endure long past my own , of secrets in the dark woods . <p> I was dreaming of movement , an approach to the lights of some town , when I felt my mother 's kiss . I opened my eyes as she drew away . Nancy was asleep with her head on Sam 's thigh , Alley with her head on my stomach . Lexie was still between us . My father covered us with a quilt he must have taken from his mother 's house . I could smell the whiskey on his breath even from the side panel where he stood . <p> Mother drove , and we were heading toward no city lights . We crept over a gravel road , surrounded by the endless Mississippi trees and waters . My father had built roads like this one all over the country . He had cut through hills in Virginia , plains in Oklahoma , mountains in Colorado , the White Sands of New Mexico . In so many towns and states that I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to be paved . Now , after ten years , he had brought us back to our farm . Too many children to keep moving . <p> We were almost home when the truck started swerving . I heard my father 's shouts muffled and then lost in the wind of the truck 's movewent and knew he was grabbing the wheel . Mother had told me again and again not to be angry with him ; the rainy weather made his lungs hurt more , the lull in work scared him , so he numbed himself . <p> When we pulled to a stop in front of our house , I heard my mother say , " It 's nothing , no judgment . I just do n't believe anyone knows what 's going to happen tomorrow . " <p> My father got out , slammed the door , and went in before I had gotten everyone awake . Mother lifted Lexie from the truck , and we all went inside to bed . <p> Most of the next day Mother kept us outside while my father drank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to find in winter . Once I went in the house , unnoticed by my father though I stood right behind him . I watched the ashes glowing between his fingers and thought he might burn himself as he repeated a phone number , a name , an address . Before he hung up , I heard him say , " I sure do . I got it written right here , " though he 'd written nothing down . He lit another cigarette . Then he rested his head in his hands . He slumped over as if the air itself was a weight too heavy to bear . The distance between us was only a few feet , but I could not force myself through . He touched his neck as if he felt something and turned to me . " Caroline , " he said . He studied me a moment then said , " Get a pen and paper . " <p> I brought a pen and pad from a basket my mother kept on top of the refrigerator . I handed them to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " and he told me the name and number . When I went to give him the paper , he waved me back . " Read it to me , " he said . When I had , he said , " Right . Leave it on the table , and go out and help your mama . " <p> As I went out , I thought of a game we played often , tossing out numbers , watching Father add , subtract , divide , and multiply in his head . Any problem you could think of he could solve , but I never saw him read or write a word . <p> Late that afternoon Father ran out of whiskey . All of us children but Lexie were helping Mother in the garden when he stepped onto the porch . Lexie was swinging on a tire that hung from a tree near the barn . The calf was next to her , on the other side of the barbed-wire fence . <p> In the distance I saw flashes of lightning and heard thunder , but since yesterday the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the rocking chair on the porch . He hollered " Emaline , " but my mother pretended not to hear . She worked faster . We had three rows of peas , two each of turnips and collards , one of tomatoes . Mother had planted eyes of potatoes in another row . We were shaping the mounds of dirt so water would tunnel through . Mother said , " Caroline , get Lexie and take her in the house . " To my brother and sisters she said , <p> " You all go around back one at a time and get inside . " <p> Father yelled again , " Goddamn , Emaline , the power 's out . Goddamned storm 's knocked the power out somewhere . Why the hell did you want to come back to this hellhole ? " <p> When I got to Lexie her body was an upside-down V over the tire . She kicked off in the swing , saying , " Do n't listen , do n't listen , Mister Hockaday . " <p> " Time to go in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swing and lifting her . <p> She kept her body loose and floppy in my arms and giggled . The calf began tearing into a bale of hay . <p> " Ah , " Lexie said . " Already ? " <p> " What do you mean , already ? You been outside all day long . " I shook her . " Straighten out your legs before I drop you . " <p> She straightened her legs but kept them loose when I tried to stand her on the ground . " Carry me , Caroline , " she said . <p> " Oh , all right . " <p> Our father was shouting , " Goddamn listen to me . " The chair clapped against the side of the house when he stood . He came off the porch and started walking toward the garden . <p> " Daddy 's mad , " Lexie said . " Why ? " <p> " Daddy 's silly , " I said , and she arched in my arms , staring upside down at the calf . " Good-bye , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I did not bother going around back , since my father had left the porch . Sam was sitting on the porch swing . Alley and Nancy were inside . I could hear them whispering on the couch by the living-room window behind us . <p> " He touches her , " Sam said , " I 'll take a two-by-four and " - he demonstrated through the air- " I 'll knock some sense into him . " <p> " You wo n't do anything , " I told him . " You do anything , you 'll make it worse . Just be quiet . Mother would hate to hear you talk like that . " <p> " Emaline ! " Father yelled . " I need you to drive to town . This is it . " He held up the near-empty whiskey bottle and shook it . " Emalinel You think I do n't know you can hear me ? " <p> " I hear you , " said Mother . " I 'm not going to town . When I finish up here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants a drink , he wants a drink . " <p> " A drink ? " she asked . " Carson , you have a drink . " <p> " Do n't mother me , Emaline , " he said . " Get in that goddamned truck and drive . " <p> " I 'm not , " Mother said . " I 'm going to finish here and get dinner . Are n't you hungry ? " <p> He downed the contents of the bottle and flung it through the air . " You want me to drive , " he threatened , " I 'll drive . " He walked to the truck and opened the passenger door , then changed his mind . <p> He fumbled in his pockets . " Where 's my goddamned keys ? " he asked , jerking to get his hands free because they had gotten stuck in his jean pockets . He jerked again and almost fell over before he steadied himself . His hands free , he went to slam the door and hit it against his leg . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll see . You want me to drive ? " He started across the yard , kicked at rosebushes as he went and instead hit the metal bucket we used to feed the calf . He passed Mother in the garden and walked through the field . <p> " Where are you going , Carson ? " she asked . " Let 's go inside . Let 's have dinner . " <p> " Talk now , " he said . " I 'm going to drive . That 's what you want . " lie kept walking until he got to the tractor . <p> Though the sun was not bright , my mother shaded her eyes and watched as Father got on the tractor and cranked the engine . She continued to stand there as the huge tires came toward her , and she ran away only as the machine entered the opposite end of the garden . In seconds the center was leveled , most of the plants uprooted . She stared with her mouth open , dumbly , as my father circled and headed toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she finally started backing away from us , toward the woods . <p> " Hurry ! Hurry ! " Lexie screamed , grabbing my dress and pinching my leg . When Mother made it to the woods , she hesitated , then began running back toward the house . I called , " Nol Run between the trees , " but she could not hear . The clearing around the garden , the yard we played in , seemed too vast for her to beat the tractor . <p> Lexie kept screaming , " Hurry ! Hurry ! " <p> From inside the house I heard Nancy say , " He 's going to kill her . " The tractor splintered wooden fences , mangled the wheelbarrow , grazed the shed , and smashed rosebushes . Father collided with anything Mother used to protect herself in her curving , stumbling run away from him . <p> As my mother and the pursuing tractor drew near us , she gathered the hem of her dress , bunching it high above her knees . A few feet before us she threw herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath the porch . <p> No one screamed or called out as the tractor headed toward us . None of us ran . At the last moment , Father veered left . Pieces of dirt and grass filled the air , our eyes , and our lungs as Father jumped down and came to the porch steps . The engine sputtered , and as it died off , I could hear Mother breathing beneath us . <p> Father pounded on the floorboards . He hollered , " Want me to drive some more ? " He knelt and groped for Mother . " Get out from there ! " <p> Lexie let go of my dress . " No , " she yelled . " No , silly ! " Father looked up and she laughed , stuck her elbow in the air as she grabbed a handful of hair at the nape of her neck , fisting and releasing . <p> " What ? " he asked , squinting as if to peer through distant haze . <p> " That 's enough , " she said , shaking her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dizzied at Lexie 's breach of the unspoken rules-be quiet , do n't let him see you look at him , do n't move too much , keep your face blank , be quiet , do n't look . Maybe this time wo n't be so bad . I knew that the anger my father directed at Mother could easily shift to us-that doing anything only made the hurts he could inflict worse . It gave him something tangible to fight against . <p> Father rose and stood in front of Lexie . The wrinkles around his eyes relaxed , and he seemed to see her , really see her . He said , " Damn right . Daddy 's silly . " <p> In a rush she said , " That 's right and so is Lexie . " <p> He knocked on the porch once more . " Think I could n't have run you over if I 'd wanted ? " To Sam and me he asked , " What the hell are you looking at ? " He fumbled in his pockets . " Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slammed again . Sam jangled the keys . " Daddy ! " he called , tossing the ring to our father . <p> When Father drove away , Mother crawled from beneath the porch . She sat with her back against the boards , not looking at us ; instead she stared toward the woods . Leaves rustled . A breeze came and receded , sucked into the dark spaces between trees . I smelled rain , felt mist on my face . <p> " Well , " Mother said finally . <p> Sam held his hand out for her . He was crying . I became aware that water was flooding the leveled garden . I went around to shut off the faucet . Scraggly tops of turnips floated in pools . When I came back , Mother was standing and Sam was helping her brush dirt off her clothes . <p> " We better get lamps , " I said to Sam . " The power 's out . " <p> When we got to the now-crooked shed , Sam punched it . " Look how he tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got any sense . " <p> " A lot of sense you have , " I said , " trying to bust your hand . " <p> Inside the shed we filled four lamps with kerosene and lit them . Sam said , " I hate him , Caroline . " <p> " Quit it , " I said . " Mother would n't want you to talk like that . Stop this . Do n't let Mother see you cry . " <p> On the way back we went to look at the garden . I picked up a muddy , smashed turnip . Sam kicked a clump of dirt , and mud splashed on my legs . <p> " You 're getting mud on me I do n't want , " I said . <p> He kicked another clump , so I threw the muddy turnip in his face . " You , " he said , throwing a clod at me . " All you care about is not getting dirty . " <p> " That 's not true , " I said , raking my fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of stem and root , and I threw my handful at him , splattering the side of his head . <p> He pointed angrily at me . Then he clenched his fist and bent to pick up the hose . I followed as he dragged it back to the spigot and we washed off . <p> The living room opened up into the kitchen . Once the lamps gave the rooms enough light , Sam sat on the couch and read to Lexie , Nancy , and Alley . I went with Mother into the bathroom , which smelled of moss and flowers . My mother had plants hanging from every corner , vines growing all around the window . I turned the faucet on . In the lamplight our shadows stretched from floor to ceiling , darkening then fading . <p> My mother waited until I looked away before she undressed . The tub filled , and she stepped in . " It stings , " she said , and drew her bloody knees up . When she covered her breasts , I saw that her arms were scraped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud into the trash , draped the dress over the hamper . <p> From the cabinet , I took a washcloth . I knelt beside the tub . " 1 want to , " I said , drawing the cloth away as she reached for it . She crossed her arm back over the other to hold and cover her breasts . " I wo n't look , " I said . " Here , let me . " I reached , and she gave me her hand . I sponged away dirt and blood from one arm , then took the other . <p> " We wo n't use soap , " I said . " It would sting more . " <p> It was difficult to tell what was dried blood and what was dirt on her knees , but I dabbed until I found the pink undersurface of skin . My mother was dark like her father , and I thought of him then , how he could supposedly heal , how he could say the words and place them in your mind so you would heal yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stop the bleeding . We never asked him for healing . He never gave us any . <p> " Caroline , " my mother said , squeezing my hand so that water rushed from the cloth inside it . " I do n't want you taking care of me . " " I 'm not . " I said . " Let me do something . We just stand there and watch . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said , grimacing as she stretched her legs into the water . " I should have just gone . It 's already started . He would n't have stopped drinking . I hope he comes back . " <p> " Mother , he always comes back . " I stood with the soap and washcloth and scrubbed her bony shoulders . As I rinsed her , she reached behind her head and took the cloth from me . " Feel better ? " I asked . <p> " Yes , " she said , and again , " I 'm sorry . " <p> " It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a towel . " Dry off . I 'll get a clean dress . " <p> Beside their bed was a full ashtray and an empty bottle of Three Roses . <p> I brought Mother her clothes and looked out the open window at the moon just beginning to wane and reflecting in the dark pond at the edge of our land , where the woods met the field . A light fog rose from the water . <p> I asked , " Why do you always want him to come back ? " <p> " It 's not always like this , Caroline . " <p> " No , " I said . " Usually it 's worse . " <p> She said , " He 'll feel bad when the whiskey wears off . " <p> The flame flickered , almost went out . I turned up the wick and looked outside again at the misty , dark pond . " I ca n't wait for the frogs , " I said . " There must be a million of them in summer . They 'll sing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help but care for someone you 've had five children with . " <p> I carried the lamp to light our way through the house . <p> The next day we reworked the garden , and then we waited , rain drumming on the roof , thunder and lightning sounding and flashing nearby . It was night when the rain lulled and Father came home . Lexie was at the front window . " It is , " she said . " It 's him . " <p> Outside the water-speckled glass , I saw what she saw , the glow of my father 's eyes in the dark-that same blue as his mother 's . He was looking toward us . My father was a huge man . He had to slump some to sit behind the wheel . <p> The inside cab light came on when he opened the door , but he remained sitting for a few moments before he stood . He stumbled toward us , fingers brushing his golden hair into more of a mess . <p> " Unlock the door , " Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tan out . He missed when he tried to pat her on the head and kept staggering forward with her trailing after , skipping . He was talking to himself . He waved us away and stumbled into the bedroom . We could hear the clunk , clunk as he lined up bottles at the side of the bed . <p> The next few days we played outside when it was not raining . When it was , we listened to him call for cigarettes and whiskey . My mother would say , " Right there beside you , Carson . " At night sometimes he would cry out , and his nightmares would press into our dreams . We knew that the clouds and the rain made his lungs hurt . We knew that only whiskey or the movement of work could ease his pain . We waited for the call , the moment he would get up and go to some construction site or gravel pit where more rock dust would coat his lungs . The call would surely come . It was said that no one anywhere could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best at what he did . <p> It must have been a week later when Uncle Henry drove up to the house . He and Mother kept repeating to my father that a company wanted him to go to New Orleans to work . Finally he understood , and Uncle Henry left , saying he needed our father to pick him up in two days . Once he understood there was a job , my mother knew she could take away the whiskey , give him only a little in his first cups of coffee as he weaned himself and the trembling stopped . One day of coffee and eating while he spent hours hammering and reboarding the shed , anything reparable that he had broken . He hugged us all and drove away . <p> The electricity was on but the phone line dead . Each day the postman came at noon . Each day we looked for the letter or check that was not there . <p> Winter break was over , but Mother had not sent us to school . She kept saying we would wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could send us off with full stomachs . We would wait until we heard from Father . All we had left in the house was beans and flour . A little of the same thing every day , but never enough or what we needed , only made our hunger sharper . <p> It had been raining almost every day since Father left . One morning my mother got up and said , " Another dreary day , " and shut the curtains . Lexie was sitting on the rug in the living room , singing , and Mother did not sing with her . She did not try to cheer us . She had gone to boil water for coffee , and stood at the stove staring into the saucepan , her hands moving heavily from her hair to her stomach . <p> I was wishing Mother had not shut the curtains . It only made the house darker . She opened the door , and dark blue-gray light seeped through the clouds . From the laundry shed she took buckets , ammonia , a mop and broom . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was then that she lost herself in dreaming . I knelt next to her . Her hands were no longer moving . <p> " Mother , do you feel all right ? " <p> " Nothing is going to grow in this weather , " she said . " There 's no sun . " <p> I poured some ammonia in the bucket . She had us cleaning the house so much our hands were chapped . <p> " Your daddy could show up tomorrow , " she said . " Or it could be weeks . Maybe never . " <p> " Not never . You know he always comes back . " <p> " But who knows when ? " <p> " We could go to the neighbors , " I said . <p> " Asking , " Mother said . " Always asking . I ca n't . I wo n't . " <p> I took the bucket to the sink to fill it with water . Mother remained on the floor . " I know you 're tired , " I said . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caroline , get Sam . There 's something I want you two to help me with . " <p> Mother held the butcher knife in her hand . Sam pulled the barbed wire apart wide enough we could slip through easily . The calf brushed against the three of us , nudging her nose at our hands for us to feed or pet her . <p> " Sam , " Mother said . " You saw your daddy kill that hog . You remember how he did it ? " <p> " No , Mama . I did n't look . " <p> " Maybe we should walk to the neighbors ' . Get someone that knows how , " I said , but imagined myself walking miles down the road to some neighbor , some stranger , and saying , " Hi , I 'm Caroline from down the way . Can you come help us kill our calf ? " <p> Sam said , " Should we shoot her first ? " <p> Mother 's hands were trembling . " Do you know where a gun is ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I guess not , " Sam said . " We 're going to break Lexie 's heart . " <p> She said , " This is what your daddy bought the calf for . We 'll think of something to tell her so she do n't have to know . Your daddy told us not to let Lexie get attached . " <p> " Slit her throat , " Sam said . " I think that 's how . Slit it quick . " <p> She lifted the knife and froze . <p> Sam said , " Just so you know , that hog screamed . I do n't know if the calf will , but that hog screamed like crazy . " <p> " You all hold her , " Mother said , and Sam and I put our arms around Hockaday 's body . With my cheek against the barrel of the calf , I watched Mother . To aim she pressed the blade against the calf 's throat twice . Then she lifted her hand high in the air . As she slashed downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enough to trip Sam and me , but not enough to shake us loose . " Oh , God , " Mother said , holding the fingertips of her empty hand above Hockaday 's neck . " I missed . " The cut she had made was about two inches long and not deep . <p> The screen door slammed , and Lexie came running out . " Get away ! " she screamed . She wriggled quickly through the fence , then pinched and clawed at our arms and pushed us . We both moved back from Hockaday . Lexie threw herself against Mother 's legs and began punching her . She did not make a sound ; she just kept punching . <p> Mother held the knife above her head to keep it from harming Lexie . She spoke as if entranced : " I do n't even know what I 'm doing . It 's not worth it . How many days anyway would it last ? " <p> We were all staring at Lexie as though she were only a dream . Finally Sam pulled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See Hockaday ? She 's OK . " <p> I took the knife from Mother , and I wanted to shake her . I wanted to shake her until she cried . <p> We went back to the house . Mother told us all to get pillows and pile them on the living-room floor so we could cuddle . We pushed the pillows against the wall . Mother was at the stove fidgeting with knobs , putting pans in the sink . She checked all the windows and came to join us . <p> We snuggled against each other , found feet , hands , faces , hair , any piece of each other we could touch so we were all touching each other at once . All the children kept giggling and fidgeting and pinching one another . Alley pretended she was snoring . <p> " What are we doing ? " Nancy asked . <p> " We 're all going to sleep for a while , " Mother said . " Say prayers . " No one waited for a turn . Lexie said , " Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " Make Daddy hurry home , " Sam said . <p> " And , " Nancy said , " make him be in a good mood . " At this , we were laughing again . <p> " Our Father , which art in heaven , hallowed be , " Alley began . " Hallowed ween , " said Lexie . <p> " Thy will ... " But it was no use . We could not stop laughing . Finally everyone grew quiet . My head felt as if it was filled with loud static . I was seeing through webby , dull light , strands of which I felt on my face . <p> " Does God have a will ? " Sam asked . " What does that mean ? " " Well , of course , " Mother said . " He has a plan for everything . " <p> It was difficult to hear them through the noise . I said , " He probably gives the will to us , " and had trouble speaking loudly enough . My words were icy shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was floating . I did not want to think . I needed to hurry and think . <p> " He gives the will to us , " I repeated . " Mother , are you listening ? " " I 'm listening . Caroline . Come closer . " <p> " I ca n't get any closer , " I said , and laughed . The ice had run into my veins , and I kept realizing I was not falling . " I want to leave here someday . " <p> " Oh , Caroline , sleep , " she said . " What does someday matter ? " " I 'll leave and send for everyone when I can . " <p> " I can never go . Where will you go ? Nowhere . Please let 's sleep . " All I wanted to do was sleep , but Lexie and Nancy were sleeping and I was afraid of their sleep . I lifted Lexie 's hand , and it fell like a rock . <p> " This is not a good sleep , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " For what ? " <p> " All of us have to have our own chance , " I said as the light fell over me , sticking to my arms and face . I moved to stand , saying , " I smell gas . I 'm going to check the stove . " <p> " No . " Mother said , touching my arm , removing webby strands of light and finally crying . " I 'll check . " <p> I do not remember any other days before my father returned . He was inside the house before we heard a sound . In his arms he held packages and a box of dry ice and frozen seafood-oysters , shrimp , and soft-shell crab . My brother and sisters ran to him , jumping up and down at his side . <p> " Emaline ? " he called . " Where 's my Emaline ? " <p> I watched Mother come into the room . Whatever she saw when she saw my father erased everything else . The circles beneath her eyes faded . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Father spread one arm out , the presents still cradled in the other . Mother went to him , touched his cheek , then wrapped her arms around his neck . The packages spilled at their feet . Out came strings of Mardi Gras beads , tiny voodoo dolls , and toy instruments-saxophones , trumpets , and clarinets for us children . There was satin lingerie for Mother . Father lifted and twirled her , saying , " Ah , there 's my Emaline . " <p> It 's true that they glowed . He squeezed her like that for some time , hanging on as if both their lives depended on it . Then Father called us to come hear about what he brought . There was something he had seen that he had saved up to tell each of us , a different story for each child . We remained very near , waiting our turns . I snatched my time with the outward calm of an expert thief . <p> In my mother 's eyes I searched for a trace of that same stealth . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though nothing in my life had been so difficult to accept , it 's true : To her he was indeed a man wrapped in gold . <p> As my grandmother predicted , I have had a long life and have no children . Through the years I have searched , and I have never found a moment in anyone 's arms that could erase everything . What endless wishes our parents created for us in that embrace . <p>
