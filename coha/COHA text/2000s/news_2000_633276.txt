<p> I have been working on the issue of e-commerce and taxation for more than a year while serving as co-chairman of an e-commerce task force for the National Conference of State Legislators . Since there appears to be some confusion about this issue , let me tell you first what it 's not about . This issue is not about applying a new tax to the Internet , and it is not about government looking for a new source of revenue . <p> As a society , we have historically paid for government through three primary sources of revenue : the income tax , the property tax and the sales tax . The discussion of taxing e-commerce is simply a matter of tax fairness  --  applying the existing sales tax to all transactions . To not do so is to risk destabilizing how we fund things like law enforcement and schools . <p> The issue of taxation and e-commerce is a matter of leveling the playing field between brick and mortar businesses and those that only exist to fill orders placed through the Internet . The brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide jobs for our neighbors . It is unfair to add the burden of collecting sales taxes on their sales when multibillion-dollar Internet companies get a free pass . <p> We need to reform and simplify our tax system , and our goal must be to lower the overall tax burden . The system we develop must be fair . One of the reasons the current federal income tax should be overhauled is because within its thousands of pages are thousands of special-interest deductions . Similarly , the current unfair application of taxes to transactions should also be reformed . <p> I am willing and happy to debate solutions to the problem of excessive taxation . In fact , I have some ideas of my own that would simplify and lower taxes . But until serious tax reform is under way , it is wrong to jeopardize one of the primary ways we fund state and local governmental services . <p> Sen. Steven J. Rauschenberger <p> ( R-Elgin ) <p> Suspect motives <p> The Sun-Times ran a news story ( March 7 ) about " big signs " placed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's Shawn Margaret Donnelley ; she 's a woman , she wants you to know ! ) . Buried in the story is a note mentioning that six of the 11 GOP candidates are millionaires , including Donnelley ( who 's an executive with R.R. Donnelley &; Sons Co. , how odd ) . <p> I think we need to question these millionaire candidates about why they want to become congressmen . What is the allure ? Certainly , the campaign and the job are downsizing of sorts from the work these millionaires must do ! I suspect it 's the power ( real or imagined ) that comes with the job . <p> I live in the 10th District , and I 'll be voting for the poorest candidate ( if I declare as a Republican ) . I suggest the Sun-Times find out who are the least-wealthy candidates in this district and report on that . <p> Mike Carniello , <p> Mount Prospect <p> Blame big oil <p> Michelle Stevens brings out some good points about the gas guzzlers ( column , March 5 ) . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the article does not mention the oil cartel , which is really rigging the price of oil to an artificially high price by reducing the supply . There is no oil shortage . <p> The oil embargoes of the ' 70s were a cutoff of oil supplies , which drove up the price of petroleum products . The big factor in today 's high gasoline price is that the oil companies are keeping an artificially low inventory of petroleum products . <p> Inventories of petroleum products rose 0.1 percent in January , while supply fell 13 percent from a year ago . In the latest period , crude inventories declined 2.6 million barrels to 282.8 million barrels and gasoline stockpiles fell a sharp 3.8 million barrels to 196.7 million barrels . These statistics come from the Investors Business Daily of Feb. 17 . And you wonder why gasoline prices are high ! <p> It does n't take a genius to see what big oil is doing . I would be willing to bet that big oil is still refining oil that was purchased last year at $ 10 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express my opinion of the free marketplace . <p> Leonard Zablocki , <p> Arlington Heights <p> Tobacco 's extortion <p> The mind-set of many politicians , in particular the Clinton administration , is that the manufacturers of legal adult products  --  alcohol , tobacco and guns  --  are liable for those products getting into the wrong hands . <p> Those politicians must think people are idiots to believe it 's the responsibility of manufacturers to uphold the laws of their products . <p> The tobacco industry , at the expense of smokers , allowed itself to be raped by the states for $ 206 billion . <p> Here is one example of what is happening to extorted money from the tobacco settlement . Rather than the ill-gotten dollars going to teach minors about smoking and for the health care of smokers , Los Angeles wants $ 100 million of the settlement money to fund lawsuits stemming from police corruption . <p> Florian Kochanny , <p> Evergreen Park <p> Let the people pay <p> When Attorney General Janet Reno filed a lawsuit using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged Medicare costs , she did so on the same day that a grand jury , concluding a five-year investigation of the matter , found the government has no case . In April 1997 , Reno and her aide Joe Krovisky acknowledged that the government has no legal authority to maintain this lawsuit . A federal jury in Ohio agreed , dismissing a case brought there on similar grounds . The jury found for the tobacco companies in a unanimous verdict . But when President Clinton ordered the lawsuit in January 1999 , the attorney general meekly agreed . <p> People have lost sight of the fact that working people who smoke are really paying all of the $ 206 billion of the settlement , not the tobacco companies . It 's just another onerous tax disguised as a " win " by the attorneys general . The winners are the government and lawyers , not the people . What suckers we all are , to be misled by our political leaders . <p> By the way , whatever did happen to that multibillion-dollar surplus anyway ? Has n't it been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thaddeus J. Kochanny , <p> Ingleside <p> A different view <p> In regard to the letter ( Feb. 28 ) by Victor H. Perez criticizing prosecutors seeking the death penalty , my family along with two other families lost three loved ones to violent crime . My son , along with two co-workers , was viciously murdered by three brutal savages . <p> First of all , prosecutors worked day and night . People who think they have an eight-hour job , five days a week , are wrong . <p> Perez speaks of taking a human life . What about the human life these three murdering savages took ? Who gave them the right to take the lives of three loving productive citizens who left 10 children ? <p> The three offenders should have lost their rights when they decided to take life into their own hands and murdered someone . What about the victims ' rights ? Perez and people who think like him should visit the Victims Memorial Program in October and see the family members grieving over the loss of loved ones . I pray that Perez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to thank the prosecutors ' office , Cook County State 's Attorney Richard Devine and the Victims Witness Program for getting us through these hard trials , and working night and day and weekends . <p> Donald E. Mikesh Sr. , <p> Garfield Ridge <p> Shut up and enjoy <p> Many Chicago White Sox fans are always complaining . A Morningline question was " Should the White Sox trade Frank Thomas ? " And 76.5 percent responded " yes " ( column , March 2 ) . <p> If Ron Schueler trades Thomas , then watch these same ( loyal ? ) fans holler , " How could Schueler trade a future Hall of Fame player ? " <p> They screamed  --  get rid of Albert Belle . Get rid of Jamie Navarro . They 're gone . <p> So quit complaining . Buy some tickets and enjoy this young , promising team . <p> Sam J. Schneider , Dunning <p> Proud Latina <p> I can not say enough about Miriam Santos , former city treasurer of Chicago . She was wrongfully sentenced and deserves her job back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup and is seen as a threat to the Chicago political machine . <p> Santos is a fighter and has always been a positive role model for our community . It is not easy for Hispanic women to excel in this country , but she has fought back like a true Latina . Santos , you have made us proud ! <p> Zoraida Rios-Andino , <p> East Chicago , Ind .
