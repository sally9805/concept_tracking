Enter , staggering across the tundra , a half-starved revolutionary escaped from a Russian prison camp .

With these chess pieces Meek stages a stunningly bleak Dostoyevskian drama , exploring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human body-the book 's title refers not to sex but to cannibalism . <P> THE WORLD TO COME DARA HORN <P> A Nerdy quiz-show writer impulsively swipes a Chagall during a party at a museum .

It 's a poor but proud city where tempers run high and everybody is ready to stab and/or shoot one another at the drop of a plumed , foppish hat and where a woman has just been found strangled in her sedan chair , along with a pouch of coins and a note that reads , " For Masses for your soul .
