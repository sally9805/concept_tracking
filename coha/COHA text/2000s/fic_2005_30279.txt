In the past ten years he 'd become a fat little sixty-year old guy with frizzy hair . The same guy she once thought was a genius because he could shoot a ninety-minute feature in ten days and be looking at a workprint two weeks later . . . Harry doing the first of the Slime Creatures in Griffith Park when she read for him in bra and panties , he said to give him an idea of her figure , and she got the part . Karen asked him if he did horror or T and A and Harry explained to her the philosophy of ZigZag Productions . " Zig for the maniac , escaped lunatic and dope-crazed biker pictures . " No vampires or werewolves ; she would never get bitten or eaten . " Zag for the ones featuring mutations fed on nuclear waste , your slime people , your seven-foot rats , your maggots the size of submarines . But there 's nothing wrong with showing a little skin in either type picture . " She told him if he was talking about full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porn , hard or soft . If she had to go to bed with him , okay , one time only , but it would have to be an awfully good part . Harry acted insulted . He said , " You ought to be ashamed of yourself , I 'm old enough to be your uncle . But I like your spunk and the way you talk . Where you from , somewhere in Texas ? " She told him he was close , Alamogordo , where her dad was a rocket man and her mom was in real estate . Karen told him she left to study drama at New Mexico State , but since coming here had done nothing but wait on tables . Harry said , " Let 's hear you scream . " She gave him a good one and he gave her a big smile saying , " Get ready to be a star . " Karen was slimed to death within twenty minutes of her first appearance on thescreen . Michael , who had also read for a part and was turned down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the set . It was where she first met Michael , when they were casting Slime Creatures fifteen years ago , saw him a few other times after , but they did n't seriously get it on until Michael was a star and she was living with Harry . . . tired of it , saying mean things and arguing by that time , picking at dumb lines that had never bothered her before . Like the one Harry threw at her in bed , out of nowhere . . . " Maybe it 's only the wind . " Knowing she 'd remember it . Instead of giving him a look , she should have said , " What 're you up to , Harry ? What can I do for you ? " Make him come out and say it instead of trying to take her down memory lane . It was so obvious . Harry wanted her to use her influence with Michael to set up a meeting . But wanted it to be her idea , happy to do him this favor because she owed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a ZigZag Productions star . But it was weird -- hearing that line again . When she first read it she said to Harry , " You 've got to be kidding . " It was his line , he was always rewriting , sticking in additional dialogue . Harry said , " Yeah , but it works . You hear the roof being torn off , you look up and say to the guy , ' Maybe it 's only the wind . ' You know why ? " " Because I 'm stupid ? " " Because you want it to be the wind and not that fucking maniac up there . It may sound stupid , but what it does , it gives the audience a chance to release nervous laughter . " " At my expense , " Karen said . And Harry said , " You going to sulk ? It 's entertainment , babe . It 's a put-on , the whole business of making pictures . You ever catch yourself taking it seriously you 're in trouble . " Karen recited the line . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand to make grossed over twenty million worldwide . She told Harry it was still schlock . He said , " Yeah , but it 's my schlock . If it does n't make me famous , at least it can make me rich . " She might ask Harry in the morning , " Who 's taking it seriously now ? " Harry dreaming of a twenty-million-plus production he 'd never get off the ground . And a star he 'd never sign . With or without her help . She might ask him , " Remember I told you last night about a picture I 've been offered ? " After a seven-year layoff . She had expected Harry to at least be curious , show some interest . " You remember I wanted to talk about it and all you said was ' Yeah ? Great ' ? " Now she was the one taking it seriously , standing on the upstairs landing in her T-shirt . . . listening , beginning to see the stairway and the foyer below as a set . It would be lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see-through nightie rather than a T-shirt . She hears a sound and calls out softly , " Harry ? Is that you ? " She starts down the stairs and stops as a shadow appears in the foyer , a moving shadow coming out of the study . She calls again , " Harry ? " in a stupid , tentative voice knowing goddamn well it is n't Harry . If it 's a Zig shadow , now the maniac appears , looks up , sees her . A Zag shadow is followed by a gross , oversized mutation . Either one , she stands there long enough to belt out a scream that will fill movie theaters , raise millions of goose bumps and make Harry a lot of money . Karen cleared her throat . It was something she always did before the camera rolled . Cleared her throat and took a deep breath . She had never screamed for the fun of it because it was n't fun . After only three takes -- Harry 's limit -- her throat would be raw . The house was so quiet . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about five beats . See what happens . And in almost the same moment heard Harry 's voice coming from the study . " We gon na sit here all night ? " Now she heard a faint murmur of voices , Harry 's and another voice , but not the words , Harry carrying on a conversation with someone who had walked in her house , or broken in . You could take that seriously . Now she heard Harry 's voice again , unmistakably Harry . " Yeah ? What 's it about ? " Those familiar words . A question she heard every day when they were living together and Harry got her involved in story development because he hated to read . What 's it about ? Never mind a script synopsis , coverage to Harry meant giving him the plot in three sentences , fifty words or less . Karen went back through the bedroom to the bathroom and turned the light on . She stared at herself in the mirror as she took a minute to run a comb through her hair . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood was about . Somebody making a pitch .
