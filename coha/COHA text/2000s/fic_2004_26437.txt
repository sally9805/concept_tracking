Perfect Princess : A Princess Diaries Book A Note from Her Royal Highness Princess Mia Grandmre says the only way we as a society can learn from our mistakes is carefully to scrutinize them , and vow never to repeat them . I guess this would explain why I 'm stuck in princess lessons with her every single weekday from four to six . Not surprisingly , Grandmre thinks SHE 's the most suitable person to consult about royal role models . She says in her day , young women did not look up to scantily clad , weapon-wielding princesses such as Xena and " that other one , the one with the robots and the buns on the sides of her head " ( ! ! ! ! ! ! ) but to royals such as Princess Margaret and Isabel of Spain . And though Grandmre says that there are any number of highly memorable princesses she would recommend that I emulate , she always adds , " Though I feel I can say  --  without flattering myself , which would be highly unprincesslike  --  that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I suppose it is setting a good example to smoke a pack a day and swill down about a zillion Sidecars before breakfast . On the other hand , it 's true you hardly ever read about Grandmre in the National Enquirer . She is the epitome of discretion . At least , outside the confines of the palace . Inside , all bets are off . Elizabeth , the Late Queen Mother by Grandmre , Dowager Princess of Genovia , grandmother to Mia Thermopolis with commentary by Princess Mia The late queen mother of Great Britain  --  often vulgarly referred to as the " Queen Mum "  --  is a perfect example of a princess who comported herself with grace and dignity throughout her long life . The mother of the longest-ruling sovereign in British history , one of Queen " Bess 's " most notable contributions to the throne was her insistence that her family stay together during World War II . Rather than shipping her two young daughters , the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret , to safety in the countryside , as many London parents were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palace . . . a palace that was frequently strafed by Luftwaffe gunfire and even , on several occasions , bombed by the Nazi horde . Her Majesty refused to be daunted by this senseless onslaught , and bravely visited her less fortunate subjects , commoners whose own homes had been blown to smithereens , in the very craters in which their beds once stood , offering tips as to how the damage might be repaired while never getting so much as a smudge on her crisp cotton gloves . Indomitable and cheerful throughout her husband 's reign , the queen mother is a perfect example of a regent who showed grace under pressure . . . and always while wearing a delightful confection of a chapeau . Um . Okay . The part about not fearing the Nazis is cool .

England 's Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Like their mother , the young Windsor princesses showed remarkable character during their teen years , despite living under constant threat of being murdered in their beds by an invading Nazi scourge . The brave princesses cheerfully assisted their mother in rolling bandages for the Royal Air Force , and wore cunning little khaki Wren uniforms , just like all the other British girls who chose to volunteer to stop the tyrannical oppression of the Axis powers by running canteens and casino nights for war-weary British soldiers . Through it all they had to endure not only the knowledge that they might at any moment be blown to kingdom come , but also rationing , as things like sugar and  --  perish the thought !  --  silk stockings were scarce and had to be saved for the war effort . Perhaps most horrifying of all , during the height of the war , the princesses were forced to bathe in a maximum of only four inches of tepid water , and only once daily . I have it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate the level the water was not to exceed . Such privations are doubtless why the two princesses grew into such responsible and respectable women , well capable of bearing the aristocratic mantle thrust upon them so early in life . That 's nothing . During water shortages in the summer time here in NYC , the mayor 's office issues directives about how often you are supposed to flush the toilet . Having to endure something like that is what I call character building . In fact , I might even be scarred for life . Mia 's Random Act of Princess : Be like Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret : Grow a Victory garden ! You do n't need a yard to do it , either . Plant basil and parsley seeds in cups of soil and place them on your windowsill . Snip off leaves when they are grown to add to salads , pasta dishes , even pizzas !
