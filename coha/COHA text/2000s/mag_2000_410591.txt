// YOU CAN STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME you hit a metal wood . It was a Taylor Made . It was 1988 , on a course Jack Nicklaus had just built in Orlando . The ball kept finding the fairway , and it went as far as you 'd ever hit it , and you shot 78 and won all the money . You still have the club somewhere . You remember the first time you hit the Killer Whale , too , that Wilson driver John Daly used to win the PGA Championship back in ' ' 91 . It had the biggest damn head you 'd ever seen , and it was white . You were taking range balls 260 out and over the fence at your little practice range . Now there 's an Orlimar driver in your bag . When you hit it right , you get 270 yards out of it-270 yards is enough for anyone . // Clockwise from bottom left : By placing the apex of the club face closer to the toe , Adams 's Tight Lies ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cobra Gravity Back driver ( $375 ) puts the club 's center of gravity not only at the bottom of the head but at the rear , which helps you hit the ball farther and straighter . The Tour Edge Bazooka Tungsten Beta Ti metal wood ( $250 ) uses beta titanium , resulting in a thinner , lighter club face . Callaway 's Big Bertha Steelhead Plus has a lot to boast about , but what 's really noticeable is that it 's a more affordable club ( $295 , as opposed to Callaway 's usual half a thou ) . Orlimar 's TriMetal Plus metal wood ( $400 ) uses a unique blend of steel , nickel , and chromium in the insert . Taylor Made 's SuperSteel driver ( $295 ) has a new steel composition that is 20 percent stronger than traditional 17-4 steel . // This is the promise of technology . It 's the promise that sold more than a hundred thousand of the putters Jack Nicklaus used when he won the 1986 Masters . It 's the promise that made Barney Adams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very same way you lost faith in your persimmon , the Taylor Made inevitably gave way to the Whale , which you sold in order to buy a Bertha , which you gave to a caddie when you bought the Orlimar . It 's the promise that keeps you playing this game : that we 're all just one club , one swing thought , one tweak away from hitting the ball farther , hitting the green more often , and making those four-footers every time . And yet , the reality is that , according to the USGA ( and they would know ) , the average handicap of American golfers is no lower today than it was forty years ago . Most golfers still ca n't break 100 . Yes , there have been tremendous advances in the manufacture of golf equipment-it 's been only twenty years since metal woods were developed-ind we 've paid for all of them . Drivers with graphite shafts and titanium inserts on the club face for $500 . Sets of irons for $1,500 . Wedges for $200 . Putters for $150 . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing better . So we talked with the titans of club design-the true innovators-and asked them about change . About what the most important innovations have been in the past quarter century , where technology will take us in the next few years , and why some things ( like scores ) never change . Our panel consisted of Ely Callaway , founder of the equipment company that bears his name ; John Solheim , CEO of Ping and son of **26;946;TOOLONG Karsten Solheim ; Arnold Palmer , not only one of the greatest golfers of all time but an inveterate tinkerer who makes and sells clubs under his own name ; Dick Rugge , vice-president of product creation at Taylor Made ; Nick Raffaele , manager of club development for Ben Hogan clubs ; Clay Long , head of research and development at Cobra Golf ; Jesse Ortiz , cochairman , club designer , and son of the founder of Orlimar Golf ; Barney Adams , president , club designer , and founder of Adams Golf , which makes Tight Lies clubs ; and David Glod , president , club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I first joined Taylor Made eleven years ago , " said Rugge , " I was one of three degreed engineers . At year 2000 , there are forty engineers at Taylor Made . Material science , dynamic analysis , structural analysis , aerodynamics , composite engineering-they 've all become as commonly used as swing weight and loft . " As the cold war ended , " Rugge continued , " the technologies developed and used over a forty-year period following World War II suddenly became available to the private sector . Golf clubs were one of the first sectors to access this knowledge . It 's obvious why this has happened : Both aerospace and golf have basically the same goal-to get something moving faster , higher , and farther through the atmosphere . " The first major accomplishment of this military-industrial-golf complex was the metal wood , a club that was revolutionary not because it suddenly added distance to players ' games but because it allowed for a uniformity in design and manufacture . " This was a change involving man over nature , " said Rugge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy of nature in creating woodtype clubs . In the same way that steel wrested away nature 's control of shaft construction , steel woods gave birth to a new freedom in club design . " " Metal woods are more consistent than traditional woods , " said Orlimar 's Ortiz . " There is no variation from head to head . Not all persimmon-wood heads are the same . " Ortiz is not , however , entirely giddy about a golf world ruled by Henry Ford principles of production . // The Ben Hogan Apex Plus iron ( part of set , $1,128 ) has the distinction of being forged . not cast , and also features perimeter weighting so that mere mortals can hit it . The Ping i3 Blade ( $110 per ) utilizes less offset to increase control of your shot . Using the same technology as in its metal woods , Taylor Made 's SuperSteel iron ( part of set , S960 ) has a thinner club face , allowing for more liberty in redistributing the weight around the club . // " Metal woods also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great loss for the game , " he noted . " I 've always held the belief that no metal wood is as good as a great traditional wood , but every metal wood is better than a bad traditional wood . Even more , combine the metal-wood club head with the advent of composite graphite and now you 're leaping ahead by light-years . " It was this innovation that led to significant increases in distance . " Along came oversized drivers-200 cc and up-in conjunction with longer shafts , " said Ortiz . " Suddenly , all golfers benefited from increased distance . " The pursuit of higher , longer , and straighter will never end , " he continued . " The " longer " part is getting pretty close to the limit , in my opinion . The USGA has made it clear to us manufacturers that it intends to keep a close eye on this portion of the equation . " Callaway added , " The potential for technological advances in the design of golf clubs , and the pleasure that those advances can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USGA does not prevail in restricting the technological advances in design . " There 's one more element to the club : the shaft , which , according to Rugge , is still in an infancy stage in terms of its development . " The shaft is still the most mysterious part of the golf club . Graphite shafts gave us the power to create shafts that are not possible with natural materials . Composite graphite is a designer 's dream in that it allows so much variation-variation that was utterly unthinkable with hickory or with a single material like steel . " One thing to keep in mind , however , is who 's using all this wizardry . That is , are clubs chock-full of the latest technology finding their way to the right golfers , or are we just grabbing the latest New Thing , regardless of whether it 's right for our style of play ? Adams remarked , " All the shafts , materials , and designs in the world are offset by clubs poorly matched to the golfer . " So how do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that assure that product is made to specific requirements , " answered Adams . " Think of every set as coming from a tour-van environment . " " Scientific analysis of the motion of club and player during the swing is much like the early microscopic analysis of pond water , " Rugge added . " Prior to the microscope , water was thought to be just water . The microscope uncovered a new world of heretofore unknown living creatures . Modern motion-analysis equipment is the microscope of the golf swing . Conventional wisdom will be pushed aside by real knowledge . This will lead to clubs that just work better for more golfers . " Palmer believes that we 're also on the verge of a return to some of the basics of club design . " Golfers eventually weed through the marketing hype of a product , design trends , and so forth . We saw this with the introduction of oversized woods and , more recently , the development of smaller fairway woods . No one can convince me that it is easier to get a larger golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smaller size . This has also been evident with oversized irons that are too big and feather-light golf clubs that are too light . What 's left to do ? Shaft development with design development could separate the real performers from the nonperformers . " Rugge : " It 's all in the materials and strategic placement of weight in the head . I think that might be the next wave of innovation : moving weight around within the club head . " If golf were merely a game about technology , we 'd be set . It 's not quite that simple . " Golf is a wondrous game . Very complex , " said Cobra 's Long . " Golf is a game of balance , of strength and weakness . Small people can hit the ball farther than big people . Short putts count the same as three-hundred-yard drives . Inner strength and tenacity count more than strength and talent . " " Golf is all about scoring , " said Ortiz . " All the great innovations over the past twenty-five years focus on distance first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when you improve your game from 125 yards in . If you ca n't chip , pitch , hit a decent wedge shot , or putt , no miracle driver , otherworldly fairway wood , or ' ' - new and improved ' 7-iron will improve your scoring . Technology will never be a substitute for skill , and the closer the ball gets to the hole , the more skill is valued over technology . " Expounding on the scoring angle , Raffaele said , " With all the technology in the last twenty years , why is it that the annual average score on the PGA Tour is relatively the same ? The ' ' 99 British Open winning score at Carnoustie by Paul Lawrie was 6 over par . In 1953 , with a persimmon driver , ' ' 53 ball technology , and the last thirty-six holes played in one day , with rain and wind , Ben Hogan shot 2 under par and the runner-up shot 2 over par . " The fact is , all the equipment in the world ca n't change the fundamentals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for us . " There are four games to learn in playing good golf , " he noted . " One , you must be able to play from the tee . This means a driver and/or woods . Two , you must have an iron game for approaches and must be able to judge distances and play the correct club accordingly . Three , you must be able to chip and putt . The short game is nothing at all like either the tee or the iron game . And four , the mental game is the most difficult part of golf . No equipment can help you here . It 's you against you . " Of all the aids that have been invented , developed , and designed , none is as important , both literally and figuratively , as the simple lesson of Keep Your Head Down . " Most of the improvements in golf have helped the average or weaker golfer gain greater distance , but you drive for show and putt for dough , " said Glod . " If someone could successfully market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better scores . " <p>
