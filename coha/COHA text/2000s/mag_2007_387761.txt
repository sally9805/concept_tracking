. Our reader panel test-fishes the new low-profile baitcasters . MANY INSHORE ANGLERS use freshwater bass reels in the salt because they 're smaller and weigh half as much as classic round baitcasters . When you 're going for the likes of redfish , snook , and small tarpon , these ergonomic reels are a real pleasure to cast all day . Unfortunately , there are trade-offs , including slow retrieval rates , low line capacity , and bearings that corrode in the salt . Tackle makers have addressed these problems with new , saltwater-grade , low-profile inshore reels . We asked four manufacturers to send us their latest models , priced between $100 and $150 . Each was rigged with 12-pound line and fished with jigs , stickbaits , and swimbaits . Reels were assessed for drag smoothness , balance , free-spool spin , brake engagement , and ease of adjustment . Here 's what we found . BEST OF THE TEST 1QUANTUM ACCURIST AC500PTS ( $120 ) OVERALL SCORE : 4 Stars CONTACT800-588-9030 ; quantumfishing.com THE LOWDOWNThe Accurist has a machined aluminum frame , a six-layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reel tested , it also had the fastest retrieve . And it 's backed with Quantum 's 24-hour repair guarantee . All four panelists loved this reel so much that they unanimously rated it No. 1 , something that rarely happens in our reader tests . Everyone liked the finish and agreed that the ACS II centrifugal brake system was flawless , handling a large variety of line strengths and bait weights with a minimum of adjustments . Sides , who took all the reels apart , said this one had the best design ( despite a few plastic parts ) . HITS " This reel will easily stand up to the salt . "  --  CORBETT " The ACS II cast control is extremely easy to adjust to changing wind and line conditions . "  --  PHILLIPS MISSES " I would like to see less plastic inside the reel .

There are six fully adjustable brake pins ; a soft rubber grip mat is located on the release bar ; and the handle has pliable oversize knobs mounted on ball-bearing stems . Our testers unanimously voted the Pflueger No. 2 , a rarer consensus than agreement for first place . All were impressed with the drag and backlash system . Britt was concerned , however , that saltwater might seep into the centrifuge mechanism over time . HITS " Love the wide spool and fat , easy-to-grip handles . "  --  BRITT " It has a very easy-to-change brake , with a cast that 's as smooth as silk . "  --  PHILLIPS MISSES " Reassembling the reel was somewhat difficult . "  --  SIDES " I did not like the silver color . A muted gray would have been much better . "  --  CORBETT BEARINGS : 10RATIO : 6.3:1CAPACITY : 12 lb. /160WEIGHT : 9.4 oz .

A cast-aluminum frame has the same profile as Daiwa 's well-known TDA baitcasting reel . The centrifugal brake system is highly resistant to saltwater intrusion . Our volunteers liked this system , but Britt ( who gave it his lowest score ) and Corbett complained about the shiny finish and had problems removing the side plate . Sides , our resident reel dismantler , felt the Daiwa could take serious abuse and keep working for a long time . HITS " There was absolutely no tendency to backlash , even in the wind . "  --  CORBETT " It cast lures farther than the Prodigy did , and the drag was very smooth . "  --  PHILLIPS MISSES " I found the side cover awkward to remove . "  --  CORBETT " The side plate was loose and would n't tighten up . "  --  BRITT BEARINGS : 6RATIO : 6.3:1CAPACITY : 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictable drag system , nothing touchy about it .

There is an easy-to-access side backlash control , a vented spool , and an open space in the reel foot for easy backlash removal . The Prodigy was the least expensive of the reels tested . Our panel saw value in its performance and felt that it might have scored much higher against counterparts closer in price . Corbett and Sides cited backlash problems . Britt felt this reel was a good deal and rated it slightly higher in performance than the Daiwa Coastal . The toughest criticisms were of the finish , which marred easily . HITS " With the control set on 10 , I could not throw a backlash no matter how hard I tried . "  --  PHILLIPS " A very smooth drag for a reel with this price .
