Chapter One Reserved Seating Chloe Parker would be a terrible role model if she were famous . Trouble is that she was about to be . It started innocently enough , or as innocent as you can get on the dance floor of one of the hottest clubs in L.A. The nightclubs of L.A. are like soap operas , except they 're not Days of Our Lives ; they 're more like Passions  --  crazy stuff happens , and no one bats a fake eyelash . There 's always some bizarre drama that plays out every night , and everyone in the cast  --  I mean , everyone  --  is great looking , stoned , and/or drunk . It 's like a traveling freak show that stars the youngest and hottest in Hollywood . It 's about fun , and sex , and pseudo-danger . Chloe Parker was practically born in a club . It 's like she spontaneously generated one night in 1981 during a fourteen-minute remix . As a child , she could dance before she could walk and sing before she could talk . Dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tangle of golden curls , Chloe was destined to haunt the clubs of her adoptive city as soon as humanly possible . Chloe had been going to the hottest clubs in Hollywood since she was this many , wearing L.A. Gear sneakers everywhere she went . Like me , Chloe has always been tiny , which meant we could both sneak into The Viper Room under the noses of the bouncers when we were thirteen . She was a kid partying with adults who treated her like a peer . Every important marker of her life had to do with clubbing . She wore her first bra to a club . She went out without a bra for the first time to a club . Her first kiss , her first crush on a gay guy , the first time she saw Jimmy Choo sandals , the first time someone passed her a joint  --  all happened in a club . As a kid , Chloe would stand behind the DJ booth and dance , and the DJ could tell if he had the vibe right just by monitoring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the ability to not only be in the moment , but to create it . It helped that she always gave herself little jobs to do to make everyone happier . She 'd hand out Dixie cups of water if people were looking overheated , or she would fan them with the sleeve of one of the 12-inch records the DJ was playing . She was the Disco Granny reincarnated . In those days , Chloe was like that  --  so pure , all heart and soul . To see her smile would have the same effect on a roomful of sweaty strangers as the DJ playing a classic , crowd-pleasing track . She could be like a little sliver of the sun  --  her glow lit them up . Chloe 's mailing address might have been her mom Peggy 's place in Bel Air , but the place to find her  --  and more importantly the place where she was finding herself  --  was whatever party was hottest at the moment . That night , it was Mode , a converted church on Cahuenga just north of Hollywood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chloe  --  a scary one . Chloe did n't need drugs to have fun . I mean , drugs would be double-bad for an addictive personality like hers , and I think she knew it . But she was drawn to them for the same reasons any young person may be  --  drugs seemed glam , and exciting , and reckless . Being high was intriguing ; it made her feel alive . Drugs were everywhere in every club . And drugs took the place of love . But along with whatever her other drugs du jour were , Chloe was as addicted to the club scene as she was a part of it . To get to our booth , Chloe aggressively stomped up the staircase of Mode , a multi-tiered architectural maze with flashing lights and music so loud it felt like it invaded you , like a virus . Just as everyone in L.A. had to climb the social ladder , Chloe and all the rest of us had to climb three flights of stairs to get to the VIP level at Mode . Sometimes , scaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up those stairs , which were usually choked with hangers-on , wasted fans , and undercover tabloid reporters . Chloe was n't nationally famous yet , but she was a glittering part of the youth party scene , and reporters were smart enough to know that where there 's smoke , there 's fire . On her way up the stairs , Chloe started to pass two Asian girls , one tall and the other short and squat , who were bobbing their heads to the end of Kanye West 's Golddigger . They both wore hip-huggers and expensive-looking belly shirts . They were not holding drinks , and their pupils were not dilated . Even in her chemically altered state , Chloe pegged them immediately : They were definitely magazine reporters . At Mode , people acted up , hooked up , and threw up , and the paparazzi stood outside to shoot the stars as they went in looking fabulous and staggered out totally gone . Guess which kinds of photos got published ? You 're right ! Both kinds got published . From what I heard , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty grand from a celebrity weekly . The price would triple if the photogs could shoot inside , but the iron-clad rule was no cameras and no reporters in the clubs . That was part of what stoked the glamour and mystery . No one really knew what went on inside . The doormen played , too . They were judge and jury when it came to letting people in and keeping people out . That meant the warm-up act for the freak show usually started outside . Guys with money ? Yup . But the doormen tried to keep the ratio of guys to girls at about ten to one . They wanted all the Brad Pitt wannabes to open their wallets while competing for the handful of Angelinas . Continues ...
