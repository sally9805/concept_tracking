HOME REPAIRS Headnote Yes , we 're all eager to spend what it takes to protect our biggest asset . Sometimes too eager . // SYBIL PRYOR THOUGHT SHE WAS GETTING a deal . Early last year , a contractor showed up at the 77-year-old 's Oakland , Calif , home and offered to install a new roof and and new siding . The cost ? Not to worry , he told her . All Pryor had to do was sign a few papers . Big mistake . The documents turned out to be for a home-equity loan , one that authorized a bank to pay out the proceeds of the loan-more than $90,000-directly to the contractor . You can probably guess how this story ends : Prosecutors say the contractor skipped out on the job the moment the loan check arrived . " It 's awful , but I probably see 20 of these cases every year , " says William Denny , the deputy district attorney on Pryor 's case . It 's not just the elderly and the poor who are victimized . Awash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripes are overly eager to protect and improve their investments . But good contractors are typically booked months in advance these days , making hurried owners especially juicy targets for home repair scamsters , incompetents and everyone in between . Consumer complaints about general contractors climbed 67% between 2000 and 2004 , according to the Better Business Bureau . Bruce Hahn , president of the advocacy group American Homeowners Grassroots Alliance , calls home improvement scams " a widespread problem-probably the single biggest source of complaints from our members . " Here are some of the most common and destructive swindles to watch for . SCAM 1 " Hello , We 're Working in the Neighborhood ... " It 's surprising how many people hire a stranger to do work that they 're going to have to live with ( and under ) for years . One pitch that 's particularly popular with the knock-on-the-door types : " We 've got a job down the street , and we noticed that your roof is missing some shingles . We have some leftover materials in the truck and can give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kicker : " We 'll just need a few hundred dollars to start . " Either they never return to do the job or the work is shoddy . Sometimes , says Sheila Adkins of the Better Business Bureau , " they 'll pull a bait and switch , telling the owner that they ran out of materials and need a lot more money to finish the job . " The most brazen of the bunch do what allegedly was done to Sybil Pryor : loot a target 's home equity . So how do you distinguish legit trades-people from scam artists ? First , never hire anyone who cold-calls you or shows up in person with a special deal on a new roof , deck or driveway . ( Even coupons in the mail from legitimate-sounding outfits should be treated skeptically . ) Good contractors are n't readily available on short notice , and they do n't spend time trolling neighborhoods for work . " They 're tied up in other jobs , " Adkins explains . With contractors and fix-it types , you want to find them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ask friends and neighbors whom they use and trust . ( Try posing the question this way : " Would you be happy to see them in your house again on another project ? " ) And if you 're new to the neighborhood , you 'll want to hit up your local home inspector or real estate agent for suggestions . But also remember : The best builders , plumbers and landscapers know one another . A trusted plumber can suggest a good tile installer for your bathroom makeover . SCAM 2 The Chimney Burn The dirtiest home scams prey on our deepest fears . That 's why chimney rip-offs are so widespread . After all , a faulty chimney can be fatal , causing house fires or carbon monoxide poisoning . A classic chimney scam , says Evan Grugett , a home inspector in Scarsdale , N.Y. , begins with a homeowner getting a coupon in the mail or seeing an ad in the Yellow Pages advertising a chimney cleaning for $45-about half what a legitimate chimney sweep would charge ( at least in suburban New York ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will report back that the chimney needs a new liner or other major repairs costing several thousand dollars . Horrified to learn that the family is at risk , the homeowner 's first instinct is to write a check . Always get a second opinion , preferably from a member of the National Chimney Sweep Guild ( ncsg.org ) or a state guild . Most of the guild members that Grugett knows use videoscopes that provide owners with photographic evidence of cracks or crumbling . The pros do n't expect you to take their word for it . SCAM 3 Pest Control That Swarms out of Control In much of the country , termites and other wood-eating pests are a homeowner 's worst enemy , causing $2 billion in damage each year , according to U.S. Forest Service researchers . Killing and containing termites is now a multibillion-dollar industry . But given how little most homeowners know about pest control , it 's no wonder that the industry itself is teeming with bad elements . Earlier this year , for instance , a MONEY writer received a $110 bill from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termite inspection had turned up " no activity . " Given that the inspection was done in the dead of winter with a foot of snow on the ground-conditions under which all but the hardiest bugs are inactive-the work was largely worthless . " You want to have them do the annual inspection when there 's the highest probability of finding termites , " says entomologist Roger Gold , a professor at Texas A &M; University . " Generally that means in the spring . " Gold knows of at least a dozen different pest-control rip-offs . One that really bugs him involves new construction . Research shows that people building new homes can greatly reduce the risk of termite infestation by pretreating the sill ( the first layer of wood atop a cement foundation ) . The chemicals themselves typically cost no less than 10 a square foot , yet it 's not uncommon for total bids ( chemicals plus labor ) to come in at 8 a square foot " That should tell you they 're not putting the chemical in , " says Gold . " Or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketed as termiteproof . " Termites wo n't eat metal studs or vinyl siding , " Gold notes slyly . " They 'll just eat everything around them . " The good guys do n't offer a permanent solution to what is inevitably an ongoing problem . SCAM 4 Pump You Up If you live in a rainy area , you may have had the misfortune of waking up to a soggy basement . Frustrating , especially since most insurance policies do n't cover basement water damage . Homeowners who consult basement-waterproofing companies are often sold on the virtues of sump pumps . While not truly a scam ( sump pumps do work , after all ) the installation of these expensive drainage systems may be a $9,000 solution to a problem that frequently can be fixed much more cheaply with better gutters , well-placed driveway drains or landscaping modifications that divert runoff away from the house . " You might be able to fix it on the outside for $3,000 , " suggests Grugett , " and still have money left over to get your gutters cleaned twice a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious dangers like radon and asbestos , you 're paying for a result-the removal of dangerous gases or airborne particles . But how to tell whether the work has been done correctly ? You must rely on the contractor 's assurances that a home 's radon or asbestos levels now test at or below federal standards . In a competitive market in which firms often win on price alone , that can lead to shortcuts . So demand copies of independent lab results before payment . And make sure bids are apples to apples . In the case of radon , better companies may charge more because they 're installing more extensive ventilation systems . Also be skeptical of lowball bids , a truism that applies to all home projects , not just radon and asbestos . The low bidder may intend to cut corners or use cruddy materials . If you 're installing a new roof , for example , ask the bidders for the brand names of the roofing materials they plan to use . With a little research ( Builderonline.com 's Product Guide , which rates builders ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can compare bids more effectively . Sidebar House Smarts Do n't wait for the contractor to come to you for these key jobs . * GUTTERS Water in your basement ? The problem may be your gutters . WHAT TO DO Clean them once or twice a year . WHAT ELSE Consider downspout extensions that carry water at least three feet away from your house . * TERMITES Most termite damage is invisible to the untrained eye . And in southern climes , a third of all homes have some termite damage . WHAT TO DO Get a professional inspection once a year . COST $75 to $100 * RADON is an odorless radioactive gas that 's a leading cause of lung cancer . Released by rocks and soil , it seeps into homes through basements . WHAT TO DO All homes with permanent foundations should be tested . COST $10 to $20 per kit * CHIMNEYS In some towns , the local fire department will inspect your chimney for free . WHAT TO DO An active fireplace should be cleaned every two years . COST $60 to $90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repairs Do ask friends and neighbors for recommendations when shopping for a contractor . If you 're in the process of buying , askyour home inspector for contractors and pest-control companies he recommends . In most states , inspectors ca n't collect referral fees from contractors , so odds are you 'll get an honest answer . Do make sure your contractor buys roofing , windows and other building materials that come with manufacturer 's warranties . But remember : The contractor and subcontractors must install the materials in the manner dictated by the warranty or the manufacturer will not be obligated to honor its promise . Do n't hire an inspector who 's popular with local real estate agents . The best inspectors are often despised by agents because they find problems that give buyers cold feet or spur them to renegotiate . Find credentialed local inspectors through the American Society of Home Inspectors ( ASHI ) at ashi.org . Do n't assume a licensed contractor is a good one . Warns Arizona inspector Coleman Greenberg , a former president of ASHI : " Being licensed does n't mean a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they passed a written test on contracting law-not that they know how to work a hammer .
