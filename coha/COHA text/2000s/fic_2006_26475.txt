The city of Charleston , South Carolina , has more ghosts than natives . But it is not quite true , as one rude tourist recently put it , that our ghosts  --  or , Apparition Americans , as they prefer to be called nowadays  --  show more life than their flesh and blood counterparts . I was not particularly surprised , therefore , to see a pirate hobbling down the alley behind my antiques shop , the Den of Antiquity . It happened one exceptionally foggy night in early April , when Mama and I were returning home from a musical recital at the College of Charleston . I 'd decided to stop by my shop on King Street to retrieve a book on antique canes that I had recently purchased . My plans for the remainder of my evening were to snuggle up in bed next to my handsome husband , Greg , and peruse the book while he watched the end of a basketball game . Mama 's plans were to curl up in front of her own TV and watch reruns of Leave It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparition American , I stomped on the brakes , and as soon as we 'd jerked to a stop , I flipped on the high beams . Unfortunately the light reflected off the moisture in the air , and in the split second it took to put the low beams back on , the ghost had disappeared . " Did you see that , Mama ? " " Abby , I 'm old , notblind . " " That was a pirate , was n't it ? " Mama sighed . " A very handsome pirate . If my arthritis was n't acting up , I 'd jump out and chase after him . Wherever it is he went . " My heart was still pounding , and my legs too weak to support my full weight , so I remained behind the wheel of my silver Mercedes . I did , however , drive the entire length of the Alley , and finding no one about , either spectral or real , hightailed it back to my house on Squiggle Lane . When Mama and I burst into the den @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , we must have brought with us a surge of intense energy . " So the concert was that good , " Greg said , without shifting his gaze . " The concert was just okay , " Mama said . " It 's the pirate who 's put the wind back in my bloomers . " I cringed . " Mama ! " " You have to admit it , Abby , he was really a hittie . " " The word 's hottie , Mama . " " That 's what you think . I meant what I said . If he was twenty years younger , I 'd hit on him . " " Mama ! " Despite the fact that my mother , who stands all of five feet tall , is trapped in a 1950s time warp along with June Cleaver , she at times displays disconcerting flashes of lust . If it were not for the fact that my minimadre is still a virgin  --  two children notwithstanding  --  and will forever stay that way , I assure you , I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt nauseous . " Abby , I 'm only human . " " No , you 're not . Besides , he was n't all that cute . " Greg pressed the mute button on his remote and jumped off the sofa . " What 's all this about a pirate ? Or did you say parrot ' ? " Meanwhile my sweetie pie jumped off the sofa as well , ambled toward me , and rubbed his cheeks against my calves . This sweetie pie , by the way , is my ten-pound orange tabby , who sometimes - responds to his name , Dmitri . Greg , on the other hand , seldom rubs his cheeks against my calves , and never responds to Dmitri . " We saw a ghost , " Mama said . " A really cute pirate . " " We saw an Apparition American and he was ugly enough to turn a train down a dirt road . " Dmitri purred loudly . Greg smiled . " As ugly as that ? " " Even uglier . I bet that when he was born his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He was six feet tall , " Mama said . " Just like Greg . And he had a huge black beard . " She gasped . " I bet it was the ghost of Blackbeard . " " He was no taller than you , Mama . And he did n't have a beard ; only stubble , and a scar that went from his left ear to his nostril . And those beady dark eyes  --  I 'll never forget them . He even had a wooden leg , Greg , just like the stereotype . " " Yes , he did have a wooden leg . " Mama agreed reluctantly . " But it was cute . " Greg laughed before kissing me on the mouth and then pecking Mama on the cheek . " Well , at least you two finally agree on something . " I bristled at what amounted to a dismissal . " I did n't say his leg was cute . " " But both of yours definitely are . " Greg winked before plopping back on the couch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch potato . I certainly did not begrudge him his method of relaxation . " What about mine ? " Mama demanded . I pushed her gently from the room . For much of the time since Daddy died nineteen years ago , hit in the head by a seagull with a brain tumor the size of a walnut , Mama has been competing with me for the attention of men . I 'm happily married again , and no longer competing , but I 'm not sure the message has really gotten through to Mama . " Abby , are you trying to get rid of your dear old mama ? " " Absolutely . " " Why I never ! " She stamped a petite pump and stalked dramatically to her very comfortably appointed room . One that I pay for , I might add . Greg waited until we could no longer hear her . " So , Mrs. Ghostbuster , what are your plans for the rest of the evening ? " " Well , I thought we would get ready for bed and then I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , but with all the excitement , I forgot to get the book from my shop . " " I have a better idea . What if we get ready for bed , and then instead of me watching the game , we come up with creative ways to use the bed that do n't involve sleep ? " Both Mama and the pirate were soon forgotten .
