amateur telescope making Headnote Assessing your scope 's state of cooling is the first step on the road to optimal performance . // PHYSICS PREDICTS THAT the aperture of a telescope will define its performance more than anything else . Yet it is an enduring mystery why the performance of Newtonian reflectors is so frequently disappointing when compared to high-quality refractors of similar aperture . Over the years many theories have been offered to account for the reflector 's failings . Everything from the effects of a central obstruction to surface roughness on the mirrors to spider diffraction to scatter in the reflective coatings has been suggested as a possible explanation , but when these are analyzed thoroughly they do n't fully account for the Newtonian 's temperamental behavior . However , some simple analytical techniques permit us to see what is really going on , and it is now clear that the single most important factor limiting performance is the design 's susceptibility to thermal problems . Most observers already know that Newtonians need some time outdoors to acclimate to the night air temperature . Conventional wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient time for the primary mirror to come to equilibrium with the night air or by storing the telescope in an unheated shelter . This is still good advice , but my tests show that these measures alone are far from adequate . As described in my September 2000 article ( " Understanding Thermal Behavior in Newtonian Reflectors , " page 125 ) , the schlieren test ( a close cousin to the more familiar Foucault knife-edge test used by mirror makers ) permits us to directly observe what is going on , and it reveals a persistent thermal chaos around the primary mirror with effects that are more damaging and long-lasting than most telescope users realize . While the most obvious manifestations of thermal instability subside after a relatively short period of time , the telescope will continue to suffer throughout the night from residual heat stored in the mirror and because of continually falling air temperatures . This latter point is seldom fully appreciated . Even a telescope that begins an observing session exactly at the ambient air temperature will soon begin to exhibit image degradation as the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature simply drops too rapidly after sunset for the mirror to keep up , let alone catch up . Identifying the Gremlins The phrase " thermal problems " means different things to different people . There are actually three sources of thermal-related image degradation : ( 1 ) the changing shape , or figure , of a cooling primary mirror ; ( 2 ) so-called tube currents , and ; ( 3 ) the thermal boundary layer . It is important to distinguish among these so that we can identify and correct the problems . A change in the figure of a cooling mirror is often cited as a major problem , but in reality this is so small in magnitude and duration that I regard it as the least significant of the three I have highlighted . The shape of a telescope mirror has to be accurate to within a few millionths of an inch for it to perform well , but when a warm mirror is suddenly placed into a cool environment , its shape changes , as the outer portion of the mirror cools slightly faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some volumetric change as a function of temperature . Fortunately , a significant change in figure for Pyrex telescope mirrors is usually short-lived and is almost never seen well into an observing session unless the ambient air temperature is falling at an unusually rapid rate . Photograph While a Newtonian reflector is capable of superb performance , its primary mirror must be at the same temperature as the outside air for it to realize its full potential . // Tube currents are caused by warm air rising off the primary mirror ( or other structural components ) , flowing up the inside tube wall , and being partially diverted into the telescope 's optical path . This causes the distorted star-test images usually seen right after the scope is taken outside . This condition will not persist for long either , since the primary mirror can not give up heat at the required high rate for more than a few minutes . Open-framework truss-tube telescopes typically are exempt from this problem . There is another potential source of tube currents unique to metal-tube telescopes . The outer surface of the tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiating heat into outer space ( the night sky ) , causing air near the inside tube wall to continually cool and mix with warmer air inside the tube . ( It is possible to directly observe these flows with the test I describe later in this article . ) This form of tube currents does have the potential to be long lasting , but it is also simple to fix by insulating the tube ( usually inside ) with cork or foam sheeting . The third phenomenon is the thermal boundary layer that develops on the face of the primary mirror while it gives off heat . This is by far the most serious of the three problems and deserves detailed attention if for no other reason than if you make improvements here , the other two thermal problems will mostly be solved as well . Getting to Know the Thermal Boundary Layer A boundary layer will exist on the surface of any solid body that is not at exactly the same temperature as the surrounding air . This is the zone in which the heat transfer takes place between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium . The boundary layer is optically problematic because it is characterized by a steep temperature gradient ( only 5 to 15 millimeters thick ) and will behave like a rough , irregularly shaped lens that refracts light from its intended path . What 's worse , in a Newtonian reflector the wavefront has to traverse this region twice - once on its way to the mirror and once on its way back toward focus . The boundary-layer problem is long-lasting because telescope mirrors have an unfortunate combination of properties - they store heat well and have poor thermal conductivity . This means that mirrors take a long time to release their stored heat , and more important , they lag behind any change in the ambient air temperature . This is the case regardless of the season since it is the change in temperature that is the source of the problem , not the actual temperature itself . Of the three problems outlined earlier , the thermal boundary layer is the toughest to solve , and both solid  --  tube and truss-tube designs are equally prone to suffer from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of these , heat radiating from the primary mirror to form a thermal boundary layer is the most important . It is worth noting that all three have as their cause a warm primary mirror . // These graphs show a 1-inch-thick primary mirror ( typical for a 6-inch reflector ) cooling . Left : The mirror begins the night 10 deg F warmer than the ambient air temperature , which remains unchanged during the course of the night . Even in these unrealistically favorable conditions , more than an hour passes before the temperature difference ( Delta ) T ) between the mirror and air is small enough for nearly optimal performance ( blue zone ) . Right : A slightly more realistic example showing the some mirror starting off 10 deg F warmer than ambient on a night when the temperature is dropping only 2 deg F per hour - typical for a mild summer evening . More than two hours must elapse before the telescope 's performance would be near optimum . These graphs were generated with data from Alan Adler 's Cool freeware , available at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubbed the rainbow schlieren because of its colorful appearance , can be used to quantify the peak-to  --  valley wavefront errors caused by the thermal boundary layer . This test shows how common it is for localized errors of 1/4 to I/10 wave to appear spontaneously , even when the mirror is just 2 deg C ( 3.6 deg F ) above the ambient air temperature . For mirrors left to cool on their own , this is a disturbingly common condition that will usually persist throughout the night . The structure of the boundary layer is irregular and in constant motion . The impact is a sporadic reduction in contrast across a wide range of spatial frequencies . Depending on the size and shape of the layer , the effect can vary from a smearing of fine planetary detail to unwanted light being spread across the field . Given the transient nature of the thermal boundary layer , it 's easy to see why it is n't better understood . Even without any remedial countermeasures , most Newtonian telescopes will occasionally perform superbly . Under the right conditions there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer are relatively laminar , and suddenly the image of a planet will appear crisp . The observer will then incorrectly assume that the telescope has reached thermal equilibrium , and blame an unsteady atmosphere when the view goes back to being mediocre , Mistaken identity is probably the real reason the boundary layer 's true impact on image quality has not been fully appreciated until recently . Seeing is Believing Photograph The boundary layer hugs the face of the primary mirror ( seen here edge-on in a schlieren test ) and persists as long as there is a temperature difference between the glass surface and surrounding air . The simulated telescope tube wall was placed above the cooling mirror to demonstrate how warm air rising off the mirror turns into tube currents . Photograph Left .

These individual frames were selected from a 10-second video sequence to illustrate how the structure of the boundary layer quickly changes . Note how the scale of the boundary-layer structure varies . ( The top of the mirror is up in these images. ) // Before attempting any fixes , it is necessary to have a truly objective and repeatable method to determine your telescope 's state of thermal equilibrium . Although the schlieren test setup I use is very sensitive and adept at revealing the boundary layer , it is n't suitable for field testing . Fortunately , it 's possible to see the boundary layer with a similar level of sensitivity by employing a derivative of the well-known star test . In fact , you 'll probably find the boundary-layer test even easier to perform . To see the thermal boundary layer in your telescope , insert an eyepiece that produces a magnification of 5 to 10 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower magnification than the standard star test uses ) . For example , in an 8-inch scope , 40x to Box is about right . Next , point your telescope at the brightest star in the sky , or even a bright planet like Jupiter or Venus . Rack the image out of focus until the secondary mirror and the spider begin to show in sharp silhouette against the bright , expanded disk of the illuminated primary mirror . Depending on your telescope 's focal ratio , you may be defocusing by a half inch or more - much more than for a normal star test . Hunt around a bit until you find a point where atmospheric turbulence becomes visible as a mottled shadow pattern moving in a swift , linear fashion . The speed of this pattern varies from night to night , and it 's easier to focus on when it is moving slower . If there are thermal problems within the telescope , you will see them superposed on this pattern as a blotchy shadow structure that moves much more slowly . These " thermal waves " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror and are caused by the thermal boundary layer hugging the face of the primary mirror . The first time you attempt this test it 's best to do it when you know your scope has thermal problems . Taking the telescope out on a cold winter night will guarantee the presence of conspicuous boundary  --  layer patterns for at least 30 minutes or Photograph Left .

( For fun , try placing your hand in front of your telescope if you want to see a really spectacular display ! ) As you gain experience with the test , you 'll be able to detect less-distinct patterns . If you find that the atmospheric messiness confuses you too much , the test can also be performed on a suitable terrestrial light source . A distant streetlight or other bright point source can be used as long as it is a few hundred meters distant . It is important that the light source be sufficiently small or else the contrast of the shadow patterns begins to decrease . In the absence of atmospheric turbulence , the test will now reveal even the smallest thermally induced optical errors .

Photograph Another way to monitor the thermal condition of your primary mirror is with an inexpensive indoor/outdoor digital thermometer . The " outdoor " probe is held against the back of the primary mirror with duct tape and covered with a layer of foam thick enough to isolate the probe from the ambient air . The thermometer box itself ( which contains the " indoor " sensor ) is attached to the outside of the telescope tube . This setup provides a handy means of comparing the temperature of the mirror with the ambient air temperature . When this photograph was taken , the ( Delta ) T was 26.9 deg F.
