bolted from the porch at their approach , not the least bit interested in going inside , where they had left her . The play they had seen had been by e. e. cummings , enacted entirely upon a stage floor slanted surreally towards the audience . Teresa was excited and tired at the same time by so many words that were so difficult to understand . <p> " Here , Frida , " she said , worried at the cat 's behavior , even though she was , as a rule , antisocial . But Frida would have none of it . <p> The front door swung open onto a nearly empty living room . The newly purchased carpets were gone , the footstool turned over . The remaining furniture huddled in a corner like dejected sheep , a long scrape across the floor where the rocking chair had been dragged . Most noticeably , the gramophone with its oak horn was missing . They had been robbed . Only the good stuff had been taken , not the out-of-date stereo or the watercolors on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wallet , which she had left in her purse hanging from the coatrack , was missing as well . <p> A month earlier , someone had worked a long time to meticulously remove the new radio and speakers from their ancient Volvo . When they had gone outside the next day , the windows on the car had been all steamed up . They had now been in town three months , slowly trying to adapt to the newfound prosperity that came with John 's job . Welcome to Seattle . <p> Wary of disturbing the burglar , Teresa and John stalked carefully through the house , discovering the window that had been forced up , the backdoor that stood wide open to the chill night air . <p> The police came a little while later . <p> " There have been several burglaries like this in your neighborhood , " said the officer . " A woman hires a few teenagers to take antiques and carpets . She pulls a van into the alley , loads up , fences it in Vancouver . The kids get to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here in ten minutes . " <p> " Do you know who she is ? " <p> " We have a pretty good idea , " he said , but did n't elaborate . <p> The policeman took down the information in a perfunctory manner . Something about his attitude made it clear that they should not expect to see their belongings anytime soon . <p> " Make a list of what was taken , " he said . " It will probably take you a couple of days to get it sorted out . " He placed a call before he left , looked briefly animated before hanging up . <p> " Your wallet 's been found , " he said , " at a local grocery store . Someone found it on the sidewalk and turned it in . I 'll be right back . " <p> While he was gone , John and Teresa ventured upstairs . Some of her jewelry was missing , in a haphazard sort of way-no attention paid to what might be more valuable . None of it was worth much , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . She took off her dress and put on jeans before the officer returned . By now both she and John were tired and buzzed at the same time  --  the rush of adrenaline at the danger they had eluded . <p> The policeman returned with Teresa 's wallet . The cash was missing , but her one credit card remained . Oddly , her driver 's license was gone as well . <p> " Definitely kids , " said the policeman . " They 'll use it for fake ID . " <p> The return of the credit card was a source of great relief . They had already envisioned bills coming in from car dealers and hotels and stereo stores . Numerous letters and phone calls . Having to reestablish credit . <p> " At least we were gone when they came , " said Teresa . " What if we had been here ? What if they were armed ? " <p> " They probably watched the house , " said John . " They knew when we were gone . " <p> " But why us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . Now , we do n't have anything worth stealing . " <p> And it was true . The more she thought about that , over the next few days , as they compiled their list for the police and the insurance company , the more of a comfort it became . Relieved of their beautiful new carpets , carpets they had spent almost two hours picking out at a downtown store , their footsteps echoed on the wood floors . The house , which had just begun to lose its new-house feel , returned to a sort of Zen aestheticism , stripped down to its essentials . <p> Upon looking it up in Kovel 's , they discovered that the gramophone was the single most valuable thing they had owned . <p> " That 's probably what made them break in , " said John . " You could see the gramophone from the front window . " <p> " You could see the carpets , too , " said Teresa . <p> " Yeah , but it was the gramophone that made them think we might have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank tea in the open front room while the cat lay in a patch of sunlight . The clean oak floors looked enormous without carpets . John spent the day drilling and filing until he had installed deadbolts on the front and back doors . When he was done , it took two keys to get into the house . He hammered metal stops into the ground-floor window frames to keep the double-hung windows from being opened more than a few inches . <p> " There , " he said , surveying his work with satisfaction . " Now they 'll have to break a window to get in . " <p> They debated the merits of an electronic security system , and John began to gather brochures on them , which he studied in the evenings as though cramming for a test . <p> At night , Teresa wondered if someone was watching the house . Maybe there was a bulletin board for burglars , one that said which houses had been hit recently , so that others would n't bother . She thought about the girl who must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shoplifting things . Bouncers at the clubs would come to recognize her , bar her at the door : " Yeah , that Teresa chick is really wild . Started a fight here last weekend . Do n't let her in , or her friends , either . " <p> After two weeks , they called the police to see if there had been any progress . <p> No , they were told , but there had been another robbery just like theirs about a block away . Carpets and antiques . The ring was still operating . Chances are , they said , that your stuff is long gone , somewhere in Canada . <p> " I 'll bet they did n't even look for it , " said John . He felt bad about the gramophone . It had belonged to his grandmother . The burglars had left the small , heavy records , the carefully preserved manual , and the extra needles behind . Teresa had liked to listen to a recording of a man imitating birds , especially " Nights Sounds of the Okefenokee Swamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the accessories , " said John . Like his grandmother , who had been a librarian , John kept everything . Stealing the gramophone without the records did n't make any sense to him , like stealing a car without the tires . He was still recovering from losing his car radio . <p> They had returned once to look at carpets in the downtown store , after the check came from the insurance company , but had n't seen any they liked . The ones they had originally purchased , it turned out , had been unusual , in darker colors with animal designs . Already , Teresa missed the roaming deer , the fanciful creatures that had populated the borders of the carpets . She was not ready to welcome another set of carpets into her front room . Standing in the showroom , too hot in her winter coat , Teresa felt that she was about to cry . <p> " Do you understand ? " she said to John when the impatient salesman was distracted by another customer who was ready to buy . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hurry . " <p> One small carpet had been left behind , a wool rug that had been in front of the window forced open with the neighbor 's shovel . Teresa would have put it in the front room , just to break up the space , but a great , dark , greasy boot print marred the tan surface . <p> " Maybe we could trace them with this boot print , " said Teresa , jokingly . " Match it to another burglary . " <p> They sent it to be cleaned , but the dark mark remained . The stain lingered long after the event , a constant reminder , thought Teresa , that to others , your home is just another house . <p> She dreamed one night of the other Teresa , the girl who must be using her driver 's license . She dreamed that this Teresa , a teenaged girl , walked into the house one night , just opened the door and walked in . She came upstairs to where Teresa and John lay sleeping fretfully in their bed , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earrings that had been taken in the burglary , the ones from Mexico City with the tiny jade stones . On her hands she wore many rings , rings from other burglaries . She opened the closet and took out some of Teresa 's clothes , held them up , and admired herself in the mirror on the inside of the door . Then she took off her own jacket and put on some of Teresa 's things before leaving . <p> When Teresa got up the next morning , she opened the closet door , fully expecting to find a strange jacket crumpled there . But nothing was missing , nothing new was in its place-only the sleepy , puzzled look on her own face in the mirror as she stood in her nightgown , tugging at her earlobe , as though trying to remember something she had forgotten . <p> The next day , Teresa got home from work and cleaned out her closet . Out with the flowered dresses , the red cardigan with gold trim on the front . She left a few black skirts and jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything else filled bags and bags . She had always liked clothes . <p> " What 's all this ? " asked John when he came in and stepped across the grocery sacks in the hallway . " Are we moving again ? " <p> " No , " said Teresa . " I 'm just getting rid of a few things . Things that I 'll never wear in Seattle . " <p> Every night before he went to bed , John checked all the locks and deadbolts . He checked to see that the windows on the ground floor were secure . He locked the garage from inside , then the fire door between the garage and the basement . At the top of the basement stairs he locked the door to the kitchen . <p> " What if there 's a fire , " asked Teresa , " and I 'm in the middle of doing laundry ? " <p> " If you 're in the basement , you 'll have this door unlatched . Besides , you can always go out through the garage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 've gone out the front door , leaving the basement door locked , and the car catches on fire in the garage ? " <p> " Then you can close the fire door and call the fire department . " <p> " What if the cat is in the garage ? " <p> John looked at her . " Believe me , if the car catches on fire , the cat will not stay in the garage . " <p> Teresa left the house before John in the morning to beat the traffic to the Eastside . After the second time that she left the door unlocked behind her , John asked if this was going to become a habit . <p> " Well , you 're still here , " she said . " What 's the big deal ? " <p> " What if they come back ? " <p> " The burglars ? At seven o'clock in the morning ? For what ? " <p> " There are prowlers at all hours , looking for unlocked doors . " <p> Teresa looked at him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if it makes you feel better , I will lock the door . " <p> " Good , " he said . <p> " You 've changed , " said Teresa . <p> " So have you , " said John . " You always wear black . " <p> It was true . Teresa had even started painting her nails black . She had always worn bright colors before , assuming they flattered her honey-colored skin . <p> She shrugged . " It 's different here . The light is different . " <p> One day , instead of going straight home from work , Teresa stopped at a neighborhood place that served beer and burgers . She ordered a glass of wine and sat staring idly at the heavy traffic on Lake City Way . It was always rush hour in Seattle . <p> " Teresa ! " called the man behind the bar , and she jerked her head around . But he was talking to someone else . A girl came from the other end of the room , where she had been setting up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tavern . Unless , of course , she had a fake ID to get the job . Teresa 's hands began to tingle . <p> She looked at her glass , then stared at the girl when she passed nearby . What was she looking for ? To see if they looked alike ? She found herself looking at the girl 's hands and wrists , looking for her own jewelry . The girl had an intensely bored look on her face . She had dark hair like Teresa 's , but wore a stud in her nostril . Definitely younger . <p> " How come you 're home so late these days ? " asked John when Teresa let herself into the house . <p> " We 're on a deadline , " she said . It was true , but she had still been going to the tavern after work . It seemed a stupid thing to say to John , I 'm watching a girl who might be me . <p> She always paid cash . Teresa did n't want to have whoever waited on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spelled the same way . " The girl herself sometimes came to her table . She seemed unremarkable in every way , this other self , but Teresa eventually heard her mention a club to some people where she and her friends liked to go . <p> One night when John was out of town , Teresa found herself getting in her car and driving downtown . On First Avenue , she spotted the place and looked for parking . It took a while , and when she emerged from her car a couple of blocks away , Teresa put on the glasses she normally used just for working on her computer . I have a right to be here , she kept telling herself . So what if she recognizes me ? <p> Teresa stayed until closing , accepting cigarettes from young people with shaved heads  --  she could n't tell if they were boys or girls  --  oddly soothed by the trance or house music , whatever it was called . The electronic nature of it , the samples of things strangely familiar yet not , put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Teresa forgot to look for the girl and her friends , did not know if she would have recognized her . She could not remember the last time she had closed a place down . <p> Back at her car , Teresa could not find her keys . She began to panic , but everything else was in her purse  --  wallet , cell phone , datebook . She pressed her face against the window to see if her keys were inside . There they were  --  sitting in plain view on the car seat . She must have set them down to take out her glasses , locking the doors with the button . As she stood there , a cab cruised by , and Teresa hailed it to take her home . She was suddenly too tired to deal with the car . She would get it in the morning . Teresa dreaded trying to explain this to John , who viewed every mistake , every slip in security , as a personal affront . Maybe she just would n't tell him , she thought . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get in , but she had the cab drop her off , anyway . <p> Teresa walked between the houses to the alley , then wandered down to the end . She had a vague plan , something that had occurred to her during the nights since the burglary . In the light of the streetlamps , everything looked transformed , comforting in an otherworldly sort of way , with the neighbors sleeping all around her . Sure enough , at the end of the block , Sylvia , the unofficial mayor of the neighborhood , had left a ladder leaning against the side of her garage . Lifting it and staggering a little , trying to keep her purse from sliding off her shoulder , Teresa carried it back to her house and placed it against the back wall . She climbed on the roof and pushed up the window she had left unlocked during the heat of the day . <p> Triumphantly , she climbed in , went downstairs , and returned the ladder to the neighbor . She would have to tell Sylvia not to leave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climbed the stairs , removing her now filthy clothes as she went . Entering the bedroom , she was shocked to see a form in the bed . She froze at the door , then looked carefully at the still figure . It was John . <p> He must have come back early , she thought . He could have let her in all along . He looked so peaceful lying there , so vulnerable , the side of his face pressed trustingly into his pillow . She had climbed in the window at the end of the hall making all sorts of noise , and he had slept through it . He must be really tired , she thought . It reminded her of a painting she had seen once , of a man asleep in the desert while a lion watched him . The lion looked benevolent , but the man looked so  --  alone . <p> Teresa felt wonder and a sort of elation as she carefully settled into bed . It was almost three o'clock , and she would hate herself when she had to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was insane when he found out . But for now , Teresa marveled at her discovery , at how easy it was . It was so easy to be somebody else . <p> <p> By Kathleen Alcala <p>
