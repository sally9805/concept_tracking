HOME PCs BestHardwareBuys THE BLAND BEIGE PC sitting on your home office desk is so 1989 . These days , home computers are dressed in black , silver , and even bright blue , and their snazziness goes beyond appearance . Many of the latest PCs-with big LCD monitors , recordable DVD drives , and thundering speakers  --  can stand in as a one-stop entertainment system . Photograph LOOK INSIDE : Cyberpower 's Titanium Garner Force Pro has a clear panel . Photograph A TV AND A PC : HP 's Media Center 883n comes with a built-in TV tuner card . // Today 's turbo-charged home PCs make games and DVDs come alive , while lesspowerful machines deliver good value and plenty of oomph for garden-variety productivity tasks . We looked at ten systems ideal for the home user , divided into three categories : gaming , entertainment , and general-purpose productivity . PCs in each category have to meet baseline requirements-for example , you ca n't edit tape from your camcorder on a system that lacks the proper ports , and playing action games is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as you can shoot . To test system performance , we ran our PC WorldBench 4 benchmark ; we also blasted game sound tracks and music on their speakers , studied their screens for signs of stuttering while playing videos , and ferreted out useful ports . We learned that you wo n't have to buy a separate system for each different use-all the PCs here have enough power to double or triple up on tasks , and they all have some capacity to receive upgrades . Entertainment AS DIGITAL VIDEO , photography , and music proliferate , more people want a PC that acts as an editing station and a mixing board . You need a massive , high-throughput hard drive to access and store huge video and image files ; plenty of memory to use in manipulating them ; a wealth of ports to import data from cameras and music devices ; and ports and drives to use in exporting your finished work to such devices and storage media as your TV screen , videotape , and writable DVD . Photograph DELL 'S ' Dimension 3250 has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three Popular Flavors // We looked at three media-savvy PCs : the Dell Dimension 8250 , the Gateway 700X , and the HP Media Center 883n-the first system to run Microsoft 's new XP Media Center . We also looked at a midrange , 17-inch , wide-screen IMac . The three Windows systems have one major trait in common : They 're quite expensive . ( Apple 's IMac , at $1999 , costs about a grand less . ) The three Windows machines each carry two optical drives , including a rewritable DVD drive . And each has a 120GB hard drive for storing your digital library . When that fills up , you can add a second hard drive to the Gateway or the Dell . For its part , HP 's system is better equipped to talk to external devices than the others : Though all three systems have several USB 2.0 ports and at least one FireWire port , the HP adds card readers for all common flash media formats ; and instead of offering one TV/VCR composite port , it has two . // FEATURES COMPARISON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HP system enables you to do more than merely create digital content : It also gives you new ways to luxuriate in it . You can hook up your television cable to the PC and use an included remote control to download television schedules from the Web , channel-surf , and record shows using a TV-tuner video card in TiVo fashion . Or wield the remote to launch My TV , My Music , My Pictures , and other HP programs from the Windows XP Media Center shell : Simple , hierarchical menus allow you to operate all these programs with one busy ( and tired ) thumb . Though they ca n't process a TV signal or certain features of Windows XP Media Center , the Gateway and Dell computers pack some video-savvy software . Gateway totes a full copy of Pinnacle Systems ' feature-laden Studio 7 movie creation software and a great 300-page primer on digital video ; Dell brings the lesspowerful but still-capable MGI VideoWave 4 . The Dell and the HP delivered comparable performance , earning PC WorldBench 4 scores of 121 and 120 , respectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory , the Gateway finished 8 points ( over 6 percent ) behind the Dell . SOUND AND VISION WHEN YOU 'RE CORRECTING COLORS in photos or testing transitions between video clips , you need a display that you can look at for hours on end . Among the four PCs in our entertainment category , the 700X 's monitor takes the prize : Gateway 's FPD1810 , an 18-inch LCD equipped with a digital video interface , rendered near-perfect text , even at small type sizes . It also played movies at full screen with no flicker or shimmer . Photograph GO WIDE : Apple 's IMac features a roomy 17-inch LCD . Photograph THE GATEWAY 700X includesediting guide . // The Dimension 8250 we looked at came with Dell 's P1130 21inch CRT . The monitor produced rich , warm colors , along with subtle shading and detail on games and digital video . At default settings , however , the contrast was somewhat weak , which made text appear slightly out of focus . The HP 's 17-inch Pavilion F70 LCD screen has both analog and DVI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board offers only analog out . The F70 's text looked somewhat grayish and broken up compared with that of the other monitors . The HP stumbles a bit on digital video , too : Even at half-screen size it flattens colors to preserve detail , and it produced somewhat blocky fast-motion video . The Gateway and HP LCDs are certainly more space-efficient than Dell 's CRT , which is 20 inches wide by 20 inches deep . On the other hand , Dell 's monitor supplies so much real estate that you can work comfortably at 1600 by 1200 resolution , which the graphics card supports at 85 Hz . Another important question is , how loud do you like your audio ? Built in to the base of HP 's LCD are tiny Polk Audio speakers that distort when turned up past conversational volume . In contrast , the Gateway 's Boston Acoustic BA7800 4.1 speaker system sounds beautiful at medium volume , and it can really crank out the sound . Dell 's 5.1 Altec Lansing ADA995 speaker set includes a huge subwoofer with its own volume control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treble and bass sounded clear and lively . Since all three are similarly pricey , it 's difficult to pick a winner . The HP 's XP Media Center interface shows off the integration of PC and TV , but as a PC or video-editing station it 's unremarkable . The Dell offers the greatest raw power but the weakest digital-media-specific capabilities . So overall , despite its somewhat lagging performance , we would put our money on Gateway 's 700X , which excels with its beautiful display and helpful video-editing guide . IMAC INTERLUDE FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE the Mac platform and the loads of software that Apple always includes , the IMac could be the right choice . Its bowl-shaped base supports a permanently attached 17-inch , 1440-by-900-pixel LCD on an articulated stalk that can tilt and rise independently . The base sports Apple 's SuperDrive in the front ( DVD-R/CD-RW ) ; and in the back , FireWire and USB 1.1 ports . It has only one optical drive , and it supplies no bays for adding another . Our test unit had just 256MB of memory ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , spherical speakers rest unstably on rubber rings , and their audio managed to sound both tinny and muddy . The IMac 's screen operates in landscape mode by default . It displays bright color and clean , crisp text . The NVidia GeForce4 MX 420 graphics controller , which has only 32MB of memory , makes full-screen movies look unimpressive and jumpy , but at the default size of 8.5 by 3.75 inches , movies played well . Of course , Apple always devotes as much attention to software as it does to hardware , and this IMac comes with several Apple programs . IMovie , a timelinebased video-editing program , is so easy to use that a kid could figure it out , yet it 's sophisticated enough to produce a competent digital movie . The IPhoto application archives digital photos and lets you share them on the Web . And in case you decide to use your computer for something practical , Apple throws in a copy of AppleWorks-a productivity package along the lines of Microsoft Works-and some kid-friendly games . 00 . Gaming SERIOUS GAMERS seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graphics subsystem to blast frames on the screen and a sound system to shake the walls . We tested two gaming machines from opposite ends of the price spectrum : Voodoo 's $3499 Egad V28400 and Cyberpower 's $1299 Titanium Garner Force Pro . Our Cyberpower Titanium 's blue case has a dear plastic window on one side that allows you to view its interior , which is lit up by a neon tube . Voodoo 's Egad V28400 does n't bother with flashy decoration , though its burnished black all-steel case looks sleek and confident . Photograph " VOODOO 'S Egad V28400 also sports media slot . // Both test systems came with 512MB of memory and an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro graphics board loaded with 128MB of video memory . The Cyberpower Titanium ran on a 1.8-GHz AMD Athlon XP 2200+ processor , while the Voodoo relied on a 2.8-GHz Intel Pentium 4 to earn the highest PC WorldBench 4 score ( 124 ) of any system in this review . We ran our game tests at a resolution of 1280 by 1024 with 32bit color depth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid off . It displayed Return to Castle Wolfenstein at 93 frames per second-compared with the 63 fps managed by the Cyberpower Titanium . ( Frame rates above 60 fps are considered flicker-free ; both systems performed admirably at this demanding setting . ) We marveled at the subtle shading and uncanny depth maintained on both systems , even during firefight scenes . The Cyberpower 's Creative Labs Inspire 5.1 surround-sound speakers rocked the house . Meanwhile , a dead sound port on our test Voodoo PC sidelined two of the four Klipsch ProMedia speakers in its sound system . But even with just two speakers and a subwoofer functioning , it sounded rich and powerful . Both systems are also well equipped for everyday computing . The Cyberpower 's 19-inch ViewSonic E90F monitor displays crisp text even at very small font sizes . The Voodoo 's 19-inch NEC MultiSync FE991SB rendered readable-albeit slightly blotchy-text . The Cyberpower 's monitor , in contrast , displayed all of its blotchiness on the outside : The monitor and some other components were messily spray-painted to match the navy blue case , giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have kept to a $1299 price while putting all the components in special dyed , injectionmolded cases with custommade faceplates . So is the Voodoo Egad V28400 worth $2200 more than the Cyberpower Titanium Garner Force Pro ? The Voodoo 's processing muscle will keep it current longer with the next wave of games . But the Cyberpower has plenty of power too , and it 's definitely a better deal-if you do n't mind the sloppy paint job . General-Purpose Photograph COMPAQ 'S Presario 6000 is a strong performer . Photograph THE EMACHINES T2200 has a big hard drive . // General-Purpose MAYBE YOU NEED A COMPUTER just for sending e-mail and doing research on the Internet , or for those nights when you bring your spreadsheets home . If so , you can skip the custom-painted , neonilluminated box and the big LCD screen and save a lot of money without sacrificing computing capability . We looked at efficient productivity PCs from Compaq , Dell , Emachines , and Gateway that range in price from $959 to $1266 with monitor . Your first concern about a basic system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're fast enough to run a spreadsheet , or even a photo editor . The $1266 Compaq Presario 6000 ( with a 1.8-GHz Athlon XP 2200+ processor and 256MB of memory ) and the $1229 Dell Dimension 4550 ( with a 2.4-GHz Pentium 4 and 256MB of memory ) both earned PC WorldBench 4 scores only several points behind the fastest systems tested in this review . The $968 Emachines T2200 has the same processor as the Presario 6000 and carries twice the memory , but came in about 15 percent slower ; meanwhile , the $959 Gateway 3005 ran approximately 23 percent slower . But that 23 percent spread in benchmark scores looks bigger on paper than it feels when you 're using productivity applications . The few instances when you might notice the low-cost systems ' performance lag are while playing games or watching DVDs . The Emachines T2200 and the Gateway 300X , which use integrated graphics chips , lack dedicated graphics memory ; unfortunately , however , even the Dell 's and Compaq 's standalone graphics boards deliver choppy motion and jaggy textures . WHAT 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on games-not DVD movies-because it has no DVD player , just a CD-RW drive . ( Springing for a DVD-ROM drive adds $20 to the price . ) The Compaq , Emachines , and Gateway units all have separate DVD-ROM and CD-RW drives . For downloading video from your digital camcorder , Emachines gives you three FireWire ports , and Compaq provides one . Emachines also supplies a 100GB hard drive , which is big enough to hold some digitized video . The Compaq and Dell PCs have 40GB hard drives , and the Gateway hard drive is only 20GB ; you may want to supplement their storage capacity with another hard drive . Fortunately , all four systems leave an internal drive bay open-though getting at the Compaq 's bay is a chore-and several USB 2.0 ports that you could use to connect an external drive . Because the monitor is a PC 's most expensive component , that 's where makers of low-cost systems usually try to economize . All four of our test machines came with 17-inch , housebrand CRT monitors . Compaq 's FS 7550 screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered a decidedly muddy picture at its default settings , and appeared overexposed with the brightness turned up ; Gateway 's EV700 rendered particularly weak and blurry text . Dell 's M782 came through with the best image quality of the lot , especially for e-mail , Nospreadsheets , and other eyeball-intensive work : Text looked fairly sharp , but colors were somewhat muted . All four of these systems offer a fair deal for the price , but the Compaq Presario 6000 really delivers on performance . We just wish it had a better monitor . If you decide to buy the 6000 , you 'll probably want to pair it with another display . So which activity is it going to be-gaming , filmmaking , Web surfing , or all three ? By picking an appropriately configured PC , you can make it easier to pursue whichever pastime you choose . Our advice : Give strong consideration to types of tasks you 'll be performing , and shop accordingly . Often , a gaming system can serve as a competent video-editing system as well , and many video-editing machines-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound for your favorite games . By choosing the right PC carefully , you can ensure that your system wo n't be a one-trick pony . After all , even the most devoted video editor enjoys relaxing with a game once in a while . // PERSONALITY PROFILES Configuration Checklist : Pick the Right PC DOUBTLESS , YOU ALREADY know what you want to be able to do with you next home PC . But what configuration will do the best job for you-both today and a year or two down the road ? Here 's a checklist of recommended specifications for four common types of home PC : gaming , video and image editing , music and movies , and basic productivity . Treat these specs as reference guidelines when you shop for your next PC . And do n't forget to take future uses into account-you might live for gaming today , but in a couple of years , additions to the family may turn you into a budding videographer . Depending on how generous your budget is , you may have to make some compromises between your lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how much money you can afford to spend . FINDING CORNERS TO CUT WHERE SHOULD YOU LOOK for places to cut ? The monitor makes a good starting point : Picking a smaller screen can save you substantial money , as can sticking with a CRT rather than upgrading to an oh-sodesirable LCD flat-panel . Downgrading your processor to a model that 's a step or two lower than the fastest CPU available is another relatively painless way to save a couple of hundred dollars . Also , do you really need 5.1 surroundsound speakers with a subwoofer the size of a big dog ? And how large a hard drive do you require ? You wo n't want to undertake even general-purpose computing ( surfing the Web and using office productivity applications ) with less than 2068 , but anything over 80GB is probably overkill . Where you should n't compromise is on service ( see our story on page 143 ) . If your PC has a one-year warranty and the vendor offers a three-year upgrade , paying the difference is almost always worthwhile . ( That piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrades offered by retail stores , however . ) Sidebar MOBILE HOME PC Sidebar Should Your Next Home PC Be a Notebook ? Sidebar MY CURRENT HOME COMPUTER is a notebook , and I 'll never go back to using a desktop . Partly I 'm attracted by the aesthetics of mini-PCs , but mostly I love the freedom to work wherever I please . Five days a week , I use a desktop PC in my PC World office . When I 'm at home , the last thing I want to do is sit isolated in my home office , just so I can Web-surf and return e-mail . I 'd much rather slouch in my big living room chair , where I can take part in conversations . And because I 've installed a home network with a Wi-Fi ( 802. llb ) wireless access point , I can do just that . Using a notebook at home has other charms . It 's no longer an inconvenience to clear out of my office so that it can serve its other purpose as a guest room . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with all the applications and files I 've been using at home . Hauling my 7-pound notebook through airports is no picnic , but I do n't mind Sidebar doing it occasionally . ( If I traveled often , I 'd probably buy one of the new , tiny ultraportables . ) Using a notebook at home has its co promises . My desktop-replacement-size notebook has all the computing power I need for now , and its screen is big enough for comfortable use over long stretches . But some components are getting outdated , and upgrading them is an expensive proposition . Sure , I might be able to ship my system back to its maker , wait a couple of weeks , and pay through the nose for those upgrades , but instead I 'll live with the 20GB hard drive and use an external CDRW drive for backups . When it 's time to replace my notebook , I 'm willing to pay the $200 to $300 difference between a power notebook and a power desktop in return for the freedom to set up wherever I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship , and I 'm committed to this one . - Rebecca Freed Author Affiliation Dan Littman is a contributing editor and Rebecca Freed is a senior editor for PC World . // <p>
