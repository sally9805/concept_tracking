Photograph And then ? Photograph Well , of course , that was just the beginning . We asked Nortel to do a study about the costs of creating the network . We talked to GTE . We hoped one of them would be our partner and invest in this idea of a Congolese GSM network . But eventually I had to be honest with myself ; I had to accept that no vendor was going to put money in Congo . I went home ; I asked my wife . The only savings I had was $1.5 million . She said I should follow my heart . That was so dear , so dear to me and painful . In the end , I went with Nortel . I went to Paris . I carried my checkbook with me . How did you feel writing a personal check for so large a sum ? After I wrote the check , Nortel threw a party with champagne . All the Nortel executives in France were there . They wanted to know : who is the man behind this thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give me a glass of champagne . I said I needed water . I told him , " The day my network is done I 'll drink something , and not before . " After you 'd spent your savings , you still needed capital for staff , vehicles , offices , and so on . What did you do ? I sold everything : my coffee trucks , my personal car , everything . We never had enough money in the beginning . At one point , I had to tell everyone who worked for us that I could n't pay their salaries , but if we stuck together we would be all right in the future . You know , most stayed ! And today , they 've all bought houses . Tell me about how you finally launched the Congolese Wireless Network . The day before , tests had been going fine . I go to see the switch . I 'd put it in a modern one-bedroom apartment in Kinshasa , because it would be safe there . But when I walk in the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working ! CWN is due to be announced the next morning , at 11:00 a.m. on February 20 , 1999 . The engineers work all night ; I had a Congolese grilled-meat dinner brought to them . But Saturday morning it 's still not working . The whole government has come to the ceremony at the Hotel Memling in Kinshasa . Every embassy is there . But I 'm still sitting in my office . I have a GSM phone in one hand and an analog phone in the other , and I 'm talking to the engineers on the analog . It 's 20 minutes to 11:00 a.m . I joined the minister and his delegation . Now he 's worried , too . He 's asking , " Should we postpone ? " I say , " No , no . It 's going to work fine . " So , at five minutes to 11 , we go into the hall . We sit down on a sort of stage . The state minister representing the president of the republic is there . The Nortel representative is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on the shoulder and saying , " Conteh , can we stop this ? " I think , if I panic , it is finished . And if I do n't operate the network today , it 's finished , too . Just at that moment , my GSM phone rings . I say , " Hello ? " The Nortel engineer , a French guy , says , " Mr. Conteh ? " I say , " Yes ... " He says , " This is Sbastien . It 's working ! " I i " Sbastien , for God 's sake , do n't turn the phone off , stay on the line . " And I look at the minister , and I say , " I am pleased to announce today the very first digital telephone in Congo ! The telephone will never again be a luxury in this country . " Then the crowd goes pah pah pah pah . Then I gave the phone to the minister because I was so nervous , sweating blood . The minister says , " Sbastien , Sbastien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you so very much ! " And then at last the minister gave the phone to Kabila 's representative , who spoke to Sbastien .
