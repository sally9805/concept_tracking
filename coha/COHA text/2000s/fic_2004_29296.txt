1 . THE WEBSITE OF DREADFUL NIGHT Five hours ' New York jet lag and Cayce Pollard wakes in Camden Town to the dire and ever-circling wolves of disrupted circadian rhythm . It is that flat and spectral non-hour , awash in limbic tides , brainstem stirring fitfully , flashing inappropriate reptilian demands for sex , food , sedation , all of the above , and none really an option now . Not even food , as Damien 's new kitchen is as devoid of edible content as its designers ' display windows in Camden High Street . Very handsome , the upper cabinets faced in canary-yellow laminate , the lower with lacquered , unstained apple-ply . Very clean and almost entirely empty , save for a carton containing two dry pucks of Weetabix and some loose packets of herbal tea . Nothing at all in the German fridge , so new that its interior smells only of cold and long-chain monomers . She knows , now , absolutely , hearing the white noise that is London , that Damien 's theory of jet lag is correct : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reeled in on some ghostly umbilical down the vanished wake of the plane that brought her here , hundreds of thousands of feet above the Atlantic . Souls ca n't move that quickly , and are left behind , and must be awaited , upon arrival , like lost luggage . She wonders if this gets gradually worse with age : the nameless hour deeper , more null , its affect at once stranger and less interesting ? Numb here in the semi-dark , in Damien 's bedroom , beneath a silvery thing the color of oven mitts , probably never intended by its makers to actually be slept under . She 'd been too tired to find a blanket . The sheets between her skin and the weight of this industrialcoverlet are silky , some luxurious thread count , and they smell faintly of , she guesses , Damien . Not badly , though . Actually it 's not unpleasant ; any physical linkage to a fellow mammal seems a plus at this point . Damien is a friend . Their boy-girl Lego does n't click , he would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is some carefully insulated module of immaturity in him , some shy and stubborn thing that frightened the money people . Both have been very good at what they 've done , neither seeming to have the least idea of why . Google Damien and you will find a director of music videos and commercials . Google Cayce and you will find " coolhunter , " and if you look closely you may see it suggested that she is a " sensitive " of some kind , a dowser in the world of global marketing . Though the truth , Damien would say , is closer to allergy , a morbid and sometimes violent reactivity to the semiotics of the marketplace . Damien 's in Russia now , avoiding renovation and claiming to be shooting a documentary . Whatever faintly lived-in feel the place now has , Cayce knows , is the work of a production assistant . She rolls over , abandoning this pointless parody of sleep . Gropes for her clothes . A small boy 's black Fruit Of The Loom T-shirt , thoroughly shrunken , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier to New England prep schools , and a new and oversized pair of black 501 's , every trademark carefully removed . Even the buttons on these have been ground flat , featureless , by a puzzled Korean locksmith , in the Village , a week ago . The switch on Damien 's Italian floor lamp feels alien : a different click , designed to hold back a different voltage , foreign British electricity . Standing now , stepping into her jeans , she straightens , shivering . Mirror-world . The plugs on appliances are huge , triple-pronged , for a species of current that only powers electric chairs , in America . Cars are reversed , left to right , inside ; telephone handsets have a different weight , a different balance ; the covers of paperbacks look like Australian money . Pupils contracted painfully against sun-bright halogen , she squints into an actual mirror , canted against a gray wall , awaiting hanging , wherein she sees a black-legged , disjointed puppet , sleep-hair poking up like a toilet brush . She grimaces at it , thinking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to Helmut Newton 's nude portrait of Jane Birkin . In the kitchen she runs tap water through a German filter , into an Italian electric kettle . Fiddles with switches , one on the kettle , one on the plug , one on the socket . Blankly surveys the canary expanse of laminated cabinetry while it boils . Bag of some imported Californian tea substitute in a large white mug . Pouring boiling water . In the flat 's main room , she finds that Damien 's faithful Cube is on , but sleeping , the night-light glow of its static switches pulsing gently . Damien 's ambivalence toward design showing here : He wo n't allow decorators through the door unless they basically agree to not do that which they do , yet he holds on to this Mac for the way you can turn it upside down and remove its innards with a magic little aluminum handle . Like the sex of one of the robot girls in his video , now that she thinks of it . She seats herself in his high-backed workstation chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale wood of the long trestle table . The browser comes up . She types Fetish:Footage:Forum , which Damien , determined to avoid contamination , will never bookmark . The front page opens , familiar as a friend 's living room . A frame-grab from #48 serves as backdrop , dim and almost monochrome , no characters in view . This is one of the sequences that generate comparisons with Tarkovsky . She only knows Tarkovsky from stills , really , though she did once fall asleep during a screening of The Stalker , going under on an endless pan , the camera aimed straight down , in close-up , at a puddle on a ruined mosaic floor . But she is not one of those who think that much will be gained by analysis of the maker 's imagined influences . The cult of the footage is rife with subcults , claiming every possible influence . Truffaut , Peckinpah . . . The Peckinpah people , among the least likely , are still waiting for the guns to be drawn . She enters the forum itself now , automatically scanning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer threads , looking for friends , enemies , news . One thing is clear , though ; no new footage has surfaced . Nothing since that beach pan , and she does not subscribe to the theory that it is Cannes in winter . French footageheads have been unable to match it , in spite of countless hours recording pans across approximately similar scenery . She also sees that her friend Parkaboy is back in Chicago , home from an Amtrak vacation , California , but when she opens his post she sees that he 's only saying hello , literally . She clicks Respond , declares herself CayceP . Hi Parkaboy. nt When she returns to the forum page , her post is there . It is a way now , approximately , of being at home . The forum has become one of the most consistent places in her life , like a familiar caf that exists somehow outside of geography and beyond time zones . There are perhaps twenty regular posters on F:F:F , and some much larger and uncounted number of lurkers . And right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way of knowing exactly who until you are in there , and the chat room she finds not so comforting . It 's strange even with friends , like sitting in a pitch-dark cellar conversing with people at a distance of about fifteen feet . The hectic speed , and the brevity of the lines in the thread , plus the feeling that everyone is talking at once , at counter-purposes , deter her . The Cube sighs softly and makes subliminal sounds with its drive , like a vintage sports car downshifting on a distant freeway . She tries a sip of tea substitute , but it 's still too hot . A gray and indeterminate light is starting to suffuse the room in which she sits , revealing such Damieniana as has survived the recent remake . Partially disassembled robots are propped against one wall , two of them , torsos and heads , like elfin , decidedly female crash-test dummies . These are effects units from one of Damien 's videos , and she wonders , given her mood , why she finds them so comforting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Optimistic expressions of the feminine . No sci-fi kitsch for Damien . Dreamlike things in the dawn half-light , their small breasts gleaming , white plastic shining faint as old marble . Personally fetishistic , though ; she knows he 'd had them molded from a body cast of his last girlfriend , minus two . Hotmail downloads four messages , none of which she feels like opening . Her mother , three spam . The penis enlarger is still after her , twice , and Increase Your Breast Size Dramatically . Deletes spam . Sips the tea substitute . Watches the gray light becoming more like day . Eventually she goes into Damien 's newly renovated bathroom . Feels she could shower down in it prior to visiting a sterile NASA probe , or step out of some Chernobyl scenario to have her lead suit removed by rubber-gowned Soviet technicians , who 'd then scrub her with long-handled brushes . The fixtures in the shower can be adjusted with elbows , preserving the sterility of scrubbed hands . She pulls off her sweater and T-shirt and , using hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FOUR hours later she 's on a reformer in a Pilates studio in an upscale alley called Neal 's Yard , the car and driver from Blue Ant waiting out on whatever street it is . The reformer is a very long , very low , vaguely ominous and Weimar-looking piece of spring-loaded furniture . On which she now reclines , doing v-position against the foot rail at the end . The padded platform she rests on wheels back and forth along tracks of angle-iron within the frame , springs twanging softly . Ten of these , ten toes , ten from the heels . . . In New York she does this at a fitness center frequented by dance professionals , but here in Neal 's Yard , this morning , she seems to be the sole client . The place is only recently opened , apparently , and perhaps this sort of thing is not yet so popular here . There is that mirror-world ingestion of archaic substances , she thinks : People smoke , and drink as though it were good for you , and seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heroin , she 's read , is cheaper here than it 's ever been , the market still glutted by the initial dumping of Afghani opium supplies . Done with her toes , she changes to heels , craning her neck to be certain her feet are correctly aligned . She likes Pilates because it is n't , in the way she thinks of yoga , meditative . You have to keep your eyes open , here , and pay attention . That concentration counters the anxiety she feels now , the pre-job jitters she has n't experienced in a while . She 's here on Blue Ant 's ticket . Relatively tiny in terms of permanent staff , globally distributed , more post-geographic than multinational , the agency has from the beginning billed itself as a high-speed , low-drag life-form in an advertising ecology of lumbering herbivores . Or perhaps as some non-carbon-based life-form , entirely sprung from the smooth and ironic brow of its founder , Hubertus Bigend , a nominal Belgian who looks like Tom Cruise on a diet of virgins ' blood and truffled chocolates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have no sense at all that his name might seem ridiculous to anyone , ever . Otherwise , she would find him even more unbearable than she already does . It 's entirely personal , though at one remove . Still doing heels , she checks her watch , a Korean clone of an old-school Casio G-Shock , its plastic case sanded free of logos with a scrap of Japanese micro-abrasive . She is due in Blue Ant 's Soho offices in fifty minutes . She drapes a pair of limp green foam pads over the foot rail , carefully positions her feet , lifts them on invisible stiletto heels , and begins her ten prehensile. 2 . BITCH CPUs for the meeting , reflected in the window of a Soho specialist in mod paraphernalia , are a fresh Fruit T-shirt , her black Buzz Rickson 's MA-1 , anonymous black skirt from a Tulsa thrift , the black leggings she 'd worn for Pilates , black Harajuku schoolgirl shoes . Her purse-analog is an envelope of black East German laminate , purchased on eBay-if not actual Stasi-issue then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , pale in the glass , and beyond them Ben Sherman shirts and fishtail parkas , cufflinks in the form of the RAF roundel that marked the wings of Spitfires . CPUs . Cayce Pollard Units . That 's what Damien calls the clothing she wears . CPUs are either black , white , or gray , and ideally seem to have come into this world without human intervention . What people take for relentless minimalism is a side effect of too much exposure to the reactor-cores of fashion . This has resulted in a remorseless paring-down of what she can and will wear . She is , literally , allergic to fashion . She can only tolerate things that could have been worn , to a general lack of comment , during any year between 1945 and 2000 . She 's a design-free zone , a one-woman school of anti whose very austerity periodically threatens to spawn its own cult . Around her the bustle of Soho , a Friday morning building toward boozy lunches and careful chatter in all these restaurants . To one of which , Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligatory post-meeting meal . But she feels herself tipping back down into a miles-long trough of jet lag , and knows that that is what she must surf now : her lack of serotonin , the delayed arrival of her soul . She checks her watch and heads down the street , toward Blue Ant , whose premises until recently were those of an older , more linear sort of agency . The sky is a bright gray bowl , crossed with raveled contrails , and as she presses the button to announce herself at Blue Ant , she wishes she 'd brought her sunglasses . SEATED now , opposite Bernard Stonestreet , familiar from Blue Ant 's New York operation , she finds him pale and freckled as ever , with carroty hair upswept in a weird Aubrey Beardsley flame motif that might be the result of his having slept on it that way , but is more likely the work of some exclusive barber . He is wearing what Cayce takes to be a Paul Smith suit , more specifically the 118 jacket and the 11T trouser , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be about wearing many thousand pounds ' worth of garments that appear to have never been worn before having been slept in , the night before . In New York he prefers to look as though he 's just been detailed by a tight scrum of specialists . Different cultural parameters . On his left sits Dorotea Benedetti , her hair scraped back from her forehead with a haute nerd intensity that Cayce suspects means business and trouble both . Dorotea , whom Cayce knows glancingly from previous and minor business in New York , is something fairly high up in the graphics design partnership of Heinzi &; Pfaff . She has flown in , this morning , from Frankfurt , to present H &P's; initial shot at a new logo for one of the world 's two largest manufacturers of athletic footwear . Bigend has defined a need for this maker to re-identify , in some profound but so far unspecified way . Sales of athletic shoes , " trainers " in the mirror-world , are tanking bigtime , and the skate shoes that had already started to push them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been tracking the street-level emergence of what she thinks of as " urban survival " footwear , and though this is so far at the level of consumer re-purposing , she has no doubt that commodification will soon follow identification . The new logo will be this firm 's pivot into the new century , and Cayce , with her marketable allergy , has been brought over to do in person the thing that she does best . That seems odd to her , or if not odd , archaic . Why not teleconference ? There may be so much at stake , she supposes , that security is an issue , but it 's been a while now since business has required her to leave New York . Whatever , Dorotea 's looking serious about it . Serious as cancer . On the table in front of her , perhaps a millimeter too carefully aligned , is an elegant gray cardboard envelope , fifteen inches on a side , bearing the austere yet whimsical logo of Heinzi &; Pfaff . It is closed with one of those expensively archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown cardboard buttons . Cayce looks away from Dorotea and the envelope , noting that a great many Nineties pounds had once been lavished on this third-floor meeting room , with its convexly curving walls of wood suggesting the first-class lounge of a transatlantic zeppelin . She notices threaded anchors exposed on the pale veneer of the convex wall , where once had been displayed the logo of whichever agency previously occupied the place , and early warning signs of Blue Ant renovation are visible as well : scaffolding erected in a hallway , where someone has been examining ductwork , and rolls of new carpeting stacked like plastic-wrapped logs from a polyester forest . Dorotea may have attempted to out-minimalize her this morning , Cayce decides . If so , it has n't worked . Dorotea 's black dress , for all its apparent simplicity , is still trying to say several things at once , probably in at least three languages . Cayce has hung her Buzz Rickson 's over the back of her chair , and now she catches Dorotea looking at it . The Rickson 's is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as purely functional and iconic a garment as the previous century produced . Dorotea 's slow burn is being accelerated , Cayce suspects , by her perception that Cayce 's MA-1 trumps any attempt at minimalism , the Rickson 's having been created by Japanese obsessives driven by passions having nothing at all to do with anything remotely like fashion . Cayce knows , for instance , that the characteristically wrinkled seams down either arm were originally the result of sewing with pre-war industrial machines that rebelled against the slippery new material , nylon . The makers of the Rickson 's have exaggerated this , but only very slightly , and done a hundred other things , tiny things , as well , so that their product has become , in some very Japanese way , the result of an act of worship . It is an imitation more real somehow than that which it emulates . It is easily the most expensive garment Cayce owns , and would be virtually impossible to replace . " You do n't mind ? " Stonestreet producing a pack of cigarettes called Silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as somehow being the British equivalent of the Japanese Mild Seven . Two default brands of creatives . " No , " says Cayce . " Please do . " There is actually an ashtray on the table , a small one , round and perfectly white . As archaic a fixture in America , in the context of a business meeting , as would be one of those flat and filigreed absinthe trowels . ( But in London , she knew , you might encounter those as well , though she 'd not yet seen one at a meeting . ) " Dorotea ? " Offering the pack , but not to Cayce . Dorotea declining . Stonestreet puts a filter tip between his tidily mobile lips and takes out a box of matches that Cayce assumes were acquired in some restaurant the night before . The matchbox looks very nearly as expensive as Dorotea 's gray envelope . He lights up . " Sorry we had to haul you over for this , Cayce , " he says . The spent match makes a tiny ceramic sound when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I do , Bernard , " Cayce says . " You look tired , " says Dorotea . " Four hours difference . " Smiling with only the corners of her mouth . " Have you tried those pills from New Zealand ? " Stonestreet asks . Cayce remembers that his American wife , once the ingnue in a short-lived X-Files clone , is the creator of an apparently successful line of vaguely homeopathic beauty products . " Jacques Cousteau said that jet lag was his favorite drug . " " Well ? " Dorotea looks pointedly at the H &P; envelope . Stonestreet blows a stream of smoke . " Well yes , I suppose we should . " They both look at Cayce . Cayce looks Dorotea in the eye . " Ready when you are . " Dorotea unwinds the cord from beneath the cardboard button nearest Cayce . Lifts the flap . Reaches in with thumb and forefinger . There is a silence . " Well then , " Stonestreet says , and stubs out his Silk Cut . Dorotea removes an eleven-inch square of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners , between the tips of perfectly manicured forefingers , she displays it to Cayce . There is a drawing there , a sort of scribble in thick black Japanese brush , a medium she knows to be the in-house hallmark of Herr Heinzi himself . To Cayce , it most resembles a syncopated sperm , as rendered by the American underground cartoonist Rick Griffin , circa 1967 . She knows immediately that it does not , by the opaque standards of her inner radar , work . She has no way of knowing how she knows . Briefly , though , she imagines the countless Asian workers who might , should she say yes , spend years of their lives applying versions of this symbol to an endless and unyielding flood of footwear . What would it mean to them , this bouncing sperm ? Would it work its way into their dreams , eventually ? Would their children chalk it in doorways before they knew its meaning as a trademark ? " No , " she says . Stonestreet sighs . Not a deep sigh . Dorotea returns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Cayce 's contract for a consultation of this sort specifies that she absolutely not be asked to critique anything , or provide creative input of any sort . She is only there to serve as a very specialized piece of human litmus paper . Dorotea takes one of Stonestreet 's cigarettes and lights it , dropping the wooden match on the table beside the ashtray . " How was the winter , then , in New York ? " " Cold , " Cayce says . " And sad ? It is still sad ? " Cayce says nothing . " You are available to stay here , " Dorotea asks , " while we go back to the drawing board ? " Cayce wonders if Dorotea knows the clich . " I 'm here for two weeks , " she says . " Flat-sitting for a friend . " " A vacation , then . " " Not if I 'm working on this . " Dorotea says nothing . " It must be difficult , " Stonestreet says , between steepled , freckled fingers , his red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " when you do n't like something . Emotionally , I mean . " Cayce watches Dorotea rise and , carrying her Silk Cut , cross to a sideboard , where she pours Perrier into a tumbler . " It is n't about liking anything , Bernard , " Cayce says , turning back to Stonestreet , " it 's like that roll of carpet , there ; it 's either blue or it 's not . Whether or not it 's blue is n't something I have an emotional investment in . " She feels bad energy brush past her as Dorotea returns to her seat . Dorotea puts her water down beside the H &P; envelope and does a rather inexpert job of stubbing out her cigarette . " I will speak with Heinzi this afternoon . I would call him now but I know that he is in Stockholm , meeting with Volvo . " The air seems very thick with smoke now and Cayce feels like coughing . " There 's no rush , Dorotea , " Stonestreet says , and Cayce hopes that this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surf is full , the food California-inflected Vietnamese fusion with more than the usual leavening of colonial Frenchness . The white walls are decorated with enormous prints of close-up black-and-white photographs of ' Nam-era Zippo lighters , engraved with crudely drawn American military symbols , still cruder sexual motifs , and stenciled slogans . These remind Cayce of photographs of tombstones in Confederate graveyards , except for the graphic content and the nature of the slogans , and the ' Nam theme suggests to her that the place has been here for a while . IF I HAD A FARM IN HELL AND A HOUSE IN VIETNAM I 'D SELL THEM BOTH The lighters in the photographs are so worn , so dented and sweat-corroded , that Cayce may well be the first diner to ever have deciphered these actual texts . BURY ME FACE DOWN SO THE WORLD CAN KISS MY ASS " His surname actually is ' Heinzi , ' you know , " Stonestreet is saying , pouring a second glass of the Californian cabernet that Cayce , though she knows better , is drinking . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , have long since gone south . " " Ibiza , " Cayce suggests . " Er ? " " Sorry , Bernard , I 'm tired . " " Those pills . From New Zealand . " THERE IS NO GRAVITY THE WORLD SUCKS " I 'll be fine . " A sip of wine . " She 's a piece of work , is n't she ? " " Dorotea ? " Stonestreet rolls his eyes , which are a peculiar brown , inflected as with Mercurochrome ; something iridescent , greenly copper-tinged. 173 AIRBORNE She asks after the American wife . Stonestreet dutifully recounts the launch of a cucumber-based mask , the thin end of a fresh wedge of product , touching on the politics involved in retail placement . Lunch arrives . Cayce concentrates on tiny fried spring rolls , setting herself for auto-nod and periodically but sympathetically raised eyebrows , grateful that he 's carrying the conversational ball . She 's way down deep in that trough now , with the half-glass of cabernet starting to exert its own lateral influence , and she knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some food in her stomach , and be gone . But the Zippo tombstones , with their existential elegies , tug at her . PHU CAT Restaurant art that diners actually notice is a dubious idea , particularly to one with Cayce 's peculiar , visceral , but still somewhat undefined sensitivities . " So when it looked as though Harvey Knickers were n't going to come aboard . . . " Nod , raise eyebrows , chew spring roll . This is working . She covers her glass when he starts to pour her more wine . And so she makes it easily enough through lunch with Bernard Stonestreet , blipped occasionally by these emblematic place-names from the Zippo graveyard ( CU CHI , QUI NHON ) lining the walls , and at last he has paid and they are standing up to leave . Reaching for her Rickson 's , where she 'd hung it on the back of her chair , she sees a round , freshly made hole , left shoulder , rear , the size of the lit tip of a cigarette . Its edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through this is visible a gray interlining , no doubt to some particular Cold War mil-spec pored over by the jacket 's otaku makers . " Is something wrong ? " " No , " Cayce says , " nothing . " Putting on her ruined Rickson 's . Near the door , on their way out , she numbly registers a shallow Lucite cabinet displaying an array of those actual Vietnam Zippos , perhaps a dozen of them , and automatically leans closer . SHIT ON MY DICK OR BLOOD ON MY BLADE Which is very much her attitude toward Dorotea , right now , though she doubts she 'll be able to do anything about it , and will only turn the anger against herself .
