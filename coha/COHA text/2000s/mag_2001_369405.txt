There was n't a lot of tension at Spencer Abraham 's confirmation hearing last week . George W. Bush 's pick to head the Energy Department is a shoo-in . But one uncomfortable moment came when Abraham refused to say what the new Administration would do about California 's electricity crisis . That prompted Frank Murkowski , chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee , to growl , " You better have some answers . " <P> What will Bush do to keep the lights on ? He does n't have a lot of options . Last week he ruled out new federal controls on wholesale electricity prices , which Governor Gray Davis had proposed as a way out of the mess . Bush also nixed the idea of bailing out the state 's nearly bankrupt utilities . The Los Angeles Times compared his position with President Gerald Ford 's 1975 refusal to rescue New York City from fiscal default , " a decision memorialized , " the Times noted dryly , " by the tabloid headline : FORD TO CITY : DROP DEAD . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't step in . Instead , the White House apparently plans to take aim at federal environmental regulations that , Bush argues , limit power supplies by keeping plants from running at capacity . But taking on the green lobby could use up valuable capital at a time when Bush wants to press his domestic agenda . And his big problem is more basic : his energy policy is mostly just an oil-and-gas policy . He wants to use tax credits to boost domestic oil production , and he has a 10-year , $7.1 billion plan that includes drilling for petroleum on 1.5 million acres of protected Alaskan tundra in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . But those ideas  --  the second one hugely controversial  --  would take years to have an effect , and even then would n't ease the electricity crunch . Bush 's goal of eliminating regulations that impede the construction of refineries , pipelines , plants and transmission lines would help someday , but it wo n't be any easier to get through Congress than his scheme to drill in the Arctic . <P> Bush 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of figuring out what to do about California . One stopgap : renew the Clinton Administration 's order that power and gas companies across the country transfer their excess capacity to the Golden State . But diplomacy may be the most effective arrow in Bush 's quiver . He plans to place energy on the national-security agenda and lobby OPEC to pump more oil . Although the cartel last week announced production cuts , which pushed prices higher , some key members , such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , remain grateful to Bush 's father for winning the Gulf War . Will they help the son ? <P> For consumers , Bush 's laissez-faire approach is likely to be painful . The new President backs hundreds of millions of dollars in extra funding for an energy-assistance program to ease the burden on the poorest Americans . For everyone else , high prices could be around for a while . The clearest indication of that came from Kenneth Lay , the chairman of Enron , the Houston-based energy giant that is the nation 's largest power marketer , with a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to resolve a " pretty much self-inflicted problem "  --  even if that means price increases for consumers .
