It is well that war is so terrible , or we should grow too fond of it . // - Robert E. Lee , at Fredericksburg // Shut up , Bobby Lee . It 's no real pleasure in life . // - The Misfit , in Flannery O'Connor 's " A Good Man Is Hard to Find " // In his dashing ( if sometimes depressive ) antebellum prime , he may have been the most beautiful person in America , a sort of precursor-cross between England 's Cary Grant and Virginia 's Randolph Scott . He was in his element gossiping with belles about their beaux at balls . In theaters of grinding , hellish human carnage he kept a pet hen for company . He had tiny feet that he loved his children to tickle . None of these things seems to fit , for if ever there was a grave American icon , it is Robert Edward Lee-hero of the Confederacy in the American Civil War , a unifying national figure for a century or so thereafter , and currently a symbol of nobility to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in 1870 , Frederick Douglass , the former fugitive slave who had become the nation 's most prominent African American , wrote , " We can scarcely take up a newspaper ... that is not filled with nauseating flatteries " of Lee , from which " it would seem ... that the soldier who kills the most men in battle , even in a bad cause , is the greatest Christian , and entitled to the highest place in heaven . " Two years later one of Lee 's ex-generals , Jubal A. Early , apotheosized his late commander as follows : " Our beloved Chief stands , like some lofty column which rears its head among the highest , in grandeur , simple , pure and sublime . " // In 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt expressed mainstream American sentiment in a letter to the Committee of Arrangement for the Celebration of the Hundredth Anniversary of Lee 's birth : General Lee has left us the memory , not merely of his extraordinary skill as a General , his dauntless courage and high leadership ... but also of that serene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obligations of civic duty .... He stood that hardest of all strains , the strain of bearing himself well through the gray evening of failure ; and therefore out of what seemed failure he helped to build the wonderful and mighty triumph of our national life , in which all his countrymen , north and south , share . // Teddy Roosevelt , Gen. Douglas MacArthur , and President Harry S. Truman had at least three things in common with Lee : They were all brave soldiers , staunch leaders of men , and , in no pejorative sense , mama 's boys . Both Truman and MacArthur were adjured by their strong-minded mothers to grow up just like Robert E. Lee , and they never stopped taking that charge to heart . // When a white mob tried to prevent the integration of public schools in Little Rock , Arkansas , in 1957 , Robert Penn Warren wrote , " Can the man howling in the mob imagine General R. E. Lee , CSA , shaking hands with Orval Faubus , governor of Arkansas ? " Certainly not-Lee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , a portrait of Lee on the James River floodwall in Richmond , Virginia , was defaced , restored , denounced by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , and defended by white supremacist David Duke . U.S. Attorney General-designate John Ashcroft was widely disparaged for having called Lee a " patriot . " " We 've got to stand up and speak in this respect , " Ashcroft had written , " or else we 'll be taught that Lee and other Confederate leaders were giving their lives , subscribing their sacred fortunes and their honor to some perverted agenda . " // One thing that can be said for Lee is that he would have welcomed none of these pronouncements . If the self-effacing patrician could have known that his face would live on for so long as a quasi-religious , recurrently divisive symbol , it might have made him moan , as he did after sending thousands of men to be cut to ribbons at Gettysburg , " Too bad ! Too bad ! OH ! TOO BAD ! " He was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his sense of honor was rooted in genuine-if in fact far from simple or serene-humility . The most sublime word , Lee said , was " duty . " In 1860 he wrote to Robert E. Lee Jr. , who was starting college : // You must be frank in the world , frankness is the child of honesty and courage . Say just what you mean to do on every occasion , and take it for granted you mean to do right .... Never do anything wrong to make a friend or keep one ; the man who requires you to do so , is dearly purchased at a sacrifice . Deal kindly , but firmly with all your classmates ; you will find it the policy which wears best . Above all do not appear to others what you are not . // Did he speak in such tones to himself ? He was the last avatar , wrote Edmund Wilson approvingly , of " classical antique virtue , at once aristocratic and republican . " But he was also a man . And is n't it true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Lee Prewitt in From Here to Eternity , " Ai n't nothin the matter with a soldier that ai n't the matter with everybody else " ? // We may think we know Lee because we have a mental image : gray . Not only the uniform , the mythic horse , the hair and beard , but the resignation with which he accepted dreary burdens that offered " neither pleasure nor advantage " : in particular , the Confederacy , a cause of which he took a dim view until he went to war for it . He did not see right and wrong in tones of gray , and yet his moralizing could generate a fog , as in a letter from the front to his invalid wife : " You must endeavour to enjoy the pleasure of doing good . That is all that makes life valuable . " All right . But then he adds : " When I measure my own by that standard I am filled with confusion and despair . " // His own hand probably never drew human blood nor fired a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a faint scratch on the cheek from a sharpshooter 's bullet , but many thousands of men died quite horribly in battles where he was the dominant-fiery-spirit , and most of the casualties were on the other side . If we take as a given Lee 's granitic conviction that everything is God 's will , however , he was born to lose . // He was usually kinder than most great men . But in even the most sympathetic versions of his life story he comes across as a bit of a stick-certainly compared with his scruffy nemesis , Ulysses S. Grant ; his zany , ferocious " right arm , " Stonewall Jackson ; and the dashing " eyes " of his army , Jeb Stuart . For these men , the Civil War was just the ticket . Lee , however , has come down in history as too fine for the bloodbath of 1861-65 . As an icon he has enabled Americans of the South and also of the North to feel that somehow the American family was too decent to have brought upon itself four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror of the war we have the image of Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves , and we have the image of Robert E. Lee nobly putting down his sword and standing selflessly for reconciliation . Both of those images have undergone reassessment-for many contemporary Americans , Lee is at best the moral equivalent of Hitler 's brilliant field marshal Erwin Rommel ( who , however , turned against Hitler , as Lee never did against Jefferson Davis , who , to be sure , was no Hitler ) - but they have n't gone away . // Can we recast Lee in terms more edifying in this century ? // One problem is that Lee 's life did n't fit him . He appears to have been too fine for his childhood , for his education , for his profession , for his marriage , and for the Confederacy . Not according to him . According to him , he was not fine enough . For all his audacity on the battlefield , he accepted rather passively one raw deal after another , bending over backward for everyone from Jefferson Davis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know him ? The works of a general are battles , campaigns , and usually memoirs . The engagements of the Civil War shape up more as bloody muddles than as commanders ' chess games . For a long time during the war " Old Bobbie Lee , " as he was referred to worshipfully by his troops and nervously by the foe , had the greatly superior Union forces spooked , but a century and a third of analysis and counteranalysis has resulted in no core consensus as to the genius or the folly of his generalship . And he wrote no memoir . He wrote personal letters-a discordant mix of flirtation , joshing , lyrical touches , and stern religious adjuration-and he wrote official dispatches that are so impersonal and ( generally ) unself-serving as to seem above the fray . He also wrote one strange parable , which had come to him in a dream . // Grant finally wore down Lee 's ingenious military defenses , but he did n't crack his facade : There at the end stood Lee at Appomattox , too fine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee as a touchstone , Robert Penn Warren- who had written a biography of John Brown and a novel whose central character was inspired by Huey Long-grumbled , " Who cares about Robert E. Lee ? Now , there 's a man who 's smooth as an egg . Turn him around , this primordial perfection : you see , he has no story . You ca n't just say what a wonderful man he was , and that you know he had some chaotic something inside because he 's human but you ca n't get at it . " // Maybe in this century , after monumentalism has given way to chaos theory and obsession with the self , we can at last figure out how to care humanly about the self that Robert E. Lee was at such pains to deny . The only way to get inside him , perhaps , is by edging fractally around the record of his life to find spots where he comes through ; by holding up next to him some of the fully realized characters-Grant , Jackson , Stuart , his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interacted ; and by subjecting to contemporary skepticism certain concepts-honor , " gradual emancipation , " divine will-upon which he unreflectively founded his identity . // Then there are minor but provocative matters like his feet , a peculiar instance of misspelling , his pet hen , his enigmatic " Pussyism " joke . For all that he tends to bring out a certain solemnity , even in discussions of his humor , he was capable of larky jocularity in the oddest connections and the darkest of times . If in considering his sad life we strive for too consistent a tone , we miss some of its jangly resonance . As he would say to his children when he was at his most intimate with them , " No tickling , no story . " // He was n't always gray . Until war aged him dramatically his sharp dark brown eyes were complemented by black hair ( " ebon and abundant , " as his doting biographer Douglas Southall Freeman puts it , " with a wave that a woman might have envied " ) , a robust black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any beard , and dark mercurial brows . He was not one to hide his looks under a bushel . His heart , on the other hand ... " The heart , he kept locked away , " as Stephen Vincent Ben ? t proclaimed in John Brown 's Body , " from all the picklocks of biographers . " Accounts by people who knew him give the impression that no one knew his whole heart , even before it was broken by the war . Perhaps it broke many years before the war . " You know she is like her papa , always wanting something , " he wrote about one of his daughters . The great Southern diarist of his day , Mary Chesnut , tells us that when a lady teased him about his ambitions , " he remonstrated-said his tastes were of the simplest . He only wanted a Virginia farm-no end of cream and fresh butter-and fried chicken . Not one fried chicken or two-but unlimited fried chicken . " Just before Lee 's surrender at Appomattox , one of his nephews found him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying around a fried chicken leg wrapped in a piece of bread , which a Virginia countrywoman had pressed upon him but for which he could n't muster any hunger . // In 1960 Robert Penn Warren was trying , unsuccessfully , to write an essay about Lee 's decision to side with the Confederacy . " I do hope you can manage it , " Warren 's friend Cleanth Brooks wrote to him . Brooks was a fellow Southerner and a prime mover along with Warren in the so-called New Criticism , which concentrated on literature 's intrinsic texture rather than its political and biographical ramifications , and he seemed to want Lee 's texture to be enough . " You are right : that should n't fall into the wrong hands , " Brooks went on . " I do n't want to see a Lee throwing in his lot with the Confederacy because of an Oedipus complex , for instance . " Well , why not ? What is so fine about Lee that he is exempt from whatever sifter a given age may employ to sort out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not for psychologizing . Item : A recent study found boys brought up in " mother-only households " to be disproportionately at risk for major depressive disorders . ( See Appendix I. ) // A boy who grows up with no father but one who is absent and discredited may lack certain tones of voice , may develop alternative modes of authority . Of the precious few memories Robert E. Lee can have had of his prodigal father coming home , the most vivid , we may assume , was of a broken , grotesquely swollen figure hobbling up the front walk , head swathed in bandages . A mob of patriots , as they saw themselves , had beaten Henry " Light-Horse Harry " Lee , hero of the Revolution , very nearly to death . They had jabbed him with pocketknives and dripped candle wax into his eyes in attempts to make sure he was dead . They had slashed his face wide open in trying to cut off his nose . He had been defending a newspaper 's right to oppose a war . // It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's side , Lee 's family was among Virginia 's and therefore the nation 's most distinguished . Four of his father 's cousins had been prominent members of the Continental Congress-so prominent , indeed , that other first families expressed resentment that the Lees were hogging the Revolution . // Henry , the scion who was to become Light-Horse Harry , was born in 1756 . As a young a man he was always cheerful , ever gallant toward the ladies , a hell of a fellow among the fellows , given to flights of wild and biting humor , fiercely opinionated , and able to quote Alexander Pope at length from memory . He graduated from Princeton at nineteen , joined the Continental Army at twenty as a captain of dragoons , and impressed Gen. Charles Lee , no very direct relation , as having " come out of his mother 's womb a soldier . " // Though physically rather slight and facially rather plump , Harry looked fine on a horse and rode like the cavalier he was by birth . As he rose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Lee 's legion of cavalry and infantry , he held the intense loyalty of his troops by combining strict discipline , bold stratagems , constant readiness to ride , and prudent preparation , including attention to hygiene : " I never saw one of his men in the general hospital , " said an army surgeon . Every one of his cavalrymen eventually carried a sword taken personally from an enemy . //
