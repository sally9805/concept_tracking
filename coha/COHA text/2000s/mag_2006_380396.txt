Q &A; JOHN WATERS <P> From his home in Baltimore , Md. , filmmaker John Waters curates and is host of a collection of Movies That Will Corrupt You , starting Feb. 3 on here ! Networks . <P> What do these films have in common ? They 're little seen . They 're intelligent but extreme . <P> Explain your first selection , the 1996 black comedy Freeway . We 're so used to seeing Reese Witherspoon . But you 've never seen her be a mean redneck . In this movie , she 's poor and angry and very funny . I think it 's one of her best performances . <P> What 's your idea of a good date movie ? Sometimes a date movie can be a litmus test : If you can get through this , then we should be in love . Freeway would be a good date movie for me . If they were too uptight to like it , it would n't work out . <P> Your intros to the films feel very Vincent Price . Well , I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been trying to hijack his career forever . <P> What 's the difference between good bad taste and bad bad taste ? Good bad taste is not condescending . Anything I ever make fun of , I love . Bad taste is a freedom I do n't have . I worry what other people think . The creative use of bad taste is almost over with . What 's trashy now ? <P> What about reality TV ? I 've never seen it . I 'm radically against it . Reality TV is for people who lead boring lives . I 'm never bored . <P> Is Brokeback Mountain a cultural watershed ? The only thing I 've ever agreed with the right wing on is that this is a great recruitment film . I know a lot of gay people who dress as cowboys , and none of them are that cute . <P> I 'LL HAVE WHAT SHE 'S HAVING Angelina Jolie has two . So does Nicole Kidman . And now MEG RYAN just got one of her own . No , we 're not talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest celeb to adopt a child , a Chinese girl ( she already has a son , Jack , 13 , with ex- husband , actor Dennis Quaid ) . After the tepid response to her 2004 boxing film , Against the Ropes , sent the star to her corner for two years , Ryan is re-entering the fight with a new movie , In the Land of Women , due in May . Nothing like a new baby to ease that treacherous journey from ingenue to auntie roles . <P> WHAT WOULD ALICE THINK ? Though daring for its time  --  Mom and Dad sleep in the same bed !  --  The Brady Bunch omitted certain realities of life in 1970s America . This spring BARRY WILLIAMS , who played eldest sibling Greg , and CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT , middle kid Peter , will make up for at least one omission by guest starring as a gay couple on polyester 's current TV home , Fox 's That ' 70s Show . " This is a clever , hip , edgy look at that time period , " says Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new neighbor , Wisconsinite Kitty Forman , played by DEBRA JO RUPP , when they share an onscreen kiss . Maybe next Marcia and Jan can get Kitty and the girls to go campaign for Jimmy Carter .
