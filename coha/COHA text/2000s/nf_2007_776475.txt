The Towpath // It was like something out of a spy movie . // The date was March 16 , 1997 , a Sunday . I was at home , on a rare day off , when the phone rang . " Meet me by the C&amp;O Canal , near the Old Angler 's Inn in an hour , " a voice said , almost in a whisper . " Come alone . " That was all . He did n't have to identify himself ; he knew I would be there . // The voice belonged to Anthony Lake , who had stepped down as national security advisor two months earlier , when Bill Clinton nominated him to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency . Back in 1992 , at the start of the Clinton administration , Tony had made me part of his National Security Council staff . Prior to that I had served as a Senate staffer , and for the previous four years had been staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence . Over the course of three years on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional relationship with Lake and his deputy , Sandy Berger . Then , in May 1995 , John Deutch , who was about to become CIA director , tapped me to be his second in command . We had gotten to know each other when Deutch was deputy secretary of defense and had even traveled together once overseas to deal with a sensitive intelligence matter . But now , after only a year and a half in the job , Deutch was leaving CIA , and my friend and former boss Tony Lake had been picked to replace him . // Tony had all the right tools for the job : intelligence , acumen , the confidence of the president , and strength of character . Outsiders who observed Tony when he was national security advisor assumed from his quiet comportment that he was some misplaced mild-mannered professor . Not so . Amid many large egos , Tony was the unchallenged boss at the NSC , a master at process and bureaucratic intrigue . He had observed up close the dysfunctional backbiting that crippled the Carter administration and had worked hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarity in Washington , Tony had no desire to have a high profile , and he emphasized to his staff that we would succeed or fail together as a team . None of us , he stressed , had been elected to the offices we held . // All those attributes made Tony an ideal choice , I thought , to lead CIA . Selfishly , I also knew that his arrival at Langley meant that I would be able to stay on in the deputy 's job-a position I was learning to love . // John Deutch-a brilliant , eccentric , and largely misunderstood figure-had an ability to translate his technical expertise into policy in a way few people could . A gregarious bear of a man , he wanted to be respected by the Agency 's workforce . But shortly after he arrived at CIA , the Agency 's inspector general issued a report criticizing the professionalism of some CIA officers in Guatemala in the 1980s , and John disciplined some of those named . That got him off to a rough start with the workforce . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a reporter for the New York Times Magazine that he did not find many first-class intellects at the Agency . " Compared to uniformed officers , " the Times quoted John as saying , " they certainly are not as competent , or as understanding of what their relative role is and what their responsibilities are . " The Central Intelligence Agency is a very emotional place , and after that , John 's chances of winning hearts and minds there were pretty much shot . I know he regretted his remarks . It was a valuable lesson that I would put to use later : You have to earn your employees ' trust , keep your own counsel , be optimistic , and , as I always said , lead from " the perspective of the glass being always half-full. " // John 's tumultuous tenure at CIA ended in December 1996 when he abruptly resigned . The conventional wisdom around Washington was that he really wanted to be secretary of defense and that when it became clear that post was not to be his , he left government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned out his desk , I became acting director . // I thought I would have to handle the two jobs for only a short while until Lake was confirmed . But four months later , the nomination was still tied up in the Senate . I figured that the delay in Tony 's confirmation was behind his request to meet with me , but I had no idea why he had insisted on such an unusual location . His instructions to come alone were especially puzzling . He knew that deputy CIA directors do n't go anywhere alone . Since I 'd taken the job at the Agency , a heavily armed security detail had been my constant companion . Everywhere I went , I was driven around in a big , black armored SUV with a second follow car full of guys with guns . Threats against senior CIA officials by terrorists and nutcases were very real . In the four months since I had become acting DCI , the security had been ratcheted up even tighter . // Nonetheless , I tried to comply with Tony 's request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security detail , Dan O'Connor , and told him that he and I needed to go for a little ride-alone . Dan , known around the Agency as " Doc , " for his initials , is a big , genial New York Irishman . He would take a bullet to save my life without hesitation , but he hated the notion of our venturing out without the usual retinue of backups . His duty was to minimize the risk to me , not maximize it . Nonetheless , he drove over to my home , and the two of us headed south toward the Potomac River . // We pulled into the gravel parking lot across from the Old Angler 's Inn . From there , with Doc keeping a discreet distance , I set off down a dirt path to the century-and-a-half-old canal that once carried ... //
