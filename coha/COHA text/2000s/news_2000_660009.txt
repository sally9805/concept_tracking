<p> The last time Jose Ramos had seen the hills and coasts of Vietnam , he was a shaken 20-year-old - a frontline medic in the 101st Army Airborne Infantry Division who had spent the last year amid the undergrowth and gunfire of the Southeast Asian jungle . Almost 30 years later , as his Vietnamese Airlines jet touched down on the tarmac in Hanoi on a gray December day in 1997 , the images he had feared for the better part of his life suddenly came back . On the runway , he saw the Communist red star painted on every plane . In the terminal , customs officers wore the uniforms the enemy had worn during the war . " I was really scared . I cried uncontrollably and immediately wanted to go home , " he says . Two days later , the mending began . Mr. Ramos was in Vietnam to participate in a 16-day bicycle trip set up for both former US soldiers and Vietcong fighters . The group left from the Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi - the building that America bombed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning the sidewalks with witch-like brooms . Then , as they negotiated Hanoi 's tangle of mopeds and pedicabs , a former North Vietnamese soldier reached over and grabbed Mr. Ramos 's hand . He held it above his head and did n't let go . For two miles . " He told me , ' We do n't hold grudges . We closed the book on the war in 1975 and started to write a new one ' " Ramos recalls . ' " You Americans should allow yourselves to do that , too . ' " Like hundreds of other Vietnam veterans , Ramos has found that returning to the country in which he served - and many of his friends fell - has helped the healing process . Ramos found a measure of peace in his 1,200-mile bicycle trip from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City . Others have found it simply in coming back to help the people of the country they once fought . These veterans are in the minority - many either have no desire to return or want nothing to do with the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam , their stories provide a lens for looking at the combatants and the country - and how both have been transformed over time . " The overwhelming majority of Vietnam veterans have shut out their experience in the war so completely that they want nothing to do with returning there , " says Leo Powers of the Veteran 's Vietnam Restoration Project , which helps rebuild schools and hospitals in Vietnam . " This is a great tragedy because 99.9 percent of those who do come back say it was the best thing they ever did in their lives . " Of 3 million soldiers who saw duty , about 2.5 million are still alive . Nearly 60,000 were killed or never returned and more than 2,000 MIAs remain . But as many as 100,000 have died premature deaths related to injuries , medical problems , drug abuse , alcoholism , and suicide . According to veterans ' organizations , soldiers in Vietnam , in contrast to those of other wars , typically served at a younger age , trained separately from those they served with , returned from combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less time to reorient . They also returned to a society divided over the purpose of the war , and the role and actions of the military . For Ramos , the whole experience of Vietnam has been about wrenching transitions . After living among chaos and death every day for 12 months as a medic , he recalls being shipped back to a base in Oakland , Calif. , in 1968 . The country was torn apart . Martin Luther King Jr . had been assassinated , and the two most prevalent things on college campuses were Jimmy Hendrix albums and tear gas . Protesters screamed epithets and hurled objects at returning vets - including Ramos . He remembers , vividly , being hit by a bag of urine . " We were kids , " he says . " We did n't know what the war was about or where Vietnam even was . The result of my experience there and my return to such hatred made me shut down for the better part of the last 25 years . " In the early ' 90s , Ramos experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him did n't come until 1997 , on the bike trip through the rice paddies of Vietnam and the dark eddies of his past . The trip was sponsored by World Team Sports , a group that uses sports to build bridges between people . More than 50 American GIs and former Vietcong took part in the journey . Many were disabled from the war - blind , deaf , lame . " The whole place was nothing like I remembered it , " he says . " It was awesomely beautiful , solemn , and plain . The people treated us like kings . They opened their arms , hearts , and homes . " Each day the bikers would stop at hospitals and other places to eat . These became cathartic moments . The talk flowed . Many of the GIs told stories they had kept closeted for 30 years . At one point , a former Vietnamese soldier who had lost his right leg in the war , and was wearing a prosthetic limb , challenged a former American GI , who had lost his right leg in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off over a wooden bridge . The rest of the bikers watched , in chilled silence . " I was always waiting for some miracle cure , but did n't realize until I saw these people , who had suffered far more than me , to drop it , " says Ramos of the overall experience . " I was so moved , I came to peace with myself . " When Mark Stewart left Vietnam , the marine had lost sight in one eye and suffered 28 wounds from a shrapnel attack that killed several members of the platoon he led in 1968 . Since then , he says , his greatest sense of peace has come from helping people - in Vietnam and around the world . At the height of the African famine in the 1980s , the Ketchum , Idaho , native spent three years in the Sudan . He and his wife ran a food and medical clinic that daily fed 500 street children - boys and girls who had ended up in Khartoum , the capital city , after their parents had died of hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can possibly imagine , " he says . After turning over the clinic to local Sudanese , the couple returned to North America . Beginning in 1990 , they worked to help the victims of the war against the contras in Guatemala and Nicaragua , aiding injured people with prosthetics and working with women to improve literacy , so they could help themselves . Five years later , they left , fearing for their safety . It was then that they thought of Vietnam . Seeking a place that would be peaceful - but needed help - they got a 30-day visa to travel from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City . Mr. Stewart says they only needed a few hours to realize this is where they needed to be . He rallied support back in Ketchum and later became executive director of East Meets West , an organization that for the past 13 years has been helping the Vietnamese build schools and hospitals and repair infrastructure . " Returning to Vietnam regularly has convinced me these are a people who are incredibly hardworking , industrious , with a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . He says the country is the safest of any he has ever traveled in and is " so open that it would be impossible to be harboring MIAs in cages , " as some people still fear . Jim Doyle was 19 when he was drafted . As soon as he arrived , he assumed the dangerous position of " point man " for the First Infantry Division northwest of Ho Chi Minh City , then Saigon . Back then , he led his platoon through the bush . Today , he still scours the countryside , but as a part of a program to help the Vietnamese uncover the remains of those still missing from the war . Mr. Doyle has made several trips to the country since 1995 as part of the initiative . So far , American veterans have provided information on 7,000 missing Vietnamese , of which 800 have been recovered for burial . It has also made him a leader in the effort to find American MIAs . Nine months after he participated in a repatriation ceremony in Hanoi for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doyle arrived home to find that one of the soldiers was from his home town , Fresno , Calif . " The repatriation ceremony helped me feel like I had fulfilled my original pledge as a soldier to never leave any comrade behind , " says Doyle , now chairman of the national public affairs committee for Vietnam Veterans of America . This desire to look forward - while not being unmindful of what came before - is a crucial part of what Doyle thinks Clinton must accomplish while in Vietnam . " It is important for Clinton and the Vietnamese to ... talk about better relations and trade , " he says . " But many of these issues of the past - MIAs , undetonated land mines , lingering fallout from Agent Orange - have become contemporary issues . To try to close the book on the past by ignoring it wo n't work either . " Coming back to help his old adversaries , he says , is what 's helped him get over painful memories . He said he came back from Vietnam disillusioned about his naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three decades later , his own work in Vietnam and his witnessing of other veterans who work on humanitarian efforts such as clinics and schools have helped bring fulfillment of his original ideals . " I went over as a kid thinking I was helping a cause , and now 30 years later , I feel we are finally helping them with the mission we originally went over to do , " says Doyle . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 .
