<p> SANTA MONICA , Calif.  --  Honda 's 2007 Fit , one of a trio of Japanese subcompacts hitting the market this year , is roomy , comfortable and fun well beyond what comes to mind when you hear " small car " or " subcompact . " <p> Unfortunately , it is priced beyond what comes to mind , too : $14,400 to start , an additional $1,500 typically equipped  --  as much as a larger , if less lavishly appointed , Civic . <p> Honda says " entry level " does n't mean " cheap . " Honda says its customers tend to demand more stuff and will pay higher prices to get it . Honda says Fit is the best-equipped of the economy cars , providing an array of standard features that often cost extra on rivals , such as anti-lock brakes , multiple air bags and climate control . <p> Honda also says it plans to sell only 50,000 a year of the Japan-built Fit in the USA , a relatively easy target that wo n't require a bargain price to hit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Toyota Yaris small car , just now going on sale . But the base Yaris is a two-door ; Fit is a four-door . The base Yaris ( Test Drive , Dec. 30 ) has no stereo , air conditioning or ABS . The base Fit does . The base Yaris clearly is an economy car . The base Fit clearly is not . <p> Nissan 's Versa ( not yet tested ) goes on sale later this year and has n't been priced yet . <p> The Fit Sport , which Honda says will be the preferred version , starts at $15,720 . Sport is all cosmetics ; it does n't have a bigger engine or stiffer suspension as the name implies . <p> Based on drives in pre-production cars on city and canyon roads around here , it seems as if Fit could be a hit because : <p> *It 's fun . The 1.5-liter , 109-horsepower , four-cylinder engine is eager and responsive and has to propel only 2,500 pounds of automobile . That 's about 1,000 pounds less than a midsize family sedan weighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague , notchy feel . The clutch takes only a light touch from your left foot . <p> The five-speed automatic has manual-shift paddle switches on the steering wheel spokes . And you do n't have to move the floor-mounted gearshift into a special mode to use the paddle shifters . All you need to do is finger-touch the left-hand paddle to downshift , the right one to upshift . Once the gearbox decides you 're back to a steady state , it 'll upshift and return to automatic mode . If you want fully manual operation , pull the floor lever into " S " position ( for sport ) and the transmission surrenders its automatic function and lets you choose . <p> Fit 's suspension is firm enough for sporty handling , such as through the curves on Topanga Canyon Road . Electric power steering  --  getting more common in the industry because it saves fuel  --  is well-tuned so that the steering feels properly weighted and linear , neither light and twitchy , nor heavy and balky as some electric steering systems can be . <p> *It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back seats fold forward to expand the cargo area , as you 'd expect in any hatchback . The back-seat cushions also lift and stow against the upright rear seat backs , opening cargo space in the center of the car for a tall plant or priceless Monet painting . The front passenger seat folds back level with the folded second row , providing 7 feet , 10 inches of clear space on the passenger 's side for a surfboard , rolled-up carpet , whatever , while leaving a usable passenger seat behind the driver . <p> The front seats have release latches high on the sides so that if you 're at the open back door and fiddling with the second-row seats , you do n't have to come clear around to the front door to slide the front seats forward to provide maneuvering room . <p> *It 's comfortable . Front and back seats both seem roomy and supportive . There 's enough knee- and legroom in back for long-limbed adults even when the front seats are all the way back . The back of the rear seat can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classy . The materials seem of high quality and the textures were rich in the test cars . Knobs and other controls worked more smoothly than you find in some bigger , pricier vehicles . <p> What might bother you about the Fit : <p> *The gas tank is under the front seat . That 's how Honda got extra room for the rear seats to fold down so far and open so much cargo space . Should n't matter , Honda says : Buyers in other countries have n't objected ; extra safety engineering has been done to protect the tank from crash damage ; tanks typically are under the back seat anyway , so what 's the big deal about moving them forward a little ? <p> Here 's betting that some potential buyers will simply not like the idea of riding atop 10 gallons of gasoline . <p> *The car 's details are n't all modern . Fit does n't have so-called retained power , which lets you continue playing the radio or raise a forgotten power window after you shut off the ignition . Honda 's never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums , instead of more-effective discs . Rear suspension 's solid beam instead of better-handling independent setup . <p> A horizontal sliding lever controls whether the climate control is recirculating the air or pulling in fresh air . That 's an out-dated control , replaced in most cars by a more elegant button or even automatic recirculation control , linked to the climate control setting . <p> You ca n't get satellite radio . Outrageous because Honda is a major investor in XM Satellite Radio . It 's common for vehicles developed in Japan to overlook the growing popularity of satellite radio in the USA . Dangerously out of touch . <p> Base Fit models get dorky wheel covers ( hubcaps by another name ) instead of true alloy wheels . <p> What could overcome those failings , though , is that Fit is an exceptionally pleasing package . A demonstration of the seat configurations and a simple drive around the block , especially if it involves parking in a tight spot , is likely to be all the sales pitch needed . <p> 2007 Honda Fit *What is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to Honda 's U.S. lineup .
