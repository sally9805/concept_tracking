<p> Armando Benitez lumbered across the mostly empty Florida Marlins clubhouse devouring a jumbo hot dog . He stopped near his locker and took a bite but then vanished into another room to finish his supersize snack . <p> When Benitez reappeared several minutes later , he still moved slowly . He pulled his jersey over his head , he corrected someone who had inadvertently shorted him by one save , and , after an interview request , Benitez was suddenly in a hurry . He declined to speak until after the game , until after he had possibly chased those elusive three outs . <p> Eric Gagne of the Los Angeles Dodgers was about 100 feet away down the hall at Pro Player Stadium . Well , Gagne was in the clubhouse somewhere , but he was more of a ghost than Benitez . He spent about 30 seconds by his locker during pit stops between the trainer 's room , the shower room and the food room . <p> Gagne might have sneaked in a workout , too , because he was sweating as he stomped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie on a big-screen television and seemed busy . Like Benitez , Gagne was several hours away from knowing if he would be pursuing those three outs . <p> They are both closers , pitchers who are typically responsible for getting three outs , the final three outs and often the toughest three outs . There is no second chance for a closer . There is only tomorrow , that is , if the closer gets to keep his pressure-packed position . <p> Gagne , 28 , has been a better closer than anyone else in baseball . He had his 73rd straight save Saturday , extending a record streak that dates from August 2002 . Benitez has been good , not great . His resume has been smudged by a tendency to disintegrate in crucial games . <p> This is a peek at how they went about their jobs on Tuesday , a peek at how two men chased three outs . <p> " Every time I step on the mound , you have to be a good liar and an idiot , " Gagne said , sitting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to lie to yourself and be an idiot to believe your lies . You got to go out there and know you 're going to be the best . Just think it . " <p> So was Gagne admitting he was a liar and an idiot ? Of course , Gagne said . The mental aspect of closing is paramount to Gagne , who visualizes those three outs long before getting them . <p> " Even if you might not feel great and might not have a positive attitude in your head , you got to get it somehow , " Gagne said . " I try to do that every time I step on the field . I try to feel invincible . " <p> Shortly before Gagne spoke , Benitez talked to the Dodgers ' Robin Ventura , his former Mets and Yankees teammate , on the field . Benitez had famous implosions with the Mets and lasted about three weeks with the Yankees after they acquired him last year  --  not the topics Ventura planned to discuss . Still , Benitez supplied ground rules . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about New York , ' " Ventura said . " He said that 's why he liked it here so much . He 's happy . He 's relaxed . " <p> Benitez , 31 , is having a superb year for the Marlins , the defending World Series champions . Entering Tuesday , he was 10 for 10 in save chances , had struck out 17 and walked 5 in 16 innings , and had an 0.56 earned run average . Florida 's Lenny Harris , who also played with Benitez on the Mets , said the calm environment is perfect for Benitez . <p> " You go anywhere in New York and they tell you you 've got to beat the Yankees , " Harris said . " You go in Miami and nobody really gives a hoot about anything with baseball . " <p> Manager Jack McKeon punctuates Benitez 's saves by hugging him , something that not even the protective Bobby Valentine did for Benitez when he managed the Mets . No one with the Yankees dreamed of hugging Benitez . <p> " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big teddy bear likes the atmosphere , saying he relishes the fact that " I have the team behind me , the support . " <p> Benitez did not want to talk about how he was treated with other teams . Told that his nonanswer could be construed as his feeling unsupported elsewhere , Benitez said , " If you see it , you keep it . " <p> Josh Beckett helped guide the Marlins to a 3-2 lead on Tuesday , so the big teddy bear had the first chance for a save in the ninth . He started by uncorking a 92-mile-an-hour fastball to Shawn Green , followed by two balls . Harris said one of the big differences between Benitez and the Yankees ' Mariano Rivera is that Rivera rarely lets a hitter escape once he is ahead in the count , so the pressure is always on the hitter . <p> As Green fouled off four straight pitches , the at-bat was loosely reminiscent of a much more important at-bat against another tall , left-handed power hitter : Paul O'Neill in Game 1 of the 2000 World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking , then scored the tying run , tagging Benitez with a blown save . The Yankees won in extra innings . <p> Green 's at-bat climaxed with a flyout on the ninth pitch . But did it still have an impact on Benitez ? When Paul Lo Duca dribbled a ball to the right of the mound , Benitez moved carefully toward it , then whipped it wide of first for a two-base error . <p> It took Benitez one pitch to get the second out . Then Benitez put Adrian Beltre in an 0-2 hole and was one strike from keeping Gagne from pitching . The fans , all 12,000 of them , stood and howled for that elusive third out . <p> But for the first time as a Marlin , Benitez faltered . On a 1-2 pitch , Beltre reached out and blooped the ball to right field , and it fell in front of a sliding Miguel Cabrera for a game-tying single . The big teddy bear was not jolly . He hoisted his arms above his shoulders and shouted . <p> " Like I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when asked about his antics . " I always have my confidence . " <p> This was not the postseason , in which he has blown four of his last seven save opportunities , and Benitez was victimized by his error and a bloop . But Harris said Benitez still had a reputation to shed . <p> " I think that 's something he has to get over , the big games , " Harris said . " Can he close out these big games ? He can get these saves here and there and be competitive , but , to clear his name , I think that he has to do something special , and that 's to win in the postseason . " <p> There was little chance to quiz Benitez about Harris 's comments or any other topic ; he refused to discuss anything after he was asked about pitching in New York . <p> Benitez pitched a scoreless 10th , but the Dodgers scored a run off Justin Wayne in the 11th , and it was Gagne 's turn . He had a 4-3 lead and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outs . <p> " I do n't win the game , " he said . " I just pitch one inning and close it . " <p> Gagne watches the first five or six innings on television because he gets better angles on how hitters are reacting . When he leaves the clubhouse , Gagne discusses anything but the game , he said , because that is too mentally draining . <p> " I tell him stories , " Ventura said . " That 's my job here . " <p> The story with Gagne is about perfection , utter and absolute perfection . Gagne throws four pitches  --  a fastball , a changeup , a curveball and a slider  --  so he is the rare closer who attacks hitters in a variety of ways . <p> In the bottom of the 11th , he unleashed four fastballs to Alex Gonzalez , all 97 or 98 m.p.h. , and struck him out swinging . One out . He fooled Hee Seop Choi with two nasty changeups , then pumped another 98-m.p.h. heater . Choi swung helplessly . Two outs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed oblivious to it . He fired two strikes to Damion Easley and was one strike from another save , another addition to the nearly two-year-old streak . <p> But first , the unkempt Gagne surprisingly decided at that moment that he needed to tidy up . He dropped his glove behind the mound , bent his knees and tucked in the front of his shirt . He looked like a couch potato shoving his T-shirt into his pants upon arising for the 30-foot journey to the refrigerator . <p> " Oh , he 's a pig , " Ventura said playfully . " He 's definitely a pig . " <p> The slightly tidier Gagne tossed three straight balls . <p> Was a tucked shirt Gagne 's kryptonite ? Forget it . He threw a fastball that Easley fouled off and uncorked another one that Easley stared at for strike three . Gagne pumped his fist , invincible again . He had the three outs . <p> Although Gagne has never been tested in the postseason , Ventura dismissed that as a serious issue and promised Gagne would be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rivera is considered the best postseason closer ever . <p> As Ventura sipped a beer , he veered from complimenting the perfect closer to doing the same for the imperfect closer . Ventura said he trusted Benitez with the Mets and added , " I 'd still take my chances with him because not everyone can have Gagne or Rivera . " <p> Not everyone can get those three outs , either . This time , only Gagne did . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com right , Associated Press ) Benitez had saved 10 straight games for Florida before his throwing error led to his first blown save of the season .
