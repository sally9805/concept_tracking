Crashed out on a pile of purple cushions in her trailer , the Woman of the Future does not look as though she could clean your clock . Yet as Max , the bioengineered heroine of Dark Angel , the dystopian sci-fi drama from Titanic 's James Cameron , Jessica Alba sports skintight bodysuits and leather as , swaggering lean and feline ( literally : Max has cat DNA ) , she dives through windows and KO 's tough guys twice her size . Now , barefoot and swaddled in a massive black turtleneck and baggy jeans , it 's as if she has been shrunk within her clothes . <P> Being superhuman , Alba says , can be a pain in the rear end . The other day , she hung for several hours from a building in a harness , sitting on two grips ' heads between takes while the crew fiddled with the camera angles . She spent another marathon session hanging from a bar above the set , praying her hands did n't go numb before she dropped  --  " ' catlike , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Then , ' he said , ' You just glide over to the door . ' I 've never done this before ! Dropping 6 ft. and not falling on my butt is an accomplishment ! " <P> Actors , Alba among them , will always tell you it 's about the craft . Being the character , living the memories , blah blah blah . Which is true  --  but let 's not kid ourselves . Alba 's role is a physical one , and not just because of the Matrix-y martial-arts scenes , for which she studied kung fu and gymnastics . In the Buffy age , you 're no heroine if you 're not a babe , and the curvy Alba , 19 , was pegged as TV 's next hot young thing a year before the show even debuted . <P> But there 's also a thematic relevance to Alba 's looks .

" <P> Yet save for the occasional Uhura ( Star Trek ) or Lando Calrissian ( Star Wars ) , sci-fi has tended to look as white as space is black . Dark Angel is an exception . Cameron and his co-creator , Charles Eglee , have created a year 2020 that is intriguing ( economic depression , lawlessness and authoritarianism set in after terrorists sabotage America 's computers ) . " We said , ' Let 's take our optimistic runaway prosperity and just drop-kick it , ' " says Cameron . But just as captivating is the show 's mix of black , brown , white and yellow faces . It was a conscious decision , says Eglee , to reflect the diversity of the setting  --  Seattle , icon of the new economy . <P> Dark Angel ( Fox , Tuesdays starting Oct. 3 , 9 p.m . E.T. ) is also , as co-star Michael Weatherly puts it , a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eglee , a veteran of Moonlighting and Murder One , originally thought of the show as " an urban youth ensemble . " Cameron came up with the terrorist " infocalypse " and the central character  --  a bike-messenger-cum-thief , on the run from the military program that created her , who partners with an underground journalist named Logan ( Weatherly ) to search for her roots .
