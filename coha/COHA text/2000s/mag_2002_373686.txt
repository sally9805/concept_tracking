Chances are you have n't read the Bush Administration 's " National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace . " Since it weighs in at a hefty 65 pages , who can blame you ? Still , a surprising amount of the draft report is aimed at home-computer owners . Here 's the gist : the more dependent we become on the Internet , the more damage can be done by taking down large portions of it . And it does n't take a criminal genius to realize that PC users , with their increasingly high-speed connections and low-grade security setups , are the easiest on-ramp for any kind of attack . <P> Though the report does n't tap terror groups by name , the implication is clear : if you do n't practice good PC hygiene now , al-Qaeda or some organization like it could one day hijack your hard drive . That 's not just homeland-security hype . In 2001 , viruses and other malicious code caused $12 billion worth of damage to the U.S. economy with the aid of unsuspecting users . How to stop that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pretty familiar : do n't open strange email attachments ; do install a firewall ; choose passwords that are n't easy to crack . <P> But here 's one important security measure the report failed to mention : check your hard drive for spyware . Spyware is any kind of program installed in your computer without your consent to gather information about you or your organization . A typical piece of spyware will watch over your shoulder while you browse the Web , record your mouse clicks and broadcast all that information back to another computer ( ostensibly for marketing purposes ) . It 's part of a class of increasingly surreptitious software that includes adware ( which serves up commercials you did n't ask for  --  as if pop-up ads were n't enough ) , stealware ( which leeches sales commissions away from small websites in affiliate programs ) and scumware ( which alters the origin of links on a Web page so that , for example , an innocent news headline will direct you to a porn site ) . <P> How does this stuff get onto your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you download it . If you 're a heavy user of post-Napster file-sharing programs like Morpheus or Kazaa , both known distributors of spyware , you 're probably already infected . Sometimes spyware masquerades as cookies , those little files websites leave on your computer so you do n't have to type your name and password every time you visit . Once on your PC , spyware can sequester itself deep inside your operating system in what are called registry files . Anti-virus software wo n't spot it , because it looks like something you chose to install . <P> Luckily , it 's easy to check your computer for spyware . If you own a Windows machine , just go to
