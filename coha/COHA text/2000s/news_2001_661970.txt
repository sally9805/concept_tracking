She underwent surgery July 14 . <p> " When she fell she was immediately unconscious and remains unconscious at this time , " Miller said July 16 . <p> At the family 's request , no additional details about her injuries were disclosed . <p> Graham 's son Donald E. Graham , chairman of the Post company , was with his mother , along with daughter Elizabeth " Lally " Weymouth . Family members were not granting interviews . <p> Katharine Graham arrived in Sun Valley on July 10 , Knight said . The gathering , the Allen &; Co . Annual Conference , is held by investment banker Herbert Allen Jr . for business , communication and entertainment executives . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene Meyer , had purchased The Washington Post at a bankruptcy auction . She took over the Post company in 1963 after the suicide of her husband , Philip Graham , and built it into a media empire that ranked on the Fortune 500 list by the time she turned over the reins to her son in 1991 . <p> The Post 's resurgence was most visible during the turbulent 1970s , in the showdown over the Pentagon Papers , a secret study of the Vietnam War , and in the newspaper 's dogged pursuit of the Watergate scandal that brought down President Nixon . <p> From a business standpoint , she built the Post company into a profitable conglomerate of newspaper , magazine , broadcast and cable properties , including Newsweek . <p> Her autobiography , " Personal History , " won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 . She wrote of her long struggle to overcome the feelings of inadequacy she felt upon taking charge of the Post . <p> In 1974 , she was the first woman elected to The Associated Press board of directors , serving the maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newspaper Publishers Association from 1980 through 1982 . That group later became part of the Newspaper Association of America . <p> &gt;+++++ Dow Jones to cut 150 additional jobs <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - Dow Jones &; Co. , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , said July 11 it is cutting about 150 additional jobs because of a rapid decline in advertising revenues . <p> The company disclosed July 12 that it has eliminated a total of 429 jobs this year , or 5 percent of its work force , which stood at 8,574 at the beginning of the year . Those reductions have come in two waves , one in April and one that began a few weeks ago . The company said earlier it had cut 225 jobs in April and 16 jobs last week at The Wall Street Journal . <p> The company has taken other cost-cutting measures , including the shutdown of its unprofitable business portal Work.com . <p> The newspaper industry is suffering from the worst advertising decline in a decade . Gannett Co. , Knight Ridder and The New York Times Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hard hit due to its heavy reliance on technology and financial advertising as well as the disappearance of dot-com promotional spending . Advertising linage is off 34 percent at The Wall Street Journal in the year to date through May . <p> The company reported that its second-quarter earnings fell 57 percent amid a steep drop-off in advertising . It also warned July 12 that third-quarter earnings would come in well below analysts ' expectations . <p> Dow Jones posted net income of $ 43.2 million , or 50 cents per share , for the three-month period ending June 30 , compared to $ 100.6 million or $ 1.13 a share in the same period a year ago . <p> Revenues were off 18 percent , dropping to $ 484.1 million from $ 593.2 million a year ago , when the company was still enjoying a surge in advertising . <p> Taking out the effects of charges for work force reductions , a write-down at the online edition of the Journal and an accounting gain , the company earned $ 45.5 million during the second quarter , or 52 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call . <p> Dow Jones , which has been reluctant to give investors guidance for future earnings due to the uncertain economic climate , also said it now expected earnings in the third quarter to be in the range of 20 to 30 cents a share . Analysts had been expecting 55 cents a share . <p> Like other newspaper publishers , Dow Jones has been cutting costs aggressively as it copes with a steep downturn in advertising as the economy slows and as dot-promotional spending has disappeared . Richard Zannino , the company 's chief financial officer , said that Dow Jones had cut $ 150 million in costs so far this year . <p> The company 's cost-cutting measures extended into many areas of operations : Employees at the company 's headquarters in lower Manhattan received a memo July 11 announcing that the company would no longer pay to water office plants , a decision the memo said would save $ 40,000 a year . <p> Employees at the office and in New Brunswick , N.J. , were given until July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or take home . The memo said the rest would be thrown away . <p> Revenues at Dow Jones print publishing operation , which make up the bulk of the company 's business , were off 26 percent to $ 312.8 million compared to the same period a year ago . <p> At the same time , Dow Jones also reported that advertising linage at the Journal fell 39 percent in June compared to the same month a year ago , and 35 percent in the year to date . <p> For the first six months of the year , Dow Jones posted net earnings of $ 49.4 million or 57 cents a share , compared to $ 189.2 million or $ 2.12 a share in the same period a year earlier . Revenues fell 17 percent to $ 944 million from $ 1.14 billion . <p> In addition to the Journal , Dow Jones publishes Dow Jones Newswires , Barron 's magazine , some smaller newspapers and numerous stock market indicators , including the Dow Jones industrial average . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> Audit Bureau OKs changes in magazine circulation rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Circulations gave final approval to a sweeping overhaul of magazine circulation rules , opening the way for publishers to try new marketing efforts as they confront a steady decline in circulation . <p> The group also passed guidelines defining electronic sales of newspapers , allowing publishers to create and sell new , electronic editions of their publications and still have them count as paid circulation . <p> The revision to the magazine rules , the most far-reaching for that industry since the Audit Bureau was formed in 1914 , was passed initially in March . An overhaul of newspaper circulation rules was also approved in March . <p> The magazine rule changes received final approval July 14 , with only minor revisions , at a meeting of the Audit Bureau 's board in Pebble Beach , Calif . <p> David Leckey , an ABC board member and circulation director at Hachette Filipacchi Magazines , said the measures were passed unanimously by the board 's 34 members , which include publishers of magazines and newspapers , as well as advertisers . <p> At the heart of the rule changes was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that no copy could be counted as paid circulation that was sold at less than half the basic price . <p> Now , copies sold at any price can be counted as paid circulation , but with greater disclosures of how much money is actually being charged for subscriptions . Advertisers want to see that information to gauge the level of reader interest in a particular magazine . <p> Publishers have been seeking greater flexibility in how they discount and promote magazine subscriptions to combat a steady erosion in circulation as other media like cable TV and the Internet compete for readers ' attention . <p> With the ability to price magazines more cheaply , publishers will now be able to try new ways of attracting readers such as giving away subscriptions at little cost with season tickets to sports events or with memberships to health clubs . <p> For newspapers , which are also facing difficulties in keeping readers , the new guidelines governing electronic editions provide an important basis for reaching out to readers in emerging electronic media . <p> " This opens a huge window of opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ABC 's newspaper committee and publisher of the Duluth ( Minn . ) News-Tribune of Minnesota . <p> The Audit Bureau has discussed electronic editions in the past , but Jacobus said the new guidelines set clear definitions of what constitutes electronic editions of a newspaper as well as how they can be sold . <p> While newspapers are just beginning to experiment with electronic sales models , Michael Lavery , president of the Audit Board , said the new guidelines should open the way for increased use of electronic formats as demand for them begins to swell among readers . <p> Electronic editions of newspapers will need to be clearly identified as a version of the main paper , but the editorial and advertising can vary , just like in regional editions of newspapers , Lavery said . <p> They can be delivered by any electronic means - e-mail , the Web or CD-ROM , for example - and will have to conform to the same rules as print versions to be counted as paid circulation , namely , be sold for at least 25 percent of the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to define and sell electronic editions . <p> On the Net : <p> Audit Bureau of Circulations : www.accessabc.com <p> &gt;+++++ News media spared in Senate office shuffle <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - News photographers and magazine writers will keep the traditional Capitol offices they had faced losing in a Senate reorganization office shuffle , Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle said . <p> As part of the Democrats ' reorganization of the Senate , the Senate secretary 's office had planned to take over the third-floor rooms of the press photographers and magazine writers . <p> But Daschle , D-S.D. , said July 11 the media would keep their traditional work areas . <p> Senate leaders had suggested that the photographers and magazine writers share space with newspaper , television and radio reporters . <p> " It was clear from the beginning that moving the press was a bad idea , especially the plan to consolidate everyone into already overcrowded galleries , " said Curt Anderson , an Associated Press reporter and chairman of the Standing Committee of Correspondents . " We 're pleased the new Senate leadership listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been for decades . " <p> Anderson said media organizations from around the country flooded Senate leaders with letters and telephone calls protesting the proposed change , which " was a major factor in helping us make our case . " <p> Daschle also apologized for the way the proposed move was handled . <p> Senate officials waited until after 5 p.m . Friday , June 29 , to reveal the proposed move . The photographers and magazine reporters were told that they would have to vacate their offices by the next Monday , although a delay was granted later . <p> &gt;+++++ Investigative reporters ripped off at conference <p> CHICAGO ( AP ) - While journalists gathered to discuss better ways to gather information , somebody was gathering information about them and using it to buy electronic equipment and other items . <p> At least three journalists attending a conference of investigative reporters at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago last month discovered someone had used their credit card numbers to make some online purchases . <p> " Am I the only one to see the irony in a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card fraud ? " Russell Clemings of The Fresno ( Calif . ) Bee e-mailed his fellow reporters after seeing a mysterious charge of more than $ 300 show up on his credit card . <p> The answer is no . <p> " I suppose it is fairly ironic that while people inside are telling wonderful stories about electronic privacy , we 're getting our credit cards ripped off , " the Houston Chronicle 's Dan Feldstein said July 12 . <p> His credit card was used to purchase - unsuccessfully - some DVD equipment . He said the purchase never went through because Sears.com called him to ask why somebody in Houston would have equipment delivered to an address in Chicago . <p> Stephen Miller of The New York Times did n't get such a call . Instead he got a bill that showed he took time out from the convention to spend about $ 1,000 to buy a refrigerator and a big screen television . <p> The Secret Service , which has jurisdiction in cases involving the unauthorized use of credit cards , is investigating . <p> Linda Calderon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the matter . But she said she was not prepared to discuss it . <p> &gt;+++++ Boston Globe settles with housing group over ads <p> BOSTON ( AP ) - The Boston Globe will send classified employees to training sessions and pay $ 55,000 to a public interest group to settle a complaint over the newspaper 's printing of discriminatory real estate ads . <p> The Fair Housing Center of Greater Boston accused the newspaper of violating the Federal Fair Housing Act by printing ads containing phrases such as " adults , " " ideal for couple , " or " no section 8 , " a reference to a federal rent subsidy program . <p> " We take thousands and thousands of ads every week , " said Globe spokesman Richard Gulla . " We think our staff does a terrific job of handling these things . But some of them have slipped through . " <p> Federal law prohibits advertising a preference or limitation based on race , national origin , sex , family status , disability or religion . <p> In addition , Massachusetts law prohibits preferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics . <p> Under the settlement , the paper will revise its policies regarding the ads , use a computer program to monitor for possible violations and hold training sessions for staff and supervisors on fair housing . <p> The paper also will run public service announcements and put equal-housing notices in its Sunday real estate section . It will pay the center $ 30,000 for public education on fair housing and $ 25,000 in damages and attorneys ' fees . <p> &gt;+++++ Columbia awards Cabot prizes to four journalists <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - Four journalists , including the South America bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times , have been awarded 2001 Maria Moors Cabot Prizes for their coverage of Latin America , Columbia University announced July 13 . <p> The winners are Monica Gonzalez , Jorge Ramos , Clovis Rossi and Sebastian Rotella . <p> The Cabot awards , in their 63rd year , honor reporters and editors who have " demonstrated commitment to freedom of the press and inter-American understanding .

Microsoft had committed to selling its stake . <p> As part of the deal announced July 16 , Diller , who is chairman and chief executive of USA Networks , also will acquire National Leisure Group Inc. , another online travel company .

His entertainment properties include the USA cable channel , the Sci-Fi Channel and a film and television studio . <p> Expedia shareholders are to receive $ 35.50 in USA Networks stock for each share of Expedia , plus stock warrants .

" Cameras will rotate among news anchors and reporters grouped at a circular desk . <p> The changes acknowledge that viewers are pressed for time and want to be able to get information as quickly as possible , Ryan said . <p> The news channel , like sister station CNN , also faces increased competition from relative newcomers MSNBC and Fox News Channel and is searching for an edge to help boost viewership . <p> Sports , business and other categories still will be offered at fixed times during a 15-minute news rotation on the channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally dubbed CNN2 . <p> Thompson , who left " NYPD Blue " and acting to pursue a career in TV journalism , will share prime-time co-anchor duties with Miles O Brien , who is also a CNN correspondent . <p> Other members of the new CNN Headline News team are culture and entertainment anchor Alisha Davis , breaking anchor Sachi Koto , political correspondent Michele Mitchell , technology news anchor Kris Osborn , business correspondent Patricia Sabga and sports anchor Larry Smith . <p> &gt;+++++ PGA Tour agrees to new TV deals with networks <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - In deals driven in part by Tiger Woods ' popularity , the PGA Tour agreed to new TV packages that increase its take by hundreds of millions of dollars . <p> The contracts with ABC , CBS , NBC , ESPN , USA and The Golf Channel , announced July 16 , run from 2003-06 and are worth about $ 850 million , according to two industry sources , speaking on condition of anonymity . <p> That figure represents an increase of about 45 percent from the tour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Everyone involved has Woods to thank , at least in part .

" I think it 's a fair financial deal for us and the tour .

( AP ) - Rick Lewis , known to millions of NASCAR fans as the radio " Voice of Daytona , " was killed in an apparently botched murder-suicide with his wife , police said July 13 . <p> Lewis , 52 , who was the studio voice of the Motor Racing Network for 18 years , was found dead on July 11 on a bed in his South Daytona home , a gunshot wound to the head . <p> His wife of 35 years , Wanda , was found wounded next to him . She had also been shot in the head . A handgun lay between them . The 51-year-old woman was hospitalized in serious condition . <p> Investigators said they were uncertain who pulled the trigger . <p> Rick Lewis ' voice opened and closed every NASCAR radio broadcast - more than 80 races a year , including the Winston Cup Series , Busch Series and the Grand National Division . The broadcasts are heard on more than 600 stations in 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will be sorely missed , " network President David Hyatt said . <p> Lewis ' death follows another NASCAR tragedy , the fatal crash of driver Dale Earnhardt at the Daytona 500 in February . <p> On the Net : <p> Motor Racing Network : http : //www.mrnradio.com <p> NASCAR : http : //www.nascar.com <p> &gt;+++++ FCC finds owner morally unfit , revokes license <p> ST . LOUIS ( AP ) - For the first time in many years , the Federal Communications Commission is revoking a station license because it found the owner morally unfit . <p> Michael Rice , of St. Charles , has been informed by the FCC that within 90 days he will lose his license to operate five Midwest radio stations . <p> Rice was convicted in 1994 of sodomizing five boys ages 10 to 16 . He was released from Farmington Correctional Center in 1999 after serving five years of an eight-year sentence . <p> Rice , 59 , says he suffered from bipolar disorder but that he is now rehabilitated . <p> The FCC plans to auction Rice 's licenses . He owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three stations in Terre Haute , Ind . He also has construction permits for stations in Cuba , Mo. , and Huntsville , Mo . <p> Such severe FCC action is rare . Spokeswoman Audrey Spivack said she and fellow staff members could not even recall the last time the FCC revoked a license for character reasons . However , the agency has revoked the licenses of convicted drug traffickers in accordance with unrelated drug laws . <p> Broadcasters applauded the FCC 's decision , but Rice 's attorney said the ruling raises tough questions about the agency 's character policy . Lawyer J. Brian DeBoice maintains that the FCC abused its powers by punishing Rice for acts that are unrelated to his ability to run radio stations . <p> After a three-year investigation , the commission moved to revoke Rice 's licenses in 1998 because of his conviction . It also argued that Rice filed false reports with the FCC . <p> The FCC sometimes sanctions owners for bad business practices , but it may punish owners for poor character . It defines character as " the likelihood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Communications Act and our rules and policies . " <p> An appeals court agreed that Rice 's crime cast doubt on his ability to follow those regulations . The Supreme Court opted in March not to hear the case . <p> Rice has filed an appeal with the commission , urging it to review new evidence . He said information about his illness was never presented to the FCC . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> COURTS-MEDIA : <p> Judge orders Clear Channel executive to testify <p> TOLEDO , Ohio ( AP ) - A judge has ordered the head of Clear Channel Communications Inc. to offer testimony in a lawsuit filed by a newspaper reporter who alleges she was slandered on a radio show . <p> Sandra Svoboda filed suit in January 2000 , saying WVKS-FM host Denny Schaffer made defamatory statements about her to discredit her employer , The Blade . She is seeking damages in excess of $ 25,000 . <p> Clear Channel is the station 's parent company and was named as a defendant . <p> Lucas County Common Pleas Judge William Skow last week granted a motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to submit to a deposition . San Antonio-based Clear Channel is the nation 's largest radio broadcaster . <p> The lawsuit alleged Schaffer said several times in October 1999 that Svoboda was dating the newspaper 's co-publisher and editor in chief , John Robinson Block . Svoboda said the statements were false . <p> The newspaper is not involved in Svoboda 's lawsuit . <p> In 1999 , The Blade sued another Clear Channel station in Toledo , WSPD-AM , accusing it of using the newspaper 's stories on the air without crediting the newspaper or obtaining permission . The radio station 's morning host , Mark Standriff , had used the slogan , " I Read The Blade So You Do n't Have To . " <p> In a settlement , Standriff agreed to give credit to the newspaper when he uses the newspaper 's stories on the air . The station did not acknowledge any wrongdoing . <p> &gt;+++++ Cincinnati paper , former Chiquita lawyer battle in court <p> CINCINNATI ( AP ) - Attorneys for former Chiquita banana company lawyer George Ventura asked a federal magistrate to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source for The Cincinnati Enquirer 's news reporting about the company . <p> The journalists , Cameron McWhirter and David Wells , say they have not identified any confidential sources for the Enquirer 's May 1998 news stories about Chiquita Brands International Inc . The Enquirer and its owner , Gannett Co. , also say they have not revealed any confidential sources for the Chiquita stories , which the Enquirer later apologized for and renounced . <p> Lawyers for Wells , McWhirter , Gannett and the Enquirer told U.S. Magistrate Jack Sherman Jr . on July 9 that they will continue to protect those sources under an Ohio law that allows reporters to protect the identities of confidential sources for news stories . <p> But Ventura 's lawyers argued that since he was publicly exposed and prosecuted as a result of disclosure by former Enquirer reporter Michael Gallagher , there is now no reason for Wells and McWhirter to protect Ventura 's identity . <p> The Enquirer 's lawyers said the option to protect the identity of sources belongs to the news organization and its reporters , not the sources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the information he wants is confidential under attorney-client privilege because it involves conversations Enquirer lawyers had with Wells and McWhirter . <p> Sherman took the issues under review and did not say when he will rule . <p> Ventura 's lawsuit against the Enquirer and Gannett is scheduled to go to trial in September , but both sides said the date is unlikely because of pretrial issues . The Enquirer 's lawyers said they plan to ask the court to throw out the lawsuit prior to trial . <p> Ventura says he is entitled to unspecified money damages because his exposure as a source for negative stories about Cincinnati-based Chiquita damaged his reputation and cost him a job as a partner in a Utah law firm . He is now in private law practice in Salt Lake City . <p> &gt;+++++ Charleston , S.C. , daily sues police over FOIA request <p> CHARLESTON , S.C . ( AP ) - The Post and Courier has sued the North Charleston Police Department after the agency denied the paper 's request for 911 and dispatch tapes in a fatal police shooting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file criminal charges against two white police officers accused of shooting a black man to death . <p> After Hoisington 's decision , The Post and Courier requested a copy of the 911 and dispatch tapes under the state 's Freedom of Information Act . <p> The city denied the request for the tapes , saying that Hoisington considered them evidence in the pending trial of four other men charged in connection with the case . <p> North Charleston City Attorney Brady Hair said the city took the position that the tapes were exempt from the FOIA . <p> Edward Snowden , 35 , was killed in October by two North Charleston police officers responding to a fight in the parking lot of a video store . <p> The officers were called after four white men allegedly attacked Snowden , who was black .

The journalists ' package would be even larger than Gazprom 's by four shares , he said at a news conference with Gazprom 's chief of media operations , Alfred Kokh . <p> However , the 9.5 percent stake will not be sold to Echo of Moscow staff , as journalists originally wanted - but to Yevgeny Yasin , a former economics minister and liberal politician who is host of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal as a reasonable compromise . However , Yasin is not obligated to back other Echo of Moscow journalists in voting with his shares and could side with Gazprom , Venediktov said . <p> Echo of Moscow , an independent radio station , is the last major outpost of tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky 's media empire Media-Most , whose other outlets have fallen under Gazprom 's control in recent months . <p> Media-Most and its supporters said the takeovers were commissioned by the Kremlin to silence criticism of President Vladimir Putin . Gazprom insists it was only trying to recover old debts from financially troubled Media-Most , but the outlets ' criticism of the Kremlin has shrunk considerably under the new management . <p> The value of the Echo of Moscow deal was not disclosed , but the sides said it involved a large amount of money . <p> &gt;+++++ Dublin drops ban of pre-election polls <p> DUBLIN , Ireland ( AP ) - The government dropped its proposal to ban the publication of opinion polls in the week before an election . <p> " It was a decision in Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . " There had been all-party consensus , then subsequently the opposition political parties pulled back on it .
