Section : Hands On HUMAN RESOURCES AN OPERATING MANUAL FOR BUSINESS <p> ALAN BRIDGES NEVER THOUGHT it would happen to him . But since he founded Allpoints Equipment in Tampa in 1992 , he 's been robbed on almost 50 occasions  --  by his own employees . One staffer in accounting paid part of Allpoints ' utility bills each month , then set aside a few hundred bucks to cover her home electric bill . A top finance executive included his family vehicles on Allpoints ' auto insurance plan . And another worker stole $24,000 worth of tools , equipment , and scrap metal from a job site ; he was caught hawking some items at a pawnshop . <p> Bridges eventually fired his sticky-fingered employees , but not before Allpoints , which sells racks , forklifts , and other warehouse supplies , took some damaging financial hits . Bridges has been burned so many times that he 's co-writing a book tentatively tiffed 50 Ways to Leave Your Money . " I was shell-shocked when it happened to me , and then I started digging and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Most business owners are blind to this and I can assure you most of them say , ' It wo n't happen to me . ' " <p> In fact , the average business loses the equivalent of 6 percent of revenue to fraud each year , and employees are the main culprits , according to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners , a trade group based in Austin . And though dipping into the company till is n't a new phenomenon , technology is creating new and potentially lucrative opportunities for graft . Meanwhile , corporate scandals , most notably the Enron collapse , have triggered widespread mistrust of corporations and prompted many workers to become less loyal . Timothy Dimoff , president of SACS Consulting &; Investigative Services , an Akron-based company that investigates workplace theft , says he has noticed a distinct attitude shift the past few years . " What is really changing is the number of employees who think that what they are doing is okay , " Dimoff says . " They figure the company can damn well afford it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle major responsibilities like bookkeeping , tend to be at greater risk than larger companies , according to Dimoff . And , surprisingly , veteran employees are often the culprits . Bridges , for his part , received his wake-up call when his outside accounting firm discovered that one of Allpoints ' most trusted employees  --  his payroll manager  --  was stealing from the company . The employee was using complicated bookkeeping systems that shielded him from suspicion . " Confusion is the thief 's top tool , " Bridges says . " The more confusing the system , the easier it is for people to funnel out money . " <p> To create more checks and balances , Bridges implemented a new accounting system that made the company 's books easier to understand and cross-trained employees so that several sets of eyes were examining the financials at any given time . And he now spotchecks Allpoints ' books and bank statements . To cut down on equipment theft , he now requires workers to sign out company tools before taking them to job sites . " It becomes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block as many of the ways you could be getting ripped off as possible . Can you plug every hole ? No . But you can plug most of them . " <p> Many companies simply have " sloppy controls , " according to Dimoff . For example , he worked with one manufacturing company that was experiencing a tremendous amount of theft during the night shift . It did n't take him long to pinpoint the problem : His client 's employees could exit the building through 14 different doors with little or no supervision . Dimoff advised the client to close off the majority of exits , install security cameras at each working exit , and assign managers to supervise the night shift . The theft was all but eliminated . <p> Focusing on prevention is a smart idea , considering that employee theft is often difficult to prosecute . When Bridges confronted the finance executive who put his family members on Allpoints ' auto insurance plan , the staffer claimed that he had negotiated the perk when he was hired . A lawyer advised Bridges against pursuing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said " situation . It would be particularly hard to prove that the insurance was n't a negotiated perk , the lawyer told Bridges , because the practice had gone on for more than a year . Allpoints did prosecute one employee successfully : The worker who stole $24,000 worth of equipment , tools , and scrap metal was sentenced to five years ' probation and ordered to pay the company $3,000 . <p> Of course , the best way to prevent employee theft is to hire people who are n't likely to steal . When performing background checks , pay as much attention to credit history as criminal history , advises Scott Gane , regional vice president at Initial Security , a corporate security firm in San Antonio . Individuals who are saddled with debt are more likely to succumb to financial pressure , warns Gane . " If there are repossessions or multiple accounts closed , it shows there may be a need for monetary gain , " he says . <p> For existing employees , the first line of defense is a well-written theft policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . In the policy , explain your company 's code of ethics and include specific rules regarding the use of office supplies and companyowned equipment . Stipulate , for example , that laptops used for working at home or on business trips must be returned if an employee leaves the company . Make it clear that employees caught stealing will be prosecuted . Then require each staffer to sign the agreement . <p> Having a frank discussion with your staff can also go a long way . When you explain how theft by some workers affects the company 's bottom line and , in turn , the salaries and perks of all employees , " you start getting good employees coming forward and reporting what is happening , " Dimoff says . <p> Bridges took the straight-talk approach three years ago , after firing the finance executive involved in the auto insurance scheme . He gathered his employees for a meeting and gave them an overview of what had happened . Many of them seemed surprised , he recalls . Then he explained how employee theft was bad for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measures he planned to take to combat it . There 's no surefire way to stop theft , Bridges admits , but now his staffers know that he 's watching . <p> + Resources Visit www.inc.com/handson for more advice from the Better Business Bureau and the U.S. Small Business Administration on preventing employee theft , including a rundown of common schemes and tips for thwarting them . <p> ?
