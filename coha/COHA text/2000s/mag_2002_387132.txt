summer fun Headnote Out-of-the-ordinary vacations that kids of all ages will love Photograph On a houseboat. you can enjoy the comforts of home amid a glorious natural setting // Houseboating on a lake . Trekking with llamas . Hitting the wagon trail . A family vacation that 's just a little off the beaten path can be a memorable thrill . We 've taken several such " soft adventure " trips  --  with our families and others-and found them to be wonderful ways to slow down , revel in beautiful , uncrowded scenery and fascinating wildlife , and let the kids be kids . Often , they 're cheaper than typical package vacations . A sampling : Home on the Water Olivia , 3 , crouches at the top of the water slide . At once scared and excited , she plops down and makes a slippery descent into the lake and her mom 's waiting arms . " I want to do it again ! " she shouts . And she does , over and over , until her fingers and toes turn pruny . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private cove on Lake Powell near the Arizona-Utah border , by a salmon-colored beach flanked by towering sandstone cliffs . The boat serves as base camp for a four-day vacation for two fun-seeking families , including four kids , ages 9 years to 2 months . Our adventure began on the docks with a thorough 45  --  minute orientation on piloting and operating the boat . We 'd been assured that no houseboating experience was necessary , and soon we grown-ups were confidently taking turns at the helm , chugging smoothly along at about 20 knots ( 23 mph ) . We had decided to tow along an 18-foot speedboat for exploring the lake . We threw in some rented water toys-skis , inner tubes , kayaks-and enough food to feed twice as many people for twice as long . Photograph Life vests and calm waters let kids jump safely into the thrills of a houseboat trip // Lake Powell is a popular place for houseboating . It boasts 1,960 miles of shoreline , hundreds of picturesque coves , and 96 major canyons . The area is spectacularly beautiful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandstone walls and the sapphire-blue water . Of course , the scenery was pretty much inconsequential to the littlest ones in our group . Water play was easily at the top of their favorite-things-to-do list , followed by sand-castle building . Other options , for all ages : tubing , waterskiing , fishing , canyon exploring , hiking , and lizard hunting . On one day , we took a trip to Rainbow Bridge National Monument , the largest natural bridge in the world . Another afternoon we made our way slowly through long , winding Forgotten Canyon . At the north shore , we anchored the boat and followed a footpath to Defiance House Ruin , an ancient Anasazi Indian site , where we found large petroglyphs depicting three warrior figures etched in the sandstone walls . That evening , the kids left their own " mark " at Lake Powell , carving stick figures and their names in the sand while the adults gazed at a dazzling star-lit sky .

" " We saw a grizzly bear and drove a covered wagon just like they did in the old days ! " All true .

We rode through old Indian territory , not far from the Oregon Trail . Traveling backcountry dirt roads and worn trails , we traversed high mountain meadows and dense forests .

There the kids eagerly pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering kindling , or practiced roping an iron calf with a lariat . The food was chuckwagon fare-grilled steak and potatoes-perfect for our hearty appetites . Later , we sat around a roaring campfire to listen to cowboy songs and tall tales before retiring for the night , in either a tent or a wagon . Or , as then 5-year-old Connor suggested , " Let 's sleep on the ground just like the cowboys did ! " So we did , under a giant full moon and a canopy of stars .
