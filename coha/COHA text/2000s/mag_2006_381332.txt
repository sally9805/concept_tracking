As much as the French love fashion , soccer took precedence last week in Paris . Even at the fall 2006 haute couture fashion shows , talk inevitably turned to Zindine Zidane , or " Zizou , " France 's World Cup star . Some editors went so far as to sport les bleus  --  the team 's cobalt blue jerseys  --  in his honor . <P> If there were a fashion equivalent to the handsome player , it would be Cristobal Balenciaga , above , the great Spanish couturier who shaped fashion from 1937 , when he opened his Paris atelier , until 1968 , when he abruptly closed it . The designer 's rigorous spirit has always hovered over runways , but thanks to " Balenciaga Paris , " a sweeping retrospective of his work that just opened at Paris ' Muse de la Mode et du Textile , his influence is once again in midfield . <P> The couture runways were littered with hints of Balenciaga 's innovative cuts and use of volume . At Dior , the exaggerated shape of a horsehair skirt echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagerfeld kicked in a fuchsia cocoon coat  --  an iconic Balenciaga look . Even couture newcomer Giorgio Armani , who began showing in Paris only three seasons ago , referenced the designer with a stunningly simple A-line evening dress . <P> " He was the couturier who influenced me the most , " says Christian Lacroix , who this season showed somber , voluminous coats that hark back to Balenciaga 's work in the 1950s . " His use of materials , the graphic silhouette , the use of black and the influence of the Spanish Renaissance , lace , the pure opulence . " <P> While the relevance of haute couture , fashion 's pricey spectacle whose handmade dresses can cost as much as a car , is an open question , nobody seems to doubt the pertinence of Balenciaga  --  even three decades after his death . <P> " Many of the visitors say , ' Oh , I would like to wear that now , ' " says Pamela Golbin , curator of the exhibition along with Nicolas Ghesquire , the current designer for the reinvigorated label Balenciaga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sack dress , his semifitted suit and that cocoon coat , were culled from private collections and museums as far away as Kyoto , Japan . <P> In Balenciaga 's heyday , the stylish women he dressed  --  from Doris Duke to Mona von Bismarck  --  often said he gave them noble posture . Most women today do n't want to look quite so regal and stiff , but they do want to feel au courant , and that modern poise is perhaps Balenciaga 's most enduring legacy . <P> Balenciaga closed down his ateliers just as the student riots revved up in Paris . His reason was simple : he could n't keep up with the revolutionary spirit of the 1960s . Like great athletes , the great designers know when they have played their best .
