<p> INDIANAPOLIS  --  Jim Mora coached the Indianapolis Colts to the biggest one-season turnaround in NFL history this season . Before that , he coached the New Orleans Saints to the only winning seasons they have had . He is one of just three active coaches with more than 100 NFL victories . <p> But there is one thing Mora has never done : win a playoff game in the NFL . His Saints lost four out of four . <p> Ask Mora about this and he just shrugs . " I think about it , " he says , " but I do n't dwell on it . It 's a fact . It 's the way it is . " He pauses . " But I have a chance to change it . " <p> That chance comes Sunday , when his team plays the Tennessee Titans in the first home playoff game in the Colts ' 16-season incarnation in Indianapolis . If Mora gets that win , the Colts will be one victory shy of the Super Bowl . <p> That 's a jarring notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their quarterback is in his second season . Their running back is a rookie . If you wonder whether this team is too young to make a Super Bowl run , you 're not alone . Sometimes Mora wonders the same . <p> " I have a hard time envisioning this team in the Super Bowl , " he says . " I do n't know if that 's good or bad . Maybe that 's just my nature . I 'm not saying we ca n't go there . I do n't want them to think we ca n't go there . Sometimes it 's just . . . man , the Super Bowl ! It 's kind of , you know , beyond my . . . " <p> Here Mora stops himself and reverses field . " We 've got a shot . There are eight teams left . One of the four teams in the AFC is going to the Super Bowl , and we 're one of the four . So we 've got a shot . " <p> They have an excellent shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the NFC is the St. Louis Rams , coached by one of his best friends , Dick Vermeil . <p> The Colts improved by 10 games over last season , most in NFL history . The Rams improved by nine games , tying the old record ( set in 1929 and equaled in 1963 ) . History says such upstarts do n't win championships . Just one has reached a title game : 1988 's Cincinnati Bengals , who improved by eight games and lost Super Bowl XXIII . <p> ' One-man pep rally ' <p> Mora and Vermeil , who talk on the phone most every week , can rewrite history , maybe even against each other . If the Colts and Rams do get there , would they talk during Super Bowl week , too ? <p> " Probably more , " Mora says . <p> How is it that their teams are the NFL 's best stories this season ? <p> " Do n't ask me , " Mora says . " I think it 's a coincidence . And we happen to be two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 64 , is the oldest . But you ca n't tell by looking at him  --  his rugged good looks will fool you  --  or listening to him . He has so much energy that Colts President Bill Polian calls him " a one-man pep rally " . <p> Just ask Edgerrin James , 21 , Mora 's star rookie running back . <p> " He 's 64 ? " James asks . " You sure ? I did n't know that . He does n't look it . " <p> Neither does Vermeil , who is right behind at 63 . Vermeil voluntarily sat out of coaching for 15 seasons before taking the Rams job in a surprise move three years ago . <p> " I 'm happy for Dick , " Mora says . " He 's a really fine football coach , and the fact he was n't coaching all those years was a little bit  --  I do n't want to say sad  --  but he should have been coaching . That 's his deal . " <p> It 's Mora 's deal , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for three years as an officer in the Marine Corps fresh out of college . He had a string of jobs in the ' 50s , ' 60s and ' 70s ( including Stanford in 1967 , where he and Vermeil were assistants ) before becoming coach of the United States Football League 's Philadelphia Stars in 1983 . They went 48-13-1 in three seasons and won two championships . Next up was New Orleans , where he turned a perennial loser into a frequent winner . <p> But his 11th season in the Big Easy in 1996 went badly . After a lackluster loss at Carolina that dropped the Saints to 2-6 , he let loose a profane tirade in front of a wide-mouthed media corps . He resigned a day later . <p> Critics called it a meltdown and him a quitter . A captain is supposed to go down with the ship ; some said Mora would never coach again . He feared the same . <p> " I knew that it hurt me , " he says . " I heard from people that had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and all I would 've been maybe a stronger candidate . " <p> He got interviews in San Diego and St. Louis  --  the job Vermeil got instead  --  in 1997 . He figures others never called who might have otherwise . He was out of coaching for a year . He hated it at the time and thanks heaven for it now . The forced sabbatical gave him distance to reconnect with the game and meant he was available when the Colts came calling . <p> " I 'm really glad that ( owner ) Jim Irsay and Bill Polian gave me a second chance here , " he says . " I was fortunate . Lucky . " <p> The coach and the QB <p> One of the lucky strokes was that he came to the Colts when they had first choice in the draft , which they used to select a New Orleans native who grew up on Mora 's Saints . In one sense , Mora is the only pro coach Peyton Manning , son of Saints legend Archie Manning , has known . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school star when Mora let him throw practice passes to Saints receivers ; and when the Colts picked Manning No. 1 , look who their coach was . <p> " It 's funny how things turn out , " Manning says . " It is a small world in a lot of ways . " <p> Mora , the ex-Marine , has a reputation as a disciplined , demanding , intense coach . Manning says he likes it that way . <p> " He runs a tight ship , " Manning says . " He wants things done his way  --  but his way is the right way . It 's been done before ; it 's been proven . When you buy into that , which I think our team has , you have a good chance to do well . " <p> Pick a player and ask about his coach . Before long just about all of them will use the word " tough . " <p> " When I was a free agent thinking about signing here , I asked around about Coach Mora , " defensive end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Tough coach . He 's tough . ' So when I came on my visit , I asked him about it . He smiled and said , " Yeah , I 'm probably tougher than most . ' " <p> That 's what Mora told Bratzke . It 's not what he tells others . He 's tired of the tough-guy talk . He thinks it 's overblown and wishes folks would find a different adjective . <p> " I do n't want to give people the impression that because I was in the Marine Corps I am a certain way , " he says . " They always used to say when I was in New Orleans that I was militaristic and all that . And that 's not true . I 'm not that way . " <p> OK , militaristic is unfair . But if not tough , what word would Mora choose for himself ? <p> " I swear to God , I hate that question , " he says . " Because I do n't know . I hate to describe myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it instead : " He 's a tough personality . He expects a lot out of us . He demands we do the little things right . He sure has a lot of energy for a guy who 's 64 or whatever he is . Hey , he can yell and scream like a young guy . " <p> James : " He 's seen a lot , and he wants things done the right way . Everything about him is the same . He never changes . " <p> And Bratzke : " He never lets up , and he does n't let you let up . He 's tough but fair . If you follow the rules , you wo n't have a problem . " <p> Apply the rules <p> Defensive end Shawn King and safety Tito Wooten did not follow rules . They busted curfew on a road trip to Atlantic City in November , and Mora suspended them for five games . King called Mora " a hothead " on an Indianapolis TV station : " He blows up . He makes decisions while he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mora sees it differently : " Look , I try to be honest with my players . I try to be consistent . Demanding . I believe a lot of people talk about these things , but when it comes right down to it , they do n't apply them . I try to apply them . <p> " You 've got to have some policies and have some discipline and have some consistency . These guys get paid a lot of money . You have to get a day 's work out of them . And it has to be all the time . It ca n't be one day ' no ' and the next day ' yes . ' I mean , it 's got to be schooom , " he says , making the sound of a jet taking off . <p> " You know what I mean ? " <p> And somehow you know exactly what he means . <p> Mora 's NFL head coaching career Year Team W L Pct .
