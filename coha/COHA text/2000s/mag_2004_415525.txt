SOLUTION Headnote Rainfall alone waters these dry-climate beauties Photograph Unthirsty plants are ( clockwise from left ) : orange ' Third Harmonic ' alstroemeria , white Omphalodes linifolia , orange Glaucium grandiflorum , more Omphalodes , ' Queen Margrethe ' rose , and ' Lavender Lace ' linaria. // Anni Jensen 's garden in suburban Richmond , California , does n't have a lawn or foundation shrubs like other gardens in her neighborhood . Instead , it 's filled with native and Mediterranean plants that put out an eye-popping show of blooms in spring , fed almost entirely by rainwater . Shrubs , perennials , and annuals in Jensen 's front and backyards are uniquely adapted to her dry-summer region . Jensen , a plant propagator for Annie 's Annuals in Richmond , drew her gardening inspiration from the natural landscapes she had observed during hikes in California . " A neighbor told me that walking through my garden is like taking a stroll in Berkeley 's Tilden Regional Park Botanic Garden , " Jensen says . " It 's the greatest compliment I 've received . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , Jensen and her partner , Carol Manahan , purchased the property for its backyard , which they viewed as a blank slate with great potential . This is where Jensen regularly tries out new annuals and perennials , mostly from seeds and cuttings , and tends heirloom and English landscape roses that bloom vigorously on little or no supplemental water . Salvias and unusual flowering shrubs , which Jensen calls her " hummingbird buffet , " enhance the plantings . Photograph In winter Last season 's scraggly growth has been pruned off the perennials , and annual seedlings will soon germinate . A thick layer of mulch helps keep the garden looking neat and well groomed . In spring After the weather warms in late March and April , plants burst into bloom . Clockwise from bottom are pink Scabiosa anthemifolia , salmon farewell-to-spring ( Clarkia amoena ' Aurora ' ) , red Clarkia rubicunda ' Shamini ' , spiky Verfaascum chaixii , dark blue nigella , and orange ' Third Harmonic ' alstroemeria ( colorful , but an aggressive spreader ) . // Most garden water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fruit trees . " It 's worthwhile to grow them here , " says Jensen . " Otherwise I 'd have to drive far to buy them . " The garden 's main bloom show begins in late winter and peaks in spring . By midsummer , many plants go dormant-typical for plants from Mediterranean climates where warm , dry summers follow mild , wet winters . ( Summer dormancy is one of their survival mechanisms for times when water is scarce . ) But in summer , spent flowers on annuals such as California poppy , jewelflower , farewell-to-spring , and Nigella hispanica set and drop their seeds . When die first rains come , seeds germinate , plants perk up , and the cycle begins again . Plant and seed sources For the best selections , try one of the following sources . 1 .

That 's when most new plants go into the ground . Jensen 's advice follows . * Plant before rains come . That way , seedlings and transplants can take advantage of rainfall to establish their roots . ( When rainfall is light , give young plants supplemental waterings. ) * Sow wildflower seeds directly in the ground . Anni Jensen scatters seeds after the first or second rain , then rakes them into the soil . * Start seeds of other plants in containers . Drop the seeds on top of fine potting soil , then lightly cover them with more soil ; leave tiny seeds uncovered . Do n't let the soil dry out , and give seedlings bright light so they do n't get lanky . * Transplant . After seedlings are a few inches high , transplant them into the garden . Once they get established , many of Jensen 's annuals self-sow , carrying on the bloom show with little help from her .
