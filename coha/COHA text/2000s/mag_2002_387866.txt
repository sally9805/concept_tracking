TO HAPPIER HIKING Headnote SOMETIMES THE BEST METHODS FOR BETTER BACKPACKING ARE SO OBVIOUS IT TAKES A BUG BITE OR BLISTER TO SEE THEM . // Trail epiph*a*ny ( noun ) : A sudden realization in the backcountry that leads to more enjoyable hiking . Example : " Aha ! My dinner would be hot now if I 'd pressurized the stove . " Okay , not all backpacking wisdom is quite so obvious . Which is why we gathered 10 trail moments , big and small , that changed the way we hike . Give these techniques a try , and you 'll notice an immediate improvement in the way wild places feel . 1 GO WITH THE LOCAL FLOW THE MOMENT : We were slowly loading our packs at the bottom of Arizona 's Grand Canyon , putting off the grueling , sun-blasted ascent to the South Rim , when I noticed that the Redwall-the first 1,000 feet we 'd have to tackle-was in shadow . Remembering past ordeals , I blurted , " We have to move ... Now ! " And we did-quickly yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shady cave until the remainder of our climb fell into shadow . During the pleasant walk out , I vowed to plan future hikes for the coolest times of the day ( or warmest in winter ) , even if it meant getting up early or hiking late . I now cover just as much ground , but a lot more comfortably . THE LESSON : Time your hiking to local conditions . In the desert , avoid midday heat . In the mountains , summit peaks in the morning so ou do n't tangle with afternoon thunderstorms . When bugs swarm , schedule lunch breaks for breezy passes . Annette McGivney , Southwest Editor THE MOMENT : Hustling to get ready for a 6-day hike in the Smokies , I forgot to pack spare socks , my secret weapon against the moist  --  wool-on-heel friction that causes blisters . Sans spares , my only recourse was to fling off my boots at every rest break . My socks did n't dry completely , but my bootless breathers left my feet feeling cooler , drier , and less bruised than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-trust me , I 've had enough blisters to know . THE LESSON : Let your dogs breathe every hour , and they 'll bark less at the end of the day . Jonathan Dorn , Executive Editor 3 SUMMON YOUR INNER ANIMAL THE MOMENT : The mosquitoes were killing mein my eyes , in my mouth , in my soup-as I sat in a brushy camp in Alaska 's Brooks Range . My only solace was watching clusters of caribou lounging lazily on the high ridges and along the river . THE CARIBOU ! They were up high and on the gravel bars where the wind kept the bugs at bay . When I moved my camp from the low thicket to a gravel bar the caribou had n't yet commandeered , I left the bugs behind . THE LESSON : Study the resident wildlife , and you may learn a few local secrets : the quickest route to water , the easiest path through the brush , the juiciest blueberry patch , and more . Jeff Rennicke , Midwest Editor HIP CHECK THE MOMENT : We 'd already scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another uphill mile to the top of West Virginia 's Shenandoah Mountain . Though we carried equal loads , my hiking partner motored ahead so fast I soon lost sight of her . I struggled with each step , trying to shift my 40-pound pack to a spot that would relieve my aching shoulders and back . In desperation , I yanked and loosened straps , hoping for a miracle adjustment . Nothing . Then I hoisted the pack higher on my body than I 'd previously worn it , cinched the belt , and it settled comfortably onto my hips . The load suddenly felt 10 pounds lighter . THE LESSON : Find your hips , and you 'll find relief . To figure out where your pack 's weight should rest , pick up a wash basket or a baby with one arm . The " ledge " where you balance the weight is where you should align the center of your hipbelt . Susan Newquist 5A CAMERA IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BAG THE MOMENT : One evening in Alaska 's Arrigetch Range , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain we hoped would trap the morning 's alpenglow . Then , to our complete surprise , the last rays of sun caught a plume of cloud and the peak transformed into a smoking castle . While my partner fumbled to pull his camera out of his pack , I grabbed the one I 'd carefully placed by the door , lifted it to my eye , and snapped the shutter . Seconds later , when the light had vanished and the mountain returned to a brooding silhouette , my hiking partner finally had his camera in hand-but had to ask for a copy of my picture . THE LESSON : Be prepared for fleeting moments of wilderness beauty . Keep your camera close at hand and prepped to shoot . John Harlin , Northwest Editor 6 BUSHWHACKING BLISS THE MOMENT : I was about 12 years old , still growing into my first pack and happy to follow trails wherever they led . Then a family friend , Rick , said he 'd take us to a " secret " lake with glorious views and huge trout . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't exactly know the way . We ambled along a beautiful stream , clawed through brush , backtracked , scrambled up talus slopes , detoured around spectacular pour-offs , backtracked again , admired a wildflower-fitted gully . And that was all before lunch . We eventually located the lake , but the day 's real find was the adventure of blazing our own way . THE LESSON : Learn to read the landscape , not just trail signs , and you 'll never lack for a private path to crowd-free wilderness adventure . Dennis Lewon , Assistant Equipment Editor 7 PILLOW TALK THE MOMENT : With my head resting on a stuff sack full of stinky clothes and my body stretched out on a thin sleeping pad , I used to rejoice if I slept 2 hours straight in the backcountry . Then a friend gave me a small-but-puffy pack pillow . I was n't crazy about the extra weight , but I decided to give decadence a try . That night in New York 's Catskills , despite a snoring tentmate , I slept like Rip van Winkle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflatable sleeping pad . THE LESSON : A few extra ounces in your sleep system can pay off in much-needed rest and more pep in your step . If you want to tighten your load , sacrifice that 800page novel you used to read when you could n't sleep . Gina DeMillo , Associate Editor 8 FAT , DRINK , AND HIKE MERRY THE MOMENT : Nearing the top of a 2,000-foot climb out of North Carolina 's Linville Gorge , I could feel my body honking . I 'd felt fit and energized at the start , so I had n't stopped to eat or drink . As I washed down handfuls of gorp with Gatorade , I flashed back to a half marathon I 'd recently run , and it all became clear . Water stations every mile ! Of course . If I 'd paused every 500 feet for refreshments , I would n't be half-dead and horizontal . THE LESSON : Prime your pump with regular snacks and sips of water . On big hills , create your own aid stations by stopping to rest and refuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAY THE PRICE THE MOMENT : Forty days earlier , the ski plane had dropped me onto the flooded Arctic permafrost . Ever since , I 'd been alone , paddling and exploring the vast barrens of Alaska 's Colville River , Sometimes I got scared thinking of all the things that could go wrong . I remembered a vastly simpler trip back home where I so lost myself in the scenery that I literally got lost . To steady my nerves in Alaska-and prevent accidents-I buried myself in daily chores : patching dry bags , overhauling the stove , and checking supplies . The work kept me safe and sane amid some of the most remote wilderness in North America . Sometimes I wondered why everything was going so well . And then it hit me : I was paying attention . THE LESSON : It 's carelessness , not wilderness , that gets you in trouble . If you prepare well , move carefully , and pay attention , you can avoid the biggest hazard out there : yourself . Steve Howe , Rocky Mountain Editor 10 THE GOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the mover was nowhere to be seen . But I needed to hike . So I borrowed a friend 's Boy Scout sleeping bag and the external frame pack he 'd inherited from his grandpa . Then I left the trailhead in the dark , hoping no one would see my old-fashioned gear . You know what ? It did n't matter . On that trip , the bag kept me as warm as my expensive down mummy . And though I 've worn more comfortable packs , grandpa 's hauled just fine . THE LESSON : Good gear can make hiking safer and more comfortable , but the pleasure of a wilderness journey is always there , no matter what your gear 's quality . J. Rennicke 10 SNEAKY WAYS TO CARRY LESS AND KICK BACK MORE No pain no gain ? We beg to differ . Whoever coined that unfortunate saying never strolled into a sublime alpine camp toting a light load ( oops , how did my food bag get into your pack ? ) just as dinner was being served ( sorry , am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed to make your camping experience more comfortable ... unless your the ethical type , that is . Then you 'll just learn which tricks to watch out for . Carry fresh fruits and vegetables . Perishable food is the first to get eaten , so your load quickly shrinks . A corollary Volunteer to carry group food rather than group gear . The food gets lighter every day . Burn dinner Offer to cook the first meal . then scorch it . Your hiking partners wo n't let you cook again Sneak gear into your partner 's pack . At the trailhead or when breaking camp in the morning slip a few items from your pack into your buddy 's . If caught . say , " Oh . thought this was yours . " Volunteer for your favorite camp chores . You 'll get stuck with something ( probably ) , so claim the pleasant tasks ( like hunting for firewood ) before someone else does . Take up photography . When others are setting up camp , you 'll be off shooting the sunset or stalking the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your companions . Carry the tent poles and stakes . Sounds like a fair deal , but you wo n't have to lug the extra water weight when the canopy and rainfly absorb rain or condensation . Go light . Two things happen when you carry a tiny pack : 1-You quickly run out of room for group gear , and 2-Everyone offers you food , assuming you must be starving . Complain about your sore knees and back . Your companions will take pity and offer to carry some of your load . Feign sickness . Cough , sneeze , and talk about your loose stools . Nobody will let you cook , clean dishes , or filter water . Watch the gas . Helpfully dig out your fuel bottle so the cook can get dinner started . Afterward , leave the stove hooked up so your gas burns at breakfast , too . If someone beats you to the punch , insist on topping off his bottle for the sake of maximum fuel efficiency . <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
