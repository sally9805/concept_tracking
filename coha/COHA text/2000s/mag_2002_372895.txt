When George W. Bush learned that the nation 's immigration service had approved the student visas of two Sept. 11 hijackers six months after their attack , he was , by his own description , " plenty hot . " In the past few weeks , the FBI has suffered even more spectacular embarrassments  --  missed signals that pointed to the coming attack , accusations of a cover-up , the public airing of infighting  --  yet the needle on Bush 's thermostat has barely fluttered . Instead , he mildly conceded that " the FBI was an organization full of fine people that loved America " but " it needed to change . " Even in private , advisers say , Bush has kept his cool amid revelations that have led some to call for Director Robert Mueller 's head . As Bob Dole used to wonder , " Where 's the outrage ? " <P> Not at the White House , where Bush , aides claim , is n't interested in placing blame . " The President is focused on how we prevent a future attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't undo history . " He and others add that Mueller became FBI chief just a week before the hit . But keeping calm on the sidelines serves another presidential purpose . Ever since it leaked that Bush had been briefed in August on the possibility that al-Qaeda might employ hijacking to advance its terrorist aims , the White House has carefully tried to insulate the President from suggestions that the FBI 's failures were his failures as well . Better to keep him out of the story , the thinking goes , and direct attention  --  and blame  --  toward the bureau . <P> So the White House was content to watch last week as searchlights shone on FBI headquarters . Mueller played his best Janet ( " The buck stops with me " ) Reno , admitting to " misstatements " about what the FBI knew before 9/11 and announcing plans to reorganize the sclerotic bureau into a nimble , terrorist-foiling machine . Was the White House concerned that Mueller may have gone too far ? " Our goal was to position him as the reformer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words reform and reformer kept tripping off the lips of Administration spinners as they refuted charges  --  from FBI whistle-blower Coleen Rowley as well as from senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill  --  that Mueller has been more focused on protecting the bureau than fixing it . <P> So far , the White House strategy of distancing the President from FBI problems seems to be working . Though the rash of disclosures about missed clues before Sept. 11 and the warnings about future attacks have soured the public view of the war 's progress , Bush has not suffered . Last week a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 41% of Americans believe the U.S. is winning the war on terror , down from 66% in January . Yet 77% of Americans say they approve of Bush 's job as Commander in Chief . As long as new disclosures are limited , the White House does not see FBI troubles becoming an issue for its party in the 2002 campaign .
