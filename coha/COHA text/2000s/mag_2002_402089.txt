We asked writer Judy Waytiuk and researcher Steve Brearton to give medicare a thorough examination . They poked . They prodded . They made the experts stick out their tongues and say argh . Now brace yourself for the diagnosis . Graph Not Transcribed In Toronto , a six-year-old boy with autism is denied treatment that costs up to $63,000 a year  --  treatment he would receive if he were a British Columbian . In Edmonton , the government announces a hike in health care premiums of up to 40 percent  --  premiums that can cost an average family $1,200 a year . And our premiers continue to air their grievances and lobby the feds . But health care goes far beyond hospitals , doctors and drugs , which is often what gets debated when politicians meet to discuss medicare . Poverty , unhealthy lifestyles and geography are major influences . Today 's Parent set out to examine as many of these factors as possible , using the most reliable data available ( see " How the Numbers Add Up , " p. 58 ) . One trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practitioners or family doctors  --  the first , most consistent health contacts we have  --  are in increasingly short supply . The country is lacking 3,000 GPs now , and the College of Family Physicians of Canada expects that number to double within this decade . Something else is clear : British Columbia is doing the best job . The province ties with Quebec for highest number of GPs ( 105 per 100,000 people ) , and has the lowest mortality rate and lowest asthma hospitalization rates . Family doctor Heidi Oetter , president of the BC Medical Association , also gives her province high marks for putting physical education specialists in all school districts , and phys. ed teachers in every school . And , she adds , " We 've had some well-integrated support services . " Those services were instituted more than a decade ago by governments , notes Bob Smith , the province 's director of public health protection , that emphasized " nutrition , dental health , injury prevention , tobacco reduction , home care nursing , those kinds of things . Eight years from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're cutting a lot of services . " In fact , things may change more quickly than that with recent dramatic slashing of provincial programs in BC  --  the most draconian government budget cuts instituted in Canada . Table Overall Ranking //  --  1 . British Columbia  --  2 . Quebec  --  3 . Prince Edward Island  --  4 . Nova Scotia  --  5 . Ontario  --  6 . New Brunswick  --  7 . Alberta  --  8 . Manitoba  --  9 . Newfoundland  --  10 . Saskatchewan Oetter adds that BC 's population tends to be more affluent and live healthier lifestyles  --  more exercise , better nutrition  --  than the rest of Canada . British Columbians smoke less than anyone else in Canada , for example . Still , all is not perfect in Lotusland . Despite being the only province with a complete surgical waiting list registry ( Saskatchewan , with the worst waiting lists , is developing one now ) , BC also has the third-longest wait for treatment referrals . Quebec took the number two spot in our ranking with the third-lowest under-five mortality rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories . The two provinces also do better in areas like home care for children with disabilities and chronic illnesses . " My sense is that BC is the best in Canada , and next would probably be Quebec , " says Patricia McKeever , a professor at the University of Toronto 's faculty of nursing . " In BC there is a greater sensitivity to children , and there 's more of a welfare ethos . In Quebec , they have very generous policies with regard to children . I would still say , though , that neither province is where it should be . " Table Selected Rankings From Our Survey //  --  Here 's a look at how each province ranked in six of our survey categories . In all cases , a rank of 1 indicates the healthiest in Canada , and 10 indicates the worst ( some ranks are duplicated because of ties ) .

Something 's awry here  --  but it 's not necessarily the health care system . " It 's not that the government is n't trying , " says family physician Bev Karras , president of the Saskatchewan Medical Association . One of Canada 's poorer provinces , Saskatchewan must cope with the oldest population in Canada , vast rural and remote areas and , along with Manitoba , the highest percentage of aboriginal people among the provinces ( 14 percent each ) . Saskatchewan 's infant mortality rate has " always been higher than average , but the gap is narrowing , " says that province 's chief medical health officer , David Butler-Jones . " The issue is economic disparity , primarily . If you look outside the aboriginal population , our rate of infant mortality is really no different from the rest of Canada . " As for Saskatchewan 's waiting lists , he says , " If you are sick and you 've got a very serious disease , then you are seen and you are cared for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people in Saskatchewan are the healthiest in the country , " backing up his claim by pointing to the province 's premature mortality rate of 39.4 percent , second-lowest in the country and just a shade behind PEI 's . The bottom line for Butler-Jones is the same as it is everywhere else in Canada . " So often we make the assumption these issues are just about access to health care , and it 's not simply that , " he says , echoing all the other experts . " It has a lot to do with social and economic conditions , " and these do n't fall directly within our health care systems ' control . But they must ultimately be dealt with by our beleaguered doctors , nurses , hospitals and health care workers . " Poor people end up with poorer health , " is how health services researcher Brian Hutchison , acting director of the Hamilton-based Centre for Health Economics and Policy , sums it up . " Where resources are tight , people who are the least educated and least financially well off will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote areas also have less access . " I do outreach to Dawson Creek , and I know very well that the health care out there is not as good as it is down here , " says Derryck Smith , head of child psychiatry at the Women 's and Children 's Health Centre in Vancouver . " Like most social services , the farther away you are from urban centres , the less available are services of all kinds . " Many other experts , including the Canadian Paediatric Society , agree that rural and remote areas have greater health problems . ( The situation is particularly bleak in the North ; see " Northern Exposure . " ) But only Manitoba has done a detailed population health study that examines regional disparities , and researcher Pat Martens says its results do n't support that assumption . " There is a whole range of factors involved , " she cautions . Still , the study did find that childhood injury mortality rates are higher in rural and remote areas : For kids in northern Manitoba , injury mortality rates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 . In the rural south of the province , the number is 27 . Generally , Brian Hutchison believes Canada 's system " serves most of us pretty well , at a pretty reasonable cost , " but that ours is " not a good health system for poor and aboriginal people . " Others make the same argument for children with disabilities and critical illnesses ( see " A System With Disabilities , " p. 62 ) . Derryck Smith is a harsher critic  --  even though he lives in our top-ranked province . " Health care in general is in very serious trouble in this country , " he declares . " No one else has emulated our health care system in the world , and nobody would particularly want to . " " Health care in general is in very serious trouble in this country .
