<p> WHY does health care for the average Medicare patient cost nearly twice as much a year in New Jersey , at $8,076 , as it does in Hawaii , at $4,529 ? <p> The differences are one example of perplexing geographic variations in medical expenses and quality . And in a study that has important implications for the nation 's $2 trillion health care tab , researchers have found that more intensive and expensive care does not necessarily mean better outcomes . In fact , the opposite may be true . <p> The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care , a research group that studies variations and costs in medical care , sums it up like this : Geography is destiny . It means that your chances of undergoing certain surgical procedures , visiting the doctor often or even dying in a hospital or at home are related to where you live . <p> For example , Medicare patients living in Rhode Island undergo knee replacements at a rate of 5 in 1,000 people . In Nebraska , the number rises to 10 in 1,000 . Female Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven times the chance of having a mastectomy in South Dakota , where the rate is 2 in 1,000 , as they do in Vermont , where the rate is .3 in 1,000 . <p> In another comparison , the Dartmouth group , a project of the college 's medical school , analyzed the costs and type of care patients receive in their last six months of life . Those in Oregon spend an average of eight days in the hospital while those in New York spend 35 days . In Oregon , the patient is seen by an average of 14 doctors during that period . In New York , 35 doctors see the patient . <p> In the last two years of life , the average Oregon patient costs $25,500 , and the New York patient , $38,300 . <p> Such differences can not be explained by rates of illness or cost-of-living deviations . In some cases , drastic variations in Medicare treatment and costs occur even within states . There are almost twice as many hip replacements in Palo Alto as there are in San Francisco , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic medical centers . <p> Some differences involve choices . Does a patient prefer to live with the pain and inconvenience of a bad knee , or undergo a knee replacement ? It depends on personal preference and the advice that doctors give about risks versus rewards . Does a woman with breast cancer elect mastectomy or lumpectomy ? <p> But much of the deviation appears to be caused by what experts call " supply sensitive care , " meaning the number of doctor visits and hospitalizations expand to the system 's capacity . Higher-spending areas have more hospital beds per person and more highly specialized physicians . <p> In communities with surplus hospital beds , research shows , patients do not necessarily get more elective surgery , but they have more hospital stays , more frequent doctor 's visits and are more likely to be referred to specialists . <p> Dr. Elliott S. Fisher , who studies health care economics and is a member of the Dartmouth research group , said that part of the problem was the way doctors and hospitals were paid . <p> " In a payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capacity you have , whether it 's the number of specialists or the number of intensive care beds or the M.R.I. scanner , has to stay fully occupied because they bought them already and they have to keep paying for them , " Dr. Fisher said in a telephone interview . <p> He told a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission panel last year : " If you 're lying down and spending time in the hospital and seeing more specialists , you also get more tests and minor procedures because that 's what we do when you 're in there . " <p> Paradoxically , the Dartmouth research , which confirms some similar studies , shows that patients in high-cost areas are not necessarily getting better care . Dr. Fisher said that he and his colleagues found higher mortality rates in higher-spending regions . <p> " When physicians describe the quality of care , they say the quality of care is worse in the higher-spending regions , " Dr. Fisher told the panel . <p> Among disturbing findings , Dr. Fisher said , are that tremendous gains in heart attack survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-spending regions . <p> One reason is that the risks of being hospitalized , including infections and medical errors , can outweigh the benefits . But the adage about " too many cooks " could also play a role . <p> " What we hypothesize is happening is that as the complexity of the system increases , it becomes less and less clear who is the responsible physician , " Dr. Fisher said . <p> Extra care without better outcomes translates into waste in the health care system . Some experts say that waste accounts for as much as if not more than 30 percent of the national spending on health care . Such spending now totals 16 percent of the gross domestic product . <p> Dr. Fisher said that the spending differences from one area to another are mostly related to discretionary decisions in gray areas , like uncertainty about the proper treatment . <p> The Dartmouth group 's leader , Dr. John E. Wennberg , began studying such variations in the 1970s while directing a federally financed program in Vermont that analyzed services in state hospitals . He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostatectomies  --  varied a lot from town to town . <p> In Morrisville , for example , Dr. Wennberg found that 63 percent of children under 16 had undergone a tonsillectomy , compared with 7 percent 70 miles away in Middlebury . He found that five doctors in Morrisville were responsible for the deviation . While antibiotics were widely used to treat infections elsewhere , the Morrisville doctors were relying on old methods . <p> The group 's Web site , dartmouthatlas.org , contains detailed analysis of procedures paid for by Medicare nationwide , as well as interactive graphs . People can use the site to find rates of spending and procedures at their local hospitals . <p> What is the solution to these problems ? One answer involves an increase in primary-care doctors . Research indicates that costs go up and quality declines with increased physician specialization . Dr. Fisher notes that New Jersey , the highest-cost state , has a specialty-oriented approach . He thinks coordination could be the answer . <p> " I really do believe strongly that we need to foster the development of large physician groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality and cost of care , " he said . " Most of the serious deficiencies in the U.S. health care system are in lack of coordination and fragmentation . " <p> Policy makers are seeking ways to increase financial incentives for becoming a family doctor , internist or pediatrician , possibly by raising the payments doctors receive for evaluating and managing patients or creating a new reimbursement category for coordinating care . <p> The average family physician nationwide currently makes $126,000 a year , while the average specialist earns $297,000 a year . <p> " If you can be a dermatologist and have no night calls and make an average of $290,000 a year , then why go into family medicine ? " asked Dr. John G. Scott , an assistant professor of family medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School . <p> Dr. Scott sums up the situation in New Jersey with a personal anecdote . When he moved there from Arkansas and told an acquaintance he was a family doctor , she responded , " We do n't have those @ @ @ @ @ @ @
