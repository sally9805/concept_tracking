<p> For almost a decade , Denver composer Stephen Nye and his New York collaborator have been waiting for an opportune time to resurrect their big-voiced musical , ' The Sword and the Crown . ' <p> Now , thanks in part to the success of movies such as ' Shakespeare in Love ' and ' Elizabeth , ' they believe audiences are primed to embrace the tale of medieval passion and pageantry they first brought to the stage as a summer theater production in Denver in 1990 . <p> ' It 's huge , ebullient , big-voiced , dramatic singing , as opposed to most contemporary musical theater , which is about dysfunctional families saying clever things , ' said Nye , who wrote music and lyrics for the show . <p> ' People are hungry for an alternative , ' agreed co-creator Michael Martorano , who conceived the story . ' When everything seems to be written for angst-ridden teenagers and something comes along with an adult theme , it 's going to be a success . ' <p> Actors reunited <p> In hopes of proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three singers who originated the principal roles in ' The Sword and the Crown ' - as well as the original director , David G. Armstrong of New York - and arranged a couple of repeat performances of excerpts from the show this weekend . <p> The concerts , featuring 13 of the score 's 34 songs , will be at 7:30 p.m . Friday and Saturday in the appropriately gothic Dagwell Hall at St. John 's Episcopal Cathedral , 1313 Clarkson St. Tickets are $ 20 per person , including refreshments and a ' talk back ' session afterward with the director , creators and actors . Reservations are required ; call 303-831-8320 or visit the Web site at **27;91;TOOLONG . <p> The short-term goal of the presentations , Nye said , is to raise at least part of the $ 70,000 needed to move to the next level of development - getting the music arranged for orchestra and producing a studio recording of selections that ' we can use as a calling card ' in pitching the project to producers in New York and London . <p> Once upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process could have been accomplished merely by mailing out copies of the script , the score and a cassette tape with piano accompaniment . But today , new musicals are typically marketed with 30-minute ' concept CDs , ' recorded in four-day sessions with professional musicians and singers . <p> Singing around the piano <p> The ultimate goal , of course , is much more ambitious - to find a deep-pockets sponsor willing to commit as much as $ 8 million to take the play to the Great White Way , perhaps as soon as two or three years from now , once the production has been refined in regional theaters such as the Starlight in St. Louis or the Guthrie in Minneapolis . <p> At the moment , though , the project is still at the stand-around-the-piano stage . Indeed , Nye intends to rehearse this weekend 's program from the keyboard of the Kawai baby grand in his Capitol Hill duplex , where the three singers are due to meet today for the first time since the musical ended its initial three-week run as a workshop production at Metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Les Mis ' <p> In essence , ' The Sword and the Crown ' is a story of love , jealousy , treachery and male bonding . Touted as a cross between ' Camelot ' and ' Les Miserables , ' it is based on the lives of real characters from English history - Prince Hal , the rebellious youth who became the legendary King Henry V in the early 1400s ; his mentor and later foe , Harry Percy , the knight known as Hotspur ; and Hotspur 's wife , Lady Elizabeth Mortimer . <p> The workshop version was an elaborate production that included a battle with broadswords and crossbows , a victory ball and a wedding ; involved a company of roughly 30 soldiers , noblemen and ladies-in-waiting ; and called for the use of three pianos and a synthesizer for accompaniment . <p> This weekend 's program , bare-bones by comparison , will feature Nye at the keyboard with his onetime proteges : <p> Brad Kindall as Hal . A tenor who in 1990 was getting his master 's degree at the National Theater Conservatory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program for a large church . <p> Patrick Sawyer as Hotspur . A baritone who later became director of a dinner theater in Fort Collins , he is in Denver preparing for a production of ' 1776 ' at Littleton Town Hall . <p> Pamela Mahon as Elizabeth . Studying for her master 's degree in voice at the University of Colorado 10 years ago , she now sings with the Portland Opera in Oregon . <p> ' They all jumped at the opportunity to come back and sing music that was written for them , ' said Nye , who has been a composer , choreographer , organist , choir director and vocal music teacher in Denver since the early 1970s . He is drama director at the Denver School of the Arts . <p> Much musical training <p> Also a talented dancer , the 49-year-old artist performed with the Colorado Ballet for five years and , in an episode he hates to be reminded of , appeared on Dick Clark 's ' American Bandstand ' in the ' 60s when he was a teenager growing up in Philadelphia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while training as an actor in England , said he has wanted to see it dramatized ever since Broadway kingmaker Hal Prince optioned it as a stage play in the mid- ' 80s . Prince later decided that ' a show of this scope and passion ' would work better as a musical . <p> The collaboration that led to the Denver show began after Martorano attended a New York production of ' Favorite Night , ' a Christmas opera Nye wrote while earning his doctorate in musical theater at New York University . <p> ' I have a very simple test for music . If I get a chill down my spine , I know it 's good . And that 's what happened when I heard Stephen 's music , ' said Martorano , who has spent time sharpening his skills as a playwright , most recently by translating the plays that were the basis for the Mozart operas ' The Marriage of Figaro ' and ' The Barber of Seville . ' <p> He also has recently finished a light-hearted screenplay set in the operatic arena . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ' Big , ' you 'll like this , ' Martorano said . <p> Less music , more dialogue <p> Armstrong , who will introduce the performances this weekend , has become one of the country 's most sought-after musical-theater directors and is working on a new production based on the notebooks left by the late Jonathan Larson , creator of the hit musical ' Rent . ' <p> Originally , ' The Sword and the Crown ' was designed to be ' sung through ' - that is , performed without talking , much in the style of ' Les Miserables ' ( which Nye saw 37 times while writing the show ) . But in the interest of developing the characters and moving the plot along , the composer has taken the music out of some passages and added some spoken dialogue . <p> ' Most of the score is still intact , ' said Nye , ' but I 've rewritten the first 20 minutes of the show ( i.e. replaced five songs with four new ones ) because it took a long time to get going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handwritten music stuffed into loose-leaf notebooks , contains at least one selection that has remained untouched - the title song , a ' hugely joyous ' first-act number in which Hal and Hotspur resolve their initial differences and pledge respect to one another . <p> ' It was the first song I wrote for this show , ' Nye said , ' and not a word or a note has been changed since I wrote it .
