Willy <p> Once a year , my senile aunt tries to kill me . <p> Her name is Mavis and she 's really my great-aunt , my grandmother 's sister . And although she may not be trying to murder me , it darn near works every September . These days Mavis remembers very little besides names and birthdays , so every year for the last six years , she 's sent me the same card : on the outside , the words " Happy 30th Birthday , " and on the inside , " Embrace the Zero . " <p> I can not begin to express the terror this simple act of kindness evokes in me . <p> At fourteen years of age , someone had to die for me to live . I felt guilty before my surgery and have felt that way every day since . Several days after they opened my chest , removed my diseased heart , and installed its donated replacement , I overheard a conversation between the surgeon and my mom . My mom was terrified the new heart would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the surgeon said , " William 's procedure went swimmingly well . If we 're lucky , we just added another decade and a half to his life . " <p> I often picture the ticking in my chest as an old-fashioned alarm clock , wrapped in pink pumping flesh and set for some unknown hour in the not too distant future . According to the Internet , the average life expectancy of transplant survivors is eleven very short years . I was never very good at math , but I believe my surgeon 's estimate puts my expiration date at about age thirty . <p> Yesterday I turned twenty-nine . <p> I spent the better part of a decade trying to figure out who to blame . Was it God for knitting together such a weak heart in my mother 's womb ? My mother for smoking through two out of three trimesters ? My father for driving my mother to the nasty habit in the first place ? The donor for not eating more vegetables and shunning elevators and Twinkies ? At some point I decided to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead I turned my attention to my list , officially titled : " Things to Do before I Die . " It 's not a bad list . It just needs one more item : " Stop wallowing and actually do something about the list before you die . " <p> When I ca n't bear to look at Aunt Mavis 's card any longer , I push back from the kitchen table , causing frothy espresso to lip over the edge of my World 's Worst Teacher mug , which now appears to be shedding dirty tears in mourning . <p> I enter my bedroom and rummage through my underwear drawer till I find my grandfather 's lockbox . Then I dump this year 's card inside with the rest of Aunt Mavis 's identical birthday wishes . <p> Before I close the lid I catch a glimpse of my first novel . It 's a shiny library copy of The Handyman , the first in my series of detective novels about Ralph I. Handy ( my unlucky one-eyed , one-handed repairman-cum-sleuth ) . The cover reveals the sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver protruding like a vacuum cleaner attachment from where the hand is supposed to be . <p> I 've scrawled my to-do list on the dedication page , in pencil under the words : " For Walter , my brother , mentor , and friend . I miss you now more than I ever thought I could . " My brother had few talents - namely , finding trouble , accidentally breaking the hearts of gorgeous women , and stoking the unshakable devotion of his kid brother . Legend has it that by the time he was four , my parents swore off ever having another child . I appeared in my first ( and only ) ultrasound eight years later . By then my parents were ready to retire from the child-rearing business altogether . <p> I remember the day I came up with my list . I was just young enough and dumb enough to think that the act of jotting down a few goals would somehow magically produce the internal fortitude necessary to accomplish them . I study it now , mentally crossing off the few items I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , writing my " serious " novel , riding in a helicopter ) and scoffing at the rest . One item , scratched out and rewritten numerous times , makes me groan aloud . " Fall in love ... for real this time . " <p> Then it dawns on me . What good is a list when I have no real intention of following through ? It 's like a giant Post-It note reminder of my most glaring inadequacies . <p> I snap the book shut , grab my stack of birthday cards , carry them all to the kitchen , and toss them in the sink . I should have done this years ago . I root around in the junk drawer , finding every candle that Lucy left behind but not a single match . Then I remember my grandfather 's pipe rack . They 're lined up , bowls down , like prehistoric golf clubs , each one eliciting its own quiet memory . I pause to inhale the aroma of wet tobacco , then snatch my grandfather 's favorite flip-top lighter and hurry back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sacrifice . I hold the copy of my novel aloft , then flick the lighter open . I spin the flint wheel once , twice , then it ignites . My thumb goes numb as I touch the flame to the edge of the dangling book cover and wait . <p> Nothing . <p> Yellow tendrils flirt with the edge but refuse to catch . I let the pages flutter , hoping the resulting breeze will fan the flame . Then my thumb starts to burn and I have to let go of the lighter . <p> I stare at the book , stupidly , wondering if it 's been treated with some secret flame retardant to prevent libraries from burning down . I gather up my stack of birthday cards and flick the lighter into action again , holding the edge of Mavis 's death notice to the flame . <p> It catches . I alternate my gaze between the growing flame and my demented fun house grin reflected in the belly of my teakettle . <p> That 's when the smoke detector goes off . A shrill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lighter and the burning card , then grip the edge of the sink with both hands . I 'm not typically one for omens , but I decide now to do something else about my list . <p> * * * <p> It took the better part of an hour - and a dozen hands of solitaire - for the turbulent pounding in my chest to subside . The only casualties of my botched arson attempt appear to be one blistered fingertip and a relentless tingling sensation along the length of my scar . <p> I place the nine of spades on the ten of diamonds , then resume turning cards over and ignore the sound of my telephone ringing . After a long beep , I hear the habitual throat clearing of my literary agent . His voice sounds like a drowsy Muppet , his bored monotone more despairing than normal , if that 's even possible . <p> " William ... " ( Sigh . ) " We need to talk ... " ( Elongated nasal breathing . ) " Soon ... " ( Bigger sigh . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Medium sigh , but with feeling . ) " I have news . " <p> The word news is bloated with meaning , conjuring the image of a grim-faced soap opera doctor - I 'm sorry , Mr. Finneran . We did everything we could ... <p> I asked him once if he was getting enough sleep . He simply said , " The world ... is too giddy for my tastes . " <p> " And you think your gloomy outlook is somehow going to stem that particular epidemic ? " <p> " I 'm no hero , Willy . I 'm just doing my part . " <p> Despite Stan 's perpetual grogginess , he 's a real animal when it comes to business dealings . This proved invaluable when my books were actually selling . But I have n't heard from Stan in months , not since the last puny royalty check arrived . He did n't even bother with a Christmas card this year . <p> I take another sip of espresso - a vile beverage - and place a red jack on a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's as if Lucy is staring right back at me . Years ago I took the real aces out of my deck and replaced them with the following : <p> An index card with Doug 's cell number on it - Clubs , because we used to play nightclubs . <p> A photograph of Lucy celebrating our first anniversary - Hearts , for obvious reasons . <p> A severely cropped greeting card I found tucked between the pages of Song of Solomon in Lucy 's Bible - Spades , for digging graves . <p> The receipt for Lucy 's espresso machine - Diamonds , still not sure why . <p> Lucy 's been gone almost five years now , and what I hate more than the loneliness is the fact that I 've lost her scent . I used to stand in our closet and sniff the sleeves of her shirts and the necklines of her best dresses . But it 's her skin I miss most - the sight of it , the warm touch , and especially the smell . <p> One night I got the bright idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balled-up sheets . I just knew I could n't suffer another night of waking up at two in the morning and weeping at the sight of the empty spot beside me . She did n't own any wigs so I resorted to a volleyball and a new mop I found in the garage . It did n't have to be perfect , just passable , since Lucy always slept with her head under a pillow . I washed the mop with Lucy 's shampoo , then doused it with perfume and lotion and tucked it between the covers . With the lights on , my handiwork resembled a Lucy scarecrow . I still woke up at two a.m. , but the only difference was my screaming in fright before the sobbing started up . <p> I 've gone thirty seconds without a play when my homemade ace of spades appears . I place it in the first foundations position and pause to study it . The card was from a guy named Alvin . On the outside it said , Thinking of you . Folded inside was a printed version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin and my wife . He used words like bliss and affair and love . She called it an " emotional hiccup " that could have led to a " physical disaster " that should be " filed under Things Best Forgotten . " This last bit should make me feel better , but it does n't . Every time I read it I feel my borrowed heart nudge sideways a fraction of an inch , like when a stranger squeezes into the seat next to you on the subway . <p> The phone rings . I ignore it and perform an illegal search for a black three . A few moments later the answering machine clicks on in the bedroom . I crane one ear toward the familiar voice . It 's Alistair " the Dean " Langstrom , my boss , and he does n't sound pleased . He rarely does though . My latest infraction , it seems , was my homogeneous approach to grading students . I do have a vague memory of giving my entire freshman comp class A-minuses . <p> Three grimacing swallows later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Wal-Mart to pick up more espresso mix . That 's when Doug shows up , letting himself in with the key I keep hidden in plain view on my front porch . He 's a big man , not fat so much as thick , bulging like a pincushion . His chubby cheeks and enormous hands make him look like a giant toddler . Once inside , he tosses a giant stack of mail in the middle of my cards and croons , " Avon calling ! " <p> " I thought you saved that prissy burlesque routine for the dean , who , by the way , may have just fired me . " <p> " Hah . Not on my watch . " Doug plants his fists on his thick hips like an effeminate superhero ; a move his wife finds adorable , yet strikes mortal fear in our boss . <p> When Dean Langstrom inherited the current Edwards University English Department he was more than a little dismayed to find a hack genre writer ( me ) and an outspoken born-again homosexual ( Doug ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only trigger Doug 's unbridled social activism . He once staged a sit-in to protest the Girl Scouts preying on the obese and elderly when hawking their chocolate devil wafers . <p> So with cries of discrimination only a breath away , Langstrom employs alternating strategies of either shaming me or bullying me into resigning . He scrutinizes my work , talks down to me , and peppers me with trivial questions about obscure literary figures at faculty meetings . <p> Doug , however , is tenured , both as a professor and friend . The only thing he loves more than his wife is Jesus . He claims to have undergone a period of sexual dis orientation in college , which ended on a blind date with Maggie , another sojourner of nebulous sexuality . They made a pact , more spiritual than carnal , and the result was a modern day arranged marriage , complete with the first of their two-point-six kids on the way . <p> " So , " I say . " How 's Maggie ? " <p> " Fat and grumpy and more beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Doug refers to his wife 's pregnancy in plural possessive , owning inasmuch as possible his share of the pain and suffering . I have to admit , he does an admirable job . In fact , their love is so complete and endearing and sickeningly idyllic , it depresses everyone in its soupy green wake . <p> " Wo n't the arrival of your bouncing baby boy tip Langstrom off to your rampant straightness ? " <p> " Nah , it 'll confound him more . But enough chit-chat . Why did n't you answer your phone ? " <p> " I do n't know . I 'm busy . " <p> " Should I check the tub ? " <p> I look up , blinking . The last time he dropped in on me I was filling the bathtub with all things Lucy , not just clothes and perfumes and shampoos , but also her hair dryer , laptop , and espresso maker - all plugged in through a network of extension cords . He assumed , of course , I was preparing a place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really doing . <p> " What 's this ? " he says , pointing to the stacks of paper opposite my array of playing cards . <p> " Oh , that . Just some schoolwork . " <p> Doug walks to the end of the table for a closer look . I resist the urge to crawl under my chair . He squints at the stacks , angling his big head for closer inspection . His eyes alternate between a stack of mail and a pile of assigned short fiction I was supposed to grade and return to my fall semester students . In a fit of frustration I guess I reversed the process . <p> " You gave your electric bill a C-minus ? " <p> " Well , look at it . The sentence variety is atrocious . What few verbs that appear are either passive or soulless . And I find the omniscient voice condescending , intrusive , and blatantly authoritative . " <p> " No argument here . " Doug studies the stack of papers I was grading , a grim look clouding his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write personal checks to your students ? " <p> " Compare the prose , Doug . You tell me who 's more deserving . " <p> " Look , I 'm not here to hold your hand or interrupt your wallowing . I need a favor . " <p> We both know I owe him dozens . So I do the mature thing and ignore him , sorting my new mail into piles : junk mail , bills , and personal correspondence . The stack of bills is smaller than the junk mail , but much more daunting . <p> " I 'm not taking your sister out . " <p> " Fair enough . " <p> " Or Maggie 's sister . " <p> " She 'll be devastated . " <p> " Or any pathetic souls from your church . " <p> " You do realize you 're wearing pajamas and a pair of galoshes ? " <p> " Shut up . " <p> " What is it this time , Will ? Lucy ? Your secondhand ticker ? Writer 's block ? " <p> I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy ? This nasty espresso coating my tongue ? <p> Finally I say , " I thought you needed a favor . " <p> " What I need is a guitar player for Saturday night . " <p> Doug is a remarkable writer who wants desperately to be a real musician . I 'm an alleged guitar prodigy bent on becoming a better writer . It 's these kind of odd intersections that define our friendship . I avoid conflict at all costs where Doug goes looking for it . I found Jesus early , then lost him whereas Doug found him late and makes sure everybody knows about it . <p> " I do n't know , " I say . " Jazz ? " <p> " Class reunion . " <p> I groan , but it 's mostly for show . <p> " Come on , Will . You need this . " <p> He 's probably right . For the first time in a long time , the thought of acting as a human jukebox to slobbering drunks actually appeals to me . <p> " I swear we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze in some Miles and Monk and Coltrane , maybe some Springsteen and Radiohead covers . And our patented Steely Dan medley . " <p> " Will Bernie the Bass Player be there ? " <p> " Yeah , but do n't sweat it . He does n't hate you anymore . " <p> " How do you know ? " <p> " I checked . " <p> " I do n't know , Doug . " <p> " Absolutely nothing in E-flat . I 'll see to it personally . " <p> " I ca n't believe I 'm - " <p> " Excellent . Rehearsal 's tomorrow night at eight . Dinner 's at six , if you think you can muster a shower between now and then . " <p> When Doug leaves , I stare at Lucy 's espresso machine , finger my scar through my pajama top , and wonder whatever happened to my toothbrush . <p> Ozena <p> Sometimes , if I squint just right , Reggie does n't look so bad . Especially when the fluorescent tubes in his office turn dark and flicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least not what I would call handsome . But the combination of my slitted gaze and the poor visibility make his acne scars dissipate , give his lazy hairline hope , and almost make the wattle of flab under his chin look like a pink ascot . <p> Almost . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
