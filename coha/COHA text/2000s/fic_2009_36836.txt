Wales , 1205 <p> Lord Alfred de Garleboine drew his dappled palfrey to a halt and peered through the water dripping from his coif . More rain fell from the pine trees beside the road and roused their heavy scent , while the verge was a mess of mud and running water . The drizzle rendered the sky a leaden gray and the rest of the landscape all mucky brown and dull green , the few exposed rocks like hunched little men trying to keep dry . <p> " God be praised , Llanpowell at last , " the middle-aged nobleman muttered as his mount refooted , its hooves churning up mud and pebbles . <p> From under the sodden hood of her cloak lined with fox fur , the young lady riding beside him followed his gaze to what was most definitely a castle and not just another stony outcropping in the south of Wales . <p> " My lord ! " <p> At the alarmed cry , Lord Alfred and Lady Roslynn de Werre looked back to see a heavy wooden cart stuck in a rut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , whipping the pair of draft horses and exhorting them to move . The horses snorted and pulled against the harness , but the wheel only sank deeper into the mud . <p> " Do n't just sit there like a lump of dung , " Lord Alfred ordered . " Get off and make those stupid beasts move ! " He pointed at six of the soldiers in the escort . " Stay with the wagon until it 's at the castle . The rest of us will continue . " <p> He shifted forward , then turned his steely , gray-eyed gaze onto Lady Roslynn . " Do you have any objection to leaving the wagon and going on to the castle , my lady ? " <p> " You are in command here , " she said with a beatific smile quite at odds with her internal turmoil . In truth , she would rather sit in a downpour than reach Llanpowell . " Are six men really necessary to guard the wagon when we 're so close to a nobleman 's castle , and in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any chances , " Lord Alfred replied before raising his hand and shouting for the rest of the cortege to move on . <p> Lady Roslynn suppressed a sigh . She did n't know why King John 's courtier had even bothered to ask her opinion . No doubt she should n't have bothered to answer . <p> The cortege continued on its way , the silence broken only by the falling rain , the jingle of accoutrements and soldiers ' chain mail , and the slap of hooves on the muddy road , every step bringing them closer to the castle of the lord of Llanpowell . Like the rocks , it seemed to be a natural feature of the landscape , exposed by time and the weather , not an edifice built by men . <p> This entire land was a rough contrast to Roslynn 's familiar Lincolnshire , where the flat fens stretched out for miles and the sky seemed endless . Here , there were hills and valleys , unexpected streams and wet bracken , scree and rocks . It was wild and untamed , strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . <p> Roslynn tried to stifle her dread as they neared the massive , bossed gates of thick oak . Whatever happened here , at least she was away from the king 's court , and the accommodations should be better than those they 'd had along the way . <p> A voice called out from the top of the barbican , speaking Norman French , albeit with a noticeable Welsh accent . " Who are you and what do you want at Llanpowell ? " <p> " I am Lord Alfred de Garleboine , on the king 's business , " the nobleman shouted back . <p> " The king 's business ? " the man on the wall walk repeated . " Which one ? " <p> " Is the man a simpleton ? " Lord Alfred muttered . He raised his voice . " John , by the grace of God , king of England , lord of Ireland , duke of Normandy and Aquitaine , count of Anjou . " <p> " Oh , the Plantagenet usurper who killed his nephew . " <p> Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true , this did n't bode well for a pleasant reception . <p> Three others , likewise bareheaded and wearing tunics , not chain mail , joined the man on the wall . <p> " What does John want ? " one of them called out . <p> " I will discuss that with your overlord , " Lord Alfred replied . <p> " Maybe you 've come to attack , " the first man called back . <p> Lord Alfred shifted impatiently in his ornately gilded saddle . " Do we look like aband of brigands ? " <p> " Ca n't be too sure these days , " the first man replied , apparently quite unconcerned by the nobleman 's growing impatience . " Seen some well-dressed Norman thieves in our time , we Welsh have . " <p> " Open these gates or the king shall hear of this , as well as your master ! " <p> It seemed that while the sentries were content to make sport of Norman visitors and their king , the lord of Llanpowell was not likely to be amused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . <p> What did that say about the lord of Llanpowell ? That he ruled by fear and harsh punishment ? Or was he simply not to be trifled with , but respected and obeyed ? <p> Whatever Madoc ap Gruffydd was like , there was no turning back or running away now . <p> " About bloody time . Insolent savages , " Lord Alfred growled as he flicked his gauntleted hand and gestured for their party to enter the castle . <p> Inside the outer wall was a large area , grassy and perhaps fifty yards long . Beyond the outer ward was the inner curtain wall , taller than the first , with another gate and a less elaborate gatehouse . <p> The inner gates were open , and a large wooden cart pulled by two thick-chested oxen rumbled toward them , followed by a group of twenty men , all wearing sword belts , with bows in their hands and quivers at their hips . They wore only leather tunics , breeches and boots , however , not chain mail or helmets . Their hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick beards . <p> Despite their attire , they must be part of the garrison , for they briskly formed two rows lining the road leading through the studded gate to the inner ward . <p> Lord Alfred 's jaw clenched . " The king shall hear of this insult , as well . " <p> " I believe it 's a guard of honor , my lord , " Ros-lynn quietly offered . " See how they 're arranged and how still they stand ? " <p> Lord Alfred 's only response to her observation was a noncommittal grunt . <p> Nevertheless , she was sure she was right , for the men remained where they were , staring stoically ahead , as the cortege continued into the courtyard . <p> Here the buildings were of several sizes and materials . Some were made of stone , with slate roofs . Others , like the stables , were half-timbered and wattle-and-daub , and some looked like little more than wooden lean-tos attached to any available wall . At least the yard was cobblestoned , so while there were several large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud . <p> Unfortunately , there were also several armed soldiers around the perimeter , standing beneath the eaves of buildings and watching them warily . <p> Before they could dismount , or a groom or stable boy arrived to take the horses , the door to the largest of the stone buildings flew open as if caught by a strong wind . A rotund , gray-haired fellow clad in a dusky green tunic , plain breeches and scuffed boots , with a dark brown woolen cloak thrown about his shoulders , came hurrying down the steps . Like the others , his hair was long and his beard full . Unlike the others , he wore only a simple belt , with no obvious weapon at his side , and a smile lit his round face . He also carried a huge mug in his hands , despite the continuing rain . <p> " Welcome , my lord , my lady ! " he called out in Welsh-tinged French , ignoring the puddles as he splashed his way toward them . " Welcome to Llan-powell ! Welcome to my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It felt as if a stone had settled into Roslynn 's stomach as she realized this must be Madoc ap Gruffydd , the lord of Llanpowell . <p> She had  --  foolishly , it now seemed  --  assumed the Bear of Brecon would be a younger man . She 'd also assumed he was called the Bear because of his fierceness in battle , not for wild gray hair that fell to his shoulders , his bushy beard or the size of his belly . <p> Or perhaps that name had been given to him in his youth . <p> The Welshman called out a few orders in his native tongue , and immediately grooms and boys appeared from the stables to take hold of their horses . <p> Apparently the lord of Llanpowell 's servants were as well trained as his soldiers , in spite of his jovial appearance and friendly manner . <p> " Come inside and get dry ! " the Welshman cried as he waved his hand toward the large stone building that must be the hall , paying no heed to the drink that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ap Gruffydd was n't a drunkard . <p> His expression grim , Lord Alfred swung down from his saddle and came to help her dismount . Once on the ground , she took a deep breath and shook out the full gored skirt of her gown of perse , while Lord Alfred stiffly held out his arm to lead her into the hall behind their host . <p> The soldiers in the yard remained where they were , watchful and suspicious . <p> The hall was rather small , and close , and old , the beams dark with age and smoke . Unlike more recently built halls , it had a central hearth and the roof was held up not by pillars of stone , but wood , some plain , some carved with vines and leaves and faces of animals . Rushes covered the floor , and three large hunting dogs , as shaggy as their master , lumbered to their feet , sniffing at the Normans as they passed . <p> Several servants waited by the walls , watching like the soldiers in the yard , as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single wooden chair arranged around it . <p> After seeing the castle 's fortifications , Roslynn had assumed that the living quarters of Llanpowell would be more modern and comfortable . It was disappointing to discover they were not , but at least they would be dry . <p> And no matter how primitive the accommodations , this was still better than being at King John 's court , where she had to fend off the advances of the king and every other lascivious courtier who believed , given her recent history , that she should be grateful for his attention . <p> " Sit you down by the fire , my lady , " their host said as he threw off his cloak , goblet still in hand . He did n't seem to notice or care that his cloak fell to the rush-covered floor before a servant had time to grab it . <p> " Bron , what are you about , girl ? " he demanded of another maidservant standing by the wall , who looked about eighteen years old . " Take her ladyship 's cloak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roslynn removed the rain-soaked garment . The servant , just as quickly , hurried to hang it on a peg on the wall before returning to her post . <p> It was warmer near the fire , and Roslynn was well dressed in a thick woolen gown and heavy boots , but she shivered nonetheless and wrapped her arms about herself as she took a seat on the bench . <p> Smiling expansively , the Welshman settled his bulk in the chair and grinned at Lord Alfred , who stood so stiffly , one might conclude he was incapable of bending at the waist . <p> " No doubt you 're wondering what has brought us here , " he began just as stiffly . <p> " Aye , I do , but sit down , man ! " the Welsh nobleman commanded with a deep chuckle . " Drink and food before business . Ca n't think of important matters when my belly rumbles . Bron , some mulled wine for our guests , and barley bread and the soft cheese , not the hard . No braggot . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared into what was likely the corridor to the kitchen , the Welshman turned to Roslynn with a wink . " Braggot 's Welsh mead , my lady , and strong , so we best stay with the wine for now . " <br> Continues ...
