The Executioner 's Game Africa It was a bad sun . That 's what the locals said . It was n't customary to think of the sun as something capable of negative energy , but you could n't convince the dark men of that . Periodically they would glance up at it fearfully while executing their harsh duties . The men unloaded crates and stuffed boxes from a flatbed truck , carrying the items to transports , three big trucks  --  one of which was being worked on by two mechanics . The boxes overflowed with packing materials , making the containers look bloated and sick . As the men traversed back and forth from the truck to the plane , they muttered in their native tongue , looking up at the sun as if it might detach from the heavens and roll over the land like a molten boulder . The sun seemed to appear closer to the earth than usual . It filled the horizon , lurching above the low , rolling hills and bright green bush like a sniper who 'd come too close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brownish green mountain range and into the thick jungle , landing finally on the cracked ground of the road in Laundi , a small village that was n't even a speck on the map between the Rwandan border and Kisangani in Central Africa . United States Secretary of Commerce Donald Howard felt a sense of dread as he stood on the side of the road near the beginnings of the bush . But it was n't the sun that made him nervous . What did fill the secretary with dread were the sights he 'd seen in the last few weeks , the utter ruin and death he 'd witnessed in Southern and Central Africa . The AIDS virus had devastated the continent in the last two decades . Howard had been sent by the president to survey the condition of the area and determine the size of a package of economic aid . As an African American , Howard had taken on the assignment with pride and determination . He 'd hoped that his trip to the motherland would result in a cultural awakening for him , a longlost connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite different : economic mayhem , corruption , intra-African racism , a crumbling infrastructure , and a dispirited people . And death . The epidemic had swept the land like a biblical plague , tearing life from the bosom of civilization . Villages were turned into ghost towns , streets were lined with the sick and dying , and rivers were clogged with corpses whose souls had been ripped from their bodies . It was hell on earth , he thought , devastation like none he 'd ever witnessed . And for all his authority , he was powerless to help any of these people . A tiny organism had laid waste an entire civilization , and all he could do was watch . " We 're almost ready , sir , " said George Gorman . He was one of Howard 's Secret Service agents . " The mechanics have pretty much fixed the engine problem in your transport . " Howard was startled for a moment and then looked directly into the eyes of the man who 'd just spoken . Agent Gorman was a tall , lean man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a jaw that was wider than it should have been . It made his head seem a little too big on his shoulders and gave him a look of menace that had served him well in his profession . Gorman was one of two Secret Service men assigned to Howard . Gorman and his partner in turn led a security team comprised of four soldiers , two marines , and two army officers . He stood next to Howard , waiting for him to respond . " How much longer ? " Howard asked impatiently . " About a half hour , sir , " said Gorman . " Fine , " said Howard . " I just want to get out of here as soon as possible . Go and sit on the mechanics . " Gorman nodded and ran off quickly . Howard took a deep breath , letting the strong odors of the land into his lungs . He looked out at the beauty of Africa and was struck by the irony of the wreckage that lay behind it . It was truly a dark continent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Rwanda by land , but the plane the army had provided for them had malfunctioned . And now the armored truck was down as well . It seemed fate was conspiring to keep him in this desolate area . Howard would have a compelling story to tell the president , he thought , and he hoped the American government would not hesitate to come to the assistance of these afflicted people ...
