I was surprised by what I saw in the mirror . It was n't like I 'd never gone 5 days without a shower . It was n't like I 'd never felt the soapy splash of water against grimy forehead and looked up to see a slightly unfamiliar face glowing pink in a strange bathroom . It was the other faces in the ladies ' room mirror . They were staring . Maybe it was my Ziploc toiletry bag sitting on the edge of a gold scallop-shell sink . Maybe it was my hair , which had mutated from cornsilk to hayclump . Or maybe it was because I was in Las Vegas , the broadest and thickest and freakiest cross section of America , and I was the freak , fresh in-and grungy from-the surrounding desert . Just a few hours earlier , I had been kayaking the Black Canyon of the Colorado River and casting clouser minnows to uninterested stripers . In the days before , I 'd mountain biked Gooseberry Mesa . I 'd scrambled from one end of the Zion Narrows to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rented Ford Escape , and ate egg noodles for 3 nights straight . But the money fueling my road trip was circling the drain faster than my filth in the sparkling basin . Outside the bathroom door was a cage of dancing women , a ringing cityscape of slot machines-and one last chance to beat the Strip before it beat me . Time seems to fold on a road trip , when rolling miles create thick-and fast-layers of memory . Tom and I had touched down in Vegas at 5 o'clock on a Saturday , 5 oddly distant days ago . We drove straight out to the quiet of Red Rock Canyon , just 17 miles west of downtown . As the sinking sun saturated the sandstone , the spotlight of the Luxor-the most powerful beam in the world-punched the sky , and Vegas came to alien life . After some sunset scrambling , we drove toward Zion from urban bright to inky black . As the hours turned from 9 to 10 to 11 , we scanned for tent icons but passed only billboards for the Virgin Casino-Buffet $2.99 ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable campground of RVs and dusty tents just off Highway 9 . I did n't plan to start the first full day of the trip face down on a boulder with a rented Devinci Chili Pepper jangled over my back . I know how to ride a bike . But Gooseberry Mesa boasts world-class slickrock that 's painfully accessible to ambitious intermediates like me . Just 25 minutes from Zion , it 's a rock-hopper 's dream : miles of trail swooping through pinons and junipers , sometimes veering within inches of cliffs that fall away hundreds of feet down into the Virgin River valley-dubious geography for someone with a newly formed slickrock inferiority complex . Riding all day after biffing right out of the blocks was probably the hardest thing I had to do on the trip-other than trying to get a permit for the Zion Narrows , a 16-mile route on countless Life Lists . You ca n't just show up and start trucking-you have to reserve a spot the day before you want to hike , and sometimes all 80 permits are snapped up by sunrise . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited with a , few drowsies until the ranger 's window opened at 6:30 . Within 10 minutes of scoring permits , we were swilling black coffees from the Mean Bean and driving to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon , reading aloud from Seabiscuit and eating honey buns from 7-Eleven . We wandered along the rim on the Transept Trail , then tackled the first 2 miles of the dusty North Kaibab . On the way back to Zion , we made two crucial stops : the Three Bears Creamery Cottage for Rocky Road ice cream and a roadside stand for firewood to roast marshmallows and Jiffy Pop . At 5:30 A.M. , we stumbled over to catch Zion Canyon Transportation 's white van to the head of the Narrows . At Chamberlain 's Ranch , the Virgin River starts as a surface gurgle . We found a laminated timetable for the hike-Waterfall , 3:30 ; The Grotto , 6:00 ; Orderville Canyon , 10:00-and gloated like we 'd tripped over a treasure map . The descent was subtle . At first , we hopped to keep our boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees and thighs , and by the time we reached the Temple of Sinawava , we 'd been wading for 8 of the 12 hours . Burnt-orange walls twisted up 2,000 feet , facing off no farther apart than a country road . In the tightest sections , the air was wet and cool , the smell mossy , the river sound steady . The air in the rest of the park that day must have pushed 110 degrees . The smell of the Escape when we opened its four doors at 7:30 P.M. was a mix of toasted bagel and roasted marshmallow . Our forgotten apple looked like a time-lapse experiment gone seriously bad . But there was no time to dwell on lost fruit . We had a two-person kayak reserved for a self-guided tour of the Colorado River just 45 minutes from the Strip . It was close to midnight-again-when we reached Lake Mead , so we pulled over , chucked our gear out the back , and passed out with bare feet hanging over the rear bumper . By the crack of 9 , we were paddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that noted such attractions as " The Ear " ( geological ) , " The Cat Walk " ( governmental ) , and " Ye Olde Outhouse " ( scatalogical ) . Downriver Outfitters drops you off just below Hoover Dam and picks you up 11 miles and 8 hours later , leaving more than enough time to explore dozens of side canyons , hot springs , and caves . Some of the springs are reachable only by a series of rope ladders hung in the warm stinky spray of waterfalls . The only problem ? 120-degree springs do n't sound tempting when it 's already 120 degrees out . The other problem ? Because the water below the dam comes out of the bottom of Lake Mead , it 's always a frigid 54 degrees . By the time we took out , we were clone with the desert . I 'd never actually craved AC and piped-in oxygen before . But I could have kept driving for weeks . To tackle a multiday , multisport , multistate trip is to telescope freedom into a tiny rootless package . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could resolve to live every day like I lived the last 5 , waking up at 5 , covering ground , packing in as much as humanly possible . So not surprisingly , we were ready for the Vegasness of it all : signs for Wee Kirk o ' the Heather wedding chapel and Gilley 's Bikini Bull Riding . Those scallop-shell sinks . And especially the Rio 's seafood buffet . After days of granola bars and warm water , we shoveled it in : Crab legs , sushi , fried cod , halibut in beurre blanc , clam chowder , obscene goblets of margarita . And with time running out , I was ready for seven-card stud at the Excalibur . Since your chances of leaving Vegas a winner go down in direct proportion to time spent trying , the odds were on my side . I made the best of my last hour . My flush-in spades-separated one man from his $40 just minutes before we left to catch a midnight flight . Sidebar <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
