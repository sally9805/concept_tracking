1 . Thieves Freshman fall I think that everything , or at least the part of everything that happened to me , started with the Roman architecture mix-up . Ancient History was my first class of the day , occurring after morning chapel and roll call , which was not actually roll call but a series of announcements that took place in an enormous room with twenty-foot-high Palladian windows , rows and rows of desks with hinged tops that you lifted to store your books inside , and mahogany panels on the wallsone for each class since Ault 's founding in 1882engraved with the name of every person who had graduated from the school . The two senior prefects led roll call , standing at a desk on a platform and calling on the people who 'd signed up ahead of time to make announcements . My own desk , assigned alphabetically , was near the platform , and because I did n't talk to my classmates who sat around me , I spent the lull before roll call listening to the prefects ' exchanges with teachers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Henry Thorpe and Gates Medkowski . It was my fourth week at the school , and I did n't know much about Ault , but I did know that Gates was the first girl in Ault 's history to have been elected prefect . The teachers ' announcements were straightforward and succinct : Please remember that your adviser request forms are due by noon on Thursday . The students ' announcements were lengthythe longer roll call was , the shorter first period would beand filled with double entendres : Boys ' soccer is practicing on Coates Field today , which , if you do n't know where it is , is behind the headmaster 's house , and if you still do n't know whereit is , ask Fred . Where are you , Fred ? You wan na raise your hand , man ? There 's Fred , everyone see Fred ? Okay , so Coates Field . And rememberbring your balls . When the announcements were finished , Henry or Gates pressed a button on the side of the desk , like a doorbell , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to class . In Ancient History , we were making presentations on different topics , and I was one of the students presenting that day . From a library book , I had copied pictures of the Colosseum , the Pantheon , and the Baths of Diocletian , then glued the pictures onto a piece of poster board and outlined the edges with green and yellow markers . The night before , I 'd stood in front of the mirror in the dorm bathroom practicing what I 'd say , but then someone had come in , and I 'd pretended I was washing my hands and left . I was third ; right before me was Jamie Lorison . Mrs. Van der Hoef had set a podium in the front of the classroom , and Jamie stood behind it , clutching index cards . " It is a tribute to the genius of Roman architects , " he began , " that many of the buildings they designed more than two thousand years ago still exist today for modern peoples to visit and enjoy . " My heart lurched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamie 's . I had difficulty listening as he continued , though certain familiar phrases emerged : the aqueducts , which were built to transport water . . . the Colosseum , originally called the Flavian Amphitheater . . . Mrs. Van der Hoef was standing to my left , and I leaned toward her and whispered , " Excuse me . " She seemed not to have heard me . " Mrs. Van der Hoef ? " Thenlater , this gesture seemed particularly humiliatingI reached out to touch her forearm . She was wearing a maroon silk dress with a collar and a skinny maroon belt , and I only brushed my fingers against the silk , but she drew back as if I 'd pinched her . She glared at me , shook her head , and took several steps away . " I 'd like to pass around some pictures , " I heard Jamie say . He lifted a stack of books from the floor . When he opened them , I saw colored pictures of the same buildings I had copied in black-and-white and stuck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , I had never felt anything about Jamie Lorison , who was red-haired and skinny and breathed loudly , but as I watched him take his seat , a mild , contented expression on his face , I loathed him . " Lee Fiora , I believe you 're next , " Mrs. Van der Hoef said . " See , the thing is , " I began , " maybe there 's a problem . " I could feel my classmates looking at me with growing interest . Ault prided itself on , among other things , its teacher-student ratio , and there were only twelve of us in the class . When all their eyes were on me at once , however , that did not seem like such a small number . " I just ca n't go , " I finally said . " I beg your pardon ? " Mrs. Van der Hoef was in her late fifties , a tall , thin woman with a bony nose . I 'd heard that she was the widow of a famous archaeologist , not that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation isor it was going to beI thought I was supposed to talk aboutbut maybe , now that Jamie " " You 're not making sense , Miss Fiora , " Mrs. Van der Hoef said . " You need to speak clearly . " " If I go , I 'll be saying the same thing as Jamie . " " But you 're presenting on a different topic . " " Actually , I 'm talking about architecture , too . " She walked to her desk and ran her finger down a piece of paper . I had been looking at her while we spoke , and now that she had turned away , I did n't know what to do with my eyes . My classmates were still watching me . During the school year so far , I 'd spoken in classes only when I was called on , which was not often ; the other kids at Ault were enthusiastic about participating . Back in my junior high in South Bend , Indiana , many classes had felt like one-on-one discussions between the teacher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doodled . Here , the fact that I did the reading did n't distinguish me . In fact , nothing distinguished me . And now , in my most lengthy discourse to date , I was revealing myself to be strange and stupid . " You 're not presenting on architecture , " Mrs. Van der Hoef said . " You 're presenting on athletics . " " Athletics ? " I repeated . There was no way I 'd have volunteered for such a topic . She thrust the sheet of paper at me , and there was my name , Lee FioraAthletics , in her writing , just below James LorisonArchitecture . We 'd signed up for topics by raising our hands in class ; clearly , she had misunderstood me . " I could do athletics , " I said uncertainly . " Tomorrow I could do them . " " Are you suggesting that the students presenting tomorrow have their time reduced on your behalf ? " " No , no , of course not . But maybe a different day , or maybeI could do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to talk about today is architecture . " " Then you 'll be talking about architecture . Please use the lectern . " I stared at her . " But Jamie just went . " " Miss Fiora , you are wasting class time . " As I stood and gathered my notebook and poster board , I thought about how coming to Ault had been an enormous error . I would never have friends ; the best I 'd be able to hope for from my classmates would be pity . It had already been obvious to me that I was different from them , but I 'd imagined that I could lie low for a while , getting a sense of them , then reinvent myself in their image . Now I 'd been uncovered . I gripped either side of the podium and looked down at my notes . " One of the most famous examples of Roman architecture is the Colosseum , " I began . " Historians believe that the Colosseum was called the Colosseum because of a large statue of the Colossus of Nero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my notes . The faces of my classmates were neither kind nor unkind , sympathetic nor unsympathetic , engaged nor bored . " The Colosseum was the site of shows held by the emperor or other aristocrats . The most famous of these shows was " I paused . Ever since childhood , I have felt the onset of tears in my chin , and , at this moment , it was shaking . But I was not going to cry in front of strangers . " Excuse me , " I said , and I left the classroom . There was a girls ' bathroom across the hall , but I knew not to go in there because I would be too easy to find . I ducked into the stairwell and hurried down the steps to the first floor and out a side door . Outside it was sunny and cool , and with almost everyone in class , the campus felt pleasantly empty . I jogged toward my dorm . Maybe I would leave altogether : hitchhike to Boston , catch a bus , ride back home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not overly prettynot like in New England , where they called the leaves foliage . Back in South Bend , my younger brothers would be spending the evenings kicking the soccer ball in the backyard and coming in for dinner smelling like boy-sweat ; they 'd be deciding on their Halloween costumes , and when my father carved the pumpkin , he would hold the knife over his head and stagger toward my brothers with a maniacal expression on his face , and as they ran shrieking into the other room , my mother would say , " Terry , quit scaring them . " I reached the courtyard . Broussard 's dorm was one of eight on the east side of campus , four boys ' dorms and four girls ' dorms forming a square , with granite benches in the middle . When I looked out the window of my room , I often saw couples using the benches , the boy sitting with his legs spread in front of him , the girl standing between his legs , her hands perhaps set on his shoulders briefly , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of the benches was occupied . A girl in cowboy boots and a long skirt lay on her back , one knee propped up in a triangle , one arm slung over her eyes . As I passed , she lifted her arm . It was Gates Medkowski . " Hey , " she said . We almost made eye contact , but then we did n't . It made me unsure of whether she was addressing me , which was an uncertainty I often felt when spoken to . I kept walking . " Hey , " she said again . " Who do you think I 'm talking to ? We 're the only ones here . " But her voice was kind ; she was n't making fun of me . " Sorry , " I said . " Are you a freshman ? " I nodded . " Are you going to your dorm right now ? " I nodded again . " I assume you do n't know this , but you 're not allowed in the dorm during classes . " She swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us are , " she said . " For Byzantine reasons that I would n't even try to guess at . Seniors are allowed to roam , but roaming only means outside , the library , or the mail room , so that 's a joke . " I said nothing . " Are you okay ? " she asked . " Yes , " I said and began to cry . " Oh God , " Gates said . " I did n't mean to upset you . Here , come sit down . " She was patting the bench beside her , and then she stood , walked toward me , set one arm around my backmy shoulders were heavingand guided me toward the bench . When we were sitting , she passed me a blue bandanna that smelled of incense ; even through the blur of my tears , I was interested by the fact that she carried this accessory . I hesitated to blow my nosemy snot would be on Gates Medkowski 's bandannabut my whole face seemed to be leaking . " What 's your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was high and shaky . " So what 's wrong ? Why are n't you in class or study hall ? " " Nothing 's wrong . " She laughed . " For some reason , I do n't think that 's true . " When I told her what had happened , she said , " Van der Hoef likes to come off like the dragon lady . God knows why . Maybe it 's menopause . But she 's actually pretty nice most of the time . " " I do n't think she likes me . " " Oh , do n't worry . It 's still so early in the school year . She 'll have forgotten all about this by November . " " But I left in the middle of class , " I said . Gates waved one hand through the air . " Do n't even think about it , " she said . " The teachers here have seen everything . We imagine ourselves as distinct entities , but in their eyes , we merge into a great mass of adolescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , though I was pretty sure I had no idea ; I 'd never heard someone close to my own age talk the way she was talking . " Ault can be a tough place , " she said . " Especially at first . " At this , I felt a new rush of tears . She knew . I blinked several times . " It 's like that for everyone , " she said . I looked at her , and , as I did , I realized for the first time that she was very attractive : not pretty exactly , but striking , or maybe handsome . She was nearly six feet tall and had pale skin , fine features , eyes of such a washed-out blue they were almost gray , and a massive amount of long light brown hair that was a rough texture and unevenly cut ; in places , in the sunlight , there were glints of gold in it . As we 'd been talking , she 'd pulled it into a high , loose bun with shorter pieces of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating such a perfectly messy bun required a good fifteen minutes of maneuvering before a mirror . But everything about Gates seemed effortless . " I 'm from Idaho , and I was the biggest hayseed when I got here , " she was saying . " I practically arrived on a tractor . " " I 'm from Indiana , " I said . " See , you must be way cooler than I was because at least Indiana is closer to the East Coast than Idaho . " " But people here have been to Idaho . They ski there . " I knew this because Dede Schwartz , one of my two roommates , kept on her desk a framed picture of her family standing on a snowy slope , wearing sunglasses and holding poles . When I 'd asked her where it was taken , she 'd said Sun Valley , and when I 'd looked up Sun Valley in my atlas , I 'd learned it was in Idaho . " True , " Gates said . " But I 'm not from the mountains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you applied in the first place . It was for the academics , right ? I do n't know where you were before , but Ault beats the hell out of the public high school in my town . As for the politics here , what can you do ? There 's a lot of posturing , but it 's all kind of meaningless . " I was n't certain what she meant by posturingit made me think of a row of girls in long white nightgowns , standing up very straight and balancing hardcover books on their heads . Gates looked at her watch , a man 's sports watch with black plastic straps . " Listen , " she said . " I better get going . I have Greek second period . What 's your next class ? " " Algebra . But I left my backpack in Ancient History . " " Just grab it when the bell rings . Do n't worry about talking to Van der Hoef . You can sort things out with her later , after you 've both cooled off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We started walking back toward the schoolhouseit seemed I was not returning to South Bend after all , at least not today . We passed the roll call room , which during the school day functioned as the study hall . I wondered if any of the students were looking out the window , watching me walk with Gates Medkowski.
