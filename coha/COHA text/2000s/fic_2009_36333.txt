It was an absolutely perfect June day as the sun came up over the city , and Coco Barrington watched it from her Bolinas deck . She sat looking at pink and orange streak across the sky as she drank a cup of steaming Chinese tea , stretched out on an ancient , faded broken deck chair she had bought at a yard sale . A weather-worn wooden statue of Qan Ying observed the scene peacefully . Qan Ying was the goddess of compassion , and the statue had been a treasured gift . Under the benevolent gaze of Qan Ying , the pretty auburn-haired young woman sat in the golden light of the sunrise , as the early summer sun shot copper lights through her long wavy hair , which hung nearly to her waist . She was wearing an old flannel nightgown with barely discernible hearts on it , and her feet were bare . The house she lived in sat on a plateau in Bolinas , overlooking the ocean and narrow beach below . This was exactly where Coco wanted to be . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beach community , less than an hour north of San Francisco , suited her perfectly at twenty-eight . <br> Calling her home a house was generous . It was barely more than a cottage , and her mother and sister referred to it as a hovel or , on better days , a shack . It was incomprehensible to either of them why Coco would want to live there  --  or how she would even tolerate it . It was their worst nightmare come true , even for her . Her mother had tried wheedling , insulting , criticizing , and even bribing her to come back to what they referred to as " civilization " in L.A. Nothing about her mother 's life , or the way she had grown up , seemed " civilized " to Coco . In her opinion , everything about it was a fraud . The people , the way they lived , the goals they aspired to , the houses they lived in , and the face-lifts on every woman she knew . It all seemed artificial to her . Her life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere , just like Coco herself . She hated anything fake . Not that her mother was " fake . " She was polished and had an image she was careful to maintain . Her mother had been a best-selling romance novelist for the past thirty years . What she wrote was n't fraudulent , it simply was n't deep , but there was a vast following for her work . She wrote under the name Florence Flowers , a nom de plume from her own mother 's maiden name , and she had enjoyed immense success . She was sixty-two years old and had lived a storybook life , married to Coco 's father , Bernard " Buzz " Barrington , the most important literary and dramatic agent in L.A. until his death four years before . He had been sixteen years older than her mother and was still going strong when he died of a sudden stroke . He had been one of the most powerful men in the business , and had babied and protected his wife through all thirty-six years of their marriage . He had encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother would have made it as a writer in the early days without her father 's help . Her mother never asked herself the same question and did n't for an instant doubt the merit of her work , or her myriad opinions about everything in life . She made no bones about the fact that Coco was a disappointment to her , and did n't hesitate to call her a dropout , a hippie , and a flake . <br> Coco 's equally successful sister Jane 's assessment of her was loftier , though not kinder : Jane referred to Coco as a " chronic underachiever . " She pointed out to her younger sister that she had had every possible opportunity growing up , every chance to make a success of her life , and thus far had thrown it all away . She reminded her regularly that it was n't too late to turn the boat around , but as long as she continued to live in a shack in Bolinas like a beach bum , her life would be a mess . <br> Her life did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was respectable , she did n't do drugs and never had , other than the occasional joint with friends in college , and even that had been rare , which was remarkable at that age . She was n't a burden on her family , had never been evicted , promiscuous , pregnant , or in jail . She did n't criticize her sister 's lifestyle , and had no desire to ; nor did she tell her mother that the clothes she wore were ridiculously young , or that her last face-lift still looked too tight . All Coco wanted was to be her own person and lead her own life , in the way she chose . She had always been uncomfortable with their luxurious Bel-Air lifestyle , hated being singled out as the child of two famous people , and more recently the much younger sister of one . She did n't want to lead their life , only her own . Her battles with them had begun in earnest after she had graduated with honors from Princeton , went to Stanford law school a year later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been three years since then . <br> She had promised her father she would try law , and he assured her there was a place for her in his agency . He said it helped to have a law degree if you were going to be a successful agent . The trouble was she did n't want to be one , especially working for her father . She had absolutely no desire whatsoever to represent best-selling authors , scriptwriters , or badly behaved movie stars , which were her father 's passion , bread and butter , and only interest in life . Every famous name in Hollywood had come through their house when she was a child . She could n't imagine spending the rest of her life with them , as her father had . She secretly believed all the stress of representing and indulging spoiled , unreasonable , insanely demanding people for nearly fifty years had killed him . It sounded like a death sentence to her . <br> He had died during her first year in law school , and she stuck it out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried over it for months , still berated her for it , and told her she lived like a homeless person in the shack in Bolinas . She had only seen it once , and had ranted about it ever since . Coco had decided to stay in the San Francisco area after dropping out of Stanford . Northern California suited her better . Her sister Jane had moved there years before , but commuted to L.A. frequently to work . Their mother was still upset that both her children had moved north and fled L.A. although Jane was there a lot . Coco rarely went home . <br> Coco 's sister Jane was thirty-nine years old . By the time she was thirty , she had become one of the most important film producers in Hollywood . She 'd had a dazzling career so far , and eleven record-breaking box-office hits . She was a huge success , which only made Coco look worse . Her mother never stopped telling Coco how proud their father had been of Jane , and then she 'd burst into tears again , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always worked well for her , and got her everything she wanted from Coco 's father . Buzz had thoroughly indulged his wife and adored his daughters . Coco liked to believe at times that she could have explained her choices , and the reasons for them to him , but in truth she knew she could n't have . He would n't have understood them any better than her mother or sister did , and he would have been both baffled and disappointed by her current life . He 'd been thrilled when she got into law school at Stanford , and hoped it would put an end to her previously extremely liberal ideas . In his opinion it was all right to be kind-hearted and concerned about the planet and your fellow man , as long as you did n't carry it too far . In her college days and before , Buzz thought she had , but he had assured her mother that law school would get her head on straight . Apparently it had n't , since she dropped out . <br> Her father had left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never touched it , she preferred to spend only what she earned , and often gave money away to causes that were important to her , most of them involved in ecology , the preservation of animal life on the planet , or to assist indigent children in Third World countries . Her sister Jane called her a bleeding heart . They had a thousand unflattering adjectives for her , all of which hurt . Coco readily admitted that she was a " bleeding heart , " however , which was why she loved the statue of Qan Ying so much . The goddess of compassion touched her very soul . Coco 's integrity was impeccable , and her heart was huge and constantly focused on kindness to others , which did n't seem like a bad thing to her , nor a crime . <br> Jane had caused her own ripples in the family in her late teens . At seventeen , she had told her parents that she was gay . Coco had been six at the time , and unaware of the stir it made . Jane announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and became a militant activist for lesbian rights at UCLA , where she studied film . <br> Her mother was heartbroken when she asked her to be a debutante , and Jane refused . She said she 'd rather die . But in spite of her different sexual preferences , and early militancy , essentially she had the same material goals as her parents . Her father forgave her once he watched her set her sights on fame . And as soon as she achieved it , all was well again . For the past ten years Jane had lived with a well-known screenwriter who was a gentle person and famous in her own right . They had moved to San Francisco because of the large gay community there . Everyone in the universe had seen their films and loved them . Jane had been nominated for four Oscars but had n't won one yet . Her mother had no problem now with Jane and Elizabeth living as partners for the past decade . It was Coco who upset them all deeply , who worried the hell out of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , her indifference to what they thought was important , and it made her mother cry . <br> Eventually , they blamed Coco 's attitudes on the man she was living with when she dropped out of law school , rather than their effect on her for years before . He had lived with her during her second and final year of law school , and had left law school himself without graduating several years before . Ian White was everything her parents did n't want for her . Although smart , capable , and well educated , as Jane put it , he was an " underachiever " just like her . After leaving school in Australia , Ian had come to San Francisco , and opened a diving and surfing school . He had been bright , loving , funny , easy-going , and wonderful to her . He was a rough diamond and an independent sort who did whatever he wanted , and Coco knew she had found her soul mate the day they met . They moved in together two months later , when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best years of her life , and she had no regrets , except that he was gone , and had been for two years . He died in a hang-gliding accident , when a gust of wind crashed him into the rocks , and he fell to his death below . It was over in an instant , and their dreams went with him . They had bought the shack in Bolinas together , and he left it to her . His wet suits and diving gear were still at the cottage . She 'd had a hard time for the first year after he died , and her mother and sister had been sympathetic in the beginning , but since then their sympathy had run out . As far as they were concerned , he was gone , and she should get over it , get a life , grow up . She had , but not the way they chose . That was a capital offense to them . <br> Coco herself knew that she had to let go of Ian 's memory and move on . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , but no one came close to Ian . She had never met a man with as much life , energy , warmth , and charm . He was a tough act to follow , but she hoped that someday someone would come along . They just had n't yet . Even Ian would n't have wanted her to be alone . But she was in no hurry . Coco was happy living in Bolinas , waking up every day , facing each day as it came . She was on no career path . She did n't want or need fame to validate herself , as the rest of her family did . She did n't want to live in a big house in Bel-Air . She did n't want anything more than she 'd had with Ian , beautiful days and happy times , and loving nights , all of which she knew she would carry with her forever . She did n't need to know where her next steps would lead , or with whom . Each day was a blessing unto itself . Her life with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the last two years since his death , she had made her peace with being on her own . She missed him , but had finally accepted that he 'd gone on . She was n't frantic to get married , have children , or meet another man . At twenty-eight , none of that seemed pressing , and just rolling along in Bolinas was more than enough for her . <br> At first , living there had seemed odd to her and Ian as well . It was a funny little community . The local residents had chosen years before not only to be inconspicuous but to virtually disappear , like Brigadoon . There were no road signs to indicate how to get to Bolinas , or even to admit that it was there . You had to find it on your own . It was a time warp that they had both laughed at and loved . In the sixties it had been full of hippies and flower children , many of whom were still there . Only now they were weather beaten and wrinkled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixties , headed for the beach with their surfboards under their arms . The only shops in town were a clothing store , which still sold flowered muumuus and everything tie-dyed , a restaurant full of grizzled old surfers , a grocery store with mostly organic food , and a head shop that sold every possible kind of paraphernalia and bongs in all colors , shapes , and sizes . The town itself sat on a plateau that hung over a narrow beach , and an inlet separated it from the long expanse of Stinson Beach and the expensive houses there . There were a few beautiful homes tucked away in Bolinas , but mostly there were families , dropouts , older surfers , and people who , for whatever reason , had chosen to get away and disappear . It was an elitist community in its own way , and the antithesis of everything she had grown up with , and the high-powered family Ian had fled in Sydney , Australia . They had been perfectly matched that way . He was gone now , but she was still there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or maybe ever , no matter what her mother and sister said . The therapist she had seen after Ian died , until recently , had told her that she was still rebelling at twenty-eight . Maybe so , but as far as Coco was concerned , it worked for her . She was happy in the life she had chosen , and the place where she lived . And the one thing she knew for sure was that she was never , ever going back to live in L.A. <br> Continues ...
