<p> Now that the air has started to clear from last week 's battlefield of authorial misdeeds , it seems altogether fitting that a Web site known as the Smoking Gun ( www.thesmokinggun.com ) played such an important role in this latest episode of the truth wars . Anyone who dares to tangle with real events in print these days is well advised to take cover . Someone may well be coming after you , checking the facts and checking them twice . <p> James Frey , who was nailed by the Smoking Gun for exaggerations and misrepresentations in his best-selling memoir " A Million Little Pieces , " is one of two fresh victims . The other is JT LeRoy , an elusive , demimonde wunderkind who played a teasing game of hide-and-seek about his past and his identity in his books and public appearances . Press reports in New York Magazine , the New York Times and elsewhere claim he is the literary invention of a middle-aged woman and a bewigged impersonator . <p> Hands have been wringing steadily about all this . Does n't truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's with the awful blond wig ? And so on . <p> Frey has come under especially intense scrutiny , even as he fessed up ( under heavy media pressure ) to some of the liberties he took in retailing his hardscrabble life as an addict and his brushes with the law . Among other things , it seems , Frey did not in fact spend three months in jail after a 1990s rehab stint , as he wrote . Even the dental work he described has come into question . <p> With sales of more than 2 million copies last year  --  the book received talk show host Oprah Winfrey 's lucrative blessing  --  " A Million Little Pieces " is not just a nonfiction hit . It 's the publishing equivalent of a gushing oil well . It 's no wonder , then , that Frey is in everybody 's crosshairs . Lying is one thing . Lying and making a lot of money doing it may be just too much to take . <p> Fellow memoirist Mary Karr ( " The Liars ' Club " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disingenuously blurring the line between fact and fiction and for ducking behind the shield of memory 's interpretive license . Karr characterized Frey 's faux memoir as " a fairy tale , where events were seemingly concocted with impunity . " <p> Times columnist Maureen Dowd , who has just taken some knocks for her own recent combustive nonfiction book " Are Men Necessary ? When Sexes Collide , " zinged Winfrey for heralding Frey 's " message of redemption " in a telephone call to " Larry King Live . " The beleaguered Frey was on the show at the time in his own defense . Dowd compared Winfrey to Scott McClellan , George W. Bush 's prevaricating White House press secretary . <p> LeRoy , by contrast , has taken a decidedly lighter cudgeling . Viewed more as a prankster than a menace to Western literature , this evanescent author seems to be skating by under the radar . Even the writer 's own Web site ( www.jtleroy.com ) is gamely playing along . " The JT LeRoy 's hard at work on the next novel , " reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anonymous typists . One ca n't help wondering if LeRoy would have come in for more heat as a best-selling author , like Frey , than as the cultish curiosity he/she is . <p> Whatever their motives or multiple agendas , the critics and pundits are quite right to express concern about works of nonfiction that do not represent what they claim to represent . The written word is in enough trouble , with risk-averse book publishers , a celebrity-obsessed magazine culture and widespread mistrust of the mainstream press in the wake of assorted fabrications and plagiarism cases . A phonied-up memoir is only a symbol for more urgent issues . <p> Solid , reliably sourced reporting , commentary and discourse , after all , still lies at the heart of an open and open-minded society . At a time when the federal government seems bent on wiretapping private citizens ' conversations , planting paid-for stories in the foreign press and compelling journalists back home to unmask anonymous sources , that principle deserves particular attention . <p> Meanwhile , before The Smoking Gun gets fired up to shoot down another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth acknowledging the context of rampant subjectivity that surrounds any discussion of verifiable , objective reality these days . Wherever you turn , from computer screens to movie screens , bookstores to Congress , " truth " has become an infinitely bendable concept  --  adaptable , flexible , provisional , contingent , perhaps an illusory figment . We are all , it seems , fully engaged in the age of " truthiness "  --  the word of the year for 2005 , according to an American Dialect Society panel of linguists . It 's the appearance of truth , not some literal , fact-bound certainty , that serves as our rudder . Consider the evidence : <p> Tens of millions of Americans  --  more all the time  --  now construct their own identities on Internet blogs , posts , chat rooms and the teenage haven of MySpace.com . Ten years into a diet of reality television and ever more absorbing video games , the public has grown accustomed to life as an ongoing , invented scenario . Actual televised images of the war in Iraq ( from the privileged and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with a fictional version of the war in the TV series " Over There . " Is everybody keeping this straight ? <p> Movies ( " Munich , " " Syriana , " " Capote , " " Good Night , and Good Luck , " " Walk the Line " ) are increasingly dependent on real-world sources for material that is then subject to dramatic heightening , emphases and alteration . In a parallel development , documentaries ( " Fahrenheit 9/11 , " " Super Size Me , " " Wal-Mart : The High Cost of Low Price , " " Capturing the Friedmans , " " ) openly declare either their ideological slants or invoke a prevailing climate of uncertainty and ambivalence . <p> Fiction , as Jon Carroll pointed out in a recent column , continues to lose book-selling market share to nonfiction ( once you leave " Harry Potter " author J.K. Rowling and a few other heavy-selling novelists out of the equation ) . One of the fascinating , telling twists to the " Million Little Pieces " dustup is the fact that the manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only when Frey and his agent repackaged it as a memoir did the book make it into print and attract Oprah 's adoring gaze . " Creative nonfiction , " now widely taught in college and university writing programs , is the current genre of choice . Frey , as he and others have argued , was simply employing a license with the truth that 's already in common use . <p> It 's not hard to make a case that the consequences of all this are troubling . As fabrication and manufactured reality occupy more and more space in our collective consciousness , as truthiness stands in for truthfulness , cynicism ca n't be far behind . Of course scientists like Hwang Woo Suk will falsify their research . Of course athletes will take performance-enhancing drugs . Of course the administration will lie or dissemble about Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction . Of course members of Congress will trade their votes and their honor for a handout from lobbyist Jack Abramoff . It 's all about improvisation and keeping up appearances . <p> But then again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this game than that . Among the great pleasures and promises of 21st century life is our own self-awareness , our media-tutored sensibility about a mediated age . Technology has taught us to be wary of technology . TV warns us against itself . Writers , filmmakers and visual artists revel in the ambiguities and imprecision of their own work . We can happily submit to a con now  --  whether it 's reality TV , fiction packaged as nonfiction or a fraud dressed up as truthiness  --  and know we 're doing it . That 's not to say we ca n't be had . But now , if it happens , we ca n't say we did n't see it coming .
