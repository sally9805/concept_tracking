A Night at the Teatre 89 Te curtain goes up . Silence falls . A painted moon wavers on a painted backdrop . The audience shivers with delight . For what could be better than an evening at a Paris theatre ? Who more famous than the evening 's glittering star ? Enter the magnificent Montfleury , stage right ! The mighty Montfleury had not spoken more than three lines when a voice even louder than his own came booming out of the auditorium : " What ? Has this thing appeared again tonight ? " The audience parted like the Red Sea , and there he stood : Cyrano had come after all . " Montfleury , I thought I forbade you ever to set foot on stage again ! You are the greatest ham since the Gadarene Swine . Be so good as to cart your streaky bacon off the stage and be gone ! " Uproar . Half the audience began to moan and groan , not wanting to be robbed of the play they had come to see . The rest were just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be grossly huge and Cyrano as lean as a greyhound , but as celebrities went , Cyrano de Bergerac was by far the larger -- larger than Life , in fact . Montfleury flung his arms about and tried to begin again , but it was hopeless . " Call yourself an actor ? The trees of Birnam Wood were less wooden in Macbeth ! Will you leave the stage of your own accord or must I cut you up into logs and burn you ? " The actor'slines gurgled back down his throat like water down a drain . He could see the white panache on Cyrano 's hat looming through the smoke of the footlights , and his two fat little legs told him to run . The audience took sides : " Get on with the play ! " " You tell him , Cyrano ! " " Stand your ground , Montfleury ! " " Teach him a lesson , Cyrano ! " But the other actors were protesting on their own behalf . " Who 's going to pay us if we pack up and go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection to Montfleury-the-Ham getting hamstrung , but they could not afford to lose an evening 's pay . With a flourish worthy of royalty , Cyrano tossed back his cloak , reached across his body . . . " He 's going for his sword ! " . . . and drew out a bulging purse . He tossed it onto the stage where it burst gloriously open , spilling golden coins across the boards and fetching an acrobatic display from the actors as they dived to gather it up . Applause and peals of laughter burst from the gallery : The play might be lost , but the gesture was too impossibly grand to resist . What a divine fool that Cyrano was ! What a colossus of style ! Quel panache ! On the sill of a nearby opera box , however , the fingers of a black-gloved hand drummed irritably . " The Gascon is making a nuisance of himself , " said the Comte de Guiche , through a yawn of exquisite boredom . " Do something about him . " One of his retinue slipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyrano had started to list , in verse , all the reasons for drowning bad actors in big buckets . But he had no sooner started than he was interrupted by a jeering , sneering heckler . " What 's this , then ? Is Sir-run-nose poking his nose in again where it do n't belong ? " The crowd gave a gasp . So ! The evening 's excitements were not over after all ! A foppish young viscount lounged against the edge of the stage , flicking pieces of orange peel around the floor with the tip of his elegant sword , and smirking . " And such an ugly nose , too , " he tittered . A spot of colour touched Cyrano 's cheek and he glanced up fleetingly at the gallery . Five hundred pairs of eyes swung to see what he would do next . After a long silence , even the fop cocked a puzzled eyebrow . " Well ? What are you waiting for ? Are n't you going to cross swords with me ? I insulted your big fat nose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong-footed . " I --  " " You call that an insult ? " Cyrano declaimed . " Tch-tch-tch . I have trodden in worse insults than that on the pavement . My God , man ! If you 're going to insult me , at least do it with a little style ! A little panache ! Good Lord ! There are as many schools of insult as there are tribes of Israel , and is that the best you can come up with ? I see I must teach you the Art of the Insult ! " At last the sword came out -- a noise like a snake uncoiling . The onlookers shivered with delicious horror and drew back as far as possible , boys thrust behind their mothers , wives peeping over their husbands ' shoulders . Once more Cyrano 's grey-brown eyes flickered toward the upper gallery of the theatre and he raised the hilt of his sword to his lips in salute to someone seated there . He did not remove his hat : Perhaps he knew that , from up there , its brim concealed his huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fast as the spoke of a carriage wheel it moved . Its reach was as long as a moonbeam . In his hand , it was summer lightning . His voice was calm and very slightly taunting . Such a silence had fallen that his words were audible from the front stalls to the upper gallery . " One ! There is the Insult Theatrical . Let me give you an example : O brave New World that has such noses in it ! " Two ! There is the Insult Geographical : Just walking round you is like rounding Cape Horn ! " Three ! The Insult Inquisitive : Does it not cause you to tilt over , monsieur , or do you wear counterweights in your boots ? " The crowd roared with laughter , while the fop roared with frustration , his lunges and parries hitting nothing but the empty air as Cyrano stepped deftly round him . " Four ! There is the Insult Punning : Where does Cyrano come to an end ? Nobody nose ! " Five ! The Insult Explanatory : Do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet from getting sunburnt ! " Six ! The Insult Medical : When you have a cold , monsieur , Belgium floods ! " Seven ! The Insult Biblical : It was n't Ararat where Noah ran aground , you know ! " By this time , the gallant had forgotten about sarcastic remarks or showing off or even fencing . He had simply begun to run , lifting his heels higher than his kneecaps as Cyrano carved him clear of the floor . " You might have attempted Eight ! The Insult Exaggeration : Have a care ! When you sneeze , whole fleets sink in the Spanish Main ! " Or Nine ! The Insult Unsporting : You must be the only man who can win a race by a nose before the starter has even fired his gun ! " Or Ten ! The Insult Sentimental : Aaah ! How kind of you , monsieur , to provide a perch for so many ickle squiwwels and birdies ! " And now -- to make an end -- the Insult Well-Intentioned : If you ever lose your scabbard , at least you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One small flick of his wrist , and Cyrano whipped the foil from his opponent 's hand and sent it skidding among the floor rushes . " . . . sword . But no ! You aspired to none of these ! The words you offered me were about as witty as a dead rat , as clever as a used handkerchief , as original as Thursday ! " He leaned forward , as if to dislodge a fly from a cake , and the viscount cowered down , eyes shut , trying to shield the whole of his body with two thin arms . " So , by your leave , I think I shall not put myself to the trouble of actually fighting you , monsieur . " He added coldly : " The real shame rests with whoever sent you . " Then Cyrano plunged his sword back into its sheath , leaving the fop gibbering and half-naked amid the rags of his shredded clothing . As the man scrambled and tripped his way out onto the street , he could scarcely believe his luck at getting away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that the tip of his nose was dripping blood delicately onto his lacy shirt . He had been too scared even to feel the nick . Turning to acknowledge the cheers , Cyrano 's grey-brown eyes glanced upward once more and rested for a fleeting moment on the face in the gallery . His beautiful young cousin reproached him with a shake of her head , but even she could not help smiling at his spectacular , idiotic coup de thtre . Then , in the swish of a silken gown , she was gone , and it was as if one of the great multitiered chandeliers had blown out in the draught . " Well ! Have you made enough enemies for one night ? " said Cyrano 's friend le Bret . " One : Montfleury . Two : the owner of the theatre . Three : that little viscount you shredded . Four . . . " " In that case , my cup runneth over with happiness ! " said Cyrano ferociously . " Everywhere I go , arrogant little jackanapes jump out of the woodwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duel . It is tedious in the extreme . " " You idiot , Cyrano . You 'll never get rich if you go about chopping up members of the nobility ! And talking of money . . . that was a year 's pay you threw on stage . What are you going to live on now ? " " I 'll manage , " said Cyrano with a shrug . " Sometimes one single moment is worth a year 's pay ! Some nights the heart strains at its tethers , does n't it , and wants to break free and float upward toward the moon . . .
