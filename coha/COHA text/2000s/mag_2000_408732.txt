INTERVIEW Headnote One of the earliest Messerschmitt Me- 110 aces , " Wolf " Falck later helped give that failed escort fighter a new lease on life . // When men first took to the air in flying machines , few of them foresaw the impact this innovation would have on the future of warfare . World War I her , aided new tactics , including the concept of night flying . At first , equipped with crude instrumentation and limited navigational aids , only bombers , with their multipurpose crews , could attempt hazardous night flying , while for the fighters that occasionally rose against them , interception was very much a hit or miss affair . Little had changed in that regard when World War 11 began on September 1 , 1939 . By the time it ended in 1945 , however , night interception had evolved into a deadly science . Among the pioneers of night fighting was German fighter pilot Wolfgang Falck , who , as early as 1939 , saw the possibility of an effective force to challenge British night bombers , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas were enthusiastically entertained by Nazi Chancellor Adolf Hitler and Reichsmarschall Hermann GOring , allowing Falck to introduce many aviation firsts , such as on-board , aerial radar-detection systems , ground control relay stations and radar-guided antiaircraft batteries . The successes of the night fighter pilots who followed in Falck 's footsteps gave strong testimony to the soundness of his concepts . Today " Wolf " Falck lives in quiet retirement in Austria 's Tyrolian Alps with his third wife , Gisela , the widow of the late 108-victory fighter ace Hans " Assi " Hahn . He is still in contact with many of his former Luftwaffe comrades . In a recent interview for Military His @ , Falck stressed that even in the madness of war , a man must never lose his humanity . Military History : When and where were you born ? Falck : I was born in Berlin on August 19 , 1910 . My family came from Danzig , which is now Gdansk in Poland . My mother was from Bremen , and my father was from Prussia , a pastor . My sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My sister Irmgard was born on July 19 , 1904 . They both married officers and had children .

Falck : From 1917 to 19311 was educated in the Reakymnasium equivalent to high school in the United States at BerlinTeptow and I passed the Abitur ( final gradu , ation examinations . I became a member of a flying group , some of us students who under the watchful eye and control of a teacher built and flew models of gliders . Since we were living in Berlin , I visited all of the airshows in the area , including airports where I admired and studied the different types of aircraft . IM : How did you become a pilot ? Falck : That is quite a long story . From April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the German Commercial Flight School in Schleisseim , near Munich , where I finished training . I then went on to infantry school at the training regiment in Dresden for two courses . This was due to the fact that the Versailles Treaty limited Germany to a 100,000-man army ; the navy was allowed only 15,000 men , and the air force was totally banned . This military force was called the Reichswehr , and each year the army took about 225 volunteers as cadets to be educated as officers . MH : How difficult was it to get accepted ? Falck : Thousands applied each year , and it was considered great luck if you were accepted . My unit , the 2nd Rifle Battalion , 7th Infantry Regiment , Hirschberg/Silesia , decided to take me as one of the five men accepted each year . Since the German government decided to establish its own air arm , the Ministry of Defense selected 30 young men from the regiments each year to receive the education necessary to become pilots . This would go on in secret for one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky to be one of the 30 who were sent to the German Commercial Pilot 's School at Schleissheim , where we were officially trained as airliner pilots . After the one-year training period , 20 were sent back to their regiments , while 10 were selected to spend about half a year in Lipetzk , Russia . The trip took 24 hours by train , with our destination being just south of Moscow , where we were to be trained as fighter pilots . At that time there existed a top-secret arrangement between the Reichswehr and the Red Army , and Germany was allowed to operate that school away from the eyes of the Western governments . There was also a camp farther to the north for making and training with chemical weapons , and another training camp close to the Ural Mountains for tanks . So this is how I spent the summer of 1932 , from April to September in Russia . It was a wonderful time for me and for the " Black Air Force . " On October 1 , 1932 , 1 rejoined my regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was now a qualified fighter pilot . I soon went to the academy for future officers in Dresden until September 1934 . During the time when the normal cadets trained at a camp proving ground , I was sent with the other pilots for refresher training at Schleisseim . On October 1 , 1934 , 1 was promoted to Leu=nt second lieutenant and simultaneously eliminated , or " retired , " from the army . I then joined the German Air Transport Association and earned the title of Kettenfahrer flight leader . That organization was the camouflage for the future Luftwaffe , and I later became the chief instructor . In March 1935 , Hitter terminated all the restrictions placed on Germany , and we were officially designated the Fighter Pilots School . Then we were again officially readmitted into the German armed forces , in this case the Luftwaffe . I was reinstated as a Leu=nt . NM : Where did you go after that ? Falck : In April 1936 1 was assigned to Jagdgeschwader Fighter Wing 2 " Richthofen , " and I was assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My primary job there was to train the young new pilots who came to us from the fighter school . In 1937 1 was promoted to Oberleu=nt first lieutenant . When the squadron leader was given a command at the academy , I became the commanding officer of that squadron at the age of 27 . Later that year I became the adjutant to the group commander and was stationed at D6beritz , not far from Berlin . In 1938 , a third group of JG.2 was stationed at Forstenwalde to the east , and it was there that I became a squadron leader , holding the position but not the rank . Later in 1938 , we were given a new name and refitted as 2nd Staffel of Zerst6rergeschwader Destroyer Wing 76 2/ZG.761 , a heavy fighter squadron , equipped with the new Messerschmitt Me- I IOC-I . We received our new planes , and from that point on we no longer operated in singleengine fighters . Now we had a rear gunner , two engines and greater range . It was with this unit that I flew my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the Me-110 fly in comparison to the Junkers Ju-88 or the Me- 109 ? Falck : The 109 was a pure fighter , so you really can not compare the two . The Ju-88 was a tricky and dangerous aircraft to fly , even for an experienced pilot . Anyone who could fly a Ju-88 could usually fly anything else we had-an opinion seconded by my colleague Hans-Joachim " Hajo " Herrmann , who flew 240 missions in it . The Ju-88 had greater range and could carry heavier armament , but a stall could be fatal , and that was not hard to have . Many pilots , such as Hans-Joachim Jabs and Heinz Wolfgang Schauffer , actually preferred the 110 .

He led I Gnippe of ZG . I when he downed a Danish Fokker C.V for his final victory on April 9,1940. // Mi : How was the Me-110 's cockpit design ? Falck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in most German aircraft . It was a simple design , with two rpm gauges ( one for each engine ) and the standard compass , fuel , altimeter , turn-back indicator , and plenty of room for me , since I 'm not a large person . NM : What about survivability ? Did the crew have a good chance of getting out in case of an emergency ? Falck : Not really . The pilot would normally have to get out first if the gunner and radioman were to have a chance of moving through the cockpit . If the pilot was at high altitude , then this was possible , but if he was hit during a ground-attack mission , this was not such a good thing . However , you could have one damaged engine and make it home , as long as the trim , wing and rudder surfaces were intact . It could take a lot of damage and still fly , but being liquid-cooled , the engines were vulnerable . The greatest danger was a fire , with the way the fuel lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was your first combat ? Falck : On September 1 , 1939 , we invaded Poland , and I flew early morning operations to Krak6w in the south . On that mission , we escorted a bomber group , which made a raid on an enemy airfield . No Polish aircraft were to be seen . During the next few days , I scored my first three victories , obsolete Polish aircraft . MH : Did n't you almost shoot down a German Junkers Ju-87B on the first day ? Falck : Well , I was flying with my Schwann flight when we saw a lone aircraft . We always flew in formation , and lone aircraft at low altitudes were usually enemy planes . I signaled to the men that I would bounce this " enemy . " I dropped the nose and hit left rudder to close in from behind . As I pulled up I saw the target getting bigger and bigger . I was about 200 meters away when I touched the trigger . Only a couple of shots passed , and then I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctive wing shape of the Stuka was not that clear . Only after I passed did I radio to my men to escort the already damaged aircraft back . Come to think of it , the pilot of that Stuka was Kurt Kuhlmey , a future Knight 's Cross winner himself in the dive bomber . That would have been a tragedy , do n't you think ? MH : Where were you assigned next , after Poland was overrun ? Falck : After the Polish campaign was finished , we were transferred to the Western Front to protect Germany against possible French air raids , but we never had any . On December 17 , 1939 , we flew to northern Germany to our new air base at jever , close to the North Sea and west of Wilhelmshaven . I was involved in a December 18 air battle , now referred to as the Battle of the German Bight , where the Royal Air Force RAF tried to bomb German ships in Wilhelmshaven Harbor with 24 Vickers Wellington bombers . Photograph Top : Oberleutnant Falck ( left ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockpit of their Me- I IOC- I of 2/ZG .76 in 1939 . Above : Vickers Wellingtons fly information before the war . Falck downed two Wellingtons over Heligoland Bight on December 18 , 1939 , but had to force-land after return fire disabled both of his engines . // 1@ffl : What was your participation in that aerial engagement ? Falck : I shot down two and claimed a probable , but when we added up the total Of claims , it was something like 14 planes destroyed . We did not have cameras at the time , so we had to rely heavily on our comrades for accuracy , since planes crashing into the sea do not leave much to took for later . Fortunately , there were some naval personnel who were catching part of this . Later , we decided that only 12 had actually been shot down . It was not until long after the war that I discovered that others from the formation were written off when they returned to their base , and that another had crashed after being damaged . MH : Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940 , 1 was promoted to Hauptmann captain and made commanding officer of I /ZG. 1 . While with that wing , I participated in the campaigns against Denmark and Norway , which commenced on April 9,1940 . On that same day , I caught a Danish Fokker C.V reconnaissance biplane as it was taking off and shot it down for my seventh and last confirmed victory . There were a few more that were unconfirmed . My later operations started on May 10 with the invasions of Holland , Belgium and France , and also operations on the English Channel coast against the RAE Nffl : Goring had had high hopes for the Me- 110 and the Zersowruaffe as an elite arm of the Luftwaffe , but the heavy casualties the Me- I 10s suffered during the Battle of Britain shattered that image . How did Me- 110 aces like yourself fare in the German press ? FaIck : Not very famous . Most of the 110 pilots who became high-scoring aces transferred to the 109 or became night fighters . There were of course exceptions , such as Hans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 110. 1 can not think of a single Knight 's Cross winner who was a day fighter in the 110 during his entire career . The big problem was that after the Battle of Britain many of them were shot down , and GOring was forced to pull them back along with the Stukas . Part of this decision was mine , since I knew that the 110 was a better aircraft in the night fighting role . Nffl : How did you become the " Father of the Night Fighters " ? Falck : I first began thinking about the night fighter idea after we relocated to Aalborg in northern Denmark . Every evening the RAF bombers flew over us on their way to bomb Germany and then again on their return trip . They would also bomb our airfield or machine-gun our aircraft during low-level attacks , and here we were , the fighter pilots , sitting in a trench ! This was a very demoralizing situation for us . I thought , " If the RAF can fly at night , so could we . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three other crews , and the resuits were positive . It was possible but would necessitate modifications to the aircraft . It also required making arrangements with the local anti-aircraft battery commander concerning search lights , and later with the only radar station , which was located not far from us . One night , or rather very early in the morning the RAF returned from a raid into Germany and , as usual , dropped a few bombs on our airfield . I ordered the flight to take off with four planes , hoping to meet them . Three of us saw an enemy bomber and we went in to attack , but it disappeared into the fog just over the sea . From that mission , however , we learned that it was possible , with a certain amount of organization , modified aircraft and special ammunition that would not blind us at night , to fight the bombers at night . My group commander asked me to write a report about the experience , including all of my proposals for such missions . I did the report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less the only one read by the higher authorities , including GOring and Hitler . MH : What was the result of this review ? Falck : Well , the birthday of the Nachtjagd*gerdienst Night Fighter Service was June 26 , 1940 , when I was made Kommodore of the new outfit . I was with my wing stationed on the northern Channel coast of France , west of Le Havre , just before the beginning of the Battle of Britain . All of a sudden , I received special orders to move to Msseldorf in order to fly against the British bombers at night . The RAF was attacking the Ruhr district , Cologne , etc . I was very angry about the order because we had no experience , the crews did not possess the necessary knowledge to accomplish the task , and we did not have all of the necessary equipment-all of which I had expressly requested in my report . Two days later , I was summoned to Wassenaar in Holland to meet with Feldmarschall Goring , and during this meeting he ordered me to establish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On July 19 , 1940 , 1 was promoted to major , and I was the first Geschwoderkommodore of the new generation-and the youngest . Not long after that , I received another wing , which became NJG.2 . Very soon thereafter I received crews that were fresh from destroyer school as well as a flood of volunteers and complete groups , which we converted to night fighting . Since I was " the Old Man " and the inventor of this idea , the men named me " Father of the Night Fighters , " which has followed me ever since . NM : How long did you remain as commander of these groups ? Photograph An aerial photograph of the city of Cologne after the Royal Air Force 's Thousand Bomber Raid of May 30-31 , 1942 . In the summer of 1940 , Falck was ordered to organize and command the first Nachtjagdgeschwader , NJG. 1 , to defend Cologne and the Ruhr Valley . // Falck : About three years . In 1943 , 1 transferred to the general staff where I became 1 A , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) tte Air Fleet Reich at Wansee , west of Berlin . We were responsible for the defense of Germany both night and day , and it was a job full of problems , I can tell you ! In August , I asked my friend and superior Adolf Galland , who was general of fighters , to give me a command somewhere at the front-I could not take Hitter and GOring anymore . Galland understood . In September 1944 , 1 became JagdfliegerJiihrer Flight Leader Balkan , in charge of fighter defense over an area that included Greece , Romania , Bulgaria and Yugoslavia . The radar systems in Greece to the Peloponnesus were within my " empire " as well . I was situated at Pancevo near Belgrade . This job was important , but it did not last long . In October 1944 , all of the fighter units were withdrawn to the home defense of Germany proper , and during that short period , we had constant trouble with partisans and the Russians . As the war closed in on us , we retreated toward Vienna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When did you get the Knight 's Cross ? Falck : GOring awarded me the Knight 's Cross on October 1 , 1940 . NM : How were the night fighters chosen ? Falck : In the beginning I visited the destroyer school . There I created a report on the standards for night fighters , and several pilots came forward . The best men came from the bomber units , including Major Hajo Herrmann , who developed free-hunting Wilde Sau " wild sow " tactics . Our night fighter force was impressive-working through Intelligence , radar and flak commands , we had our intercept monitors and search reporting service with radar for all of them . There was never at any time any mention of the high-frequency radar warit was all too new . That was when I was transfer-red to the Luftwaffe Command Central in Berlin . XM : You knew men such as Prince Heinrich zu Sayn Wittgenstein , Helmut Lent , Hans-Joachim Jabs and Heinz Wolfgang Schnauffer . What was your opinion of them ? Falck : Well , you 've just mentioned the best pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Wittgenstein was a nobleman , but not a national socialist . He fought for Germany as had his family for 500 years , and he was quite successful and a true gentleman , as were all of them . He was killed in the war , as was Helmut Lent , who won the Diamonds and had at least 110 victories ( 102 of which were at night ) . Hans Jabs is still a good friend of mine and finished the war with the Oak Leaves and 50 victories , and the best was Schnauffer with 121 kills , all at night . Schnauffer died in France in July 1950 in an automobile accident , a tragic way to go . He also held the Diamonds . All of them were under my command , and all were outstanding persons , full of idealism and first-rate hunters and great pilots . They were very distinguished people , strong-willed and very ambitious , but in a good sense . They were highly intelligent , with immediate responses to crises , untiring and happiest when they were on flight operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but very reliable , and I was proud to have known them . MH : Describe atypical night fighter mission . Falck : The night fighter faced many dangers that the day fighter was fortunate not to have . We did not have to contend with escort fighters , as did the day fighter force later in the war , but we had to worry about our own flak , collision with our own planes as well as the enemy bombers , the flares dropped by the British planes to blind us ( which would also illuminate your plane , allowing the gunners to shoot you down ) , the possibility of your on-board radar not working ( which left you blind ) , and flying across the sky locating the black-painted aircraft . I think night fighting worked on the nerves more than fighting during the day-all of those unknowns would mentally wear you down . NM : What were some of your most interesting combat missions ? Photograph Major Falck exchanges smiles with Captain Werner Strieb ( left ) of 21NJG.2 , who shot down an ArmstrongWhitworth Whitley over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me- I 10 's first night victory . // Falck : My most interesting and dangerous missions were , of course , against the RAE Later on , after a total of 90 combat missions , I was given the order by my boss that I was not to fly combat any longer , because I was needed for the planning and development of the defense organization . Nffl : How did the people and their attitudes change as the war dragged on ? Falck- After World War 1 , inflation was outrageous and there was no work-it was terrible . When the National Socialists came to power , suddenly there were jobs , industry increased , building of homes and cities was undertaken , and the armaments industry created millions of jobs-and , of course , the resurgence of the military improved life as well . What we know today about the concentration camps and such was unknown to most of us , even those in high military positions . That does not excuse what happened , but it should be mentioned that it was not a well-known , collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused their power in the name of the German people and had nothing to do with the true soldiers , the professionals . NM : How did the war end for you ? Falck : The war ended for me in Bavaria on May 2 , 1945 , when I became a prisoner of war of the U.S. Army . That time in the prison camp was more than terrible , but it was thankfully short . I again had great luck-the son of a Jewish banker from Berlin , whose father was a former army officer from World War 1 , was the commander of our camp and responsible for the discharges of prisoners of war . Yet in spite of the standing Allied order that all general staff officers were to be banished for life somewhere else , he duplicated all the neccssary stamps and signatures and discharged me on June 7 . Otherwise , I would have spent several years writing war history in a prison camp in England or the United States somewhere . We became close personal friends and visited each other sometimes in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1993 . MH : How was life for you after the war ? Falck : To begin with , bad ! No one dared hire a war criminal , as all of us were labeled . I tried to become a night guard in a factory to make enough money to survive , but I did not get that job . Germans did not dare employ me , even with all of my certificates and qualifications , curriculum vitae , etc. , but the British Army of the Rhine must have had certain information about me . They hired me as a civil officer in 1946 for a series of 47 stores riot far from Bielefeld . I asked the major , " Do you know who I am ? " He answered yes and said that he knew I had been a colonel in the Luftwaffe and had the Knight 's Cross . He said that they were looking for people they could trust and were reliable . So I became the boss of 145 German labor employees . My boss was a captain , and we became good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradesmen and after some time I passed the examination . In 1948 , 1 joined a German company that was a branch of the medical and pharmaceutical industry , and after some further education I became a businessman . After that I changed over to a large printing press company , which had started to produce playing cards . I started out as a lowly office employee , being promoted year after year until I finally became the manager of that company . NM : But at some point you got back in the aviation field ? FaIck : In 1961 , a high-level employer with the North American Aircraft Company in Los Angeles asked me during a meeting of international fighter pilots to join his company as a consultant in Germany . That was my chance to return to my old world , and I did that for six years until McDonnellDouglas asked me to join them in the same capacity . I was very busy in Bonn for the next 20 years , working for McDonnellDouglas until I was 75 years old . Since my retirement in 1986 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy life in this beautiful countryside . This is the most beautiful part of Austria . MH : What do you think of the new technology of today 's night fighting aircraft ? Falck : Today there is no difference between night fighter and day fighter aircraft anymore . They see each other with radar and thermal imagery , and they can engage each other without a pilot seeing his target . You can not compare the aerial warfare of today with the primitive methods we used in World War 11 . MH : What advice would you give the young people of today ? Falck : Be grateful that we are living in relative peace , that you have a home and do not suffer from hunger . Take over the responsibility for your family and your country , be tolerant of everyone , stay honest and busy , and took forward to what you intend to do with your life . Always have a target and make sure that what you are fighting for is worthwhile . Life is short ! Ei For further reading , Wilmington , N.C.-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luftwaffe , by Raymond F.
