<p> After retiring at age 66 , the old man abandoned his beloved South Boston for a lengthy vacation . <p> James " Whitey " Bulger had little alternative . Even if he stayed , the one-time head of Boston 's notorious Winter Hill mob was going away for a long time . <p> It was January 1995 , and the nation 's last great Irish gangster faced indictment for the first time in three decades . A racketeering and extortion conviction would guarantee Bulger 's death behind bars . <p> And then , before the feds moved in , poof ! Whitey Bulger vanished . <p> Six years later , he remains at large - a life on the lam that has both destroyed and remade his reputation . In absentia , Whitey Bulger has gone from stand-up guy to running man , from local Robin Hood to simple murderous hood . <p> Bulger , the lone senior citizen on the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted List , is now linked to 18 murders . The balding , bespectacled fugitive has logged a record six appearances on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and an associate were charged with killing businessmen in Florida and Oklahoma ; now , he could face the death penalty . <p> There 's a $1 million bounty on his head ; fellow FBI fugitives in his league include international terrorist Osama Bin Laden and alleged Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph . <p> But neither of them ever shared a glass of wine with FBI agents , as Bulger did while serving as both federal informant and mob boss for some 20 years . And neither of them fled after receiving a tip from one of those agents , as Bulger allegedly did . <p> The FBI man , fellow Southie native John Connolly , has pleaded innocent to his own racketeering charges . <p> Bulger , at age 71 , remains two things : a free man and a source of embarrassment to FBI officials , who fight a perception in Boston that their pursuit of Bulger lacks a certain ... enthusiasm . <p> " There 's still a huge debate about whether the FBI is sincere in its efforts to catch Whitey , " says Dick Lehr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book on Bulger 's reign . <p> Michael Davis , whose sister was one of Bulger 's alleged victims , has waited 19 years for the arrest of her killer . He complained last year when investigators stopped digging for bodies at a suburban mob graveyard without finding his sister Debbie 's remains . <p> " I just think they dug where they were pointed at , " he complained , citing an informant 's tip as opposed to any police work . His sister 's body was eventually found in October , buried in a shallow grave on the banks of the Neponset River in Quincy . <p> FBI officials acknowledge the stepped-up Bulger manhunt - the reward was bumped to seven figures in November - is part law enforcement , part public relations . <p> " A group of people out there believe we do n't want to find him . It 's certainly not the truth , " says Supervisory Special Agent Tom Cassano of the Boston office . The search , he says , is the most intensive of his 30-year career . <p> The truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carve his notoriety , is somewhere out there , financed by a national network of safe deposit boxes , each loaded with cash by Bulger in the late 1970s . <p> Unlike recidivist mobsters such as Sammy " The Bull " Gravano , Bulger lives clean . Traveling with longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig , he avoids the single misstep that could land him in jail . <p> His double life as mobster/snitch , coupled with his long flight from justice , is the stuff of movies . Already , Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are mentioned as possible leads . <p> " Bulger had an image that was mythic , " Lehr says . " What 's fascinating to me is the FBI 's role in creating and perpetuating that myth . " <p> In recent years , Bulger employed a variety of aliases : Thomas Baxter , Mark Shapeton , Tom Harris - the last a possible homage to the author who dreamed up elusive mass murderer Hannibal Lecter ( Bulger 's wanted poster pops up briefly in the film " Hannibal . " ) . <p> But Bulger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did time on The Rock - Alcatraz penitentiary - before returning to his native Boston and a life of crime . <p> Arrested first at age 17 , Bulger developed a fearsome reputation among the Irish and Italian gangs that shared Boston 's organized crime . The blond-haired thug ran with a gang called the Shamrocks . <p> " They 're all the same , " a Massachusetts state trooper once said of the local mobsters , " except some of them have their o 's at the beginning of their name , and some have o 's at the end . " <p> Bulger 's Alcatraz stay , part of a nine-year federal rap , was his last trip behind bars . <p> When Bulger returned to Southie in 1965 , his brother Billy was the local state senator , helped into office by volunteers like John Connolly . Billy , who later became Senate president , now heads the University of Massachusetts . <p> Whitey followed a similar arc in his disparate career . He fell in with the Winter Hill gang , the Gaelic equivalent of a Mafia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulger reputedly sprayed him with machine-gun fire - Whitey ascended . <p> Despite the violence , Bulger was often viewed as a benevolent rogue , as likely to buy a local kid an ice cream cone as to break somebody 's head . Southie 's own Robin Hood , folks in the insular neighborhood liked to say . <p> That would change . <p> In the fall of 1975 , Bulger was recruited as an informant by a hotshot FBI agent - his brother 's ex-campaign volunteer , Connolly . They first met at midnight on Wollaston Beach near Southie . It was , prosecutors say , the meeting that changed everything . <p> Connolly had recruited a TE , a " top echelon " informant in FBI-speak , and he would protect his snitch . Within a year , authorities now say , Connolly accepted a bribe from Bulger : a diamond ring . By the end of 1976 , an FBI informant was allegedly killed after Connolly tipped Bulger about the turncoat . <p> A pattern was established , authorities said : Bulger alerted Connolly to the crooked activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to put him in jail . <p> " This was not a bank robbery , or bribing a public official one time , " Lehr says . " This is a history that spans the next 20 years . " <p> Over those two decades , according to federal indictments , the alliance turned Bulger into Boston 's most powerful mobster and Connolly into an FBI star . <p> Bulger and sidekick Steve " The Rifleman " Flemmi enjoyed a certain criminal carte blanche : shakedowns , extortion , drug deals , murder upon murder upon murder - all without prosecution , authorities said . Connolly 's tips to Bulger and Flemmi about three informants allegedly boosted the body count . All were later killed . <p> Their partnership ended when Connolly allegedly alerted Bulger to the impending 1995 indictment . Six years later , the FBI agent stands charged as just another Southie gangster , accused of racketeering , conspiracy and obstruction of justice . He remains free on bail , awaiting his trial . <p> It took until last year , with an informant 's help , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skeletal remains of a man buried a few hundred yards from Bulger 's old home , were dug up . <p> The alleged Bulger-Connolly connection remains a touchy subject in the Boston FBI office . " We ca n't talk about all the ongoing stuff , " says Gail Marcinkiewicz , a spokesperson . <p> Yet Bulger 's presence still lingers . Opposite the sixth-floor elevators in the FBI office , his wanted poster stares out from the wall . <p> The coming indictment sent Bulger south to New York City . Once there , he dumped his old identity and became a new man : Thomas Barrett . <p> Like Bonnie and Clyde on Geritol - or in his case , the heart medication Atenolol - Whitey and Catherine stay on the move . Sightings have come in from Louisiana , Mississippi , California , Wyoming , Iowa , Florida , New York . Tips still arrive daily . <p> In the summer of 1996 , he slipped police in a New York City suburb . That same year , he visited a New Orleans bank and emerged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The thing that 's unique about Bulger is that he 's got sufficient funds to stay out of trouble , " says Cassano . How much ? If Bulger is apprehended and convicted , he faces forfeiture of $10 million in assets . <p> Henry Wellman was Bulger 's landlord for six weeks in 1996 , unwittingly setting the fugitive up in a two-bedroom apartment in the small fishing town of Grande Isle , La . <p> " Just an elderly guy with his wife , the grandfather type , " Wellman recalls . " A nice guy , stayed to himself . " <p> Bulger complained about the heat , went for nightly walks , and left as quietly as he arrived . Weeks later , Wellman and wife , Barbara , were visited by the local chief of police . The FBI , he said , had questions about their tenants . Seemed the man was the head of Boston 's Irish mafia . <p> Wellman recalls his response : " You got ta be kidding me . " <p> Bulger 's abandoned car , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey . Where Bulger headed from there was anyone 's guess . <p> It took four years for the next confirmed sighting : February 2000 in Fountain Valley , Calif , where Catherine had some work done at a local beauty parlor as Bulger waited in a car . That trail , too , went cold . <p> Whitey Bulger needs no disguise now . <p> Traveling with Catherine , who turns 50 next month , he sports sunglasses and a baseball cap . The once-feared gangster looks more grandfather than godfather , just another anonymous senior citizen . <p> " Go down to Florida , " Cassano says dolefully , " and you 'll see thousands of them . " <p> Despite Bulger 's amazing success , the odds of an arrest still favor the FBI . Since 1950 , 458 criminals have made the 10 Most Wanted list . All but 29 were eventually taken into custody - an arrest rate of 94 percent . <p> Just last month , Oklahoma officials announced that they believed Bulger might be frequenting gay establishments and nudist colonies . They also said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left him with permanent bad breath . <p> While on the run , Bulger has tried to resurrect his Robin Hood role . The FBI has tales of Bulger buying appliances for acquaintances made on the road , or springing for a pet 's visit to the veterinarian . <p> Back in Boston , that image is forever lost . His crime spree far outpaces the work of " Boston Strangler " Albert DeSalvo , who killed 11 . He 's accused of poisoning his beloved neighborhood with drugs . He killed with impunity . He turned on his friends . <p> " He was mythic . He was rock solid , the ultimate stand-up guy . And now he 's a rat . He 's been exposed , " Lehr says . <p> " The myth of Whitey Bulger is totally shattered now . " <p> End Adv for Release Sunday , March 25 , and Thereafter <p>
