Terry Bisson 's first fable about young Billy appeared in our Oct/Nov 2005 issue . In that one , he battled ants . Now he encounters a fairy . What will it be next ? Spacemen ? Unicorns ? The President ? Stay tuned ! <p> " THERE 'S SOMETHING IN MY room , " said Billy . " I think it 's a fairy . " " Fairies are make-believe , " said Billy 's mother . " It glows in the dark , " said Billy . " Go back to bed , " said Billy 's father . Billy 's bed was shaped like a race car . There was a little tiny person sitting on the front of the bed , beside the steering wheel . " Are you a fairy ? " Billy asked . " Who wants to know ? " " Me . It 's my room . " " So what , " said the fairy . Billy thought about that . " Are you really a fairy ? " he asked . " Are you really a little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're a stupid little boy .

" " I never said that . I 'm really a fairy , but I 'm not a real fairy . Real fairies are make-believe . I 'm not make-believe . " " Make-believe stuff is stupid , " said Billy , getting into bed . " Why are n't you wearing any pants ? " " Fairies do n't have to . Who is that on your pajamas ? " " Dale Earnhardt . He 's a race car driver . " " He looks like your father , " said the fairy . " Are n't you supposed to sleep with your head at this end ? " " I 'm afraid of you , " said Billy . " Suit yourself , " said the fairy .

" Just do n't confuse it with reality . " " Huh ? " said Billy . " And do n't forget those leaves , " said Billy 's father , getting up to go . Billy picked up the leaves out of the driveway . It was his only chore . When he was finished , he went to his room . He was hoping to talk to the fairy but the fairy was gone . There was a wet spot by the steering wheel , where it had sat .

It 's shaped like a race car . " " You can sit on it , " Billy said . " But I wish you would wear pants . " The next morning , the fairy was gone . There was a wet spot on Billy 's bed . " What if there was just one fairy ? " Billy asked at breakfast . " Would that be make-believe ? " " Of course , " said Billy 's mother . " Every child has a right to a little make-believe .

" " " He does n't do things , " said Billy . " First Billy picked up the leaves , then he went to his room . The fairy was sitting on his bed , next to the steering wheel . " What do fairies do ? " asked Billy . " Nothing much , " said the fairy . " Sometimes we kill people . " " Huh ? " " When God wants a new angel in Heaven , sometimes He sends a fairy down to kill him . Or her . " " Are you here to kill me ? " " Of course not , " said the fairy . Billy thought about that . " My mom does n't believe in fairies , " he said . " So what . " " So she says you are just make-believe . That 's what . " " That 's because she 's stupid . " " My mom 's not stupid . " " That 's what you think , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " he said .

" " Please , Mom , " said Billy . Billy 's mother wiped her hands and followed him into his bedroom . The fairy was gone . But that was okay . " Look , Mom ! " said Billy . He showed her the wet spot on the bed . " That 's where it was sitting . " " Billy , " said Billy 's mother . " Billy 's growing up , " said Billy 's mother at dinner . " Good . Then maybe he can do what he 's told , " said Billy 's father . " Like pick up the leaves out of the driveway . " " But I did , " said Billy . " Sir . " " Sir .

" And I wish you would wear pants . " " Fairies do n't have to wear pants . Dale said to tell you hello . " " No , he did n't . " " You 're right , he did n't , " said the fairy . " Dead people do n't say hello . I did see him , though . " " Where ? In Heaven ? " The fairy laughed . It made a nasty little tinkling sound .

" " Go back to sleep , Billy . " Billy went back to sleep . . . " How 's your fairy doing ? " Billy 's mother asked at breakfast . " Is it still there ? " " Sometimes , " Billy said . " Maybe he can help you pick up the leaves out of the driveway before I get home , " said Billy 's father . " He does n't do things , " said Billy . " I told you . " " Sir . " " Sir .

" " Do you really kill people ? " asked Billy . He was getting ready for bed . " You already asked me that , " said the fairy . " Who do you want me to kill ? " Billy thought about that . " My father , " he said . The next morning , Billy 's father slumped over at the breakfast table . " Oh dear , " said Billy 's mother . He was dead . The ambulance came and got him . " That was cool , " said Billy that night as he was putting on his pajamas . " But I did n't see any long needle . " " Of course not , " said the fairy . The next day , the fairy killed Billy 's mother . She slumped over and her face went into the pie . This time , Billy saw the long needle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its little legs were crossed .

" I still do n't have anybody to take care of me , " he said . " Clean up the pie , " said the fairy . " I 'll ask around . " That night there was no supper . Billy got a box of cereal and took it to his room . Dale Earnhardt was sitting on the bed . " Out of the box , " he said . " Classy . " " I thought you were dead , " said Billy .

He looked around for the fairy , but the fairy was gone . There was only a wet spot where it once had been .
