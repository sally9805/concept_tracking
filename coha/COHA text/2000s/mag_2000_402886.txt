<p> Their bedside manner is a tad impersonal . But the computer-assisted robotic systems finding their way into today 's operating room may someday save your life . <p> In the state-of-the-art hospital operating room , 67-year-old Eugene Bern lies anesthetized , pierced through the chest by three narrow , stainless-steel rods held by aluminum and plastic mechanical arms draped in translucent vinyl . Under way in the operating room is a critical portion of a heart bypass operation , but missing is the customary crowd of surgeons around the patient . Instead , in a corner across the room , a cardiac surgeon sits alone at a computer , his back to the operating table . Hunched over an enveloping , streamlined console , his feet tapping at pedal switches and fingers rapidly manipulating sensitive handheld controllers , the doctor in surgical scrubs could pass for some silent-movie mad scientist at his mighty Wurlitzer organ . <p> In fact , it 's a day this past summer at New York 's Beth Israel Medical Center , and cardiac surgeon Hani Shennib is offering a preview into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his patient 's chest cavity via a tiny video camera mounted at the end of one of the three steel rods , the surgeon performs the delicate task of harvesting a chest artery to be used in a heart bypass graft . Still at the console , Shennib grasps , cuts and cauterizes using surgical instruments on the tips of the other two rods ; the instruments , deep in the patient 's chest , respond precisely to the physician 's hand movements , which are relayed via a computer to the electromechanical arms . <p> Welcome to the future of the operating room . The computer-mediated part of this heart operation is still under clinical testing pending approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . But just a few days prior to the Beth Israel procedure , the FDA approved the commercial sale of the computer-controlled robotics for abdominal laparoscopic surgery as well as minimally invasive gallbladder , prostate , colorectal and esophageal procedures  --  potentially 3.5 million operations a year in the United States . <p> With more than 50 advanced robotic systems already in hospitals around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe and are in clinical trials in Japan ) , the robot-assisted operating room of tomorrow is just around the corner for many patients . Indeed , the cascade of robotic surgery " firsts " proclaimed by hospitals in the United States and abroad became a torrent after the FDA 's initial commercial approval . <p> The day after the FDA announcement , for example , Henrico Doctors ' Hospital in Richmond , Va. , publicized the first non-clinical-trial use of robotic surgery for a gallbladder removal ; the operation was performed by surgeon William E. Kelley with a da Vinci system on 35-year-old Kimberly Briggs . To demonstrate just how nontraumatic the procedure could be , less than four hours after her operation was over Briggs was wheeled into a press conference , where she told reporters , " I feel great . " <p> The potential advantages of the robotic systems are dramatic . The robotic arm positions and holds the video camera with greater accuracy and steadiness than any human being could . Seated comfortably instead of standing over the patient , the surgeon is less subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can last many hours . Should there be a tremor in the surgeon 's hand , as there could be during a long operation , the computer filters it out . There 's an expression for this robotic version of a steady hand : " virtual stillness . " <p> The technology also holds the promise of making minimally invasive operations , in which surgery is performed through small incisions , available to a far larger group of patients . Minimally invasive techniques mean less trauma for the patient and have become common for such operations as gallbladder removal . In today 's more conventional version of minimally invasive surgery , long-stemmed , narrow instruments are directly controlled by the surgeon ; it 's somewhat like using chopsticks to perform surgery . Because of the special training required and limits to its applicability , this form of surgery is practiced by fewer than one-third of U.S. surgeons . Thanks to computer-assisted procedures that are more exact and reproducible , a new generation of minimally invasive techniques could make less trauma for the patient the norm rather than the exception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the surgeon is able to spare the patient the trauma and pain involved in cracking open the breastbone and using a heart-lung pump while the heart is stopped . In fact , Beth Israel heart patient Bem was released the next day instead of after the week-long hospital stay ( at $1,400 per day ) that is routine following open-heart surgery . Hearts of Gold <p> Medical regulators in the federal government share the increasing enthusiasm for robotically assisted surgery . In approving the million-dollar da Vinci system made by Intuitive Surgical of Mountain View , Calif. , the FDA gave the technology a verbal pat on the chassis . " This system is the first step in the development of new robotic technology that eventually could change the practice of surgery , " said FDA Commissioner Jane E. Henney . At the same time , the FDA notified Intuitive Surgical 's chief rival , Computer Motion in Goleta , Calif. , that robotic surgery devices will be cleared for market release on an accelerated basis . This makes it likely that Computer Motion 's $750,000 ZEUS Robotic Surgical System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some procedures by sometime next year . ( Like all medical devices , robotic surgery equipment must be approved by the FDA separately for each type of procedure . ) <p> When it comes to robot-assisted surgery , however , the performance of cardiac procedures is the Holy Grail . More than 400,000 open-heart surgeries are performed each year in the United States , at a cost of nearly $20 billion . Both lifesaving and expensive ( typically $25,000 per operation ) , open-heart coronary bypass surgery is often referred to as the " gold standard " by practitioners and hospital administrators . <p> Cardiac surgeons say the looming presence of robotics in the operating room could revolutionize the operations . " The integration of computers and robotics will have as great an impact as the introduction of anesthesiology into the operating room , " said heart surgeon Ralph Damiano Jr. , speaking at the recent Fourth International Congress on Computers and Robotics in the Operating Room , in Santa Barbara , Calif . At the same time , Damiano , who in 1998 was the first physician in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the technology alone is not enough to guarantee widescale adoption of the techniques ; operating-room economics apply too . <p> The challenge is to demonstrate that , in addition to reducing operating overhead with fewer personnel in the operating room and shorter patient hospital stays , robotic surgery will also result in improved outcomes over current methods , attracting even more patients . By focusing on heart operations , the manufacturers of the new surgical equipment are banking on this becoming the earliest area of wide adoption  --  and for good reason . According to Jan Wald , senior vice president for equity research at George K. Baum &; Co. , " the profit margin for hospitals is very low , only about 2.5 percent  --  no more than what supermarkets make . But cardiac surgery is very profitable ; it 's a big moneymaker in any hospital . " Hence the anticipated market for high-priced , high-tech computer-assisted cardiac surgery systems , which are second in cost only to magnetic resonance imaging and other sophisticated medical imaging systems in today 's bigticket capital equipment for hospitals . Robo Duels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence that Beth Israel 's and New York University 's medical centers are among the facilities most aggressively pursuing the technology in cardiac surgery . " New York is one of the most competitive markets for heart care in the hospital business , " says Richard Gemming , executive director of the Heart Institute for Continuum Health Partners Inc. , which runs Beth Israel and a half-dozen other formerly independent hospitals in the vicinity . Due to consolidation and a New York State medical regulatory system that limits the number of cardiac centers , a few operating rooms must vie for the area 's large and sophisticated patient population ; if a healthcare facility falls below a mandated number of operations necessary to maintain surgical expertise , the hospital can lose its cardiac approval . <p> In this atmosphere of intense competition , it 's also not surprising that Beth Israel and NYU are adopting rival equipment  --  da Vinci and ZEUS systems . In principle , the hardware is similar , consisting of a computer-mediated surgical workstation with a high-quality video display and hand-input devices , a wired network to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system 's robotic arms . In practice , however , da Vinci and ZEUS differ in crucial ways . <p> By design , da Vinci 's console is meant to be immersive : The surgeon looks down at a three-dimensional view of the patient 's innards , as picked up by a two-chip charge-coupled device ( the same type of chip used in digital cameras ) video element in the scope at the end of one of the stainless-steel rods . To assure a topnotch , stereoscopic , nonfatiguing view , mirrors reflect images from two full-sized monitors , hidden within the bulky console , into the left and right eyepieces of the visor port . <p> By contrast , the ZEUS console is more like a computer workstation : The surgeon sits opposite a vertical screen  --  available with 3-D stereo imaging using lightweight polarizing glasses . An in-depth display , it turns out , may not be as crucial as the subtle color cues available from monocular high-definition video , especially at 10 times magnification , which is beyond the augmentation afforded by simple optics worn by a nonrobotically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of high-quality displays make it possible to see anatomical features in precise detail . " You can see anatomical structures you 've never seen before , " says NYU 's Eugene Grossi ; as director of the hospital 's cardiovascular research laboratory he was responsible for adding a Sony high-definition TV system to the ZEUS equipment . Says Beth Israel 's Shennib of his da Vinci console : " It 's the best medical visualization I 've ever seen . " <p> Beyond the displays , other key differences can be found in the systems ' hand controllers and coupled robotic arms and instruments . ZEUS replicates the endoscopic instrumentation used in conventional minimally invasive surgery . ( An endoscope is a slender optical tube passed into the body to allow the surgeon to view an operation . ) The surgeon activates the long-stemmed chopstick-like instruments by compressing V-shaped handles . This control device , though perhaps not as intuitive as other types , involves a set of manipulations to which practitioners of minimally invasive surgery are already accustomed . <p> The da Vinci system adds another wristlike articulation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hand controllers . " It provides better dexterity . The motion is close to having your hand inside the patient , " says Shennib . But not exactly . The da Vinci 's force feedback , a computer-synthesized tactile resistance felt by the surgeon when making an incision or sewing a suture , provides a cue to instruments ' actions but does n't accurately replicate what is sensed in handson work . According to Shennib , " You feel resistance from the robotic arms when you 're pushing on the controls , but not the delicate feedback of pulling or pushing on tissue . " Grinding to a Start <p> While cardiac surgery at two of Manhattan 's leading medical centers may be the high-profile payoff of robotic surgery today , the technology 's roots are less glamorous . Incorporating robotics into surgical procedures began at academic institutions including MIT , the Carnegie-Mellon Institute and several campuses of the University of California . In 1986 , the University of California at Davis and IBM 's Thomas J. Watson Research Center joined forces to begin development of computer-assisted hip replacement surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Integrated Surgical Systems , introduced the Robodoc Surgical Assistant System . <p> The job of this robotic system is to grind away bone . At best , conventional surgical techniques leave gaps of 1 millimeter or more between bone and implant , but no more than 0.5 millimeters of bone will grow out from a cut bone . The insurmountable space eventually leads to implant failure . Milling bone with greater precision than an experienced surgeon could , Robodoc assures that a cementless prosthesis can achieve long-term fixation by allowing bone to grow into the porous coating of the implant . In fact , this March , Integrated Surgical reported that Robodoc had been used for the first total knee replacement performed using robotic surgery . <p> But grinding down hips and knees does n't fire the public imagination like mending an ailing heart . With the goal of aiding in complex procedures such as heart operations , companies developing robotics have come up with increasingly sophisticated systems . In 1994 , Computer Motion produced the first FDA-cleared robot for assisting surgery in the operating room  --  the Automated Endoscopic System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electromechanical arm for positioning an endoscope . Two years later , voice control by the surgeon was added , allowing for exact , hands-free control during an operation . In 1998 , Computer Motion introduced ZEUS , its robotic surgery system capable of operating on everything from an ailing heart to an inflamed gallbladder . <p> Rival technology underlying Intuitive Surgical 's da Vinci system grew up around the same time , financed by government funding for research in " telesurgery "  --  computer-assisted medical procedures delivered at a distance . In the early 1990s , SRI International in Menlo Park , Calif. , was one of several institutions receiving grants from the Department of Defense 's Advanced Research Projects Agency to develop tele-surgery . A prototype system was built and proved an inspiration to Frederic Moll , who cofounded Intuitive Surgical in 1995 and is now the company 's medical director . " What got me excited was n't the remote-surgery aspect , " Moll recalls , " but the way the system eliminated the need for a hand to be directly connected to a surgeon 's instruments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasive techniques . " Doctors on Call <p> While research into tele-surgery helped to jump-start robotics in the operating room , distant operations have remained an elusive application . However , it may eventually prove to be one of the most significant uses of robotic surgery . <p> With either da Vinci or ZEUS , a surgeon seated across the room from the patient could as readily be operating from another room down the hall or from an office across town . Without having to spend hours traveling and prepping for each surgery , a specialist could perform procedures in several different operating rooms scattered throughout a region on the same day . At least that 's the theory . In practice , there are limits , including ones caused by what can be a disorienting lag time between a surgeon 's hand motions and the robotic arms ' actions . Due to transmission delays over longer distances , the maximum effective range seems to be about 30 miles by wireless communication and 200 miles via a cable connection . The unreliability of network communication infrastructures presents even more of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Center one morning this August , surgeon Stephen Colvin is operating on the heart of a 56-year-old woman to repair a damaged mitral valve . The physician is working by hand with endoscopic instruments , while invoking robotic help to position the scope that is relaying the close-up view to a video monitor hanging above the patient . " AESOP ! " he says . There 's a trill of acknowledgment from the machine . " Move back . Up . Up . " The scope moves to the proper orientation . <p> In the hallway outside the operating room , Grossi leads an audiovisual team televising the operation via satellite uplink to a medical conference in Montana . Eventually , interns and doctors at remote teaching venues could experience the actual surgical motions of their world-class colleagues on force-feedback-equipped simulators . At the moment , however , maintaining video communications is a difficult enough challenge . At the operation 's most critical phase , the TV signal is lost on the downlink in Montana . ( A burst of radiation from a microwave oven on the conference 's premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tele-surgery may not yet be ready for prime time , it 's only a temporary setback . Next time , the physicians will use broadband telephone lines to secure a steady transmission link . And soon they expect to televise a complete robotically assisted surgery . In such increments , tele-mentoring and tele-surgery will advance  --  further accelerating development of computer-enhanced procedures . It will take significant improvements in communications networks , but in perhaps the not too distant future , an accident victim on a rural highway in Nebraska , or a heart patient in an isolated village in France , could have remote access to care by the finest world-class surgeons at major medical facilities . <p> With the enabling technology for robotic surgery already making an impact in the operating room , it 's just a matter of time before a surgical star " phoning in " a complicated procedure is a routine event in the operating room . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 1 The da Vinci robotic apparatus waits in the operating room prior to a minimally invasive procedure for a patient with gastroesophageal reflux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses hook up the endoscope , which uses twin cameras , to the video monitoring system . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 3 One of the robotic arms , equipped with the narrow surgical instrument . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 4 A nurse drapes the robotic platform with sterile covering . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 5 Finally ready for surgery , the robotic apparatus patiently awaits the patient . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 6 Three robotic arms , equipped with cameras and surgical instruments , carry out the procedure through small incisions in the patient 's abdomen . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 7 The " real " surgeon , William Kelley , manipulates the surgical instruments from a console in the corner of the OR . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 8 Nurses follow the procedure on a video monitor . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 9 Nurses are ready to make any needed adjustments . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 10 The surgeon guides the robotic instruments from the console . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleviate hand tremors . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Remote remedy : At New York 's Beth Israel Medical Center , a surgeon performs a heart operation sitting at a computer console . <p> By Steve Ditlea <p>
