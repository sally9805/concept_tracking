Piebalds The Piebalds always claimed only to want freedom from the persecution that has been the lot of the Witted folk of the Six Duchies for generations . This claim can be dismissed as both a lie and a clever deceit . The Piebalds wanted power . Their intent was to mold all of the Witted folk of the Six Duchies into a united force that would rise up to seize control of the monarchy and put their own people into power . One facet of their ploy was to claim that all kings since the abdication of Chivalry were pretenders , that the bastardy of FitzChivalry Farseer was wrongly construed as an obstacle to his inheriting the throne . Legends of the " True-hearted Bastard " rising from the grave to serve King Verity in his quest proliferated beyond all common sense , ascribing powers to FitzChivalry that raised the Bastard to the status of a near-deity . For this reason , the Piebalds have also been known as the Cult of the Bastard . These ridiculous claims were intended to give some sort of legitimacy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their own on the throne . To this end , the Piebalds began a clever campaign of forcing the Witted to either unite with them or risk exposure . Perhaps this tactic was inspired by Kebal Rawbread , leader of the Outislanders during the Red Ship War , for it is said that he drew men to follow him , not by his charisma , but by fear of what he would do to their homes and families if they refused to fall in with his plans . The Piebalds ' technique was a simple one . Either families tainted with the Wit magic joined their alliance or they were exposed by public accusations that led to their execution . Itis said that the Piebalds often began an insidious attack on the fringes of a powerful family , exposing first a servant or a less affluent cousin , all the while making it clear that if the head of the stalwart house did not comply with their wishes , he too would eventually meet such an end . This is not the action of folk who wish to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act of a ruthless faction determined to gain power for themselves , first by subjugating their own kind .  - -  rowell 's " the piebald conspiracy " The watch had changed . The town watchman 's bell and cry came thin through the storm , but I heard it . Night had officially ended and we were venturing toward morning and still I sat in Jinna 's cottage waiting for Hap to return . Jinna and I shared the comfort of her cozy hearth . Jinna 's niece had come in some time ago and chatted with us briefly before she sought her bed . Jinna and I passed the time , feeding log after log to the fire and gossiping of inconsequential things . The hedge-witch 's little house was warm and pleasant , her company congenial , and waiting for my boy became an excuse that allowed me to do what I wished , which was simply to sit quietly where I was . Conversation had been sporadic . Jinna had asked how my errand had gone . I had replied that it had been my master 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from sounding too brusque , I added that Lord Golden had acquired some feathers for his collection and then chatted to her about Myblack . I knew Jinna had no real interest in hearing about my horse , but she listened amiably . The words filled the small space between us comfortably . In truth , our real errand had had nothing to do with feathers , and had been more mine than Lord Golden 's . Together , we had recovered Prince Dutiful from the Piebalds who had first befriended and then captured him . We had returned him to Buckkeep with none of his nobles the wiser . Tonight the aristocracy of the Six Duchies feasted and danced , and tomorrow they would formalize Prince Dutiful 's betrothal to the Outisland Narcheska Elliania . Outwardly , all was as it had been . Few would ever know how much the seamless continuation of their normality had cost the Prince and me . The Prince 's Wit cat had sacrificed her life for him . I had lost my wolf . For close to a score of years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half my soul . Now he was gone . It was as profound a change in my life as the snuffing of a lamp makes in an evening room . His absence seemed a solid thing , a burden I must carry in addition to my grief . Nights were darker . No one guarded my back for me . Yet I knew I would continue to live . Sometimes that knowledge seemed the worst part of my loss . I reined back before I plunged completely into self-pity . I was not the only one who was bereaved . Despite the Prince 's briefer bond with his cat , I knew he suffered deeply . The magic link that the Wit forms between a human and an animal is a complex one . Severing it is never trivial . Yet the boy had mastered his grief and was stalwartly going through the motions of fulfilling his duties . At least I did not have to face my betrothal tomorrow night . The Prince had been plunged immediately back into his routine since we returned to Buckkeep yesterday afternoon . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tonight , he must smile and eat , make conversation , accept good wishes , dance , and appear well pleased with what fate and his mother had decreed for him . I thought of bright lights and skirling music and laughter and loud conversations . I shook my head in sympathy for him . " And what makes you shake your head like that , Tom Badgerlock ? " Jinna 's voice broke in on my introspection , and I realized that the silence had grown long . I drew a long breath and found an easy lie . " The storm shows no sign of dying , does it ? I was pitying those who must be out in it this night . I am grateful that I am not one of them . " " Well . To that , I 'll add that I am thankful for the company , " she said , and smiled . " And I the same , " I added awkwardly . To pass the night in the placid companionship of a pleasant woman was a novel experience for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Jinna 's hands were occupied with knitting . The cozy warmth of the firelight reflected in the auburn shades of Jinna 's curly hair and the scattering of freckles on her face and forearms . She had a good face , not beautiful , but calm and kind . Our conversation had wandered wide this evening , from the herbs she had used to make the tea to how driftwood fires sometimes burned with colored flames , and beyond to discussing ourselves . I had discovered she was about six years younger than I truly was , and she had expressed surprise when I claimed to be forty-two . That was seven years past my true age ; the extra years were part of my role as Tom Badgerlock . It pleased me when she said that she had thought I was closer to her age . Yet neither of us really gave our minds to our words . There was an interesting little tension between us as we sat before the fire and conversed quietly . The curiosity suspended between us was like a string , plucked and humming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden , I had spent an afternoon with Jinna . She had kissed me . No words had accompanied that gesture , no avowals of love or romantic compliments . There had been just the one kiss , interrupted when her niece had returned from marketing . Right now , neither of us quite knew how to return to the place where that moment of intimacy had been possible . For my part , I was not sure that I wished to venture there . I was not ready even for a second kiss , let alone what it might bring . My heart was too raw . Yet I wanted to be here , sitting before her fireside . It sounds a contradiction , and perhaps it was . I did not want the inevitable complications that caresses would lead to , yet in my Wit bereavement , I took comfort in this woman 's company . Yet Jinna was not why I had come here tonight . I needed to see Hap , my foster son . He had just arrived at Buckkeep Town and had been staying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gindast the woodworker was going well . I must also , much as I dreaded it , give him the news of Nighteyes ' death . The wolf had raised the lad as much as I had . Yet even as I winced at the thought of telling him , I hoped it would , as the Fool had said , somehow ease the burden of my sorrow . With Hap , I could share my grief , however selfish a thing that might be . Hap had been mine for the last seven years . We had shared a life , and the wolf 's companionship . If I still belonged to anyone or anything , I belonged to my boy . I needed to feel the reality of that . " More tea ? " Jinna offered me . I did not want more tea . We had already drunk three pots of it , and I had visited her backhouse twice . Yet she offered the tea to let me know I was welcome to stay , no matter how late , or early , the hour had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she set her knitting aside , to repeat the ritual of filling the kettle with fresh water from the cask and hanging it from the hook and swinging it over the fire again . Outside the storm rattled the shutters in a fresh surge of fury . Then it became , not the storm , but Hap 's rapping at the door . " Jinna ? " he called unevenly . " Are you awake still ? " " I 'm awake , " she replied . She turned from putting the kettle on . " And lucky for you that I am , or you 'd be sleeping in the shed with your pony . I 'm coming . " As she lifted the latch , I stood up , gently dumping the cat off my lap . Imbecile . The cat was comfortable . Fennel complained as he slid to the floor , but the big orange tom was too stupefied with warmth to make much of a protest . Instead he leapt onto Jinna 's chair and curled up in it without deigning me a backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved the door open . A gust of wind carried rain into the room . " Whew . Put the wood in the hole , lad , " Jinna rebuked Hap as he lurched in . Obediently he shut the door behind him and latched it , and then stood dripping before it . " It 's wild and wet out there , " he told her . His smile was beatifically drunken , but his eyes were lit with more than wine . Infatuation shone there , as unmistakable as the rain slipping from his lank hair and running down his face . It took him a moment or two to realize that I was there , watching him . Then , " Tom ! Tom , you 've finally come back ! " He flung his arms wide in a drunkard 's ebullience for the ordinary , and I laughed and stepped forward to accept his wet hug . " Do n't get water all over Jinna 's floor ! " I rebuked him . " No , I should n't . Well . I wo n't , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat . He hung it on a peg by the door and peeled off his wool cap to drip there as well . He tried to take his boots off standing , but lost his balance . He sat down on the floor and tugged them off . He leaned far to set them by the door under his wet coat and then sat up with a blissful smile . " Tom . I 've met a girl . " " Have you ? I thought you 'd met a bottle from the smell of you . " " Oh , yes , " he admitted unabashedly . " That , too . But we had to drink the Prince 's health , you know . And that of his intended . And to a happy marriage . And for many children . And for as much happiness for ourselves . " He gave me a wide and fatuous smile . " She says she loves me . She likes my eyes . " " Well . That 's good . " How many times in his life had folk looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made the sign against evil ? It had to be balm to meet a girl who found them attractive . And I suddenly knew that now was not the time to burden him with any grief of mine . I spoke gently but firmly . " I think perhaps you should go to bed , son . Wo n't your master be expecting you in the morning ? " He looked as if I had slapped him with a fish . The smile faded from his face . " Oh . Yes , yes that 's true . He 'll expect me . Old Gindast expects his apprentices to be there before his journeymen , and his journeymen to be well at work when he arrives . " He gathered himself and slowly stood up . " Tom , this apprenticeship has n't been what I expected at all . I sweep and carry boards and turn wood that is drying . I sharpen tools and clean tools and oil tools . Then I sweep again . I rub oil finishes into the completed pieces . But not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all these days . It 's all ' Watch how this is done , boy , ' or ' Repeat back what I just told you ' and ' This is n't what I asked for . Take this back to the wood stock and bring me the fine-grained cherry . And be quick about it . ' And Tom , they call me names . Country boy and dullard . " " Gindast calls all his apprentices names , Hap . " Jinna 's placid voice was both calming and comforting , but it was still strange to have a third person include herself in our conversation . " It 's common knowledge . One even took the taunt with him when he went into business for himself . Now you pay a fine price for a Simpleton table . " Jinna had moved back to her chair . She had taken up her knitting but not resumed her seat . The cat still had it . I tried not to show how much Hap 's words distressed me . I had expected to hear that he loved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get it for him . I had believed that his apprenticeship would be the one thing that had gone right . " Well . I warned you that you would have to work hard , " I attempted . " And I was ready for that , Tom , truly I was . I 'm ready to cut wood and fit it and shape it all day . But I did n't expect to be bored to death . Sweeping and rubbing and fetching . . . I might as well have stayed at home for all I 'm learning here . " Few things have such sharp edges as the careless words of a boy . His disdain for our old life , spoken so plainly , left me speechless .
