Chapter One A Fake Foreign Devil " Returnee " is a popular word nowadays in China , especially since the Chinese government called on all " patriotic overseas Chinese " to return to their homeland to build a " modern , strong China . " These returnees have a number of common traits . First , they do n't normally wear miniskirts or makeup , like so many local girls do . They often do n't look very fashionable and seem to care little about such frippery . Second , they have usually obtained advanced degrees somewhere in the West and often like to say , as casually as possible , " I went to school in Boston . " ( But they never forget to wear their Harvard or Yale rings on their fingers . ) Third , they are timid pedestrians . It takes them forever to cross an average Chinese road . Fourth , they do n't smoke . In fact , they get dizzy around smokers . Fifth , they do n't like people to ask where they come from , especially someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer , they tend to pause for several seconds as if faced with a multiple-choice question . If they were to give the traditional response , they would tell the inquirer the birthplace of their fathers ' ancestors . Knowing your ancestors ' birthplaceand tomb sites demonstrates that you have n't forgotten your roots . Anyone who forgets his roots is despised and accused of being a sell-out . In China the phrase , " He does n't know his last name anymore , " is hurled to mock those who try to forget their roots . But in the last twenty years , some Chinese scholars have claimed that China 's long history and cultural roots have impeded its modernization . For the modern Chinerse , history is just so much cultural baggage . So the new Chinese way to answer is to name the birthplace , not of your father 's ancestors but of your father . The American answer goes one step further : you simply point to your own birthplace . So this is what is going through minds of the returnees when you ask them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese , the modern Chinese , or the American model ? Or should they go one step further , and say that they come from California or London ? Well , in China , smart people leave things vague . It 's called nandehutu . Twenty-something Niuniu is one such returnee . If you 've been to Beijing , you might have seen her . She 's no different from all the other members of the trendy young xin xin renlei  --  the " new " new generation . Her hair is short , like a boy 's , and spiked up with gel , sometimes dyed red , sometimes purple . Her hands are covered with all kinds of unusual white-gold rings , with little feet , apples , skeletons , snakes , and so on . Black nails , dark brown lipstick , baggy trousers , a colorful Swiss Army watch , yellow Nokia mobile phone , palm pilot , IBM notebook , JanSport backpack , and a Louis Vuitton purse , which always holds two condoms  --  not for herself , but in case one of her girlfriends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or personal file , which is kept by the government and details their political , family , educational , and employment background . I have one , too . Let 's take a look at my dangan . Top secret .

Probably , you 've guessed by now that Niuniu is me . From my dangan , you can see why people call me a cosmopolitan woman . I love the word " cosmopolitan " as much as the drink . " Cosmopolitan " is a trendy word to toss around in China at the moment : China is building cosmopolitan megacities and luring people with a cosmopolitan background . In a country where background and history are so important , it 's increasingly popular in China to fake one 's identity , origin , and accent . For one hundred yuan , you can get a fake ID , a dangan , or a diploma from any school in the world as easily as you can pick up a fake Rolex in Shenzhen nowadays . Last week , I was in Shanghai , at a bar called CJW , owned by a friend 's friend , where several native Shanghainese were complaining about " some peasants claiming to be native Shanghainese after being here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in a Hong Kong teahouse where the waitresses bad-mouthed a chic patron carrying a black Prada bag , who had just walked out the door .
