Next to the Phoenix Theater on the century-old , brick-and-marble Melville Block , is a shop where no fewer than thirty-two tradesmen have run and subsequently closed their businesses since 1901 . The store , Write Now , sells newspapers , magazines , greeting cards , cigarettes , cigars , and candy , and is owned and operated by one of Grandville 's most attractive natives , thirty-seven-year-old Francis deVries . Easily half of Franny 's patrons drop by the shop just to chat with her and each other , buying a pack of Wrigley 's gum or a cardboard cup of coffee by way of rent for their brief daily occupancy . And virtually every one of these visitors walks in the door telling Franny how lovely she looks today . <p> As anyone in Grandville will tell you , the town has been blessed with a disproportionate number of good-looking women . A visiting Los Angeles film executive is rumored to have quipped that he spotted more knockouts passing by the corner of Melville and Main than on the corner of Hollywood and Vine . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotees whose macrobiotic diet and eurhythmic exercises appear to promote glowing , unblemished cheeks . A better bet is the even more recently arrived group of blue-eyed , blonde Ukrainian girls who waitress in the new , toney restaurants that dot Main Street . But the older folks in town insist that the top beauties are homegrown , the result of the blend of old Berkshire people and the immigrants , by which they mean the cross-pollination of the original , moneyed , cream-skinned , Anglo-Saxon families with succeeding waves of strong-featured Polish , Irish , and Italian mill workers . Yet this genetic concoction hardly distinguishes Grandville from most towns in the Northeast , plus , in most cases , it is out of date by at least two generations-the local mixes have mixed and mixed again with all manner of stock . <p> The theory both Franny and her dad jokingly subscribe to is that it is something in the water-all this Grandville pulchritude is generated by a rare , unidentified mineral that percolates into Great Pond Reservoir . " If either of us had a head for business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those New York harpies that come up here , " Wendell deVries likes to say . <p> But even in this context , Franny deVries looks good- damned good , and not just for her age . She is long-limbed , smooth-skinned , and shapely , with wide-set , Delft-blue eyes from the deVries side , and pronounced , high-angled cheekbones from the Cosgrove line . Her face has always been lively and expressive , and became even more so after her three years studying drama at Ithaca College . Those years also contribute to Franny 's theatrical flair for dress . Often she selects the day 's outfit , hairdo , and make-up with an eye on a role , an aspect of her personality that she wants to bring to the fore for the day , usually just for her own amusement , though sometimes she has a few half-rehearsed lines in mind to go with her costume . <p> On this cool , September morning , Franny is standing at the window of Write Now in a pair of snug-fitting , Calvin Klein jeans and a tie-dyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The prongs of the inverted ' Y ' of the symbol seem to point straight to the tips of her breasts and Franny is well aware of that . It is just such touches that sell unorthodox ideas . Today , Franny is selling an end to the war in Iraq . <p> She smiles as two early-morning regulars approach the shop door : Archie Morris , the soon-to-retire fire chief , and Michael Dowd , one of the half-dozen second-homers who moved up to Grandville to live full time after 9/11 . <p> " You 're too sexy for your shirt , " Morris says to her , holding the door open for Dowd . Although Morris is the same age as Franny 's father-they graduated together in Grandville High 's class of ' 56-he likes to keep up with what he believes is current lingo , and no one , least of all Franny , would think of telling him that his ' too sexy for your shirt ' line is a good ten years out of date . <p> " Looks good to me , " Dowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York transplants , Dowd arrived here with a preconceived portrait of small town life and his role in it . Certainly some of this picture comes from his summer vacations and winter ski weekends in Grandville , but much of it is an amalgam of books he has read ( Spoon River Anthology was a favorite of his in prep school ) and films he has seen ( he owns the DVD of It 's A Wonderful Life ) , plus a kaleidoscope of images torn from L.L.Bean catalogues . Spoon River accounts for the sepia-toned naivetT with which he imbues even the most wily Grandville natives , Bean for the red , clip-on suspenders that hold up his corduroy trousers this morning . <p> " Car bomb in Baghdad , " Franny says , handing Dowd his reserved New York Times and Wall Street Journal . " Seven dead . " <p> " How 's the coffee today ? " Morris asks . <p> " About the same as yesterday 's , only a day older , " Franny replies , sliding behind the counter to pour him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Michael Dowd asks . <p> " None . " <p> " Thank God for that , " Morris says . <p> " Unless you happen to be Iraqi , " Franny says , handing the fire chief his coffee . <p> Morris grins . " Too early in the day for politics , Franny , " he says . <p> " It 's the middle of the afternoon in Baghdad , " Dowd says . Although Michael Dowd is in his mid-forties , he has never completely shed his earnest , **25;348;TOOLONG manner . <p> " Did n't say it was too early in the day for them to talk politics , " Morris retorts . <p> Franny can not help but appreciate Archie Morris 's effortless one-upmanship , the wisest wise guy in the class . Still , she wishes he would consider this awfulness in Iraq more seriously . " I just hate to see innocent people die for no good reason , " she says . <p> Morris sips his coffee , says nothing for a moment , then , " Wendell going to get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Franny says . " I hear it stinks . " <p> " Not if it 's got close-ups of her lips , " Dowd pipes up . " Pillows . They look like silk pillows . " Dowd is clearly trying to regain some traction in the conversation with some man talk , and indeed , Archie Morris favors him with a knowing smirk . So much for the mayhem in Baghdad . <p> Dowd selects a Triple Threat Caramel Peanut Fusion PowerBar , pays up , and heads back for the door . " Babs is really looking forward to tonight , " he calls to Franny before he leaves . <p> Michael Dowd will now make his way to the third floor of the Melville Block , then down the corridor to his three-room office containing eight computers , two fax machines , and a specially-wired phone system with five separate numbers , including two with a Manhattan prefix that relays to Grandville via ' call forwarding . ' Here , with the assistance of two locally born young women , he manages the mutual fund he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than twenty percent of his former office there . For this reason alone , Dowd blesses the day that he and Babs decided to leave Manhattan 's Upper East Side for Grandville . <p> Archie Morris leaves the shop moments after him , taking a second cup of Franny 's coffee with him . He will stroll past the Phoenix to the firehouse on its other side , the consequence of some curious , 1910 town planning that has pitted sirens and bells against singers and soundtracks for close to a century . There , as the only paid member of Grandville 's volunteer fire department , he will sit beside the phone watching soap operas and talk shows on teevee for the next nine hours . <p> Only minutes later , a second pair enters Write Now : Franny 's father and his dog , Binx , a mongrel terrier who has been Wendell 's faithful sidekick for nine years . Wendell deVries is a big man , both in height and around the middle . His face is large and ruddy , capped with a full head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetually plays on his lips give him the appearance of an overgrown boy-say , a scruffy farm kid who is well known to the truant officer . <p> Last night , Wendell did not return to the half of the two-family house on Mahaiwe Street that he shares with Franny and her daughter , his granddaughter , Lila . This is not an unusual occurrence . Two or three times a week , after the evening 's last screening and after he has perfunctorily cleaned up the theatre , shut off the popcorn machine , and locked the Phoenix 's doors , Wendell stops at the Railroad Car , the last of the original taverns on Railroad Street and the bar of choice for native-born Grandvillians . There , he downs two or three double Scotches before stumbling back to the Phoenix to sleep in a brass bed in the largest of the old dressing rooms . On some of those nights , Wendell 's lady friend , Maggie Bello , may join him . On those occasions , Binx sleeps fitfully in the theater wings , stage right . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last night was not one of those occasions-Binx looks rested and Wendell has clearly slept in his clothes . <p> " Hey , Monkey , " Wendell says as he comes in . " You 're the prettiest thing in the world . " <p> " Runs in the family , " Franny replies . <p> Wendell kisses her in the middle of her forehead , then scoots behind her to pour himself a cup of coffee . <p> " There was another car bomb in Baghdad , " Franny says , pointing at the headline in the Boston Globe . <p> " This country is run by a bunch of assholes . " <p> " I 'm glad somebody notices , " Franny says . She hands Binx half a bagel-with-peanut-butter sandwich left over from yesterday 's lunch . <p> " Oh , people are starting to notice , " her father says . " It just takes time to sink in . " <p> " And how time flies while bodies are being dismembered . " <p> Wendell offers his daughter a smile touched with both pride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her mother 's exacerbated by her Ithaca theater training . But he also admires that pungent mouth on her ; she is what his father used to call , " a firecracker . " <p> Franny scribbles a few grocery items on a note pad , then rips off the page and hands it to her father . <p> " Jesus , tofu again ? " Wendell says . <p> " She 's got to get some protein in her , " Franny replies . Last spring , when she turned sixteen , Lila declared that she was becoming a vegetarian , and although Franny approves in principle , she is worried sick that it is the first sign of anorexia , a condition that is currently sweeping Grandville High School . <p> " That stuff puts my bowels in an uproar , " Wendell says . <p> " So get yourself a steak . " <p> Wendell shrugs and stuffs the list into his back pocket . Both of them know that he will not buy himself a steak , and not because of the annoying complication of cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself any red meat because of the sickened expression in Lila 's eyes it would elicit . It does not really matter to him anyhow . He looks forward to his once-a-week dinners alone with Lila , even if lately she does not have much to say to him . Wendell is more than content simply to look across the kitchen table at his granddaughter . That act alone suffuses him with gratefulness . <p> After he leaves , Franny-honoring the new town ordinance-steps outside her shop for the first of her self-allotted , six cigarettes of the day . A few leaves have turned yellow on the tops of the poplars that line Melville Street . That , and the sudden absence of vacationers , put her in an inward mood . Franny is devoted to the change of seasons and to the changes of temperament that accompany each of them . She believes that people who live in single season climes , like the tropics , must lack a living sense of history . True enough , but then September is here again so quickly that it feels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the distinctly autumnal cast of her thought . <p> Chapter Two For the twenty-six years since Sally deVries passed away and Emile retired , subsequently selling the family home and moving to Arizona , Wendell deVries has been the projectionist and sole manager of the Phoenix Theater . But the tasks and routines that thrilled him as a boy and young man no longer do so . One reason is that in 1987 , the heirs of Jay Cosgrove , Isaiah Smith , and William Watts , along with Emile himself , sold the theater to a chain headquartered in London . In itself , that would not have troubled Wendell-unlike his forebears , he never had an appetite for ownership . But along with the deed , the London group also took remote control of the basic operation of the theater : what films it would run , when , and for how long . <p> Yet Wendell still cherishes the place . He has a dog-like dedication to familiarity . The walls of the projection booth are his personal museum : a framed , hand-colored photograph of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Court Jester , and Flame Over India ; the instruction manual for his first projector , the Brenkert BX-80 ; several Vitagraph cards ; a good twenty out-of-date calendars ; half a dozen pictures of Franny growing up , plus a half-dozen more of Lila . Layers . If at times , idly peering out of the booth 's six-inch window , Wendell glimpses a patch of paint hanging from the Phoenix 's vaulted ceiling or a tear in the back of a velour-covered seat , he sees it as natural history-maturation , not deterioration . <p> Without informing the Phoenix 's overseas owners , Wendell does not show films on Tuesday nights-which , in any event , are slow nights at best . He simply subtracts a few ticket sales from Saturday and plugs them in on Tuesday on his weekly receipt report . On Tuesdays , the Grandville Players take possession of the theater while Wendell feeds and , if she is in the mood , talks with his granddaughter . Later , Wendell is likely to pull a book from the shelf in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> * * * <p> After buttoning a denim work shirt over her T-shirt , Franny sets up ten folding chairs in a circle on the stage . The few footlights still operable are on , as are the cyclorama floods illuminating the stage 's brick rear wall . The lighting secludes the stage from the rest of the theater transforming it into an intimate space , although obviously anyone lurking about in the dark could plainly see what is happening onstage . Live drama depends on this pretense-intensely private moments shamelessly exposed to public view-and Franny often wonders if this fundamental deception is theater 's main allure for her . God knows , she is packed with hidden thoughts and feelings she yearns to expose . <p> Franny is sitting in the chair nearest the back wall munching on a Milky Way when the newest member of the Grandville Players arrives , Babs Dowd . She is an angular woman with straight , shoulder-length , auburn hair who wears wool sweaters and tweed skirts undoubtedly bought at the same Lenox dress shop Franny 's mother fancies . As Babs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very day she and Michael moved up permanently to Grandville . She says that she always dreamed of being a part of what she calls " a small regional theater " because it has so many more possibilities than the money-driven theaters of Manhattan . Franny is fairly sure that this is just another way for Babs to say that the theaters of Manhattan never expressed any interest in her , but Franny is not bothered by that . She likes Babs 's verve . Most of the other members of the troupe are long past verve . <p> " How 's Lila ? " Babs asks , striding down the center aisle with a calfskin attachT case swinging at her side . Babs memorized the names of every family member of the Grandville Players on her first day . <p> " Good . Last time I saw her , " Franny replies . She knows that Babs has two children of her own , young teens boarding at the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut , but she can never remember their names so she is unable to reciprocate the pleasantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babs says , seating herself directly across from Franny . <p> " Right on time . The others are late . " <p> " But it does give me a chance to ask you something , " Babs goes on . " A favor , actually . " <p> " Shoot . " <p> " Well , I know we 're kind of casting about for our next production . " <p> " That we are , " Franny says . In truth , Franny has a play very much in mind for the next production-Arthur Miller 's The Crucible . Although it requires a large cast , Franny is sure they could pull it off . She is drawn to the play by its pertinence to the current political climate , now even more relevant than to the McCarthyism that was gripping the country when the play was originally produced . But choosing productions is a democratic process , even if in the past Franny 's choices have always prevailed . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
