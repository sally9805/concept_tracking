At 3:30 on a Sunday Morning , Brandon Straub soberly surveyed the bodies draped across the sofas in his fraternity house at Indiana University . Two girls cuddled and exchanged a languid kiss . One 's breast popped out of her low-cut top . " Aaaawesome , " drawled one of Straub 's frat brothers . Straub could only muster an awkward half-smile . " I 'd be lying if I did n't say that seeing some of these scenes makes me sad , " he said . " How will they feel when they wake up in the morning ? " <P> Truth is , most of them would n't be up in the morning . By the time the revelers rose , after noon , Straub , 21 , who is not only a loyal fraternity member but also a leader in the Greek InterVarsity Christian Fellowship , had already gone to church and come back . As some of his frat brothers nursed hangovers and others cleaned up from the night before , Straub pondered his situation . He walks a fine line of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review as America 's No. 15 party school ( and No. 5 in the category " lots of beer " ) . The challenge , Straub says , is " How can I serve God and love the guys here ? " <P> College is traditionally a time of transition and new freedoms , the years when young people have to figure out for the first time who they are . The task is even more complex for the growing number of devout young Christians on secular college campuses who feel called to approach this time in a way that sets them apart . They draw inspiration from Paul 's letter to the Romans : " Do not be conformed to this world . " But the Bible gives few details on how to navigate the collegiate world in 2005 , leaving Christians to grapple with tough questions as they try to integrate their beliefs  --  and themselves  --  into college life : Can they be , like Straub , both a brother in Christ and a brother in a frat ? Or should they live only with other believers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may hold ? And what does it mean to live out their faith on a secular campus like Indiana 's ? <P> Faith matters to students as they head off to college , but then it tends to lapse . In a national study issued last month by UCLA 's Higher Education Research Institute , 79% of 112,000 freshmen surveyed profess a belief in God ; 69% say they pray . Still , only 40% think it is very important to follow religious teachings in everyday life . Spiritually , " college is a time of flux , " says Alexander Astin , the study 's co  --  principal investigator . That leads to " a dramatic falling-off of religious participation during the undergraduate years . " But a significant minority are holding fast to their faith . Fourteen percent put themselves in the " other Christian " category  --  dominated by the nondenominational Protestant churches that have proliferated across the U.S.  --  up from just 5% in 1989 . And 26% of the students surveyed call themselves born-again Christians , which would be a natural constituency for religious-fellowship groups on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer than 5% of the 30,000 undergraduates participate in one of the campus 's Christian groups . But that 's an uptick since the stridently secular 1960s , says dean of students Richard McKaig . In the past five years , " attention to spirituality has been especially strong . " But committed Christians seem to want more than just spiritual living . " They 're looking for something deeper , " he says .
