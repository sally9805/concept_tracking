<p> The revelation came to John Swofford over the morning corn flakes , when the ACC commissioner would review the new college basketball rankings with his breakfast . <p> After a few weeks , he was no longer sure what he was reading . <p> " Sometime over the course of the year , you 'd look at the standings and wonder how applicable they are , " Swofford said . " There were so many good teams and the season was too unpredictable . " <p> This from a man who digests rankings for a living . But there is the mantra as America takes pencil to NCAA bracket this week . That 's not vertigo . That is equality . Evidence says this , the tournament that ends April 2 at the Georgia Dome , will be the most competitive , least calculable ever . And if that leaves the office pool in a lather , imagine the coaches . <p> Asked beforehand what seeding preference he thought his team deserved , Tony Bennett , coach of the surprising Washington State Cougars said , " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a 3 or a 4 or whatever , I do n't know how significant that is . I 'm not really sure anymore . " <p> Neither was The Associated Press poll . Forty-nine teams wound up ranked at some point in the AP Top 25 , a record total ( and the most since 48 schools made the list in 1954-55 ) . <p> In sum , five different schools were ranked No. 1 ( Florida , UCLA , Ohio State , Wisconsin and North Carolina ) . And while five is not a record , only once in the past 11 years has that number been higher ( six in 2003-04 ) . Last season , there were only two teams ranked No. 1 all year . The season before that , three . <p> There have been historic rises : Butler crashing the top 10 ; Winthrop making its top 25 debut . There have been dramatic tailspins : Clemson starting 17-0 and then going 4-10 ; Connecticut , an Elite Eight entrant a year ago , finishing 12th in the Big East the next . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force rose in its place . The NCAA selection committee did n't just have trouble filling out the field . As committee chairman Gary Walters said last week , " I would also say there appears to be less clarity this year among the top of the field . " <p> Selections get tougher <p> Did n't quite agree with the committee 's handiwork on Selection Sunday ? That train was loading last week . But it is undeniable Walters found " less clarity " because that is today 's Division I landscape . And there will be less and less clarity in the years to come . <p> " You 've got three or five or six elite teams , but the next hundred , you can throw them all in a sack and then draw them out one by one and you 'd be OK , " said Bill Frieder , coach turned analyst . " Once you get to this point in the season , they 're all the same . " <p> Perhaps it was the rise of the Gonzaga Zags that demonstrated to contemporary university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those conferences that start with " Big . " Between the proliferation of conference television contracts and ticket revenues to be had from a hot program , the mid-majors have become an undeniable force , and the big schools do n't know how to take it . <p> For all the criticism the NCAA took for including four members of the Missouri Valley Conference in last year 's field ( same number as the ACC ) , the advancement of Wichita State and Bradley to the Sweet 16 verified they belonged . George Mason 's march to the Final Four gave the traditionalists the final kick in the pants . The portal to March has been forced open . <p> " I think the administrations at the MVC schools have said , ' Hey , we 're going to have to work at this if we 're going to compete , ' " said Drake coach Tom Davis , whose long career has been spent in the Big Ten , Pac-10 , ACC and Big East . " In some leagues , you 'll see schools do n't take it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their thinking . <p> " You do n't see that in the Valley . " <p> Talent more widely spread <p> But it has taken more than institutional will . At the foundation , it has taken rule changes . The scholarship limit , for instance , cutting back from 15 to 13 in 1993 , sent an overflow of perhaps 200 freshmen to " second-tier " programs , which have thrived . <p> In states like Wisconsin and Texas , where summer basketball programs were once non-existent , a new emphasis on the high school game has brought on a wave of improved talent . Plus , with three or four games televised every weeknight , the recruit has found he does n't have to go to North Carolina to get noticed . <p> " Hey , there are guys who do n't like L.A , " said Mike Gminski , the 1979 ACC player of the year at Duke . " There are guys who like smaller towns . Because there are so many games on TV now , that really helps those small-town schools . " <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season 's new rule regulating that U.S. high school players must wait a year after graduating before entering the draft . Programs signing the elite stars may see immediate benefits at the sacrifice of continuity . March teaches every year that a team stocked with fourth-year players has a certain something that a passel of McDonald 's All-American underclassmen does not . <p> " This has been an evolution of a dozen years or so , " CBS analyst Billy Packer said . " You 're seeing so many people with an opportunity to win because you no longer have the dominant junior or senior at those prime programs . You might see someone like North Carolina 's Brandan Wright or someone like Ohio State 's Greg Oden or a guy like Texas ' Kevin Durant . <p> " But they 're freshmen . Those guys used to be seniors . " <p> The Pac-10 , which just completed its most competitive season ever , lists 43 underclassmen among its starters . San Diego State , which did not make the NCAA field , quietly upset ranked opponents BYU , Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a pat on the back . <p> Should the Drexel Dragons get a crack at the Big East ? The Winthrop Eagles against the SEC ? And where is Creighton again ? <p> " I 'll tell you one thing , " Packer said . " It 's made it a lot of fun to watch . "
