An Ancient Ideal <p> Internet teaching offers a new medium to the delivery of education . While it has caused much anxiety in the teaching community , recent class comparisons show it to be superior in many facets . One of those facets is based on the ancient teaching idea of rhetoric in learning known as progymnastia . The internet medium facilitates the use of this old learning technique with much success and increased student participation . With strong teacher planning and coordination , the internet can become a real teaching tool for the future . <p> The ancient world , like today , struggled with its approach to education . There was a tension between the grammarians and the schools of rhetoric . The ancient Greek system started with the early ages in grammar school focusing on writing and the written words . The rhetorician schools of Socrates and Plato were reserved for older students . With the exception of Aristodemus of Nyso , the Greeks never taught grammar and rhetoric together at one school . The Romans , while favoring the grammarian approach , also allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristodemus blended approach as the ideal . <p> The approach of these educational blends still favored the Greek rhetoric approach . The educational blend of the two was known as progymnastic exercises or progymnastia . St. Augustine in the fourth century described the use of progymnastic exercises in colorful detail as his favorite . Progymnastic exercises were a powerful technique and approach . They combined language , composition , and the questioning approaches of the best of each of the ancient approaches . Progymnastic approaches ultimately gave way to the lecture and composition approach of today . This was a result of the need for larger class sizes and a need to cover more material . The power of progymnastia and rhetoric was lost for lack of a powerful medium . A new Medium - the Internet <p> Internet teaching offers a new challenge and a new medium for teachers . When I personally started Internet teaching at a college level , I was suspect of the new medium . It appeared to be an inferior medium to face-to-face lecture and discussion . In fact , lecture via the Internet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture in the chat room symrochures mode . The asynchronous mode brings other challenges of effective independent study . The real surprise was in the synchronous chat rooms that the use of questions dramatically increases class participation over the normal classroom setting . In fact , it allows many to achieve the Greek ideal of progymnastia and rhetoric . <p> Generally , the use of lecture via Internet courses is too abstract for learning . It puts a true distance in distance learning . Lecture in the classroom lacks verbal interaction at times , but there remains strong non-verbal interaction . Lecture in synchronous Internet courses reduces the courses to self-study . The use of questions and rhetoric can bring interaction and a new level of learning . Of course , as with the Greek 's progymnastia approach , some reading is required as well as traditional ancillary components such as assignments and tests . Still the central learning focus of the progymnastic approach is planned questioning to achieve understanding . Rhetoric is central to the progymnastic approach and the Internet medium . Internet Challenges to Teaching <p> Many educators have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . The real issue , however , is that the Internet requires a different approach . The Internet challenges include a methodology to promote interaction , replacing the personal touch of the classroom , student motivation , and learning performance . Some of the early approaches to Internet learning were , at best , a new delivery system for self-study or an awkward adaptation of traditional lecture . In the asynchronous mode , it remains difficult to overcome the mentioned challenges . Synchronous with chat rooms on the other hand has the potential to not only meet the challenges but also offers a superior educational tool . <p> The issue is to develop the techniques needed for the new medium versus trying to fit traditional classroom methodology . As noted , adapted lecture techniques lack the interaction of the classroom . What is needed is a method to involve the student in the chat . It is here that the new medium offers an opportunity to use the mode of questioning used in early Greek rhetoric and progymnastic approaches . <p> University of Findlay has been a pioneer in Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet or combination of classroom/Internet . With the some courses offered by both methods , many comparisons have been studied . What stands out is the use of questions during traditional classroom lecture often results in a limited response . The same course , same questions in an Internet class results in an explosion of responses ! Progymnastia <p> The use of questions to build a learning result is not common in today 's lecture-oriented classrooms . The search for the use of rhetoric in education naturally leads to ancient Greek techniques . In particular , a methodology of questioning was needed to assure learning outcomes . There was also a need to fully integrate reading assignments , written assignments , and rhetoric . This requirement of integration led to the combination techniques of progymnastia used in the third and fourth century . <p> Progymnastia might be considered an evolutionary link between ancient Greek schools and the medieval lecture system of today . It is rooted in the questioning techniques of rhetoric but adds written assignments and reading into a coordinated approach . Questions remained the backbone of the approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinated , and integrated to allow the student to achieve learning goals . A Coordinated Approach <p> It is amazing that the various third century progymnastia schools debated whether the student should read prior to the rhetoric session . The ancient Greeks never fully resolved which was best ( reading after or prior ) to maximize learning . That 's good news in a way because each Internet class has a mix of students as to prior preparation . Our application of progymnastia does not require the assumption of prior reading or preparation . In fact , the question structure is based on no preparation , which is the likely norm today . Finally , progymnastia brings in reading and assignments to augment the total learning . The Structure of Questioning <p> With progymnastia , questions move from the general to specific . The role of the teacher is to prepare and coordinate this questioning to facilitate the group 's evolution of key concepts . The Internet , in particular , allows the direction and pace to be " controlled " by the teacher . The pace is very natural , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 1 is a very simple progymnastic plan for a quality management session . Note the lead question is how the session starts and sets the direction . As with traditional approaches , the teacher must integrate the text into the plan . Ultimately , the teacher must maintain direction with further questioning . <p> The key to success in the use of progymnastia is preparation and obtained rhetoric skills of the teacher . The benefits are huge in that the student is an integral part of the learning process . One very noticeable result is student participation in the process is greatly increased . The chat room environment seems to break down traditional barriers to participation . Discussions with students note the lack of fear of public speaking , the ability to " prepare " an answer , and lack of embarrassment in case of wrong answers . Another finding is that students who rarely speak up in traditional settings become quite " verbose " in an Internet environment . Potential Problems <p> The success of this simple teaching technique is restricted by several parameters . The natural high interactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , I can offer no scientific data as of yet , but the University of Findlay does have extensive experience in the last five years . Class sizes over fifteen students can start to restrict the teacher 's ability to coordinate and direct the flow questioning . One successful technique of larger classes is to segment the class into halves or thirds to respond to each question . <p> The use of progymnastic techniques works best for courses that are focused on concepts versus detail . Courses like accounting , mathematics , and physical sciences can present some difficulties for the progymnastic approach . Some Additional Requirements <p> The use of rhetoric and questioning as the main learning mode is foreign to most of us . The technique is best coordinated with auxiliary methods that fit . For example , essay tests are a better fit than detail tests such as multiple choice . It is also important to work closely with the text since this can increase the student 's ability to contribute to the discussion . Text cases can become a critical part of the course learning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation by the teacher is required to assure terminology and definitions are learned via discussion . <p> The assignment load was initially increased over traditional to assure quality . However , with time , this has been proven unnecessary . The nature of the assignments is different than traditional settings because the assignments are used to learn needed detail lacking in the conceptual chats . Many times this is the reserve of traditional where case studies and essay questions are used to develop concepts . Conclusion <p> It is common at the University of Findlay to teach the same course in the traditional classroom mode and the Internet mode . The University has been one of the first to develop an MBA degree fully available via internet while offering the same courses in the traditional classroom setting as well . Applying the same tests over the years has shown the Internet progymnastic approach to actually produce superior learning . Student feedback also supports the finding . <p> DIAGRAM : A PROGYMNASTIC LESSON PLAN <p> By Dr. Quentin R.
