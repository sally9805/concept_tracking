The choir was cutting up . Reverend Simon Jackson enthusiastically clapped as they sang " Stomp " by Kirk Franklin . Loretta Jackson beamed as she watched her husband swing jubilantly to the music . She knew Simon was n't too keen on these newfound gospel hip-hoppers , as he called them , but the choir had the church on its feet . Even he had to admit they sounded good . The choir began winding down and Simon stood and approached the podium . He was radiating with pride as he looked out at his members . And as she did every Sunday just before his sermon , Loretta gave him a reassuring smile . It made her happy to see her husband doing what he loved best , being pastor of Zion Hill , one of the best churches in Houston , as he always proclaimed . " Let the church say amen ! " Simon yelled . " Amen ! " the congregation replied in unison . " Let 's give our outstanding choir another round of applause because they sure spread God 's message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members settled in their seats . Loretta was sitting in her usual front row seat . Good music always rejuvenated Simon , so she knew they were in for a rousing sermon . Loretta opened her Bible as she glanced around . She sighed deeply becauseRachel had n't yet made it to church and she knew Simon would take notice . " Now , if you will , turn your Bibles to Proverbs twenty-eight , thirteen . I know everyone has their Bible , right ? " Simon sang . Several people chuckled . " Of course we do , Pastor , " an elderly woman named Ida Hicks shouted . Simon nodded at Sister Hicks , who was sitting in the front pew as well . Sister Hicks was decked out from head to toe in white , from her huge hat that looked like wings coming off the side of her head to her white stockings and scuffed-up white pumps . Loretta tried to stifle a smile , because Simon often complained about Sister Hicks , saying she was like the student in class who always had the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone at the church crazy , but she was the original pastor 's widow , so people still gave her respect . " Well , wonderful . Has everyone found the verse ? " Simon said as his gaze made its way to the back of the church . Loretta gently turned to see what he was looking at . She shook her head . Their nineteen-year-old daughter , Rachel , was trying to sneak in late  --  again . That meant there would be a big argument right before Sunday dinner . Simon was just about fed up with Rachel . She 'd stay out partying all Saturday night , and then could n't drag herself out of bed to make it to church on Sunday morning . Simon always complained that if it were n't for Loretta keeping Rachel 's two kids every weekend , his grandchildren probably would n't make it to church either . Loretta tried not to let Rachel 's entrance sour her mood , but she could n't help but exhale in frustration . Not only was Rachel late , but she had the audacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to blow a gasket . Not that it would do any good . Even though Rachel was raised in the church , getting her there before the benediction was almost impossible . Loretta snapped back to the sermon , which Simon had begun as he tried to mask the scowl on his face . " All right , I want to talk about how what 's done in the dark will come to light . " " I know that 's right ! You preach , Pastor ! " Sister Hicks exclaimed . Simon looked at Sister Hicks and forced a smile . Loretta knew exactly what her husband was thinking . He wanted Sister Hicks to shut up and let him preach . They went through this same routine every Sunday . Loretta had thought Simon would have been used to it by now , but he still complained about it after every service . " As I was saying , many of us do things we think nobody else knows about . But God knows ! " Simon bellowed . Loretta hoped Rachel was listening , because Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds . Simon near ' bout had a heart attack when Rachel turned up pregnant at fifteen . Then she went out and had another child three years later . Simon would barely speak to her the entire time she was pregnant . Not only was he thoroughly embarrassed , but he was extremely disappointed in their daughter . But more than anything , Loretta knew Simon was hurt by his daughter 's actions , feeling that he had failed her . Although that 's something he 'd never , ever admit . Loretta tried to get thoughts of her family drama out of her mind and focus all her attention on her husband . He was getting worked up now ; beads of sweat were trickling across his brow . She admired his strong physique . For 55 years old , he was stunningly handsome with a commanding presence , like he belonged in that pulpit , born to lead people down the path of righteousness . Simon continued with his sermon , urging his congregation to lead meaningful and fulfilling Christian lives . For twenty-five minutes he continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the urge came over him and delivering a rousing sermon . Loretta could always tell how well he preached by the number of people who got the spirit during his sermon . Usually , it was only ten or fifteen people , not counting Sister Hicks , who always got the Holy Ghost every Sunday . ( In private Simon had once said that he thought it was all an act , but Loretta had told him , who was he to judge . ) As the organist began playing , Simon extended his arms as if opening the doors of the church , and invited people to join him near the pulpit . He smiled down at Loretta again . She gave him the standard " you did good " nod , as she began swaying to the sounds of the music . Loretta could feel the powerful love of her husband as he glanced around the room , his gaze always coming back to her . Simon always called her the saving grace in his family because she helped him keep it all together when it seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the problems with their oldest son , David , and the drama surrounding Rachel , it seemed Loretta was having to do a lot more saving these days . But she did n't complain . She loved her husband and her kids and would do anything for them . So far , no one had made their way to the front of the church . " The doors of the church are still open . Do n't be afraid . Come now . Let the Lord be your guide , " Simon said . Sometimes it took a while for anyone to come up , so Simon would usually keep his arms outstretched as the music continued to play . Loretta stole another look at Rachel . I know she is not asleep ! But that was n't true . She quickly turned her attention back to Simon , hoping he would n't notice . Of course as luck would have it , he noticed it about the same time he was wrapping things up . Simon took a deep breath , trying not to let his disgust show to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as day . Although she would never give up on any of her kids , Loretta knew Simon was about ready to write Rachel off , just as he 'd done David . Loretta sighed . If only they could hold on two more weeks . That 's when Jonathan , the one child who had made Simon proud , would return home . Simon was already so excited , it 's all he 'd talked about the last month . Simon was always a little more tolerant of Rachel and David whenever Jonathan was around . Loretta hated how Simon differentiated between the kids . But she knew his relationship with Rachel and David was something he 'd have to work through in his own due time . But that did n't mean she 'd stop trying to pull her family back together . Heck , she could n't stop trying even if she wanted to . She believed with all her heart that she 'd been blessed with a wonderful family , despite their shortcomings and she 'd do whatever it took to hold them together .
