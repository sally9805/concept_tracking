WHEN HE WOKE , HE TURNED on his torch and saw the vine crawling down the cave tunnel toward him . It moved so slowly - the cave was almost too cold for it - but red buds still formed in the light . He burned it , then ran up the tunnel torching the thin , trembling vine , choking in the smoke till he tripped and fell . <p> The vine shivered , turned its black stub toward him , and crawled for his head . <p> He vomited . Pollen-induced nausea , he told himself . Nothing more . <p> But nothing stopped it . It was a good hunter . He knew just how good . He watched it inch toward him till it was only two feet away , then he stood and backed down the tunnel . It crawled on - warily , he thought  --  and hesitated on the edge of the vomit . It turned the stub away . One leaf farther back reached out to touch it , testing making sure - at once a hollow tube behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Red buds formed behind each third leaf . <p> He staggered away , down the tunnel and into the last gallery , to pools at the back where the cave ended . He turned off the torch - his only light - to conserve energy , then sat in the sudden darkness . <p> It had trapped him . It had choked the cave 's entrance shut . He had nowhere left to run . He could not burn his way out - the pollen would stop him first . The vomit would stop it for a short time , but it would come . Buds would open . Pollen would drift down to him and make him sleep . <p> He ripped off a shirt-sleeve , plunged it in a pool of water , wrapped it tight around his nose and mouth . If I can keep the sleeve wet , he thought , and still breathe <p> He heard it : a distant sound like that of a cork pulled from a bottle of wine . Abud opened . Another . Two more . He splashed water over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants pocket , turned it on . <p> " Lieutenant ? " the comm said . The computer on the other end had the soft voice of a woman . <p> " Has the Scimitar sent rescue ? " <p> " No . The landing bay is not yet repaired . " <p> It was why he and the two members of his team had stayed on the world conducting more and more studies - a T-34 had exploded in the docking bay . No ship-to-land craft had been able to dock or take off since then . They 'd been stranded without possibility of refueling for the return trip - no refuel drones could descend to give them what they needed to return or even just to fly one hundred miles away , even just that . <p> " Are you still broadcasting distress signals ? " he asked the computer . <p> " On all standard and seventeen nonstandard frequencies . " <p> " And my coordinates ? " <p> " Your present location is - " <p> " Are you broadcasting them ? " <p> " At intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . " <p> " But there is no time , " he whispered . <p> Brant had died first . Sarah had found him still alive but lying in mud staring up at nothing while the vine bored through his suit into his chest . He and Sarah had buried Brant away from the ship , in a grave as deep as they could dig . <p> Sarah had gone next . She had lain comatose in the lander for two days after breaking a vial of concentrated pollen she 'd prepared for study . Everything he 'd done to try to save her had failed . Outside , the vine had quietly surrounded the lander . <p> She 'd briefly regained consciousness , once . She 'd felt convinced that bacteria from Brant 's body would kill the vine . " Just like Wells 's Martians , " she 'd whispered , almost sadly . <p> But it had n't . He 'd buried her next to Brant . <p> And he 'd stayed with the lander as long as he could , in contact with the Scimitar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to keep the vine burned from the lander , but more and more of it had come and he could not keep it back . When it began to break through the hatch , he 'd packed food and supplies , jettisoned the rest of the food , and emptied the sewers so the vine would n't tear the lander apart and destroy the computer . He 'd dressed in a bio-suit that would protect him from the pollen and burned his way out of the lander into the jungle past the vine . <p> TO THE EAST were mountains , far off , white capped . His plan was to reach the mountains , climb above the vine 's biozone , and wait there for rescue . They had landed in a river delta rich with life . What he wanted now was to be someplace high and cold where he was the only living thing . <p> By nightfall , he was in a place where the forest canopy was so thick he could not see the mountains . He stashed his gear at the base of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed away - something else alive here , he marveled . He and Sarah and Brant had cataloged far fewer species in this lush forest than they had expected . He now knew why . He wondered how anything survived . Speed and cunning , he thought . Speed and determination . He was glad to have seen the animal . It gave him hope . He climbed into the canopy : and the mountains were still far off . They seemed no closer . <p> Something tugged at his foot . He looked down and saw a tendril of vine circled around his boot . He kicked , but the vine 's grip tightened . He tried to pull it off , but more and more of the vine kept circling his boot , pulling him deeper into the darkening canopy . <p> Something touched his hand , and it was the vine . Another tendril dangled down toward his head , the flowers on it lovely and red . <p> He pulled out his knife and cut his hand free . He cut his foot free and climbed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine had found his food . His pack was covered in a mass of seething , flowered vine . He cut it back , threw it in heaps and burned it . He burned back the tendrils reaching down for him from above . <p> His pack had been tom apart . The food was scattered . He salvaged the water-filtration unit , the med kit , his sleeping gear . He took the packages of food that had n't been opened . <p> And he ran for the mountains . <p> THE VINE WAITED on the trail . It was a clever hunter . If you were panicked - if you ran in terror  --  you 'd never see its tendrils stretched across the trail at ankle-height . <p> He tripped and fell , his gear scattered around him , and a mass of vine fell on him . It circled his body and choked him and tried to stab through his biosuit with its rigid tubes . <p> He tried to stay calm . He cut the vine again and again , and he kept cutting till he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts he had cut it into . It had been slow and sluggish - but still deadly - by day . He learned it was a nocturnal hunter . <p> " Lieutenant ? " the voice out of the comm unit said . " Lieutenant ? " <p> He did n't want to answer it . He had n't slept for two days . The vine had <p> followed him . It , and others like it . Vines seemed to be everywhere : in the clearings , in the trees , in the undergrowth stretched across the trails . <p> " There were these two guys sitting at a bar - " <p> " Stop the jokes , " he said . <p> " The ship ordered me to keep your spirits up . Jokes are calculated to do that . I have heard different flight crews tell four hundred ninety-seven complete jokes and thirty-three partial jokes interrupted by necessary work . I remember them all and can divide them into subcategories . What type of joke do you like best ? " <p> " Sleepy jokes , stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Two hundred and thirty-nine of my recorded jokes mention items related to sleep - beds for instance . Do you want to hear them ? " <p> He turned off the comm unit . <p> When he turned it back on , it was silent . He let it stay that way . He needed the computer , but he liked it quiet . After a time , it spoke . <p> " Do n't do that again , , " it said . <p> " So now you 're giving me orders ? " <p> " I was worried . " <p> That made him stop . If he could have opened the visor on the biosuit to wipe his face , he would have . If he could have looked at the computer , he would have . He looked around for the vine , but could n't see it . <p> " How close are the mountains ? " the computer asked . <p> " What do you mean by ' worried ' ? " <p> " How close are the mountains , Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are my charge . I have orders to help you . " <p> " You helped me before you received your present orders . " <p> " It is what I am made for . " <p> They were both quiet fora time . " Are you all right ? " he asked it , then . <p> " The vine is not attacking the ship anymore , but the ship is highly damaged . It will never fly again . I am intact inside it . " <p> " They 'll take you out and carry you back to the Scimitar . " <p> " If they have time . " <p> " You cost too much to abandon . " <p> It was silent , then . <p> He thought it had been an odd conversation . <p> He wished later that he had n't told it they would come for it only because it cost money . It was from Earth , after all , and they were all a long way from Earth . They all needed each other if ever they were to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was so exhausted , and he did sleep for ten minutes - then it was on him , and he was cutting at it , slashing , cutting <p> And he saw blood : his blood . <p> It was frenzied then at the taste of his blood . He cut and cut and tried to run , dragging it after him , slashing at the stabbing tubes stretching for his leg . <p> He 'd cut through his biosuit . He held his breath and slashed his way free and ran . <p> His head was giddy with the pollen . Tying off the suit above the cut did no good : he 'd learned that human skin absorbed the chemicals in the pollen , though not as quickly as if he 'd breathed them . <p> " Lieutenant , " the comm unit said . <p> " Yes , " he said . <p> " You believe it will not follow you into cold places " <p> " It 's what I hope . " <p> " Mountains are not the only cold places . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the vine massed in the acres below him , following . <p> It was cold inside the cave . <p> " You can sleep here , " the comm unit said . <p> Yes , he thought . Surely he could sleep here . <p> When he woke , the cave was so quiet . Nothing was on him . Nothing was tugging at his feet or trying to choke him . His leg where he had cut himself ached , but his head was clear . <p> He took off his helmet and ate . He leaned back and slept again for a time . <p> When he woke and walked to the opening , the vine had choked the entrance shut . He could not bum his way out . He could not hold his breath long enough . Tendrils were crawling slowly down the cave toward his feet . <p> " Lieutenant ? " <p> The voice had been calling for some time . He struggled up , splashed water over the cloth around his face . <p> " Lieutenant ? " <p> His joints ached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he whispered . <p> " Rescue parties from the Scim - " <p> " When ? " <p> " Ten minutes ago . The initial party has flown to your cave . A second is here for the lander and me . They directed me to attempt to rouse you while they work . " <p> He said nothing . <p> " Are you dressed in what remains of your biosuit ? " <p> He felt around him for his helmet and the torn suit , but it was somewhere behind him , and he hurt . He felt so tired . <p> " How close is the vine ? " the computer asked . <p> " I do n't know . I turned off the torch - I ca n't see anything . " <p> The computer said nothing to that . It expected a more factual reply . But the torch was next to his helmet - he remembered that now . He 'd set the torch next to his helmet . <p> " How are you dressed ? How close is the vine ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but touched the vine . <p> " How close is the vine , lieutenant ? " <p> He jerked back , dropped the comm unit , stumbled into the water . <p> " How close is the vine , lieutenant ? Can you tell me ? " <p> " Close ! " He sank to his knees . The water rose barely above his waist . " Close . I ca n't see it in the dark . " <p> " Lieutenant , find out where it is and move away from it . " The voice was muffled . <p> He reached down to splash water over his face and touched a vine floating toward him in the water . " No ! " he shouted . He shoved it away and stumbled out of the pool . He kicked back the vine until he found his torch . The vine was everywhere in the gallery . He burned it until the fuel ran out . He heard buds popping open all around him in the darkness . <p> " Have you moved away from it , lieutenant ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back to the pool and splashed water over the cloth . He thought of his helmet and torn biosuit , but knew they would do him little good . He 'd seen the vine bore right through Brant 's suit . <p> " The initial rescue party should reach your part of the cave in approximately one hour and twenty-three minutes . " <p> He sank to his knees , shivering from more than the cold , his head so dizzy he could not stand . <p> " Lieutenant ? " <p> " Year " he said . <p> " I want you to make it . I have . You must . " <p> " I 've done everything I can . " <p> They were quiet for a time . The cold numbed him . <p> " Lieutenant ? " <p> " Do n't let them name this planet after me , " he said . <p> " They have already . " <p> He covered his face with his hands . He could smell the red flowers . <p> IMG        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
