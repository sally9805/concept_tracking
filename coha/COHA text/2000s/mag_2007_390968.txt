There was a time when visionaries in the worlds of music , the arts , and entertainment announced their rebellion not by wearing torn T-shirts and jeans but by embracing an aggressively formal style of dress . On the pages that follow , seven members of a new generation of mavericks combine their big ideas with a bold sense of style . The combination is unstoppable . Simon Hammerstein VAUDEVILLE REVIVALIST New York City is full of Big Names with Big Ideas , so when Simon Hammerstein  --  of the great theater clan  --  envisioned a vaudeville theater that would rescue nightlife from the tyranny of industrial megaclubs , he was easy to ignore . This kid , this twenty-something scion , had no real business doing any kind of business , having only directed a few off-off-Broadway plays with names like The Passion of George W. Bush . And yet he had this Big Idea , this place that would combine the spectacle of the Moulin Rouge with the eccentricity of Barnum &; Bailey and the glamour of Studio 54 . He named it the Box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice , he opened earlier this year in a refurbished abattoir on the Lower East Side . Exotic performers  --  burlesque ballerinas , circus oddities , and opera singers  --  take the stage for nightly shows , and the place is packed to the rafters eight days a week . " It 's like a scene out of Fellini , " Hammerstein says , " and it 'll keep changing .

John Connelly ART DEALER When John Connelly opened his namesake gallery in New York in 2002 , the air in Chelsea and other art-world environs felt toxic . " There was this cold-war mentality , where everybody was everybody 's enemy , " Connelly recalls . So with a few other bright-eyed comers , Connelly cofounded the New Art Dealers Alliance ( NADA ) to foster cooperation among the new generation of art professionals . Now with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals the most established international art fairs in prestige , Connelly and his fellow NADA members , once the scrappy upstarts , are players on the global stage . Jacket ( $895 ) , shirt ( $285 ) , and tie ( $125 ) by Pal Zileri ; pocket square ( $60 ) by Paul Stuart ; glasses ( $600 ) by Oliver Goldsmith . Ian Rowe MTV 'S ISSUE MAN To deride MTV for selling out musicians and taking up with reality TV is to ignore a fact central to its existence : The kids still watch it . And thanks to the efforts of Ian Rowe , who oversees the network 's social-programming unit , thinkMTV , it 's become a major source of news and information . " We use the power of the network to engage young people on issues of greatest concern to their generation , " explains Rowe . And so you have The Diary of Angelina Jolie and Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa and The Diary of Jay-Z : Water for Life , which are essentially PBS documentaries wrapped in Us Weekly clothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election coverage , set to begin anew this fall . You have the " It 's Your ( Sex ) Life " sexual-health campaign . You have Rowe making the best out of a celebrity culture and connecting with kids by any means necessary . " I do n't believe in apathy , " he says . " Young people want change , and we give them the tools to make it happen .

Daniel Katz FILM PRODUCER In 2005 , Daniel Katz helped bring a dirty , dirty , dirty joke into movie theaters around the world . As head of acquisitions for ThinkFilm , he purchased The Aristocrats after sensing its sky's-the-limit potential . He was right , of course , and his instincts concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spellbound and Half Nelson  --  seeing the light of day . Katz has since joined financial-services giant Guggenheim Partners , where he 's helping fund film producers working both inside and outside the studio system . " A lot of capital today is allocated to filmmakers who 've been successful over the past twenty-five years , " he says . " Our goal is to find who 's going to be successful over the next twenty-five . " If Katz 's past finds are any indication , this is good news indeed .

David Chang CHEF David Chang is a man of credentials . He graduated from a fancy culinary school . He 's cooked in hoity New York restaurants . He 's won awards . And yet four years ago , he left the world where all those credentials mattered . " I wanted to use what I 'd learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal dining , " he says . He opened Momofuku Noodle Bar and then Momofuku Ssm Bar in New York , tiny joints that reimagine ramen noodles and other Asian delicacies for the twenty-first century . " It 's all about the food , " he says , " and fuck everything else . " His customers tend to agree . Suit ( $1,484 ) and cotton shirt ( $139 ) by Paul Stuart ; tie ( $145 ) by Ermenegildo Zegna . Charlie Walk RECORD BREAKER " A few years ago , it felt like the end to a lot of people in my business , " says Charlie Walk , president of Epic Records . " But not to me . Never to me . " To be an optimist in the music industry seems like nice work for a masochist , but for Walk , whose artist roster ranges from Franz Ferdinand to Jessica Simpson , the digital revolution has meant opportunity and innovation . " The music business will always be based on hit songs and artists , " he says . " But you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Walk was an early advocate of personalized ring tones for cell phones and user-generated music videos . For better or worse , Walk believes , this is the future : " Music is going to be more profitable than ever , but we 'll just have a different way of doing it .

Charles Renfro ARCHITECT As one of three partners in the New York-based architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro , Charles Renfro often looks at the city around him and wonders . " Developers are just building and building without putting much thought into what they 're building , " he says . " Buildings make up our cities , and a lot of them make up our history . There needs to be some thought . " Renfro 's particular talent lies in both designing beautiful new structures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission to carry out the master plan for New York 's High Line park , with Renfro and company set to transform an abandoned elevated railway into a lush oasis . That 's why they 've been chosen to rework major portions of Lincoln Center . That 's why , unlike brand-name architects like Frank Gehry and Zaha Hadid , Renfro does n't have a signature aesthetic and prefers to adapt with each project . " I 've just always been interested in defying gravity , " he says . Our buildings , cities , and history are the better for it .
