June 1892 The Yampa Valley , Colorado <p> Crystal Clark gripped the side of the bouncing buckboard to keep from tumbling onto the rocky roadbed below . From the first moment she 'd left home she 'd been wondering if she 'd done the right thing by coming to Colorado . Maybe she should have remained in Georgia . At least there she knew what to expect . Out here the only person she knew was her aunt . Crystal had once thought her life was almost perfect , but in an instant , her father 's death had changed everything that she thought secure . <p> Rusty , her aunt 's driver , had been waiting in Steamboat Springs when she stepped off the stage . Now he pulled hard on the reins and stopped the horses on a rise that overlooked the Yampa valley . " Thought you might want to take a minute , enjoy the view up here . " <p> Crystal gazed at the unfolding vista resplendent with flaming Indian paintbrush and chickweed . Mountains loomed ahead . " What a breathtaking sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat and nostrils . Sweat ran in tiny rivulets down her back beneath her fitted corset and slithered its way down her clinging stockings into her snug-fitting heels . Despite these momentary inconveniences , crystal could only think about her heartache . <p> " It 's mighty pretty from up on this here rise . " He grinned . " I knew the minute Kate sent me to fetch you that you were gon na like it here , ma'am . " <p> Like it here ? she thought . <p> Still , crystal felt her lips turn up at the edges . Despite everything she 'd been through , rusty seemed to have the ability to make her smile . <p> " Kate said you 're coming here to stay , " he added . <p> Crystal frowned . She did n't know what she would be doing with her future , but in truth , she felt she had no alternative but to stay . <p> " I do n't know about staying ... That depends on a lot of things . " Crystal thought the old-timer a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missy , what 'd ya think of the mountains ? ai n't they somethin ' ? " <p> " They are so majestic , Rusty . God made beauty everywhere , did n't He ? " <p> " For a fact , ma'am . He did , He sure did . " He scratched his scruffy beard with his free hand . " It 'll be mighty nice to have a young person of the female persuasion around for a change . Being with cowboys all the time can wear on a man after a while . " He chuckled . <p> " Right now , I 'm afraid that I 'm just tired and looking forward to a good night 's sleep . " <p> " I hear you 're from Georgia . When 'd you start out ? " Rusty asked . <p> Crystal sighed . " Nearly two weeks ago . " Thinking back on it made her appreciate the settlers who had first come to this wild land years ago . " At Kansas I boarded the Rio Grande , which took me to Denver . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad to central city . Believe me , I was leaning as far back in my seat as possible when the engine hugged the edge of the mountains to start down . From Central City , I had to travel the rest of the way by stagecoach . " Crystal closed her eyes and thought back to how scared she had been when the stagecoach crossed over the continental divide and then labored over Rabbit Ears Pass . " I had trouble breathing up there and had a headache as well . " <p> " I know what you mean , missy . " <p> Inspired by the vastness of the beautiful valley nestled below the majestic snowcapped Rocky Mountains , Crystal soon forgot about her aching and stiff muscles . " Aunt Kate 's description of Colorado was accurate . This is very different from what I 'm used to . " <p> " So tell me , what is it like in Georgia ? I 've never traveled farther south than Denver , " Rusty said . <p> " Well , it 's heaven on earth to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide open like it is here , and we have lots of beautiful trees . Magnolias , dogwoods , oaks , and a variety of azaleas . Throw in humidity and you 'll get an idea of what it 's like . " <p> " What are azaleas ? " <p> " They 're bushes that bloom in early spring . Some are white , some are pink . Underneath the dogwood trees , they make a very pleasing picture . " <p> She felt hot tears spring behind her eyelids . Just talking about home made her chest tight . The day she had to sign the deed over to the bank , crystal thought her heart would break . No one , not even drew , had stepped in to help straighten out her finances . <p> Although drew wanted to marry her , something in her heart told crystal that she did not feel as deeply for him as he did for her . Maybe time apart from drew would give her a chance to know for sure what god had planned for her . <p> The old-timer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reins and guided the horses into the valley floor . " it sounds beautiful . " <p> Crystal could n't bear to keep talking about Georgia , and she changed the subject . " It 's been so long since I 've seen aunt Kate . But I have so many fond memories of her visits to Georgia . When she wrote , asking me to come for a visit , I wired her the same day and packed my bags . But I was n't sure what to expect . " <p> " Well , good for you . We 'll do our best to see you have a fine visit . Not much longer now , missy . And it wo n't always be this hot and dry , either . Reckon this is a shore sign of frost . Snow flies in September , sometimes late august here in the valley . Soon the pass will close . " <p> Crystal glanced at the man 's profile . Lines crinkled around his mouth on his weather-beaten face . He smiled at her , removed his hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red hair swirled around his head like a flame whipped by the wind . Rusty replaced his hat and stuffed his handkerchief into his shirt pocket . <p> Crystal smiled back weakly and sighed . " The closest thing to snow I 've seen in Georgia was flurries before a January ice storm . Tell me about the snow here . What 's it like ? " <p> " The winters here can be long and hard , especially on the livestock . I remember the blizzard of ' 87 that me and Kate weathered together . Your uncle had died two years before , you know . We had very little supplies to see us through . For ten days the world stood still , and the snow was six feet deep in places . Drifts reached to the roof of the house . That year most of the cattle either froze or starved to death . " He paused in his ruminating , and Crystal watched his face soften as he looked into the distance . <p> " The cattle got lean because of the drought during the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a chance . The snow so deep that our cowhands could n't reach ' em . We had n't counted on a summer drought with bitter snowfall on its heels . Our thermometer broke when it got thirty below . Kate read later on in the Steamboat Pilot that Montana recorded a minus forty-six degrees . Not sure what it was here . " <p> Crystal shuddered . " Why in heaven 's name would a person stay way out here , away from civilization , with a bunch of cows during a snowstorm in the first place ? " <p> Rusty chuckled . " Maybe you 'll change your mind after you 're here a spell . This here is god 's country . " <p> " Sounds perfectly miserable to me . " Crystal twirled her parasol , fanning her hot cheeks with a white lacy handkerchief . As far as she knew , the entire world was god 's country , but she understood what he meant . Crystal felt that way about Georgia . Oh well , it will just be a visit until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * <p> Late afternoon sun filtered through the ponderosa pine , lending a dappling effect to the surrounding junipers , sagebrush , and violet alpine asters . <p> " There 's Aspengold . Your aunt 's ranch was named after those shimmering trees in that grove to the rear of the house . " Rusty pointed to a rustic , sprawling ranch house . <p> Crystal followed the direction of his finger . The ranch was nothing like she expected . Unlike her father 's beautiful cotton plantation home with its huge white columns framed by giant oak trees , Aspengold was a low , almost flat log house with a porch running its full length . Not far from the house were corrals , a barn , and a smaller version of the main house , which Crystal guessed must be the bunkhouse from her aunt 's descriptive letters . The trees of white bark laden with black boles were nestled near the porch . The small , quaking leaves seeming to wave their greeting in the afternoon sunlight . <p> " Carmen 's spotted us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they snapped into a trot toward the ranch . In the distance , dogs started barking at the sound of the wagon rumbling down the dirt road . <p> Crystal saw a woman in a full red skirt run back into the house , then reappear with another woman whom she recognized as her aunt Kate . Crystal felt her chest tighten again . How in the world was she going to fit in with these folks and their simple life ? Maybe it would n't be for long-and maybe she 'd think again about drew . <p> As Rusty brought the wagon to a standstill in front of the veranda , the dogs yapped , and several cowboys appeared and swept off their hats in greeting . The tallest cowboy reached up to lift Crystal down , and she felt herself swing to the ground as though she were nothing more than a child . The cowboy towered above Crystal . She glimpsed confederate-blue eyes underneath dark eyebrows and thin lips below a thick moustache . For the briefest moment , their eyes held , and crystal felt strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Releasing her , he bowed with a ridiculous grin on his face . <p> Kate grabbed her niece and kissed her on the cheek . " Crystal , it sure is good to see you . You 're a sight for sore eyes , girl . " Kate pulled back . " Let me get a good look at you . I declare ! You 've grown up on me . The spittin ' image of your ma . " <p> Crystal felt her face turning pink . " It 's so wonderful to see you too . It 's been too long , has n't it ? " crystal smoothed the wrinkles of her skirt . " After that long , dirty ride , I must look a mess . " She pushed a few loose strands of dark , wavy hair back , knowing her face was dirt-streaked . <p> She looked up into Kate 's soft and full face , with hair grayer than she remembered four years ago . Kate Morgan was in her late forties , a strong , determined woman whose tall frame and husky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was n't a bigger heart in all of Colorado than her aunt 's . <p> Pulling Crystal forward by the elbow , Kate beamed with pride and announced , " This is my niece , crystal Clark , and I want all of you to make her feel welcome . " Kate gestured toward the tall cowboy who had helped crystal down from the wagon . " Meet Luke Weber-he 's my foreman . " <p> " Ma'am . " Luke touched the brim of his hat for a split second . <p> Crystal noticed that he did not remove his hat . So ungentlemanly . She stood straight and prim . " I 'm glad to make your acquaintance . " Crystal lowered her voice to a softer pitch , tilting her head up to look at Luke . She felt a little uneasy under his steady gaze but returned it with her own . <p> Standing well over six foot , Luke 's tall , lean frame belied his well-developed muscles suggesting years of working outdoors . A red bandana was knotted around his neck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dusty black boots , a little the worse for wear , held spurs at the heel , making a slight jingling noise each time he shifted his weight . <p> " And these here boys are Curly , Jube , and Kurt , the best ranch hands in these parts , " Kate said . <p> Crystal turned to greet curly , who was obviously named for his head of tight golden curls . Curly wiped his hands on his large bandana before he stepped toward her . He smiled . " Howdy . " <p> Crystal smiled back . " Hello . " <p> Jube kicked at a rock with the toe of his boot and , without looking directly at her , muttered hello , blushing to the roots of his scalp . <p> Kurt nudged between the two of them and took crystal 's hand to kiss it . " A real pleasure , ma'am , " he said without releasing her hand , " to meet a Southern belle , and a most exquisite one at that . " <p> Crystal noted his obvious good manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his . " It 's my pleasure to meet y'all . " They were quite a grubby band of boyish riders to her way of thinking , and she could n't help but notice that they all wore spurs . What a racket . <p> " What y'all gawking at ? " Kate gestured with her arms and fanned herself with her apron . " Rusty , get those bags in . Carmen , please bring us a glass of cool lemonade as soon as Crystal 's freshened up a bit . I 'm sure she 's about to parch . Crystal , this is Carmen . " Kate pulled forward a lovely Mexican girl , who flashed a suspicious look from her brooding dark eyes . Her large silver earrings glinted in the sunlight . <p> " Sf , seora . " Carmen turned on her bare feet to do Kate 's bidding . <p> Jube stepped up to help rusty unload Crystal 's suitcases . Curly and Kurt carried them to the porch , and the worn planks creaked under their weight . Luke stared at the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just rolled his eyes upward . <p> Kate laughed . " Well , I see you did n't bring enough change of clothes . " <p> " That trunk has my gowns , what 's left of them . Y'all do have parties out here , do n't you ? " <p> Jube looked at curly , who reached down to pick up an odd-shaped case , and then over to Luke , who shrugged his shoulders . <p> " We have a barn dance every now and then , " Kate replied . <p> " Oh ... " Disappointment sounded in her voice , but she wore her brightest smile . " I guess we 'll have to do something about that then , wo n't we ? " <p> Curly slammed her black case down , and Crystal rushed toward him . " Land sakes ! Please be careful with that . It 's my autoharp , and it 's easy to damage . " <p> " Your what ? " Curly 's face turned the color of a southwestern sunset as he shuffled his feet . <p> Crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known . " She lifted the case and patted it . " It 's a musical instrument . I promise to play it for y'all sometime , curly . How would that be ? " <p> " That 's a deal . " Curly smiled and pulled the last suitcase to the door . <p> The drovers just about fell all over themselves in an attempt to help with her baggage . A faint trace of gardenia hung in the air as crystal moved past the cowboys . Rusty and Luke just stood back and leaned against the fence to watch . <p> Crystal supposed she should be flattered by all the attention , but now she did n't think there would be much stimulating conversation or many parties way out here without neighbors for miles . and the dust . She hated it along with the dry heat . Luke , who looked amused by her very presence , was not what one would call sociable . He did n't seem to want to be bothered with her any more than she wanted to be in this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief and followed her aunt into the ranch house . Lord , what have I gotten myself into ? What did I expect ? <p> * * * <p> The cool water felt refreshing on her face and neck and revived crystal 's tired , dusty body . Patting herself dry with a thin towel , she noticed the room 's simplicity . A small fireplace stood opposite the bed with a crude rocker placed to one side . On the ancient , scarred , cherrywood bed were piled several colorful patchwork quilts , and atop the dresser was a pitcher cradled in a cracked rose bowl . A small lady 's desk sat beneath the window . Blue gingham curtains fluttered against the window frame . Someone had picked wild columbines and placed them on the nightstand , but now their petals drooped . Though different from her normal surroundings , she decided somehow this room seemed rather cozy . <p> She was determined to make the best of the situation . This was better than having everyone back home feel sorry for her . <p> She missed Lilly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covers back and laying out her nightgown . Crystal had begged her to come along , but Lilly would n't think of leaving the South and her family . All of a sudden , Crystal felt homesick . She sighed deeply then and wandered out into the narrow hallway . <p> The large front room was decorated with fine Indian pottery . Beautiful colored blankets adorned the walls , while an enormous fireplace of fieldstone boasted a huge elk head mounted above . Wood floors gleamed as afternoon sunlight spilled through spacious windows . Delicious smells wafted through the house and made her aware of her rumbling stomach . <p> By the time crystal stepped out onto the porch , just Kate and Carmen were sitting in rocking chairs . The ranch hands apparently had gone back to their respective chores . She assured her aunt that she felt human once again . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
