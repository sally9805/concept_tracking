Controlling a strategic juncture where the Silk Route crossed the Euphrates River , the city of Zeugma was one of the Roman Empire 's easternmost outposts  --  until it was torched by Persian invaders in A.D. 252 . But like the eruption that buried Pompeii two centuries earlier , the fire preserved a trove of mosaics , statuary and villas . Now Zeugma faces destruction again , this time from rising floodwaters of a hydroelectric project . " It is a wall-to-wall carpet of mosaics , richer and more important than Pompeii , " laments archaeologist Mehmet Onal . For a brief moment last week , Turkish officials hinted that the ruins might get a temporary reprieve , but those hopes vanished when the contractor announced that each month 's delay would add $30 million to the $1 billion project . For disappointed archaeologists the only recourse is to scramble to rescue as many of the objects as possible before they disappear below the water at the end of the month . <P>  --  By Andrew Finkel/Istanbul            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
