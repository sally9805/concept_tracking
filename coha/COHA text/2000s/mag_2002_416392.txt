Or , how a bookish Gringa learned to stop worrying and love el idioma . <p> IN THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE CHILDREN 'S series The Chronicles of Narnia , two brothers and two sisters travel through a wardrobe into a magic land where they are entertained by beavers . In the presence of these beavers ( who can talk ) , the children hear the name of " Aslan "  --  the powerful golden lion who ( they are told ) benignly watches over all the creatures of the realm . A warm , joyous feeling steals over the three good children , Lucy , Peter , and Susan , when they hear the name " Aslan . " But the bad child ( for alas , there is a bad child ) , Edmund , shudders with loathing when he hears the name . The syllables that delight his siblings make his flesh creep ; what they interpret as good , he interprets as threatening and sinister . Eventually , to the great relief of the beavers and everyone else , Edmund comes around . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juvenilia is that , as a .. child growing up in university towns in the Midwest and Southwest , I studied French and German and Latin with fervid devotion , but reacted to the sound of Spanish pretty much the same way Edmund reacted to the sound of Aslan . Even then , 20 years ago  --  before J. Lo and Shakira , John Leguizamo , Vicente Fox , Nuevo Latino cuisine , Y Tu Mam Tambin , and Penelope Cruz  --  even then , nobody would have refuted the fact that Spanish was a useful language for a North American to learn ; and I certainly accepted its popularity and practicality . Nonetheless , for me , Spanish lacked some indefinable prestige that I associated with other foreign languages . I had an illogical distaste for Spanish , and the Edmund/Asian parable is the best way to explain it . <p> I often have encountered other linguists , non-linguists , professors , and people in other professions who confess that they , too , dislike the sound of Spanish . " It 's ugly , " a typical Spanish-averse friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two other foreign languages  --  once declared to me without embarrassment . She passed on a bit of gossip she had heard and found amusing . Apparently , Ivana Trumps son , Donald Jr. , once told his mother he wanted to learn Spanish . " Why ? " she had retorted . " So you can speak with the servants ? " <p> Like her , anti-Espaol Americans do n't see the point of learning Spanish ( or , more tactfully , say they just do n't care for it ) . Well-meaning detractors say their objections are aesthetic ; although French is plenty nasal , it is Spanish that strikes them as nasal in an unpleasant way . Although German is guttural , it is Spanish that they find unpleasantly guttural . Russian sounds slurred , but it is Spanish whose slurredness bothers them . It is an irrational mindset . It 's worth " sharing " this with you , as Dame Edna might say , only because a sizable minority of Americans still have the Edmund/Asian hangup about Spanish . <p> The Spanish language suffers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southwestern and urban impressions of Hispanicity that sink the language and culture in the grim border zones of Texas and California and in the ghettoes and elevators of metropolises . A study on a touchy subject like this probably never has been conducted , but the **25;1666;TOOLONG of my acquaintance ( including my Hispanic friends who intentionally choose not to understand Spanish even though it was their parents ' first language ) associate the sounds of Spanish with negative qualities-not evil ones , like violence , anger or malice  --  but weaknesses , like laziness , passivity , poor education , anti-intellectualism , and a perverse refusal to enunciate . <p> It May seem counterintuitive to assert that the Spanish language has a bad reputation in this country , when you consider that , as of the last census , there were some 35 million self-described Hispanic-Americans residing here , and that projections show these numbers will only increase . The papers report that forward-looking Bobos , eying long-term demographic and employment trends , are now jousting to get their kids into Spanish-concentration magnet schools . The president sprinkles Spanish ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches ; politicians in southern states like Texas carry on entire debates in Spanish . Of the 1.2 million American college students who studied a foreign language in 1998 , more than 650,000 of them  --  more than half  --  took Spanish . <p> Nonetheless , several authorities on American cultural trends agree that ingrained animosity towards Spanish persists in pockets throughout this society : from the Europhiles in the upper echelons who find the language dclass to the middle-classic Hispanic-Americans who want to shed their hyphenated backgrounds ( or want their children to ) , to the struggling laborers in the lower strata who resent the growing Hispanic presence in the American workforce and see the Spanish language as the embodiment of their competition . <p> " This goes back to high school in the 1950s , " says Joseph Epstein , lecturer in English and writing at Northwestern University and author of the new book Snobbery : The American Version . " In the old days , the brightest kids took Latin , the dullest kids took Spanish and women took French . If you wanted to do science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the rest , there was Spanish " The old , informal language channeling system has eroded , and Spanish is now popular among both male and female students . Four years ago , nearly six million of America 's 13.5 million public high school students were studying Spanish . And yet , Ilan Stavans , the Lewis-Sebring Professor in Latin American and Latino Culture at Amherst College and author of The Hispanic Condition , firmly believes that the old prejudice lives on . " The perception of Spanish as a language of barbarians , of not fully civilized citizens , has remained with us , even though Spanish is . in any college the most popular language . We still retain the impression that if you learn French or German , you 're going to be closer to the heart of things Western . " <p> Indeed , historically , Americans and Europeans alike have often skipped Spain when they considered countries responsible for the creation of Western culture . A casual scan of high culture tells the story : Nearly all the great operas still performed are sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In classical music , non-Spanish European composers predominate : Rossini , Beethoven , Chopin , Mozart , Bach . Great literature ? With the single exception ( and what an exception ! ) of Cervantes , the canon does not speak Spanish ; Stendhal , Balzac , Goethe , Mann , Tolstoy , Dante , Dickens , Chaucer , and others drown it out . In art , Goya and Velzquez stand alone amid a United Nation's-worth of Frenchmen , Italians , Germans , and Dutch . Needless to say , there have been significant Spanish contributions to Western culture , even if we do n't know here exactly what they were  --  it was probably a P.R . problem all along . But until the 20th century , the Spanish influence on Western culture was certainly under-emphasized . <p> Over the last 100 years , the cultural record has slowly broadened and Hispanicized  --  largely thanks to the oeuvre of the three Pablos  --  Casals , Picasso , and Neruda . Over the last four decades , the Spanish-speaking newcomers to the evolving canon have mostly come from Central and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American hemisphere 's brand of Spanish . Pablo Neruda won his Nobel Prize in 1971 , Gabriel Garcia Marquez won his in 1982 , Octavio Paz won his in 1990 . When you add to these high culture contributors the unending list of Hispanic pop culture figures who have gained prominence here since , say , Ramn Estevez became Martin Sheen , it 's easy to understand why North Americans now think of Spanish as a language that is spoken south of the border , not south of the Pyrenees . <p> In other words , for Norteamericanos , Spanish now registers as a non-European language  --  as opposed , for example , to French . For Americans , French still evokes the country of France in a way that Spanish does not evoke Spain . The idea of Frenchness still evokes elitism , privilege , the diplomat class , savoir-faire and luxury  --  the gamine Gigi learning how to spot good emeralds while Maurice Chevalier warbles leeringly nearby . The idea of Spanishness has come to evoke Mexico , Puerto Rico , Jennifer Lopez , and support for the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , part has been intentional . In U.S. colleges in the ' 60s and afterward , an ideological divide formed between people who studied Spanish for literary and aesthetic reasons  --  old-schoolers  --  and people who supported Spanish because they opposed U.S. Latin American policy ( think Castro , Pinochet , the Sandinistas , Che Guevara )  --  new-schoolers . The old- schoolers ( who sometimes liked to study French , or Greek , or Russian , or Chinese ) wanted to preserve the study of languages for its own sake . The new-schoolers saw language as a political statement . The Harvard student who learned Spanish in 1975 often did so to follow Che 's motorcycle route on a South American road trip . The girlfriend who accompanied him might have studied French , but she did n't want her boyfriend to think she was a snob , so she took Spanish instead . She wanted to seem like a woman of the people . <p> Like the girlfriend , today 's politicians have found that a Spanish vocabulary is useful for disguising silver-spoon roots and expressing solidarity with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from a famously privileged background and had a diplomat-class upbringing  --  demonstrated this in May at a press conference in Paris , when he scolded an American news reporter for having had the effrontery to ask President Jacques Chirac a question in French . Bush huffed to the crowd , " Very good , the guy memorizes four words , and he plays like he 's intercontinental " When the reporter , stunned by the hostility , countered that he knew many more than four words of French , the president 's disgust only mounted : " I 'm impressed . Que bueno ( how great ) , " he said snidely . He clearly meant it to sting  --  a not-so-veiled suggestion that the reporter was a member of the effete liberal class that was responsible for all that 's wrong with American politics . At his birthday this July in Kennebunkport , Bush wore a baseball cap printed with the words " El jefe " ( the chief ) . The message was clear : French is poncey , show-offy , elitist . But Spanish is all-American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore up his regular-guy bona fides , a significant portion of the nation 's elite stilt does not look forward to an America when " Yo quiero Taco Bell " will lisp from every television screen , and Shakira will replace Edith Piaf as soundtrack of choice for smoky cafes . Joseph Epstein discovered how strong the resistance to pro-Spanish peer pressure can be in late June , when he discussed his snobbery book on the National Public Radio call-in show " Talk of the Nation ? ' ' A woman called up who was a high school French teacher , and she seemed ticked off at the spread of Spanish , " Epstein recalled . " She said she felt Spanish was being emphasized at the expense of French and that it was being emphasized in a kind of multicultural , and  --  oddly enough  --  non-Western way . She felt there was a kind of ' We must all learn Spanish now because we have so many Spanish countrymen ' thing going on that had a kind of rudeness about it  --  whereas she felt French was a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sympathize with the French teacher . As I grew older , I chose again and again not to study Spanish , preferring languages that to me seemed more exotic . The notion that the comparative ease of the Spanish language might actually recommend it for study eluded me  --  in the superego phase of life , what does not seem hard can seem not worth doing . When my open-minded father learned Spanish , I stopped my ears when he played his language tapes and repeated perro ( dog ) 20 times . I loved foreign languages , but did n't think Spanish counted as one . In Oklahoma , where I went to high school , many of the Hispanic kids in the high school took Spanish for an easy " A " or " B " because they already spoke it at home . " Villa Allegre " was on television , and on " Sesame Street " they taught us abierto and cerrado and peligro . Ads for sazn Goya ran alongside ads for Coca-Cola and Cottonelle . What was exotic about that ? <p> As my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and added Russian and Italian . When I acquired friends from Puerto Rico or Mexico , they spoke to me in Spanish , and I responded in Italian or French . I was n't a xenophobe ; I traveled great distances in search of immersion in other cultures  --  to France , Germany , Italy , Russia , Africa , Japan  --  but avoided Mexico and Spain . When I went to Central America , I chose Belize , the only English-speaking country on the landmass . In New York City , where I moved after college , I assumed that the subway signs in Spanish , the Spanish newspapers , and the Spanish-speaking people around me had nothing to communicate that I could n't ignore . Don Quixote and A Hundred Years of Solitude were available in translation , Death in the Afternoon was written in English in the first place , and I figured that would hold me . But then , like Edmund , I came around . <p> These days , Spanish is my favorite foreign language . The irrational mindset I once had against Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I love Spanish more than French , more than Russian , more than Italian ( nobody loves German ) . I subscribe to the bi-weekly Spanish-language glossy women 's magazine Vanidades , read it from cover to cover , and cook the recipes in it . Over the last two years , I have read and spoken so much Spanish that my French is now changed : I unconsciously say when I mean to say et . The weight and rhythms of Spanish expression transport me ; its physicality , drama , and lack of trumpery I find breathtaking . I just ca n't get enough . Illogical as this turnaround may be , I would like to try to break it down for the diehard Edmund/Aslan/anti-Espaol contingent , to see if I ca n't convert them , too . La Belle Epoque <p> Every time you speak another person 's language , you wrap your mind around another way of contemplating the world . Language dictates perception . You can not frame what you see , or what you think , without coding it into language . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but preening language  --  judgmental but insincere . It is best used to spout longwinded , more-or-less empty intellectual declarations , to issue artistic judgments , or to unwrap pretty curlicues of flattery and praise . Part of the problem is that too much rhymes in French . Willy-nilly , you find yourself putting together words that sound good paired . Try to speak in French for 10 minutes without praising or criticizing something immoderately , or without saying something you do n't actually mean . It ca n't be done . It 's a language of persiflage and artifice , in which , even when you mean to build a simple cabin of words , you end up with a wedding-cakey Garnier opera . <p> Russian is a sentimental , even mawkish , language , richly mined with hidden menace and self-deceptions . Consider only two of Russian 's aural confusions : Lubyanka , the longtime headquarters of the KGB , sounds very much like liubyashy , which means " loving . " Lyubit means love , ubit means kill . Does Kyrill lyubit or ubit you ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the word Mama more frequently than probably is healthy for grown-ups . Furthermore , it 's vaguely distressing the way the Russian language exaggerates and caresses dreary realities . For instance , a nice-looking woman is called a " bread-roll , " bulochka . The language even contains a specific , affectionate term to describe the endearing ( to Russians ) wetness of a baby 's diaper , mokrinky . Meanwhile , the word mokritsy , different only by one consonant cluster from mokrinky , means woodlice . You see the trouble . <p> Italian 's rolling flow invites exaggeration  --  with your mouth forming o 's all the time , you find yourself incessantly thinking about food , or marvelling at things . The German language 's severing of verb from subject maroons you in gray , indeterminate thought , plunging you into existential worry  --  does anyone or anything matter ? You could find out at the end of the sentence , if you could keep yourself awake  --  sorry , that is : if you still yourself awake keep could . And no matter what you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you have managed to absorb these capriciously drawn psychological language Rorschachs ( feel free to edit and personalize them according to your own individualized takes ) , you can recognize that any scene or situation you might wish to describe has a separate identity that depends upon , and is constrained by , the language you use to evoke it . Each translation calls up a different scene because each language apprehends a different reality . At the moment , the Spanish reality is the one I would choose . <p> My amour fou for the Spanish language began six years ago and has been building ever since . In 1996 , a friend insisted I rent a video of a Spanish bedroom farce called Belle Epoque . Watching the coquetterie of four sisters in a sun-dusted country house , all of them vying for the romantic attentions of one guileless young man , I finally saw that there was a Spanish culture that had nothing to do with blood , bulls , Civil War , lunch delivery , or frijoles . And in the sultry susurro ( whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their philandering mother , I finally heard that the Spanish language was suitable for romance , when the lovestruck youngest sister , Luz , lost all patience with the strapping stranger ( who had bedhopped from one sister to the next , always skipping her ) and finally screeched at him , " Y yo qu ? ! " ( And what about me ? ! ) I was dumbfounded . What about her ? What about Spanish ? why all the others and not her ? Why all the other languages and not Spanish ? Why indeed ? <p> That movie started the thaw , and also coincided with the crossover of a number of Hispanic cultural phenoms on the North American scene : Ricky Martin , J. Lo , and , of course , Penelope Cruz . Soon after seeing Belle Epoque , I bought a copy of Pablo Neruda 's Memoirs . Then Octavio Paz . A couple years later , when friends suggested we go to a Latino dance bar , I went willingly . It was there I received the turbo-boost to this thawing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South American boyfriend , the scion of a family of plantation owners , who rode horses , surfed , did something in finance , read Noam Chomsky , instructed me to thank the Seor ( God ) every day for the joy of being alive , and told me , without any anxiety ( at my prompting ) that , on the whole , he thought it would be prettier if I grew my nails and had long blond hair , but he did n't mind if I did n't feel like it . He called me every endearment in the diccionario and looked like Beast-master , so I indulged him . His clarity , directness and warmth came to symbolize for me the qualities of the Spanish language . So many other languages are good for dissembling ; Spanish is good for revealing . <p> Because of this boyfriend , who was far too laissez-faire to bother teaching me , I began to learn Spanish by reading my favorite novels in Spanish translation : Graham Greene 's The Heart of the Matter , Balzac 's Pre Gorior . I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and verbs that I thought were Spanish ; but as I read and learned further , I began to integrate the Spanish from my reading into my speaking . I would memorize and recite entire phrases from El Revs de la Trama ( The Heart of the Matter ) and try them out for sheer drama . " Ya crea que habamos terminado con eso , " I would say gravely ( " I thought we had finished with that " ) . It was so finn . Kind of harsh , but so real , and playful under it all . The boyfriend would laugh at me . Before long , I was speaking in Spanish , period , though none too correctly , and my Italian was gone . <p> The best side effect hit me on the New York City streets . I felt like a child who had read a favorite book over and over , not realizing it was pop-up . Everywhere I went , a parallel New York seemed to emerge from the streets I already knew ; in bars , libraries , bodegas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been going on all along , all the years I 'd lived here , only I had n't heard it . I began to notice the difference in cadence and speed and intent between Puerto Rican Spanish , Madrileo Spanish , Argentine , Chilean , Mexican , Dominican . There was so much to learn and absorb . Once when the boyfriend and I were chatting , sitting on a picnic blanket in a park in Brooklyn , a man at the next blanket over , sitting with his kids and his dog , leaned over to joke with us because his dog was sprawled on its back on the grass , paws in the air , with a ridiculous expression on its face . " El perro est muy cansado ... " the man said jokily . " The dog is exhausted " The television acquired new channels  --  Spanish news , dubbed movies , bizarre variety shows . I never learned the future tense in Spanish , but my boyfriend said that was sensible , because he would be leaving soon . Novio , the word for boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word , deslizarse , which means to slip out of some entanglement  --  " like a lizard " was my mnemonic . The word enchanted me . The whole Spanish vocabulary seemed runic , like incantations  --  disfrutar , to enjoy , evoked ripe fruit ; malapalabra  --  bad word  --  sounded like a magic spell . Caderas meant " hips " and sounded triumphant , and sturdy and profemininity . Salpimentar meant to salt-and-pepper something . Joy , food , bodies , spiciness , undercurrents , movement , efficiency , acceptance . <p> After the boyfriend moved , I discovered the defiant ballads of the Peruvian pop star Shakira . Her song , " Ciega Sordomuda "  --  " Blind , Deaf and Dumb "  --  which sounds like an Alanis anthem sung by Linda Ronstadt  --  intoxicated me : " Bruta , ciega , sordomuda , torpe , traste , testaruda ; es todo lo que he sido , pot ti me he convertido en una cosa que no hace otra cosa mas que amarte ... " ( " Ugly , blind , deaf and dumb , torpid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been since you turned me into something that can do nothing but love you " ) The strength in admitting weakness amazed me . She was so abject , but so cheeky  --  unafraid of pain . Not sentimental or dippy like an American or French lovesong  --  passionate , a little crazy , and vaguely threatening . When I try to convince my Spanish-resistant friends of the virtues of Vanidades or Shakira , I meet with limited success . But what they think does n't matter . No lesser an authority than Paul Fussell , author of the Bible of the American caste system , Class , told me , " I believe quite sincerely that in 50 years Spanish will be the absolute equal of English as a social and financial and serious alternative to English in this country . America will be bilingual , absolutely . The bright people will be " My fervent hope is that , despite my new-found love of Spanish , the bright people will be trilingual  --  English , Spanish , and something else , too . <p> Last summer I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a British friend who is still caught in the grip of the Edmund/Asian anti-Espaol spell . Tapas distressed her ; sangria struck her as " naff . " And when , at two in the morning at a disco in Alicante , we found ourselves talking to the son of a bullfighter and his entourage  --  she finally took me aside and exploded , " WHY must we keep talking to all these ... Spanish people ! " I looked at her sympathetically , remembering what it had been like . " Because , we are in Spain , " I responded . What else could I say ? One day , like Edmund and Aslan , she 'll come around . She will have to do it on her own . It will be gradual , but once it starts , it wo n't stop . And I say ... arriba . <p> By Liesl Schillinger <p> <p> LIESL SCHILLINGER is writer based in New York City . <p>
