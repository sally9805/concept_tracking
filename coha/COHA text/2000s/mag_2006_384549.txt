For a small band of shrinks , intervening in catastrophic situations is an everyday event . But their experience at the edge has deep consequences for us all : It is Altering our understanding of the true nature of human nature . Photograph // Those who to the human psyche are experts in our internal dramas , which are generally invisible to the naked eye . They give us tools to subdue our anxieties , lift plummeting moods and mop up our quotidian emotional messes. * A rare few populate therapeutic realms inhabited exclusively by men and women who are thrust against the very limits of human adaptability . These professionals deal with people whose dramas are enough to make front-page news . * Call them extreme psychologists . Psychology Today tracked down five whose work takes them into often-uncharted depths of human nature . Most are rewriting the textbook of human behavior as they go . * One examines American soldiers who acted unspeakably in Iraq 's Abu Ghraib prison . Another helps cult members break free . Yet another probes the memories of people whose experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another has found the secret that allows victims of terrorism and catastrophes to emerge stronger than ever . And one plucks couples from the abyss of marital dissolution . By working at the margins of human experience , they illuminate the most basic psychological needs of us all . 1 Out of This World but Not Out of Their Minds SUSAN CLANCY 'S CLOSE encounters with the third kind began a decade ago , by proxy . A psychology fellow at Harvard , she was searching to find a verifiable way to study the conditions under which people do-or do not-create fake memories . What she found was how far people go to make sense of experience . In 1996 , she had begun work with women who had repressed and " recovered " vivid memories of sexual abuse , applying well-known tests designed to show if some were more prone to re-create memories . She tested subjects and control groups who said they were either never sexually abused or had never forgotten their abuse . All were asked to study , memorize and then recite back a list of semantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word sweet . On the list were candy , sugar , cookie and brownie , for example , but never actually the word sweet . Photograph ALIEN ARDOR : Abductees find deep meaning in their alleged ordeals. // Everybody had a tendency to think that the " nonpresent critical word " - sweet- was on the list " But the women who claimed to have recovered memories of sex abuse were significantly more likely than the control groups to be very , very confident that the critical word sweet was on that list , " Clancy found . " The bottom line is that they created a false memory and not only believed it , but were very confident in their belief . " The research set off a firestorm . " All I said was that if women were more prone to create false memories in the lab , it was also a possibility they had outside the lab , too . I was accused of protecting pedophiles . " Ultimately , there was no workable way to corroborate the abuse stories . She needed " a better , safer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to alien abductees . " Here were intelligent , highfunctioning , nonreligious people , free of brain damage or major trauma , yet with vivid memories of something that to a high degree of certainty did not happen . " The same tests yielded the same results . The only big difference between abductees who created false memories in hypnosis , those who said they were abducted but had no memory of it , and a control group who had never thought they were abducted was that the false-memory group scored higher in fantasy proneness . The " recovered-memory " abductees overall were far more likely to remember sweet with complete certainty and to believe false memories that were suggested or imagined in detail with the help of testers . Few abductees remembered the abduction itself . Most just believed it on the basis of symptoms , Clancy says . " They would say " I woke up and could n't move for 30 seconds , ' or they discovered a strange pattern of moles on their skin . Then they would conclude that they " feel different now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad dream , a physical ailment , sleep problems or just a coincidental set of symptoms , they attributed the phenomena to an abduction . Initially , the abductees sought therapy for the psychological and physical trauma they " experienced . " But once past the pain and terror , Clancy found , " they felt special , that something chose them and they were important , and they felt that scientists " do n't know everything . " " False as the abductions maybe , they play a real role in the psychological lives of those who believe in them . Further , they expose a universal need . " It 's human for people to seek psychological explanations for why they feel alone , sad , lost or put down , " Clancy observes . " We do n't all choose alien abductions that focus on trauma , anal probes and all the creepy stuff , but we all seek some kind of explanation for what we experience . Being abducted is culturally available ; aliens are all over the media . My child at age two could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abductees the same need you and I have to Relieve in something bigger than ourselves . " They want meaning . And do n't we all ? Their experience makes them human , not weird . " Therapists called upon to treat anyone for postabduction trauma would do well to respect that , she notes . Then abductees can be helped to understand themselves and their lives , even if the memory of what happened to them is n't valid . 2 The Evil Withinand Without IN CHARGE OF the night shift in a part of Iraq 's Abu Ghraib prison known as the " hard site , " Ivan " Chip " Frederick could have stopped the abuse that famous night in 2003 , he later admitted . But the 38-yearold former staff sergeant , whose 12-year sentence is on appeal , took part instead , forcing prisoners to masturbate and punching one man so hard he needed medical help . He also hooked wires to the hands of a detainee , who was told he would be electrocuted if he fell off a box . Philip Zimbardo was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us have a self-serving illusion , " says the Stanford University psychologist , whose 1971 landmark study of prison society famously demonstrated the power of circumstance to hijack morality . " We say we 'd be good guards or heroic prisoners , that we ca n't imagine how guards at Abu Ghraib did this . " But he can . Zimbardo grew up in the South Bronx- " a skinny , sickly kid with a funny , big nose , picked on by other kids . " Survival meant using his brains to learn the " psychology of street smarts , " becoming an " intuitive personality theorist who sized up other kids very fast to figure out who was a friend and who was dangerous . " That led to " understanding the dynamics of power , which kid had it and how to make it work for me and not against me . " With a Ph.D . in psychology from Yale , and his mean-streets training Zimbardo found himself exploring how ordinarily decent people could do evil . " This was not a philosophical question for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students into a prisonlike setting , some as guards , some as inmates . He watched as shifts in power and circumstances messed with personal identities , distorting and overwhelming deeply held values and moral codes . Photograph TRIGGER POINT : War zones can be a crucible for evil . // " The lesson was that the human mind is a template for virtually anything , capable of heroic or evil acts , " he says . Within " deindividuation , " a temporary state of suspended personal identity , lie the ordinariness of evil and the banality of heroics . " Most people who do evil-or a heroic act-do it unpredictably , only once and in a particular time or place , " he says . This suggests that many are looking for evil in the wrongplaces , including in " bad seed " personalities . Frederick , for example , supervised 12hour night shifts for 40 nights with no day off amid stress , prison filth , lack of sunlight , missed meals , absence of socialization , fear of bombings , escape attempts , zero mission-specific training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him that is other than norma , " says Zimbardo . " No sadism . Nine medals . An allAmerican poster boy of patriotism who became a monster . This was not a case of a bad apple , but of bad bough makers . " Zimbardo stresses that Frederick is responsible for his acts . But , he says , " Abu Ghraib was a crucible for evil and those who try to predict evil by linking personality traits rooted in everyday normal situations to samples of evil behavior at a particular time are on a fool 's errand . " In his forthcoming book , The Lucifer Effect : Under standing How Good People Turn Evil , Zimbardo points out that Lucifer was once God 's favorite angel . " Everywhere I 've looked , I 've found transformations of ordinary people into evil ones , " he says . " The gold ring wo n't be found in predicting the unpredictable , but in figuring out triggers and altering them . Not in trying to change the nature of human capabilities , but in understanding what drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEVEN ALAN HASSAN was 19 and depressed , a college dropout who had just broken up with his girlfriend . He was lonely and working at a nearby Holiday Inn when a trio of attractive young women approached him on his college campus . Dressed like students and carrying books , they talked about classes , flirted and got him to talk about himself . Over several days , they described the good life living with people from all over in a group house . They reassured him he would love it there , that there were big ideas afoot that could include him and that their only agenda was to help each other save the world . " I had no idea that what was happening to me was a systematic , well-planned manipulation and seduction and that I had been targeted , " he says . So , in 1973 , Hassan became a member of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon 's Unification Church . For more than two years , the Moonie was subjected to " overwhelming psychological , physical and emotional torture . " He rose quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " what country I wanted to run when we took over the U.S. and , ultimately , the world . " Photograph SWEPT AWAY : Preying on the weak to their numbers . // But his " boringly normal " Jewish family never stopped worrying about him and seized a moment of opportunity . Working almost nonstop to raise money for the cult , he had fallen asleep at the wheel , crashed and was hospitalized with a broken leg and chest injuries . Dazed and unsure about what would happen to him , he called his sister Thea . " I made her promise not to tell my parents . Fortunately she broke her word . " Hassan became an expert witness in the U.S. government 's investigation of the 1978 Jonestown massacre in Guyana . He turned over Moon 's speeches , believing the parallels to Jim Jones ' cult would help expose the Unification Church 's methods . Today , as a licensed mental health counselor , he 's a role model for cult-member clients . He does n't so much get people out of cults as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaches them about mind control . He creates a support team of family and friends . Everyone gets homework . " If the brother of a cult member says his brother tried to recruit him and he replied that the cult member was nuts , I ask him to think about when he last called his brother just to say he missed him and to do that instead . " His own experience and careful observation have taught him that people do n't join cults , they are targeted and seduced by well-trained political , religious or other opportunists who know exactly on whom to prey-smart , well-educated youth who have a hard time getting themselves out of stressful , disappointing or depressing situations . They fall victim to those who take them back to the feelings they had as children , when their needs were met by all-knowing adults . " The recruiters spend time with you , comfort you , take the time to get to know a lot about you even before a face-to-face meeting . You feel wanted , desirable , chosen , special , useful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was Satan and despaired at the evil place that was the world outside . Cults get you to be confabulators of your own history . " His coaching aims to " get people to start thinking again , comparing what they 've been told to reality-to motivate those whose minds have been closed to a painful real world to open their minds again . Hassan asks that families not wait if they think their young have been swept up in a cult or have begun to pay attention to people who belong to secretive organizations . " These people have n't made an informed choice , they have been recruited and enslaved . The sooner you act , the better . " 4 Seeking the " Gift in the Horror " Photograph THE 9/11 CONNECTION : In the midst of horror , New Yorkers comfort one another . // JUST AFTER DARK , on October 28 , 1989 , Aloha Island Air Flight 1712 took off from Maui with eight athletes from Molokai High School and two of their teachers among the 20 passengers . Minutes later , it crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were killed . The casualties in the close-knit community included the living as well as the dead . Lloyd Yonemura , for example , believes that athletic director John Ino took the fatal flight so that he would n't miss a basketball game with him the next day . For psychologist Claude Chemtob , the guilt and helplessness that Yonemura experienced-in fact , the entire disaster-became an instruction manual in human resilience , with lessons for coping with mass catastrophes like 9/11 . Called to Molokai because of his sensitive handling of an earlier crash , his task was to identify those at high risk for severe psychological trauma and to help others begin the process of recovery . Born in Egypt to parents made refugees by the Suez Crisis in 1956 , Chemtob grew up sensitized to the response of ordinary people to life-threatening situations . These days , he shuttles between Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York and Honolulu , where he directs a research laboratory at the Pacific Islands Division of the National Center for PTSD . Disasters and trauma , whether singular events or chronic threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliative part of it , " Chemtob finds . They bring out altruism and self-sacrifice , emotions normally hidden in everyday life . Nocauldron of unformed instincts erupts-except enormously well-organized impulses . " Our primitive essence is not wild and disorganized , he argues . " We have the capacity to form ties , to help and to connect . " Such impulses facilitate recovery . Chemtob'spostdisaster experience has led him to one sure conclusion : It is necessary to help victims find " the gift in the horror . " For recovery to begin , people need to exercise the powerful impulse to bond , to touch , to need one another , to create something positive in a nightmare experience-but it can happen only if they are first allowed to get as close to the pain as they wish . Early in the aftermath of a disaster , he has found , people are grateful to have outside help . But unless the helpers mobilize locals , the community will eventually want to exclude the helpers because of embarrassment and feelings of helplessness and ineffectiveness . " Only they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way of getting an entire community to feel it has come out better for the experience . " The common impulse of outsiders to " protect " parents from seeing their maimed children is misguided , Chemtob says ; he particularly remembers one father who sneaked into a morgue to see his daughter . " There is apowerful human need to touch and seethelovedoneandtofcnow the loved one died , " he contends . " Soldiers will sacrifice their own lives to not leave bodies behind ; in mass trauma people ca n't otherwise accept that the experience is real . We need affirmation . " France and Israel each have coordinated emergency response systems : " People come out feeling stronger and more resilient " Americans do n't feel more capable , stronger or better organized post9/11 or post-Katrina , helaments . " We have utterly failed to pay attention to what humans can do at times like this , and to provide support for them to do it . " 5 The Last Gasp for Relationships HE IS USUALLY successful , blatantly ill-behaved , hyperjudgmental , focused on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In feet , grandiose in beliefs and pronouncements , he looks down his nose at her " neediness " and brings his outside-the-world , above-the-rules stance home . She is disdainful of her mate but silences her sense of superiority . Unwilling to risk losing her man , she shrinks from putting real demands on the table , instead erupting over side issues that leave him clueless . Given his unwillingness to work on the relationship , she either withholds sex or offers the silent treatment . Typically they 've been married for decades , were once deeply in love and have been through multiple rounds of marital counseling . For Massachusetts-based marital therapist Terence Real , that 's part of the problem . Most couples counselors do n't take sides . That leaves them " ignoring the obvious , " which , Real insists , is why everyone gets precisely nowhere . Like a battle-toughened Special Forces operative , Real drops behind enemy lines in a last-ditch attempt to keep couples from self-destructing . In an intense 48-hour fusillade , he is aggressive in pointing fingers at bad behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortcomings . And when he takes sides , it 's usually with her against him . What he says typically sounds something like this : " Harry , you have a problem . You 're a rager and even Mother Teresa would n't want you . How do you expect your wife to sleep with you ? " The problem , Real finds , is that today 's women are invariably asking for more intimacy than men are trained to give . " The great unspoken secret of bad marriages is that men are not unhappy about their marriages but about the fact that women are so unhappy with them . " Its corollary is that women have a right to be unhappy with them . " When women say they want men more connected , more responsive and more in tune and expressive , it is not appropriate for a therapist to then turn to the men and ask " Now , what do you want ? " What 's needed is to turn to the guy with empathy and say OK , you were n't trained in relationship skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and healthier for you . ' And the wife needs to stop scolding him for not doing what he does n't know how to do . " Photograph THE BIG UNEASY : Brash billionaire Ron Perelman dumped fourth wife Ellen Barkin. // Connecting requires that men give up their grandiosity , and Real admits that 's a toughie-because grandiosity feels so great . But it makes men tonedeaf to others ' needs . So he delivers a crash course in remedial empathy and the healthy ego . Real has done no formal follow-up with clients after they go back home . But his office reports that nine out of 10 leave recommitted . His message for women : Stop being coy and nasty and put demands on the table firmly and considerately . To men , he says : Stop whining about conflict , take up the yoke and learn to do some of the heavy lifting that women have always been taught to do and do well .
