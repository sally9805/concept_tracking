Chapter One The voice on the phone was a whisper . It had a forceful , almost desperate quality to it . Henry Pierce told the caller he had the wrong number . But the voice became insistent . " Where is Lilly ? " the man asked . " I do n't know , " Pierce said . " I do n't know anything about her . " " This is her number . It 's on the site . " " No , you have the wrong number . There is no one named Lilly here . And I do n't know anything about any site . Okay ? " The caller hung up without responding . Then Pierce hung up , annoyed . He had plugged in the new phone only fifteen minutes earlier and already he had gotten two calls for someone named Lilly . He put the phone down on the floor and looked around the almost empty apartment . All he had was the black leather couch he sat on , the six boxes of clothes in the bedroom and the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem . Nicole had kept everything-the furniture , the books , the CDs and the house on Amalfi Drive . She did n't keep it , actually : he had given it all to her . The price of his guilt for letting things slip away . The new apartment was nice . It was high luxury and security , a premier address in Santa Monica . But he was going to miss the house on Amalfi . And the woman who was still living in it . He looked down at the phone on the beige carpet , wondering if he should call Nicole and let her know he had moved from the hotel to the apartment and had the new number . But then he shook his head . He had already sent her the e-mail with all the new information . To call her would be breaking the rules she had set and he had promised to follow on their last night together . The phone rang . He leaned down and checked the caller ID screen this time . The call was coming from the Casa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierce thought about letting it ring through to the message service that came with the new phone number , but then he picked up the phone and clicked the talk button . " Look , man , I do n't know what the problem is . You have the wrong number . There is nobody here named- " The caller hung up without saying a word . Pierce reached over to his backpack and pulled out the yellow pad on which his assistant had written down the voice mail instructions . Monica Purl had set up the phone service for him , as he had been too busy in the lab all week preparing for the following week 's presentation . And because that was what personal assistants were for . He tried to read the notes in the dying light of the day . The sun had just slipped beneath the Pacific and he had no lamps yet for the new apartment 's living room . Most new places had sunken lights in the ceiling . Not this one . The apartments were newly renovated , with new kitchens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceilings without internal wiring could not be renovated in a cost- effective way . Pierce did n't think about that when he rented the place . The bottom line was he needed lamps . He quickly read through instructions on using the phone 's caller ID and caller directory features . He saw that Monica had set him up with something called the convenience package-caller ID , caller directory , call waiting , call forwarding , call everything . And she noted on the page that she had already sent the new number out to his A-level e-mail list . There were almost eighty people on this list . People who he would want to be able to reach him at any time , almost all of them business associates or business associates he also considered friends . Pierce pressed the talk button again and called the number Monica had listed for setting up and accessing his voice mail program . He then followed the instructions provided by an electronic voice for creating a pass code number . He decided on 92102-the day Nicole had told him that their three-year relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting . He would rather hide behind the disembodied electronic voice that announced the number and instructed the caller to leave a message . It was impersonal , but it was an impersonal world out there . He did n't have time to make everything personal . When he was finished setting up the program a new electronic voice told him he had nine messages . Pierce was surprised by the number-his phone had not been put into service until that morning-but immediately hopeful that maybe one was from Nicole . Maybe several . He suddenly envisioned himself returning all the furniture Monica had ordered for him online . He saw himself carrying the cardboard boxes of his clothes back inside the house on Amalfi Drive . But none of the messages were from Nicole . None of them were from Pierce 's associates or associates/friends , either . Only one was for him-a " welcome to the system " message delivered by the now familiar electronic voice . The next eight messages were all for Lilly , no last name mentioned . The same woman he had already fielded three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of them gave hotel names and numbers to call back . A few gave cell numbers or what they said was a private office line . A few mentioned getting her number off the net or the site , without being more specific . Pierce erased each message after listening to it . He then turned the page on his notebook and wrote down the name Lilly . He underlined it while he thought about things . Lilly-whoever she was-had apparently stopped using the number . It had been dropped back into circulation by the phone company and then reassigned to him . Judging by the all-male caller list , the number of calls from hotels and the tone of trepidation and anticipation in the voices he had listened to , Pierce guessed that Lilly might be a prostitute . Or an escort , if there was a difference . He felt a little trill of curiosity and intrigue go through him . Like he knew some secret he was n't supposed to know . Like when he called up the security cameras on his screen at work and surreptitiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of the office . He wondered how long the phone number would have been out of use before it was reassigned to him . The number of calls to the line in one day indicated that the phone number was still out there-probably on the website mentioned in a few of the messages-and people still believed it was Lilly 's valid number . " Wrong number , " he said out loud , though he rarely spoke to himself when he was n't looking at a computer screen or engaged in an experiment in the lab . He flipped the page back and looked at the information Monica had written down for him . She had included the phone company 's customer service number . He could and should call to get the number changed . He also knew it would be an annoying inconvenience to have to resend and receive e-mail notifications correcting the number . Something else made him hesitate about changing the number . He was intrigued . He admitted it to himself . Who was Lilly ? Where was she ? Why did she give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a flaw in the logic flow there , and maybe that was what gripped him . How did she maintain her business if the website delivered the wrong number to the client base ? The answer was that she did n't . She could n't . Something was wrong and Pierce wanted to know what and why . It was Friday evening . He decided to let things stand until Monday . He would call about changing the number then . Pierce got up from the couch and walked through the empty living room to the master bedroom , where the six cardboard boxes of his clothing were lined against one wall and a sleeping bag was unrolled alongside another . Before moving into the apartment and needing it , he had n't used the sleeping bag in almost three years-since a trip to Yosemite with Nicole . Back when he had time to do things , before the chase began , before his life became about only one thing . He went onto the balcony and stared out at the cold blue ocean . He was twelve floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to the ridge of the mountains sliding into the sea off Malibu to the north . The sun was gone but there were violent slashes of orange and purple still in the sky . This high up , the sea breeze was cold and bracing . He put his hands in the pockets of his pants . The fingers of his left hand closed around a coin and he brought it out . A dime . Another reminder of what his life had become . The neon lights on the Ferris wheel on the Santa Monica Pier were on and flashing a repetitive pattern . It made him remember a time two years earlier when the company had rented the pier 's entire amusement park for a private party celebrating the approval of the company 's first batch of patents on molecular memory architecture . No tickets , no lines , no getting off a ride if you were having fun . He and Nicole had stayed in one of the open yellow gondolas of the Ferris wheel for at least a half hour . It had been cold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd watched the sun go down . Now he could n't look at the pier or even a sunset without thinking about her . In acknowledging this about himself , he realized he had rented an apartment with views of the very things that would remind him of Nicole . There was a subliminal pathology there that he did n't want to explore . He put the dime on his thumbnail and flipped it into the air . He watched it disappear into the darkness . There was a park below , a strip of green between the building and the beach . He had already noticed that homeless people snuck in at night and slept in sleeping bags under the trees . Maybe one of them would find the fallen dime . The phone rang . He went back into the living room and saw the tiny LED screen glowing in the darkness . He picked up the phone and read the screen . The call was coming from the Century Plaza Hotel . He thought about it for two more rings and then answered without saying hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . A long moment of silence went by but Pierce knew someone was there . He could hear television sounds in the background . " Hello ? Is this call for Lilly ? " Finally a man 's voice answered . " Yes , is she there ? " " She 's not here at the moment . Can I ask how you got this number ? " " From the site . " " What site ? " The caller hung up . Pierce held the phone to his ear for a moment and then clicked it off . He walked across the room to return the phone to its cradle when it rang again . Pierce hit the talk button without looking at the caller ID display . " You 've got the wrong number , " he said . " Wait , Einstein , is that you ? " Pierce smiled . It was n't a wrong number . He recognized the voice of Cody Zeller , one of the A-list recipients of his new number . Zeller often called him Einstein , one of the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a business associate second . He was a computer security consultant who had designed numerous systems for Pierce over the years as his company grew and moved to larger and larger spaces . " Sorry , Code , " Pierce said . " I thought you were somebody else . This new number is getting a lot of calls for somebody else . " " New number , new place , does this mean you 're free , white and single again ? " " I guess so . " " Man , what happened with Nicki ? " " I do n't know . I do n't want to talk about it . " He knew talking about it with friends would add a permanency to the end of their relationship . " I 'll tell you what happened , " Zeller said . " Too much time in the lab and not enough between the sheets . I warned you about that , man . " Zeller laughed . He 'd always had a way of looking at a situation or set of facts and cutting away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly sympathetic to his plight . Zeller was unmarried and Pierce could never remember him in a long-term relationship . As far back as college he promised Pierce and their friends he would never practice monogamy in his lifetime . He also knew the woman in question . In his capacity as a security expert he also handled online backgrounding of employment applicants and investors for Pierce . In that role he worked closely at times with Nicole James , the company 's intelligence officer . Make that former intelligence officer . " Yeah , I know , " Pierce said , though he did n't want to talk about this with Zeller . " I should 've listened . " " Well , maybe this means you 'll be able to take your spoon out of retirement and meet me out at Zuma one of these mornings . " Zeller lived in Malibu and surfed every morning . It had been nearly ten years since Pierce had been a regular on the waves with him . In fact , he had not even taken his board with him when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the rafters in the garage . " I do n't know , Code . I 've still got the project , you know . I do n't think my time is going to change much just because she- " " That 's right , she was only your fiance , not the project . " " I do n't mean it like that . I just do n't think I'm- " " What about tonight ? I 'll come down . We 'll hit the town like the old days . Put on your black jeans , baby . " Zeller laughed in encouragement . Pierce did n't . There had never been old days like that . Pierce had never been a player . He was blue jeans , not black jeans . He 'd always preferred to spend the night in the lab looking into a scanning tunneling microscope than pursuing sex in a club with an engine fueled by alcohol . " I think I 'm going to pass , man . I 've got a lot of stuff to do and I need to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , you 've got to give the molecules a rest . One night out . Come on , it will straighten you out , shake up your own molecules for once . You can tell me all about what happened with you and Nicki , and I 'll pretend to feel sorry for you . I promise . " Zeller was the only one on the planet who called him Hank , a name Pierce hated . But Pierce was smart enough to know that telling Zeller to stop was out of the question , because it would prompt his friend to use the name at all times . " Call me next time , all right ? " Zeller reluctantly backed off and Pierce promised to keep the next weekend open for a night out . He made no promises about surfing . They hung up and Pierce put the phone in its cradle . He picked up his backpack and headed for the apartment door . ( Continues ... )                   @ @
