Chapter One It 's heartbreaking to think that your wife may not love you , and that night , after Jane had carried the perfume up to our bedroom , I sat on the couch for hours , wondering how this situation had come to pass . At first , I wanted to believe that Jane was simply reacting emotionally and that I was reading far more into the incident than it deserved . Yet the more I thought about it , the more I sensed not only her displeasure in an absentminded spouse , but the traces of an older melancholy-as if my lapse were simply the final blow in a long , long series of careless missteps . Had the marriage turned out to be a disappointment for Jane ? Though I did n't want to think so , her expression had answered otherwise , and I found myself wondering what that meant for us in the future . Was she questioning whether or not to stay with me ? Was she pleased with her decision to have married me in the first place ? These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers that were possibly even more frightening-for until that moment , I 'd always assumed that Jane was as content with me as I 'd always been with her . What , I wondered , had led us to feel so differently about each other ? I suppose I must begin by saying that many people would consider our lives fairly ordinary . Like many men , I had the obligation to support the family financially , and my life was largely centered around my career . For the past thirty years , I 've worked with the law firm of Ambry , Saxon and Tundle in New Bern , North Carolina , and my income-while not extravagant-was enough to place us firmly in the upper middle class . I enjoy golfing and gardening on the weekends , prefer classical music , and read the newspaper every morning . Though Jane was once an elementary school teacher , she spent the majority of our married life raising three children . She ran both the household and our social life , and her proudest possessions are the photo albums that she carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick home is complete with a picket fence and automatic sprinklers , we own two cars , and we are members of both the Rotary Club and the Chamber of Commerce . In the course of our married life , we 've saved for retirement , built a wooden swing set in the backyard that now sits unused , attended dozens of parent-teacher conferences , voted regularly , and contributed to the Episcopal church each and every Sunday . At fifty-six , I 'm three years older than my wife . Despite my feelings for Jane , I sometimes think we 're an unlikely pair to have spent a life together . We 're different in almost every way , and though opposites can and do attract , I 've always felt that I made the better choice on our wedding day . Jane is , after all , the kind of person I always wished to be . While I tend toward stoicism and logic , Jane is outgoing and kind , with a natural empathy that endears her to others . She laughs easily and has a wide circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that most of my friends are , in fact , the husbands of my wife 's friends , but I believe this is common for most married couples our age . Yet I 'm fortunate in that Jane has always seemed to choose our friends with me in mind , and I 'm appreciative that there 's always someone for me to visit with at a dinner party . Had she not come into my life , I sometimes think that I would have led the life of a monk . There 's more , too : I 'm charmed by the fact that Jane has always displayed her emotions with childlike ease . When she 's sad she cries ; when she 's happy she laughs ; and she enjoys nothing more than to be surprised with a wonderful gesture . In those moments , there 's an ageless innocence about her , and though a surprise by definition is unexpected , for Jane , the memories of a surprise can arouse the same excited feelings for years afterward . Sometimes when she 's daydreaming , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly begin speaking in giddy tones about something I 've long forgotten . This , I must say , has never ceased to amaze me . While Jane has been blessed with the most tender of hearts , in many ways she 's stronger than I am . Her values and beliefs , like those of most southern women , are grounded by God and family ; she views the world through a prism of black and white , right and wrong . For Jane , hard decisions are reached instinctively-and are almost always correct-while I , on the other hand , find myself weighing endless options and frequently second-guessing myself . And unlike me , my wife is seldom self-conscious . This lack of concern about other people 's perceptions requires a confidence that I 've always found elusive , and above all else , I envy this about her . I suppose that some of our differences stem from our respective upbringings . While Jane was raised in a small town with three siblings and parents who adored her , I was raised in a town house in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my parents were seldom home before seven o'clock in the evening . As a result , I spent much of my free time alone , and to this day , I 'm most comfortable in the privacy of my den . As I 've already mentioned , we have three children , and though I love them dearly , they are for the most part the products of my wife . She bore them and raised them , and they are most comfortable with her . While I sometimes regret that I did n't spend as much time with them as I should have , I 'm comforted by the thought that Jane more than made up for my absences . Our children , it seems , have turned out well despite me . They 're grown now and living on their own , but we consider ourselves fortunate that only one has moved out of state . Our two daughters still visit us frequently , and my wife is careful to have their favorite foods in the refrigerator in case they 're hungry , which they never seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane for hours . At twenty-seven , Anna is the oldest . With black hair and dark eyes , her looks reflected her saturnine personality growing up . She was a brooder who spent her teenage years locked in her room , listening to gloomy music and writing in a diary . She was a stranger to me back then ; days might pass before she would say a single word in my presence , and I was at a loss to understand what I might have done to provoke this . Everything I said seemed to elicit only sighs or shakes of her head , and if I asked if anything was bothering her , she would stare at me as if the question were incomprehensible . My wife seemed to find nothing unusual in this , dismissing it as a phase typical of young girls , but then again , Anna still talked to her . Sometimes I 'd pass by Anna 's room and hear Anna and Jane whispering to each other ; but if they heard me outside the door , the whispering would stop . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing , she 'd shrug and wave a hand mysteriously , as if their only goal were to keep me in the dark . Yet because she was my firstborn , Anna has always been my favorite . This is n't an admission I would make to anyone , but I think she knows it as well , and lately I 've come to believe that even in her silent years , she was fonder of me than I realized . I can still remember times when I 'd be perusing trusts or wills in my den , and she 'd slip through the door . She 'd pace around the room , scanning the bookshelves and reaching for various items , but if I addressed her , she 'd slip back out as quietly as she 'd come in . Over time , I learned not to say anything , and she 'd sometimes linger in the office for an hour , watching me as I scribbled on yellow legal tablets . If I glanced toward her , she 'd smile complicitly , enjoying this game of ours . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back then , but it 's ingrained in my memory as few images are . Currently , Anna is working for the Raleigh News and Observer , but I think she has dreams of becoming a novelist . In college she majored in creative writing , and the stories she wrote were as dark as her personality . I recall reading one in which a young girl becomes a prostitute to care for her sick father , a man who 'd once molested her . When I set the pages down , I wondered what I was supposed to make of such a thing . She is also madly in love . Anna , always careful and deliberate in her choices , was highly selective when it came to men , and thankfully Keith has always struck me as someone who treats her well . He intends to be an orthopedist and carries himself with a confidence that comes only to those who 've faced few setbacks in life . I learned through Jane that for their first date Keith took Anna kite flying on the beach near Fort Macon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , Keith came dressed in a sports coat , freshly showered and smelling faintly of cologne . As we shook hands , he held my gaze and impressed me by saying , " It 's a pleasure to meet you , Mr. Lewis . " Joseph , our second-born , is a year younger than Anna . He 's always called me " Pop , " though no one else in our family has ever used that term , and again , we have little in common . He 's taller and thinner than I , wears jeans to most social functions , and when he visits at Thanksgiving or Christmas , he eats only vegetables . While he was growing up , I thought him quiet , yet his reticence , like Anna 's , seemed directed at me in particular . Others often remarked on his sense of humor , though to be honest , I seldom saw it . Whenever we spent time together , I often felt as if he were trying to form an impression of me . Like Jane , he was empathetic even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , and they 've been nothing but nubs since he was five years old . Needless to say , when I suggested that he consider majoring in business or economics , he ignored my advice and chose sociology . He now works for a battered women 's shelter in New York City , though he tells us nothing more about his job . I know he wonders about the choices I 've made in my life , just as I wonder about his , yet despite our differences , it 's with Joseph that I have the conversations that I always wished to have with my children when I held them as infants . He is highly intelligent ; he received a near perfect score on his SATs , and his interests span the spectrum from the history of Middle Eastern dhimmitude to theoretical applications of fractal geometry . He is also honest- sometimes painfully so-and it goes without saying that these aspects of his personality leave me at a disadvantage when it comes to debating him . Though I sometimes grow frustrated at his stubbornness , it 's during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son . Leslie , the baby of our family , is currently studying biology and physiology at Wake Forest with the intention of becoming a veterinarian . Instead of coming home during the summers like most students , she takes additional classes with the intention of graduating early and spends her afternoons working at a place called Animal Farm . Of all our children , she is the most gregarious , and her laughter sounds the same as Jane 's . Like Anna , she liked to visit me in my den , though she was happiest when I gave her my full attention . As a youngster , she liked to sit in my lap and pull on my ears ; as she grew older , she liked to wander in and share funny jokes . My shelves are covered with the gifts she made me growing up : plaster casts of her hand-prints , drawings in crayon , a necklace made from macaroni . She was the easiest to love , the first in line for hugs or kisses from the grandparents , and she took great pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was not surprised when she was named the homecoming queen at her high school three years ago . She is kind as well . Everyone in her class was always invited to her birthday parties for fear of hurting someone 's feelings , and when she was nine , she once spent an afternoon walking from towel to towel at the beach because she 'd found a discarded watch in the surf and wanted to return it to its owner . Of all my children , she has always caused me the least worry , and when she comes to visit , I drop whatever I 'm doing to spend time with her . Her energy is infectious , and when we 're together , I wonder how it is I could have been so blessed . Now that they 've all moved out , our home has changed . Where music once blared , there is nothing but stillness ; while our pantry once shelved eight different types of sugared cereal , there is now a single brand that promises extra fiber . The furniture has n't changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the posters and bulletin boards have been taken down-as well as all other reminders of their personalities-there is nothing to differentiate one room from the next . But it was the emptiness of the house that seemed to dominate now ; while our home was perfect for a family of five , it suddenly struck me as a cavernous reminder of the way things ought to be . I remember hoping that this change in the household had something to do with the way Jane was feeling . Still , regardless of the reason , I could n't deny that we were drifting apart , and the more I thought about it , the more I noticed how wide the gap between us had become . We 'd started out as a couple and been changed into parents- something I had always viewed as normal and inevitable- but after twenty-nine years , it was as if we 'd become strangers again . Only habit seemed to be keeping us together . Our lives had little in common ; we rose at different hours , spent our days in different places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew little of her daily activities and admitted to keeping parts of mine secret as well . I could n't recall the last time Jane and I had talked about anything unexpected . Two weeks after the forgotten anniversary , however , Jane and I did just that . " Wilson , " she said , " we have to talk . " I looked up at her . A bottle of wine stood on the table between us , our meal nearly finished . " Yes ? " " I was thinking , " she said , " of heading up to New York to spend some time with Joseph . " " Wo n't he be here for the holidays ? " " That 's not for a couple of months . And since he did n't make it home this summer , I thought it might be nice to visit him for a change . " In the back of my mind , I noted that it might do us some good as a couple to get away for a few days . Perhaps that had even been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , I reached for my wineglass . " That 's a good idea , " I agreed . " We have n't been to New York since he first moved there . " Jane smiled briefly before lowering her gaze to her plate . " There 's something else , too . " " Yes ? " " Well , it 's just that you 're pretty busy at work , and I know how hard it is for you to get away . " " I think I can clear up my schedule for a few days , " I said , already mentally leafing through my work calendar . It would be tough , but I could do it . Continues ...
