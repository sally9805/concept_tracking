to step or to SPIN ? // Which health-club class burns more calories ? ... and more of your questions answered here . Q If my goal is to burn calories , should I take a one-hour step class or a one-hour Spinning class ? A " They can be equal , or either one can burn more than the other , depending on several factors , " says Dixie Stanforth , M.S. , faculty member in the kinesiology department at The University of Texas at Austin . With step aerobics , the higher the platform and the more you weigh , the more calories you 'll burn . The choreography also matters , although less than step height and weight . " You 're going to burn more calories with propulsive types of movements than with basic stepping , " Stanforth says . According to Stanforth , who has conducted research at various step heights , a 145-pound person doing basic stepping at a music speed of 120 beats per minute burns about 7 calories per minute on a 6-inch step , 8.5 calories per minute on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-inch step . Add tougher choreography , and the same person burns more calories per minute : 9.3 calories on a 6inch step , 10.3 calories on an 8-inch step and 11.1 calories on a 10-inch step . For one hour , the calorie expenditure typically ranges between 400 and 660 . Upper-body movements add little to the calorie burn , Stanforth says . Photograph In a 40- to 60-minute Spinning class you can burn 300-600 calories . // Only a handful of studies have looked at the energy cost of indoor cycling classes , she says , and they have found a calorie expenditure between 300 and 600 for classes lasting 40-60 minutes . With indoor cycling , your weight does not affect your calorie burn because in the seated position , you 're not bearing the weight of your body . Instead , the key factor is your power output , a combination of how fast you pedal and against how much resistance . Pedaling fast with little resistance burns minimal calories , Stanforth says , because " the bike is doing the work not you . " Pedaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to burn calories . You 'll maximize your calorie burn if you pedal at a faster cadence against a challenging resistance - a pace that is hard to define , varies greatly from person to person and depends in part on your fitness level . With step aerobics , the higher the platform and the more you weigh , the more calories you 'll burn . Many people think that , because they sweat so much in Spinning classes , they 're burning more calories than they are in other classes . But that 's generally not true , Stanforth says . The sweating is largely due to the lack of air movement in the room . " You tend to heat up a bit more unless there are fans , " she says . The bottom line : Since you can get a great workout in either a step or a Spinning class , choose whichever one you enjoy , or better yet , take both - on alternate days . Q My boyfriend is leaving soon for a six-month stint hiking the entire Appalachian Trail , from Georgia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join him for a month . How can I get in shape to hike 15 miles a day for four weeks straight ? I jog four miles four days a week and am daunted by this challenge . A Stick with your weekday jogs - aerobic fitness will serve you well on the climbs - but start adding weekend hikes , gradually building from 3 miles to 12 , suggests Hawk Metheny , a backcountry management specialist with the Appalachian Mountain Club , a Bostonbased nonprofit organization that maintains a section of the Appalachian Trail . To simulate trail conditions , try to hike both weekend days and carry a backpack , says Metheny , who has hiked the entire 2,167-mile trail . Photograph Building aerobic fitness through running will help you in other activities , like hiking . // In lieu of a couple of jogs per week , you may also want to wear your backpack while climbing stairs ( for the same amount of time that you 'd jog ) and eventually increase your pack weight to what you 'll carry on the trail . " That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to what it 's like to climb up and down , " Metheny says . The difficulty of hiking the Appalachian Trail is often underestimated , Metheny says , because the highest elevation is only 6,625 feet . " But the trail is a continuous series of undulations , and the tread way itself is very rocky and rooty , with short , steep climbs . " You may also want to make two of your weekday jogs as hilly as possible and gradually increase the other two to six-mile runs on flat-to-moderate terrain , says Courtenay Schurman , C.S.C.S. , coowner of Body Results , a Seattle-based company that specializes in outdoor fitness conditioning . In addition , Schurman recommends a total-body strength-training routine twice a week , including exercises such as dead lifts , squats and step-ups as well as core work for abs and lower back . " The strength training will help with stabilizing your knees and hips , " Schurman says . " A lot of people have problems when they add the weight of a pack . " Metheny recommends trying trekking poles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back problems by transferring some of the weight to your upper body . " Also , be sure to break in your hiking boots well before you hit the trail - and stop jogging about a week before your departure , Metheny suggests , so that you begin your adventure feeling rested . It takes a good two weeks to get used to hiking long distances daily , Metheny says , so remind your boyfriend that he 'll need to scale back his pace when you join him . Do n't be too daunted by the challenge , Metheny adds . " The physical aspect is just one component . Mental stamina and enthusiasm will take you a long way . " Q I 've heard that vertical jumps can help strengthen your hip bones , reducing your risk of osteoporosis . Does jumping on a mini-trampoline count , or does the softer surface hinder the benefits ? A " In terms of the evidence , we do n't know whether jumping on a minitrampoline works , " says Miriam Nelson , Ph.D. , associate professor of nutrition at Tufts University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Perigee Books , 2001 ) . " But I believe the trampoline most likely would absorb most of the shock and probably would n't have as big an impact on the hip or spine as jumping on a wooden floor . " Performing 50 jumps a day has been shown to increase bone density in the hips and spines of younger women , Nelson says . " But at the moment , I do n't recommend jumping for women who are middle-aged and older because it could cause injuries , such as knee and hip problems . " Q I 've been lifting weights at a gym for 10 years , but now circumstances have forced me to exercise at home . My heavy dumbbells work great for my upper body , but how can I get an equally intense lower-body workout with the equipment I have ? A You do face a tough challenge because the large lower-body muscles require significant amounts of weight . Try squatting while holding a single heavy dumbbell in front of you , using both hands . ( You can lift more total weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dumbbell in each hand . ) " Squat down to pick up one heavy dumbbell with both hands , extend up to a standing position , and then return the weight to the floor , " suggests fitness expert Dixie Stanforth , M.S. Try performing lunges with your rear leg elevated on a step , or do walking lunges with dumbbells . ( Instead of stepping backward after each lunge , step forward with your other foot and lunge your way across the room . ) Or do step-ups on a 14- to 16-inch-high step ( or sturdy , low coffee table ) . Place one foot on the step and step up to a fully extended position . Then slowly return to the floor . " Drive with the leg that 's on the step rather than pushing off with the other leg , " Stanforth says . You also can increase the intensity by super  --  setting . With each of these exercises , keep your abs contracted , shoulder blades back and down . 0 I lost 30 pounds by cutting calories and using the treadmill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was so happy with the results that I 've now added a short run in the evening . But I 've gained back 7 pounds , even though I 'm more active . What 's wrong ? A You 're exercising too much and probably not eating enough calories to fuel your workouts . When you skimp on calories , your body responds by slowing down your metabolism , which , in turn , can lead to weight gain . " It 's great that you 've made exercise a habit , but you 've taken it too far , " says Karen Freeman , M.S. , R.D. , a clinical instructor in the department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California , San Diego . Not only can excessive exercise slow your metabolism , it also can lead to overuse injuries , exhaustion and an increased risk of illness . Plus , if you do n't give your body time to recover between exercise sessions , you can lose fitness . You 'll reap more benefits if you cut back to one workout a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's also possible that your three-aday workouts are making you so hungry that you 're eating too much . To get to the root of your problem , consult a nutritionist who specializes in weight loss . Armed with more information about your eating and exercise habits , he or she will be able to get you back on track . Q When my period comes , I am just too tired to work , let alone exercise . Why does this happen , and what can I do to keep my energy level up ? A " The exact reasons for changes in energy level with menses are not known , " says Melissa Gilliam , M.D. , M.P.H. , assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Illinois at Chicago . If your symptoms start after day 14 of your cycle , it 's likely they are due to PMS . " Low energy is definitely recognized as a PMS symptom , but it 's not one of the more common ones , " Gilliam says . Recording your energy level throughout your menstrual cycle will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilliam says . " Anemia and depression should be ruled out . Sometimes people ascribe low energy to their menstrual cycle when , in fact , they are not related . " If your low energy is a symptom of PMS , Gilliam recommends getting more exercise , even though you currently feel too tired to work out . " It 's a little counterintuitive , " Gilliam says , " but if you 're active , you just feel better and have more energy , and you tend not to sink so low during PMS .
