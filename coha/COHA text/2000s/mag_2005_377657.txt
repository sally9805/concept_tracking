What 's the new way to cool down a hot car ? Law-enforcement officers across the U.S. are seeing a rash of so-called car clonings , in which the vehicle identification number ( VIN ) of an unsuspecting auto is duplicated on a stolen one . Miami police last month busted an $8 million cloning ring as part of an 18-month investigation that has so far expanded into seven other states and Canada and arrested dozens of suspects , including illegal-alien smugglers in Phoenix , Ariz. , and drug traffickers in Virginia Beach , Va . Says Florida attorney general Charlie Crist : " It 's a new method that makes stolen cars much harder to track . " <P> Thieves can clone any car by writing down its VIN  --  which is required by law to be displayed on the bottom of the dashboard and is also found on parts of the frame  --  and using bar-code software , high-quality home printers and metal-stamping tools to create identical tags for a stolen car of the same make and model . If a car has duplicated tags , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a routine traffic stop ca n't tell that it is hot . <P> Determining whether a car is a well-forged clone can take hours . " It is really an art , " says Dennie Huggins , field-operations chief for the National Insurance Crime Bureau , which has tracked cloned cars in all 50 states and reports that counterfeiters usually target high-status rides like the BMW X5 and General Motors ' Cadillac Escalade and Hummer . And since not all state vehicle databases are linked , thieves can retitle cars with the same VINs in multiple states without setting off alarm bells . All of which makes buying a used car an even dicier proposition .  --  By Brian Bennett
