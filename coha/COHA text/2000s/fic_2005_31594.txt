Keeper By Mal Peet Candlewick Mal Peet You probably do n't think this is remarkable . But if you knew the jungle , you would find it hard to believe me , because an open space in the jungle is not possible . Something , anything , will occupy any space where it can find light to live and grow . Yet here was this clearing , and it was covered in grass . Yes , grass . Short grass . Turf . Impossible . Absolutely impossible . I walked out onto this grass very slowly , far more alarmed by this clearing than by any plant or creature I had met in the jungle itself . . . . I was in a space that was about one hundred yards long and maybe half as wide , and I had walked out of the forest at a point about halfway down its length . I looked at first to my left and saw how the clearing ended in a dense , shadowy wall of trees . Then I looked to my right . And froze . Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goal . A soccer goal . Two uprights and a crossbar . With a net . A net fixed up like the old-fashioned ones , pulled back and tied to two poles behind the goal . My brain stood still in my head . I could hear the thumping of my blood . I must have looked like an idiot , my eyes mad and staring , my mouth hanging open . Eventually I found the nerve to take a few steps toward this goal , this quite impossible goal . The woodwork was a silvery gray , and the grain of the wood was open and rough . Weathered , like the timber of old boats left for years on the beach . It shoneslightly . The net had the same color , like cobwebs , and thin green plant tendrils grew up the two poles that supported it . It seemed to take an age , my whole life , to walk into that goalmouth . When I got there , I put out my hands and held the net . It was sound and strong , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , my fingers in the mesh of the net and my back to the clearing , trying , and failing , to make sense of all this . And then my fingers began to tremble , and then my legs , because I was suddenly certain that I was not alone . Continues ... by Mal Peet
