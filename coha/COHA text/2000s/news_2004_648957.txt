<p> Edgy Olympians in search of cautionary tales have no shortage of recent material . <p> There was Barcelona , Spain , in 1992 , when the American runner Michael Johnson was favored to win the 200 and 400 meters and failed to reach the final in either after being weakened by food poisoning . <p> There was Atlanta in 1996 , when the star British rower James Cracknell came down with tonsillitis on the day of the opening ceremony and was forced to withdraw . <p> There was Sydney , Australia , in 2000 , when Donovan Bailey , the Canadian sprinter , was unable to mount a credible defense of his 100-meter title because of a viral infection contracted in an Australian training camp . <p> World-class talent and the best-laid plans can end up as cold comfort if an athlete becomes ill before or during an Olympics . At the Games , a single event on a single summer afternoon is often the culmination of a life 's work . But what if someone ends up with the sniffles or worse that same day ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Professor Peter Fricker , the medical director of the Australian Olympic team in Athens . " It 's an absolute disaster to get a sore throat or come down with the flu on the eve of a competition . " <p> The risk of illness is compounded in an Olympic environment where thousands of competitors , coaches and out-of-shape journalists from every region and medical microclimate of the world are thrown together for a short time under stressful conditions in tightly packed buses , dining halls and news conference rooms . <p> As if injuries and the opposition were not enough to worry about , the Olympic environment is a large petri dish full of opportunity and danger . <p> " I remember in Nagano , we had 50 percent of our team come down with a cold , " Dr. Richard Budgett , chief medical officer for the British team , said in reference to the 1998 Winter Olympics in Japan . " Nine out of the 10 members of our bob team got a respiratory infection . It just went whizzing through the flat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a setting where four athletes typically share an apartment , most teams reserve a room in their Olympic Village quarters where they can isolate sick athletes or those who show signs that they might be falling ill . <p> " We 've had a few every Games who have had to be separated , " said Dr. Atsushi Masujima , the medical chief of the Japanese Olympic team . <p> As of Wednesday , the Japanese isolation room was vacant , but the Australian room had been put to use . Several members of the Australian women 's water polo team caught the flu before arriving in Athens , and some are still recovering . <p> " It 's not like all the athletes are all running around avoiding everyone else because they 're afraid of getting a cold , " Fricker said . " But you know that if someone on the team comes down with a cold or flu , they will get anxious and really want to see him moved away and put in isolation . " <p> In a sports world increasingly enamored of the technological edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive some of the same emphasis as sneaker and swimsuit design . The Australians , long at the forefront in sports science with their Institute of Sport in Canberra , have done extensive research on athletes ' immune systems . <p> " There 's no doubt that athletes are playing hard enough to suppress immune defenses , " Fricker said . " The normal population in Australia expects to get between three and four upper respiratory infections each year . But if you look at groups of elite athletes , about 15 percent of those athletes can have six or seven or more , up to even 11 or 12 . They seem to get more vulnerable as they train harder . Unfortunately , finding a strategy for these guys is not so easy . You 'd like to think there 's a magic table . " <p> For now , the only solution seems to be diminishing the training load . Fricker and his colleague at the institute , David Pyne , have devised a test that measures the salivary IgA , or immunoglobulin A , in athletes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicator of immune system vulnerability . The saliva test , which Fricker said is still being developed , has been used on an experimental basis with several Australian national teams , including swimmers , runners and rowers . <p> For now , much of the preventive medical advice doled out by team doctors in Athens sounds familiar to the non-Olympian , as well : Wash your hands frequently ; do not bite your fingernails or put your hands in your mouth ; do not share cups or towels ; drink lots of bottled water ; and avoid buffets and fish , particularly raw fish . <p> " We have n't gone as far as saying , ' Do n't shake hands with people , " ' said Budgett , a gold medalist in rowing in 1984 . <p> But some athletes are concerned about minimizing their exposure before the Summer or Winter Games . The Russian swimmer Aleksandr Popov once explained that he deliberately limited his contact with the public at Olympics . Some athletes , including the American pairs figure skater John Zimmerman , have worn surgical masks while traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that such masks only offer protective benefits for about 20 minutes . <p> The good news in Athens is that the Olympic Village is more spacious than usual . " I was in Atlanta , and it was pretty cramped , " Budgett said . " In Sydney , there was more space , but here is the least institutionalized environment of all the places I 've been . It 's much more like an ordinary village or town ; there 's a lot more air and room , so I 'm hopeful . " <p> The bad news is that , as in Atlanta , heat is a major health issue . Daytime temperatures have routinely been above 30 degrees Celsius ( 86 degrees Fahrenheit ) this week in central Athens . Although organizers have planned most of the endurance events and equestrian events for mornings and evenings , conditions will still be grueling . <p> " I think the pollution index is higher here than any of the previous places the Olympics have been held , " said Dr. David Weinstein , chief physician for the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the marble factory on one of the mountains here to reduce dust . So far the weather has been helpful , with the wind blowing the pollution out . The other key thing will be if they can keep a lot of automobiles out . " <p> Like other delegations , the Americans have tested borderline asthmatics in extreme conditions to see how they might respond to competing in Athens . " We 've had a couple of athletes test asthmatic who have not been diagnosed as such in the past , " Weinstein said . <p> Teams have come equipped with updated versions of the ice vests first used in Atlanta to reduce athletes ' core temperatures before and after events . When Canadian triathletes were training in high temperatures to prepare themselves for Athens , they reportedly swallowed pills that contained thermometers and transmitters so doctors could monitor their core temperatures . <p> In Athens , huge fans have been set up at the finish line of the equestrian events to cool the horses . <p> To monitor levels of dehydration , the French are testing their team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another device that measures an athletes ' water weight . " We experimented with that in Sydney and now it 's standard , " said Dr. Maurice Vrillac , the medical director of the French team . " But no matter what we do , it 's still going to be tough . " <p> At least the weather will be the same for everyone , but not everyone has to fight through illness to compete in the Olympics . Unlike Johnson , who swept the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Games , some of the sick will not get a second chance . " An Olympic dream can end just like that , " Fricker said . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
