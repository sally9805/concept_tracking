Photograph // Mike Jones and Kevins Dyson get together to replay and relive The Tackle-the most fantastic finish in Super Bowl history Shhh . Come on in and have4 a seat . Sorry the light is dim , but your eyes will adjust . See those two guys sitting in the front row ? The one on the left , his hair in braids is Kevin Dyson , the wide receiver for the Tennessee Titans . The other one , with the freshly shaved head , is Mike Jones , the St. Louis Rams ' linebacker . That 's right , the two players who gave us the most fantastic finish in Super Bowl history . They 're here , in this meeting room at Rams Park , to dissect and discuss the tie that will forever bind them-the final play in Super Bowl 34 . A play so momentous in its consequence , yet so fundamental in its execution that it is known by a simple appellation . The Tackle . That 's it frozen on the projection screen . Remember the situation ? Rams leading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rams ' 10-yard line ... six seconds left ... no timeouts . It 's mid-May , 31/ months since the Super Bowl , but this will be only the second time Dyson has watched the play . The first time was the day after the game , when the Titans returned to Nashville from Atlanta . Dyson secluded himself inside the office of receivers coach Steve Walters and looked for what-if anything-he could have done differently . He has a TV videotape of the Super Bowl , but the last six seconds might as well be blank . He simply has been unable to bring himself to watch them . When the Titans premiered their 1999 highlight film at their training facility and the final play of the game appeared on the screen , Dyson could n't bear to look . Sitting there in the dark , in the aisle leading up to the second tier of seats in the room , he lowered his head . But Dyson agreed to let THE SPORTING NEWS fly him to St. Louis to sit down with Jones and examine the play . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ity " Dyson says . " If it was just me , I probably would n't have really wanted to watch it " It seems as if everyone has wanted to watch the play with Jones . In the week after the Super Bowl , he went on a whirlwind trip to New York , where he appeared on Regis &; Kathie Lee ( " They were n't very personable " ) , Charlie Rose ( " He 's a great interviewer " ) and HBO 's Inside the NFL . One of Jones ' fondest offseason moments was when the University of Missouri , his alma mater , saluted him during its final home basketball game March 1 . He was invited to walk to center court and wave to the crowd , which gave him an ovation befitting a Super Bowl hero . " That was sweet I was able to get the monkey off my back , says Jones , a team captain in 1990 , when the Tigers lost to Colorado in the infamous " Fifth Down game .

Photograph THE INSIDE SLANT : Dyson ( left ) contends that if he had made a sharper cut before getting the ball , he might have been able to outrun Jones to the end mne. // suspense all too often , but Jones and Dyson collaborated to produce the ultimate climax January 30 in the Georgia Dome . Now they have convened to replay it-again and again and again . Six seconds of action . Sixty minutes of scrutiny . Let 's go to the tape . Tennessee , you 'll recall , had the ball for 13 minutes , 14 seconds in the fourth quarter and ran 32 plays to St. Louis ' 6 in that period . The Rams ' defense was exhausted . End Kevin Carter and tackle D'Marco Farr took themselves out of the game for one play with 28 seconds left , causing coach Dick Vermeil to clutch his head incredulously . When Dyson looked over to the Rams ' sideline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself . Dyson , who had only one reception for 9 yards in the game 's first 58 minutes , caught three passes for 32 yards on the Titans ' game-ending possession . On the next-to-last play , quarterback Steve McNair scrambled , incredibly escaped a sack attempt by Carter and Jay Williams-who dived at his feet simultaneously  --  and completed a 16-yard pass to Dyson . Rams cornerback Dexter McCleon stopped Dyson at the 10 and tried to hold him up , but Dyson smartly went down , and the Titans called their last timeout . As McNair came to the sideline , coach Jeff Fisher conferred with of fensive coordinator Les Steckel , who was up in the coaches ' booth . The Titans were in their " got ta win " series of plays , and Steckel called a mouthful : " Gun spear right open zag firm sliver right Detroit . " In simple terms , it was a shotgun formation with two receivers to each side . Dyson and tight end Frank Wycheck were to line up on the right side . " Open " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right tackle ; Dyson was to line up outside of Wycheck and slightly behind the line . " Sliver " called for Dyson to run a slant pattern and Wycheck to run a vertical route . The Rams went with a nickel defense and brought in a fresh pair of legs at right end . They replaced Grant Wistrom with linebacker Leonard Little , hoping to get a speed rush on McNair 's blindside . Jones , McCleon and safety Billy Jenkins positioned themselves on the Wycheck-Dyson side in a triangular alignment , each man representing a corner . Jones lined up at the 7 , inside of Wycheck ; McCleon straddled the 5 , on the outside of Dyson ; and Jenkins stood behind them at the 2 . " In the huddle , I do n't think anybody had any doubt in their mind that we were going to score , " Dyson says . " We had been doing that all year long-getting in close games and pulling them out . " Jones presses the play button on the remote switch , and the play comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking five steps toward the inside . Now he stops , pivots and comes back outside to his original spot . The Titans put Dyson in motion to keep him from getting jammed at the line and camouflage where he was going . As the ball is snapped , Wycheck runs straight up the seam toward the end zone . Jones turns to his left and drops back with him . " I 'm looking at you right now , " Dyson says to Jones . As soon as I saw you turn your hips and take Wycheck , that 's when I came . I thought you were following Wycheck and I could creep in there . " " Right , " says Jones . " I did n't think you saw me down there . I slid back with Wycheck because I did n't want him coming behind me , but I still had my vision on you . You might not think Pm looking at you , but Pm looking at you the whole time . " But this is much more complex than a game of peekaboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the key components for the Rams is the pre-snap communication among Jerkins , Jones and McCleon . Jenkins initially calls out " Trio ! " a 3-on-2 coverage , which means Jones is responsible for the first receiver , Wycheck or Dyson , who breaks inside ; McCleon is to take the first receiver who breaks outside , and Jenkins will back them up . When Jones turns his head to the left to relay the Trio call back to Jenkins , Dyson goes in motion inside . Jenkins moves across the field with Dyson , yelling , " Connie ! " Now the coverage has been changed . Jenkins and Jones will double-team Dyson Jenkins taking the inside , Jones the outside-and McCleon will go one-on-one with Wycheck . Jones turns and looks over his right shoulder to give that call back to Jenkins . Just when he does that , Dyson reverses his field and goes back outside . " If you guys had snapped the ball right there , we 're in big trouble , Jones says . " We were kind of in a Catch-22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot , Jenkins yells , " Trio ! " again . Three coverage calls and the ball has n't even been snapped . As Wycheck goes upfield , Dyson moves into the area vacated by the end swinging just slightly to the outside . At the 7 , he slants inside . He does n't make a sharp cut ; the break is more like a vrescent pattern This catches Dyson 's attention as he watches the film . " Looking at this again , if I had come flatter , I might have been able to outrun you to the end zone , " he tells Jones . " Nobody else is going to make this play but you . So maybe if I had come flat more around the 5-yard line and tried to outrun you ... . " As he breaks inside at the 7 , Dyson turns his head back and looks for McNair 's pass . He snares it just as he crosses the 5 . " It was a perfect ball-in the stomach , low , in front of me , " Dyson says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with his left arm . He is yelling , " In ! In ! In ! " to Jones , who already knows the pass is coming to Dyson . He drops off Wycheck . " I could see your eyes getting bigger , " Jones tells Dyson . " You can tell when a receiver is about to get a ball . They 've got to look back , turn their head then they 've got to get their hands ready to catch the ball . " Unless he is taking a receiver oneon-one , Jones says , he is supposed to stay out of the end zone in coverage . The goal line is his boundary line . Jones follows Wycheck to the 3 , then passes him off to Jenkins , who is in the end zone . " If Wycheck had taken me just a little bit wider , then you and I would have had a footrace , " Jones says . " Because you would have had more space to run , and I would have had more space to cover . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops , turns his hips back inside and gives chase . No other Rams player is in position to stop Dyson from getting to the end zone . All that hangs in the balance is the outcome of the Super Bowl . Pease the tape for a moment Let 's find out more about Dyson and Jones , and how they reached this crucial football intersection . Dyson , 25 , a record-setting receiver at the University of Utah , was the 16th player selected in the 1998 draf-the only receiver taken ahead of Randy Moss . The Titans , like many of their NFL brethren , believed Moss ' off field problems made him too much of a risk . They liked the 6-1 Dyson 's size/speed combination ; their 40-yard dash time on Dyson ( 4.39 ) was actually two-hundredths of a second faster than they had on Moss . Photograph Photograph Photograph Photograph Photograph // Aft a mediocre rookie season in which he caught 21 passes for 263 yards and two touchdowns , Dyson was the Titans ' second-leading receiver ( behind Wycheck ) last season , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was as a special teams fill-in that he reached an apotheosis for the franchise formerly known as the Houston Oilers . Dyson was n't even supposed to be on the field when the Titans ' kick-return team lined up with only 16 seconds left and Tennessee trailing Buffalo , 16-15 , in a wild-card playoff game last January 8 . But two other members of the return team were injured , so Dyson was drafted . Lorenzo Neal fielded the kick and pitched the ball back to Wycheck , who threw a cross-field lateral ( it was dangerously close to an illegal forward pass ) to Dyson . The Titans call the play " Home Run Throwback . " Seventy-five yards later , Dyson was in the end zone , his touchdown forever to be known as the " Music City Miracle . " " It was probably the greatest thing in my sports life , " Dyson says . Just 22 days later , he would experience the nadir . But Dyson has been classy in the wake of the final Super Bowl play . He even has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field , the ball in his outstretched arm , short of the goal line . Before training camp , he will fly to Mount Laurel , NJ. , to film a segment for NFL Films . It will be a spoof on the HBO series , The Sopranos , in which Dyson will seek a doctor 's help . " I go to see a psychiatrist because of this play . I ca n't reach the pepper , I ca n't reach my alarm clock ... I probably need to see one for real , " he says , laughing . " No , I 'm just kidding . I 'm fine . I really am fine . " Jones made an inconspicuous entrance into the NFL . He was not among the 334 players drafted in 1991 , when the selection process was 12 rounds . He played running back and fullback at Missouri , and his agent wanted him to sign a free-agent contract with the Broncos . But the Raiders signed him and switched him to linebacker at the urging of Mike Ward , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raiders sent out an evaluation form during Jones ' senior season , Ward filled it out-with a 11/2-page , handwritten letter to Raiders owner Al Davis as an addendum . Ward was convinced that Jones could play linebacker in the NFL . In fact , Ward and defensive coordinator Mike Church had lobbied to switch Jones to linebacker at Missouri , but head coach Bob Stull squelched the idea . " I knew he was n't going to get drafted as a running back in the NFL , " Ward recalls . " His speed was 4.6 to 4.7 . He ran a little bit upright , a little vertical for a running back , and that 's not good . He had average size . He did n't fit the mold of what they were looking for at fullback . What convinced me that he would be a linebacker in the NFL , and even in college , was his ability to open up his hips and run . A lot of guys are stiff ; this guy was smooth and fluid . And the way he could accelerate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go . And , then , cerebrally speaking , he was incredible . I knew he could read formations . I knew he could read tendencies . " Jones gradually ascended from special teams player to nickel linebacker to starter with the Raiders . He became a free agent after the ' ' 96 season , but some of the Rams ' coaches were reluctant to bring him to St. Louis because they needed a strongside linebacker who could cover the tight end and rush the passer . Jones had performed neither role with the Raiders . Through dedication on the practice field , in film study and in the weight room , Jones , 31 , developed into the player the Rams needed He became an iron man who was irreplaceable . He played in 1,045 of 1,047 defensive snaps in ' ' 97 and all 1,004 plays in ' ' 98 . Last season , he intercepted four passes ( returning two for touchdowns ) , recovered two fumbles ( one of which he turned into a TD ) , made one sack , defensed 13 passes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tackles . For the third consecutive year , he was voted by his teammates as winner of the Carl Ekern Spirit of the Game Award , named for a former Rams linebacker and given to the player who best exemplifies sportsmanship , work ethic and commitment to his teammates . " Mike is someone everyone should pattern their career around , " says Rams free safety Keith Lyle . " He works hard , he studies . He does all the necessary things to prepare himself for Sunday . " Jones , Carter and cornerback Todd Lyght usually play on the left side of the Rams ' defense , and they always have a rallying cry . During the Super Bowl , they decided that one of them had to make the big play of the game . In the second quarter , Carter sacked McNair for a 6-yard loss . Early in the third quarter , Lyght blocked a field-goal attempt Standing on the sideline before the final series of the game , Jones jokingly told Carter that it was his turn to make a play of magnitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And his ankle " was killing me . " A Titans lineman had accidentally stepped on Jones ' ankle midway through the fourth quarter . But Jones never left the field . And now came the final , pivotal moment As Dyson catches McNair 's pass , about 3 yards separate him and Jones , who closes the ! aap quickly . Dyson does n't even take two full strides before Jones lunges at him . Stretched out almost horizontally , his right foot off the ground , Jones reaches out with his right arm and grabs Dyson 's right leg , just below the hip . " When I reached out and grabbed you , " Jones says , " you 're going one way , and I 'm going another . I knew I got a good wrap on you initially with my right arm I by to bring my ( left ) arm around , and your momentum swings me all the way around . " In physical terms , it is much like a centripetal force : the force tending to pull a rotating object toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicist at St. Louis University who watched the Super Bowl and remembers the play , estimates it required the 202-pound Dyson to exert a force of nearly 300 pounds to swing the 240-pound Jones . When he is swung around , Jones clamps his left hand on Dyson 's left leg , just above the knee . It might just as well be a steel trap ; Dyson 's leg is snared , his forward progress stopped . As if that is n't enough , Jones falls on the back of the leg . " When you first hit me , I thought I could run through the arm , " Dyson says . " I 'm thinking , If I can get through this . .. : Then , all of a sudden , my feet stopped . " " You 're in if you can get that left leg up because you 're going to fall forward , " jones says . " That 's what I needed-one more step , " Dyson says . " I could n't get that left leg moving . " " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my hand on your leg , " Jones says . " I was at about the 3-yard line , and I knew you were n't 7 feet tall . " Dyson chuckles at this remark . As Dyson goes down , he rolls over on his left side and , while lying on his back , tries to stretch the ball across the goal line with his right arm . Too short Lyle comes over from the over side of the field and tries to knock the ball out of Dyson 's hand , but Dyson pulls it back . Dyson rolls over on his stomach , switches the ball to his left hand and stretches it across the goal line . Too late . His knee already has touched the ground . For a moment , there is an eerie silence on the field as players and coaches from both teams wait for a signal . Field judge Al Jury comes running in from the right side and points to the ground , indicating the ball was short of the goal line when Dyson 's knee went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miracle . A penalty flag ? A review of the play ? A malfunction in the clock ? In the last scene of the videotape , Dyson , still on his stomach , looks up at the clock . He watches it go from 0:01 to 0:00 . " I get up , and I do n't know where you went , " Jones says to Dyson . " I got hugged by ( tackle Jeff ) Zgonina , and the next thing I know there 's all this confetti coming down , and all these people are rushing on the field to get those platforms up for the trophy presentation . It was crazy . " " After the game , somebody said it was a perfect tackle , " Dyson says . " I said on a perfect tackle , you would have squared up and hit me so hard . " " It 's funny , " Jones says , " because the angle I make the tackle at ... if I try to run through you , you 'd probably ricochet off me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dyson says . " If you were n't there , I would have walked into the end zone . ... Even when I was going down , it seemed like that end zone was so close . " " It was , " says Jones , laughing . Dyson laughs , too . But with a bit less gusto . // Wrapping up The Tackle Author Affiliation Dennis Dillon is a senior writer for THE SPORTING NEWS . // <p>
