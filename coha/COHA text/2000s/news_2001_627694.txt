<p> SANDWICHED BETWEEN a billboard , a ballpark and a slew of parking lots , the Arthur B. Cohn house has watched for 100 years as its turn-of-the-century neighbors were decimated by new development . <p> Now , the Cohn House and the nearby Foley House - the only remnants of what was once a residential neighborhood of 500 houses - may be in danger themselves . The city is extending the Avenida de las Americas from the George R. Brown Convention Center to Enron Field , going right through the block the two houses sit on . <p> It is a familiar story in Houston , a city that has n't hesitated to throw out the old to make room for the new . Now , even as the city shows a fresh interest in its vintage buildings , a three-year attempt to strengthen the city 's historic preservation law is coming up far short in the eyes of preservationists . <p> The current law , widely considered one of the weakest in the nation , requires builders to get city approval to demolish or renovate historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builders simply have to wait 90 days before doing whatever they please . <p> Under the proposed changes , that would no longer be the case for exterior renovations . If the city rejected a proposal to change a historic building , the owner would not be able to proceed with the work . <p> But after a 180-day period , owners would still be entitled to knock down their buildings , with or without city approval . That rankles preservationists , who say it should not be easier to destroy a building than to restore it . <p> A City Council committee began grappling with the ordinance last week with the hope of taking it before the full council in the next couple of months . <p> Activists say the changes accomplish little or nothing and are evidence of the enormous influence developers enjoy at City Hall . <p> " If we 're going to say preservation and then wink at everybody and let the developers do what they want , why have an ordinance ? " asked Mike O'Brien , president of the Houston Homeowner 's Association . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door " zoning through preservation laws that unfairly limit property owners ' rights . <p> Houston is the only major city in the country that does not have a zoning law . <p> " Efforts like this can tend to be a slippery slope to total government control of historic buildings , " Councilman Rob Todd said . " We fought a revolution over this . If you 've got people who are spending their life savings on their property , they ought to be able to do whatever they want with their property . " <p> The Queen Anne-style Cohn House has city , state and national historic landmark designations , but none of those guarantee it will be saved from the wrecking ball . The house 's best chance for survival is relocation from the southeast downtown site where it has stood since 1905 . <p> The blue and white wood-frame house belonged to Arthur Cohn , William Marsh Rice 's accountant and an instrumental player in the founding of what is now Rice University . <p> The nearby Foley House , a neo-Classical wood-frame structure with Corinthian columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks from the site where it was built in 1904 . It was owned by William Lee Foley , who established W.L. Foley Dry Goods Co. , a predecessor to Foley 's Department Store . <p> City officials say they are trying to save both houses , perhaps evidence of Houston 's new appreciation for historic buildings . The city 's older neighborhoods , including downtown , the wards , Montrose and the Heights , are booming as suburbanites flock inside the Loop . <p> Many of Main Street 's buildings have been unmasked to show their original facades and neighborhoods are rallying to preserve their character . <p> But the urban revitalization also endangers old buildings as Victorian bungalows make way for townhouses and whole neighborhoods are knocked down for parking lots . <p> In the Old Sixth Ward , the first Houston neighborhood to be designated a historic district in 1978 , preservationists fear the influx of new buildings will cause the area to lose its historic status . The 25-square-block area just west of downtown was founded by railroad workers who built their modest wooden bungalows near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working class from which this city grew , " said Jane Cahill , a neighborhood activist . <p> Now an influx of large townhouses is putting the area in danger of dipping below the number of old buildings required to keep its historic designation . More than fifty percent of the buildings in a neighborhood must be more than 50 years old to warrant a designation . <p> " If we do n't get more protection , we 're going to be decimated , " Cahill said , adding that the proposed changes to the law are not enough . <p> Cary Wintz , who heads the Houston Archaeological and Historical Commission , played a major role in developing the proposal that is before council . He said while he personally agrees with the preservationists , he knew developer-friendly Houston would n't go for a tougher law . <p> " We tried to balance and do what was politically possible , " he said . <p> Preservationists argue that City Council will likely further weaken the historical commission 's proposal , so the panel should have asked for what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watered down position we 're never going to get anywhere , " said Ramona Davis , executive director of the Greater Houston Preservation Alliance . <p> Even Wintz admits that the 90-day demolition provision in the current ordinance " does n't protect much of anything except in terms of moral persuasion . " <p> So why is 180 days so much better ? <p> Wintz said the additional time will give preservationists a chance to try to change developers ' minds or buy the building and save it . And he pointed out that new development in a historic district will be subject to city approval , making it more difficult for developers to knock down one building and start over . <p> " It at least stops the bulldozers long enough for dialogue , " said Councilwoman Annise Parker , who heads the Neighborhood Protection and Quality of Life Committee that is considering the changes to the law . <p> But Councilman Bert Keller said the 180-day period places an unfair burden on developers , who incur costs for the property while they are waiting to use it as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone $ 30,000 a month ? " he asked . " People do n't like to be delayed six months . " <p> Developers and their sympathizers also worry that the city 's historical commission will get carried away , inflicting landmark and historic district status on property owners who do not want it . Currently , the city recognizes seven historic districts and 89 landmarks . None of the landmarks attained the status without the support of the building owners , and 67 percent of property owners in the relevant areas supported the creation of the historic districts . <p> Only once has the city attempted to grant historic status to a building over the objections of its owner . The city last year sought a declaration for the 62-year-old Jefferson Davis Hospital on Allen Parkway . Before the city acted , developer Marvy Finger demolished the 12-story hospital and sold the site to the Federal Reserve for $ 20 million . <p> Finger said it sat vacant for four years and no one cared . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55970 <p> The kids in Shani Broderick 's second-grade class at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . ' s life and times . But they 've grasped the vital lessons he taught : love , respect , equality . <p> For weeks last fall , they immersed themselves in the civil-rights drama of the 1960s , a period that in some cases preceded the birth of their parents . They read books ; they watched grainy videos of King 's immortal " I Have A Dream " speech of August 1963 . <p> Then they interpreted what it all meant to them . <p> The result : A colorful series of life-size multimedia self-portraits accompanied by inspirational poetry will be among prime attractions Monday when the Children 's Museum of Houston celebrates the civil-rights leader 's life with a full day of exhibits and activities . <p> Thousands of youngsters and their parents are expected for the Martin Luther King Jr .

It begins at 9 a.m . <p> Activities will include role-playing games , story hours and family motto collage sessions in which children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mayor Lee Brown will speak , and the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church Children 's Choir will perform at a morning commemorative session starting at 11:30 a.m . A second session , sponsored by the Kid 's Committee of the Children 's Museum and featuring a slide show and readings from King 's speeches , will begin at 1 p.m . <p> " Dr. King 's contributions to society were critical , " said museum spokeswoman Amy Gross . " He is someone the children might know . They recognize that he 's an important man , but who he was and why he 's important - that 's something that may be in question for them . Anything we can do to bring King to life for them , we should do . " <p> " You know the idea is to give folks , especially children , a linkage between the past and present , " said Coleman , a Houston Democrat . " We need to help them understand our world has come a long way . But if we forget where we were , we 're more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to educate the children of all colors and races as to the history of our country and why our country now is a better place to live in . " <p> Monday marks King 's 72nd birthday , and Gross said the museum will emphasize King 's humanity , his family and , of course , his dream of a just society with equality for all . <p> King , the son of an Atlanta Baptist minister , entered the civil-rights movement in the mid-1950s when he was asked by black community leaders in Montgomery , Ala. , to lead efforts to desegregate that city 's public transit system . From his position in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , King , strongly influenced by Gandhian nonviolence , grew in national stature from 1960 to 1965 . On Aug. 28 , 1963 , King delivered his stirring " I Have A Dream " speech to more than 200,000 civil-rights supporters gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D.C. <p> He was assassinated in Memphis , Tenn. , on April 4 , 1968 . <p> " We 'll have a biographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what his family was like when he was growing up , why he became a civil-rights leader , " Gross said . " We want the kids to understand this was a real person . He had a mom and dad , brothers and sisters , four children of his own . . . . <p> " We show them the positive things that Dr. King stood for . We say , ' Yes , it was scary . Sometimes it 's difficult to stand up for things you believe in , ' but we really do n't talk about the violence . They are n't ready to grasp that yet . " <p> Many of the ideas for Monday 's celebration came from members of the children 's committee , a group of two dozen pre-teens who advise museum administrators on exhibits ' content . <p> " I think our Martin Luther King celebration is a good thing for kids , " said committee member Brittney Hutto , 10 . " African-Americans and whites all are in the same culture in the United States , and it 's good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . We 're going to do a skit about that . Each of us will tell about what we believe . " <p> Another committee member , Rebecca Welbourn , noted that children will draw on elements of the black church experience to evoke the style of King . " We 're going to use call-and-response , " she said . " That 's where a person says something and the rest repeat it . That 's what Martin Luther King did to get people excited . " <p> Art exhibits will include photography collages on the themes of peace and cooperation , assembled by students at the Spring Branch Independent School District 's Buffalo Creek Elementary , and drawings by hundreds of Houston youngsters exploring " How I Keep His Dream Alive . " <p> The exhibits will remain on view through the end of February , which is Black History Month . <p> Broderick , the Oak Forest Elementary teacher , said her students began studying King 's life in October as part of a larger look at the significance of black leaders in American life . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of 19th-century black abolitionists Frederick Douglass , Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth . <p> In November , Broderick 's students prepared the art exhibit , which consists of life-size cutouts of the young artists adorned with yarn and multicolored paper scraps . Each drawing reflects the artist 's aspirations and is accompanied by an acrostic poem . <p> Daniel Bush , 7 , who drew himself as a bat-wielding baseball player , said he admired King because " he tried to change stuff . " <p> " He wanted people to have a better life , " he said . " He wanted to give people the same money for the same jobs . " <p> For the poems , Broderick said , the students chose words like " love " and " friendship " as their departure points . The first letter of each line combines to spell the chosen key word . <p> " Their poetry is very deep , " the museum 's Gross said . " We did n't quite know what to expect . They thought hard about it . They put together things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem , which dealt with " listen , " the young artist admonished his readers to " listen to teachers .

Right now , Morningstar offers the most accessible independent analysis to individual investors . <p> Morningstar is a Chicago-based company that researches and rates mutual fund companies . Its Web site at morningstar.com is one of the best inexpensive research tools average investors can use to choose mutual funds . <p> Other fund review companies , such as Lipper Inc. , do not share as much information on their sites and subscribing to their services is too expensive for most people . Much of Morningstar 's site is free . <p> However , novice investors can become confused when using the site . Morningstar provides explanations for a lot of the information listed but sometimes there is too much jargon in the definitions . <p> And the sheer volume of information can overwhelm . <p> Susan Dziubinski , director of Morningstar.com University , explains a typical fund analysis report and points out the most important elements for beginning investors . <p> She says there are five questions investors should ask when researching a fund . She stresses which features on the site offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a report from the home page . To start with , type in the name of the fund or ticker symbol in the Quicktake box on the left side of the screen . <p> If you do n't know the ticker symbol for the fund under consideration , call the fund or your 401(k) or 403(b) administrator to get it . You will need the exact ticker to verify that the report you 're reading is for the fund you want . Many funds have similar names or even the same name and are distinguished from each other by one word or one letter . <p> Now , here are the highlights of the guided Web tour , which uses Fidelity 's Magellan fund as an example : <p> 1 . How has the fund performed ? <p> At its most basic , performance means how much money you would have made or lost by investing in the fund . It is discussed in percentage points . A 20 percent return on your investment means you would have added $ 2,000 to an initial investment of $ 10,000 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graph with three lines that show the growth of an investment of $ 10,000 . <p> The red line represents the four-year performance of the fund you 're looking at . The orange shows how the fund and others that invest in the same types of securities did during the period . The green charts the performance of the securities index that best reflects the category . <p> In the case of the Magellan fund , the chart shows that in 2000 it did better than other funds in its category and its benchmark index . <p> By looking at performance in these contexts , you get a better sense of how well the fund is doing . <p> You also may notice that the category Morningstar places the fund in is different from how the fund company describes it . <p> In categorizing a fund , Morningstar looks at all of what it buys and how much of each security it owns . The fund company may use philosophy and investing strategies to name the fund , which may , in fact , be invested very differently from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they invest , not on how they categorize themselves , " Dziubinski says . " ( A name ) does n't mean anything because ultimately the fund can own anything . " <p> 2 . How risky has the fund been ? <p> Morningstar is known for its star ratings of funds , with five being the best possible score . But Dziubinski says the star ratings , which track past performance and are adjusted for the risk of not earning as much interest as Treasury bills , are not the most useful system for investors . <p> She stresses that the stars should not be the sole basis for investing in a fund . That 's because they rely on historical data and give no insight into how the fund will do in the future . <p> Instead , investors should look at the fund 's category rating . It 's symbolized by five numbered circles and a thick line arranged like a gas gauge . The category rating is found on the first page of the report . <p> The line points to the rating , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like the stars , this meter puts five at the best and one at the worst . <p> The category rating shows how well the fund has balanced risk-taking and moneymaking in the markets - risk and return . <p> It also is adjusted for the statistical probability of not doing as well as Treasury bills . T-bills are the benchmark because of their stability . <p> Dziubinski recommends that investors follow the link for Ratings and Risk in the green column on the left side of the report to look at the fund 's standard deviation . <p> Morningstar 's ratings systems look only at the downside or risk . The standard deviation shows both upside and downside measures . The higher the standard deviation , the more volatile a fund is . <p> Volatility relates to short-term performance and is one form of risk . Be careful not to look only for funds with a low standard deviation - that is , ones with a standard deviation of less than 5 percent . <p> " A lot of investors do n't endure enough volatility to meet their goals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some volatility . " <p> 3 . What does the fund own ? <p> Under this question on the report , you will see a nine-box grid . This is Morningstar 's style box , a snapshot of what kind of securities the fund owns . <p> It is merely a descriptive tool that 's designed to help investors decode a fund 's holdings . Do n't try to use it to buy nine funds to fit each box . That is not the way to build a portfolio . <p> Instead , dig deeper by going to Sector Weighting analysis , listed in the green column . There you will see in what industries the fund 's securities are concentrated . You need to know this to make sure your portfolio does not become overburdened with one industry , such as technology or energy . <p> Below that is a breakdown of the number of stock and bond holdings in the fund . That 's followed by the percentage of the fund 's assets in its 10 largest stakes . <p> A fund with 50 percent or more of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can experience more volatility than a fund with its assets spread out over more securities . <p> This does not mean that having more stock holdings is better than fewer . It just means you need to know more about the strategy behind the investment decisions . <p> 4 . Who runs it ? <p> " You can look at all the historical data you want , but if your fund manager has been running the fund for only two months , all that history means nothing , " Dziubinski says . <p> Back on the first page of the report , there is a paragraph headlined " Inside Scoop . " It gives a description of the fund and its management . Use the Management link in the green column to read a brief biography of the fund manager and to learn his or her start date . <p> To get a more detailed analysis of the team behind the fund , you will have to pay Morningstar . Or you can do the research yourself by calling the fund to learn the managers ' backgrounds or going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manager has left does n't mean you should decide against investing in a fund - or pull your money from the fund if you 've already invested . Take the time to learn about the new manager 's style , how it will affect the fund and if that will change your portfolio mix . <p> 5 . How much does it cost ? <p> The Fees and Expenses link in the green column offers you a total cost projection if you invest in the fund . It includes administrative and management fees , known as loads , and 12b-1 fees , which some funds charge to defray their advertising costs . <p> To help you get a handle on the fractions and percentages that funds use to discuss these fees , Morningstar breaks down in dollars what the projected cost of a $ 10,000 investment in the fund would have cost you over three , five and 10 years . <p> When assessing how well your investment has done , you need to take these costs and inflation into account . <p> The 20 percent return mentioned earlier may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of inflation . <p> By using Morningstar and other research to double-check the information you get from mutual funds and your employer , you can be more confident in your investment decisions . <p> By taking the time to learn a few of the analysis techniques money managers use , you can do a better job of managing your own portfolio . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55972 <p> HARLINGEN - His earliest memories are playing in the fields in his diapers , while his parents harvested crops nearby . <p> Geronimo M. Rodriguez Jr . remembers the day his family halted work as a " big kaboom " roared across the valley and watched in astonishment as Mount St. Helens exploded in the distance . He recalls the rainy day in a blueberry patch when a cousin noticed a snake coiled around her arm , and her screams as she tried to shake the serpent loose . <p> But the defining moment of his life , Rodriguez believes , was the day in 1981 when he and his four siblings told their parents they did n't want to stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Staying there would mean the Rodriguez kids would spend their school year taking classes in school districts in Oregon , Washington and Texas . <p> Instead , Rodriguez 's father stayed on while the children returned home to the Rio Grande Valley in time to start school . <p> The decision was critical for Rodriguez , 32 , a native of Alamo who went on to become a 1996 University of Texas law school graduate who worked for the White House . His most recent job was political director of Vice President Al Gore 's presidential campaign in Texas and nine other states . <p> Rodriguez said Texas ' migrant student program was key to his success . <p> " They were able to help by leveling the playing field . It was simple , " he recalled . When he headed north in the spring , " they sent my books from my hometown school ( in Texas ) with a note from the teacher saying , ' This is where we 're at , and this is what we expect him to do .

Others attend school full time in northern districts , helping their parents after school . <p> " The pattern is they arrive ( back in Texas ) in late October , early November , and then there are some who start leaving in April , " said Librado Hernandez , a migrant official at the Harlingen school district . " It makes it hard on them , real hard . " <p> This year , about 650 migrant students had not returned to Harlingen to enroll in classes by the end of September , he said . <p> " They ( migrant students ) have the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - of the mobility , " noted Gerardo Lopez , assistant professor of educational leadership at the University of Missouri in Columbia . " You 're moving from different school districts , and they may not have the same curriculum . There are all kinds of adjustments . " <p> The Texas Education Agency , which operates a migrant program funded with a yearly $ 43 million federal grant , identifies migrant students in each district . The districts are given money to hire migrant counselors , who take on the job of tracking down the students ' educational credits from other states - and sometimes Mexico - and try to help them complete their education . <p> Despite the millions spent , the best estimate by Texas educators is that barely half of all migrant students are able to get a high school diploma . <p> A number of strategies to improve their educational achievement are in use , including an Internet database to keep track of the students ' class credits , along with night classes , special tutors and video and self-paced computer classes . Some Texas districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing them to do school work via the Internet while on the road . <p> " The goal of this project is to coordinate the programs between the state and school district to increase the graduation rate of migrant students , " explained Tomas Yanez , TEA 's director of the Texas Migrant Interstate Program . <p> Yanez said that although California has more migrant students , most move to towns and labor camps within that state . Texas ' thousands of migrant students head out each spring to work all over the country , and some enroll in schools up north for as little as three weeks before moving on with their parents . <p> " We 're making headway , but there is a lot of work to be done , " Yanez acknowledged . " Way back before we had a migrant program - they started in 1966 - only about 10 percent of the students were graduating . <p> " At the present time the best estimate is that 50.7 percent graduate . " <p> TEA officials said the number of migrant students is steadily increasing because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Because of the emphasis on health consequences , they do n't want vegetables to have a lot of pesticides on them . For that reason , they need more labor in the fields , " said Patricia Meyertholen , a program director with TEA 's migrant division in Austin . <p> During the fall 1999 school year , 125,800 migrant students were identified in Texas schools , up a little more than 2 percent from the previous school year , which showed an increase of 5 percent from the 116,900 migrant students in fall 1997 , according to the TEA . <p> A major obstacle to gauging the academic progress of migrants was the dismantling in 1994 of a nationwide migrant student database by Congress for budgetary reasons , TEA officials said . <p> " Without a nationwide database , I do n't think there is any effective , accurate way of measuring it , " said Meyertholen . " I do know that overall , the migrant student population does not achieve to the state standard .

" Clearly , it 's not as effective as an electronic transfer , but that is another way we work to get the information there , and by phone and fax , " Meyertholen said . <p> Sanjuana Valtierra , 18 , a migrant student attending a Harlingen high school , is working hard in hopes of graduating this May .

But it was more of an idealistic war , because he hated Hitler so much and he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3rd Army when they liberated Buchenwald and Ohdruff concentration camps , and he saw firsthand the horrors of intolerance and racial hatred . <p> Smith movingly recounted his experience in a letter to his wife , Lucy , dated April 21 , 1945 : " I visited the concentration camps at Ohdruff and Buchenwald just after we had taken them and they are horrible . . . . " he wrote . " I got a young French man , who spoke English and had been there 13 months , to show me around . The stench was indescribable , it was complete with living skeletons , gallows , incinerators with partially burned corpses ; stacks of newly dead ( just skin and bones ) , and the most appallingly crowded conditions , " he wrote . <p> " . . . I can not understand how human beings can treat others so horribly . Europe is beautiful on the surface , but like a terribly diseased person , it is seething with sores and puss underneath . The world has certainly got into a terrible state . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concern for correcting injustices and helping victims of oppression everywhere . <p> " My father had two wars in his life that greatly influenced him , World War II and the war on poverty , " Kilgore said . <p> On his return to the United States , Smith went into banking . He started the industrial engineering department at Second National Bank , which became Bank of the Southwest in 1956 . <p> But banking never consumed his life . <p> " He had boundless curiosity , " Kilgore said . " He loved so many things , and he never did anything for recognition . He was president of the Alley Theatre board , and he helped saved Market Square in the beginning . " <p> Smith was also involved in the United Way and served as treasurer of the Museum of Fine Arts , Houston . <p> Personal tragedy struck in 1962 , when his wife of 30 years died suddenly . In 1977 , his daughter Susan Smith Blackburn died of cancer at age 42 , and in 1990 , his son , Cabanne Chenier Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " He felt terrible grief , " recalls longtime friend Charlie Perlitz . " He was absolutely devoted . . . and he found it almost impossible to proceed without them . " <p> But , of course , he did . He traveled : At 84 , he took a three-week bike ride in Russia . And he got involved in various causes . <p> " If you had his friendship in a project , it was a wonderful stabilizing factor , " Perlitz said . " You could turn to him , and he could see it without any emotional cloud or distraction . " <p> To honor Susan , a writer and actress who lived the last 15 years of her life in London , Smith and Kilgore established the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize in 1987 . A prestigious award given annually for outstanding plays in English written by women , winners have included Marsha Norman , Wendy Wasserstein and Paula Vogel . <p> In the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , Central American refugees had begun pouring into Houston , and Smith 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerry Kennedy Cuomo , in her book Speak Truth to Power , interviews human rights leaders and activists , and she speaks of the power of positive anger , " Kilgore said . " This is something that really came into play with my father 's feelings about our government 's involvement in Central America . " <p> . . . <p> In late 1989 , Casolo , then 28 , made international headlines . Salvadoran police raided her home and accused her of burying arms and ammunition for leftist guerillas in her back yard . <p> The straight-A student and cheerleader from Thomaston , Conn. , was a long way from home . <p> Born to a family that struggled financially , Casolo 's parents divorced when she was young . If it had n't been for her scholarship to Brandeis , she might not have gone to college . <p> " My father chose to leave our family when I was very young , " Casolo recalled . " He was n't present , and he was n't there to believe in me or give me encouragement . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dreaming . Her dream for me was that I be a secretary and get a good husband and all of that . " <p> That was never the life Casolo wanted . <p> She majored in American studies at Brandeis and became the first college graduate in her family . Casolo spent her junior year in Spain , where she was appalled by the wealth of the Catholic Church and the many impoverished people . Because of that it became her dream to work with the poor . <p> After graduation , Casolo took a job with the Brethren Volunteers , a pacifist group in There she met Salvadoran refugees and was moved by their stories . <p> During her 4 1/2 years in El Salvador , Casolo tried hard to be nonpartisan , though her sympathies were always with the poor and disenfranchised . It was a good opportunity , but not her ultimate dream of working directly with the poor . <p> ln fall 1989 , left-wing rebels launched an offensive in San Salvador , the capital . It was a desperate time and in the turmoil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed on Nov. 16 . Later investigations showed the murders were committed by El Salvador 's U.S.-backed military . <p> One of the priests was a close friend of Casolo 's . Many international church workers , journalists and other people were picked up by Salvadoran police . <p> They came to get Casolo on the night of Nov. 26 . She had just enough time to call the U.S. Embassy - a call she believes saved her life . <p> When Casolo asked to be allowed into her back yard , she was pushed into a chair . She said they found a few bullets and guns . A few days later , during a press conference , she was placed in front of a huge cache of arms . It looked as if she " had an arsenal , " she said . <p> " What I have always said is that I had rented the house six months earlier , and I ca n't prove it was n't a safe haven for the FMLN ( rebel group ) , " she said . " It was abandoned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is also the question of when the Salvadoran military came in and went out to my back yard , they would n't let me out there to see what they were doing . " <p> Her 18 days in jail with 48 other political prisoners were difficult but inspiring , she said . The women shared everything , from the cardboard they slept on to the food they ate . And they shared their stories . <p> When she was released and expelled from the country , the women gave her the strength to leave , she recalled . As tears streamed down her face , they said : " Courage , Jen . Do not forget us . " <p> She never has . <p> When she returned to the United States , Casolo was interviewed extensively and went on a six-week , 10-city tour . One stop was Houston . To her own surprise , Casolo was a dynamic speaker . <p> " I feel that for reasons beyond my control , I was launched into a place where I could talk about the hope and suffering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> . . . <p> After exchanging polite notes , Smith and Casolo remained in sporadic contact by letter . Smith knew it was Casolo 's dream to return to El Salvador . In 1992 , the FMLN rebels and the government of El Salvador signed a peace accord , ending a war that had killed 75,000 Salvadorans . She felt the time was finally right . <p> Casolo was considering joining Voices on the Border , a tiny nonprofit group that worked with Salvadoran refugees in Honduras . She suggested the group fund several model projects when the refugees returned to Salvador . <p> She sent solicitations to anyone who had donated after her speaking tour , explaining Voices on the Border . Smith sent another donation . <p> " I called to thank him , " she said . " I told him I was trying to get back to El Salvador and ( asked ) would he ever be interested in going . I believed people in the U.S. should see with their own eyes . " <p> Three days later , Smith called back : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only person who responded to her invitation . <p> " I noticed his voice was a little old , " she recalled . " I do n't know exactly when it was , but at the end of one of our conversations , I said : ' Do you mind my asking how old you are ? ' When he said 89 , I think I almost died . I thought to myself , ' Oh my gosh , if this man comes with me to El Salvador , he is going to die . ' " <p> Smith told her he had traveled extensively and had recently been to Russia and Nicaragua . Despite her qualms about Smith and about returning to El Salvador , she began planning their visit . But first Casolo made a quick trip back on her own , to make sure the situation was safe . <p> It was , and on her return , their plans were finalized . <p> The two met for the first time at the San Salvador airport . <p> " I remember he had on khaki pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little green in it , " she said . " He had white hair and was tall , about 6 feet , but a little stooped . Cab had this angelic smile when he was really happy . What I do n't know is if he had that smile at that moment . But he was probably nervous , too . " <p> What Casolo did n't know was that Smith was sick and had a fever . <p> Smith , Casolo says , liked to tell friends that he 'd been told to look for the shortest North American at the airport - Casolo stands about 5 feet tall in her stocking feet . <p> " I remember I would tell people that my father was going to Central America , and they said , ' What an unusual thing , ' " Kilgore recalled . " ' Well , I guess he will be OK if he just stays in San Salvador . ' But of course they hit the road immediately and went to the farthest reaches of El Salvador . He loved it . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a truck for them to travel in ; to save money , she stayed with friends . <p> After a tour of the capital , Casolo took Smith to a restaurant with a beautiful view of the city . It was near a deep gorge , Smith remembered in his video interview , where many military death squad executions occurred . <p> The restaurant was also the best place for pupusas ( Salvadoran tortillas filled with cheese ) . Smith ended up with a case of turista , and that 's how their trip began . <p> " I rented this used pickup truck , which did n't have a place for the spare tire , " Casolo recalled . " It was in the back of the pickup , and every time we got out , I had to lift the spare tire into the cab so it would n't get stolen . " <p> Smith was impressed with the way Casolo maneuvered over the bumpy roads heading toward the northern section of El Salvador . They stopped in San Miguel , then went on to Perquin , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Casolo described it as a simple town with a mural of Archbishop Romero , revered by El Salvador 's poor . <p> Smith also saw the Museum of the Revolution , with a big bomb crater ; around it grew the national flower of El Salvador , the flor del sorte . <p> " It 's a flower that will grow anywhere and is very stubborn , " Casolo said . " It was a good flower for Cab to see because , in a different way , he could be a very obstinate man . He had very firm beliefs . " <p> Despite his bad cold and stomach trouble , Smith was always eager for the next destination , Casolo said . <p> Perhaps his favorite place , she said , was the Segundo Montes Community . Named after one of the slain Jesuits , it was a new city set up by 7,500 Salvadoran refugees who had returned from Honduras after the peace accord . <p> It was a place where Voices on the Border had a strong presence . <p> " Every refugee was given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program set up by the United Nations as part of the peace accords . <p> " Adults were given $ 50 and children $ 20 . They decided to place half of it in a communal bank so each could get loans to build or improve homes and start small businesses . As a banker , Cab was very impressed with it and many other things about Segundo Montes . " <p> After their eight-day trip , Smith was passionately interested in improving life for Salvadorans . He had long opposed U.S. military intervention in Central America . Listening to Salvadorans ' stories reinforced that , Casolo said . <p> . . . <p> When Smith returned to Houston from his trip to El Salvador , he hosted a cocktail party so Casolo could update his friends on conditions in El Salvador . <p> Smith had always had friends of all ages , and so had Casolo . Smith believed that kind of contact helped keep him healthy and in touch with life . <p> The two had started to bond in Salvador , talking about many things , including religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agnostic , Casolo said , though he was spiritual . Casolo is deeply religious . <p> " He was an incredibly logical and rational man , with no room for hocus-pocus , " Casolo said . " I never tried to convert him , but he had lost so many loved ones . I wanted him to understand that as far as I was concerned , I had learned from the Salvadorans that those who die are carried on in us , at least as to the degree that we live out their ideals . I try to live that very much . " <p> Smith invited Casolo to his summer home in Point au Barques , Mich. , for a week . He knew Casolo had no money for leisure time or relaxation , Kilgore said . <p> It was there that they became true friends , talking about everything from politics to childhood memories . Every day they bicycled 20 miles as part of Smith 's exercise regimen . <p> " I wish I could find the words to express what bike rides with Cab were like , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under " the bluest of skies , " besides farming fields and keep up a " flow of conversation , telling each other our stories . . . listening to the joy in Cab 's voice as he planned a summer reunion of all his grandchildren . . . sharing stories of teen-age rebellions with Cab and his friends as if they were all of the same generation , " Casolo said . <p> Casolo has often wondered what made them friends . At first she knew Smith admired her , she said , and that made her slightly uncomfortable . She also felt she had little time for friendships . <p> " But I think I needed fathering , and I think Cab played that role , " she said . " It would hurt him if he thought that was all it was . He was also a role model for me of someone who survives hard times . And I had very few positive male role models in my life . He was definitely one and he was very supportive . " <p> Looking back , Casolo realizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed four boundaries - social , economic , age and gender . <p> After their Michigan trip , the two continued corresponding and exchanging phone calls . Each summer , Casolo was invited to Point au Barques . As Smith got older , Kilgore began asking Casolo to drive her father at least one way on the trip . <p> During that time , Casolo learned the Salvadoran government would not let her return . <p> Instead she moved to Honduras to work with women . She is currently a lay missionary in the Trujillo diocese in Colon , Honduras , working with the diocesan program for local development and social change . <p> Smith was sad about her move but supportive , and he immediately said he wanted to visit . He did , in 1995 , at the age of 91 . <p> " He was a little more tired , " she recalled . " I was living in a nicer house , but I still put Cab in a hotel , because I had no air-conditioning and there were lots of mosquitoes . " <p> Casolo took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Honduran women with whom she worked . <p> " The women thing was interesting , because unlike Salvador , which he could relate to because it was about U.S. policy , this was about women , " she said . " This was women 's rights , and so he had to think more about what women 's rights were when he was growing up . I was really amazed at his openness and willingness . " <p> The two continued to write letters , and Casolo visited Smith every summer in Michigan . But in 1997 , Smith had a heart attack , and he developed strokelike symptoms from the medication . The next two years , he focused on rehabilitation . Casolo visited him in the hospital and in a nursing home . <p> His mind was fine and lively to the end . Casolo lost her " great friend " to heart failure in May 1999 , at age 95 . She gave one of the eulogies at his funeral . <p> " When he died , I did n't know how to grieve , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told each of his grandchildren how much they had meant to him . " <p> . . . <p> Their friendship has reached beyond death . Over the years , Kilgore and Casolo also became friends , and they plan to continue their relationship in a number of ways . <p> One of them was a fall lecture by Casolo at the Rothko Chapel , in Smith 's honor . Entitled " A Place Set for Everyone : A Vision of Central America From Those on the Margins , " it was sponsored by the Houston Seminar , where Smith took numerous courses . Kilgore is on its board . <p> Casolo talked about her work and experiences in El Salvador and Honduras and about how moved Smith was during his visits there . <p> " I feel a sense of closing the circle , " Casolo said during her lecture . " I first met Cab by speaking , and here I am again with my mouth wide open . " <p> During his final illness , Smith had asked Kilgore to help Casolo continue her work , especially her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lecture , Casolo interviewed at a number of graduate schools , and she hopes to attend one possibly as soon as this fall . <p> But she will not cut her ties with Honduras , and she eventually plans to return . <p> " I 'm a doer rather than a thinker , so I hope it works , " Casolo said . " But I think it 's a little bit of Cab , and with the studies , it will be a whole lot more . So I know it 's a way of me being part of him and him being part of me . " <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55974 <p> The beginning and the end collided when Bubba shot the judge . <p> It was over in an instant , that brief explosion of violence that shattered the lunch hour of Oct. 29 , 1988 , in Emerald Bay , the posh little bedroom community on Lake Palestine near Tyler . <p> It began with a crash as the garage entrance to the William J. Amis home flew open and an irate David Hunter Brown stormed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging and strode down a hallway past a small office area . Without breaking step he began loudly demanding an audience with invalid oilman and millionaire Bill Amis Sr. <p> Almost immediately Brown was confronted by Amis ' legally blind son , Bill Amis Jr . Within seconds Brown was kicking and elbowing his way past the younger Amis . Within an instant Bill Amis Jr . had pulled a .38-caliber revolver from his pocket and fired four shots , leaving Brown critically wounded on the floor . <p> And then , it was done . <p> The gunshots were not heard outside the home , and the shooting went virtually unnoticed throughout the golf course community of Emerald Bay until police and an ambulance arrived . <p> For those involved , however - for Bill Amis Sr. and the son he called " Bubba , " for Amis Jr . ' s wife , Donna , and their daughter , Farrel , for Brown and his family - it was cataclysmic , the inevitable , volcanic eruption of an explosive mixture of personalities that had simmered for years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amis Jr . fired four slugs into David Hunter Brown . It was the critical turn in a story that had begun years before the first shot was fired . <p> That story has remained untold until now . <p> In effect , that moment marked the end of a bizarre period for the Amis family , a period in which Brown maintained iron-fisted control over the multimillion-dollar Amis trust , over Bill Amis Sr. and the entire Amis family . <p> Simultaneously , it began another , one that ultimately would bring death for both Brown and Amis Jr . It would lead to a strange trial that many believe was a travesty , a trial in which a jury , deprived of much of the history behind the shooting , convicted Bill Amis Jr . of murder . <p> It would open the door for a series of lawyers to decimate a fortune . It would leave Donna Amis a widow and 17-year-old Farrel Amis , a cystic fibrosis patient , at once penniless and an heiress to millions . <p> It was epochal , that moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed and injustice , cruelty and love . <p> It began with the birth of a wildcatter . No one knew it on May 18 , 1921 , but the son born that day to Victor and Oma Amis in Abilene would incorporate all the necessary characteristics of that singular breed . <p> William Joseph Amis would become a brilliant , hard-drinking , hell-raising , woman-chasing millionaire who was at once loved and hated , tolerated , venerated and eventually pitied by those whose lives he touched . <p> He grew up an only child , large for his age , athletic , precocious and talented . His parents separated when he was young , and he learned at the hand of his mother , a nurse who saved diligently so that her son could attend college . <p> The boy showed an aptitude for math and music , but an even greater one for attracting girls . At age 5 he found his first girlfriend , Billie Dean Collier , a neighbor child of his own age whom he would eventually marry . <p> Like many others who passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgressions and remain loyal . From first grade through high school Amis dallied with dozens of girls , but he kept Billie Collier on a string . When he graduated , he left Abilene for Texas A &M; University with national honors in music as a clarinet player and the undying devotion of Billie Dean . <p> In college Amis impressed his classmates . His clarinet rang out flawlessly in the Aggie Band , and his appearance was striking , that of a robust , strapping youth of 6 feet 2 with broad shoulders , chiseled features and a ready smile . <p> " More than that , he was brilliant , " says Paul Graham , an Abilene rancher and trucking company owner who roomed near Amis in college . <p> " He was a great party man . He 'd stay out and drink beer and raise hell all week while the rest of us were studying . Then he 'd cram all night Thursday for the test on Friday and make an A while we were getting B 's and C 's . <p> " By Saturday he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally lived short lives enthusiastically . No man among Bill Amis ' ancestors had been known to live past 55 and they crowded as much as possible into those years . <p> He was no exception . On more than one Saturday night , other cadets watched as Amis , fueled by alcohol and his own natural exuberance , ran down the dormitory halls , leaping in the air and smashing out glass light fixtures with his naked fists . <p> He pursued women with equal enthusiasm . Graham and others remember one geology dig in South Texas along the Mexican border during which Amis disappeared for several days , only to be found in - and retrieved from - a brothel on the south side of the Rio Grande . <p> " Billie wrote him all the time , but he rarely answered her , " says Graham . " He had this macho thing about him and he just did n't do that . <p> " But she seemed to love him anyway . " <p> Amis graduated from A &M; in 1943 with a B.S. degree in geology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II was raging , and he entered an armored unit , then transferred to the Army Air Corps . He served as a bombardier in a B-17 Flying Fortress , flew more than 30 missions over Europe and received eight medals , including the Flying Cross . <p> In 1945 he returned to Abilene a hero and married Billie Dean . He then turned to his one , consistent love and began drilling oil wells for Shell Oil in Oklahoma and North Texas . <p> " Bill Amis was made for the oil business , " says Keith Mann . Mann worked with Amis for years at Shell and later , when Amis was an independent . During those years he watched the repeated rise , fall and rebirth of Amis ' phoenixlike career . <p> " He was a born gambler , " says Mann . " He 'd gamble on anything , dice , cards or a well . He could lose and get back up and try again , and you had to be willing to do that . " <p> Amis was more reluctant toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage the young couple had one child , a girl who died three weeks after birth . Amis wanted no more children , but his wife prevailed and , in 1947 , William Joseph Amis Jr . was born . <p> Bill Amis , busy drilling oil wells , looked affectionately at his infant son and tagged him " Bubba , " that peculiarly Southern , enigmatic term of endearment . He then told his wife , " You raise him till he 's 15 . Then I 'll take him . " <p> By 1955 Amis had left Shell and moved to Dallas as an independent oil producer . As a wildcatter he was an indefatigable worker who spent long hours in his office and on the road . It provided a life of feast and famine , and , at one point , he moved his family to a small farmhouse while he sold their home to finance a well . <p> During this period he was an active philanderer as well , and he kept a series of mistresses who came and went in time to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of his weakness , but unable - or unwilling - to change it . " If you want to set a trap for me , " he told his friends , " bait it with a woman . <p> " You 'll catch me every time . " <p> Still , Amis showed genuine affection for his wife and son , and few of his paramours seemed to have any hold on him . Only one , that is : Paula Gatlin , Amis ' office manager and a woman with a penchant for diamond jewelry and poker games . She managed Amis ' business affairs , traveled with him through the oil fields of Texas and the gaming tables in Las Vegas and shared his bed for more than a decade . <p> " Paula could cuss like a man , drink like a man and outgamble most of the men I 've ever known , " says Ben Schleider , a Houston attorney and classmate of Amis who maintained a friendship with him throughout the years . <p> " She had an innate , uncanny ability with numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She also cared for him . <p> " There were n't any secrets about us , " says Gatlin . " Billie knew . She knew Bill was n't going to change , and I considered her one of my best friends . <p> " I was n't the only one and I knew that . Eventually , he did the same thing to me that he did to Billie . <p> " I guess I knew he would . <p> " Knowing that , you might wonder why I stayed with Bill Amis as long as I did . <p> " I loved him . He was fun to be around and he had charisma . He was the kind of man who could look at you and listen to you and make you feel like you were the only person in the entire world . <p> " Then , he could do something rotten to you and start the whole process again . " <p> He had a similar effect on his son . Bill Amis Jr . spent most of his life seeking his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as large as his father , and athletic , though not as graceful . At the age of 14 , however , just at the cusp of the promised date at which his father would assume an interest in him , something appeared to be wrong with young Bill Amis . <p> It became apparent as he played on the defensive line of his junior high school football team . <p> He kept tackling the wrong people . <p> Doctors soon determined that the boy suffered from a rare , degenerative eye condition known at the time as choreoretinitis . His peripheral vision was intact , but objects directly in front of him fell into a blind spot and appeared blurred or not visible at all . The condition was inoperable and progressive . The blind spot would widen and he would lose more of his sight as he grew older . <p> It chilled his relationship with his father . " It was almost as if he were flawed , " says Mann . " Bill Sr. never really accepted him . " <p> " His mother raised him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Sr. did n't love him . In his way , he did . He spoiled him , protected him , gave him everything , but would never treat him like a man . It was sad . " <p> Bill Amis Jr . shared some traits with his father . He was intelligent , jovial , optimistic and liked by almost all he met . Where the father was driven , however , the son was complacent . Where Bill Amis Sr. was wily and adept in a business deal , his son was irresponsible . <p> He could afford to be . His father 's producing wells had far outnumbered the dry holes , and the Amis family was secure . <p> Then , in 1973 , Bill Amis Sr. began drilling a series of wells in Grayson County on what would become known as the Philpick Field . The Philpick was a wildcatter 's dream , a field of about 260 acres that eventually hosted 14 producing wells . Within a year it made Bill Amis Sr. a rich man . <p> " At one point that field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Gatlin . " That 's not counting other fields . Bill was rolling in money for a while and he was spending it . " <p> His business also was expanding . By the mid-1970s Amis had offices in Dallas , Colorado and Alaska . Eventually he would own homes in Arizona , Grayson County , Dallas and Tyler . <p> Years before , he had bought a small ranch of about 300 acres near Lindale , in northern Smith County . He named it Tres Vegas and began landscaping portions of the property and building another home there . <p> Billie Amis moved from Dallas and made the ranch her permanent residence , though her husband spent far less time there . <p> " I think it was a place to park her while he did what he pleased , " says Mann . <p> He took that pleasure in Las Vegas and New Orleans , at Super Bowls and other events . They were rowdy affairs that resulted in more than one fistfight on Bourbon Street and an altercation in Miami that left Amis settling a lawsuit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though others were spontaneous vacations he and his friends might undertake on a whim . In either case , Amis did exactly as he pleased . <p> " I remember one time in Vegas , " says one acquaintance . " We were all shooting craps and Bill kept going off to go ' shopping . ' <p> " I finally asked Paula what was going on and she said , ' Oh , he 's got a second hotel room and he 's gone off with some whore . He thinks he 's fooling me , but I do n't care . ' " <p> At the same time , Bill Amis Jr . was coming of age . With his vision becoming rapidly more impaired , he made his way through three years at Texas Tech on innate ability and luck . <p> " The classes where the professors were really proud of themselves and tested on lectures I did all right in , " he would later say . " The ones where they tested on the book , I flunked . <p> " I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs , drank copious amounts of beer and attempted to match his father as a womanizer , failing at the last . He astounded others with his nonchalance toward his poor eyesight , however . <p> He refused to use a cane and never mentioned his lack of sight to others . Never totally blind , he memorized various routes and walked through traffic by adjusting his gait to that of whoever happened to be crossing beside him . He even continued to drive both a car and a motorcycle . He maintained his license by prevailing on a friend who closely resembled him to take his periodic tests in his stead . <p> " There was a story about him driving a motorcycle across Lubbock to some college party during a series of tornadoes , " says Berta Blalock , a former office manager for Bill Amis Sr. <p> " The things are blowing all around him , but he has his headphones on , playing music , so he ca n't hear them . He certainly ca n't see them , so he rides right through them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and apologized for not bringing any beer . He said he tried to buy some , but , for some reason , all the liquor stores were closed . " <p> The younger Amis left college before graduating . He worked briefly in Amis offices in Alaska , then ran a small leather business and had an office in his father 's suite in Colorado for two years . <p> For all practical purposes , however , the Amis oil business was run single-handedly by Bill Amis Sr. He and his son often sparred verbally over Bubba 's spending habits and the father 's control of the business , but Bill Amis Sr. always prevailed . <p> " Bubba really could n't do anything to run a business , " says Keith Mann . " He could n't see to read the books even if Bill had been willing to turn them over to him . <p> " And Bill did n't turn his business over to anyone . " <p> Least of all to his wife . Billie Amis suffered from a weak heart in middle age and retreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tres Vegas , where she watched the sunsets and gave pet names to the cattle and horses they had accumulated . <p> Then , in the early-morning hours of July 27 , 1977 , Billie Amis suffered a heart attack and died . She was found propped in her bed , her finger resting in a Bible , opened to Galatians and an underlined passage admonishing fathers and sons to honor one another . <p> Having never included Billie Dean Amis in his business when she was alive , Bill Amis saw no reason to do so at her death . She died without a will , and no probate filing was ever made . Amis simply continued to run his companies as he always had . <p> His son , however , had developed an interest of his own , one in which he might excel without intrusion or competition from his father . He had begun raising registered Santa Gertrudis cattle . He studied bloodlines and genetics and became something of an authority on in vitro fertilization . He purchased bulls and cows and developed his own strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won a series of prizes for superior conformation and Bill Amis Jr . even served a two-year term as president of the Premier Santa Gertrudis Association , where he impressed other members with his knowledge of the breed . <p> He became a regular at sales , where , in the wee hours before anyone else was present , he could be found wandering through the cattle pens , guided by a ranch hand . Periodically he would stop , climb into a pen and begin running his hands over the animals ' backs and legs , attempting to assess by feel what he was unable to determine by sight . <p> " He got kicked a few times and got his ribs broken once , " says Newman Copeland , a breeder who bought and sold cattle with Amis . <p> " It probably was n't the safest way to do it , but that way he knew what the cattle in various lots were like and he could bid the next day just like anybody else . He did n't want people to know he was blind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle business is one with a high overhead and slow returns . <p> " Bubba and his damn cows , " says Paula Gatlin . " You could n't make a dime out of them at what he was paying for them . I always thought they were a good excuse for him to dress up in a Western tuxedo and go to dances . <p> " Over the years he spent more than $ 2 million on those cattle . <p> " He and Bill Sr. used to fight over it . Bubba would come in the office . They 'd yell at each other for a while , then Bill Sr. would write him a check for a bull and they 'd shake hands and it would be done . " <p> Bill Amis Sr. always considered his son 's cattle operation a waste of time and money , no matter how many blue ribbons he might win . Rather than gaining his father 's respect , " Bubba " earned more disdain . <p> " Bill ( Jr. ) used to laugh about it and tell me his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing you are blind . You 'd cost me more money if you could see , ' " says Copeland . <p> " He treated it like a joke , but I did n't think it was a damn bit funny . " <p> As his son was raising cattle , Bill Amis Sr. was raising hell . In the early 1980s Gatlin estimated that Amis ' personal worth was around $ 8 million . He spent about $ 900,000 on gambling and " fun " over a five-year period . He wore a Rolex , drove a Mercedes with a gold grille and , like a number of other oilmen at the time , began house-hunting near Scottsdale , Ariz . <p> In 1984 he found one . Perched atop a mountain in Carefree ( a hamlet just north of Scottsdale ) , the 9,500-square-foot mansion is surrounded by seven acres of grounds . It boasts a majestic view , a man-made waterfall that cascades into a natural-stone swimming pool , sweeping verandas and lavish interiors . Amis spent thousands on artwork for the home and added his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too treacherous to truck in palm trees for the pool area , Amis had them flown in and lowered by helicopter . <p> The house cost $ 1.6 million , but Amis did n't balk . His credit was excellent and he simply borrowed $ 871,000 and bought it . <p> " He was enjoying himself and all that money , " says Berta Blalock . " It was about the time he was playing games with people . He always read spy novels , ' 007 ' stuff , and he would tell people he was in the CIA and have them believing it . " <p> Amis turned 62 in 1983 , and , if anything , the event seemed to increase his amorous bent . He soon found a new object of desire . On a flight to Las Vegas Amis and Gatlin found themselves with separate tickets in coach and first class . She opted for coach and , in first class , Amis found himself seated by a striking young woman . <p> Gina Zesatti , a divorcee of 27 with five children , opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the flight the two exchanged phone numbers and discussed a visit to Cancun together . By the time the plane landed , he had a new girlfriend . <p> He also had a suggestion for Gatlin as they were leaving the airport : He wanted a menage a trois . <p> It was a request that would spell an end to their relationship . <p> " I 'd been through a lot with him , but I was n't doing that , " she says . " That night , after he got off the plane , we argued over it , then went to the Hilton and he got drunker than a dog and lost $ 25,000 on blackjack . I took him up to the room and poured him in bed and went back down and won $ 37,000 at poker . <p> " The next day I gave him his $ 25,000 back . <p> " I should n't have . " <p> Over the next three years , Amis would race down a hedonistic course of self-gratification and destruction . He began a tempestuous relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gatlin , who had quit the company and was leaving Amis , left him with a parting thought . <p> " If you need a mechanic for that , then she 's not doing much for you , " she told him , and left for New Jersey . <p> Amis was too busy to worry . Along with Zesatti , ensconced alternately in Dallas and Arizona , he was simultaneously keeping a 19-year-old mistress in Colorado . He bought the younger woman a Porsche and , at one point , was almost caught when Zesatti decided he had spent an inordinate amount of time in Denver . <p> " She ( Zesatti ) called him and wanted to know what was going on , " says Mann . " He told her he 'd had a heart attack and was in the hospital and she said she was heading up there . <p> " Bill rushed down to the hospital and was sitting there , waiting in the lobby when she arrived . When she walked in he just got up and said he 'd been released and they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amounts of cocaine , despite a history of high blood pressure and a weak heart . It was a drug he had flirted with in the 1970s , but his usage increased a decade later . Bill Amis Jr . once found what he described as a " shoebox " full of cocaine in the Arizona mansion and flushed it down the toilet . <p> " He would mix up all his pills , too , " says Blalock . " He was taking about five different kinds of pills for various things several times a day and he would just dump them in a plastic bag and grab a handful every now and then and swallow them . " <p> And , as Bill Amis Sr. was chasing his fleeting youth , his son was becoming more settled . A blind date with Donna Renfro in Tyler in 1980 led to courtship . The two were married in 1981 and moved onto the ranch in Lindale . <p> " It was almost like a role reversal , " says Donna Amis . " The wilder my father-in-law became , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amis was born in 1983 , an alert , attractive child . Her parents soon learned , however , that she suffered from cystic fibrosis , the inherited disorder of the exocrine glands that restricts activity and limits the life span . <p> Donna Amis swore that she would do everything in her power for her daughter and embarked on a regimen of special foods and medicine . Drugs to combat CF are expensive and the cost of the child 's medicines averaged $ 35,000 per year . <p> " With CF you do n't just have a $ 1 ice cream cone , " says Donna Amis . " You have the cone and $ 3 worth of pills to offset the effects . " <p> Both her father and grandfather doted on the child and Bill Amis Jr . nicknamed her " Urchin . " <p> Bill Amis Sr. would soon begin contemplating marriage as well . Gina Zesatti had outlasted her counterpart in Denver , and Amis had purchased a house in Dallas for her and her children . Then , on Dec. 6 , 1986 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a two-month honeymoon in South America and , on their return , Amis resumed his first love , the oil business . He was seeking a new well and , in late February 1987 , Amis and Keith Mann visited a potential well site in Oklahoma . <p> " I flew up to Dallas and met him , " says Mann . " Bill drove to Oklahoma and we looked it over and decided to drill it . I remember , he said he did n't feel well . When we got back , I headed back to Houston and he went to Tyler . <p> " That night he had his stroke . " <p> Leo Jurica , a neighbor , heard garbled cries for help and found Amis , disoriented and clinging to a small gazebo outside his home in Emerald Bay late that night . He was taken to a Tyler hospital , then transferred to Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas . There , on March 1 , 1987 , doctors determined he had suffered a heart attack and stroke . A blood clot was lodged near his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Within days he would undergo brain surgery to relieve pressure caused by the bleeding . He was left comatose and physicians doubted he would live . <p> And , as his friends and business associates gathered outside his room , John Voight , a partner in a number of Amis ventures , turned to Berta Blalock and told her something would have to be done . " We had these projects going and somebody had to have a power of attorney to keep things going , " she says . <p> Blalock returned to her office , trying to make a decision . Bill Amis Sr. had never trusted his son or anyone else with all his business affairs . Blalock thought of one name , " Brown , " a former judge in Sherman who had handled a few traffic tickets and contracts for Amis in years past . <p> She flipped through the card file , found the number for David Hunter Brown and dialed . <p> " I thought I was doing the right thing at the time , " she says . <p> " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him " the Judge . " <p> David Hunter Brown had not held that position for more than a decade when he walked into the hospital room of Bill Amis Sr. on March 11 , 1987 , yet he claimed the title . <p> He had the demeanor . At 5 feet 7 and 165 pounds he was a smallish , compact man , but his presence could fill a room . David Brown had weighed 95 pounds and suffered from poor eyesight when he graduated from high school , and he had soon learned to compensate with determination . By age 67 his lantern jaw , steady gaze and no-nonsense manner had been honed to the mantle of one who could take charge . <p> At that moment someone needed to . Bill Amis Sr. had barely recovered from a series of strokes and heart attacks and his left side was paralyzed . He had undergone brain surgery . He was suffering periodic seizures , a heart bypass was scheduled , and death loomed as a strong possibility . <p> The old wildcatter had rallied for the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Farrel Amis . Whatever indifference he might have shown others , the child was precious to him , and cystic fibrosis made her future tenuous at best . Faced with his own death , Amis wanted to make her financially secure . <p> He seemed able to understand when Brown produced a universal power of attorney for his signature . <p> " I want you to realize that , if you give me this instrument I can do as I choose with all of your property , including beat you out of it , " said Brown . <p> " I trust you , " said Amis . " I 'm not concerned about what you 'll do . " <p> Had he been more lucid , he might have been . He might have seen two sides to his old acquaintance . He might have recalled that Brown never gave up anything easily . He might have realized that the iron-willed David Brown , once in control of Amis ' wealth , would maintain that grasp until death . <p> Bill Amis Sr. had known Brown since the 1950s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land for Shell Oil . The two had maintained contact , and Brown had handled some small legal matters and written a will for Amis in 1983 , though few of Amis ' other friends had ever met Brown . <p> " David Brown was a Jekyll and Hyde , " says a longtime friend of Brown who requested anonymity . " There was a twist to David . " <p> On one hand he was the respected lawyer , one who had practiced in Sherman with his brother , Paul , for years before they were both appointed to separate benches : David as a state district judge in 1965 , filling the position of a judge who had died , and Paul as a U.S. district judge some years later . <p> He was a civic-minded citizen who served on the school board in Sherman , was president of the chamber of commerce and taught Sunday school each week in the Church of Christ . <p> He had been a champion of desegregation who helped usher it into Grayson County in the 1960s . It was then that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painless as possible for the town and arranged for Brown to enter a segregated restaurant with a black minister and sit down for lunch among them . <p> Later , he was instrumental in forcing the school administration to open the high school stadium dressing room to visiting black teams . <p> He was a perennial political candidate who ran for numerous city and county offices , for Texas attorney general ( unsuccessfully against Crawford Martin ) and once even attempted a fruitless race against legendary U.S. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn . <p> He was the father of five children and a man regarded by his wife , Barbara , as " one of the most extraordinary men I 've ever known . " <p> There was another side to David Brown , however , and it led to his resignation from the bench in 1975 under a cloud . A Texas attorney general 's opinion held that he had violated the canon of ethics , and the State Judicial Qualifications Commission recommended that Brown be removed from the bench . The Texas Supreme Court approved a censure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Those actions came after a group of attorneys filed a series of complaints against Brown . They accused him of blatantly abusing his power by bugging a conference room and violating a prisoner 's rights in an attempt to make him plead guilty . Brown was a martinet on the bench who routinely held people in contempt of court , they said , while neglecting his judicial duties to be a paid federal arbiter . In addition , his peers charged , he had manipulated an elderly , confused woman into lending him money , taking money from her estate that was intended for a crippled children 's fund and making himself a beneficiary in her will . <p> On the first charge , the court found that in June 1970 , Brown had instructed sheriff 's deputies to plant a recording device in the attorney-client conference room in the Grayson County Courthouse in an attempt to record the conversation of murder defendant Charles Easley and his attorney , Steve Davidchik . Brown later unsuccessfully attempted to coerce Easley to plead guilty against Davidchik 's advice . <p> Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for violating the judicial canon of ethics by making himself a beneficiary of the will he had written for Minnetta Kern while she was in a nursing home . <p> Kern had left money to several beneficiaries , including $ 10,000 to the Grayson County Easter Seal Society 's Fund for Crippled Children and a house to a cousin , Elizabeth Wright of Oklahoma . <p> " In the 1950s , David Brown had represented my cousin in settling the estate of her brother , " says Wright . " She was an unmarried , older woman . He gained her confidence and soon asked her to give him $ 10,000 . <p> " After that he began to ask her for loans and would give her promissory notes , for which he never repaid one cent until he was forced to when I sued him . " <p> Brown later wrote the will for the elderly Kern and included a paragraph forgiving himself all debt . Then , when Kern died in 1970 , he refused to disburse her property . Wright eventually sued . The Texas attorney general cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance to the beneficiaries and pay the Easter Seal Society himself . <p> Brown also was found to have billed the National Mediation Board and the National Railway Adjustment Board $ 20,000 for 206 days of arbitration work during 1969 . It was more than the $ 18,000 he was paid by the state as a full-time judge for the same year , a salary he received even though he was absent from the bench 42 days and was partially absent on 109 . <p> His limited time in court rushed procedures , his detractors claimed , and caused Brown to threaten or cite attorneys with contempt for any delay . In one case , he jailed Sherman attorney Jack Kennedy , his brother 's law partner , for refusing to go to trial when one of Kennedy 's witnesses was unavailable . <p> He had been sued by his neighbors for repeatedly flooding their homes by draining his swimming pool into their back yards , and he was roundly regarded as a tyrant who frequently jailed people for contempt of court for not showing him the deference he desired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Steve Davidchik , the former defense attorney whose conferences Brown attempted to record . <p> " It 's the only term I could think of , " says Davidchik , who later served as Grayson County district attorney . " He was a little man who abused people repeatedly . " <p> Easley , Davidchik 's former client , was a serial murderer whom Davidchik had been appointed to defend . Easley wanted to plead not guilty to a Grayson County killing and Brown wanted the case worked out as a plea . <p> " That was n't the only complaint against Brown by any means , though , " says Davidchik . " He had to resign . It was part of the deal worked out with the court . <p> " It was wrong and they should have officially removed him from the bench . " <p> Despite losing his court in 1975 , Brown never relinquished his title . He demanded that others call him " Judge , " and refused to acknowledge greetings by his first name on the street . <p> " Once a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On March 11 , 1987 , however , no one in Amis ' hospital room knew of Minnetta Kern or Steve Davidchik . <p> " David ( Brown ) was very reassuring at first and he told us he would take care of everything , " says Amis ' office manager Berta Blalock . <p> Amis no longer could . Though not classically senile or brain-damaged , he would never fully regain the superior mental or physical ability he had enjoyed for almost 67 years . <p> He was changed in other ways as well . Later that same day the Rev. W.A. Criswell , pastor of Dallas ' First Baptist Church and a leader of Southern Baptist fundamentalists , was visiting the hospital when he walked past Amis ' room and spoke to him . The two conversed and Amis emerged from the discussion with a desire to join Criswell 's congregation and be " saved . " The following day Edmund Poole , Criswell 's second in command , led salvation rites for Amis . <p> At the same time a new relationship was developing between Amis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had to be restrained when they struck . Bill Amis Jr . had moved into the hospital with him and , large and powerful enough to hold his father during those attacks , he kept him from injuring himself and prevented the necessity of tying the older man in bed . <p> As the weeks passed Bill Amis Sr. began to regard his son in a new light and remarked on how he was becoming dependent on him . <p> He was more dependent on David Brown , however . Brown was direct and decisive , and his first advice for Bill Amis Sr. was to divorce his new wife , Gina . <p> " She 's not Billie Dean ( Amis ' long-suffering first wife ) , " Brown told his new ward . " She can devour you financially and she will , and you need to get rid of her . " <p> Arbiters are not allowed to represent clients in court and Brown , who had continued in that field under a " retired " status , used his law partner , Don Hays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hays never met Bill or Gina Amis . Brown billed for both his time and Hays ' , however , and eventually charged $ 15,000 for a divorce that involved little or no community property . <p> During March and the first part of April 1987 , Amis underwent open-heart surgery and went in and out of a coma . His condition improved then , and , on April 27 , Brown drew up the " spendthrift " trust that would put David Brown in charge of the Amis estate and Bill Amis himself . <p> It was designated for Farrel Amis . That trust , an unconventional document that made Brown the trustee and the trust itself revocable only by Brown , put all the Amis holdings , including those of Bill Amis Jr. , under its authority . It was designed to continue for 15 years , or until the deaths of Bill Amis Sr. and Farrel Amis . <p> On its surface , it would provide financial security for Farrel Amis . In reality it would pay David Brown more than $ 100,000 over the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an arbiter . Moreover , with his universal power of attorney and position as executor of the estate , it could be a job for life . <p> It would become a scepter that Brown would wield over the Amis family for the next 18 months . <p> Brown took over the books of the Amis companies at a low point . Oil prices were down , production from the Philpick Field was slowing , and the Arizona mansion was costing more than $ 10,000 per month in upkeep and monthly interest of $ 6,624 on its $ 871,000 mortgage . The Amis estate had shrunk from $ 8 million to a little more than $ 3 million , and Brown decided to tighten the belt . <p> He started with Bill Amis Jr . The younger Amis was drawing about $ 120,000 per year from the oil companies and spending another $ 80,000 on his ranch . Brown considered the younger Amis ' poor sight an excuse for not being more productive and his cattle operation an expensive indulgence . <p> Brown wrote Amis Jr . several letters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like alcohol or drugs . " Those missives also rebuked the younger man for wasting his intelligence and talent , then admonished him not to talk to his father . <p> " I 'll make him toe the line , " Brown told Berta Blalock . <p> He began a month later . At that point , in June 1987 , Bill Amis Sr. had returned to his home in Emerald Bay . His son moved with him , and the pair , accompanied by Blalock , had just moved in when Brown arrived . <p> " Come in here , " he told Blalock , as he led the way into the living room . " I want you to witness this . " <p> Then , says Blalock , Brown began to show a face she had not seen before . <p> " He was stomping around the room , raising his voice louder and louder , " says Blalock . " He was frightening . He pointed his finger at Mr. Amis and said , ' You need me . ' " <p> " He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be in charge or you can take your advice from that stupid , blind son of a bitch over there . If you listen to him , I 'm gone . ' <p> " Then , he looked at Bill Jr . and said , ' And you . You get out of here . Pack up your bags and go home to your wife and child . You 're not needed here . ' <p> " Poor Mr. Amis kept sliding lower and lower in his chair while David was yelling . When David was gone , he just started sobbing and saying , ' What am I going to do ? ' <p> " Bubba restrained himself , but his blood pressure had jumped so high we had to take him to the doctor . <p> " It was my first look at the real David Brown . " <p> It would n't be the last . A month after the scene in Emerald Bay , Brown , accompanied by his wife , drove Amis ' Mercedes to Arizona and spent the weekend in the mansion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew back and had the invalid Amis taken there secretly by Blalock and her husband , keeping the move from Amis ' son . <p> Then , insult was added to injury when Dallas Cowboys tickets that were purchased each year through the oil company arrived . Brown demanded that Blalock send them to him . When Blalock told Brown that " Bubba plans to take Farrel to the game , " Brown told her : <p> " You send them to me . I 'm not going to waste good football tickets on that blind son of a bitch and a 4-year-old . " <p> The statement left Blalock cold and angered Linda Gentry , Blalock 's niece and a secretary for the oil companies . Blalock sent the tickets , she says , and said nothing else . Then , as relations among Brown and the Amis family and employes were simmering , Brown added fuel to the fire . <p> " As far as this trust is concerned , I am Bill Amis , " he told them . <p> That position applied to most of the decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be married or divorced , where he would live and how the $ 3 million-plus in the estate would be invested . He inserted himself into Amis Jr's. life , first criticizing Donna Amis for wasting time and money on special diets for Farrel 's cystic fibrosis , then critiquing her shopping habits . He advised her to divorce her husband and , finally , told her she could have no more children because the trust could not afford them . <p> Then , in August 1987 , he hired Joseph Patterson , 6 feet 3 and close to 300 pounds , as a " nurse " to care for Bill Amis Sr. in Arizona . <p> Patterson , said Brown , was powerful enough to lift Amis , whose large , weakened frame was difficult to move . Brown had the trust pay Patterson generously - $ 100 per day with all expenses , a furnished apartment and a car . <p> Patterson , who would not return calls from the Chronicle , in reality was no nurse , though only he and Brown knew that at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind and little experience with invalids other than serving as a " sitter " on one occasion prior to his employment by Brown . <p> In fact , Patterson did not even have a driver 's license , though he eagerly volunteered to drive Amis ' Mercedes and used the car on personal errands . <p> In reality , say Blalock and others , Patterson was Brown 's lieutenant and Amis ' keeper , one they would come to regard as an overpaid behemoth who reported solely to Brown and kept Amis ' friends , family and all except Brown away from the invalid . <p> Amis was afraid of Patterson . In November 1987 , he called from Arizona and spoke to a family friend in Texas . The two were discussing old times when the friend asked when Amis might come for a visit . <p> " He told me he could n't , " says the woman , who requested anonymity . " He said , ' I 've got this giant for a nurse and he wo n't let me out or let anybody see me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be calling you now if he knew it . ' " <p> " I thought he was exaggerating . " <p> Apparently , he was n't . Patterson routinely screened calls to Amis . He even attempted to block a call from Paula Gatlin , Amis ' former office manager and mistress , who refused to be intimidated . Gatlin threatened to " come down there and tear your head off " before Patterson reluctantly put Amis on the line . <p> In addition , other workers at the Arizona mansion reported that Patterson abused the incontinent Amis , bullying and yelling at him and often leaving him for hours in fouled clothing . <p> Once , said one worker , she found Amis lying in wet bedclothes , sobbing , " I 've wet myself again . Joseph said I could n't see my granddaughter anymore if I did . " <p> Those complaints were relayed to Brown , who billed the estate for the time he spent listening to them , then ignored them . <p> The most graphic came from Blalock . Bill Amis Sr. , the once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had called a number of people , apologizing for past transgressions , and said he regretted the manner in which he had lived his life . <p> And , he told Blalock , he was affronted when Patterson repeatedly brought prostitutes to the home and had them cavort naked in front of the old invalid for amusement . <p> " I thought that was horrible and I called David Brown , " says Blalock . " He said , ' Joe 's young and sometimes he needs a woman . For that matter , sometimes I need one . <p> " ' You forget about it . ' " <p> Thanksgiving arrived and passed with no contact between Bill Amis Sr. and his son 's family . Brown ruled out visits and refused to pay for plane tickets , saying the elder Amis needed no visitors . He made similar statements just prior to Christmas and visits were canceled then as well . <p> Brown also chose that time to oust Gina Amis from the home Bill Amis Sr. had purchased for her in Dallas . With her divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children evicted from the house on Christmas Eve . <p> He then sold the house for $ 100,000 and hid the money in an account in a Sherman bank that Amis Jr . knew nothing about . <p> The younger Amis was not idle , however . He had become aware of a legal wrinkle in his favor . Because his mother had died with no will , he was heir to her half of his father 's estate , roughly half of the trust Brown controlled . In January 1988 , Brown reluctantly acknowledged that half-interest , but would not relinquish it , contending that , even divorced , Gina Amis still posed a legal threat . He advised Amis Jr . to sue his father for his share . <p> " That 's something I could never do , " the younger Amis told him . <p> For most of that winter there was icy quiet between Carefree , Ariz. , and Lindale , Texas . Bill Amis Jr . was rarely sure where his father was . The elder Amis , at Brown 's direction , alternated among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patterson continued to bicker with Blalock , Gentry and other employees . At one point , both Blalock and Gentry would quit their jobs , only to be recruited back by Brown . <p> And in Sherman , Brown drew up a new will for the senior Amis , making himself the executor and excluding the junior Amis . <p> Brown also made a number of disastrous decisions . He initiated a " water flood " of the Philpick Field , a procedure that cut production in half . He sold stock that was stable and bought stock that fell . He failed to inspect the wells and tripled operating expenses . <p> The losses made Brown decide to sell the Arizona mansion . He chose a real estate agent he knew well and took him out to see the property . <p> " It was impressive and he wanted to list it for $ 2.3 million , " says the Realtor , who requested anonymity . " I thought we might get that and said I would list it . <p> " Then David dropped it on me that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . <p> " I told him I would n't do it . In the first place that money was mine , and in the second it was illegal . He eventually listed it with somebody else . " <p> Then , on June 2 , 1988 , Brown was visiting in Emerald Bay when Bill Amis Sr. begged to be baptized . Amis wanted the ceremony at Criswell 's First Baptist Church in Dallas , but Brown declined , saying that would be too much of an undertaking . He announced that as a member of the Church of Christ he was qualified and would administer the baptism himself . <p> Then , as Blalock , Amis Jr . and a few others looked on in dismay , Patterson and Brown led the frail Amis Sr. to the hot tub , where Brown immersed him . <p> " It was ridiculous and sad at the same time , " says Blalock . " Mr. Amis was thin from his illness , and his bathing suit kept falling down to his knees , embarrassing him . His skin was sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was wincing from the pain . " <p> The incident apparently grated on Amis Sr. Within a week he had decided to rid himself of the judge . On June 8 , 1988 , he signed a power of attorney over to his son in a videotaped session at the Tres Vegas ranch . <p> The pair talked for almost an hour and the senior Amis affirmed his faith in his son . The two clasped hands and Bill Jr . remarked , " Now , it 's going to be Amises taking care of Amises . " <p> Brown had other plans , however . Aware that Bill Amis Sr. was rapidly slipping away from him , he called on Paula Gatlin . Knowing that Gatlin still had influence over her former lover and boss , Brown asked her to convince Amis Sr. to distance himself from his son . <p> " He offered me a plane ticket and $ 10,000 to come down and talk to Bill Sr. if I could get Bill to stay with him ( Brown ) , " says Gatlin . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him at a country club and him bragging about all the money he had taken from old ladies . <p> " I made him call me back four times and I tape-recorded him . " <p> The persuasion effort having failed , Brown pursued a more desperate course . <p> On June 16 , Amis Sr. was told he was going for an outing . He was taken from the Emerald Bay home in Blalock 's car by Patterson , leaving his Mercedes behind to make it appear that he was at home . He was driven to a Ramada Inn in Tyler , where Brown had an adjoining room . <p> There , he was kept overnight , deprived of sleep and his medication . Addled , at Brown 's direction , he signed a new codicil to his will , believing he was placing all his holdings in his son 's hands . In fact , the document made Brown executor and reinstated the judge 's power . <p> " I 'm terribly sorry for my part in that now , " says Blalock . " David told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I went along with him . <p> " Mr. Amis just thought he was going to a hotel for the weekend . " <p> Within two weeks , Brown exercised his revived power and cut off all funds to Bill Amis Jr . <p> Amis Jr . countered . He first consulted family friend and lawyer Ben Schleider . Brown , says Schleider , appeared to be a tyrant who planned to make a career of the Amis trust and intended to maintain control over it at all costs . <p> Schleider advised the younger Amis to obtain a guardianship to supersede Brown 's power of attorney . Bill Amis Jr . immediately retained Tyler attorney J.W. Tyner to secure the guardianship . <p> Tyner had just filed for that power on Oct. 27 when Amis Jr . got a call from Blalock . She already regretted her participation in the previous abduction of Amis Sr. , she said , and described that incident to the junior Amis . <p> Worse , she said , another kidnapping appeared to be planned . She had been to the Emerald Bay home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of Amis Sr. 's medication had been removed from the bathroom . <p> That evening Amis Jr . called several security firms , attempting to hire a guard to accompany him to his father 's home . None wanted the job , and he asked his wife to drive him to Emerald Bay . Unknown to her , he took a snub-nosed .38-caliber revolver loaded with four bullets from his desk . <p> They arrived late , after midnight . The Mercedes was parked in the drive and the house appeared shuttered for the night . The younger Amis decided to spend the night a few houses away , at the home of family friend Pat Byrd , while Donna Amis returned home to spend the night with their daughter . The following morning he went to his father 's home to find his father , Patterson and Patterson 's son , Timothy , a younger and even larger version of Joseph Patterson . <p> Bill Amis Jr . left his revolver in a desk drawer in his father 's office , and he and the Pattersons took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later that afternoon , Tyner had the guardianship papers approved by a judge and delivered them to Bill Amis Jr . <p> Things were uneventful at the Emerald Bay home that night . The following morning Bill Amis Jr . arose and showered in a cabana beside the pool . He thought he heard the phone ring but picked it up and heard no one there . A few hours later he was sitting down to lunch with his father at the kitchen table when it rang again and Patterson answered and muttered something into the receiver . <p> " Who was that ? " asked the younger Amis . <p> " None of your business , " said Patterson . <p> The younger Amis , apprehensive , left the table and stepped down the hall to the office . The guard at the entrance to Emerald Bay always called to clear visitors , and he wondered if someone could be coming for his father . He had just retrieved the revolver when the door leading from the garage crashed open and David Brown burst in . <p> Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the living room where Bill Amis Sr. usually sat . The younger Amis stepped in behind him and said , " Hello , David . I 've got guardianship papers and I want you to get out of this house . <p> " You 've badgered us long enough . I 'm telling you to leave . " <p> " Where 's your dad ? " asked Brown . <p> " You 're not going to see him , " said Bill Amis Jr . <p> " Where are the papers ? " Brown replied . <p> Brown scanned the guardianship briefly as Bill Amis Jr . stepped into the kitchen doorway . Behind him , his father sat at the breakfast table , and the two Pattersons , sensing violence , huddled by the stove . <p> " You son of a bitch . I 'm going to see your dad , " shouted Brown . He threw the papers into Bill Amis Jr . ' s face and began striking out with his elbows , hitting the younger man in the face . As Amis leaned backward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot into Amis ' groin . <p> " All I could think of was , ' This goddamn nightmare is real , ' " Bill Amis Jr . would later recall . " ' It 's really happening . I 'm the only thing standing between this SOB and my dad . ' " <p> The younger Amis pulled the revolver from his hip pocket and fired . The first shot passed through Brown 's upper right arm and continued on through a wall and into an adjacent bathroom . The second went through his left arm and fragmented . A third struck his right thigh and exited . <p> And the fourth struck his left clavicle , tore through the flesh and lodged by his spine . <p> Brown staggered a few feet down the hall and collapsed in the small entryway for the front door . Bill Amis Jr . followed and continued toward the garage entrance , passing by the prostrate Brown without seeing him . <p> Brown 's driver , a Sherman fireman who had been waiting in the car , rushed in when he saw Amis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Brown as Amis asked , " My God , David . Where are you hit ? " <p> As the fireman used socks and rags to apply tourniquets to the bleeding Brown , Amis walked back to his father 's office . He dropped the gun back in the desk drawer , picked up the phone and dialed 911 . <p> " My name is Bill Amis , " he said . " I 've shot a judge who refused to obey a court order . I 'm out of bullets and nothing is happening . Everything is safe . <p> " Please send an ambulance as fast as you can . " <p> Then , he walked back to the kitchen and quietly sat down to wait beside his father . <p> The case confronting investigators at 107 Henry Road in Emerald Bay was something of a topsy-turvy doll . <p> Like those antique two-headed playthings , opposites joined at the waist , the victim and the complainant at the William J. Amis house kept trading places . <p> It was confusing at the outset . The first sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an older , well-groomed man with several bleeding gunshot wounds lying near the front door . He was conscious , voluble and identified himself as " David Brown , senior state district judge . " <p> Outside , cringing on a patio , two huge , frightened men identified themselves as Joseph Patterson and his son , Timothy . <p> At a small breakfast table at the rear of the kitchen , clad in pajamas , sat a large , gaunt man , slumped forward with his head hanging on his chest . He was Bill Amis Sr. , he said , and he looked up in disbelief and dismay . <p> " I thought the son of a bitch was my friend , and he was stealing me blind , " he said . " Bill was trying to save me . " <p> Seated nearby was Bill Amis Jr . He explained that he had shot Brown , indeed a retired judge and trustee of the Amis estate , when Brown forced his way into the home in an attempt to kidnap Bill Amis Sr. <p> As investigators were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . At Mother Francis Hospital in Tyler , just before physicians cut the interview short and rolled him away to X-ray , he told deputies , " The son is a money-grubbing spendthrift . <p> " I tried to force my way in to see my client . I did n't have to knock . " <p> The Pattersons ' initial statements agreed with that of Amis Jr. , that Brown had stormed into the home and attacked the younger Amis . No arrest was made and the younger Amis was left with the promise from Chief Deputy Johnny Beddingfield that there would be a full investigation . Deputy Melody McKay filed a report listing the offense as attempted kidnapping , Amis Jr . as " complainant " and David Brown as " actor . " <p> That would soon change . <p> Almost immediately , one witness would be dead . Bill Amis Sr. , whose 67 years had been a roller coaster of success and failure , pleasure and pain , spent his final days with his son . <p> " It was sad in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . " His dad finally accepted him there at the last and , for a little while , he was like a kid who 's never had dessert and all of a sudden has a plateful . " <p> It would last only a week . Bill Amis Sr. suffered his final heart attack Nov. 6 , 1988 , eight days after the shooting of David Brown . <p> His funeral was held later that week . Houston attorney Ben Schleider served as a pallbearer and , at a gathering in Emerald Bay afterward , he stepped through the crowd around Amis Jr . and took him aside . <p> " Bill , " said Schleider , " do you have a lawyer ? " <p> " Yes , " said Amis , in a matter-of-fact tone . <p> " Well , he 'd better be a good one , " cautioned Schleider . " This is East Texas and politics can get ugly . <p> " Son , you shot a judge . " <p> More than that , David Brown was the brother of U.S. District Judge Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in investigators ' reports and court documents surrounding the Amis case . <p> Amis ' lawyer , J.W. Tyner , was occupied with other matters , however . David Brown , partially paralyzed since the shooting , had filed suit against Amis Jr . for battery . Amis , in the meantime , had sued Brown for fraud , incompetence , negligence and outrageous conduct in his treatment of Amis Sr. and the trust . <p> The cases were butting heads and Tyner was taking depositions . <p> At the same time , Texas Ranger Steve Black and Smith County deputies were pursuing the case , and one of the first people they spoke with was Judge Paul Brown . <p> Paul Brown had traveled to Tyler , where he met with Black and Beddingfield . Brown was concerned , said Black , but did not pressure the Ranger to file any charges . <p> Over the ensuing weeks , however , the federal judge became more active . He stepped in for his brother . His name would appear repeatedly in Black 's notes . The judge arranged interviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and was kept abreast of Black 's investigation . <p> He hired the firm of well-known Dallas attorney Frank Branson to represent his brother in the civil suit , and Branson 's firm began building a criminal case as well . <p> And , on the morning of Dec. 6 , 1988 , Bill and Donna Amis were in the kitchen at the Tres Vegas ranch when the phone rang . Amis answered and spoke for a moment , then turned to his wife . <p> " I 've got to go turn myself in tomorrow , " he said . " ( Federal Judge ) Paul Brown is pushing the DA to take the case to the grand jury . <p> " It 'll be OK . " <p> It seemed so at first . As he expected , Amis was charged with attempted murder soon after he arrived at the Smith County Courthouse . He was allowed to post a relatively small $ 5,000 bond and returned home , still unconcerned . <p> The civil suit was becoming complicated . Amis had filed against Brown in Sherman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm had succeeded in convincing District Judge Glen Ashworth literally to switch the plaintiff and defendant . Ashworth was going to allow a motion picture crew to create a re-enactment of the shooting for use in court . <p> In addition , Ashworth had granted a motion to force Amis to be examined by Dr. James Grigson , a psychiatrist nicknamed " Dr. Death " because he had testified for the prosecution in more than 2,000 trials . Grigson was later ousted from national and state psychiatric associations for making diagnoses without talking to the patients . <p> Ashworth 's ruling eventually was overturned by a higher court , but the process consumed Tyner 's efforts . David Brown , who continued as trustee and refused to relinquish that position , was contesting the will of Amis Sr. as well . Brown contended that the will , dated Nov. 1 , 1988 , making the junior Amis executor , was fraudulent and that the previous will , with Brown as executor , was correct . <p> As the civil wrangling continued , Tyner waived a speedy trial for Amis . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , and although it could have been forced to trial by April 1989 , it was left as an albatross around the neck of Bill Amis Jr . <p> " The civil suits were taking precedent , " says Tyner . " I was up to my eyeballs in them . " <p> Those suits and the circumstances surrounding them also created a strange void . Brown continued as trustee , but the shooting had left him a quadriplegic . He spent much of his time in therapy and the remainder at home . That left Amis executor of his father 's estate , operating the Amis companies , but with only murky authority to do so . <p> He also had only limited skill . Brown had made mistakes with the estate and Amis Jr . made worse ones . He could not read many of the papers before him and he had no grasp of the business , having never been initiated into it by his father . His eyesight led him to overlook important matters and his ignorance caused him to procrastinate . He paid only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to borrow to cover them . He signed checks intended for his dead father and generally created a larger mess than Brown had left for him . <p> In the meantime , Smith County District Attorney Jack Skeen and prosecutor David Dobbs were in no hurry to try their attempted-murder case . Instead , they waited while the Browns ' attorneys gathered it for them . <p> Then , on March 9 , 1991 , two years and five months after the shooting , David Brown died . <p> The death surprised everyone . Brown had been hospitalized for five months after the shooting with a bullet lodged near his spine . He had begun to recover , however , and had returned home . Still determined , he was doing isometric exercises and swimming . He had vowed to resume work and never relinquish the trust . <p> Like some others with spinal injuries , however , he was prone to pneumonia and , during a bout in the winter of 1991 , Dr. Maneeb Mellem had prescribed Rocephin . The strain of pneumonia from which Brown suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the disease rapidly worsened . <p> Mellem , who did not return Chronicle phone calls , signed the death certificate and listed the cause as " pneumonia due to gunshot wound . " <p> Brown 's family would never contest Mellem 's determination , despite the opinion of Dallas pathologist Dr. Linda Norton that prescribing Rocephin had been the cause of Brown 's death and constituted malpractice . <p> And , if Brown had died from a physician 's mistake , he could not have died as a result of being shot by Bill Amis Jr . <p> That death brought drastic changes . The civil battery suit quickly became a wrongful-death action with Brown 's wife as plaintiff . The attempted-murder case became murder and Amis Jr . ' s life became hell . <p> First , he was personally insolvent . Money still filtered into the trust , and the oil and gas holdings remained valuable . Amis , however , was limited by the trust to a $ 4,500-per-month stipend . His profitless cattle business and spending habits had outdistanced it and he had filed for bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tyner , asserting that he had been promised the Emerald Bay home and more than $ 200,000 for his fees , was demanding $ 450,000 . <p> At the same time , Amis ' faltering business efforts were beginning to tell . Creditors were beginning to call , a tornado had damaged one of the major Amis gas wells , and the Arizona mansion , never sold , was about to be seized by the bank . <p> With a murder indictment hanging over his head , his only champion in the legal community appeared to be Stuart Dowell . Dowell , a former Texas Ranger of wide repute in East Texas , had taken Amis ' case as one of his first as a private investigator . <p> " I want you to understand something , " Dowell told Amis . " If I find anything incriminating against you , I 'll drop it on the district attorney 's desk . " <p> He did n't . After interviewing more than 20 people and digging into the history of Brown and the Amis trust , Dowell was thoroughly convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father and that his fear of the judge was well-founded . <p> " Brown was determined to keep that trust at any cost and the day he was shot they were going to take that old man , " says Dowell . <p> Dowell believed Amis had a strong case of self-defense , as did Dr. Don Walker . Walker , a psychologist who has testified in numerous cases for both prosecution and defense , had examined Bill Amis Jr . at length in anticipation of a trial . <p> " Bill was a big guy physically , but he grew up intimidated by his father and formed a dependency relationship on him , " says Walker . " That made him very protective of his father . <p> " He 'd tried his own business and , at the time of the shooting , he was doing his best to stand on his own two feet , but he was n't equipped for it . The one thing he felt he could do was protect his father . <p> " He had reason to believe his father was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew to do to save him . <p> " And , I 'll tell you what else : Under the same circumstances I 'd have done exactly what he did . I did n't think any jury in Texas would convict him and I kept waiting to be called to testify . " <p> He never received that call , however . Nor did most of the witnesses Dowell had interviewed . The trial of Bill Amis Jr . would puzzle almost everyone . <p> It did n't come for more than a year . Both District Attorney Skeen and prosecutor Dobbs have refused to speak to the Chronicle about the case . Court records , however , show Amis was first indicted for murder on Aug. 1 , 1991 . That indictment was dismissed and another issued . After a series of dismissals and reindictments , he finally faced trial in August 1992 . <p> He faced it with a new lawyer , F.R. " Buck " Files . Files , well-respected in East Texas , walks a fine line as the private attorney on retainer to Smith County and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His reputation is excellent , however , and Amis felt secure . <p> Dowell handed over his investigation results to Files , and a parade of witnesses began streaming through the attorney 's office . Paula Gatlin handed over tapes she had made of Brown 's attempts to bribe her . Berta Blalock , Linda Gentry and others told of the kidnapping . Health workers told of Patterson 's treatment of Amis . <p> And all left with the reassurance from Files that " this is going to be one of the easiest cases I 've ever tried . " <p> Two weeks before the trial , however , Dowell began to worry . <p> " I asked Buck if we should n't be getting subpoenas out for our witnesses , " says Dowell . " He told me she ( state District Judge Cynthia Kent ) was n't going to let him put them on . " <p> Files did n't offer them . When asked about the case , Files says he has little recollection of the trial . No evidentiary hearing was held in which Files might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And the trial of Bill Amis Jr . began Aug. 25 , 1992 . <p> It opened without Joseph Patterson . The former " sitter , " called by the state , refused to appear willingly and was never subpoenaed from his home in Alabama . Instead , one of the first witnesses was his son , Timothy Patterson , whose story had changed drastically since the shooting . <p> At the trial Patterson said Amis was the aggressor and Brown was retreating as Amis fired . Under cross-examination he said simply that police had never asked who initiated the confrontation or whether Brown had been retreating when he was shot . <p> Blalock briefly recounted the weekend Amis Sr. was taken to the Ramada Inn , but she was never asked what Amis was told about the purpose of the trip or his sleep deprivation or lack of medication . She never recounted Brown 's verbal attacks on Amis Jr . or her complaints about Patterson 's treatment of the older Amis . <p> Gatlin told of her knowledge of the elder Amis , but her testimony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she touched on Brown 's offer to bribe her to get Amis to return to him . Jurors never heard of her tape-recordings or Brown 's boasts of taking money from the estates of widows he had represented . <p> Much of the testimony centered on Amis Jr . ' s ability or inability to see , though he had never contended that he did not intend to shoot Brown . An accountant was called , but was not allowed to detail Brown 's " substantial " billing of the trust . <p> No one spoke of Joseph Patterson 's abuse of Bill Amis Sr. or his actions to keep friends and family from speaking to the invalid . Dowell , Schleider , a few friends , a few acquaintances were called , and Newman Copeland testified briefly and drove home wondering why he had been asked to testify . <p> Schleider walked away with the feeling that " this is a miscarriage of justice . " <p> And Dowell left with a sick feeling in his gut about a system he had been part of for years . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political prisoner . " <p> Some jurors wondered about the case as well . During eight days of testimony they were removed from the courtroom 26 times , before and during the testimony of almost every defense witness . <p> Many of those removals were done as Dobbs and Files argued over Files ' attempts to elicit testimony about Brown 's irascible demeanor . Judge Kent had granted one standard prosecution motion preventing most hearsay statements made by Brown . That ruling excluded Brown 's outbursts against the younger Amis . <p> More significantly , Kent had granted a prosecution motion to prevent references to any " bad act that does not result in a final conviction against David Brown . " <p> While the defense argued that the evidence was needed to show Amis ' state of mind , the prosecution replied that it was merely an attempt to smear the victim 's good name . As a result , Jurors never heard of Minnetta Kern , Charles Easley or Brown 's censure . <p> And , after hearing eight days of testimony and deliberating 5 1/2 hours , jurors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Brown 's widow and children appeared relieved . Amis Jr . looked stricken . In the hallway outside the courtroom , Paul Brown congratulated the district attorney . <p> Brown has said he exerted no influence over the trial and has no recollection of ever talking to Skeen or Kent about the case . <p> " I can only say that my brother was an honorable man who did not deserve to die a quadriplegic as a result of being shot by Bill Amis Jr. , " he says . <p> Skeen , in a letter to the Chronicle , wrote , " I do not even personally recall meeting U.S. District Judge Paul Brown . . . . I may have talked to him somewhere before or during the trial . . . . <p> " Normally , I meet and talk with the family of murder victims even if I am not personally one of the prosecutors in the trial of the case . " <p> Brown , he wrote , " never at any time tried to influence the prosecution of the case . " <p> Dobbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not respond to calls or written inquiries except to refer questions to Skeen 's office . <p> Files , however , was quick to answer for the judge . " And , if you 're asking if Judge Kent was intimidated by Paul Brown , the answer is not only ' no , ' but ' hell no . ' " <p> Files says he remembers little about the case , but he is satisfied Amis received a fair hearing . <p> " I 'd take 20 years on a murder any day , " he says . <p> Several of the Amis jurors can no longer be found in Smith County . Among those who remain , four say they would be reluctant to second-guess their previous decision based on information they had not heard in trial . Two others were unswayed , saying Amis had no right to use a gun , despite what he might have thought or feared . <p> The remaining two , however , have said they would change their votes of guilty . <p> Larry Phillips , who held out for acquittal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters on Amis ' behalf to the Board of Pardons and Paroles . <p> And Bobby Gimble of Tyler says he has often had second thoughts about convicting Amis . <p> " We spent more time outside the courtroom than we did in it , " says Gimble . " I went ( into deliberations ) thinking the judge was just trying to help Bill Amis and Amis had shot a fine fellow . <p> " Years later I talked to some people from Sherman and learned different . <p> " Of course , the things we did n't hear would have made a difference . If I could back up now , I 'd turn Amis loose . " <p> Two jurors would have been more than sufficient . <p> On Sept. 3 , 1992 , as Phillips and Gimble left the Smith County Courthouse with misgivings over their votes , Amis Jr . was facing his first night in the county jail . <p> As he was sobbing in his cell , he heard a voice echo off the concrete walls , " Hey , ' Famous Amis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . <p> " Naw , man . You 're ' Famous Amis , ' " came the reply . " We all know what happened to you . " <p> Few know the outcome of the Amis story , however . <p> Amis was sent to prison , where he became one of the better-liked inmates among guards and other convicts alike . He watched as first his appeal failed , likewise his application for parole , despite a previously unblemished criminal record and 83 letters in his behalf . <p> The trust , however , the old wildcatter 's effort to protect his granddaughter , was buffeted among claimants , creditors and bankruptcy attorneys . <p> The personal financial failure of Amis Jr . and his father 's unsold Arizona mansion combined to force the trust into a precarious position . In the summer of 1992 , as Amis Jr . was heading to prison , Steve Flanagan , former accountant for the Amis companies who succeeded Brown as trustee , filed for bankruptcy for the trust . <p> It was an uncommon move . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of Texas were filing for $ 260,000 in unpaid taxes , however . The bank was about to foreclose on the mansion , and Tyner and the Browns had suits against the trust . <p> In addition , $ 553,000 was mysteriously missing . Glen Portman , an attorney with Arter-Haaden of Dallas who drew the bankruptcy plan , says he discovered that amount had disappeared . Portman believes the money was taken by Amis Jr . during 1991-92 , by cashing royalty checks made out to " Bill Amis " but actually intended for Bill Amis Sr. <p> Amis never spoke of the money . In fact , he borrowed commissary money from friends and other prisoners . One of his closest friends in prison was Chaplain John Larson , who spoke with Amis at length about his case , but never heard him speak of any cache . <p> " He never mentioned it , " says Larson . " He might not have , but I considered Bill a real friend . He also never seemed to have any money while he was in prison . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell his wife about it . I know he loved his wife and daughter and he would have wanted to provide for them . " <p> By 1999 he also knew he was dying . Amis had suffered from a weak heart , the Achilles ' heel of every man in his family . His health deteriorated in prison , he developed pneumonia , and he complained of not receiving medication to control his blood pressure . He had been growing sicker for months when he received his final visit from his wife and daughter Feb. 28 , 1999 . <p> On that day , Farrel Amis ' 16th birthday , he told his wife , " I do n't think I 'll be here for the next birthday . I feel terrible . " <p> " It was a sorrowful visit , " says Donna Amis . " He cried the whole time , not sobbing or loud , just tears that would start and he could n't stop them . " <p> Two weeks later , on March 3 , at age 52 , Bill Amis Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penniless . His cattle , horses , home and ranch were sold to satisfy taxes , the wrongful-death suit by the Brown family and Tyner 's claims . <p> Lawyers fell on the trust . Tyner took $ 150,000 and half the surface rights to the Philpick Field ( approximately 100 acres ) to settle for his fee . The other half of that land and Amis ' house there went to the Browns . Arter-Haaden , to date , has billed $ 620,000 for legal services and may seek more . Files took $ 65,000 . <p> And Donna Amis has remained in the dark . Considered an adversary by Arter-Haaden , she has received little or no information from that firm or from the trustee , Flanagan , about the status of the trust and its value , despite repeated inquiries over the past year . Files has retained most of the records of the criminal case . Tyner , saying he fears she might sue him , has refused to hand over any of the civil records to her . <p> And Farrel Amis , around whose head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirled , the child who was to be the sole beneficiary of the Amis trust , has received virtually nothing . <p> For the past year she has received her dead father 's Social Security , $ 673 per month . Medicare pays her pharmacy bills , but both stipends end when she turns 18 next month . She and her mother live in a small home , a former rent house owned by Donna Amis ' father , crowded with the furniture that once filled the Tres Vegas ranch house . <p> Farrel is a high school senior . Her cystic fibrosis notwithstanding , she works for the school newspaper and recently received a University Interscholastic League Press Conference award for her writing . She holds a part-time job and leads a relatively normal life . <p> " But I do n't talk to people about what happened to my father , " she says . " It 's not that it bothers me . It does n't . It 's that they do n't believe it . <p> " They say it sounds like a soap opera .
