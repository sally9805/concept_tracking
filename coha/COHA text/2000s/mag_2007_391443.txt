Headnote MAKE A HUGE LEAP FORWARD : TARGET YOUR WEAK SPOT AND CRUSH IT . A bicycle ride is at once so simple and so complex . It is your life pared down , just you and the outdoors , away from stress and obligation , or just you and your speed and watts and beats per minute . Yet it is also multifaceted , requiring several types of fitness for your body to motor , climb , sprint and last all day long . Each of us is stronger in some areas and weaker in others . If you 've been riding consistently all year , there 's probably not much room to improve in the areas in which you 're already strong . The key to making a big leap forward before the year is done is to focus on your weakness . " The fastest way to boost your performance is to identify your primary limiter and change your training in ways that push it back , " says elite-level cycling coach Hunter Allen , coauthor with Andrew Coggin , Ph.D. , of Training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be anything , depending on factors from your natural physiology to your riding habits . To strengthen it , you must first identify it . Then , use these workouts to attack it head-on . Sidebar If you want to become a stronger rider , annihilate your limiters . Sidebar A SINGLE BICYCLE RIDE REQUIRES SEVERAL TYPES OF FITNESS FOR YOUR BODY TO MOTOR , CLIMB , SPRINT AND LAST ALL DAY LONG . IS IT ALL IN YOUR HEAD ? WHEN YOUR WEAKNESS IS N'T PHYSICAL In the past decade , exercise scientists have gathered increasing evidence that the primary performance limiter in every athlete is the brain , the organ responsible for preventing you from pushing to the point of serious self-harm during races and tough workouts . During a ride , your brain constantly monitors chemical and electrical signals from your muscles and other organs that give feedback on your body temperature , level of muscle damage , dehydration , muscle pH balance and other health indicators . When your brain interprets one of these messages as a warning of impending bodily harm , it reduces electrical output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to slow down and avoid danger . Previously , exercise scientists believed that fatigue was caused-hence performance was limited-by bodily breakdowns such as overheating , muscle glycogen depletion and loss of muscle pH balance ( i.e. , increases in muscle acidity caused by leakage of hydrogen protons from hardworking muscle fibers ) . But the latest research shows that the brain causes the fatigue to happen before any real breakdown occurs . For example , in a recent study from the University of Cape Town , South Af rica , cyclists completed a pair of 35k time trials , one at a cool 59 degrees Fahrenheit and one at a scorching 95 degrees . Researchers recorded finishing times , body temperature and electrical output from the brain to the muscles . As expected , the hot environment had a negative effect on time-trial performance . Electrical output from the brain to the muscles was also reduced in the hot time trial , though body temperature rose to almost exactly the same level in both time trials . Taken together , these results suggest that exercise performance in the heat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temperature-related decline in muscle performance , but because the brain reduces motor output to the muscles to prevent the body from becoming too hot . Brain-initiated fatigue is no less real than body-initiated fatigue . You ca n't ride harder just by realizing your subconscious brain is holding you back and then overriding this self-protective mechanism . But there is some evidence that cyclists can essentially recalibrate the calculations the brain uses to set performance limits . The key is to regularly subject your body-and brainto the kind of stress in training that you 'll experience in a race or event . Here are three ways to train your brain for better cycling performance . MIX IT UP Your brain monitors many types of fatigue signals while you 're riding , but all it takes is one red flag to trigger a protective response . The various fatigue signals are affected differently by different types of training . A well-rounded training program in which you regularly push your body to the point of fatigue in all five components of cycling fitness ( see chart ) will minimize the chances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COUNT Research has shown that athletes ' brains are able to drive their muscles harder when a performance test is more meaningful to them . Even low-key tune-up races tend to be more meaningful than a plain old workout , so sprinkling your schedule with races is a great way to experience especially hard efforts that push back your brain 's protective limits . DO N'T SHOCK THE SYSTEM The brain tends to react to the unknown with caution , so the more accustomed your body and brain are to the specific challenges of your goal event or race , the less likely it is to send those signals that cause you to fatigue prematurely . Be sure that some of your training as closely as possible simulates the big day in terms of intensity , duration , weather and terrain so that on race day your brain will think , " Been there , done that . " - MF . YOU FEEL LIKE : " I end up gasping for reath before my legs give out on hard rides . " OR " It takes me a long time-often 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS : AEROBIC CAPACITY " Aerobic capacity refers to the body 's ability to use oxygen to release energy in the muscles while riding , " says USA Cycling elite-level coach Jeb Stewart , owner and head coach of Endurofit.com . When oxygen processing is your weak spot , you will tend to have that " sucking wind " feeling even when your muscles still are strong . Because the aerobic system is also the one primarily responsible for postride recovery , not bouncing back from hard workouts is another sign that your aerobic engine needs attention . TO ATTACK IT : SNEAKY MILES Aerobic capacity is closely linked to training volume . Adding even an hour or 2 of riding per week will boost your aerobic fitness noticeably . One manageable way to bump training volume is to go for an easy recovery ride of 30 to 90 minutes within 24 hours of a hard ride . You might not think this would have much of an effect on fitness , but recent studies show that when athletes start even an easy exercise session in a state of lingering fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interleukin-6 , an immunesystem messenger compound that stimulates fat-burning efficiency and resistance to muscle damage , among other things . If you ca n't fit an extra recovery ride into your schedule , try doubling or tripling the length of your cooldown at the end of a hard ride instead . YOU FEEL LIKE : " I bonk sooner than I should during long rides , even when I eat and drink enough . " OR " I get muscle cramps during my longer rides . " YOUR LIMITER IS : ENDURANCE To ride long successfully , your body needs to develop the ability to store large amounts of glycogen , or carbohydrate fuel , in your legs and to burn fat efficiently during cycling . If you lack these adaptations , which accrue as a gradual result of depleting your muscle glycogen stores in longer-than-normal rides , no amount of drinking and eating will help . You will experience either complete muscle exhaustion or debilitating leg cramps . TO ATTACK IT : HIGH-TEMPO INTERVALS The obvious way to boost endurance is to do a weekly long ride , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up to 4 hours . But this workout from Stewart helps you go longer without adding ride time . Endurance gains result mainly from depleting your muscle glycogen stores in training rides . These intervals are performed at a higher intensity than a standard ride , so they deplete glycogen stores faster . * Start a 2-hour ride with a 15-minute warm-up , then , depending on your fitness , do either 2 to 4x10 minutes , 2 to 3x15 minutes or 2 to 3x20 minutes at just below lactate threshold ( 80 to 85 percent of max heart rate or 90 to 95 percent of 40k time-trial speed/ power ) . Recover after each with 5 minutes of easy spinning . YOU FEEL LIKE : " I bonk abruptly when trying to sustain a high intensity . " OR " I feel overwhelmed by the speed of time trials and tyne-trial-mtensity workouts . " YOUR LIMITER IS : LACTATE THRESHOLD " A simple definition of lactate threshold is the maximum power you can sustain for 1 hour , " says Alien , which is roughly the speed at 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your limiter , you 'll notice you ca n't ride at 85 percent of your max heart rate for an hour , and that your max sustainable speed/power is too low . A trained cyclist should be able to churn out at least 30 percent more speed/ power in a max-effort hour ride than in a moderate one . TO ATTACK IT : MICROBURSTS Allen uses a workout he calls microbursts to efficiently raise an athlete 's lactate threshold . After warming up , do 15 seconds " on " at a near sprint ( 150 percent of your threshold power , if you have a power meter ) , then do 15 seconds " off " at an easy spin ( 50 percent of your threshold power ) . Continue for 10 minutes . " It 's totally annoying , " says Alien , but effective . Unlike steady-pace lactate threshold workouts , he explains , microbursts work primarily by challenging your body to quickly and repeatedly recover from high-intensity muscle fatigue . " Plus , you get a tremendous boost in your ability to change speeds , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen recommends preceding this with windout sprints ( below ) to get 2 distinct benefits from a single ride . YOU FEEL LIKE : " My performance drops quickly after the first effort of an interval workout . " OR " I struggle with speeding up from an already hard pace , even for a minute . " YOUR LIMITER IS : ANAEROBIC CAPACITY In practical terms , anaerobic capacity refers to your ability to recover quickly from very hard efforts-those exceeding lactate-threshold intensity-and to repeat such efforts multiple times before you experience a drop in performance . TO ATTACK IT : NEAR-MAX INTERVALS There 's no way around it : To nudge your anaerobic capacity higher , you need to do short intervals at near-max effort . After a 15-minute warm-up , do one of these workouts from Stewart . In each , ride the hard parts at the highest intensity you can sustain through the last interval without blowing up . These are hard . * Two to 4 sets of 3 to 5x30 seconds hard and 90 seconds easy spinning , with 5 to 10 minutes easy spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by 3 minutes of spinning , with 5 to 10 minutes of spinning between sets . * Two sets of 5x2 minutes hard followed by 3 minutes of spinning , with 5 to 10 minutes of spinning between sets . YOU FEEL LIKE : " I get dropped on steep , short climbs and ca n't keep up when someone in the group attacks . " OR " I have no " snap " in my legs . " YOUR LIMITER IS : MAXIMUM POWER This is the ability to contract and relax the muscles very quickly , " says Stewart . There is a common misconception that maximum power is something only sprinters need . In fact , the best climbers and time trialists tend to have greater top-end power than those less proficient , so boosting your maximum power is a great way to improve your all-around performance . TO ATTACK IT : WIND-OUT SPRINTS Power is the ability to apply force quickly . Cyclists typically train for power by emphasizing force ( i.e. , by pushing big gears ) . But Alien 's high-rev sprints emphasize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains without a big time commitment . * After a thorough warm-up , start at a slow speed , only 5 to 8 miles per hour , and in your small chainring and a middle gear on your cassette . Do a 10-second all-out sprint with only 1 or 2 gear changes . Wind out the gear before you shift , like you do in a car , going up to 120 rpm before upshifting . Complete 6 to 8 sprints , recovering 2 minutes after each sprint . Allen suggests doing wind-outs and then moving on to microbursts ( above ) . These workouts , recommended by coaches Alien and Stewart , are designed to address your primary weakness . Add the one you need most to your training regimen once a week .
