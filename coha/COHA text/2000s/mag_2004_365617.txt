IT USED TO BE NICE TO sit next to A.J. Jacobs at a dinner party . He 's funny , smart , polite and totally nonthreatening-looking . But ever since he read the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica  --  which he did to write his hilarious book , The Know-It-All : One Man 's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World ( Simon &; Schuster ; 386 pages )  --  it is best to sit far , far away . His blurting of arcana has got so bad , his wife started fining him $1 for every irrelevant fact he crowbarred into conversation . " She was lenient , " he told TIME . " I got away with $150 . She could have gotten $1,000 . " <P> The book succeeds because , unlike in real life , Jacobs ( an Esquire editor and NPR contributor ) confines his written observations on Encyclopaedia Britannica articles to jottings the length of entries in Schott 's Original Miscellany . ( Among the facts he highlights : the Bayer company invented heroin ; toward the end of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper ; Ren Descartes liked cross-eyed chicks . ) Instead , he uses his book , which is organized by Encyclopaedia Britannica entries , to do what he has done best as a magazine writer : stunt journalism . The entry on " Vital Fluid " leads to a story about getting on TV as a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , though he wins only $1,000 because he 'd already forgotten the E volume , where " Erythrocyte " was defined . " Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , Academy of " is an excuse to retell his story of pretending to be Shine actor Noah Taylor at the Oscars because they looked somewhat alike . It works surprisingly well until Jacobs tries to fool Shine star Geoffrey Rush . <P> What keeps the book from being no more than a series of alphabetically arranged humor columns is the leitmotif of becoming a man : Jacobs somehow turns the effort of reading 33,000 pages into the world 's most passive Bildungsroman . The project , it seems , springs less from an urge to soak up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His brilliant lawyer father , who is so competitive that he holds the record for most footnotes in a legal article , once attempted to read the Encyclopaedia Britannica but quit in the B 's . But even more important to Jacobs ' emotional maturation than one-upping his dad is dealing with the tension of failing , over and over , to get his wife pregnant . Although , really , you do n't expect a guy who goes to the Britannica headquarters in Chicago to report two errors to have boys that swim really fast . <P> But it 's the stunt of the book itself that allows the funny , touching memoir to be so stuffed with nutritious bits of trivia that you feel smart for reading it . Jacobs has done the time-consuming work of unearthing the most interesting parts of the Encyclopaedia Britannica . ( Seriously , Descartes liked cross-eyed women . ) " There were times during the ' Plate Tectonics ' section I regretted starting it , " he says . " But now I 'm happy . At least I 've accomplished something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is what the book is about , and it has nothing to do with reading the Britannica . <P>  --  By Joel Stein
