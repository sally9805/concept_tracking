Thanks to a breeding revolution , these are n't your grandma 's flowers // Over the lost 10 years , the humble petunia has become one exciting flower . Some kinds can now spread color over a 6-foot circle . Others can extend their flower-laden stems from a hanging basket all the way to the ground . Still others can sprout into 2-foot-tall fountains . It 's a breeding revolution-all because two Japanese beverage companies , Kirin and Suntory , got into the petunia business . Why would conglomerates better known for beer and whiskey bother with petunias ? With plant breeders already on staff , both companies saw the chance to diversify into petunias , which rank among the world 's best-selling plants . Each entered the market with petunias that grew nearly twice as large as any previous variety , inspiring other Asian growers as well as European , Australian , and American cultivators to try to match them . Collectively , these breeding efforts have paid dividends to home gardeners , who can now choose from a wide range of plant forms and flower colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right choices .

In the low and intermediate deserts ( Sunset Western Garden Book climate zones 12 and 13 ) , plant petunias in the fall . Choose a series like Jamboree or Supertunia , which can set flower buds during the cool season , when there are fewer daylight hours . Light . Full sun produces the most blooms . Petunias will take some shade , but the deeper the shade , the fewer the flowers and the more leggy plants will become as they stretch for light . Soil . Petunias like soil that 's rich in organic matter , which also facilitates drainage and retains moisture . Watering . Never let soil dry out completely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily . Feeding . At planting time , fortify the soil with slow-release fertilizer , then feed plants twice a month with a halfstrength liquid fertilizer . Deadheading . You 'll get more flowers and longer bloom if you remove faded blossoms . Self-cleaning varieties drop spent flowers naturally . Pest control . In California , geranium ( tobacco ) budworm can chew up petunia leaves and buds . The most effective biological control is to spray plants with Bacillus thuringiensu ( Bt ) at the first sign of damage . A shopper 's guide to petunias // When you shop at nurseries or garden centers , read the plant labels . Even plants within the same series ( like Surfinia ) come in surprisingly different forms . If the petunias are n't labeled , ask the staff if they can identify the particular series or variety . For trailing types of petunias , whether they are grown from cuttings or started from seed accounts for certain differences in their appearance , performance , packaging , and price , as you 'll note in the chart below .

This plant spreads and mounds like petunias , but its 1-inch-wide flowers resist the geranium ( tobacco ) budworms that chew petunias . Since Calibrachoa freely drops its faded flowers , you never have to deadhead . Treat Calibrachoa as a warm-season annual in Sunset climate zones 2-24 . However , in mild-winter areas of California ( zones 8 , 9 , 14-24 ) , Calibrachoa can be grown as a perennial ( it 's hardy to about 23 ) . Million Bells , the first series on the market , comes in both trailing and mounding forms . The new Superbells series has slightly larger blooms in the blue , pink , red , and white range . For warm tones , look for the MiniFamous series . // <p>
