<p> President Bush 's veto Wednesday of a bipartisan bill that would expand health insurance for 10 million children from lower-income families will not immediately disrupt Colorado 's program . <p> It could , however , derail plans to extend coverage to about 57,000 more Colorado children at a time when the number with private insurance is shrinking , critics say . <p> Republican leaders expressed confidence that they have enough votes to make the veto stick in the House . <p> " Poor kids first , " Bush said in explaining his decision , reflecting concern that some of the bill 's benefits would go to families at higher income levels . <p> The president said he is willing to compromise with Congress " if they need a little more money in the bill to help us meet the objective of getting help for poor children . " <p> " Congress will fight hard to override President Bush 's heartless veto , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev . <p> Democratic leaders scheduled the showdown for Oct. 18 to allow two weeks for pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from polling data as they settled in for their struggle . <p> Democracy Corps said its poll showed the public overwhelmingly supports Democrats . <p> House Republicans distributed a survey that said critics of the legislation can win the public debate if they say they favor " covering uninsured children without expanding government coverage to adults , illegal immigrants and those who already have insurance , " according to a copy obtained by The Associated Press . <p> Colorado 's program , - Child Health Plan Plus , or CHP+ - has enough in reserve to continue through next year , said Joanne Lindsay , spokeswoman for the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing . <p> Under the vetoed plan , Colorado could have received about $85 million in 2008 if state legislators approved , according to Families USA , a consumer-advocacy group . <p> It would have allowed the state to more than double the number of covered children , which was about 53,000 as of July . <p> " President Bush 's veto will put a lot of Colorado kids at risk , " said Lorez Meinhold with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faith-based and business groups . <p> CHP+ is a low-cost plan for Colorado children who are U.S. citizens or have been legal permanent residents for at least five years . Their families can earn up to 200 percent of the federal poverty-level income - too much to receive Medicaid benefits but often not enough to afford private health insurance . <p> The Colorado plan is a federal-state partnership . The federal funding is 65 percent of the cost . CHP+ also covers 1,264 pregnant women , 19 or older , who do not have Medicaid or other health insurance . <p> The vetoed bill would have reauthorized the 1997 State Children 's Health Insurance Program and boosted its funding by $35 billion - to provide a total of $60 billion over the next five years . It would have extended coverage to an additional 4 million children but also created barriers for states seeking to cover uninsured children in families making more than three times the federal poverty level , or about $62,000 . <p> The money would have come from an increase in the 39-cent-a-pack federal tax on cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill Sept. 27 with enough votes , a two-thirds majority , to override a veto . The House , which voted 265 to 159 on Sept. 25 , did not . The bill would need 289 votes.The Colorado congressional delegation split along party lines . <p> The president , who wants to increase funding by only $5 billion , said the expanded plan is a dangerous step in the direction of government-run health care . He said it would encourage middle-class parents to drop private health insurance and rely instead on taxpayers . <p> " The president said he wants to keep the status quo , but because of ( rising costs ) , it actually means cutting kids or services , " said Tara Trujillo , director of health initiatives for the Colorado Children 's Campaign . <p> In Colorado , the numbers of children covered by private insurance were already falling . <p> Private insurance covered about 815,000 Colorado children , or about 70 percent , last year , according to a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study . That represented a decline of 11 percent since 1997 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of children enrolled in public health insurance had grown by 69 percent , to 184,000 . <p> Still , about 180,000 Colorado children have no insurance . <p> " A veto makes no sense from our perspective , " said Kraig Burleson , CEO of Denver 's Inner City Health Center . " Our role is to catch the people who fall through the cracks . Those cracks are becoming crevasses . " <p> Denver Post wire services contributed to this report . Congress reacts <p> " While I support the reauthorization of SCHIP , I do not support legislation that expands the program and serves as an initial step toward government-run health care . " <p> Sen. Wayne Allard , R-Colo . <p> " It is reprehensible that ( President Bush ) has chosen against investing in the health and well-being of our nation 's children , which is our moral and economic obligation . " <p> Sen. Ken Salazar , D-Colo . <p> " Despite the falsehoods in ( Bush 's ) rhetoric , this compromise bill targets the lowest-income uninsured American children whose parents ca n't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat <p> " The bill . has a large tax increase that hits low-income folks the hardest . It would allow illegal aliens to receive free American health care by abolishing certain paperwork requirements . " <p> Rep. Marilyn Musgrave , a Fort Morgan <p> Republican <p> " The bleak reality of this veto is that the president is denying health care insurance for 60,000 low-income children in Colorado . " <p> Rep. Mark Udall , <p> a Democrat from <p> Eldorado Springs <p> Bush 's " lack of concern for working families is clear . His priority is to continue this war in Iraq at the expense of our children . " <p> Rep. John Salazar , <p> a Manassa Democrat <p> " I support the president 's decision to veto this bill . It raises taxes , expands entitlement spending and makes it easier for illegal aliens to obtain government benefits . All of those are bad things . " <p> Rep. Tom Tancredo ,
