<p> Debra Davis knows Atlanta has a reputation for high taxes and low-performing schools . <p> But on a recent afternoon , she was encouraging her neighbors in the Sandtown community of south Fulton County to sign a petition that would allow their children to become part of Atlanta 's public school system . <p> Like many community residents , she feels ignored by Fulton officials and sees opportunity in joining neighboring Atlanta . If it 's annexed , Sandtown could get better treatment as part of the city , she said . <p> " The schools that are performing the best are the schools where the community is most involved , " she said . " Each system has issues . " <p> There are many more steps in the process , but if Atlanta accepts Sandtown , it would be the city 's largest annexation since 1952 , when Atlanta added about 100,000 residents of Buckhead . <p> The talk of defection  --  no matter the reason  --  is reverberating throughout Fulton County . One new city has formed , and at least four other communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southwest of Atlanta has about 17,000 people , said John Davis , president of the Sandtown Community Association , a homeowners association that represents about 10 percent of residents and is organizing the effort . Proponents hope to submit a proposal to Atlanta by July 31 , the city-imposed deadline . <p> The effort has critics . Opposition centers on two issues  --  Atlanta 's taxes , which are higher than unincorporated Fulton 's , and its school test scores , which often fall below state and national averages . Fulton 's scores often exceed averages . <p> Despite that , proponents hope they have enough support . <p> Sandtown is home to some of the wealthiest and most politically active residents in south Fulton . Its three public schools are among the highest achieving in the area and the most crowded . Many parents say the Fulton schools system has not delivered on promises of renovations and new schools . <p> Although one issue is the perception that south Fulton residents receive fewer county services than people in other parts of the county , frustration with the county school system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort to ditch Fulton . <p> The process can begin if advocates collect signatures from 60 percent of registered voters and from the owners of 60 percent of the acreage . <p> " If 60 percent of Sandtown decides to be annexed by Atlanta , the Fulton County school board can blame themselves for that , " said James Harris , an attorney and father of four . His school-age children attend Fulton schools . <p> Other parents said they have too many unanswered questions or were flat-out opposed to joining Atlanta . <p> Pamela McIver 's two teenagers attend school in Sandy Springs under a transfer program . She does n't want to lose that flexibility . " This has n't been well thought out , " she said . " I do n't think they fully understand the total impact of becoming annexed by the City of Atlanta , and what that means to students . I do n't think they understand how that would impact their children . " <p> Fulton school Superintendent James Wilson said he understood parents were frustrated with crowding , but the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county , " he said . " Unfortunately , we are not building fast enough . But we are certainly trying . " <p> The school system 's projections indicate 13 of the 15 fastest-growing schools are south of Atlanta . <p> The community has three schools  --  Randolph Elementary , Sandtown Middle and Westlake High . But the buildings are the property of the Fulton school system . If the community is annexed , the Atlanta schools would have to negotiate with Fulton to acquire the properties , Wilson said . <p> Sandtown Middle is at the center of the community and has become a symbol of its discontent . <p> The school was crowded a year after its 2004 opening . Portable classrooms consume most of the faculty parking lot . The school expects 1,800 students this year  --  more than many of the county 's high schools and 600 students over capacity . <p> Fulton system leaders will not redistrict to relieve pressure on the school until a new middle school opens in south county , possibly in August 2007 . But parents say they have been promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The aging Westlake High , for example , has been scheduled for replacement for several years . Construction has yet to begin . <p> Harris is fed up . " That 's what we 've been dealing with in this community : total insensitivity by the school board , " he said . " And we do n't see it changing anytime soon . " <p> Wilson said children could get a good education in either system , but the Fulton system should be given a chance to open schools it has planned . <p> " Redistricting is not a solution . It 's a Band-Aid , " he said . " The real solution is to build new schools , and we are doing that . " <p> Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin has welcomed the annexation proposal . But the city did n't initiate it . Franklin wrote a letter in May , inviting south Fulton communities to join the city after the Sandtown Community Association approached her staff . <p> Community leaders who favor annexation say they need the support of at least a few thousand people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed . On a scorching afternoon , Davis , the association president , and some of his neighbors collected signatures at Regency Hills , one of Sandtown 's newer developments . <p> One man walked away , laughing , after Davis invited him to sign . " Not Atlanta , " he scoffed . <p> Others signed and promised to send their spouses . Within 30 minutes , the petition had half a dozen names . <p> Some taxpayers who favored annexation said remaining with Fulton was n't much of an option because they feel the ground shifting beneath their feet . <p> They cited incorporation efforts in north Fulton , which could sap strength from the county 's tax base . The break-away city of Sandy Springs already has affected county services . The tax-rich community , just north of Atlanta 's Buckhead neighborhood , became a city last December after a three-decade effort . <p> Some Sandtown residents said they had no interest in joining other south county communities to create a city for themselves , a " city of South Fulton . " <p> Finally , with talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north Fulton , some people worried that Sandtown would be left as the wealthiest enclave in what remains of the old Fulton County . <p> For parents such as Harvey Davis , the choice was down to the lesser of two evils : Stay with Fulton and see what comes . Or join Atlanta , where he sees some momentum and the possibility to negotiate a better deal for children in Sandtown . <p> " I do n't think it 's a difficult sell if people take the time to learn the facts , and if people make decisions based on facts , as opposed to perceptions and feelings , " he said . " Atlanta is a different city than it was 10 to 15 years ago . You have folks who say , ' Well , I intentionally moved to unincorporated south Fulton County . ' But the dynamics have changed . You wo n't have unincorporated areas anymore . " <p> The county has not determined how much tax money would be lost if Sandtown left for Atlanta , said Bill Edwards , a Fulton County commissioner whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss , he said , but Sandtown would n't be as big . <p> If the community wants to join Atlanta , Edwards said , that 's their choice . " We 're saying we 'd like to see you here . We 'd like to keep you . But if you want to go , go . " <p> Atlanta has estimated it would take in more money than it would spend if it annexed Sandtown . The revenues would be about $26 million a year compared with $23 million in expenses . But that 's an estimate , said Robbie Ashe , a mayoral aide . <p> The economic model included the section of the Cascade neighborhood in unincorporated Fulton . And that neighborhood was not part of the annexation petitions . <p> The city analysis also did not include the cost of public education , Ashe said . <p> If Atlanta does n't annex Sandtown by Oct. 31 , the community will become part of the proposal for the city of South Fulton , which will go before voters next year . <p> Staff researcher Alice Wertheim contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2006 <p> CORRECTION : <p> A Sunday Metro section story about the south Fulton community of Sandtown considering annexation by the city of Atlanta incorrectly described the neighborhoods that were included in the city 's last major annexation . In addition to Buckhead , the communities that were annexed in 1952 included Bolton , Cascade Heights , Adamsville and Lakewood Heights .
