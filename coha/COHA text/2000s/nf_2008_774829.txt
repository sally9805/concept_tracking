The Pretty Good Problem // Rational Thinking ... Fifty-three Pretty Good Kitchen Ranges ... The Commodity T ... Ecko Unltd. ' s cul-de-sac cred ... The " projectability " of Hello Kitty ... The Hundreds // Rational Thinking // Imagine that you 're naked . // Or maybe it 's better to put it this way : Imagine that you need some sort of clothing . This may not be a biological imperative like thirst , but wearing something is still pretty much a baseline acceptable social behavior . How , then , do you choose to meet this authentic consumer need ? // Cram as many responses to that question as will fit into the two million square feet of exhibition space at the Las Vegas Convention Center , and you have Magic . Magic is a twice yearly trade show for the apparel industry , a place where makers of clothes gather to display their wares for the benefit of retail buyers-the people who decide what boutiques and department stores all over the world will make available to consumers . Most every brand that you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeans , from Jhane Barnes to Timberland ) , along with many brands you probably could not think of . // The geography of Magic is the geography of consumer demographics : Sections are labeled Young Men 's , Magic Kids , Active Lifestyle , Casual Lifestyle , Women 's Sportswear , Dresses and Outerwear , and Streetwear . The mode of Magic is mercenary tribalism : buyers and sellers roaming the floor in their signifying outfits ( there 's a couture guy , here 's a hip-hop girl , there goes a Japanese hipster kid ) , cutting their deals , while the trend prospectors and fashion editors study the action , looking for the smallest flicker of a pattern change in the garment zeitgeist . The language of Magic is an endless babel of logos and brands . // Part of the reason for my first trip to Magic , in early 2005 , was to connect with Bobby Kim , otherwise known as Bobby Hundreds . I had met him in Los Angeles some months earlier , and he seemed likely to be a great help to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer marketplace . He was twenty-five years old , a Korean American who grew up in multicultural Los Angeles and was into hip-hop , punk , and skateboarding . He was the kind of person the youth-obsessed marketing industry chases relentlessly , and he knew it . But he scorned mainstream efforts to speak to his generation . I 'd been struck , for example , by an essay on his Web zine blasting the " commercialized " version of skateboarding culture that he saw in the X Games or on MTV as a " big-industry ruse . " // So that 's Bobby Hundreds : He is hard to impress . I 'm making him sound like a cynic , but that 's not the case . He 's a smart guy with a lot of hustle ; he has the highest standards , the greatest expectations , the biggest dreams . He 's the new consumer , the nightmare of the brand managers and retail buyers who make Magic hum . We 'll spend more time with him later ; but for now , all you need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with a knowing smirk . He saw through the whole charade-just as the experts said he should . All these brands have no meaning ; each one was , he said , " just another clothing line . " // If brands and logos are mere symbols , empty of meaning , then choosing among clothing lines-or anything-becomes a largely rational affair . There are probably four , or maybe four and a half , factors to consider . One , of course , is price . Another is convenience . A third is quality . The fourth rational factor , I think it 's fair to say , is pleasure . The half factor is ethics , which I 'll leave aside for now but return to later , in this book 's final section . // Needless to say , these ideas not only collide , but bleed into one another : You can derive pleasure from the simple fact of a bargain 's low price , for example . To borrow a term from economics , the goal of the rational consumer is to " maximize utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a given purchase . A vacuum cleaner that does a nice job on your carpets is both useful and satisfying ( assuming you want your carpets clean ) ; a vacuum cleaner that leaves the carpet looking just as filthy as it did before you bought the thing probably isn't. // It 's a simple enough framework for decision making , one that marginalizes squishier ideas like brand image . It 's also consistent with what twenty-first-century consumers tell surveyors about how we make decisions : We regularly claim that logos mean little or nothing to us . Those polled by GfK Roper Consulting on the subject of why they buy what they buy named " past experience " with a given brand , followed by quality , price , and " personal recommendations of others . " Only about a fifth were willing to cite branding as a factor at all . Another survey , focused specifically on apparel , suggested that most consumers had wised up to all the hype about new styles and trends and that a majority agreed that " fashion is less important to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course you and I are more interested in rational concerns like " value and comfort " than on frivolous trends . " Buying a $5,000 handbag just because it 's a status symbol is a sign of weakness , " as one keen observer of branded culture put it . Who was that keen observer ? Miuccia Prada , overseer of the famous luxury brand . ( Presumably , buying a $5,000 Prada bag is okay , if you 're doing it for the right reasons-quality and value , for instance. ) // This summarizes the thinking of those who point to the emerging superdemanding new consumer . Like Homo economicus- " Economic Man , " the strictly rational cost/benefit maximizer of economic models-the new Consumer Economicus sorts through the explosion of available information and makes his or her best choice . Consumer Economicus is not swayed by branding , " status symbols , " or anything else that smacks of phony image making . // Yet it 's hard to square this with the endless choices on view at Magic . There must be a million products here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , cut , form . But how many differences can there be ? Shirts , pants , dresses , shoes . These are the essential tropes . Are there really so many quality and style variations ? // The answer is in the Desire Code , my name for the complex of factors , rational and otherwise , that spark us to make particular purchase decisions . The backdrop for cracking that code-and the reason it 's getting more complicated to crack-is the most interesting thing on display at Magic , a thing that absolutely nobody talked about , even though it was obvious everywhere you looked : the Pretty Good Problem . // fifty-three pretty good kitchen ranges // A couple of years ago , Consumer Reports tested and ranked fifty-three different kitchen ranges , priced from $400 to $5,200 . Of these , it found that forty-seven were , over all , " very good . " Four were " excellent . " The lowest composite rating , given to a $1,100 Frigidaire dual-fuel model and a $750 GE gas range , was " good . " None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Barry Schwartz is a psychology professor at Swarthmore College with a particular interest in the incredible ( and at times paralyzing ) abundance of options available to the contemporary consumer . He wrote a book about it , The Paradox of Choice . Once upon a time , the challenge for the consumer was navigating a world of faulty , shoddy , or unsafe products . But really , Schwartz argues , that 's not much of an issue anymore . The fifty-three pretty good kitchen ranges are a routine example of something that he sees happening in practically every consumer category . So when Consumer Reports , or whatever other authority is doing the testing , studies some group of products , the conclusion is invariably that most of the choices are , you know , pretty good . All that 's left is to sift among increasingly minor differences to decide which one is the very best value of all , by however absurdly narrow a margin . And while we may feel otherwise sometimes , the simple fact is that there are probably more pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history . This is a tribute to progress , but it both complicates our decision-making as consumers and makes it increasingly difficult for one of those fifty- three ranges to stand out . // While Schwartz approaches this problem from the point of view of the befuddled and overwhelmed consumer , Seth Godin is among those who look at it from the marketer 's perspective . Godin is the author of many marketing- and business-advice books , including one called Purple Cow . The title is explained in an anecdote about driving through France with his family ; at first they were " enchanted " by the " storybook cows " they saw , but within twenty minutes , the sight of these animals had become familiar , and " boring . " If a purple cow were to come into view , however- " that would be interesting , " Godin wrote . // His point was that " most products are invisible , " as is most marketing , and this means things must be made " remarkable " if they are to have a chance to succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about . The first edition of Purple Cow , for example , included a limited number distributed in milk carton-like containers . // It 's important to parse the metaphor closely : The cow is not remarkable because it produces more milk or requires less feed or also functions as an M player and digital camera . Its purpleness is not an innovation , it 's a novelty . The cow-or the kitchen appliance or the garment-still functions much like all its marketplace rivals . Except that it 's purple . Which is " remarkable . " // the commodity t // The Pretty Good Problem is even more acute at Magic than it is in the pages of Consumer Reports or , possibly , the picturesque pastures of France . The more narrow the range of actual differences in commodity attributes , the more important it becomes to create a different kind of value-one that transcends the merely material . This is the goal of branding . // It 's easy to think of branding as a transparent and almost pointless process : Huge companies buying TV ads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite of honest and authentic expression , let alone novelty . A mere logo , then , seems an unlikely way to achieve Godin 's state of purpleness . But there is more to branding than that . Branding is really a process of attaching an idea to a product . A hundred years ago or more-when consumers started to choose ( for instance ) factory-sealed containers of flour marked Pillsbury , rather than buying flour of unknown provenance and quality out of open vats-that idea might have been strictly utilitarian and rational : trustworthy , effective , a bargain . Over time , and thanks in part to the sprawling abundance that production improvements offered , the ideas attached to products have by necessity become more elaborate and ambitious . This is why , for example , a widely discussed and award-winning campaign for Dove skin cleansers-featuring women who were decidedly less svelte than the models traditionally used in advertising images-took the form of a grandiose statement on the nature of beauty itself . // If a product is successfully tied to an idea , branding persuades people-whether they admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea by consuming the product . Even companies like Apple and Nike , while celebrated for the tangible attributes of their products , work hard to associate themselves with abstract notions of nonconformity or achievement . A potent brand becomes a form of identity in shorthand . It solves the Pretty Good Problem . // Here is one tool for understanding how this plays out in the market : the T-shirt . The T-shirt , really , is nothing . A former undergarment popularized as outerwear by World War II veterans who enjoyed their " skivvy " shirts on the often balmy Pacific front , it is today the plain brown cow of clothing , the sartorial equivalent of tap water . On a functional level , T-shirt innovation has not been radical compared with , say , the evolution in music-listening products . A time traveler from the 1930s might not know how to operate an iPod but could still figure out how to use the twenty-first-century T-shirt . // But speaking of music : Band logos stood out as one popular strategy for adding value to a commodity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more companies offered T-shirts for the Clash , Slayer , Iron Maiden , Afrika Bambaataa , Melle Mel , and a seemingly endless variety of others , from the well-known to the obscure . At least three companies were selling rock T-shirts for toddlers-two had Ramones offerings . Maybe the bands who turned CBGB into the birthplace of American punk did not sell branded merch at the time , but thirty years later , Ramones T-shirts have outsold Ramones albums ten to one . And CB 's itself had a sizable Magic booth ; in fact , its clothing line grossed $2 million in 2004 , double the revenue of the actual music club , which later shut down . // Of course , music-related T-shirts were only one category . A sizable percentage of the apparel on sale at Magic really exists solely as a carrier for symbolic meanings developed elsewhere in the marketplace . Playboy had a huge display of its branded apparel , and Hustler was there , too . American Chopper , the television show , had a big space , as did Fender guitars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , live events , and DJs . Lowrider , as far as I knew , was just some specialty publication for fanatics of a particular style of car , but now sold apparel as well . // Kung Fu Inc. had shirts promoting the scabrous antiauthority clip-art comic Get Your War On and the indie-chick pornography brand SuicideGirls . Old Varsity sold college-wear . An endless number of television shows and movie properties were represented , from Adult Swim to ESPN to The Redneck Comedy Hour . One of the biggest booths was stuffed with T-shirts and other apparel carrying the symbol of John Deere , the maker of heavy farm equipment . Then there was X-Lab , distributor of shirts that say things like " Fuck the Fucking Fucks . " Now that 's purple . // Finally , there were T-shirts that simply advertised consumer products . Coastal Concepts had Burger King and Reese 's Cup shirts . Logotel had shirts for Kellogg 's , Hostess , M&amp;M 's . There were Moon Pie shirts . Others had Ford , Dodge , and Chevy shirts . And if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts for 7UP , Mountain Dew , RC , Dr Pepper , A&amp;W root beer , Miller High Life , Corona , Guinness , Budweiser , even Hamm 's and Mickey 's . A company called Brew City offered up the " subversive " versions that assumed brand literacy in order to mock it , by way of emblems like Schitt , in the style of the Schlitz logo . // Eventually , I turned a corner and was confronted with the Che booth . Here , in a fairly large and lavish display , a company called Fashion Victim was peddling to interested retailers a huge array of shirts , banners , and other items featuring the iconic image of Che Guevara . It also offered Lenin shirts , Mao shirts , Pancho Villa , Emiliano Zapata , and Geronimo shirts . Fashion Victim 's website explained : " Join the revolution with us here at Fashion Victim ! These are revolutionary times , so where better to get the gear you need . We have all the latest designs in the world of propaganda and revolution , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts in the US of A.
