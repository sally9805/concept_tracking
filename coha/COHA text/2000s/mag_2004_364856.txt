Seeing the Social Network <P> Getting down to work is a very social matter . That 's because employees are much more likely to turn to one another for information than to any other source . But managers are often completely in the dark about the design of such social networks . When networks organize themselves , they can drain coordination , learning and performance . The solution , according to The Hidden Power of Social Networks : Understanding How Work Really Gets Done in Organizations , is to make the network visible . By studying workers ' interactions and not just the official chain of command , managers can spot such problems as " bottlenecks " ( in which one worker is overwhelmingly depended on by many people ) , " peripheral people " ( who are n't tapped often enough and tend to be much less satisfied in their jobs ) and " disconnects " ( which can be caused by something as simple as a group being split between two floors in the same building ) .

In a competitive market , that 's not a no-brainer.  --  By Matthew Forney/Beijing <P> The Myths of Offshoring <P> As the outcry over U.S. corporations ' hiring white-collar labor abroad grows ever louder , an expanding body of research and analysis suggests that a job gained overseas is n't necessarily a job lost at home . According to a study by Matthew Slaughter , an associate professor at Dartmouth 's Tuck School of Business , during the decade ending in 2001 , U.S. firms hired nearly 3 million workers abroad , up 42% . At the same time , companies also expanded their U.S. work forces by almost 5.5 million , or 31% .
