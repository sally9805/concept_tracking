When it comes to losing weight , eating sensibly is only half the story . The other half ? Exercise . Yeah , we know : You just do n't have time to work out . But what if you had a flexible program , adjusted to fit your schedule ? We asked Joshua Margolis , a certified personal trainer and co-owner of the New York City fitness and nutrition consulting firm Mind Over Matter ( mindovernatternyc.com ) , to design a have-it-your-way workout that includes something for everyone . Just do one exercise from each category at least two or three days a week . The more you exercise , the quicker you 'll see results . You can do the cardio and flexibility exercises as often as you like , but with weight training you should never work out the same muscle group two days in a row . And check with your doctor before beginning any exercise program .

When you 're in tip-top shape , try jumping for 20 minutes . alternating one minute of jumping with one minute of rest . If you feel winded at any level , move from side to side like a fighter shadowboxing for the remainder of your jumping minutes . walking Walk for 20 to 30 minutes at a pace that allows you to cover one and a half to two miles . Beginners should walk for 10 to 15 minutes and work their way up to 30 minutes . running Once you can easily walk one and a half to two miles in 30 minutes , try walking for 10 minutes and running for 5 , until you progress to covering a two-mile distance by alternating walking and running a half mile .
