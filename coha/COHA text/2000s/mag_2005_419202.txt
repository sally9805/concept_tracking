A cadre of amateur astronomers has culled hundreds of small comets from the pictures taken by a spacecraft that stares at the Sun . Photograph // FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS , astronomers have known that some comets pass extremely close to the Sun . Historically , these visitors to the inner solar system provided a dazzling sight - brilliant , with long , narrow tails visible even in twilight . A few have been easily seen in full daylight . Some did n't survive , as gravitational stress and enormous heat shattered them as they ventured too near our star . In the late 19th century , German astronomer Heinrich Kreutz studied a subset of these comets and concluded that at least four , and possibly as many as eight - including the Great Comets of 1843 and 1882 - travel in similar orbits that bring them within a mere solar radius ( 696,000 kilometers , or 433,000 miles ) of the Sun 's photosphere at perihelion . Kreutz believed that these " sungrazing " comets , which form the group that now bears his name , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some earlier perihelion passage , as the 1882 comet ( C/1882 Rl ) was itself observed to do . Kreutz drew attention to the possibility that the 1882 comet - which when closest to the Sun shone brighter than magnitude - 15 with a 3 tail ! - was a return of another daylight comet seen in AD 1106 . In the mid-20th century , astronomers found four more Kreutz sungrazers , including 1965 's spectacular Ikeya-Seki ( C/1965 S1 ) . // SCORCHING PATHS The Great Comets of 1843 and 1882 may have been part of the same body that split perhaps two millennia ago . Photograph DAYLIGHT SPECTACLE The Great Comet of 1843 , also called the Great March Comet , was seen by many observers in broad daylight within a few days after it grazed the Sun on February 27th . This engraving depicts the comet above Paris on March 19th . A COMET TO REMEMBER Another Great Comet stunned skygazers late in 1882 . It was visible in the morning sky before and well after its September 17th perihelion . In October of that year , astronomers watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrophotograph was taken by David Gill on November 14th . MORNING GLORY The most spectacular sungrazing comet of modern times was Ikeya-Seki , which graced the predawn sky in late September I and October 1965 . Its orbit is very similar to that of the Great Comet of 1882 . Both are members of the same family of comets first theorized by 19th-century astronomer Heinrich Kreutz. // Kreutz Family Values The year after Ikeya-Seki 's appearance , cornet researchers Ichiro Hasegawa , Lubor Kresk , and one of us ( Brian Marsden ) each recognized that the Kreutz family consists of two distinct lineages . The orbital parameters of the groups ' members are similar , but the lines of nodes , where an orbit crosses Earth 's orbital plane , can be divided into two sets about 20 apart . So-called Subgroup I comets - the Great Comet of 1843 ( C/1843 Dl ) being the most prominent - approach to within a half solar radius of the Sun 's surface at perihelion . Subgroup II comets have slightly greater ( though still scorching ) perihelion distances . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subgroups , Marsden demonstrated that the two most prominent known Subgroup II comets - Ikeya-Seki and the Great Comet of 1882 - must have split from each other around the time of their previous perihelion , early in the 12th century , their common parent perhaps being the 1106 comet . Recently , in further modeling of the orbits of the 1882 and 1965 sungrazers , Jet Propulsion Laboratory researchers Zdenek Sekanina and Paul Chodas concluded that the split occurred about 18 days after perihelion . They added that the breakup of the primordial comet that created the two subgroups , believed to be about 120 km in diameter , must have been at least one revolution earlier . There has also been speculation - but scant evidence - that a brilliant comet seen in 372 BC , which the Greek philosopher Ephorus claimed to have seen tear in two , was perhaps the progenitor of the entire Kreutz system . Enter SOHO An unlikely comet-hunting tool has become key in advancing the understanding of sungrazers . When the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) spacecraft was launched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would reveal . SOHO , a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency , is in a " halo orbit " 1.5 million km sunward of Earth , near the Lsub 1 Lagrangian point . This permits essentially continuous viewing of the solar environment with the spacecraft 's dozen instruments . // STARING AT THE SUN The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) travels around the Sun in lockstep with Earth . The satellite swings around in a " halo orbit " about the Lsub 1 Lagrangian point , 1.5 million kilometers sunward from Earth , a vantage in which the Sun is always in view . Photograph TAIL BLAZER Operators of the SOHO spacecraft discovered that the satellite 's cameras could detect comets invisible to ground-based observers . The first examples , such as C/1996 Y1 ( SOHO 6 ) shown here , were obvious . But many of the satellite 's years-old archived images contained much fainter comets that have been discovered only recently . // Although earlier solar-science missions - Solwind and the Solar Maximum Mission - found 16 comets between 1979 and 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 2005 , the SOHO team had confirmed 967 comets , 949 of which had been officially announced . About 85 percent of them belong to the Kreutz group . All but five of SOHO 's comets have been found with its Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph ( LASCO ) telescopes , either its narrow-field ( C2 ) or wide-field ( C3 ) camera . ( A coronagraph uses an occulting disk to create an artificial eclipse , revealing the corona and objects hidden in the solar glare . ) C2 's field of view extends from about 2 to 6 solar radii , while C3 's runs from about 4 to 32 solar radii . The first SOHO comets were discovered , often serendipitously , by the project 's own scientists and ground controllers , but it took an amateur astronomer - Michael Oates of Manchester , England - to turn the finding of SOHO comets into a science ( S &T:; October 2000 , page 89 ) . In August 1999 , soon after Australian Terry Lovejoy became the first amateur to find a comet in the spacecraft 's images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : //sohowww.nascom . nasa.gov ) , SOHO project scientist Douglas A. Biesecker gave a talk on the satellite 's comet-finding abilities at the International Workshop on Cometary Astronomy in Cambridge , England . He inspired five participants to find their own SOHO comets , including conference host Jonathan Shanklin , the British Astronomical Association 's Comet Section director , who then encouraged Oates to start his own search . Oates soon realized that more SOHO comets were being found in the real-time images than in previous years . " This made me wonder if the searches in the past were not as thorough , " he recalls . // GOING , GOING , GONE C/1998 H2 ( SOHO 48 ) , a Kreutz sungrazer that completely evaporated , was detected on April 30 , 1998 . This series of images spans about five hours . // Sungrazer Seasons Oates then systematically searched the archived images from SOHO 's early years , looking for objects that followed a path typical of a Kreutz comet . This proved a most effective strategy ; within 10 months he had found his 100th SOHO comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : due to the relative geometry of the Earth , the Sun , and the Kreutz stream , " comet storms " - in which a comet is found every two days or so in C2 camera images - occur twice a year , from April to June and from October to December . During these periods the comets peak in brightness within C2 's narrow field , while the rest of the year - when the comets travel more nearly perpendicular to the EarthSun line - most vaporize before they can enter the instrument 's field of view . Assuming that the " storm " rate is close to the true average pace of detectable fragments and that the average orbital period of a sungrazer is 800 years , Sekanina has estimated that about 200,000 of these mini-comets orbit the Sun . Calling them comets is generous ; the nuclei can be as small as 5 meters ( 16 feet ) in diameter . Biesecker considers them intermediate between small comets and meteor-shower debris . Even the largest , perhaps 50 to 100 meters across , have not survived perihelion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 22 , 2003 , persisted briefly after perihelion ) . Sekanina has estimated that it would take a fragment with an initial diameter of at least 1 km to do so . He has also noted that the peak brightness of a fragment directly correlates with its initial mass ; the combined mass of all the small Kreutz fragments orbiting the Sun is insignificant compared to the mass of the largest known Kreutz comet nucleus , perhaps several tens of kilometers across . // SOLAR VISION The vast majority of the more than 900 comets discovered by the SOHO spacecraft were first detected by the satellite 's Lorge Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph ( LASCO ) . Its C2 and C3 telescopes use occulting disks to block the Sun 's glare ( size of the Sun is represented by the white circle ) . These images from the C2 telescope have a narrower field of view than C3 , as shown on the following page . The insets reveal the movement of C/2004 G5 ( SOHO 755 ) , a Kreutz comet discovered by author Tony Huffman . The uncometlike speck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 percent of SOHO finds are related to the spectacular comets illustrated on page 33. // Light curves show that Kreutz comets imaged by C3 tend to peak in brightness around 12 solar radii from the Sun . Hiroshi Kimura ( Westfalische Wilhelms University , Germany ) and his colleagues have noted that this is the distance at which the silicate mineral olivine sublimates , and that a moderation in the decrease of the comets ' brightness within 7 solar radii of the Sun may be due to the sublimation of another silicate , pyroxene. // LOOKING WIDER The C3 telescope aboard SOHO shows more sky around the Sun than the C2 instrument . This view from October 10 , 2004 , contains three comets , including Kreutz comet C/2004 T5 ( SOHO 841 ) , discovered by Rainer Kracht. // The comets ' dust tails are likely made of tiny grains of crystalline silicates . Biesecker suggests that the relative brightness of Kreutz comets seen by C2 is due to sodium emission . He describes the light curves of comets that are less than 7 solar radii from our star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of large but unresolved fragments with relatively low erosion rates . Many Kreutz pairs , triplets , and at least one quadruple comet have been seen on SOHO images , their components appearing within hours of each other and traveling on slightly different trajectories . Sekanina , who has studied how Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 and others have split apart , has concluded that the events that create these multiple nuclei often occur far from the Sun , even around aphelion . He sees the evolution of the Kreutz group as a cascading series of fragmentations in which a comet must have split several times during the course of a single revolution around the Sun into progressively smaller pieces . So far , only one comet discovered in LASCO images has become visible to other ground-based observers . In May 1998 a " sporadic " ( non-group ) comet appeared bright and with a tail in C3 images . Within a couple of weeks , C/1998 Jl ( SOHO 49 ) * became well placed for Southern Hemisphere observers and shone at 4th magnitude - but they had trouble locating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; astronomers derived coordinates by measuring position angles and distances from the Sun . C/1998 J1 's track along the edge of the C3 field - where distortion is greatest - was problematic . The situation inspired a crash effort to improve the astrometry , and Marsden reworked the older orbits . SOHO-based astrometry now is much more reliable . New Groups , New Insights Prior to SOHO , the Kreutz group with some 80 percent of its members belonging to Subgroup I ) was the only known comet group . Three new groups of near-Sun comets have since been identified , two of them by German amateurs . In January 2002 , Maik Meyer - who manages the Catalogue of Comet Discoveries Web site ( www.comethunter.de ) and has found 37 SOHO comets - noted that a newly discovered non-Kreutz SOHO comet and one found four years earlier had similar orbits . He recalculated the orbits of other unclassified SOHO comets and found four more . There are now more than 50 known objects in the Meyer group . They have highly inclined orbits ( about 71 ) , likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get as close as about 4 million km to the Sun . Marsden was aware of another related pair , whose members reached perihelion 4 months apart . He reworked the orbits of other sporadic SOHO comets and identified a second group . Soon Rainer Kracht , a German schoolteacher who has now discovered more than 150 comets , including SOHO 's 900th ( May issue , page 112 ) , identified a third group . The Kracht and Marsden groups are related , having a similar perihelion direction and distances ( about 6 million km ) ; they each have about 20 known members . Newgroup comets are relatively inactive - nearly all appear stellar , tailless , and faint . Unlike Kreutz comets , many survive perihelion . They seem to be as prone to fragmentation as Kreutz comets , however . Marsden and Kracht comets have often come in pairs or even clusters . ( In a three-day period in May 2004 , no fewer than six Kracht comets - a quarter of all known members of the group - were detected . ) Marsden-group orbits nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) passed within 4 million km of our world in June 1999 , a month after its perihelion . Unsettlingly , however , it remained undiscovered until Oates found it in the image archive in March 2000 . C/1999 J6 has another distinction . Marsden has concluded that C/2004 V9 ( SOHO 859 ) , found last November , is probably the same object as C/1999 J6 , which would give it a period of 5.49 years . ( If so , it would have passed just 1.3 million km from Earth on June 12 , 1999 , potentially the closest known cometary approach . ) He also showed it likely that another Marsden comet , C/2005 E4 ( SOHO 915 ) , was the return of C/1999 N5 ( SOHO 408 ) - with a period of 5.66 years - and suggests that it and C/1999 J6 and C/2004 V9 may have split from each other in 1993 . In addition , Marsden and Chodas have identified possible links between several Kracht comets , indicating a period of about 5 years for the group . This evidence for the short-period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Photograph BEST OF CLASS Few of SOHO 's comet finds ever become bright enough for amateur astronomers to observe . A notable exception was C/1998 J1 ( SOHO 49 ) , a sporadic comet not belonging to any known group , which brightened to 4th magnitude for Southern Hemisphere observers . // Australian comet hunter David Seargent noted similarities between the Marsden group and the Daytime Arietids , a meteor shower that peaks on June 8th . Japanese meteor observer Katsuhito Ohtsuka and his colleagues have further linked the Marsden and Kracht groups , Comet 96P/Machholz whose period is 5.2 years ) , and the Daytime Arietids . They propose that the Marsden and Kracht groups are fragments that separated from Comet Machholz about 4,000 years ago , when that comet 's perihelion distance was near its minimum . ( Its orbit varies over an 8,000-year cycle . ) The Quadrantid and Delta Aquarid meteor showers may also be involved . It 's possible that additional , less populous groups remain to be found . At least one related triplet ( dubbed Kracht II ) and another related pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comet Program SOHO is in the ninth year of what was initially a two-year mission , having survived power problems , gyroscope failures , and antenna troubles . The mission has been extended until 2007 , by which time the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory ( STEREO ) spacecraft should be in orbit and the Solar Dynamics Observatory close to launch . SOHO 's comet program has itself proven resilient . // ALL IN THE FAMILY By sifting through the orbital parameters of hundreds of SOHO comets , astronomers have found other families that are likely the remnants of larger comets shattered long ago . Kreutz , Meyer , and the proposed Kracht Il groups are all distinct . But Marsden and Kracht I comets may be related to Comet 96P/Machholz , which has a period of 5.2 years . The orbits of most SOHO comets are significantly uncertain because such sungrazers are usually seen for only a couple of days at most with an instrument that was n't intended to provide high-precision astrometry. // In late 2002 , staff attrition led to stagnation in handling SOHO data , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project no longer employed a person to process comet claims or handle astrometry . Many of the regular hunters , believing that their discoveries might never be confirmed , stopped searching . Fortunately , though , word of the demise of SOHO 's comet program proved premature . In late 2003 , Karl Battams was hired by the US Naval Research Laboratory , which designed the LASCO coronagraphs , to confirm and measure SOHO comets , among other responsibilities . Catherine McGleam ( University of Maryland ) collaborated with him on astrometry , and within a few months the backlogs in both comet claims and astrometry were eliminated . Thanks to the tireless efforts of amateurs like Lovejoy , Oates , Meyer , and Kracht , SOHO has helped researchers to understand not only the history and dynamics of the Kreutz system but also the behavior of comets under extreme conditions and the evolution and disintegration of comets in general .
