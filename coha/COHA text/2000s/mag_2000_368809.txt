OCCUPATION Co-founder and CEO of RedFilter , an Internet start-up <P> GOAL To make browsing the Web more like browsing TV with a remote <P> QUOTE " Anyone who tells you they 're not doing it for the money , anyone who hints the payoff is n't important  --  they 're lying . " <P> The NASDAQ crash may have left New York City 's Silicon Alley a boulevard of broken dreams , but William O'Shea , 24 , is one dotcom entrepreneur who has n't been discouraged . O'Shea and two friends came up with the idea for their new company , RedFilter , last year in his Brooklyn apartment . O'Shea calls it " a remote control for the Internet " : go to RedFilter 's website , enter your age , pick the subjects you 're interested in , and RedFilter spits back a series of sites custom-picked for your tastes . RedFilter 's survival secret : it sells its filter technology to other websites so they can adapt it for their own users . " Our focus was always on profitability , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age to be running your own company , when you have the stamina , " says O'Shea , who usually works 13 hours a day . " Maybe when I 'm 40 I 'll get a chance to rest . " A native of the New Jersey suburbs who majored in social studies at Wesleyan University , he was inspired by his father , a florist who " worked seven days a week until I was 15 . " This is O'Shea 's first gig as a businessman ; he still speaks like the cautious , probing technology journalist he once was . Maybe that 's the key to winning investors : talk softly and carry a big idea . Or maybe it 's just old-economy work ethic . <P>  --  By Benjamin Nugent
