Chapter One Anna When I was little , the great mystery to me was n't how babies were made , but why . The mechanics I understood - my older brother Jesse had filled me in - although at the time I was sure he 'd heard half of it wrong . Other kids my age were busy looking up the words penis and vagina in the classroom dictionary when the teacher had her back turned , but I paid attention to different details . Like why some mothers only had one child , while other families seemed to multiply before your eyes . Or how the new girl in school , Sedona , told anyone who 'd listen that she was named for the place where her parents were vacationing when they made her ( " Good thing they were n't staying in Jersey City , " my father used to say ) . Now that I am thirteen , these distinctions are only more complicated : the eighth-grader who dropped out of school because she got into trouble ; a neighbor who got herself pregnant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce . I 'm telling you , if aliens landed on earth today and took a good hard look at why babies get born , they 'd conclude that most people have children by accident , or because they drink too much on a certain night , or because birth control is n't one hundred percent , or for a thousand other reasons that really are n't very flattering . On the other hand , I was born for a very specific purpose . I was n't the result of a cheap bottle of wine or a full moon or the heat of the moment . I was born because a scientist managed to hook up my mother 's eggs and my father 's sperm to create a specific combination of precious genetic material . In fact , when Jesse told me how babies get made and I , the great disbeliever , decided to ask my parents the truth , I got more than I bargained for . They sat me down and told me all the usual stuff , of course - but they also explained that they chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister , Kate . " We loved you even more , " my mother made sure to say , " because we knew what exactly we were getting . " It made me wonder , though , what would have happened if Kate had been healthy . Chances are , I 'd still be floating up in Heaven or wherever , waiting to be attached to a body to spend some time on Earth . Certainly I would not be part of this family . See , unlike the rest of the free world , I did n't get here by accident . And if your parents have you for a reason , then that reason better exist . Because once it 's gone , so are you . Pawnshops may be full of junk , but they 're also a breeding ground for stories , if you ask me , not that you did . What happened to make a person trade in the Never Before Worn Diamond Solitaire ? Who needed money so badly they 'd sell a teddy bear missing an eye ? As I walk up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the locket I 'm about to give up , and ask these same questions . The man at the cash register has a nose the shape of a turnip , and eyes sunk so deep I ca n't imagine how he sees well enough to go about his business . " Need something ? " he asks . It 's all I can do to not turn around and walk out the door , pretend I 've come in by mistake . The only thing that keeps me steady is knowing I am not the first person to stand in front of this counter holding the one item in the world I never thought I 'd part with . " I have something to sell , " I tell him . " Am I supposed to guess what it is ? " " Oh . " Swallowing , I pull the locket out of the pocket of my jeans . The heart falls on the glass counter in a pool of its own chain . " It 's fourteen-karat gold , " I pitch . " Hardly ever worn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't taken it off in seven years . My father gave it to me when I was six after the bone marrow harvest , because he said anyone who was giving her sister such a major present deserved one of her own . Seeing it there , on the counter , my neck feels shivery and naked . The owner puts a loop up to his eye , which makes it seem almost normal size . " I 'll give you twenty . " " Dollars ? " " No , pesos . What did you think ? " " It 's worth five times that ! " I 'm guessing . The owner shrugs . " I 'm not the one who needs the money . " I pick up the locket , resigned to sealing the deal , and the strangest thing happens - my hand , it just clamps shut like the Jaws of Life . My face goes red with the effort to peel apart my fingers . It takes what seems like an hour for that locket to spill into the owner 's outstretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " Tell them you lost it , " he offers , advice tossed in for free . If Mr. Webster had decided to put the word freak in his dictionary , Anna Fitzgerald would be the best definition he could give . It 's more than just the way I look : refugee-skinny with absolutely no chest to speak of , hair the color of dirt , connect-the-dot freckles on my cheeks that , let me tell you , do not fade with lemon juice or sunscreen or even , sadly , sandpaper . No , God was obviously in some kind of mood on my birthday , because he added to this fabulous physical combination the bigger picture - the household into which I was born . My parents tried to make things normal , but that 's a relative term . The truth is , I was never really a kid . To be honest , neither were Kate and Jesse . I guess maybe my brother had his moment in the sun for the four years he was alive before Kate got diagnosed , but ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our shoulders to run headlong into growing up . You know how most little kids think they 're like cartoon characters - if an anvil drops on their heads they can peel themselves off the sidewalk and keep going ? Well , I never once believed that . How could I , when we practically set a place for Death at the dinner table ? Kate has acute promyelocytic leukemia . Actually , that 's not quite true - right now she does n't have it , but it 's hibernating under her skin like a bear , until it decides to roar again . She was diagnosed when she was two ; she 's sixteen now . Molecular relapse and granulocyte and portacath - these words are part of my vocabulary , even though I 'll never find them on any SAT . I 'm an allogeneic donor - a perfect sibling match . When Kate needs leukocytes or stem cells or bone marrow to fool her body into thinking it 's healthy , I 'm the one who provides them . Nearly every time Kate 's hospitalized , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , except that you should n't believe what you hear about me , least of all that which I tell you myself . As I am coming up the stairs , my mother comes out of her room wearing another ball gown . " Ah , " she says , turning her back to me . " Just the girl I wanted to see . " I zip it up and watch her twirl . My mother could be beautiful , if she were parachuted into someone else 's life . She has long dark hair and the fine collarbones of a princess , but the corners of her mouth turn down , like she 's swallowed bitter news . She does n't have much free time , since a calendar is something that can change drastically if my sister develops a bruise or a nosebleed , but what she does have she spends at Bluefly.com , ordering ridiculously fancy evening dresses for places she is never going to go . " What do you think ? " she asks . The gown is all the colors of a sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves . It 's strapless , what a star might wear sashaying down a red carpet - totally not the dress code for a suburban house in Upper Darby , RI . My mother twists her hair into a knot and holds it in place . On her bed are three other dresses - one slinky and black , one bugle-beaded , one that seems impossibly small . " You look ... " Tired . The word bubbles right under my lips . My mother goes perfectly still , and I wonder if I 've said it without meaning to . She holds up a hand , shushing me , her ear cocked to the open doorway . " Did you hear that ? " " Hear what ? " " Kate . " " I did n't hear anything . " But she does n't take my word for it , because when it comes to Kate she does n't take anybody 's word for it . She marches upstairs and opens up our bedroom door to find my sister hysterical on her bed , and just like that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has tried to explain black holes to me , how they are so heavy they absorb everything , even light , right into their center . Moments like this are the same kind of vacuum ; no matter what you cling to , you wind up being sucked in . " Kate ! " My mother sinks down to the floor , that stupid skirt a cloud around her . " Kate , honey , what hurts ? " Kate hugs a pillow to her stomach , and tears keep streaming down her face . Her pale hair is stuck to her face in damp streaks ; her breathing 's too tight . I stand frozen in the doorway of my own room , waiting for instructions : Call Daddy . Call 911 . Call Dr. Chance . My mother goes so far as to shake a better explanation out of Kate . " It 's Preston , " she sobs . " He 's leaving Serena for good . " That 's when we notice the TV . On the screen , a blond hottie gives a longing look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then he slams the door . " But what hurts ? " my mother asks , certain there has to be more to it than this . " Oh my God , " Kate says , sniffling . " Do you have any idea how much Serena and Preston have been through ? Do you ? " That fist inside me relaxes , now that I know it 's all right . Normal , in our house , is like a blanket too short for a bed - sometimes it covers you just fine , and other times it leaves you cold and shaking ; and worst of all , you never know which of the two it 's going to be . I sit down on the end of Kate 's bed . Although I 'm only thirteen , I 'm taller than her and every now and then people mistakenly assume I 'm the older sister . At different times this summer she has been crazy for Callahan , Wyatt , and Liam , the male leads on this soap . Now , I guess , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare , " I volunteer . I actually followed that story line ; Kate made me tape the show during her dialysis sessions . " And the time she almost married his twin by mistake , " Kate adds . " Do n't forget when he died in the boat accident . For two months , anyway . " My mother joins the conversation , and I remember that she used to watch this soap , too , sitting with Kate in the hospital . For the first time , Kate seems to notice my mother 's outfit . " What are you wearing ? " " Oh . Something I 'm sending back . " She stands up in front of me so that I can undo her zipper . This mail-order compulsion , for any other mother , would be a wake-up call for therapy ; for my mom , it would probably be considered a healthy break . I wonder if it 's putting on someone else 's skin for a while that she likes so much , or if it 's the option of being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looks at Kate , hard . " You 're sure nothing hurts ? " After my mother leaves , Kate sinks a little . That 's the only way to describe it - how fast color drains from her face , how she disappears against the pillows . As she gets sicker , she fades a little more , until I am afraid one day I will wake up and not be able to see her at all . " Move , " Kate orders . " You 're blocking the picture . " So I go to sit on my own bed . " It 's only the coming attractions . " " Well , if I die tonight I want to know what I 'm missing . " I fluff my pillows up under my head . Kate , as usual , has swapped so that she has all the funchy ones that do n't feel like rocks under your neck . She 's supposed to deserve this , because she 's three years older than me or because she 's sick or because the moon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squint at the television , wishing I could flip through the stations , knowing I do n't have a prayer . " Preston looks like he 's made out of plastic . " " Then why did I hear you whispering his name last night into your pillow ? " " Shut up , " I say . " You shut up . " Then Kate smiles at me . " He probably is gay , though . Quite a waste , considering the Fitzgerald sisters are - " Wincing , she breaks off mid-sentence , and I roll toward her . " Kate ? " She rubs her lower back . " It 's nothing . " It 's her kidneys . " Want me to get Mom ? " " Not yet . " She reaches between our beds , which are just far apart enough for us to touch each other if we both try . I hold out my hand , too . When we were little we 'd make this bridge and try to see how many Barbies we could get to balance on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm cut into so many pieces that there is n't enough of me to be put back together . My father says that a fire will burn itself out , unless you open a window and give it fuel . I suppose that 's what I 'm doing , when you get right down to it ; but then again , my dad also says that when flames are licking at your heels you 've got to break a wall or two if you want to escape . So when Kate falls asleep from her meds I take the leather binder I keep between my mattress and box spring and go into the bathroom for privacy . I know Kate 's been snooping - I rigged up a red thread between the zipper 's teeth to let me know who was prying into my stuff without my permission , but even though the thread 's been torn there 's nothing missing inside . I turn on the water in the bathtub so it sounds like I 'm in there for a reason , and sit down on the floor to count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawnshop , I have $136.87 . It 's not going to be enough , but there 's got to be a way around that . Jesse did n't have $2,900 when he bought his beat-up Jeep , and the bank gave him some kind of loan . Of course , my parents had to sign the papers , too , and I doubt they 're going to be willing to do that for me , given the circumstances . I count the money a second time , just in case the bills have miraculously reproduced , but math is math and the total stays the same . And then I read the newspaper clippings . Campbell Alexander . It 's a stupid name , in my opinion . It sounds like a bar drink that costs too much , or a brokerage firm . But you ca n't deny the man 's track record . To reach my brother 's room , you actually have to leave the house , which is exactly the way he likes it . When Jesse turned sixteen he moved into the attic over the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents to see what he was doing and my parents did n't really want to see . Blocking the stairs to his place are four snow tires , a small wall of cartons , and an oak desk tipped onto its side . Sometimes I think Jesse sets up these obstacles himself , just to make getting to him more of a challenge . I crawl over the mess and up the stairs , which vibrate with the bass from Jesse 's stereo . It takes nearly five whole minutes before he hears me knocking . " What ? " he snaps , opening the door a crack . " Can I come in ? " He thinks twice , then steps back to let me enter . Continues ...
