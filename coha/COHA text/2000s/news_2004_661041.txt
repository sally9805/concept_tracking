<p> In the past week , car bombings and other insurgent attacks against US and Iraqi forces have returned to pre-June 28 handover levels . But kidnapping , too , is emerging as one of the most effective weapons for eroding confidence in the interim Iraqi government and slowing reconstruction . <p> The low-cost and low-risk tactic is being used to barter lives for political goals . <p> Such blackmail has already driven the Philippines and a number of private contractors , including Russian and Turkish firms , from the country . It is also driving up security and insurance costs for companies doing everything from fixing Iraq 's sewers to providing mail service to US troops , leaving far less money for the infra- structure improvements that Iraq so desperately needs . <p> " People here are demanding improvements in basic services , water , and electricity , not to mention jobs , " says Wamidh Nadhmi , a political science professor at Baghdad University . " They 're not seeing any improvements , so the prospects for instability and violence go up . " <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor its Iraqi partners have been able to break . <p> Carefully targeted violence disrupts contracting work , slowing the pace of reconstruction and driving up costs . As the restoration of basic services like power and water is stalled , the pool of dissatisfied Iraqis willing to participate in the insurgency grows . <p> " These tactics to me point to a machine that not only knows Iraqi society and when and where to strike , but to people who have a political objective - and part and parcel of their objective is stopping development work , " says Isam al-Khafaji , director of Iraq Revenue Watch , which tracks US spending here . " This is why so little has been spent . So far , they 're winning . " <p> Mr. Khafaji says increasing insurgent activity in towns like Ramadi , Samara , and Baqubah , - all in the Sunni triangle - are signs that the " get tough " approach promised by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi may be backfiring . <p> Violence against contractors and government officials has been rising since last year , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines ' decision to withdraw its 50-man military contingent from Iraq to save the life of Filipino trucker Angelo de la Cruz , who was released last Tuesday . <p> Since then , at least 13 new hostages have been taken , including the head of an Iraqi government construction company , two Jordanian truck drivers , an Egyptian diplomat , and eight foreign contractors . <p> On Friday , Mohammed Qutb , the third-highest official at the Egyptian Embassy in Baghdad , was kidnapped in Baghdad by a group calling itself the " Lions of God Battalion " while leaving a mosque after evening prayers . This occurred as Mr. Allawi embarked on a trip in which he has urged Egypt and other Arab states to contribute troops to the Iraq effort . <p> Mr. Qutb had led hostage negotiations earlier this month that led to the release of an Egyptian truck driver in exchange for a pledge from his Saudi employer to leave Iraq , and pictures of him greeting the freed hostage were widely printed in Iraq . <p> " There is no way to budge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sunday in Damascus , Syria , the AP reported . " The only way to deal with terrorism is to promote justice and to close ranks , and we hope Egypt and the Egyptian government will act accordingly . " Egypt has promised it will not send troops to Iraq . <p> Last week , three Kenyans , three Indians , and an Egyptian working as truck drivers for Kuwait and Gulf Link Transport , were taken hostage by a group calling itself the " Holders of the Black Banners , " which in videotaped statement threatened to behead one hostage every 72 hours - with the first victim to be killed Monday evening - if the company did n't pull out of Iraq . <p> On Monday , the group said it was delaying its murder plans to give negotiations more time . The company says it is committed to bringing the men to safety but has n't promised to pull out yet . <p> The kidnappings are almost always done by what seems to be a new group . The murderers of US businessman Nick Berg called themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be controlled by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab Zarqawi , who US officials claim has been behind much of the violence here . But US officials say it is n't clear whether the kidnappers are in different organizations , or if the same people use different names . <p> Jihad websites with links to Al Qaeda urge insurgents to use a host of different and confusing group names when announcing their activities , both to make the movement seem larger and to make them harder to catch . <p> The Philippines was caught up in wave of domestic revulsion at the kidnapping , since many citizens know someone who could be Angelo de la Cruz . The English-speaking Philippines has more than 7 million workers abroad , leading President Gloria Arroyo to describe him as the country 's " everyman . " <p> But the decision to bend to his kidnappers ' demands , and similar withdrawals by foreign companies terrorized by militants here , clearly demonstrated to the insurgents the advantages of hostage taking in a chaotic environment like Iraq 's . <p> Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq , sharply criticized the Philippines in a Sunday interview with an Australian television station . " You have to stand up to these people , because if you do n't , you empower them , " he said . <p> The risks have clearly been surging for private contractors . So far in 2004 , at least 86 private contractors from 18 different countries have been killed by insurgents in Iraq , compared to at least 16 killed last year . <p> Over the weekend , the decapitated body of a Bulgarian truck driver kidnapped recently was pulled from a river here , and officials said a second Bulgarian kidnapped with him was also probably dead . <p> Foreign workers are n't likely to pull out of Iraq entirely . As shown by the broad number of nationalities killed in private jobs here - far broader than the US-led coalition - thousands have been and will continue to be lured by lucrative job opportunities , despite the danger . <p> While hiring more Iraqis for jobs like truck driving might seem to be a solution , some Iraqi drivers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck drivers kidnapped and executed in Fallujah last month . <p> Monday , gunmen also opened fire on five women who work as cleaners for US firm Bechtel in the southern city of Basra , killing two and wounding two others , one survivor said . The women were waiting for a bus to take them to work when they were attacked . <p> Another problem for contractors , analysts say , is they 're not certain which Iraqis to trust , worried that they might hire someone who will feed information to insurgents and make their operations more vulnerable . <p> But a US official estimates that about 20 percent of US reconstruction spending here now goes to private security - meaning much less money to be spent on laying water pipes and dredging sewage canals . In difficult operating environments like Nigeria and Sudan , oil companies typically spend about 5 to 8 percent of costs on security . <p> To critics of the interim government , the latest kidnappings are symptomatic of Allawi 's lack of legitimacy , and they worry that violence will only get worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes that elections in January are already looking unlikely , unless things turn around fast . <p> " What we have is people who do n't have deep roots here trying to engage a deeply fragmented society , " says Nadhmi , a critic of the process that brought Allawi to power . " He 's seen as coming to power supported by US tanks , and that 's going to make it very difficult for him . " <p> * Material from wire services was used in this story . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
