1 . CASTLE GARDEN " Hot corn , get your hot corn ! " Her voice cut through the clamor of Broadway but attracted no customers as she made her way south through the teeming crowd , bouncing her basket on her hip . When she reached the gates of the old fort known as Castle Garden , where the immigration center was , she flashed a smile at the guard , entered the premises and quickly sold her corn , several dozen ears , to the usual cast of hollow-cheeked immigrants . The stuff had been dried on the cob in the fall and had to be soaked two full days before boiling , but even so , it had tasted good to her , five years back , after the unrelenting porridge of the passage from Dublin . Here and there , ears that had been stripped clean lay discarded in the dirt , kicked up against the pillars , along with every other sort of garbage . So she 'd sold her corn , but it did n't earn her much , just pennies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't why she 'd come . Hot-corn girls were notorious for rounding out their incomes by stepping into corners and lifting their skirts upon request , but that was n't the sort of compromise Beatrice had chosen to make . She 'd found another way to save up the money to bring her younger brother over , and to keep her dignity , too . " That was fine , miss , " said a boy , politely swallowing a belch . " Have you got any more ? " He was just about her brother 's age . Her voice had sounded that Irish when she had first arrived . Now it was more flexible ; she could show her brogue or not , depending on the situation . She let her voice lilt just enough to tell him he was at home there , too , but her answer was no , and she did n't crack asmile . She had too much to do to linger with him . She and her friend Fiona generally hit the disembarking passengers together . They were good , the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the rest of the girls in the gang put together , not least because they had fun doing it . They 'd never been arrested , not even once . The jobs they pulled brought in plenty of money , but half the take went to their boss , just for starters , and then they split the rest between them . It was better than piecework , but it was taking too long for her to save up enough for Padric 's ticket . She worried about what would become of him if she did n't send for him soon . And so she had been pleased to learn that morning that Fiona was needed to help on another job , leaving Beatrice free to go out solo . A small lie or two when the gang did their weekly accounts would mean she could keep four times as much as on a usual day , bringing Padric over that much faster . The only problem was , it was also far more perilous , since it was n't just the cops she had to worry about , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he ever discovered she 'd kept his cut for herself . She took a sharp breath and stashed her basket behind a vast pile of luggage . The day was raw , and she was freezing . To do what she was going to do , she needed her hands to be warm and nimble . Her fingers fluttered in the dank harbor air , then vanished into her dress , leaving the sleeves of her overcoat dangling empty . Her hands darted past cheap gabardine and worn shirting and came to nestle in the heat , the musk , the fine damp hairs of her armpits . Soon her fingers were starting to feel warm . But her arms were trussed , and all she could do , when a gust of wind worked a copper strand loose from its braid and whipped it in her face , was snort and shake her head . Through it all , she watched the steamship 's tenders as they were loaded up with trunks , then passengers . The first-class passengers had long since gone through a genteel version of immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-appointed West Side terminal , not Castle Garden . Steerage would be last off , as usual . But a ship this size carried people of every level of wealth and class , and her targets , the second-class passengers , would be the first to disembark here . As the tender bumped against the pilings , Beatrice extracted her hands from her armpits , stuck them nonchalantly back through her sleeves into her pockets and began to move . Her eye followed the parade of ribboned hats and horn-handled canes that parted the crowds in the frigid brick rotunda . " As if there were n't enough of these people already , " said a woman in a high velvet toque with a nervous thrust of her chin at the crowds of steerage passengers from earlier ships . Her husband winced and nodded . They 'd just spent the season in London . Before the war , they had traveled first class and never had to set foot in Castle Garden , but most of her money was Southernwhich was to say diminished since the War Between the Statesand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hat , let down the braids that had been twisted under it and adjusted her posture and face in subtle ways that stripped her of nearly a decade in a handful of seconds : She was suddenly quite a little girl . The second-class couple emerged at the north gate , relieved , with sighs and murmurs of " Ah , New York , so good to be home ! " At the curb , while the coachman raised their trunks to his roof rack and the gentleman made to hand his lady up onto the tufted leather carriage bench , Beatrice pressed forward . With her hand outstretched , she said , " Welcome to America , sir , miss ! Have you anything extra to help me and my ailing mother ? " The couple looked awayhe to the side , his wife to him . That was the trick , of course : to force them to look away . Beatrice 's fingers were as fast as her eyes seemed innocent . Watches were her specialty , but this time she focused on the lady , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's long-gone gold-rimmed brooch . She was n't sure how good it was , how much it would bring , so she also grabbed the silk and suede wallet that protruded from the gentlewoman 's muff , which turned out to be bulging at the seams , though some of the currency was foreign . Then Beatrice was gone , and the couple was grateful . The horse left a loamy turd steaming on the pavement as it strained against its harness . The wheels ground forward . They were halfway home before they realized what they 'd lost , at which point Beatrice was just pushing through the swinging doors of Marm Mandelbaum 's pawnshop , wondering what price she 'd have to accept on the brooch in exchange for the old shrew 's discretion . 2 . INFERNO Asleep in the dark , with his limbs tucked up against his belly for warmth , he had made himself small , just a fetal lump in the middle of his narrow pallet . His blankets were topped by his overcoat , and he 'd tucked the whole pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . The floor of the tack room had been strewn with hay , the wall by the bed decorated with a couple of nails from which , on warmer nights , he might have hung his clothes . The horseshoe propped upright on a crossbeam above his head was a relic of a previous tenant 's superstitions . There was little in that room to suggest who he was , this stableman , except perhaps the worn cashmere and shredded silk lining of his coatit had been a fine garment , once . And on the narrow shelf made by another beam , a bowie knife and a few whittled figurines : a bear , a gorilla and a strange hybrid creature , like a griffin , but of his own imagining , composed of assorted parts of the exotic creatures he cared for . It was no ordinary stable where he worked . The horse stalls were inhabited not by hacks but by dancing white Arabians , and there were no cows at all , but an orangutan , a giraffe , a python , a tiger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so dreamlike , so uncanny . The job he had landed through the Labor Exchange was certainly not what he 'd imagined doing in America when he 'd left home . What he wanted to do was build cathedrals or , barring such glory , churches , houses , even roads . That was his training and , what with the constant stream of immigration to New York , he 'd been sure there would be work for a man with experience in the building trades . It had n't been so easy , though . So there he was at P. T. Barnum 's American Museum , shoveling dung and hay and whiling away his few bits of spare time carving figures from odd chunks of wood he found lying about . His other possessions included a second shirt , some extra socks , a sack of apples and a guidebook to New York with a picture postcard tucked between its pages , one side showing an elegant bath hall at Baden-Baden , the other a stamp , a postmark from a decade before , a name and address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the weather was fine , she was feeling much better and she would be home soon : the usual . Only the name above the address was notablefor its difference from the one by which the stableman was now known , on his documents and to his employers . He did n't worry about anyone putting that together , though . Sometimes even he was incredulous at the great distance that lay between his present self and that boy who had been missed by his mother at Baden . How far was it from Germany to New York ? He was n't exactly sure . It was n't a journey he 'd ever meant to take . Things had happened to him , and he 'd responded . Now he was here . Was he happy ? Not by a long shot . But not sad either . It was more that he was waiting for the next phase of his life to begin . In the meantime , his face and features were locked and shuttered like a shop at sundown , cinched tight like a burlap sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was awake , he was cautiously optimistiche 'd landed on his feet more than once before . While he slept , he snored . And all around him in the stable , buzzing flies joined the noise , awakened from their quasihibernation by a warmth premature for the season and puzzlingly at odds with the weather outdoors . That was the first alarm that something was amissa quiet one . The stableman was sleeping too deeply , dreaming too hard , to hear it . The clear screen of his cornea refracted the image of his optic nerve , and he saw backward into his own mind . The veins were like road maps leading to the time when he 'd had a family , friends , a proper home . But that night the subject of the magic-lantern show flashing through his brain was nearer to hand : a sightseeing jaunt he 'd taken on his last day off . He 'd been walking back from the Battery when he first saw the girl . She was an average young woman hawking corn from a basket . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry , even for one of those mushy lukewarm ears of corn . The stuff was sold on every street corner by hot-corn girls of every variety : black near Union Square and Irish at the Battery , German further north and east . Wherever he went in New York , there was always one of them singing the same song , but he 'd never heard it sung so nonchalantly , so appealingly . " Hot corn ! Get your hot corn ! Here 's your lily-white corn . " And so a woman was conjured into being while he slept , conceived from his memory of seeing Beatrice on the street and a certain strain in the position of his limbs . But then the pleasure of the dream was stymied by the same frustration he 'd felt that day at the crowded corner of Broadway and Maiden Lane . There she was , hawking her corn , but just when he 'd nearly caught her , she slipped away from him into the crowd . In his sleep , in the tack room , which was filling now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to taste her corn , if not to hold her , he wondered , at least in his dream ? Something had ignited within him , just as the building he slept in so soundly was going up in fire . Oh well , there will be other hot-corn girls , he thought , never guessing , asleep or awake , that the skirts of his fate swished around that very hot-corn girl 's ankles . She 'd disappeared on him , but the heat she brought on remained . At least he was no longer cold , he thought , middream . He was standing before a roaring fire , a marble mantelpiece , a gleaming brass fender . He was back home in Germany , a boy in his father 's parlor . His mother was serving tea . But no , he 'd gotten rid of his whole complicated pastor tried to . The dream flickered again . He 'd made it to the new world in steerageno fine Meissen china anymoreand found himself a bed and a job . He was starting over . Barnum 's stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he could go out and look for building work . He thought of Raj , the Bengal tiger , who 'd lain shivering in his fourth-story cage in the museum when last the stableman made his rounds . Of all the animals he cared for , Raj was the one he most identified withhis grace and frustration , his power and imprisonment , his obvious desire to burst forth and do something grander than slouch around Barnum 's . He could devour the world if he were n't chained up in that cage . The stableman felt the same way . He was aware that , cold and poor as he was , the bottom was miles below . What he did n't see , though , our stableman , was how close he lay to the edge of that abyss , how soon he was going to roll off into it . That early March night had been frigid , so what then was this feeling that crept over him nowheat ? Baking , burning heat . Could it be , he wondered , that he 'd frozen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite what the faithful imagined . There was no settlement , no knowledge . Ignorance of Heaven and God persisted , but more cruellydevoid now of any suspense or hope . Nor , yet , was it the nothingness that he 'd expected.So what was going on ? The smell of burning horsehair reached him next , and he glimpsed where he was : in a stable . Not Heaven , not Hell , not with the girl from his dream ; but neither was this his father 's house in the city or his uncle 's farm . He began to identify the sounds that had roused him : animals ' screams , the trumpeting of an elephant , the banging of animal bodies into metal bars and latched stall doors . He was in the circus stable of Barnum 's Museum , on Broadway , in Manhattan . Yellow flames jetted up in one corner through the smoke that billowed around him . The splintery barn wall by his cot was hot against his cheek ; dark wisps of smoke swirled into every orifice . Barnum 's was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
