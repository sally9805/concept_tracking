Warriors #1 : Into the Wild Chapter One It was very dark . Rusty could sense something was near . The young tomcat 's eyes opened wide as he scanned the dense undergrowth . This place was unfamiliar , but the strange scents drew him onward , deeper into the shadows . His stomach growled , reminding him of his hunger . He opened his jaws slightly to let the warm smells of the forest reach the scent glands on the roof of his mouth . Musty odors of leaf mold mingled with the tempting aroma of a small furry creature . Suddenly a flash of gray raced past him . Rusty stopped still , listening . It was hiding in the leaves less than two tail-lengths away . Rusty knew it was a mouse  --  he could feel the rapid pulsing of a tiny heart deep within his ear fur . He swallowed , stifling his rumbling stomach . Soon his hunger would be satisfied . Slowly he lowered his body into position , crouching for the attack . He was downwind of the mouse .

The mouse dived for cover , heading toward a hole in the ground . But Rusty was already on top of it . He scooped it into the air , hooking the helpless creature with his thorn-sharp claws , flinging it up in a high arc onto the leaf-covered ground . The mouse landed dazed , but alive . It tried to run , but Rusty snatched it up again . He tossed the mouse once more , this time a little farther away . The mouse managed to scramble a few paces before Rusty caught up with it . Suddenly a noise roared nearby . Rusty looked around , and as he did so , the mouse was able to pull away from his claws . When Rusty turned back he saw it dart into the darkness among the tangled roots of a tree . Angry , Rusty gave up the hunt . He spun around , his green eyes glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his kill . The sound rattled on , becoming more familiar . Rusty blinked open his eyes . The forest had disappeared . He was inside a hot and airless kitchen , curled in his bed . Moonlight filtered through the window , casting shadows on the smooth , hard floor . The noise had been the rattle of hard , dried pellets of food as they were tipped into his dish . Rusty had been dreaming . Lifting his head , he rested his chin on the side of his bed . His collar rubbed uncomfortably around his neck . In his dream he had felt fresh air ruffling the soft fur where the collar usually pinched . Rusty rolled onto his back , savoring the dream for a few more moments . He could still smell mouse . It was the third time since full moon that he 'd had the dream , and every time the mouse had escaped his grasp . He licked his lips . From his bed he could smell the bland odor of his food . His owners always refilled his dish before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm scents of his dream . But the hunger rumbled on in his stomach , so Rusty stretched the sleep out of his limbs and padded across the kitchen floor to his dinner . The food felt dry and tasteless on his tongue . Rusty reluctantly swallowed one more mouthful . Then he turned away from the food dish and pushed his way out through the cat flap , hoping that the smell of the garden would bring back the feelings from his dream . Outside , the moon was bright . It was raining lightly . Rusty stalked down the tidy garden , following the starlit gravel path , feeling the stones cold and sharp beneath his paws . He made his dirt beneath a large bush with glossy green leaves and heavy purple flowers . Their sickly sweet scent cloyed the damp air around him , and he curled his lip to drive the smell out of his nostrils . Afterward , Rusty settled down on top of one of the posts in the fence that marked the limits of his garden . It was a favorite spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring gardens as well as into the dense green forest on the other side of the garden fence . The rain had stopped . Behind him , the close-cropped lawn was bathed in moonlight , but beyond his fence the woods were full of shadows . Rusty stretched his head forward to take a sniff of the damp air . His skin was warm and dry under his thick coat , but he could feel the weight of the raindrops that sparkled on his ginger fur . He heard his owners giving him one last call from the back door . If he went to them now , they would greet him with gentle words and caresses and welcome him onto their bed , where he would curl , purring , warm in the crook of a bent knee . But this time Rusty ignored his owners ' voices and turned his gaze back to the forest . The crisp smell of the woods had grown fresher after the rain . Suddenly the fur on his spine prickled . Was something moving out there ? Was something watching him ? Rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell anything in the dark , tree-scented air . He lifted his chin boldly , stood up , and stretched , one paw gripping each corner of the fencepost as he straightened his legs and arched his back . He closed his eyes and breathed in the smell of the woods once more . It seemed to promise him something , tempting him onward into the whispering shadows . Tensing his muscles , he crouched for a moment . Then he leaped lightly down into the rough grass on the other side of the garden fence . As he landed , the bell on his collar rang out through the still night air . " Where are you off to , Rusty ? " meowed a familiar voice behind him ...
