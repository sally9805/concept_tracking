HER VOICE-COULD IT BE ? He swiveled away from the computer screen and hunched over the telephone . Yes , it was Nissa , and she was calling from Minneapolis . <p> " It was your father 's obituary-sent of course by Aunt Kit . I had no idea you were so close , Andy ! I mean , Chicago , it 's not like Atlanta or Houston or one of the coasts . You and I did n't fall very far from the old apple tree , did we ? " <p> A tree big enough to cover the whole upper Midwest ? Now he remembered how the budding scientist in him used to chafe over her lax verbal flourishes . " So how long exactly have you been been up there in Minnesota ? " <p> " Oh , forever and ever . I 'll tell all , but here 's the main thing-I just happen to be coming your way . " <p> Good heavens . Here he was in the final throes of writing another grant application . He looked at his watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the day-camp bus , and with a boy like this you absolutely had to be on time and ready to hold on to him as he shot out of the maw of the bus . Thirty-eight years since he 'd heard Nissa 's voice , but there was no way he could stop for her today . Then he understood that she was suggesting next Wednesday , when she would be in town on a buying trip . <p> Had she said furniture store ? He massaged his fingertips into his tight forehead . Was it possible that Nissa , of all people , whose early descent into tragedy might even have helped nudge him into his own sober course , had herself taken refuge in decoration ? <p> Glancing around the closetlike lab office from where he directed his . research team , he wished she could observe him in the devotions of his adult life . He 'd have set himself up in an old packing box if he had to , anywhere , just to keep the postdocs happy in the best physical spaces . So much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up each morning as if his mind , as well as the experiments in the lab , had been incubating important data overnight , pressing to be decoded into conscious bits . But no matter how the momentum seemed to increase as you approached discovery , you still had to get there step by measured step . <p> " Do you think your wife can join us ? " she was saying . " I 'd like to meet her . " <p> Nissa sounded sincere , always had . Teasing , yes , and also with that dangerous tendency to overstate , but he 'd always appreciated back then the undertone modulating her voice , from her experience , he thought , with the resonant fact of death . Drawn to it , almost envying it , he 'd determined even then he wanted a life that would earn him a parallel absolute note . <p> " Unfortunately , she 'll have to miss it-that 's one of the afternoons she teaches a lab course . " <p> " Well , I 'm delighted you can take off , Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close all these years , and I do get down there to Chicago now and then . But I bet you never venture into the Merchandise Mart , do you ? " <p> " You 're right , I do n't think I 've ever been . " <p> She laughed . " I 'd have guessed as much . So , are we agreed on the Art Institute then ? " <p> " Yes , twelve-thirty , I have it . " <p> " Michigan Avenue side , be sure now . " <p> " Yes . " She must have children , too , he thought . <p> " Well , bye-bye for now , Andy . It 'll be absolutely fabulous to see you . " <p> " I hope so . " he hung up . Why had n't he answered that it 'd be wonderful to see her , too ? Absolutely fabulous . <p> He stared at the figure on his screen : he was requesting an additional ten million to carry the research into the next phase . This was his dedicated life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impress on her . When you were racing to finish a grant , you wished you could expand every minute , but thirty-eight years of accomplishment , funny how they could collapse into the sound of a voice from the past . <p> Back then they 'd both been seventeen years old , then eighteen , just good old-fashioned friends . Her heart belonged , she had told him quaintly , to this guy in the town from where she had just moved . By billing himself as a mere escort , Andrew had managed to spend a good deal of time with her during those two years after her parents had been killed in the crash and she 'd come to live with her uncle and aunt . He 'd been well over six feet already , awkward , sinewy , inflamed with acne , burning with his own intelligence and ambition . It had seemed to him that Nissa already contained a complete , fundamental knowledge , which she would simply have to uncover little by little , whereas everything he needed to learn he would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt mistake by mistake . <p> The last time he 'd seen her had been the june dawn after their graduation . Up all night at a class party , they 'd been saying good-bye on the front porch of her aunt and uncle 's house . he was to go east that very day for a summer internship , then directly on to the university . She 'd been laughing . Then she tapped him on his chest , sternum ; his body could almost remember now that lightning spread of awareness . The waking birds were singing like crazy . She tapped him lightly with her fingertips , like a magician . Then he leaned forward and kissed her , not for the first time , but never before like that . She let it last a small moment , not helping him to define it , and then she pulled back and laughed again , not unkindly , and in her most teasing , fanciful voice said , " Oh , Andy , you do make my knees go weak . " <p> He could remember no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make my knees go weak . He 'd had no idea how to reach for anything she was not openly offering him . What he 'd already embraced , he felt , was a future of obstacles and incremental progress and brief moments of insight or joy , the nature of science and of his own temperament , whereas he imagined , while knowing the idea to be irrational , that she might already have been initiated into all it was essential to know about mortal life . <p> She was late . he told himself to enjoy the novelty of standing still , waiting . Many other people were basking in apparent ease on the broad sunny entrance steps . Would he recognize her ? Andrew scouted once more under the shadowed arches and back through the revolving door and into the marble-floored lobby of the museum , where this time the enormous urn of flowers and corkscrew-like branches above the information island struck him as extravagant , in a world as needy as this . <p> Disgruntled , he took his lanky body back outside to his post at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be impatient ; he preferred for every minute to count for something . A dark-eyed boy jumping exuberantly around and around his relaxed parents several steps down reminded him of the youngest of his four children , the only boy , so energetic and prone to accidents Andrew worried about him almost as a reflex . He 'd never felt this vulnerable until he 'd had his boy ; meanwhile his calm wife kept trying to encourage him toward a calmer and more trusting view . <p> Her name was Anne . One September day , after he 'd been called a bachelor for more than a decade , he noticed her in the laboratory , filling the microtitre plates , adjusting the speed of the centrifuge , focusing on the image illuminated by the light box . From then on he found he could only go toward her , trying to learn more , as if she were one of the great discoveries of his life , and this family-to-be-born had all that time been waiting for him like an entire field of meaning . <p> he spied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the opposite cross light on Michigan Avenue , her face turned north where at that moment an ambulance was about to wail and flash through the intersection ; then there she was again , Nissa , now facing east , toward the museum , not yet seeing him . he still had her to himself , had her even as she crossed with the others and came toward the first stairs , below one of the great stone lions , her gray head bent in the bright light . Without this plan to meet , would he have recognized her anyway ? Yes , yes , even with the short gray hair . he did n't care any longer that she had kept him waiting . <p> he bounded down to meet her with some of that lilt of anticipation in his chest he used to feel going home before his parents had died-his mother some years ago , his father just this spring-the lilt of going toward a place of being known almost forever . <p> She was paying attention to the stairs . Under an arm she clutched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open jacket , in colors close to the stone of the lions , and flat shoes . <p> " Nissa . " <p> She looked up , the sun glinting off her sunglasses and her silver jewelry . She shielded her eyes ; her cheeks were flushed . <p> " Andy ! Here you are ! How marvelous ! " She held her hand toward him . <p> all at once they were on the same step , and she was a tall woman facing him ; he had almost forgotten the height of her . <p> " Andy . My goodness-I 'd know you anywhere ! " <p> " That 's just what I thought when I saw you crossing . " <p> She took his arm as they climbed . " Is n't this wonderful ? It 's so incredibly easy . Why did n't it happen years ago ? I guess that 's life for you . " <p> he held his arm steady for her . Her chatter sounded giddy . <p> " Oh , it 's so hot today ! I 've been looking forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that all right with you ? " <p> " There 's a garden ? " <p> " A courtyard . My goodness , Andy , and you 're the one who lives here . " <p> " I 've been a few times , but I guess never in summer . " <p> " Oh , this museum is absolutely one of my favorite places on earth . I 've had such insights here . " <p> " You 'll have to tell me more . " They were in the lobby now , near that extravagant geyser of flowers and weeds and branches . Nissa removed her sunglasses , and he saw once more the intensely blue eyes he remembered . <p> " Oh , how lovely , " she said to the flowers , fanning herself with her hand . " What an oasis . Let 's go straight through to lunch , shall we ? May be we 'll have time for a gallery or two later-how long do you have this afternoon , Andy ? You 're looking a little preoccupied . " <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've been saving up things to ask you . " he followed after her tripping voice . " Over the years you 'd come in and out of my mind , and I 'd wish I could talk over certain things with you . Does that surprise you ? " <p> " You were always good at asking questions , Nissa . " Why had she said preoccupied ? he passed his hand over his brow and attempted to clear his face of whatever might have settled there from habits of thought . <p> " All these years , Andy , and I bet you never even thought of me . " <p> " Not true-I did . " <p> Now in a lofty space , they were skirting a central staircase more complicated than he remembered , double below , branching at a landing into four great , light-struck flights . Nissa led him briskly through a glass door , past a limestone Buddha on his stone lotus , past a tall gray stele of some sort , up a short flight of stairs between two oversized figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a plaque-then into a long dark hall of porcelains , glass boxes of embroidered chasubles and suits of armor , a whole wall of antiquated weapons . . <p> " My boys were very taken with this side of the hall , " said Nissa . <p> he had to hurry to keep up with her , those long legs and flat shoes , striding past a blur of polearms , swords and rapiers , shirts of mail , jousting helmets , crossbows , revolvers , an ivory-stocked pistol in front of which he paused briefly before following her through another doorway . <p> " Do you have sons , Andy ? " <p> " One . You have several , I take it . " <p> " Three . No girls . " <p> " Three ! You with three boys ! Well , what has that been like ? " <p> " What has it been like ? " They emerged from the swords and shields , and Nissa stopped before a brilliant blue wall , predominantly blue , stained-glass panels , another kind of light box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andrew 's eyes roved over the color for a moment and then returned to Nissa 's smooth , flushed cheek . She seemed to be searching for an answer inside the wall of light . " Well , it 's been , I guess you could say , in a word , extremely physical . No one 's ever asked me outright before . Why should it surprise you that I have boys ? " She turned her eyes full upon him . She was n't giddy now , or brisk . And she really had n't changed all that much : he still saw the willowy eighteenyear-old girl . And he remembered with a kind of pang the boy he had been . <p> " I guess I always considered you an expert on girlness . " <p> She laughed and gave him a tiny poke in the ribs . " I 'm glad you thought I was an expert on something . " <p> " I 'm the one with daughters-I have three , along with the boy . " <p> " You do ! Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Oh , I do n't know if anyone 's ever prepared for children . " he was thinking particularly of his son , the energetic , excitable voice , the bloody knees and broken bones , the concussion , the hairsbreadth escapes . " Somehow the generations muddle along . " <p> " I 'm sorry about your father , Andy . But I 'm grateful , too , because without the obituary we would n't be here today . " <p> " True . It 's funny how things happen . " <p> She drew him down a ramp and closer to the luminous wall , and just then he noticed a small figure who appeared to be falling headlong out of the stained blue sky , a little boy perhaps , someone 's son , but Nissa was pointing elsewhere in the field of blue . " Look , Andy : do you see Chagall 's angels here and then over here ? " <p> " Is that what they are ? I suppose I could do with one or two of those , if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry , but his own vision felt watery as he studied the figures , one in a wheel above the falling boy , the other in an orb of pale blue light above a desk , and he wished that he could dispatch both of them instantly to one small dark-eyed boy at day camp . <p> " Pine no more ; I 'm sure you have at least one . No , no , do n't give me that old skeptical look-I refuse to debate angels with you so early in the day . " She took his arm again . " Oh , how marvelous this is , Andy ; it feels so familiar . Is n't this just the sort of thing we used to argue endlessly about-d'you remember ? You were n't about to let me get away with anything . " <p> " Then you have me to thank for the development of your reason . " he peered closer at one of the wall labels and read a quote from the artist , I PREFER A LIFE OF SURPRISES . <p> " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nissa nudged him into motion again . " This way , Andy , we 're coming to my almost absolute favorite thing in the museum . " <p> They passed more Buddhas , a smiling Ganesha whose elephant trunk and round sandstone belly Andrew surprised himself by wishing to stroke , more gods seated with consorts or dancing , dancing and dancing . <p> How tall he and Nissa were , tall and middle-aged and midwesternwhat had they learned so far about the dance of life ? <p> " Now stop here , Andy . This Indonesian sculpture is what I want to show you . It 's very old . Well ? Are n't they simply darlingi " <p> A small mother monkey enfolded a baby on her lap . Andrew leaned closer to the forward-thrusting simian heads , touching ear to ear , the convex , pupilless stone ball eyes , the wide incised smiles . The eight limbs and two tails were so entwined that he found himself counting . " Hmm . Look how elongated those digits are . " An image flashed through his mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , the ones held for control , their eyes watching him when he entered the room , their long fingers gripping the bars , rattling the cages . Sometimes he brought them figs or corn on the cob or other treats , or a new video movie . <p> " Is n't it just completely endearing ? Look at those smiles , Andy . And look how their heads are fused . I 'm simply in love with it . Every time I see it , I melt . " <p> " It 's made of stone . " <p> She laughed . " Yes , yes , it 's made of stone . " She drew him on into another lobby , beyond which he glimpsed the park furred with green , the toy rush of the outer drive , the constant blue band of Lake Michigan , and then she took his arm and turned downstairs to the lower level . <p> " Andy , I 'll just dash into the girls ' room here and repair myself , if you 'll excuse me-d'you want to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was such a darkish , nondescript conduit that his emergence into the outdoor square courtyard felt like an enchantment , of the sort even he was willing at the moment to entertain . A sculpture-fountain and pool bathed the sunstruck center , the surrounding tables and yellow umbrellas were dappled with the fine-leafed shadows of the spreading crowns of locust trees , the strumming of a guitar played over the plashing sound of water . Not for many years had he landed in such a place in the middle of a workday , yes , an oasis . all these people at their ease , this young woman in narrow black pants gracefully leading him to a table , these sounds of silverware and voices , water and music , was this what everyone else did while each day he ate his sandwiches in his cubicle ? Well , hardly ; he knew that well enough . Beyond this great , stonesurrounded space and these galleries of bartered , bought , and pillaged art was the seamless , inescapable , crying world for which he devoted his research in immunology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she had led him , a table beside a tree trunk trimly surrounded by a small hedge . He had to admit that he was grateful to let himself be still and do nothing but take in this cultivated ambience of sound and light and water . Here he was . One thing had led to another : the death of Nissa 's parents , her move to his town and their friendship ; then after all these years his father 's death , the obituary and Nissa 's Aunt Kit , all bringing him to this moment . It was life , his own long , brief life . he felt surprised how much emotion was welling up . <p> Was it true , as some people said , that girls were smarter about the emotions ? Except for his breather as a bachelor , when he 'd used almost all his time in the service of scientific vows , he 'd never lived separate from a swirl of female voices-at first the trio of his mother and older sisters and now his wife and daughters-all making a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer but would never quite yield to his mind , as if they were of a substance just different enough to require perpetual research . But , strangely , what puzzled him most now , after all these girls , was the boy , the late baby , audacious Oliver . Andrew sighed and stretched out his long legs . How were they ever going to get this bundle of energies safely through childhood ? The trajectory along which he was hurtling threatened never to land him into adulthood , where he might come to sit like this , an appreciative man in a repository of civilization . Andrew dropped his head back and gazed up beyond the tilt of the yellow umbrella and the filigree of branches to the summer sky and the unseen interstellar clouds of deep space . <p> " Oh , this is lovely ! " Nissa slid into a chair before he could even rise . " You know , sometimes when it 's thirty below in Minnesota , I dream of this place , with the summer light filtering down and everything beautiful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about little Oliver . <p> " Somewhat . It 's good to have experiences you can fall back on for reference points , do n't you think , like people and places that have been good for you ? " She sloughed off her jacket and took up her menu , but then lowered it . She touched his arm . " People like you , Andy . " <p> " Like me ? Well , if I 'm a pleasant memory to you , then I 'm glad . " <p> " Oh , it 's much more than that . You really were good for me . And it 's partly how we used to talk that was so important-do you know what I mean ? We were young but we talked as if we were old enough to take on the serious questions , and that was so good for me then , you know , after my parents had died , to find a friend who could be serious . I 've wanted for years to thank you for that . I did n't understand then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting people like you all my life and talking like that , but I was wrong , Andy . I 've only met a few , so very few . " Again she reached over to press her fingertips on his forearm . Were there actually tears in her eyes ? <p> " Nissa . Now you 're making me lose my tongue . " <p> She flashed him a challenging look . " Oh , I guarantee you 'll find it in a minute , unless you 've turned into a different person entirely . In those days you were the one who did most of the talking , you know that , do n't you ? " <p> " Me ? Well , could be . I was just a nervous , brainy kid . And you , well , you- " <p> " I was a well-trained female who knew how to put the nickels in and stay quiet . " <p> " Do I need to apologize for all my past errors ? " <p> " No , and I intend to put a few more nickels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me once , Andy ? I 've never forgotten it- " Interrupted by the waitress , whose appearance was like an insouciant reminder of the age they 'd both once been , Nissa turned her flushed cheeks , her blue eyes , the fullness of her matronly attention toward the ordering of grilled breast of chicken , asparagus , iced tea . " And could I have a bit of muffin or bread or something as soon as possible , dear ? I 'm finding myself quite depleted . " <p> What could he have said back then that she had remembered for so long ? Andrew gave his order hurriedly and waited for Nissa to resume her memory of him and of his long-ago words , but by now she had relaxed back in her chair and was casting her eyes over the courtyard , eyes that did look a little tired at this moment , hooded , above a smile that was almost wistful . Then she tipped up her face as if to catch a breeze only she could feel . <p> " So , you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Furniture and more furniture , miles of furniture . But I 'm pleased . so far . Next month I 'm going down to some remarkable workshops in North Carolina . " <p> " This is a business you run with your husband ? " <p> " Oh no , he does n't care much about furniture , other than being comfortable in it . But I 'm having fun . It 's my little way of helping people take a load off . " <p> " And so what does your husband do for fun ? " <p> " Fishing ! But when he 's not beside the water or on the water or in the water , he 's up in the air , piloting private planes , which he also buys and sells . " <p> " A pilot " Good heavens , he 'd never have guessed such a man for her . <p> Nissa flicked over him a smiling glance that seemed to take him in , entirely . <p> " I 'm sorry , Nissa , I live too much in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear all about that world . " <p> " My son seems out to prove that he can fly . " <p> " Oh , do tell me about your son . " Her tea came then , and she paused to drink and drink , her empty hand pressing flat against her chest , until she had nearly drained the tall glass . all at once Andrew saw how swiftly their lunch would be over ; the light in the courtyard seemed already more angled from the southwest . The guitarist stopped just then and set aside his instrument . Near their table other voices sounded abruptly louder , less musical . <p> " I was parched ! " Nissa set down her glass and tore off a segment of bread . " Now tell me , Andy . I want to know about your family and your work . I want to know if you have found out what you said way back then you were going to find out . " She unwrapped a square of butter . He stared at her hands , the knife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he watched as she bit deeply into the center of the molecular bread . Somewhere to his left an object of some sort , like a spoon , clattered to the pavement . he reflected how gravity was the weakest of the forces of nature and how it was gravity that little Oliver seemed to be testing every day with his own miniature , full-body experiments in the dangerous laboratory that he created around himself . <p> In a kind of reverie he asked , " What was it that I said back then anyway ? " <p> " Well . all right . But here , have some of this sourdough bread ; it 's fantastic . all right , what you said . One of the many things was that the reason you wanted to go into medicine and research was to find out about Life and Death , capital L , capital D. You said you wanted to get as close in to the big ones as you possibly could . " <p> " I said that ? Good lord , you must have found me insufferably pompous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . There 've been times when I wished I could be in touch with you to hear what you really were finding out . To compare notes , I guess . " <p> " Well , here we are . But this is funny because I used to feel that you were the one who already knew everything about life and death . " <p> " Oh , I knew almost nothing then , and probably not so much now . But you , Andy , I always thought you 'd find out everything important . I had absolute confidence in you . " <p> " You did ? Why did n't you say so then ? " It might have helped , he did n't add . <p> " I did , I told you . " <p> " No ! Why do n't I remember ? But do you know the one thing I do remember your saying ? Here it is : ' You make my knees go weak . ' " <p> " You 're joking . I 've never talked drivel like that in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that to you . " <p> " No , no , it was you , there was n't any other girl but you . Then . " He stopped . <p> She observed him a moment . " You were n't in love with me , Andy , I absolutely know you were n't . Besides , think how incredibly young we were . " <p> " What happened to that guy anyway , the one who gave you that ugly ring you used to hang around your neck ? " <p> " Oh , poof , him . " Nissa took another bite of bread . Her eyes flashed their deepest blue . " I found I needed someone like Pete who could throw me around a little . " <p> " Nissa ! " <p> She laughed . " I just mean someone really active , who can pick me up and carry me around now and then . " <p> " Is this meant for tender ears like mine ? " <p> " I 'm sorry if I disappoint you , Andy . " <p> " Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate of pasta was placed before him , the food he could scarcely remember ordering . But was he disappointed ? Did he find her now a bit of a lightweight ? he looked up again , to her eyes , that depth . No . <p> Nissa cut into her food . " I would like to hear about your children . " <p> So he began talking not about his important professional work but about his three daughters , the thirteen-year-old and eighteen-year-old calm and serious like their mother , the youngest one musical , the oldest exceptionally studious , bound next year for college ; the middle girl at fifteen sporty and easygoing , not an academic star by any means , but doing all right . " And then there 's the boy , the one who thinks he has wings ; he 's only six . " Andrew heard his own voice catch strangely , and he stopped talking . <p> " Only six ! My boys are all in their late twenties and early thirties ! You did start in on this parenting business later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fountain and saw that the guitarist was taking his chair once more , cradling his instrument across his chest and knees , bending his ear close to the strings , tuning . " How ever did you get your boys that far safely , Nissa ? " he heard himself say just as the first plucked notes floated out and resounded in the court with a clarity that made him want to cry out , Ah ! It was like a sound that had been plucked from somewhere else , almost too sweet to be contained , here . <p> " Andy ? Are you all right ? You have the most remarkable look on your face . " <p> " What ? " he demanded . " Tell me ! " <p> She laughed . " Tell you about yourself ? Yes , is n't that the great secret desire of all of us ? I 'd offer to read your palm if I did n't think it would put you off entirely . Well , all right , what you look like is sort of a cross between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his plate . " Eat something , Andy , I command you . " <p> He took up his own fork . " When did you learn to be sassy , Nissa ? This is something I do n't remember . " <p> " I told you , I had three sons to toughen me up . They taught me to be bold . " <p> " I was thinking about my own son . I worry about him . " <p> " He 's a troublemaker ? " <p> " No , not exactly . Everyone adores him , but from day to day the only thing that 's predictable about him is that he 'll be taking risks . " Andrew zoomed his hand out into the air . " You know how you never know from one instant to the next if a quantum particle will measure like a tiny billiard ball or a wave ? Well , Oliver 's sort of like that . Anne 's labor with him was so fast she hardly had time to do her breathing . " <p> Nissa started laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife ! " <p> " Listen , there 's more . This little guy was climbing out of his crib before he was a year old . By the time he was walking , he had already learned to unlock doors . " <p> " Where 's your son today ? " <p> " We all hope he 's at day camp . " <p> " What happens in school ? " <p> " Well , so far he 's only had kindergarten . he likes the sand table and the balance beam . he likes water . he likes wheels of all sorts . he loves speed . And as I told you , he 's convinced that he 's about one second away from knowing how to fly . And he 's reading , too , did I say that ? His sisters taught him to read when he was four . " <p> Nissa was laughing very hard now . " This splendid boy is going to have his work cut out for him , trying to raise you . " <p> " Nissa , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , strangely , he felt a little less anxious . he took another bite of pasta . " Now you 've got to talk to me about your sons . " <p> " First I want to tell you something I learned when my boys were starting to go away and my heart was really getting torn out of me . The hurt was something terrible . Then I discovered that my job had turned into remembering who they are , essentially , and keeping that inside me all the time . It 's like being pregnant in the heart . Of course I 'd never tell them or anyone else about this . " She stopped a moment and looked at him . " But I guess I have told you . " <p> He 'd been noticing her throat and neck , which was one place where she did look her age . It was fuller , softer , with a slight flush rising from the neckline of her shirt . he imagined a child 's head nestling there , smelling the warm skin , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the girls , " he confided , " but when the boy came , something happened to me . In a way I lost a little of my confidence-I mean , not in other respects , not professionally , of course . " <p> She studied him a moment . " I want you to tell me now about that professional life , Andy . The note from Aunt Kit just said you were doing something with genetics . " <p> He smiled . " I always felt Aunt Kit trusted nothing too dangerous could happen to you with a nerd like me . " <p> " Little did she know about our uncensored talk ! So , start talking . " <p> This was not how Andrew had imagined launching into a description of his research . So much more impressive would have been to show her the lab stocked with equipment , the dozens of other scientists at work , the list of hard-won grants . It took so long for them to label the proteins for the database , to clone and sequence the particular molecules for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their yield , but hardly any time at all to watch his words turning into the expressions on her face , which he was finding he could n't exactly read . <p> " Is what you 're doing safe , Andy ? " <p> " You mean am I in danger ? " <p> " Well , that , of course , but I mean safe for everyone , safe for the future . " <p> " You have n't lost your lightning touch , Nissa . Well , what can I tell you ? That I think about this every day ? That I practically weigh risks and benefits with every breath ? But the genie has been out of the bottle a long , long time-learning ca n't be forbidden . " <p> " Hmm , " she said . " So what comes next for you ? " <p> Microsequencing , he told her , and tissue specificity studies , which was more or less where they were now . " What ? Why are you looking at me like that ? " <p> " Turn your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look behind you . " <p> He did as she said and saw their waitress serving dessert to another table , something yellow with red berries on glass plates . A man was lighting a cigarette-you did n't see that so often now . Unperturbed pigeons waddled from crumb to crumb on the pavement . What was he supposed to notice ? The shadows were slightly longer . Then , as he watched , the hostess slipped one foot out of her shoe and rested it against her other black-trousered leg , like a dancer , like a bird . <p> Andrew turned back to Nissa . " What ? What did you want me to see ? " <p> " I wanted to look at the back of your head . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " His hand flew up to the back of his head , the top of the spine , the base of the brain ; he had dissected heads , he knew the powerhouse he was touching . " Is something wrong ? " <p> She smiled , radiantly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , you remember . And during that whole ceremony I could n't stop looking at your head . It was like a revelation . all of you is good-looking , but the back of your head is really something wonderful . That night you looked like a distinguished grown-up man to me , as if I were seeing way into the future . It made me really happy , Andy . " She stopped ; there were tears in her eyes again . " And here we are . I was right about you ! " <p> " Nissa. " he was spinning in a kind of vertigo back through decades of experience to the youthful self who had talked hour after hour with Nissa beside the public tennis courts , or in the slow garden swing in her aunt and uncle 's backyard , or on the bridge over the river , the bridge that Nissa had loved so much to walk at night , in and out of the segments of light , with the dark , flowing river always beneath . <p> " Do you remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " <p> " Why did you always want to walk on the bridge ? " <p> She shrugged . " That 's true , is n't it ? I always wanted to go across the bridge . " Then she sat back and pressed her lips together . " Oh , Andy . Those years . " Her hands covered her face for a moment , and silver bracelets slid down her arm . <p> They were both quiet . <p> Then he said , " You 'd lost your entire home . " <p> " I 'm older now than my parents ever got to be . It 's new territory . I 'm going alone . " <p> " You 're all right ? Nissa ? I mean , in this part of your life ? " he waited for her , and as he waited he remembered how he had felt driving home in March for his father 's funeral , knowing with each approaching mile that no overseeing presence would be standing at the door to welcome him , never again . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweeping across the plain , as he overrode the past . <p> " Oh , Andy . It 's so wonderful talking with you like this . " She let out a great breath . " Yes , I 'm all right . " Then she went on in a rush : " I see how small my life must seem to you . I mean , you 've done such great things . But I want you to know I have taken risks-interiorly , is what I 'm saying , really looked at how I was living , made changes-oh , I 'm no good at explaining . " Her eyes passed over the courtyard and returned to him , swimming with tears . <p> " Nissa , no ... Nissa , let me tell you something . Of all the people from my past , you 're the one ... I mean talking with you , listening to you , made everything-well , bigger for me . It 's true . You 'd already won victories when I hardly recognized the battles . " <p> When she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on , more playfully now . " You know you can believe me because it 's a point of scientific honor with me not to exaggerate-do you remember ? " <p> After a moment he asked gently , " Now will you tell me about your sons ? I 've just put a nickel in . I want to know about those physical boys who have made you so sassy and bold . " <p> She pulled out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes and took another large breath . " Well , all right then , here 's the story of my wonderful boys . " <p> While she talked , Andrew ate the rest of his lunch . Hers was a very active family ; that much was clear . A house appeared to him , a jumbled entryway of skis and skates and hockey sticks and fishing rods , a kitchen where large dogs threaded their way through a family of human legs , rooms of comfortable furniture , chosen by Nissa , filled by these men who had filled her life . Surrounding this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , then a brief season of sun on a northern lake , a four-wheel-drive vehicle , browed by overturned canoes , pulling into a camping spot and disgorging one , two , three boys , a man , and then Nissa . He saw her , at ease , at home , not as she would have lived if she had married him , but as she had chosen . <p> He saw her . he saw her face , caught in a blanching change of light . Closing his eyes , he saw an afterimage , like an empty white socket in a dark swarming sea of space in which he was suspended , as if between lives , hers , his . <p> " Andy ? Are you all right ? How was your pasta ? " <p> He looked at his empty plate . " Good . I guess . " If he could but eat it again , he thought , he would pay more attention . Nearby tables were being cleared . One of those iridescent pigeons approached the understory of their own table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large swath of the scene seemed overexposed . <p> " I think all the blood has gone to my stomach , " he said . <p> " Let 's go inside . Let 's just wander a little . D' you have time ? " <p> " Some , yes . My son 's camp bus comes at five . " <p> He watched her push back her chair and take up that big leather bag again . " I 've got some chocolates here , Andy , courtesy of one of the showrooms-want any ? " he shook his head no , but she still handed him two gold-wrapped coins . " Take some for the road anyway . " Then out of the bag came lipstick , and after a few swift painting motions she grinned at him , in one flash both mocking vanity and enjoying beauty . <p> " Nissa , " he mused , as he slipped the discs into his shirt pocket , " how was it that we lost touch with each other ? " <p> " Well , you went east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went west . And then I guess life took over . " <p> They climbed upward , retraced their path past the smiling mother monkey and her smiling baby , past Buddha , past the gods , the goddesses , past Chagall 's blue window where Andrew located once more the boy who was still safely there , falling without really falling from the sky . <p> " Shall we go up to the modern galleries , Andy ? " <p> " You lead . " <p> On the way up broad marble stairs he caught a great visual expanse of blue on the landing above , something very broad and blue and white happening up there , like water . Their climb was like rising to the light-filled surface of water . <p> But it was not water : it was an enormous horizontal sky , audaciously viewed by the artist as if from above an ordered sea of many white oval clouds , all stacked toward the pink-and-blue distance like celestial building blocks , mortared by blue . Andrew stopped still . There was a lurch in his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen or swooped . Then the surprise spread out to a kind of broad weightlessness . <p> " You like this ? " asked Nissa . <p> Andrew nodded . " I must bring my son here . It 's meant for him . " <p> " I think there 's quite a story how O'Keeffe finally got that gigantic canvas stretched , " said Nissa . " You can imagine the technical difficulties , the sheer heft of it . Oh , my goodness , Andrew ! I 've just had a brilliant idea ! Why did n't I think of it sooner ? Your boy must come up in one of the airplanes with Pete . Would n't that be fabulous ? He 'd have a chance to sit right up there with the controls , he 'd be flying low enough to see everything , he 'd be able to ask questions . Your whole family must come ! What d' you think ? " <p> Andrew felt as if his heart had melted into his son 's , and he had just lifted directly off into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " absolutely fabulous . " <p> When they said good-bye in front of the museum , the sunlight was penetrating into the stone archway . " Give me your hand a minute , please , Andy . " She held his open palm in hers and tilted it toward the strong light . " Hmm . " <p> " Well ? You ca n't stop now . " <p> She traced a line or two as if they were runes . " It 's just what I always knew . You have a lovely heart , Andrew . " <p> " That 's all you 'll tell me ? " he kept his palm open and insistent before her . <p> " You 'll actually listen to more-you the scientist ? Well , all right , do you see these squares ? That means the universe is taking care of you , and here , and here , like fingerprints , they 're marks of God . And these triads ? You 've absolutely got to be of service to mankind , it 's your mission , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded his fingers over his palm . " That 's enough for now . Your nickel has run out . " <p> He caught up her hand and brought it to the center of his chest . <p> Other people swished around them , other voices . <p> Andrew kept hold of her . " Where are you going now ? " <p> " To one more showroom and then out to the airport-and then home where I 'll start planning this brilliant meeting of our families . Talk to your wife about it , all right ? " Nissa slipped her fingers from his . Then for a moment she was occupied with sunglasses ; her eyes disappeared ; her mouth smiled at him once more : she was a tall woman prepared to go back into the city streets . he did not have her ; he had himself , his life , the rest of his life . <p> Alone in the summer crowd , he walked north past trees , artists ' stalls , musicians , a hurdy-gurdy ice-cream truck from which he might have bought cones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no clouds , only an astonishing blue . The leaves of the trees were of a green soaked with his surprise in simple sight . Gulls crossed the upper corridors of air against a backdrop of skyscrapers while to the open east along the distant stripe of lake the white sails of many small boats , all filled with wind from the southwest , curved into their course . <p> He had to leave the surface world to find his car , pass through a concrete tunnel that echoed with a lone fiddle player , into whose case he dropped a handful of coins , and then descend a flight of steps to the lower level of the garage , where dank walls oozed an efflorescence of calcium and the air reeked of urine and automobile exhaust . A child was crying somewhere out of his sight in the concrete bays of automobiles , an overtired child probably , crying not monotonously , though , but in an acutely distressed way , a child who had probably fallen down and whose pain was compounded by this desolate underground eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of some sort , an adult voice , female . Then silence . A slam of metal , like the trunk of a car . <p> It had been a false silence , a held breath . The crying burst out renewed with more than unhappiness : with terror . The screaming adult voice lashed out with an " I SAID STOP IT ! " so hoarse and terrible and desperate in its own way that Andrew shuddered . <p> " No , no , Mama , Mama , MAMA ! " screamed the child 's voice , hiccuping , convulsed , but the one called Mama screamed louder : " I SAID , I SAID STOP ! " <p> Where were all the other people , the good citizens ? he was alone with the voices . Where were the gods , the goddesses , where were the angels of that child ? Andrew came to the end of one section of concrete and crossed into the next bay , identical except for the figures a dozen feet away , frozen in front of an open car door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl without recourse before her , beneath her . <p> The arm in the air was what he lunged at , his hand seizing the bare clammy flesh . " WHAT THE- " She whirled around to him , away from the startled child . he stared into an abyss of exhaustion in the woman 's eyes that nearly sucked away his breath . " SON OF A BITCH ! " She yanked at her arm , but he kept it buttressed aloft . <p> " My mother 's name was Sylvia , " he said . <p> " Who in the HELL do you think you are ! " She pulled again to free her arm , and this time he let it go . The child was still crying , endlessly crying , though not as loud now . Stop , he wanted to implore , stop crying now j please , if you know what 's good for you , stop ! But the child could n't stop . " SHUT UP ! " the woman screamed . " GET IN THE CAR ! " But the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endless underground world so cast in concrete and metal and the ceaseless mechanical roar of a huge grilled wall fan that nothing , nothing could change it . <p> A sweat broke out over Andrew ; his shirt clung to his back and his heaving chest , where he felt the small weight in his pocket of the sweets Nissa had given him . he reached in . " Here , look ! " he heard himself say to the child . " Look what I have here ! " Swiftly he crouched and placed a gold circle in the small hand . " It 's only chocolate , " he said , rising to the woman . And before she could scream again he had offered her the second lozenge in his open palm , close under her chin . For a moment there was only the labored roar of the fan . The child was silent . The fury in the woman 's face , surprised , did not know what to change into . " Please , " said Andrew to the woman . <p> All at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate flew out of his palm and rolled away . " Get in the car ! " she said to the little girl , who whimpered as she was yanked by one arm up onto the seat , but she held fast to the chocolate , and she did not cry . The door slammed , and then all Andrew could see was the top of her small head , brown curls , bent over what she held in her hand . " You think you 're smart , do n't you ? " the woman hurled at Andrew . " You think you 're so goddamn smart ! You do n't know anything ! " Then as she rounded the front of the car , she sobbed out " People like you ! " and something else that he could n't understand as she heaved herself into the driver 's seat and started the motor and pulled out , backward , then forward with a screech . At the far end of the bay she nearly collided with an incoming car . Horns blared . And then it was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The incoming car wanted the empty place where he stood . There were young people behind the windshield , a girl and a boy , seventeen , eighteen , maybe , laughing about something . he moved out of the way and went to his own car and got in . Sweat was still streaming down the sides of his face , down the runnel of his back . The boy and the girl hopped out of their car simultaneously , a choreographed emergence , two separate bodies that locked back together , hands in each other 's denim back pockets , as they sashayed down the length of the concrete wall and through the doorway and out of sight . <p> Andrew started his motor and slowly pulled out of his parking space . He wanted to be aware of each thing he did . he joined another exiting car at the end of the bay , and then another and another in a line to the ticket booth , and then a stream of cars flowing up the ramp into a flash of sunlight and a low-sailing flock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in good time to retrieve his boy at the day-camp bus , and then together they would make their way mile by mile home . <p>
