There are men worth dying for and others who really just need to die . <p>  --  The Lighter Side of Death <p> When our marriage ended ten years ago , I figured that was it . I would never see Scott Colvin again . I certainly did n't expect him to be at the open house for this Marina District $1.4-million fixer-upper . But there he was , standing right in the middle of the living room , making it impossible for me to concentrate on the water-stained ceiling or broken light fixture . His body was angled away , so I could only make out a partial profile , but I had no doubt about his identity ; that was Scott and the very sight of him brought on a slew of conflicting emotions . One of them was hope . Hope that someone had secretly dropped acid in my Frappuccino and that the thing that looked like Scott was nothing more than a messed-up hallucination . <p> I had taken hallucinogenics once before , during my freshman year in college . Perhaps if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain cells I might have had the presence of mind not to get married at nineteen . Fortunately my brain cells were working again by my twenty-first birthday and I celebrated their recovery by getting a divorce . <p> But this moment did n't have the feel of a hallucination . The Frappuccino in my hand tasted real . The hopelessly out-of-date faux-wood paneling looked real . The mildew on the windows smelled real . And Scott looked like a real real-estate agent trying to convince a real middle-aged Japanese couple that the house we were all here to see really was n't contaminated with asbestos . People on drugs see diamonds in the sky and riders on the storm ; they do n't see real-estate agents and overpriced four-bedroom houses that need new flooring . That meant that what I was hearing , seeing and smelling was all horribly real . <p> But the good news was that he had n't seen me yet . I pivoted and tried to lift my wedge heel off the floor so I could quietly tiptoe out . <p> " Are my eyes deceiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Shit ! I turned around again and was confronted by Scott 's teasing smile . " What do you know , it is you ! " he continued . The Japanese couple was now climbing the creaking staircase to check out the second floor . " Of all the open houses in the world you had to walk into mine . " <p> I grimaced and made a sweeping gesture with my hand . " You 're the agent representing this mess ? " <p> " Apparently you did n't read the ad I ran in the paper . " He handed me a promotional flyer detailing the house 's few saving graces . " It 's not a mess , it 's an opportunity . " <p> I almost smiled . Almost . " Save your BS for the couple upstairs . I 'm out of here . " <p> Once again I turned to leave , but Scott quickly jogged in front of me so that I had to stop to keep myself from slamming into his chest . " Sophie , we have n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be angry at me . " <p> " I 'm pretty sure I can be . " <p> " Nah , you just think you are . " Scott 's hazel eyes were twinkling with mischief . That 's usually what they did when they were n't red from getting stoned . " You 're really mad at the old Scott . The kid you were married to . But we 're both grown-ups now , old enough to understand the value of forgiveness . Remember , grudges always have a greater effect on the lives of those who carry them than on the lives of those they 're carried against . " <p> " Wow , that 's pretty deep , Scott , " I said solemnly . " So let me think about this . During the time that I 've been holding this grudge , I 've become an internationally published bestselling author . I have wonderful friends . My family is healthy and reasonably happy . I have a fantastic cat and a boyfriend whom I adore . I 'd say this grudge is working pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Do n't you want to know why I 've been calling you ? " <p> After ten years of no contact , Scott had , as of five months ago , taken to calling me every few weeks and leaving messages on my answering machine . Of course I wanted to know why , but I was n't going to give him the satisfaction of admitting to my curiosity . Instead I shrugged and retorted , " Do n't you want to know why I have n't been returning those calls ? " <p> He chuckled , apparently finding humor in my irritation . " I think the answer to your question is a lot more obvious than the answer to mine , " he said . <p> I hesitated a moment and studied the countenance of this new " grown-up Scott . " He had the beginnings of crow's-feet , but other than that he looked exactly the same . He had the same blond wavy hair that was always a little mussed , and of course he still had one dimple in his left cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days surfing off China Beach . Once upon a time I had thought that his looks were the perfect complement to my darker , more exotic appearance . My father was black and my mother has the fair complexion common to her Eastern European Jewish ancestry . People were always confused and delighted by my ethnicity . They usually do n't know exactly " what " I am yet they find my very existence to be a sign of hope for the improvement of race relations everywhere . However , the attention I get now is a pittance compared to the attention I got when I was with Scott . Together we were a walking Benetton ad . Of course I get a certain amount of attention when I go out with my current fair-skinned , Russian-born boyfriend , Anatoly Darinsky But our differences are less visually dramatic thanks to Anatoly 's dark hair and brown eyes . <p> " I got your latest book , The Lighter Side of Death . It 's good . " He inched a little closer . " I 've also been reading about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amateur sleuth . According to the Chronicle you apprehended your own stalker , you helped figure out who killed your brother-in-law , and you even had a hand in bringing down the guy who killed that political aide in Contra Costa County . " He gave me an approving once-over . " Sounds like you 've turned into a real-life Charlie 's Angel . Of course , you 've always been an angel in my eyes . " <p> " Ugh . " I wrinkled my nose in disgust . " I think I 've just been slimed . I 'm going now . " <p> I started to walk around him , but Scott quickly sidestepped in front of me . " What if I told you that I had a brand-new listing for a recently renovated Ashbury Heights three-bedroom Victorian . " <p> I hesitated . " How recently renovated ? " <p> " Five years ago . " <p> Only five years ago ? Not bad . " Floors ? " <p> " Hardwood . The owner has a thing for Persian rugs so the floors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was still focused on the door , but my feet did n't follow my gaze . " Okay I 'll bite . Who 's the owner , and why is he selling ? " <p> " The owner 's name is Oscar Crammer , and he 's selling because he thinks the place is haunted . " <p> " Why 's that ? " I asked . " Was anyone ever murdered in the house ? Because if it 's a site of a recent homicide it should be selling for at least ten thousand below market . " <p> " Sophie , the owner 's only asking for $980,000 . " <p> I broke out in a full laugh . " Yeah , right , a renovated , three-bedroom Ashbury Heights Victorian selling for under a million ? Tell me , Scott , does it come with its own leprechaun , too ? " <p> " I know it does n't sound possible , but it 's true . " He hesitated before adding , " I think the guy selling may have the beginnings of Alzheimer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some guy with Alzheimer 's ? " I snapped . <p> " It has a two-car garage , Sophie . " <p> My heart skipped a beat , but my sense of morality would not allow me to be tempted by this alluringly wicked proposal . " I wo n't scam a sick man , Scott . Not even for parking . " <p> " Oscar 's old money . He 's got at least ten to twenty million in the bank and his son , Kane , has made millions more in the stock market . He sold off his investments in 2007 , before the Dow got squirrelly Plus I know for a fact that Kane has been trying to get Oscar to sell the house and move into a retirement home ever since the old man became a widower . So by buying this place you 'd be doing everybody a favor . " <p> I turned all of this info over in my mind . It still was n't ethical to take advantage of an old man with a possibly fatal illness but it had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs and headed into the kitchen just as an Armani-clad gentleman stepped into the entryway Scott smiled at the latter and nodded at the former before leaning in a little closer and whispering , " I just got the listing this morning . If you want to be the first to see it we could meet there at eight-thirty tonight . " <p> " Eight-thirty ? " I asked in a voice much louder than his . " What kind of real-estate agent shows houses at eight-thirty at night ? " <p> " One who is trying to get his ex-wife to give up an outdated grudge , " Scott said . " Tomorrow I have to tell all my other clients about this , and at that price you know they 're going to descend upon it like a bunch of hungry hyenas . But since I do kinda owe you " <p> " You kinda owe me ? " I parroted . " While we were married you spent my entire inheritance on gambling , alcohol and the various sluts you were screwing . You more than kinda owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you before anyone else , " Scott continued , ignoring my brief tirade . " If you 're the first to make an offer the old man might take it before a bidding war has a chance to break out . The guy is motivated with a capital M. " <p> I chewed on my lower lip and glanced at the Armani guy who was now knocking on one of the walls  --  probably testing to see if it could withstand the impact . This is what $1.4 million could buy you in San Francisco . I had written six New York Times bestselling novels and yet I could barely afford to buy this moldy rat hole with a view . With that in mind how could I not take Scott up on this once-in-a-lifetime offer ? <p> Another couple walked in and Scott flashed them one of his most charming smiles while whispering through his teeth , " So , we on for tonight or not ? " <p> I squeezed my eyes closed and forced myself to make the only rational decision available to me . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at eight-thirty . " <p> I drove my Audi through the residential streets of Ashbury Heights . Victorian after Victorian blurred into one another as I sped by . There were few pedestrians out although there were probably more than you could count several blocks over where the local shops and restaurants populate Cole Street . I was tempted to turn my car around and head that way now . I could play quarters with some bartender and laugh at the knowledge that my evil ex was standing around an empty house waiting for me . It would be petty , though perversely sweet entertainment . But as I brought the car to a halt at each stop sign , my mind came screeching back to the conversation Scott and I had earlier . I did n't have a problem with being petty , but stupidity was not something I was comfortable with . I had to at least see the place . <p> It was 8:40 p.m. when I found the address Scott had given me . He 'd told me to park in the driveway , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the quiet street and staring at the building to my left . The windows were all dark , but the streetlamp illuminated the details of the exterior . It was no bigger than the houses to the left or right , but still , it was superior . Unlike its neighbors , this house was not painted in pastels , but in a color that hovered between tan and a muted lilac . Its gabled shingled roof shielded its angled bay windows from the hazy evening sky . It was beautiful and oddly familiar . I must have passed it before and somehow taken notice of it . As my eyes traveled from the roof to the foundation I spotted Scott huddled between the Greek-styled columns bordering the front entrance . Watching me and toying with the zipper of his insulated brown suede jacket , his presence surprised me . When I had been married to Scott we had both considered punctuality a dirty word . Slowly I pulled into the driveway which was so narrow that it barely accommodated the width of my car . <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slipped out of the car and trotted up the front steps . <p> " Got here at eight-twenty . " He got to his feet and brushed some nonexistent dirt from his jeans . " I figured you 'd be late , but I thought I should get here early just in case you 'd changed . " He smiled , bringing his dimple into view . " I 'm glad to see that you 're still the same ol ' Soapy . " <p> I let out a disdainful puff of air . Soapy was the pet name he had assigned to me after we had gotten into a soapsuds fight while washing my old car . It brought back irritatingly fond memories . <p> " Let 's see the house , " I said coolly . As front doors went , this house had a pretty nice one . Tastefully carved without being too ornate or flowery . " Where 's the owner staying ? " <p> " Hotel Nikko , " Scott said as he fiddled with the key . <p> " Really ? Why does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I exclaimed as he opened the door to reveal the foyer . " Are those crown moldings ? " <p> " Better believe it , baby . Crown moldings fit for a queen . " As we stepped inside he sniffed the air suspiciously . " That 's Pine-Sol , " he said slowly . " Oscar must have cleaned before leaving . " <p> I barely registered Scott 's comment . I was in the living room looking at the bay windows and the lovely upholstered window seat . The furniture was n't my style , very flowery in a Victorian kind of way , but I was n't buying the furniture . The gorgeous built-in mahogany bookcases though , those would be mine ! <p> " That 's strange . " <p> I turned at the sound of Scott 's voice behind me . I had almost forgotten he was there . " What 's strangewait , that does n't look fake . " I pointed at the fireplace behind him . " It 's not just decorative ? It 's real ? A real honest-to-God fireplace that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starter , too , " Scott confirmed . " But that 's not what 's weird . What 's weird is that Oscar seems to have rearranged all the furniture . This place has been totally redecorated since this morning . " <br> Continues ...
