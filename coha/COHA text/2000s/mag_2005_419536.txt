The raw power , the crafty mental approach , the deadly putts . In his magnum opus Golf My Way ( the best-selling instructional book ever ) , Jack Nicklaus told millions how . Here are a few of the master 's swing fundamentals that you can use during your next round . ( Bumble-bee outfit not included . ) I play every standard shot with the ball in the same position relative to my feet . That position is opposite my left heel . BALL POSITION So far as my own game is concerned , I keep the ball 's position fixed , for the following reasons : First , simplicity is my ultimate objective in the golf swing . I strive to eliminate needless complexities from what must ... always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so by angled terrain or the demands of unorthodox shots , moving the ball 's position at address is ... a needless complexity . Second , in a full , free , powerful golf swing , the clubhead travels along a straight path very momentarily . The talk you sometimes hear about swinging " on line for a foot or more through the ball " is so much bunk . The ideal is to have the clubhead traveling along the correct path ... during that infinitesimal moment when the ball is actually on its face . In my swing , all those things concur ... with every club when the ball is positioned in line with my left heel . LOOKING AT THE BALL Although I 'm right-handed , I feel my left eye is my master eye . At least , it has become my master eye in golf . It 's the one through which I predominantly " see " the ball . This has to be true because at the top of the swing on a full drive , my head is so positioned that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My right eye does have a role , however . Through ... peripheral vision , I actually see the club start back from the ball . I can  --  and do  --  check that it 's on the correct path ... predominantly with my right eye . Although I consciously look at the ball until well after impact , I 'm never conscious of seeing it hit . It just suddenly vanishes . But even without looking after it , I can tell exactly where it 's going from the " feel " of impact . Usually I look at the ball whole , not at a particular part of it . But I have found on occasions that focusing specifically on the rear half of the ball helps me make better contact . A BIG-HIT STANCE ADJUSTMENT When I 'm really going for a big one , I make a slight stance adjustment that speeds up my leg thrust and hip turn . I simply point my left foot more toward the target . ... This gives me , in effect , a " running start " in shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing . If you try this , be sure you start down with your legs . If you do n't , the " opened " left-foot position will make it very easy for you to spin your shoulders " over the top . " FORCING THE LEGS TO WORK Sometimes , when I 've laid off golf for a while , my legs are n't in any condition to work correctly in my forward swing . Until I get my legs back in shape through practicing and playing , or exercising , I try to keep the upward movement of my left shoulder as slow as possible on my forward swing . ( This ) gives my legs a little more time to move laterally toward the target before my shoulders have a chance to take over the swing involuntarily and ruin the shot . If you can keep that upward left-shoulder movement relatively slow as you start back to the ball , you 'll find that your legs are virtually forced to work toward the target . A RIGHT-FOOT SWING INDICATOR The alignment of the right foot at the finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . If your right foot is roughly vertical after you have gone up onto its toes , you 'll most likely have swung nicely " under " yourself . But if your right heel leans over toward the target line a good deal , you 'll more than likely have swung " around " yourself . FIRMING UP THE LEFT SIDE The right side must stay " under " the left side through impact . For it to do so , the left side must provide resistance : it must be firm , extended , resilient . I achieve this left-side resistance through a feeling of stretching from my left foot to the tip of my left shoulder  --  without , let me add , straightening my left knee .
