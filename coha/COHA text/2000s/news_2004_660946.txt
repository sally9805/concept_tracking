<p> The Little Ice Age and " the 8,200-year event " are not exactly household terms . Once only a handful of climate scientists puzzled over these episodes of abrupt climate change . Now , the topic is getting close scrutiny from the Pentagon , the halls of Congress , and even Hollywood - where a disaster movie set for release in May depicts a sudden deep freeze . <p> One reason for all the interest ? While policymakers have worried long and hard about global warming , which might raise Earth 's temperature 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C by century 's end , a growing body of evidence suggests natural forces could just as easily plunge Earth 's average temperatures downward . In the past , the planet 's climate has changed 10 degrees in as little as 10 years . <p> That may not sound like much . But the last time the planet was 10 degrees colder , it was still in an ice age . " There 's the very real potential of the climate system changing dramatically and rapidly " in ways that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who heads the paleoclimatology program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . <p> The possibility of a sudden freeze does n't mean mankind can relax efforts to curb global warming , many scientists warn . Indeed , given the complexity of Earth 's climate , human activities that spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may increase the potential for an abrupt cooling . <p> For example : Regional and global climates have undergone quick and dramatic changes even after what would appear to be only gentle prodding by natural influences , Dr. Eakin says . In many cases , that prodding has been far less severe than the changes humans have wrought via industrial emissions of carbon dioxide . <p> " In the absence of better knowledge , we have to assume that humans are making abrupt climate change more likely - not because humans are worse than nature , it 's just because we 're changing the system , " says Richard Alley , a Penn State University paleoclimatologist . Dr. Alley led a 2002 National Research Council panel that examined abrupt climate change and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Policymakers are beginning to pay attention . Last week , the Senate Commerce , Science , and Transportation Committee sent to the full Senate a bill that would give NOAA $ 60 million for research into the causes of abrupt change . The work could help provide more accurate modeling of past and future climate change , perhaps yielding clues that could serve as an early warning to abrupt change . <p> Meanwhile , a report prepared for the Defense Department bids Pentagon planners to elevate the study of abrupt climate change " beyond a scientific debate to a US national security concern . " The study was prepared by the Global Business Network , a corporate strategic planning and consulting firm in Emeryville , Calif . <p> These actions are fueled by a growing body of evidence over the past five years that Earth 's climate has a history of rapid variations - and that if the paleoclimate record is any indication , this history repeats itself . Some periods , like the Little Ice Age , would cause hardships today , but industrial countries probably could adapt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1300 to around 1870 and dropped temperatures in parts of the northern hemisphere by about 1 degree C. <p> To the casual observer , that drop may seem small . But from a climate and a social standpoint " it was huge , " says Lloyd Keigwin Jr. , a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) in Woods Hole , Mass . <p> The year without summer <p> The Little Ice Age - actually three distinct cooling periods - chilled northern Europe and parts of the United States . It sent the Vikings back to Europe from their outposts in Greenland . Farms in Norway were covered with glaciers and crop failures around Europe caused famines and spikes in grain prices . <p> In 1816 , New England experienced its " year without summer , " when many crops failed . One researcher argues that the storm that wiped out a large part of the Spanish Armada - and made Sir Francis Drake 's job easier - was part of the Little Ice Age pattern . <p> " The Little Ice Age is the only abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Dr. Keigwin . <p> Other abrupt changes , like the rapid cooling event that peaked 8,200 years ago , could be far more disruptive . <p> As scientists have studied the climate record trapped in glacial ice from Antarctica and Greenland , and in mud samples extracted from beneath the ocean floor , their respect for the speed of change has grown . In the mid-1950s , a change of roughly 3 degrees C over more than 1,000 years was deemed abrupt . In 1999 , a team led by Jeffrey Severinghaus at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Calif. , determined that the last ice age ended with a temperature burst that raised the thermostat at Greenland by some 9 degrees C over a mere decade . <p> " We still do n't understand the causes " behind the increase , he says . A range of abrupt regional and global changes poses the same challenge . <p> Atlantic conveyor belt <p> One potential source of change may be the North Atlantic , researchers say . There , warm water moves north along the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface water reaches the far northern portions of the North Atlantic basin , it has cooled and grown denser than the underlying layers of ocean , and it begins to sink . The water then travels south along the bottom , driving an aquatic " conveyor belt " that spans the globe . <p> But researchers suspect that if enough fresh water , perhaps from melting ice , is injected into key spots in the North Atlantic , it can virtually shut down the conveyor . Fresh water is more buoyant than salt water and can form a layer that blocks the circulation . The Northern Atlantic region would then cool . Reduce the fresh water , researchers say , and the reverse can happen , warming the North Atlantic region . <p> Yet much of the evidence for this comes from records when the planet 's climate was already cool , some scientists argue . So the evidence may not hold lessons for today , when the planet is in a warm hiatus between glacial periods . A more timely test of the North Atlantic 's role in abrupt climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery of a rapid cooling event that peaked 8,200 years ago . <p> By the standards of the Little Ice Age , the 8,200-year event was frosty and global . Although the event lasted only about 100 years , Greenland 's temperatures dropped by about 3 degrees C. Indeed , the consultants who argue for upgrading the national security status of abrupt climate change used this event as their model . <p> Several researchers say the cooling 8,200 years ago may have been triggered by the collapse of ice dams holding back the waters of Lake Agassiz - a vast glacial reservoir covering the Great Lakes region of the US and Canada at the end of the last ice age . It would have flushed enough fresh water into the right places in the North Atlantic to shut down the conveyor . <p> But here , too , the picture grows murky . At a meeting last fall at the WHOI , researchers from the US and Canada looked at the problem and raised more questions than answers . For instance , no one has yet seen conclusive topographical evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agassiz did surge into the Hudson Straits and the Labrador Sea , they surely would have carved a path in the land . This lack of evidence has sent some searching for an outflow path to the north , into the Arctic Ocean . <p> Core samples from the ocean floor also fail to confirm the Hudson Straits-Labrador Sea theory , says Mr. Keigwin of the WHOI . Instead , he has found evidence of freshening in the water much farther south and hugging the coast . This suggests that the water may have entered the Atlantic too far south to affect the conveyor - at least directly . <p> " This is an important problem , " he says . If scientists can prove that freshening of the ocean did occur during this current period between ice ages , then the possibility of global warming triggering an abrupt climate change would have to be taken more seriously , he adds . " We need a coordinated effort " to answer the riddle . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
