<p> KIRKLAND , Wash .  --  The great ones live in memory because of their signature moves . Emmitt Smith , with a hand on the back of a blocker , maneuvering in close quarters . Walter Payton , all knees and elbows , refusing to be tackled . Eric Dickerson , accelerating to the outside with loping strides . <p> And then there 's Shaun Alexander . What defines him as a running back ? To paraphrase a lovely old jazz tune , it 's " All The Things You Are Not . " <p> Not fast enough . Except no one catches him in the open field . <p> Not tough enough . Except for the 27 rushing touchdowns . <p> Not elusive enough . Not explosive enough . Not . Not . Not . <p> Which leave the league-leading total of 1,880 rushing yards , 28 touchdowns , including a scoring reception , that set a single-season record , the 89 rushing touchdowns in 96 games that have him in arrears of only 11 players as inexplicable as the stone heads of Easter Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put their finger on , " says Alexander , 28 . <p> Alexander and the Seahawks ( 13-3 ) racked up the best record in the NFC this season and earned a first-round playoff bye and home-field advantage throughout . They are hosts Saturday to the defensive-minded Washington Redskins as they seek their first playoff victory since 1984 . <p> They got here riding Alexander . And that 's how they 'll go forward . <p> " Their running back can hurt you in any way , " Washington coach Joe Gibbs says . " He can hurt you by catching the ball out of the backfield . He is extremely dangerous in terms of breaking one . " One or more . <p> Alexander carried 370 times this season and averaged 5.1 yards , leading the Seahawks to their best record . He had a touchdown run of 88 yards , second longest in the league , and topped all rushers with 54 carries of 10 yards or more . He has managed a run of 10 yards or more in 55 consecutive games , the NFL 's longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running backs coach Stump Mitchell says , " are staggering . " <p> Yes , but . Try to name the memorable run . The Bo Jackson burst around the end . The Tony Dorsett wiggle-and-go up the middle . The Jim Brown knockout . Ca n't do it . <p> " I 've blocked for dang near every yard he 's gotten , and I do n't know what his style is . It 's deceptive , " Seahawks center Robbie Tobeck says . " It looks sometimes like when he 's in the open field that he 's not running , and you 're like , ' Run faster . ' But no one 's catching him . " <p> How did Alexander become the sum of things he is n't ? How can he touch a football and leave no fingerprints ? " Join the club . ... None of us know . I do n't think the coaches know , " quarterback Matt Hasselbeck says . " It 's a mystery . " <p> Rack up the film . Watch Alexander , but without his number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> " Did you watch the whole game ? The touchdowns , " he says with a laugh . But touchdowns are the end , not the means . What happened to the beautiful process , where the journey is half the fun ? <p> A couple of years back , during training camp , Alexander took a handoff and ducked behind his offensive line . He seemed to disappear , then materialize downfield . One of the marveling defensive backs nicknamed him " Ghost . " <p> Appropriate . He does all this damage to opponents , scores one touchdown after the next , but leaves no trail , only wreckage . <p> " You may not consider him a power runner , but in those situations he is all that he has to be and all that we need him to be , " Mitchell says . " You may not consider him a speed burner , but he 's one of two or three guys who , in their NFL career , have an 88-yard run . You may say he is not a certain thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the goal line <p> Including his 11 touchdowns on receptions , Alexander has 100 TDs in his six-year career and got to triple digits faster than anyone but Emmitt Smith . There are times when , in trying to conserve his strength and body , he might not fight for the last inch , but he refuses to be turned away when the Seahawks approach the end zone . <p> " That 's my favorite part of the game , honestly , " he says . <p> Down there ? Where it is , in Hasselbeck 's words , " a fistfight in a phone booth ? " There ? <p> There . <p> " I 'm always harping on everybody , like , ' Let 's not kick field goals , let 's not get used to that , ' " Alexander says . " You score touchdowns , you 're going to win the games . That 's what it is for me . " <p> It does n't happen by accident . In front of him stands a veteran line anchored on the left side by tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard Steve Hutchinson , three times a Honolulu tourist . Those two , Tobeck and guard Chris Gray have been together since 2001 ; right tackle Sean Locklear became a starter this season . There 's also 12-year fullback Mack Strong , going to his third Pro Bowl . <p> " When you have a great line , you 're supposed to do great things , " Alexander says . " Life is more fun when you 've got partners . " <p> Of his 27 record-tying rushing touchdowns , 24 came from inside the 20 , 20 from inside the 10 and 18 from inside the 5 . " The scary thing about Shaun scoring all these touchdowns is that everybody on the planet knows he 's going to get the ball . Yet he still finds a way to get into the end zone , " Strong says . <p> Alexander loves telling the story of his peewee football days in Kentucky . He returned two kickoffs for touchdowns in a game his team lost , then asked his older brother , Durran , which position would permit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and it is his unshakable belief that he can , must and will reach the end zone as often as possible . <p> " If the line blocks and I score touchdowns , then we 're going to win . Now , what gives us the most chances to win ? Well , the more I score , " he says . " The heart of it is winning , but if I score some more , we 're going to be able to win some more . " <p> So it seems like he needs a larger helmet , right ? This is an ego in need of a cold compress to reduce the swelling , no ? No . Look at the numbers . When he scores two rushing touchdowns a game , the Seahawks are 17-1 . Three or more ? They 're 6-0 . <p> Still , there 's an art to goal-line running . In that highly contested parcel of the field , greats such as Barry Sanders were not part of the package . Alexander lives , trains and studies for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't see anything but the goal line , " says Jones , the 315-pound left tackle . " He knows where everybody is , where the unblocked guy is . " <p> And he 's ready to score at anytime . <p> " Shaun has great vision and the ability to react and make quick and decisive cuts and to run with good pad leverage , " says Mitchell , who rushed for 4,649 yards in a nine-year pro career . " He has a knack of being twice as powerful in the red zone as he is in the open field . " <p> And just as opportunistic . <p> " When he gets in the red zone , his hips are always pointing toward the goal line . He can be moving sideways and making people miss , but you watch him and he 's always able to accelerate quickly to the goal line , " Strong says . " That 's an amazing athletic quality he has . " <p> Becoming a team player <p> Given Alexander 's stardom at Alabama , his status as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early years with the Seahawks were sometimes a struggle for perspective . <p> Even last year , when he finished a yard short of tying Curtis Martin of the New York Jets for the NFL title , he said  --  in jest , he insists  --  he was " stabbed in the back " by coach Mike Holmgren , who called a quarterback sneak at the goal line instead of feeding Alexander the football . <p> " I see him taking the next step and ' I , I ' gets pushed by ' We , we . ' He has matured as a person , " Holmgren says . <p> " I think in his college career there was so much adulation and stuff . Then you come into this league and you might get coached harder or the language might be bad . And up here it 's kind of rough sometimes and so it 's a learning thing . And I see him maturing . He 's a married man , he has kids and I think there is a correlation between all of that and his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , married since 2002 , are the parents of Heaven , 2 , and Tiffany , 5 months . Heaven was born on a game day in 2003 , with Alexander assisting at his wife 's side in the hospital . He then hurried to Qwest Field in time for the second quarter and rushed for 58 yards in a 24-23 victory against the St.Louis Rams . It is the only start he has missed in the last four seasons . <p> But more than family moves him . <p> " It 's strictly my faith . My belief in Jesus Christ is really simple . Every day I wake up and try to honor him and try to get closer to him , and after that , everything falls back into place , " Alexander says . <p> " How do you honor the Lord with football ? Well , it 's just doing the best you can . How do you honor the Lord with your family ? Well , you try to be the best husband and father you can . Usually , people that have tempers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try not to think about myself . " <p> The Seahawks are family , too . So Alexander 's pursuits , which bring so many accolades , must be cast as group efforts . <p> " How can you really be happy if you 're only going after your own selfish motives ? That would be miserable for me , " he says . " It 's OK to be the best and think like you 're going to be the best . It 's not arrogant to say we 're going to be the best and I 'm going to do everything I have to to get everyone there . It 's arrogant and it 's all out of whack when it 's only about what you do whether you win or lose . " <p> Alexander treated the rushing title as a team achievement , not a one-man show , and most recently rewarded his linemen with portable DVD players . He 's cooking up another gift to show his thanks , and they 've shown theirs . Now that they 're in the playoffs , the Seahawks elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , end Grant Wistrom ( defense ) and the weekly special-teams ' designee . <p> It 's Alexander . <p> " That 's from his teammates , " Holmgren says . " And he did n't get elected because he gained 1,880 yards . " <p> But for all the things he is.
