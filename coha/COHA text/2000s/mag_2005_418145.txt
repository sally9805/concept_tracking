What 's eating you about feeding your child ? We took your questions to the experts and got advice that 's easy to swallow // Q My four-month-old son has been eating cereal for a month , but he is now refusing to eat any strained fruit . How can I make sure he is getting the balanced diet he needs ? A Your baby 's rapid growth can be sustained for about six months on breastmilk or formula alone . I can not tell you how many babies are started on solids at three or four months old because of some misconception that the baby is hungry or not fat enough . Babies , like adults , have variable levels of hunger . However , in these early months , this hunger should be satisfied by increased milk feedings . Starting solids too early may actually interfere with growth . I So do n't worry about your baby refusing fruit at four months of age . He does n't need it . At this age , tareastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula already provides your son with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop pureing and starj giving my child cut-up table food ? A Generally children can manage increasingly chunky foods near the end of their first year . Try experimenting with less pured foods and see how he manages . An older baby 's gums are very strong and having teeth is not a prerequisite for chunky foods . Start with soft cut-up foods , such as small banana pieces , mashed potatoes and other table food . As his fine motor skills improve , including his eye-hand coordination , he will likely start to enjoy finger foods like small cereals , rice , pasta , soft vegetables and fruits which he can feed himself . Children often want to try using their own spoon and cup as well around this time . - Sarah Liddell Q At what age can you give your child meat and dairy products ? My baby is six months old . A At about six months , iron needs increase and cereal is introduced for that purpose . After your baby is doing well with cereal ( this takes about a month ) , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch for any bad reaction , such as rashes around the mouth or diaper area . Over six to eight weeks , introduce three or four vegetables . Once these first few vegetables are in place , try a meat , such as chicken , veal or lamb , or tofu . After meats , introduce fruits before dairy products . You can introduce your baby to whole milk at around 10 months of age . Whole milk products can also be introduced to a breastfed baby around this time . - Diane Sucks Q My seven-month-old is not eating solids well . Should I be worried ? A At his age , most needed nutrients can be obtained from breastmilk with vitamin D supplementation or formula . The exception is iron . If your baby continues to refuse iron-fortified solids after a few months of trying , consult with your doctor about iron supplementation . The other reason to introduce food at about six months is to ensure that they become comfortable with different textures of food , so that they can obtain enough nutrients and calories when solids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't force your baby to take solids , but take a few days off and retry the same food or try something new . Stay calm and do n't turn this into a power struggle because you want your baby to have positive associations with eating . Remember that you have a fair amount of time to ease your baby into solids . - Diane Sacks Q How much cereal should my 10-month-old daughter be eating ? Are four to six tablespoons per meal OK ? A Iron-fortified cereal is important during your child 's first two years because few foods provide as much of this important nutrient . More than 30 percent of infants and toddlers in Canada are iron deficient . Depending on the type of milk your baby drinks , iron needs vary . That said , if your baby is eating four to six tablespoons of cereal three times a day , she 's probably getting plenty of iron . But the composition of infant cereals varies , so check the labels ; look for a cereal that meets 100 percent of your baby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron for one day . Also look for : * no hydrogenated oil to avoid any trace of trans fats , which are the bad fats ; * organic whole grains such as brown rice , oatmeal , barley or a mix of organic whole grains . * Louise Lambert-Lagac Q Is 18 ounces of homo milk too much for my 12-month-old ? He also drinks apple juice once or twice a day . A Your 12-month-old baby is doing just fine with 18 ounces of pasteurized whole milk a day . This is both the right type of milk for his age and the appropriate amount . Partly skim and skim milk , are not recommended before age two because they are short of essential fatty acids and provide insufficient energy . The role of fruit juice in your infant 's diet is another matter . Too much juice can displace the intake of milk and more nutritious foods . It can also cause diarrhea in some babies . Some studies have even linked juice intake to excessive weight gain as well as dental caries , . Your baby can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice . A good idea is to dilute it with water for extra fluid and reduced sweetness. - Lousie Lambert-Lagac Q My 13-month-old suddenly seems less hungry than he used to be . Should I be worried ? A Parents are often surprised and worried when they notice their one-year-old seems suddenly less interested in food . The transition to new textured table foods and the marked decrease in physical growth that occurs at this age result in an unpredictable appetite and fussy eating . Remember that your child is now growing slowly and in spurts compared with the intensive growth of his first 12 months . Never force your child to eat . The most effective attitude is one of respect and indifference - hard to apply , but efficient in the long run . Continue to offer your child healthy food choices that 's your job . His job is to eat according to his own appetite . - Louise Lambert-Lagac Q My two-year-old refuses to eat meat and vegetables . He eats macaroni , cheese sandwiches and some fruit . What should I do ? A Feeding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with meat and vegetables at the top of the list . Meat is most often refused because it takes more chewing . Meat mainly provides protein and iron , two important nutrients for a child 's normal development . Cheese and cheese dishesB provide protein , but are very low in iron . Try minced meats in pasta sauces , meat loaves , minced chicken , tofu or mashed chickpeas , which are easier to chew . To increase his iron intake , make sure your child eats iron-fortified cereal ( dry or cooked ) every day . Vegetables add vitamins , minerals and fibre , and help prevent constipation . Raw vegetables are often more acceptable than cooked ones especially when served with a dip . Try partially cooked carrots and zucchini with a yogurt dip . Finely shredded cabbage or carrot salads are likeable items . You can also offer vegetable juices or soups , but ' remember that they are low in fibre . If the vegetable route becomes a dead end , compensate by offering vitamin-rich fruit , such as oranges , melons , kiwis , mangoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offer small servings and never insist . And never give up . - Louise Lambert-Lagac Q My 2-year-old barely touches his meals , but likes to eat snacks constantly . How can I get I ? him to eat his meals ? A Children have small stomachs and generally do need more frequent meals and snacks than adults . This can lead to lots of grazing . Try instead to keep to a regular meal-and-snack schedule to help your child establish good eating routines . Offering a healthy variety of snacks can help your child establish good eating habits and might make you feel better if he does n't eat his meal . - Sarah Liddell PANEL OF EXPERTS Louise Lambert-Lagac is a Consulting dietitian and author of Feeding Your Baby the Healthiest Foods ( Fitzhenry &; Whiteside 2000 ) .
