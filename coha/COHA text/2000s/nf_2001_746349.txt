Physician-patient discourse , even same-language discourse , may be viewed as a type of crosscultural interaction . Inside the US , there is a large and increasing number of adult Third World immigrant patients who do not speak English . For these patients the " cross-cultural " aspect of First World medical practice is underscored by the presence of the medical interpreter , who is herself faced with the task of negotiating both the content of utterances and also the cultural contexts from and into which these utterances are conveyed . Analysis shows that , through variable patterns of how and when utterances are interpreted , the interpreter functions , not as an " ally " of the patient nor as a neutral conveyer of propositions , but rather as a covert co-diagnostician and institutional gatekeeper . As one result , these patients are often seen as " passive " and " non-compliant " by physicians , with consequences for how care is delivered and for their treatment by the institutional State . <p> interpreting ; discourse analysis ; medical discourse ; cross-cultural discourse Introduction <p> In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of professional , hospital-based Spanish-English medical interpreters at a public hospital in Northern California . The focus of this research was to examine how the linguistic actions of hospital-based interpreters helped to shape the course and content of medical interactions , and to analyze how interpretation itself influenced the process of diagnosis and the delivery of care to nonEnglish speaking patients . Interpreted medical interactions are ubiquitous in American hospitals today . Yet very little has been said about exactly how interpreters function in medical discourses , under what conditions , to what effects , to what social or medical ends , and for what political , philosophical , or ideological reasons . These are the questions that frame , to a greater or lesser degree , the entirety of this article , although the greater pan of the analysis itself focuses on analysis of representative stretches of naturally-occurring interpreted discourse . <p> Specifically , I focus on the measurable effects of professional , hospital-based interpreters on stretches of discourse between Spanish-speaking patients and their non-Spanish speaking doctors . I examine the role of patient generated questions and the interpreter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These measures are taken to index a larger pattern of behavior on the part of the professional interpreters , in which they work in tandem with physicians to " keep interviews moving " and , consequently , to move non-English speaking patients quickly out the door . I want to make clear at the outset that the interpretation of medical discourse , indeed all discourse , is by no means a simple matter of linguistic conversion . In addition to reformulating the words and phrases uttered by conversational participants , professional hospital interpreters are engaged in the mediation of the social , personal , and institutional expectations and goals of participants in the medical interview . They also participate in the construction of an acceptable outcome for that interview based in their understanding of the requirements of institutional medical practice ( Davidson 1998 ; Wadensj 1998 ) . <p> The routine forms of interpretive practice that I witnessed and recorded through six months of daily observation were largely shaped by two competing mandates given to the interpreters working at " Riverview General Hospital . " These mandates were assimilated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview . The first mandate was an administrative order to interpret " all and only " what was said by patients and physicians , a request for exact interpretation . The second mandate resulted from time pressures felt by the clinicians themselves , and it was an implicit mandate to " keep patients on track . " This was to prevent interpreted interactions from taking too much time , or bogging down in what the colonial missionary Father Murillo , quoted in Rafael ( 1993 : 133 ) , called " a labyrinth without a clue . beset by digressions and non-sequiturs . " <p> In modern hospital practice , especially in public medical institutions , physicians are under enormous economic pressure to see as many patients as possible in as short a time as possible . Consequently , physicians expected interpreters to edit heavily what immigrant patients were saying , weeding out " irrelevant " details of non-medical nature . This order to keep interpreted interviews moving quickly is understandable in the light of the enormous number of non-English speaking patients treated at Riverview General : in 1993 , 53,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 133,000 , requested an interpreter . <p> The mandates ( " be accurate , " " be quick " ) were born , then , out of economic and demographic necessities , but their juxtaposition was only possible due to the underlying tensions between the " art " and " science " of medicine . Science requires only semantics , the conveyance of pure fact , whereas the " art " of medicine requires , not only an understanding of what is said , but what it means in context : in other words , the pragmatics of differential diagnosis . Interpreters are placed squarely in the middle of this internal debate , and are asked to act as purely semantic actors in an environment defined in large part by routinized pragmatic interpretations of the " true " medical meaning of patients ' verbal output . <p> Thus the problem that arises from the interpreter 's second mandate , that of keeping patients " on track , " is that selecting and editing verbal output in a medical context is a procedure involving the determination of relevance of proffered information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the process of diagnosis . ) Physicians , by asking interpreters to selectively interpret what was said , were instructing interpreters to act as pre-diagnosticians , without any of the requisite medical training or institutional authority to act on these diagnoses . <p> In addition , physicians were licensing interpreters to work almost wholly without constraint or oversight ; they were asking interpreters to covertly aid in diagnosing that specific segment of the patient population that does not speak any functional level of English . This segment is , at least in California , largely made up of recent immigrants , who frequently are beset by numerous institutional problems and who , by definition , can not on their own work to change the medical record in English . Thus recently immigrated patients who did not speak English received , in very real terms , a different form of medical treatment , one mediated by a hospital employee who was not a health-care provider and who frequently , in the name of speed , cut short their more difficult-to-identify ailments , than did those patients who could communicate directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous invisible power wielded by professional , hospital based interpreters to " capture or dominate modes of representation " ( Mehan 1996 : 253 ) between patients and physicians . More precisely , they participated in representation of patients to physicians , which in turn resulted in the development of a rather striking gatekeeping role for these professional interpreters ( Davidson 2000 ) . Background <p> Interpretation is always a contextual act . However , the interpretation of institutional ( for example , courtroom or hospital ) discourse is defined , at least in part , by the social and behavioral norms of the institution and by the overt , elaborated , institutionallydefined goals ( by no means the only goals ) of the client-provider interactions ( cf. Gibbons 1994 ; Schegloff 1992 ) . In addition to the importance of the institutional frame that surrounds the medical interaction for an analysis of cross-linguistic medical discourse , we must also be aware that , in many ways , even same-language medical discourse may itself be viewed as a form of cross-cultural discourse . The " voice of medicine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater or lesser degree , with the " voice of the lifeworld , " as represented by the patient ( Mishler 1984 ) . The conflict is by no means an even one , because medical discourse , like other forms of institutional discourses , is also asymmetric with respect to relative power of the conversational participants : clinicians judge patients ' physical and verbal signs for social and moral , as well as physical , relevance to diagnosis , while patients are locally ( institutionally ) powerless to judge physicians through a similarly critical lens , or to impose any form of real sanction through negative judgements . The result of these conflicts and asymmetries , it has been argued , is that , through the physician 's conversational ( and other ) practices , the emotional , economic , and intellectual impact of disease processes on patients ' lives are nullified as valid topics for discussion , and thus for treatment . At the same time , physicians ' treatment of patients and their diseases reifies both the nature of disease and the larger social context(s) within which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , Cicourel 1983 ; Foucault 1963 , 1979 ; Mishler 1984 ; West 1984 ; Wodak 1996 ; Waitzkin 1983 , 1991 ) . <p> If patients who speak the same language as their provider have a hard time communicating with their physician ( and indeed challenge the notion of what it means to speak " the same language " ) , patients who do not share a common language with their provider have an added " language barrier " that further impedes communication . Nearly all of the literature on medical interpretation reports that physicians and patients encounter nearinsurmountable problems in communicating effectively through interpreters ( Baker et al . 1996 ; Baker et al . 1998 ; Diaz-Duque 1989 ; Ebden et al . 1988 ; Erzinger 1991 ; Marcos and Trujillo 1984 ; Putsch 1985 ; Woloshin et al . 1995 ) . As difficult as interpreted medical interactions are , they are also becoming more common , and the patients who use interpreters tend to have more than language barriers to contend with when participating in institutional interactions . Inside the U.S. , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrant patients who do not speak English , and who require an interpreter when visiting the hospital . <p> For these patients the typical " cross-cultural " aspects of First-World medical practice , conversational or otherwise , is underscored not only by a relative gap in knowledge of how to access the medical care system and how to make sense of it once it has been entered into ( cf. Fadiman 1997 ) . It is also characterized by the frequent presence of a third party , the medical interpreter , who is faced with the task of negotiating , then , not only the content of utterances , but also the cultural contexts from and into which these utterances are conveyed . The recently immigrated patients for and with whom interpreters communicate in modern medical settings are required to negotiate , not only words , but worlds ( Haffner 1992 ; Juhel 1982 ; Kaufert and Koolage 1984 ; see also Hatim 1997 ; Hatim and Mason 1989 ) . All of the conversational participants in cross-linguistic medical interactions are required to make sense out of a difficult interaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and institutional contexts of these cross-linguistic interactions directly inform both her understanding of what she is being asked to accomplish through interpretation ( and why ) , and the conversational methods she utilizes to facilitate , and in some ways create , the discourse she mediates . <p> There are , of course , important differences in alignment between types of interpreters , and medical interactions involving same-and different language pairs of physicians and patients . The main difference , in a study of hospital interpretation , will be between interactions in which a random stranger is asked to interpret ( the " grab-the-janitor " school of interpretation ) , those in which family members are present and acting as interpreters , and those in which professional , hospital-based interpreters interpret . The first case is a widely-reported fact of modern hospital practice , justified only by the notion that some form of verbal communication is preferable to no communication at all , and , while interesting , is beyond the scope of this article . <p> A more relevant comparison , for this article , is between family member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreters will , almost by definition , be familiar with the patient , her concerns , and her social milieu ; the latter , the professional interpreters , are familiar with the hospital and its routines , and often know well the doctors with whom they are working on a daily basis . This difference , between intimate familiarity of the interpreter with the patient and her needs or with the hospital and its workings , creates markedly different cross-linguistic interactions , in which the alignment of the interpreter , and her ability or tendency to represent ( rather than echo ) one or the other of the parties to the discourse as a virtual stand-in . Family members who interpret are often assumed , in practice , to know what their familiar is thinking or feeling without even asking the patient in question ; likewise , as we shall see , hospital-based interpreters often step in and answer questions before they ever reach the physician . In the case of family-member interpreters , these differences of alignment are also often marked by the common generation-gap between adult immigrant patients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Subsequently family dynamics ( of shame , respect , and taboo ) are inserted into the structure of the medical interview ( cf. Vasquez et al . 1994 ) . <p> In this study I focus entirely on the role of professional , hospital based interpreters . They are paid by the hospital administrative staff and are thus answerable to the same ; they are provided to patients as a service that is frequently seen as an economic luxury ( compared , say , to the maintenance of the physical plant of a hospital , or the hiring of nursing staff ) ; and they work with almost no oversight . At Riverview General interpreters require the barest minimum of training , and must pass a vocabulary test of major medical terms : there is no training in the difficulties of cross-linguistic discourse , nor of how real-time consecutive interpretation may work to shape , and not just mirror , conversations . The result is that professional interpreters largely train themselves at Riverview , often with only the input of physicians to help them determine what good interpreting entails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view themselves as cultural and linguistic allies of the patients for whom they are interpreting ( Haffner 1992 ) , but , at least in the case of Spanish speaking patients in California , the interpreters were overwhelmingly urban , educated elites in their respective countries-of-origin ( Mexico and Central American nations ) ; the patients for whom they interpreted were overwhelmingly of rural backgrounds , with little formal education . In this context the alliance is hardly one of equals , given the disparities in status between the professional interpreter and her patients , in both their country of origin and in the United States . To the interpreters , the Spanish-speaking patients were not simply unable to speak English , they were pre-modern , unable to deal with the complexities of an admittedly Byzantine hospital organization . It is this difference that underlay the comment made to me by one interpreter that one group of patients were " like children , " who " left everything to God . " ( It is a cardinal sin in the context of bio-medical practices to invoke God , unless you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interpreter , the patients ' god should , and must be , the physician herself ) . In addition , further pressure on the alliance came from the fact that most of the patients for whom interpreters are needed require public assistance to pay for their services . They are thus lowest class citizens in a medical environment that bases rapid access to care on the ability to pay for care . <p> The following examination of interpreted medical interactions shows that , through variable patterns of how and when utterances are interpreted , the professional , hospital-based interpreter functions , not as an ally of the patient nor as a neutral conveyer of propositions , but rather as a covert co-diagnostician and institutional gatekeeper . The interpreter often protects the physician from challenge and denies the patient the opportunity to interpret for herself the physician 's understanding of her complaints . An added layer of institutional judgement is thus created , and this in turn creates additional problems for an already underserved patient population ; because interpreted patients are unable to speak for themselves , for example , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by physicians ( a selffulfilling prophecy ) , with significant consequences for how care is delivered , and for how their role within the institutionally-based state is defined . Explicating Transformation , or ( Briefly ) Interpreting Interpretation <p> One problem with any study of cross-linguistic medical encounters is that , in the context of medical practice , the term " interpretation " is used in a number of different , and contextually relevant , ways . These uses inform both the view of the interpreter 's role(s) in the discourse and also the interpreter 's view of herself within the context of the medical institution . In medical settings interpretation means something other than " oral translation " ; it is understood , by institutional insiders , that physicians interpret diseases and disease processes , which is the heart of the art of medicine . In hospitals the act of converting and rendering utterances from one language into ( roughly ) similar utterances in another is frequently called " translation " ( rather than interpretation ) for precisely this reason ; this distinction , however , between interpretation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a process of mere semantic conversion misses the fundamental similarities of the two processes and their underlying connection in the context of crosslinguistic medical discourse . For most physicians , then , the unmarked meaning of the term " interpretation " is not the process of linguistic conversion from one natural language to another , but is rather the process of conversion of natural linguistic and corporal data to signs having meaning within the constructed language of medicine . Medical interpreting is the process of deciphering physical and verbal signs , by passing them through a grid of medical signification , and re-analyzing them as symbols or symptoms of known disease processes or as irrelevant to such processes ( cf. Foucault 1963 ) . <p> Beyond these two related but certainly not identical readings of the term " interpretation " are the physicians ' interpretations of patient behavior that are cataloged for display in the patient 's chart , itself a document that requires significant interpretation to be understood ( cf. Garfinkel 1967 ; Pettinari 1988 ) . Physicians do not merely report the findings of medical interviews , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to record patient utterances are chosen to create distance between what is reported by patients ( that is , data prior to medical interpretation ) and what is found through medical examination and reasoning . Physicians do not trust patients ' reports implicitly , and take them as only one piece of evidence towards a medical conclusion . For example , a patient 's negative reply to a question will not be recorded in the chart directly , or taken at face value , but rather is reported as a " denial " of the question , as in : " patient denies tobacco use , " " patient denies chest pain . " Patients " deny " pain or the use of tobacco , but it is only physicians who can report with certainty that neither is indexed by the presence of certain physical responses , or chemicals in the blood or other tissues . <p> What is perhaps most complicated about any social analysis of medical interpretation ( meaning the conversion of utterances in cross-linguistic medical discourses ) , then , is that medical discourse is already an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interpretive on a broader level , and more generally still discourse requires active interpretation on the part of speakers and hearers to make sense of utterances in context as the discourse unfolds through time . For the purposes of this article , I will state simply that the analysis of interpretation ( or " oral translation " ) in medical settings is crucially informed by the notion that the process is one of interpreting an already interpretive form of institutional interaction ( cf. Davidson 1999 ) , and that it is precisely the dualinterpretive nature of the professional hospital interpreter 's role that makes her job both central to the discourse , and utterly complex . Data and Methods <p> The data I am reporting on come from six months of continuous ethnographic observation at Riverview General 's General Medicine Outpatient Clinic . During this time I observed over 100 patient visits , and observed while audiotaping fifty individual patient visits . From this latter group I selected twenty taped interactions , ten English-English and ten SpanishEnglish , for complete transcription and comparison . <p> The main findings were that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same-language interactions , they probably should have . In general , far less information was passed along between the patient and the physician in the presence of an interpreter than was exchanged in same-language interactions , and in same-language interactions a higher proportion of patient complaints were recognizably diagnosed through the course of the interview . This was partly , and perhaps largely , due to the interpreter 's selective deletion of patients ' comments that were considered " non-medical " in nature , but which in and of themselves formed the context within which patient complaints could be most usefully analyzed . I now want to turn to an analysis of exactly how the conversational waters became so muddied through the interpreters ' actions . Questions in Medical Interviews <p> The importance of direct questions in medical interviews has been noted by a large number of scholars of medical discourse ( Ainsworth-Vaughn 1994 ; Frankel 1990 ; Mishler 1984 ; Robins and Wolfe 1988 ; West 1984 ; Wodak 1996 , for example ) . Mishler ( 1984 : 62-63 ) writes : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The large number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of those questions , is seen to provide proof that it is physicians who determine what will be talked about and for how long . Patients are merely there to provide the initial problem to be resolved and subsequent verbal confirmation of physical findings . Ainsworth-Vaughn ( 1994 ) states that patients generally do not ask direct questions of their physicians because such questions threaten the power roles defined by the institutional setting of the hospital clinic , and as such are potentially dangerous forms of resistance , and noteworthy when they occur . <p> What , then , is the nature and importance of those small number of questions that patients do ask their physicians ? Questions not only challenge the physician 's institutional authority ; they challenge the image of the patient as a passive undergoer of treatment . A number of physicians I have interviewed have stated that , regardless of what types of questions patients ask , they take note of the number they ask , because it gives an indication of how involved in their own care patients want to become . The patient 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in their own condition to the physician . <p> In Table I we see the numbers of direct questions asked by English speaking patients in the ten English-English visits analyzed . Some patients asked only a few questions , and only one asked a relatively large number of fourteen ; in almost all cases the questions elicited an identifiable direct response , either immediately or at some point later in the medical interview : <p> The data show that , regardless of the time elapsed between question and answer ( cf. West 1984 ) , virtually all of the English-speaking patients ' questions were provided some form of an identifiable answer . The two questions that were not answered were requests for confirmation of what had just been said , or questions asked in order to display comprehension of a prior utterance , and neither was a request for a diagnosis or clarification of important clinical information . <p> For Spanish speaking patients , however , the story was somewhat different : questions were answered , but for over half of the questions asked , they were answered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a question had been asked and subsequently answered : <p> It is here that the interpreter 's role as intermediary and co-clinician comes into relief . Fewer than half of all direct questions asked by Spanish-speaking patients were passed along to the physician , which makes the relatively low number of questions asked by these patients appear even lower . Judging by what the interpreters said , physicians could gather that Spanish-speaking patients asked , on average , about 1.5 questions per visit . <p> Hispanic patients are often seen as passive by the physicians who treat them ; analyses of this phenomenon have cited notions of " respeto , " or lack of " acculturation " to the U.S. health care system ( Blackball et al . 1995 ; Erzinger 1991 ; Marcos and Trujillo 1984 ; Phillips et al . 1996 ; Solis et al . 1990 , for example ) . While it is clear that differing notions of what good patient or physician behavior entails influences greatly the course and outcome of medical interactions , I will argue here , however , that one contributing factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least partly due to the fact that the majority of the questions they ask simply never reach the physician . If one takes seriously the notion that physicians key in to how many questions are asked of them as a raw index of the patient 's interest in his or her own health , patients speaking through a Spanish interpreter would seem to be quite uninterested in getting involved in their own health-care . <p> Many of the questions asked by Spanishspeaking patients did , however , receive an answer , and it could be argued that there is little harm , at least harm that can be empirically measured , in the interpreter answering a question to which she knows she has the right answer . It should be noted , then , that not only did Spanish-speaking patients not ask many questions , but that the questions that did not receive any answer were not randomly distributed as to content . <p> In visit 46 , for example , an elderly Mexican woman with diabetes and hypertension was undergoing a routine examination . As Table 2 shows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview , almost the identical number asked , on average , by the English speaking patients studied . For four of her questions she received an answer , one from the physician and three from the interpreter . It is first important to note , then , that of five questions asked by this patient , the physician heard only one ; in effect the interpreter has removed the patient 's potential challenges effectively from within the discourse before they ever reached the physician 's ears . <p> More importantly , the one question that was not answered , acknowledged , or passed on to the physician by the interpreter was a request for information regarding the process of diagnosis itself , which can be seen in Excerpt 1 . At this point in the interview the patient had mentioned that she thought perhaps her blood sugars were responsible for a new series of ailments , to which the physician , in the parlance of the clinic , denies the possibility of the connection : <p> Excerpt 1 ( from visit 46 ) : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> What we see is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unambiguous question , and that the question does not receive any form of recognizable reply . The issue at this point is not merely that a question was asked and ignored , but rather that the question itself was the only one asked by this patient that was not closed . It asked , not for a discrete piece of information such as the location of a referral clinic or the correct dosage of a medication , but rather for an accounting of how the interpreter came to tell her that " it 's probably not the problem . " <p> There are two possible interpretations of the patient 's question itself : either she is asking for an explanation of the process by which the two medical conditions which were in her opinion linked causally were determined to be unrelated , that is , she is asking to be educated as to the process of diagnosis which just took place ; or she is asking the interpreter herself how she came to the conclusion that the link was non-existent , meaning the patient is asking the interpreter where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In either case , the patient is doing exactly what physicians at Riverview generally claimed Spanish-speaking patients did not do , which is taking an active interest in the process of diagnosis and the medical interview itself . That the physician never heard this or the other three questions raises serious issues about to the true nature of the role of the interpreter with regards to the patient 's restricted ability to express herself fully within the institutional setting . Hospital Interpreting in the Modern Institution of the Hospital Clinic <p> The interpreters ' actions regarding the patients ' direct questions need to be analyzed within the larger context of the role of interpreters in mediating cross-linguistic and cross-cultural discourse within the institution of the hospital clinic . I have only shown the details of one aspect of how interpreters work at Riverview General , but the data fit a pattern that was well established by the larger analysis presented in Davidson ( 1998 ) . The interpreter acts , not as a neutral agent nor , as Haffner ( 1992 ) claims , as an " advocate " of patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacit coordination with the physician as an additional gatekeeper within the medical interview , a second institutional agent that remains to be convinced by the institution 's clients , in this case recently-immigrated patients from Third World countries , that their concerns are important enough to be addressed and resolved by the means at the institution 's disposal . It is not simply that interpreters are not conveying questions or giving an incomplete accounting of what has been said in the name of the physician or patient . It is rather that interpreters are acting in a patterned way to exclude from the discourse those topics that are deemed unmedical and thus outside of the scope of responsibilities that they , as employees of the hospital , will assume . <p> The data from this study have frequently elicited the commentary that these interpreters are simply not doing their job , and that any attempt to explain their actions by turning to the institutional context and constraints within which they are working is nothing more than an elaborate apology for easily identified omissions . The case is not that simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their obligation to represent fairly each of the interlocutors in the speech event in question . Their actions make perfect sense , however , when we look at the institution of the hospital as a whole . Not only is it a place where people with medical problems receive medical care , it is also one of the places where citizens of the large and diffuse modem state come to learn about their role and place within that state , a notion elaborated by Foucault ( 1979 : 304 ) : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> All that is needed to make this quote perfectly relevant to the analysis at hand is to add the words " the society of the interpreter judge , " for it is interpreters with whom and through whom recent immigrants interact with institutions of the state . In this light the actions of the interpreters at Riverview General are not those of untrained incompetents , but rather agents of a state that has very little time for , and very few resources allocated to the care of , its most recent additions . <p> Those who see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who can not speak for themselves , the potential for an ally in dealing with the confusing expectations and rituals of medical care in a foreign land , will see in this analysis the utter loss of an opportunity . But to say that these interpreters are behaving unethically is to excuse the physicians who encourage them to keep time spent in consultation to a minimum , and the administrators who allocate ridiculously small resources to an enormous problem ( remember that 40% of the patients at Riverview can not speak English ) . The problem is not that the interpreters at Riverview are acting unethically , but rather that they are working within the system of ethics as defined by the institution of the hospital clinic , not by the ethical system of the patients who are seeking services from that institution . <p> Patients at Riverview who do not speak English and who are provided with a hospital based interpreter must struggle , unlike than their Englishspeaking counterparts , to first have their voices represented , before they can then argue that what they are saying is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-level gatekeeper is only one of the ways in which immigrant populations are taught that their role in the English-speaking world is not that of a speaker or an equal interlocutor , but that of a passive recipient of whatever care it has been determined that they are in need of , without great consultation or discussion as to their real needs or concerns .
