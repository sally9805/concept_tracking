1 It was one of those chilly , foggy days that masquerade as summer in northern California , as the wind whipped across the long crescent of beach , and whisk-broomed a cloud of fine sand into the air . A little girl in red shorts and a white sweatshirt walked slowly down the beach , with her head turned against the wind , as her dog sniffed at seaweed at the water 's edge . The little girl had short curly red hair , amber-flecked honey-colored eyes , and a dusting of freckles across her face , and those who knew children would have guessed her to be somewhere between ten and twelve . She was graceful and small , with skinny little legs . And the dog was a chocolate Lab . They walked slowly down from the gated community toward the public beach at the far end . There was almost no one on the beach that day , it was too cold . But she did n't mind , and the dog barked from time to time at the little swirls of sand raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water 's edge . He leaped backward , barking furiously , when he saw a crab , and the little girl laughed . It was obvious that the child and the dog were good friends . Something about the way they walked along together suggested a solitary life , as though one could sense that they had walked along this way often before . They walked side by side for a long time . Some days it was hot and sunny on the beach , as one would expect in July , but not always . When the fog came in , it always seemed wintry and cold . You could see the fog roll in across the waves , and straight through the spires of the Golden Gate . At times you could see the bridge from the beach . Safe Harbour was thirty-five minutes north of San Francisco , and more than half ofit was a gated community , with houses sitting just behind the dune , all along the beach . A security booth with a guard kept out the unwelcome . There was no access to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the other end , there was a public beach , and a row of simpler , almost shacklike houses , which had access to the beach as well . On hot sunny days , the public beach was crowded and populated inch by inch . But most of the time , even the public beach was sparsely visited , and at the private end , it was rare to see anyone on the beach at all . The child had just reached the stretch of beach where the simpler houses were , when she saw a man sitting on a folding stool , painting a watercolor propped against an easel . She stopped and watched him from a considerable distance , as the Lab loped up the dune to pursue an intriguing scent he seemed to have discovered on the wind . The little girl sat down on the sand far from the artist , watching him work . And she was far enough away that he was not aware of her at all . She just liked watching him , there was something solid and familiar about him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked observing people , and did the same thing with fishermen sometimes , staying well away from them , but taking in all they did . She sat there for a long time , as the artist worked . And she noticed that there were boats in his painting that did n't exist . It was quite a while before the dog came back and sat down next to her on the sand . She stroked him , without looking at him , she was looking out to sea , and then from time to time at the man . After a while , she stood up and approached a little bit , standing behind him and to the side , so he remained unaware of her presence , but she had a clear view of his work in progress . She liked the colors he was working with , and there was a sunset in the painting that she liked as well . The dog was tired by then , and stood by , seeming to wait for a command . And it was yet another little while before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice her at last . He looked up , startled , as the dog bounded past him , sending up a spray of sand . It was only then that the man glanced up and saw the child . He said nothing , and went on working , and was surprised to notice that she had n't moved , and was still watching him , when he turned his head again , and mixed some water in his paints . They said nothing to each other , but she continued to watch , and finally sat down on the sand . It was warmer , keeping low in the wind . Like her , the artist was wearing a sweatshirt , and in his case jeans , and an old pair of deck shoes that were well worn . He had a gently weathered face and a deep tan , and she noticed as he worked that he had nice hands . He was roughly the same age as her father , in his forties somewhere . And as he turned to see if she was still there , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to a child in a long time . " Do you like to draw ? " He could n't imagine any other reason why she 'd still be there , except if she were an aspiring artist . She would have been bored otherwise . In truth , she just liked the silent companionship of being close to someone , even a stranger . It seemed friendly somehow . " Sometimes . " She was cautious with him . He was , after all , a stranger , and she knew the rules about that . " What do you like to draw ? " he asked , cleaning a brush , and looking down at it as he talked . He had a handsome , chiseled face , and a cleft chin . There was something quiet and powerful about him , with broad shoulders and long legs . And in spite of sitting on the artist 's stool , you could see he was a tall man . " I like to draw my dog . How do you draw the boats if they are n't there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their eyes met again . " I imagine them . Would you like to try ? " He held out a small sketch pad and a pencil , it was obvious that she was n't going anywhere . She hesitated , and then stood up , walked toward him , and took the pencil and pad . " Can I draw my dog ? " Her delicate face was serious as she inquired . She felt honored that he had offered her the pad . " Sure . You can draw anything you like . " They did n't exchange names , but just sat near each other for a time , as each worked . She looked intent as she labored on the drawing . " What 's his name ? " the artist inquired as the Lab sailed past them , chasing birds . " Mousse , " she said , without raising her eyes from her drawing . " He does n't look much like a moose . But it 's a good name , " he said , correcting something on his own work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dessert . It 's French , and it 's chocolate . " " I guess that 'll work , " he said , looking satisfied again . He was almost through for the day . It was after four o'clock and he 'd been there since lunchtime . " Do you speak French ? " he said , more for something to say than out of any real interest , and was surprised when she nodded . It had been years since he 'd spoken to a child her age , and he was n't sure what he should say to her . But she had been so tenacious in her silent presence . And he noticed , as he glanced at her , that aside from the red hair , she looked a little like his daughter . Vanessa had had long straight blond hair at that age , but there was something similar about the demeanor and the posture . If he squinted , he could almost see her . " My mom 's French , " she added , as she sat , observing her own work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she drew Mousse -- the back legs did n't come out right . " Let 's take a look , " he said , holding a hand out for the sketch pad , aware of her consternation . " I can never do the back part , " she said , handing it to him . They were like master and student , the drawing creating an instant bond between them . And she seemed strangely comfortable with him . " I 'll show you . . . . May I ? " he asked her permission before adding to her efforts , and she nodded . And with careful strokes of the pencil , he corrected the problem . It was actually a very creditable portrait of the dog , even before he improved it . " You did a good job , " he observed , as he handed the page back to her and put away his sketch pad and pencil . " Thank you for fixing it . I never know how to do that part . " " You 'll know next time , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting colder , but neither of them seemed to notice . " Are you going home now ? " She looked disappointed , and it struck him as he looked into the cognac-colored eyes that she was lonely , and it touched him . Something about her haunted him . " It 's getting late . " And the fog on the waves was getting thicker . " Do you live here , or are you just visiting ? " Neither knew the other 's name , but it did n't seem to matter . " I 'm here for the summer . " There was no excitement in her voice , and she smiled seldom . He could n't help wondering about her . She had crept into his afternoon , and now there was an odd , undefinable link between them . " At the gated end ? " He assumed she had come from the north end of the beach , and she nodded . " Do you live here ? " she asked , and he gestured with his head in the direction of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist ? " " I guess so . So are you , " he smiled , glancing at the portrait of Mousse she was holding tightly . Neither of them seemed to want to leave , but they knew they had to . She had to get home before her mother did , or she 'd get in trouble . She had escaped the baby-sitter who 'd been talking for hours on the phone with her boyfriend . The child knew that the teenaged baby-sitter never cared if she went wandering off . Most of the time she did n't even notice , until the child 's mother came home and asked about her . " My father used to draw too . " He noticed the " used to , " but was n't sure if it meant that her father no longer drew , or had left them . He suspected the latter . She was probably a child from a broken home , hungry for male attention . None of that was unfamiliar to him . " Is he an artist ? " " No , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , with a sigh , she looked at him sadly . " I guess I 'd better go home now . " And as though on cue , Mousse reappeared and stood beside her . " Maybe I 'll see you again sometime . " It was early July , and there was still a lot of life left in the summer . But he had never seen her before , and suspected she did n't come down this way very often . It was a good distance for her . " Thank you for letting me draw with you , " she said politely , a smile dancing in her eyes this time , and the wistfulness he saw there touched him profoundly . " I liked it , " he said honestly , and then stuck a hand out to her , feeling somewhat awkward . " My name is Matthew Bowles , by the way . " She shook his hand solemnly , and he was impressed by her poise and good manners . She was a remarkable little soul , and he was glad to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's an interesting name . Pip ? Is that short for something ? " " Yes . I hate it , " she giggled , seeming more her own age again . " Phillippa . I was named after my grandfather . Is n't it awful ? " She screwed up her face in disdain for her own name , and it elicited a smile from him . She was irresistible , particularly with the curly red hair and the freckles , all of which delighted him . He was n't even sure anymore if he liked children . He generally avoided them . But this one was different . There was something magical about her . " Actually , I like it . Phillippa . Maybe one day you 'll like it . " " I do n't think so . It 's a stupid name . I like Pip better . " " I 'll remember that when I see you next time , " he said , smiling at her . They seemed to be lingering , reluctant to leave each other . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Maybe Thursday . " He had the distinct impression , given what she said , that she had either sneaked out or slipped away unnoticed , but at least she had the dog with her . Suddenly , for no reason he could think of , he felt responsible for her . He folded his stool then , and picked up the worn , battered box he kept his paints in . He put the folded easel under one arm , and they stood looking at each other for a long moment . " Thank you again , Mr. Bowles . " " Matt . Thank you for the visit . Good-bye , Pip , " he said almost sadly . " Bye , " she said with a wave , and then danced away like a leaf on the wind , as she waved again , and ran up the beach with Mousse behind her . He stood watching her for a long time , wondering if he 'd ever see her again , or if it mattered . She was only a child after all . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked up the dune to his small weather-beaten cottage . He never locked the door , and when he walked inside and set his things down in the kitchen , he felt an ache he had n't felt in years and did n't welcome . That was the trouble with children , he told himself , as he poured himself a glass of wine . They crept right into your soul , like a splinter under a fingernail , and then it hurt like hell when you removed them . But maybe it was worth it . There was something exceptional about her , and as he thought of the little girl on the beach , his eyes drifted to the portrait he had painted years before of a girl who looked remarkably like her . It was his daughter Vanessa when she was roughly the same age . And with that , he walked into his living room , and sank heavily into an old battered leather chair , and looked out at the fog rolling in over the ocean . And as he stared at it , all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl with bright red curly hair and freckles , and the haunting cognac-colored eyes . 2 Ophelie Mackenzie took the last winding turn in the road , and drove the station wagon slowly through the tiny town of Safe Harbour . The town consisted of two restaurants , a bookstore , a surf shop , a grocery store , and an art gallery . It had been an arduous afternoon in the city for her . She hated going to the group twice a week , but she had to admit that it helped her . She had been going to it since June , and had another three months ahead of her . She had even agreed to attend meetings over the summer , which was why she had left Pip with their neighbor 's daughter . Amy was sixteen , liked to baby-sit , or so she claimed , and needed the money to supplement her allowance . Ophelie needed the help , and Pip seemed to like her . It was a comfortable arrangement for all concerned , although Ophelie hated driving into town twice a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty minutes at most . As commutes went , aside from the ten-mile stretch of hairpin turns between the freeway and the beach , it was easy . And driving along the cliffs , on the winding road , looking out over the ocean relaxed her . But this afternoon she was tired . It was exhausting sometimes listening to the others , and her own problems had n't improved much since October . If anything , it seemed to be getting harder . But at least she had the support of the group , it was someone to talk to . And when she needed to , she could let her hair down with them , and admit how rotten she was feeling . She did n't like burdening Pip with her troubles . It did n't seem fair to do that to a child of eleven .
