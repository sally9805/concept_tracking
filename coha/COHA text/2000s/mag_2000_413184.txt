Three hundred years ago , Swedish troops under King Karl XII assaulted a superior number of Russians who occupied entrenched positions-and established their teenaged monarch 's reputation as the " Madman of the North .

The czar 's interest in naval matters led him to challenge Swedish dominance of the Baltic Sea . // At the beginning of the 18th century , two of Europe 's greatest monarchs were to clash in what became known as the Great Northern War . One , Czar Peter I of Russia , had ambitions of transforming his backward country into a modem European power . The other , Karl ( or Charles ) XII of Sweden , was only 15 when he ascended the throne of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fought his first major battle with Peter 's Russians at Narva . That battle would determine the course of the war for years to come . It would also set Karl on a path to glory and ultimate doom . Born in 1672 , Czar Peter I-later to be known as " Peter the Great " - became notorious from an early age for his limitless energy , capacity for drink and absorption in military affairs , together with a contempt for religious and ceremonial protocol . In 1695 Peter launched a war against the Ottoman Empire , in which he served as a humble artilleryman . His first campaign was a failure , but after building a riverine fleet and increasing his army 's strength to 75,000 men , Peter succeeded in capturing Azov on July 28 , 1696 . In the following year , Peter set off for Western Europe , traveling incognito with a diplomatic mission that was seeking allies against the Turks . He passed through Germany , the Netherlands , Britain and Austria over the course of 16 months , and during that time he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . Peter hired thousands of Western European technicians and artisans to work in Russia before hastening home in 1698 , when the old traditional guardsmen , the Streltsy musketeers , revolted against their reformist czar . After crushing the revolt-with the aid of a Scottish general , Patrick Gordon-Peter accused his czarina of treachery and sent her into exile . He then proceeded to offend conservative sensibilities by insisting on the widespread adoption of Western dress , customs and styles in Russia . Although Azov was of little strategic value , the manner in which he seized it impressed Peter with the importance of naval power . That and his tour of Europe set his sights on the Baltic Sea , which was then dominated by Sweden . When King Karl XI of Sweden died on April 5 , 1697 , and the Swedish regency was cut short by the accession of 15-year-old Karl XII to the throne in November , Peter saw an opportunity . During 1698-99 , he entered into a secret alliance against Sweden with King Frederick IV of Denmark and with Augustus II ( the Strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elector of Saxony . After negotiating a 30-year armistice with the Ottoman Empire in 1700 , Peter felt ready to break Sweden 's control of the Baltic .

Below : Peter the Great at Deptford Dockyard , by Daniel Maclise . The czar 's interest in naval matters led him to challenge Swedish dominance of the Baltic Sea . // It was , however , no ordinary youth who had ascended the Swedish throne . At first Karl XII was anxious to avoid conflict , but the Danish invasion of Schleswig and the defeat of Karl 's ally , the Duke of HolsteinGottorp in April 1700 , followed in June by a PolishSaxon invasion of Livonia ( a region currently divided between Latvia and Estonia ) , left the Swedish king no choice but to mobilize his forces . When Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karl , barely 18 , boldly decided to take the offensive . Ignoring the advice of his own admiral-in-chief , he sailed across supposedly unnavigable waters with the assistance of an Anglo-Dutch squadron under Sir George Rooke and invaded Zealand on August 4 . When Karl attacked Copenhagen , the Danes precipitately sued for peace . In the Treaty of Travendal of August 28 , 1700 , Schleswig was returned to the Duke of HolsteinGottorp and Denmark agreed to stay out of the war . Karl intended to deal with Augustus next , but he had to change his plans when news arrived on August 24 that Russian troops had invaded Ingria . Peter 's purpose in attacking Sweden was to seize the Baltic provinces of Ingria ( in which he would later build the port of St. Petersburg ) and Karelia , now the border region between Russia and eastern Finland . Narva , a coastal fortress on the border between Estonia and Ingria , was not among his original war aims , since it was part of the territory designated to go to Poland . Nevertheless , Peter felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it lay only 20 miles from the Russian frontier . On October 4 , 40,000 Russians appeared before Narva 's small garrison , which was under the command of Colonel Henning Rudolf Horn . After an initial attempt to storm the fortress failed , the Russians settled in to invest it . Directed by Saxon Lt. Gen. Ludwig von Hallart , the siege proceeded much more slowly than Peter had hoped . Although close to the frontier , Narva was more than 100 miles from the nearest Russian cities . And the hopelessly inadequate roads , made worse by torrential autumn rains , prevented everything from being in position before the end of October . The bombardment of Narva finally commenced on November 4 , while 5,000 cavalry under Field Marshal Boris Schermetyev were dispatched to the west to guard against any Swedish relief effort . For two weeks , the Russian guns pounded away , but the garrison managed to repulse two infantry assaults , and eventually the Russians ran low on ammunition . While awaiting resupply , Peter received two very disturbing reports : Augustus had abandoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pernau , 150 miles away from Narva . Having intended to fight Augustus , Karl was deeply disappointed to learn that his enemy had shrewdly withdrawn his forces in reaction to Denmark 's cessation of hostilities . Karl was , however , determined to fight someone and began concentrating forces as rapidly as possible , drilling those with him at Wesenberg . Many of his soldiers were less than enthusiastic about winter campaigning against the Russians-rumored to number 80,000 men-who had established fortified defensive positions around Narva . Karl was determined to relieve the city , however , and on November 13 , he set out with 10,537 men . Conditions were every bit as bad as Karl had been warned . The rain soaked everything , there was no fodder for the horses and the men could count on no rations beyond what they carried . Karl slept in the open with his soldiers , and temperatures at night were already below freezing . Fortunately for him there was little opposition except at the last of the three passes they had to negotiate between Pernau and Narva . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far side ofthe stream , but he did not destroy the bridge . Karl brought up eight horse artillery pieces and then led a detachment of dragoons and some Royal Guards , in total no more than 400 men , in a charge that screened the Swedish guns until they were unmasked at close range . When they opened fire , the startled Russians wheeled and galloped away , leaving the pass open . In fact , Schermetyev had specific orders not to stand and fight , but the Swedes took great heart from this episode . Had the pass been defended , it could have cost them dearly . On the following evening , with the Swedes drenched and covered in mud , a signal from Karl 's guns drew four dull thuds of return fire from Narva , indicating that the fortress was still in Swedish hands . Meanwhile , Schermetyev arrived back in the main Russian camp to report that Karl 's relief force was close behind . Peter summoned Charles Eugene , duc du Croy , an aging nobleman from the Spanish Netherlands who had accompanied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to take command . Meanwhile , he and Fyodor Golovin , the nominal Russian commander in chief ( and also foreign minister ) , would leave for Novgorod to arrange for reinforcements and consult with Augustus . Peter was disappointed in Augustus-as well as suspicious of him . Some historians have accused Peter of cowardice for leaving Narva at that critical moment , but he demonstrated ample physical courage on too many occasions for such claims to be credible . Nevertheless , the speed of the Swedes ' arrival took Peter by surprise , and Schermetyev reported their numbers as " 30,000 , perhaps 32,000 , " which the czar had no reason to doubt . Hallart recounted with profound disgust that he saw Peter in du Croy 's tent " confused and half-mad , wailing and draining glass after glass of brandy , " and that the " howling and weeping by turns was shameful to see . " Perhaps . But Peter was the man upon whom all responsibility in Russia rested , and he was doing what he thought best . Peter apparently reasoned that 39,000 regularsmany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cavalry in defenses comprising a 6-foot ditch and a 9-foot rampart studded with 140 guns seemed secure enough . // Noting that their more numerous opponents were spread out over four miles of ramparts , Karl XII and General Carl Gustav Rehnskjold planned to penetrate the Russian defenses in two columns and then roll up their flanks . // Not surprisingly , du Croy did not share Peter 's optimism . The Russian forces were thinly spread along their blockade positions , and the Swedish soldiers might overwhelm one position before du Croy could bring up support . More significant , the nobleman did not speak Russian and was unfamiliar with the army 's staff . Given absolute power of command , he was left with written instructions to postpone a battle until more ammunition arrived , but to maintain the siege and prevent Karl 's relief force from breaking into the town . Nobody in the Russian camp had the slightest inkling of what was to happen next . Charles Eugene , duc du Croy , baron , margrave and prince of the Holy Roman Empire , had served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had been forced to resign when he had retreated before the Ottoman grand vizier 's enormous army . He had met Peter in 1698 during the latter 's visit to Amsterdam and offered his services , but the young czar declined them at the time . Du Croy was later engaged by Augustus , who had sent him to Peter in order to persuade the czar to supply 20,000 men to assist him with the reduction of Riga . Du Croy had stayed on with the Russians as an adviser when Peter embarked on his own campaign instead . Now du Croy suddenly found himself in command of the entire Russian force . At dawn on November 20 , the Swedish columns were mustered at Lagena and marched through the cold rain toward Narva . Du Croy , impressive in a red uniform and riding a gray horse , was conducting his morning inspection when the sound of musketry alerted him to the Swedish approach at about 10 a.m . He rode up in time to see the enemy emerging in raindrenched columns from a wood on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were approaching fortified earthworks , and in his experience , any assault would take time , developing gradually . The small size of the Swedish force was puzzling , though , and he wondered if it was merely the vanguard of a much larger army . It seemed prudent to send a portion of his own troops , perhaps 15,000 men , out to attack the Swedes and disrupt the advance , but he found the Russian officers disinclined to leave the protection of their lines . Consequently , he ordered his regiments to raise their colors on the earthworks , stand to and wait . Karl , meanwhile , surveyed the Russian positions from atop the Hermannsberg . The battlefield was spread out clearly below , bounded on both sides by the Narva River , which flowed in a wide curve around the town . He could see what appeared to be impressive defensive positions , with bastions and a rampart studded with chevaux de frise ( crossed stakes ) and an obviously much larger Russian force manning them . Karl and his principal general , Carl Gustav @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider desperate . Exhausted armies do not normally assault heavily fortified positions held by vastly superior numbers . But there was no alternative , and Karl and Rehnskjold noticed the same weakness that du Croy had pointed out to Peter-the Russians were spread along four miles of ramparts and would be less able to concentrate than the Swedes if the latter acted boldly . Bold action was exactly what Karl proposed , and he ordered Rehnskjold to prepare a plan . Photograph The two Swedish columns advance on the Russian trenches outside Narva on the of November 20 , 1700 , in a panorama that omits the snowstorm that gave the attackers an unexpected but most welcome added advantage . // Split into two divisions , the Swedish infantry would assault the earthworks toward the center of the line , and once they broke through , they would wheel left and right to roll up the defenses from within . The cavalry would remain outside the ramparts on either flank to deal with any sortie that might try to interfere with the main columns , or to escape . Rehnskjold himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right would be under Count Otto Vellinck , and Karl would command a small separate force with Colonels Magnus Stenbock and Arvid Horn . The Swedish artillery was deployed as quickly as possible and opened a bombardment on the center of the Russian line , while the infantry and cavalry formed up in their respective positions . Thus , 10,000 Swedes prepared to attack 40,000 Russians . Du Croy watched this drama unfold with growing alarm . Instead of digging their own ditches and establishing fortified camps , many of the Swedes , he saw , were carrying fascines . Gradually , the terrible truth dawned upon him-that the Swedes were indeed going to assault his lines . By 2 p.m. , the Swedes were ready . The rain had ceased , but the weather was turning colder and a new storm was gathering . Signal rockets soared , and then Swedish infantrymen began marching resolutely toward the Russian rampart with a blizzard blowing in behind them . Although some of their officers had sought to postpone the attack until the storm had abated , Karl cried : " No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's faces . " The king was right . The Russians were blinded by the near horizontal snow and fired their weapons high . The Swedes advanced silently and suddenly loomed out of the whiteout , a mere 30 paces from the Russian positions . At that point , the Swedish infantrymen calmly leveled their own weapons and fired a devastating volley that cut down the Russians on the rampart . Throwing their fascines into the ditch , the Swedes then swarmed across and flung themselves upon the stunned defenders with swords and their newly issued socket bayonets . " We charged directly sword in hand and so entered , " wrote Captain Olof Stiernhook afterward . " We slew all who came at us and it was a terrible massacre . " For a quarter of an hour , the Russians resisted ferociously . " They returned a heavy fire and killed many fine fellows ; Johan Bonde and Goran Ulfsparre were shot at my side , " wrote Stiemhook , who reported that he received no wound , except to be " pricked a little in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regiment , the resolute Swedish infantry created a breach through which they poured , dividing left and right precisely according to plan . The southern Swedish column wheeled to face the Streltsy regiments , which it routed easily , confirming Peter 's worst fears about their unsuitability for modem warfare . Golovin 's division , though without its commander , put up stout resistance initially , but first one and then another regiment began to give way . Schermetyev 's cavalry was stationed on the Russian left wing behind Golovin 's division and might have been able to intervene . But they were made up of noblemen and undisciplined Cossacks , and the latter panicked , turned and galloped headlong into the river to try and escape . Thousands of horses and at least 1,000 men were lost in the small cataracts . In the north , the story was similar . At first the Russians stoutly defended their earthworks . Then their officers were killed and they began to break , crying , " The Germans have betrayed us ! " The Swedish advance moved from bastion to bastion until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was the Russian army 's main supply route over the Narva River , were the pick of the Russian regiments , the Preobazhenski and Semenovski Guards and some dismounted dragoons . The fighting there was especially hard , and from that day until the demise of those regiments in 1917 , their officers on parade wore red tabs around their necks imprinted with the date of Narva , a distinction conferred upon them by Peter in recognition of their gallant stand . // Wisely leaving the actual execution of his battle plan to Generals Rehnskjold and Count Otto Vellinck , King Karl personally led a smaller force during the assault . By the time he got inside the Russian defenses , two horses had been shot from under him and he had lost a boot in the mud . // Hordes of Russian troops poured out of the ramparts trying to escape , only to be driven in again by the Swedish cavalry stationed outside . Before long , a dense welter of camp followers , wagoners and artillerymen , mixed with a herd of terrified soldiers , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged forward to cut off even that slender hope . Suddenly the bridge cracked and sagged under the weight of frightened humanity upon it , tumbling many into the icy waters below . Meanwhile , six Russian battalions , including the Guards regiments , under General Ivan Buturlin , had taken over a number of blockhouses and dugouts and lashed together a laager out of artillery and supply wagons . Around that improvised strongpoint , the bitterest fighting went on into the night . Elsewhere , the Russian army had been reduced to a fleeing rabble . The foreign officers found it impossible to control the situation , and Hallart complained bitterly that " they ran about like a herd of cattle . One regiment was mixed up with another so that hardly twenty men could be got into line . " Once the Russian soldiers began to cry out against their foreign officers , it was impossible to restore discipline , and du Croy declared that " the Devil could not fight with such soldiers . " Together with Hallart and Baron Langen , he dashed out in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedish guard than among his own terrified troops . Stenbock received his prisoners politely and took them to the king . Karl 's role in the action so far had been chiefly to enjoy himself-at no small risk . He had spent most of the afternoon outside the earthworks , exposing himself to danger , and he had lost a boot when pulled from a ditch after his horse was killed under him . He then remounted , only to have that horse also promptly killed , and he was hit by a spent musket ball that he later recovered from his necktie . He appeared inside the earthwork toward evening , still minus a boot and covered in mud . There , Karl learned that du Croy and many of the foreign officers had surrendered , but the Swedes were still outnumbered by about 3 to 1 , and the Russians in the laager continued to resist fiercely . To the south on the Russian left , General Adam Weide 's division had taken little part in the fighting . If Weide were to attack , along with the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two powerful forces . // Although he had thoroughly enjoyed his first taste of battle , Karl realized that some Russian pockets of resistance constituted a danger to his army , and that it was critical to convince them to surrender before nightfall . // Karl brought up artillery to pound the laager , but that proved unnecessary . The Swedes stormed the large central bastion without too much difficulty and , at about 8 a.m. , the Russian generals within sought to make terms . Karl was relieved , since his troops were beginning to fire on each other in the gloom . Having ordered a cease-fire , the Russians hoped to march out with full military honors , but after some haggling they agreed to surrender terms whereby the enlisted men kept their small arms but the officers , artillery and regimental colors were all left in Swedish hands . Since it was imperative to get rid of the prisoners as soon as possible , Karl set them to work repairing the Kamperholm bridge . Weide 's division remained to be dealt with , and one Swedish officer wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , he would certainly have beaten us , for we were extremely tired , having scarcely eaten or slept for several days , and besides this , all our men were drunk with brandy that they found in the Muscovite tents , so that it was impossible for the few officers that remained to keep them in order . " But that Swedish officer was unaware that Weide himself had been wounded and had learned that the northern wing had surrendered . In the morning , when he saw himself surrounded by Swedish cavalry , Weide sent a note stating that his men were prepared " to defend ourselves to the last drop of our blood ; but if we could come to a fair adjustment I will , if it be generous , accept it . " He duly capitulated , as did various small groups scattered across the field throughout the morning of November 21 . Karl stood by the Kamperholm bridge while the Russians laid their colors at his feet and trudged off toward the east . This astonishing victory had cost the Swedes 31 officers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian side will never be known but have been variously estimated at about 8,000 , plus 1,000 of Schermetyev 's cavalry drowned . Ten generals , including du Croy , 10 colonels and 33 other senior officers were taken-prisoner , along with the czar 's personal physician . They were sent first to Reval and then to Sweden , where most of them remained for many years . Du Croy suffered a curious fate . He was allowed to remain at Reval , whence he wrote the czar asking for money to help pay his expenses . Peter sent 6,000 rubles and later mourned the news of du Croy 's death in 1702 . " Had I entrusted him with the command fourteen days earlier , " he said , " I would not have suffered defeat at Narva . " Curiously , when the duke died he was once more insolvent , and his creditors invoked an ancient law that those in debt could not be buried . The body was placed in a church vault and mummified by the dry atmosphere . Eventually it was placed under glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wig for the next 200 years . Shortly before the Russian Revolution in 1917 , it was finally buried . The real booty for the victors was not the aging duke or his comrades but 145 guns , 32 mortars and four howitzers , with accompanying powder and shot . Peter 's army was effectively stripped of its main armament . Watching the Russians march away , Stenbock commented : " It is God 's work alone , but if there is anything human in it , it is the firm immovable resolution of His Majesty and the ripe dispositions of General Rehnskjold . " It has since been debated how much the victory was due to the " ripe dispositions " of the professional soldier or the " immovable resolution " of the 18-year-old Swedish king . What is unquestionable is from that point on , war became the principal object of the young man 's life . Thus he had taken the first step toward his doom . Had the victory come a little less easily , he might not have been so quick to accept the legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North , " who could , with only a handful of men , rout vast armies . Two days after the battle , Karl rode into Narva at the head of his Drabants and was mobbed by a cheering populace . He went straight to church to give thanks for his victory-a success that would cause him to dismiss the Russian army thereafter as worthless . It was a fatal dose of hubris for which he would pay dearly nine years later , at Poltava .
