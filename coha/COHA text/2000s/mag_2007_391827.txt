Headnote Local and organic wine and beer are delicious and eco-friendly options . Around the world , wine and beer are celebrated parts of many cultures , and these days , there 's more reason to celebrate than ever . Small breweries and wineries are thriving by crafting high quality , flavorful products . And with a growing number of breweries and wineries , it 's easier than ever before to find a wide variety of good wine and beer , including organic versions . As demand for organic products grows , more farmers are committing to producing grapes , barley and hops without chemical pesticides . It 's all part of a renewed interest in local flavor and natural ingredients-so cheers to local and organic ! A CRAFT BEER REVOLUTION To understand what these changes mean for flavor , let 's start by considering microbrewed beer . Until recently , variety has n't been a feature of the American beer market , which is dominated by one style of beer . Budweiser , Coors and Miller are all American-style lagers , and the " lite " versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are especially light as beer goes , without much texture or depth of flavor . In fact , as most beer lovers already know , there are dozens of official beer styles , all with distinctive colors , aromas , textures and flavors . And when brewing small batches of beer , brewers have the freedom to be creative . By contrast , many would say the mass-produced light lagers lack imagination . But there are a growing number of alternatives . " It 's a great time to be a beer drinker in this country , " says Paul Gatza , director of the national Brewers Association . " There are over 1,400 breweries making beer today-30 years ago there were 40 . We 're in an age of exploration for people who enjoy flavorful beers . " Gatza explains that this trend started in the 1980s when many states began to relax legal restrictions on brewing and brewpubs sprang up across the country . " They really laid the educational groundwork that there are these styles out there , that the beer world is bigger than domestic fight lager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by small breweries in a range of styles is " craft beer . " Gatza says that while all craft beer is growing fast , small regional microbreweries are growing even faster . He explains that flavor and variety are driving the industry , but people also choose local beer because it supports local businesses and addresses environmental concerns , such as the amount of energy consumed by transporting beer across the country . As craft beer grows in popularity , Gatza says it 's becoming more widely available . " Wholesalers and retailers are starting to take notice . " Another good sign : Some of the most specialized beer is the most popular . Gatza says seasonal releases are some of the breweries ' best sellers . " The future bodes very well for even more exploration for the flavorful beer drinker , " Gatza says . DIVERSE WINES , COMPLEX LAWS While the number of breweries has taken off , the number of wineries has grown rapidly , too . " In the 1960s there were about 300 wineries in the United States , and now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the wine-promoting organization Free the Grapes . He explains that most of these wineries are family owned and operated , with just four or five employees . These small wineries are n't producing the cheapest wines available on the market , but they 're making small batches with distinctive flavors , and increasingly they 've become popular stops for tourists . Though wine production in the United States is usually associated with California , wineries and vineyards are actually widespread ; there 's now at least one winery in each of the 50 states . Most states are using locally adapted grapes or other kinds of fruit entirely , such as cherries , plums or elderberries . The end product may be unfamiliar to those accustomed to cabernet , chardonnay and other grape varieties that grow well in warm , dry climates-such as those of France , Italy and California . But the wide diversity of wines available across the country is a wonderful opportunity for adventurous wine tasters and those seeking local flavor . But there 's a reason the organization Benson works for is called " Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are becoming popular , the laws about shipping wine are oddly complex . It 's easy if the great new winery you 've discovered is within your home state . But if you fall in love with a winery across one or more state lines , you may or may not be able to have it shipped to your home . The same thing is true if you want to buy organic wine and search for a source online . In 33 states-at last count-shipping wine directly to the customer is perfectly legal ; in the 17 others , it 's not . And the penalties for wineries that ship wine illegally are enough to put them out of business . It 's such a complex legal situation , it actually went to the Supreme Court in 2005 . The good news is that a favorable court decision has changed the laws in several states , and the majority of people in the United States can now freely order wine from out of state . Benson says the best way to find out whether wine can be shipped to your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can also find more information about state laws at www. freethegrapes.org . BEER GOES ORGANIC While the growth of small breweries and wineries is driven by people exploring new and better flavors , organic breweries and wineries are growing because of the desire for natural , sustainably grown ingredients , and their increasing availability . Abram Goldman-Armstrong is one of the founders of the Organic Brewers Organization , an association of brewpubs and microbreweries that produce organic beer . " I personally see organic as the next logical step in the craft brewing revolution , " Goldman-Armstrong says . He explains that until 100 years ago , all barley and hops were raised organically , because the chemical pesticides used today simply were n't available . For people who want to use traditional methods to make beer , it 's natural to want to use organic ingredients . But it 's not just about tradition , there are environmental factors , too . " You can feel better about what 's gone into an organic beer . You know there have n't been thousands of pounds of fertilizers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " When you 're drinking a non-organic beer , you 're still buying into that at some level . " Organic beer is getting easier to find . Major breweries are introducing their own brands , including Wild Hop Lager and Stone Mill Pale Ale from Anheuser Busch . Organic is also growing at the microbrewery level : New Belgium Brewing Co. has a new organic beer called Mothership Wit , and more brewpubs are offering organic beers , too . Goldman-Armstrong says many breweries started by making just one organic beer , rather than going completely organic . One brewpub that has wholeheartedly embraced organic beer is Ukiah Brewing Co. in Ukiah , Calif , the first certified organic brewpub in the United States . Not only do they make their own organic beer , they also serve organic wine . All their food is organic , as well . Brewmaster and owner Bret Cooperrider says that when his family decided to open the brewpub eight years ago , they were already dedicated environmentalists and committed to making the operation organic . " I feel that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooperrider says the biggest challenge of making organic beer is finding organic hops . " There are only about seven organic hops available right now , and that limits what you can do with beer . " The other main ingredient in beer is malted barley , and that is n't always easy to find either . " I 'd say that organic malt is more widely available , but it 's still pretty difficult to get , " he says . Ideally , he 'd like to buy not only organic , but local ingredients , too . For now , he 's able to get enough organic hops from a local farmer to brew one special seasonal beer every year , a fresh hop ale named Spyrock Special after the part of the county the hops come from . Goldman-Armstrong says that organic beer will become more available as brewers start working with local farmers to convince them that the demand for organic ingredients is there . In the same way , he says that more breweries will start producing organic beers when customers keep asking for them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pint glass , " Goldman-Armstrong says . " It does make a difference . " BEAUTIFUL ORGANIC VINEYARDS In the case of organic wine , many farmers and customers are already convinced . The organic wine business is growing rapidly , and you can find organic wine in more and more liquor stores across the country . LaRocca Vineyards is one of northern California 's many small organic wineries . Philip LaRocca 's family farms 200 acres , and produces 20,000 cases of wine annually . " When we started this business 20 years ago my wife and I were already into organic , " LaRocca says . " We thought it was simply a healthier lifestyle . " Unlike with beer , finding the organic ingredients is n't the biggest problem . Many organic wines are made with certified organic ingredients and are labeled " made with organic grapes . " However , going 100 percent organic is more of an issue , because that means making wine without sulfur dioxide , a common preservative . LaRocca wine is unusual in having a " 100 percent organic " label . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , but LaRocca was determined to do it . He 's against the use of chemical preservatives in general , but he 's also specifically concerned about sulfite sensitivities . He explains that non-organic winemakers can use about 100 different chemicals in their wine . " Sulfur dioxide is the only one the public has to be informed about , " he says . " There 's a reason for that . " A small percentage of people have sulfite sensitivies , and drinking nonorganic wine can cause them to break out in rashes or have other allergic reactions . This sensitivity is well documented and is most prevalent in people with asthma . Wine naturally contains some sulfites , but because it contains no added sulfur dioxide , most people with sulfite sensitivities can drink 100 percent organic wine without a problem . In most cases , there 's no obvious distinction in flavor between organic and conventional wine-although starting with , heal thy fruit and completely eliminating pesticide residues and preservatives ca n't hurt . But there 's a very noticeable difference in the style of farming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The concept behind organic agriculture is to build healthy soil , " LaRocca says . " We spent a lot of those early years just building the soil . " He explains that they still use about 300 tons of compost annually , and further improve the soil with covet crops . Nonorganic grapes are a heavily sprayed crop , and it 's reassuring to know that the soil , water and air of an organic vineyard are free of pesticides , not only for the health of the land , but also for the benefit of the people who work there and those who live nearby . And it 's good for the crop , too . Over the years , LaRocca says he 's seen all the effort pay off not only in the quality of the wine , but also in the health of the grapes . " Our fruit is just beautiful , " he says . Sidebar Well-crafted wine and beer are easy to get excited about .
