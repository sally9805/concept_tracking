At one point during my test in Washington 's San Juan Islands , the boat came to a gentle stop in an amphitheater of forest and rock , where it was surrounded by an anchored fleet . The crews looked up from their pulpit barbecues and their flag folding and fishing duties long enough to stare in silence as the San Juan 48 stopped and then quietly spun a 180-degree turn as if it were on a Lazy Susan , before heading back toward the harbor entrance . There was a similar reaction among boaters four years ago , when the San Juan 38 first arrived on the water with a Gatsby-like grace . The new 48 features the same curvaceous good looks , the brawn , the sex appeal and the classic lines that made its predecessor a benchmark model among gentlemen 's yachts . Built by Donald Campbell and Randy McCurdy of San Juan Composites Yachts in Anacortes , Wash. , and designed by Greg Marshall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of the Downeast lobsterboats that have long worked the coast of Maine , running in rough seas at the hands of old salts . The San Juan 48 is an evolutionary classic sportster , a luxury craft built artfully from stem to stern . It comes with a high price tag  --  $1.5 million  --  but it has the delicate moves that exude good breeding . " Both Randy and I stepped out of the megayacht industry , where we worked for years in production and management , to develop the same luxury standards and high-tech construction in a market for smaller boats , " said Campbell . " We recognized a niche for ultra-high-end , midsize boats that are built in the Northwest where there is so much talent . We wanted to produce a distinctive , fast cruising yacht that 's sporty and luxurious , and uncompromising on three points : performance styling and standard of finish . " San Juan Composites , formed in 1998 , is a small company ; it plans to build six of the 38 and six of the new 48 per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . The builder can work with each owner to satisfy his custom requests , but at the same time , every San Juan benefits from production construction methods that are truly state of the art . The 48 is built with composites . The hull , for instance , is formed using Kevlar/E-glass and Corecell foam core , materials that are vacuum-infused with epoxy vinylester resin to create a strong , void-free structure . There 's also a one-piece , vacuum-infused composite deck , which makes the 48 exceptionally rigid , but lighweight , too , and therefore swift at speed . During my sea trial , the 48 leaned hard into turns and lunged on demand  --  imagine Rolls Royce had its roots hauling pots in Bar Harbor . Powered by a pair of 825-hp turbocharged MTU diesel engines , the 48 is faster than most high-speed commuters , yielding 40 knots at wide-open throttle . When cruising at 30 knots ( 1800 rpm ) , the boat will yield a 437-mile range . And because this San Juan has a shallow 38-inch draft on a gull wing bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most boaters . The 48 quickly levels off onto plane and runs smoothly enough to keep the transom seat dry . To maximize tracking , the boat is built with a small keel . At the helm , a joystick control lets the skipper operate the throttle and thrusters ( bow and stern ) with one hand . The 48 has a slightly lower deck sheer than the 38 for increased visibility , and on this new model , there 's more wedge to the aft section of the running surface ; it 's designed to nudge the bow down at slower speeds . They say a small yard with a clear vision that 's driven by a passion for design is an incubator for great ideas . There are a number of notable features on the San Juan . The automatic , composite sunroof , for instance , will make the passengers in the pilothouse feel as if they are cruising in a convertible . That 's something you can enjoy beneath the glory of a starlit night or on a breezy , sunny day . The pilothouse offers 360 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topside cabin layout that includes a U-shaped dining settee for six people . The table to port sits high , so passengers can take in the view while dining or under way . To starboard is a full wet bar with plenty of counterspace for charts . The interior is radiant with satin-finished Burmese teak that 's handcrafted . There 's meticulous joinery , a teak-and-holly sole , raised-panel arched doorways , teak lathing and moldings , handsome hardware and soft , Italian-styled lighting . All in all , it 's an interior of megayacht elegance . Accommodations include a full master stateroom with head forward . A second head is amidships , aft of which is a second cabin . Here , berths for two passengers fold into a settee , so you can use this area as a lounge , too . The 48 also has an additional pipe berth for children . The aft cockpit is isolated from the pilothouse by a tempered glass door with removable port and starboard polycarbonate panels . This structure produces a quiet ride inside and offers a complete enclosure that will keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or warm when the night air becomes brisk in the off-season . The 48 has a large cockpit with ample room to lounge . A hatch that 's flush with the cockpit sole lifts hydraulically to provide access to the twin engines and generator protected by an automatic fire extinguishing system . The built-in aft seat tilts forward hydraulically to reveal a RIB that inflates in a few minutes with the flip of a switch . It comes with a 6-hp four-stroke outboard motor , and swivels to launch from the transom garage using a removable electric davit . The garage has room for extra gear . A hot/cold freshwater shower is located at the stern . The San Juan 48 was conceived and created by Campbell and McCurdy for boaters who can afford to buy anything but do n't want the burdens of a larger yacht . These two men are passionately detail-oriented , and they are committed to producing the finest boats they can imagine . They keep the business small and personable , and they keep their hands and heart in every stage of construction .
