When Nietzsche Wept A Novel of Obsession Chapter One The chimes of san salvatore broke into Josef Breuer 's reverie . He tugged his heavy gold watch from his waistcoat pocket . Nine o'clock . Once again , he read the small silver-bordered card he had received the day before . 21 October 1882 Doctor Breuer , I must see you on a matter of great urgency . The future of German philosophy hangs in the balance . Meet me at nine tomorrow morning at the Caf Sorrento . Lou Salom An impertinent note ! No one had addressed him so brashly in years . He knew of no Lou Salom . No address on the envelope . No way to tell this person that nine o'clock was not convenient , that Frau Breuer would not be pleased to breakfast alone , that Dr. Breuer was on vacation , and that " matters of urgency " had no interest for him  --  indeed , that Dr. Breuer had come to Venice precisely to get away from matters of urgency . Yet here he was , at the Caf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , wondering which one might be the impertinent Lou Salom . " More coffee , sir ? " Breuer nodded to the waiter , a lad of thirteen or fourteen with wet black hair brushed sleekly back . How long had he been daydreaming ? He looked again at his watch . Another ten minutes of life squandered . And squandered on what ? As usual he had been daydreaming about Bertha , beautiful Bertha , his patient for the past two years . He had been recalling her teasing voice : " Doctor Breuer , why are you so afraid of me ? " He had been remembering her words when he told her that he would no longer be her doctor : " I will wait . You will always be the only man in my life . " He berated himse1f . " For God 's sake , stop ! Stop thinking ! Open your eyes ! Look ! Let the world in ! " Breuer lifted his cup , inhaling the aroma of rich coffee along with deep breaths of cold Venetian October air . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Caf Sorrento were filled with breakfasting men and women  --  mostly tourists and mostly elderly . Several held newspapers in one hand and coffee cups in the other . Beyond the tables , steel-blue clouds of pigeons hovered and swooped . The still waters of the Grand Canal , shimmering with the reflections of the great palaces lining its banks , were disturbed only by the undulating wake of a coasting gondola . Other gondolas still slept , moored to twisted poles which lay askew in the canal , like spears flung down haphazardly by some giant hand . " Yes , that 's right  --  look about you , you fool ! " Breuer said to himself . " People come from all over the world to see Venice  --  people who refuse to die before they are blessed by this beauty . " How much of life have I missed , he wondered , simply by failing to look ? Or by looking and not seeing ? Yesterday he had taken a solitary walk around the island of Murano and , at an hour 's end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had transferred from his retina to his cortex . All his attention had been consumed with thoughts of Bertha : her beguiling smile , her adoring eyes , the feel of her warm , trusting body and her rapid breathing as he examined or massaged her . Such scenes had power  --  a life of their own ; whenever he was off guard , they invaded his mind and usurped his imagination . Is this to be my lot forever ? he wondered . Am I destined to be merely a stage on which memories of Bertha eternally play out their drama ? Someone rose at the adjoining table . The shrill scrape of the metal chair against the brick roused him , and once again he searched for Lou Salom . There she was ! The woman walking down the Riva del Carbon , entering the caf . Only she could have written that note  --  that handsome woman , tall and slim , wrapped in fur , striding imperiously toward him now through the maze of tight-packed tables . And as she neared , Breuer saw that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolgirl . But that commanding presence  --  extraordinary ! It would carry her far ! Lou Salom continued toward him with no trace of hesitation . How could she be so sure it was he ? His left hand quickly stroked the reddish bristles of his beard lest bits of breakfast roll still clung there . His right hand pulled down the side of his black jacket so that it did n't hunch up around his neck . When she was only a few feet away , she stopped for an instant and gazed boldly into his eyes . Suddenly Breuer 's mind ceased its chattering . Now looking required no concentration . Now retina and cortex cooperated perfectly , allowing the image of Lou Salom to pour freely into his mind . She was a woman of uncommon beauty : powerful forehead , strong , sculpted chin , bright blue eyes , full and sensuous lips , and carelessly brushed silver-blond hair gathered lackadaisically in a high bun , exposing her ears and her long , graceful neck . He noticed with particular pleasure the wisps of hair that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . In three more strides , she was at his table . " Doctor Breuer , I am Lou Salom . May I ? "  --  gesturing toward the chair . She sat down so quickly that Breuer had no time to offer her a proper greeting  --  to rise , to bow , to kiss her hand , to pull out her chair . " Waiter ! Waiter ! " Breuer snapped his fingers crisply . " A coffee for the lady . Caf latte ? " He glanced toward Frulein Salom . She nodded and , despite the morning chill , removed her fur wrap . " Yes , a Caf latte . " Breuer and his guest sat silent for a moment . Then Lou Salom looked directly into his eyes and began : " I have a friend in despair . I 'm afraid he 'll kill himself in the very near future . It would be a great loss for me , and a great personal tragedy because I would bear some responsibility ...
