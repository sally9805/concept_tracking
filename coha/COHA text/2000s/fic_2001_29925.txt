New York City June 15 Present Becca was watching an afternoon soap opera she 'd seen off and on since she was a kid . She found herself wondering if she would ever have a child who needed a heart transplant one month and a new kidney the next , or a husband who would n't be faithful to her for longer than it took a new woman to look in his direction . Then the phone rang . She jumped to her feet , then stopped dead still and stared over at the phone . She heard a guy on TV whining about how life was n't fair . He did n't know what fair was . She made no move to answer the phone . She just stood there and listened , watching it as it rang three more times . Then , finally , because her mother was lying in a coma in Lenox Hill Hospital , because she just plain could n't stand the ringing ringing ringing , she watched her hand reach out and pick up the receiver . She forced her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hi , Rebecca . It 's your boyfriend . I 've got you so scared you have to force yourself to pick up the phone . Is n't that right ? " She closed her eyes as that hated voice , low and deep , swept over her , into her , making her so afraid she was shaking . No hint of an Atlanta drawl , no sharp New York vowels , no dropped R 's from Boston . A voice that was well educated , with smooth , clear diction , perhaps even a touch of the Brit in it . Old ? Young ? She did n't know , could n't tell . She had to keep it together . She had to listen carefully , to remember how he spoke , what he said . You can do it . Keep it together . Make him talk , make him say something , you never know what will pop out . That was what the police psychologist in Albany had told her to do when the man had first started calling her . Listen carefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You guide him , not the other way around . Becca licked her lips , chapped from the hot , dry air in Manhattan that week , an anomaly , the weather forecaster had said . And so Becca repeated her litany of questions , trying to keep her voice calm , cool , in charge , yes , that was her . " Wo n't you tell me who you are ? I really want to know . Maybe we can talk about why you keep calling me . Can we do that ? " " Ca n't you come up with some new questions , Rebecca ? After all , I 've called you a good dozen times now . And you always say the same things . Ah , they 're from a shrink , are n't they ? They told you to ask those questions , to try to distract me , to get me to spill my guts to you . Sorry , it wo n't work . " She 'd never really thought it would work , that stratagem . No , this guy knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . She wanted to plead with him to leave her alone , but she did n't . Instead , she snapped . She simply lost it , the long-buried anger cutting through her bone-grinding fear . She gripped the phone , knuckles white , and yelled , " Listen to me , you little prick . Stop saying you 're my boyfriend . You 're nothing but a sick jerk . Now , how about this for a question ? Why do n't you go to hell where you belong ? Why do n't you go kill yourself , you 're sure not worth anything to the human race . Do n't call me anymore , you pathetic bastard . The cops are on to you . The phone is tapped , do you hear me ? They 're going to get you and fry you . " She 'd caught him off guard , she knew it , and an adrenaline rush sent her sky-high , but only for a moment . After a slight pause , he recovered . In a calm , reasonable voice , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as I do that the cops now do n't believe you 're being stalked , that some weird guy is calling you at all hours , trying to scare you . You had the phone tap put in yourself because you could n't get them to do it . And I 'll never talk long enough for that old , low-tech equipment of yours to get a trace . Oh yes , Rebecca , because you insulted me , you 'll have to pay for it , big-time . " She slammed down the receiver . She held it there , hard , as if trying to stanch the bleeding of a wound , as if holding it down would keep him from dialing her again , keep him away from her . Slowly , finally , she backed away from the phone . She heard a wife on the TV soap plead with her husband not to leave her for her younger sister . She walked out onto her small balcony and looked over Central Park , then turned a bit to the right to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of them tourists , sat on the steps , reading , laughing , talking , eating hot dogs from the vendor Teodolpho , some of them probably smoking dope , picking pockets , and there were two cops on horseback nearby , their horses ' heads pumping up and down , nervous for some reason . The sun blazed down . It was only mid-June , yet the unseasonable heat wave continued unabated . Inside the apartment it was twenty-five degrees cooler . Too cold , at least for her , but she could n't get the thermostat to move either up or down . The phone rang again . She heard it clearly through the half-closed glass door . She jerked around and nearly fell over the railing . Not that it was unexpected . No , never that , it was just so incongruous set against the normalcy of the scene outside . She forced herself to look back into her mother 's lovely pastel living room , to the glass table beside the sofa , at the white phone that sat atop that table , ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she knew she had to answer it . It might be about her mother , her very sick mother , who might be dying . But of course she knew it was him . It did n't matter . Did he know why she even had the phone turned on in the first place ? He seemed to know everything else , but he had n't said anything about her mother . She knew she had no choice at all . She picked it up on the tenth ring . " Rebecca , I want you to go out onto your balcony again . Look to where those cops are sitting on their horses . Do it now , Rebecca . " She laid down the receiver and walked back out onto the balcony , leaving the glass door open behind her . She looked down at the cops . She kept looking . She knew something horrible was going to happen , she just knew it , and there was nothing she could do about it but watch and wait . She waited for three minutes . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying new and different ways to terrorize her , there was a loud explosion . She watched both horses rear up wildly . One of the cops went flying . He landed in a bush as thick smoke billowed up , obscuring the scene . When the smoke cleared a bit , she saw an old bag lady lying on the sidewalk , her market cart in twisted pieces beside her , her few belongings strewn around her . Pieces of paper fluttered down to the sidewalk , now rutted with deep pockmarks . A large bottle of ginger ale was broken , liquid flowing over the old woman 's sneakers . Time seemed to have stopped , then suddenly there was chaos as everyone in view exploded into action . Some people who 'd been loitering on the steps of the museum ran toward the old lady . The cops got there first ; the one who 'd been thrown from his horse was limping as he ran . They were yelling , waving their arms-at the carnage or the onrushing people , Becca did n't know . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their eyes rolling at the smoke , the smell of the explosive . Becca stood there frozen , watching . The old woman did n't move . Becca knew she was dead . Her stalker had detonated a bomb and killed that poor old woman . Why ? Just to terrorize her more ? She was already so terrified she could hardly function . What did he want now ? She 'd left Albany , left the governor 's staff with no warning , had not even called to check in . She walked slowly back inside the living room , firmly closing the glass door behind her . She looked at the phone , heard him saying her name , over and over . Rebecca , Rebecca . Very slowly , she hung up . She fell to her knees and jerked the connector out of the wall jack . The phone in the bedroom rang , and kept ringing . She pressed herself close to the wall , her palms slammed against her ears . She had to do something . She had to talk to the cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would believe that some maniac was terrorizing her , stalking her , murdering someone to show her he meant business . This time they had to believe her . Six Days Later Riptide , Maine She pulled into the Texaco gas station , waved to the guy inside the small glass booth , then pumped some regular into her gas tank . She was on the outskirts of Riptide , a quaint town that sprawled north to south , hugging a small harbor filled with sailboats , motorboats , and many fishing boats . Lobster , she thought , and breathed in deeply , air redolent of brine , seaweed , and fish , plus a faint hint of wildflowers , their sweetness riding lightly on the breeze from the sea . Riptide , Maine . She was in the sticks , the boondocks , a place nobody knew about , except for a few tourists in the summer . She was sixty-four miles north of Christmas Cove , a beautiful small coastal town she 'd visited once as a child , with her mother . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt the salty air tingling on her skin , let the warm breeze flutter her hair against her cheek . She was in control of her life again . But what about Governor Bledsoe ? He would be all right , he had to be . He had cops everywhere , brushing his teeth for him , sleeping under his bed-no matter who he was sleeping with-hiding in his washroom off his big square office with its huge mahogany power desk . He would be all right . The crazy guy who had terrorized her until six days ago would n't be able to get near him . The main street in Riptide was West Hemlock . There was n't an East Hemlock unless someone wanted to drive into the ocean . She drove nearly to the end of the street to an old Victorian bed-and-breakfast called Errol Flynn 's Hammock . There was a widow 's walk on top , railed in black . She counted at least five colors on the exterior . It was perfect . " I like the name , " she said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yep , " he said , and pushed the guest book toward her . " I like it , too . Been Scottie all my life . Sign in and I 'll beam you right up . " She smiled and signed Becca Powell . She 'd always admired Colin Powell . Surely he would n't mind if she borrowed his name for a while . For a while , Becca Matlock would cease to exist . She was safe . But why , she wondered yet again , why had n't the police believed her ? Still they were providing the governor extra protection , so that was something . Why ?
