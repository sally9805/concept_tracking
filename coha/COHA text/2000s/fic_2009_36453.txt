Maybe I 'd have had a drink with the guy if I had known the next time I saw him he 'd be sprawled out in a Dumpster enclosure , with a greasy newspaper tented over his face . Then again , maybe not . <p> Nick Vigoriti had unsuccessfully hit on me as I sipped club soda at the bar . There were two or three likelier candidates in skimpier outfits who were n't working on a laptop , but he zeroed in on me . <p> I knew him , sort of . Earlier in the day , Vigoriti had been on line behind me checking into the Titans Hotel in Connecticut 's wine country . We 'd spent what seemed like twenty minutes listening to a statuesque redhead spitting out demands and fidgeting almost as much as the white Maltese she carried in her plastic designer bag . <p> " That is not friendly . " <p> The pimply kid behind the reception desk nodded furiously . <p> That , combined with the oversize jacket that hopefully fit his night-shift counterpart better , gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April does not need a sitter . I only came to this establishment because it 's supposed to be pet-friendly . I could have gotten comped at Hunting Ridge . " She towered over the poor kid , the pile of hair on her head giving her an extra four inches , as if she needed it . <p> Vigoriti and I exchanged brief " whaddya gon na do " glances , until the dog 's owner finished tormenting the desk clerk , then teetered off accompanied by a full luggage cart and the only bellman in sight . <p> When it was my turn , I set my backpack on the counter , leaned over , and told the clerk my name . <p> " I do n't see you , " he said , scrolling down the computer screen . <p> He forced himself to say the words , anticipating another pain-in-the-neck customer . Beads of sweat popped up on his forehead like condensation on a glass . I felt for the guy ; he was getting a crash course in Difficult Guests 101 on what I was guessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , " he said , his voice cracking . " Did you make the reservation online , by any chance ? " <p> Great . I 'd sat through rush-hour traffic on the highway and now there was no room at the inn . " It has to be there , " I said , trying not to betray my real feelings . " Will you please look again ? " <p> He continued to scan the screen ; then it occurred to me that my friend Lucy had made the reservation . Maybe it was under her name or her company 's . <p> " Can you check under KCPS-TV ? Or Cavanaugh . Check Cavanaugh , " I repeated , louder , in that stupid way people do when they 're talking to foreigners , as if saying something louder is going to make it easier to understand . <p> " Okay , okay , I got it . Here it is . ' Two adults , two doubles , no pets , ' " he read off the screen . Relief washed over the kid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This job was already an interruption of his real life  --  which was probably football , getting good grades , and procuring the perfect fake ID , not standing in a gold-braided uniform two sizes too big and catching verbal abuse . I did n't blame him ; I was in a service business myself and sometimes it wore thin . <p> I gave him my credit card for the " incidentals " and watched as he mindlessly swiped it and handed it back without even checking my name or the photo on the front . <p> " I 'll just need one key . My friend will be joining me later . " I plucked the paper folder from the counter and slid one plastic key back to him . <p> " Thank you , Ms. Cavanaugh . " <p> I started to correct him , then thought , What 's the point ? <p> " You 're welcome . " I snatched my bag from the counter and turned to leave . Asking him where the elevators were would only have extended the experience , so I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . I was hardly going to get lost in a suburban Connecticut hotel . <p> On the way , smack in the middle of the lobby , was an octagonal enclosure about twenty feet wide . Inside it , in a huge terracotta pot , was the reason I was there . Well , one of them anyway . Inside the glass enclosure was a corpse flower . I moved in for a closer look , setting my things down briefly on one of the laminated benches that circled the glass gazebo . <p> The pot itself was about four feet in diameter , and shooting straight up from the center was a light green veined shaft tinged with purplish pink . I had n't seen one in a few years and there was no getting around it  --  with that color and that shape . . . <p> " Pretty sexy if you ask me , " Vigoriti had said , over my shoulder . <p> " I did n't ask you , " I said , firmly enough to let him know I was n't about to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male anatomy . Not with a stranger anyway . <p> I picked up my bags , headed back toward the bank of elevators , around the corner from reception , and made a beeline for the first white triangle pointing up . Once inside , I pushed the button for my floor and crumpled , exhausted , against the side of the car . <p> Just as the doors were closing , a hand slapped them apart . <p> The hand was an unlikely combination of manicured and rough , as if a boxer had buffed his nails . A black leather strap was twisted around the thick wrist and the large tanned hand held , of all things , a man bag , almost lost in its owner 's large palm . The shirtsleeve was rolled up , thin gray stripes on black silk . Expensive , but not top of the line . And it half covered the muscular forearm of Nick Vigoriti . <p> " Hello , again . " He smiled , pushed the doors open , and settled politely into the opposite corner of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I pretended not to notice . <p> Vigoriti gave off the very appealing scent of whiskey , sweat , and , if I remembered correctly from two boyfriends ago , a dash of Armani  --  ordinarily a winning trifecta and one I 'd succumbed to in the past . But I was tired from the long drive and was n't feeling particularly friendly . Besides , this was an all-girls weekend . Lucy and I each had work to do , but it was really about two old friends catching up . I flashed him the fake one-second , toothless smile you use to acknowledge someone 's existence , then fixed my gaze straight ahead at the diamond pattern on the wall of the elevator until six pings told me I 'd reached my floor . Vigoriti got out , too . <p> For an instant , my antenna went up , but he turned left before I 'd committed to either direction . Happily , my room was on the right and I rushed down the hall , shifting my bags to one side and trying to remember which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fished the plastic card out of its sheath and slipped it into the lock . Nothing . I tried it stripe up , stripe down , toward me , and away from me . Five minutes later , after repeated wipes against my sweatshirt , the uncooperative sliver of plastic still refused to admit me to my room . I sank my forehead against the door and let out a low groan like a wounded animal . <p> " They 're a pain , are n't they ? " Vigoriti said , standing over my shoulder . <p> I had n't heard him approach , and was so startled I bumped my head looking up . Assessing the damage with one hand , I gave him the key with the other . " I 'm not proud . You try . " <p> He dipped the key once and the light flashed green . <p> " How did you do that ? " <p> " Magnetism . You have to have a magnetic personality . " <p> He had spared me a return match with the sweet but dopey desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lame come-on . <p> " I 'm kidding , " he said . " Sometimes technology just likes to . . . mess with you . " He held on to the key a few seconds longer than necessary , slapping it against his palm . Then he blew on it  --  as if to blow imaginary cooties away  --  and handed it back to me . <p> I picked up my bags , held the door open just a crack with my hip , and waited for him to leave . " Thanks , " I said , hoping he 'd take the hint . <p> He shrugged and strode down the hall to the elevators . Trailing him , in the air with his pheromones , was the word he almost said , but did n't . Fuggedaboudit . <p> I would n't have been at Titans at all if Lucy Cavanaugh had n't lured me there at the last minute with the offer of a free room , a spa weekend , and the promise of a corpse flower just about to bloom . Any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were irresistible . And I needed to believe I still did things spontaneously . <p> I 'd gotten freebies all the time in my old television job , but they were few and far between since I 'd started Dirty Business a couple of years back . Dirty Business was going through the terrible twos  --  sometimes wonderful and sometimes not . This was one of the not periods  --  before the season started , when I was planning my year but some of my clients still had holiday wreaths on their front doors . I had jumped at the chance for a few days of rest and relaxation on someone else 's dime . Once I knew we were going to Titans , I managed to squeeze a few bucks and a byline out of my local paper to let me write a piece on the rare corpse flower on display at the hotel . If nothing else it would get my name out in front of potential clients . <p> Lucy was venturing outside of New York City to chase down a story for Sin in Suburbia , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . The series had seemed like a good idea at the time and the network had ordered more episodes , but it had n't initially registered with Lucy that she 'd actually have to spend time in the suburbs , and that was tough duty for a woman who got vertigo anytime she went farther north . <p> If we had n't planned to meet at the bar I 'd have been in bed with room service and the remote , and I 'd have saved my picture taking until the morning . As it was , I swapped my sneakers for short cowboy boots and my T-shirt for a plain white shirt , which I tucked into my jeans . With a not-too-out-of-style dark blazer and a little bronzer I convinced myself I looked professional , French  --  simple and elegant . <p> Not that Titans had anything remotely like a dress code  --  the few people I had seen when I checked in could have been going to a kids ' soccer game . But I spent most of my days in gardening gear  --  pants tucked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratches , and when necessary a white mesh bug suit that covered me from head to toe and made me look like something out of a 1950s horror movie about the aftereffects of the hydrogen bomb . I welcomed any occasion to clean up my act . <p> An hour later , after taking more than two dozen pictures of the corpse flower , I was at the bar nursing my third club soda , feeling bloated and losing patience . There was a grand piano in the bar but judging by the amount of dust on it I did n't think I was in for any live music . I tried to ignore the third Muzak goround of that weepy song from Titanic and passed the time by filling in the details for the corpse flower story . I Googled the hotel 's history and checked out the clientele . No one was paying any attention to the plant . The seven-foot object in the glass box might have been a priceless sculpture or a giant turd for all anyone at Titans seemed to care . I scoured the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few Asian guys , a skinny blonde reading a romance novel , and a twitchy guy who looked like he desperately needed a drink . Then I saw him again . <p> Vigoriti entered the raised bar area and surveyed the place as if he owned it . He unwrapped a candy and popped it in his mouth , tossing the wrapper at a nearby ashtray and missing . I hoped he would n't notice me or would have the good sense to realize I was n't interested , but my limited experience with him already told me what to expect . Uninvited , he slid onto the bar stool right next to me . <p> " You going gambling ? If you 're calculating the odds on that computer I can tell you they always favor the house , " he said , his breath first-date minty . He must have been joking with that line . <p> This time I took a better look at him . He was handsome in a banged-up , been-around-the-block way . Built like a quarterback , or at least what they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips . And he had great hair . Long , but intellectual long , not **37;27;TOOLONG what are you thinking ? long . Then there was that intoxicating scent . There was no denying it , Nick Vigoriti smelled like trouble , or at the very least , an adventure . And I had n't had one lately . <p> " No kidding , " I said , snapping out of his thrall . " And is that your finding after years of careful research ? " I flipped the computer screen halfway down . <p> " I just got back from Vegas , " he said . " Thought I 'd save you some dough . " <p> " I 'm waiting for a friend , " I said , hoping to head him off before the pass . <p> " Could be I 'm that friend . " <p> He was losing points rapidly . Good looks got you so far with me , but a guy needed to have some gray matter . " Do you get many takers with these lines ? " I asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart they are , " he said , smiling and eyeing the other women at the bar . He turned back to me . " Now , those girls are girls . I 'm looking for a woman , about thirty to thirty-five , long dark hair , athletic build , " he said , giving a pretty good description of me . <p> I held up my hands to stop him . " I 'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt . This may not even be where you 're going , but I 'm not looking for a good time . Not that kind of good time . I 'm waiting for a friend . A real one , not one who 's in town for the widget convention . And she 's late . Other than her , the only reason I 'm here is the titan arum , " I said , attempting to scare him off with a little Latin . " The corpse flower . " I motioned in its direction . <p> " Corpse flower ? Is that what they call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to the plant we 'd been looking at earlier , the titan arum , the largest unbranched inflorescence in the world . In simple terms , the biggest flower that is n't on a tree . Spectacular and rare , but unsettling , since the corpse flower looks like a giant phallus , and smells , well , like rotting meat ; hence the name , and the need for an enclosure . I was guessing some dumb schmuck who did n't know any better thought the titan arum would be a clever promotion for Titans . I was also guessing same dumb schmuck was currently looking for another job . <p> " I heard the Mishkins had to fork over five grand for that box , " he said , " to keep the stench away from the paying customers . And they 're probably going to trash it once the damn thing blooms and it 's shipped back to the jungle . " <p> " I doubt they 'll do that . Smarter to donate it and get the tax deduction . The University of Wisconsin has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have it ; theirs bloomed a few years ago . " He eyed me as if I 'd just spoken in tongues or cracked the human genome . Okay , he was n't into plants . . . or big words . But the longer I looked at him , the less I cared . Brains were n't everything , and anyway , we were just talking . <p> If I stuck to club soda and we stayed in safe territory conversationwise , he could stay . Besides , I 'd enjoy the look on Lucy 's face when she rushed in breathlessly with stories and apologies and saw me sitting with a sexy beast like Nick Vigoriti . She and the rest of my friends had been after me to start dating again ever since I left New York City , and this little encounter might shut them up for a while . He might even contribute something interesting about the hotel that I could use for the article . Who knew ? <p> " Who are the Mishkins ? " I asked , surreptitiously keying that info into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , watching me use the computer . " Are you writing this down now ? " <p> " Yeah . Is that a problem ? " <p> Vigoriti shrugged . " Same difference . The Mishkins own the place , " he said , waving the sad-eyed bartender over . " They and their numerous partners . " <p> The bartender had a heart-shaped face and lank hair that hung in a skinny braid halfway down her back . <p> " What 're you having , Nicky ? " she asked , in an accent I could n't initially place , then decided was Russian . She wiped nonexistent spills from the bar and slipped a coaster in front of him , grazing his fingers . <p> " Dirty martini , " he said , pulling back his hand . " You ? " he asked me . <p> Every stupid thing I 'd done in my adult life had come after a few drinks , and I could imagine getting very stupid with Nick Vigoriti , so I stuck with club soda . <p> " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Mishkins ? " <p> " You think that 's a good idea ? " <p> " Why not ? " I said . " I may have a lucrative proposition for them . " <p> " They 're always interested in money . " He laughed . " I have n't talked to Bernie for a while , but that may change . His wife died a few months back . I have n't seen much of him since then . . . . I was really friendlier with her . " <p> Why was I not surprised ? What woman would n't want to be friends with a handsome stud who hung on your every word and made you feel as if you were the only woman in the room worth talking to ? <p> The bartender brought our drinks . Nick 's had six green olives on two plastic toothpicks . The bartender moved off to another customer but not before giving me a look that suggested she would n't mind seeing my head on a sharpened stick . <p> " What did I do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , swallowing hard and nodding in her direction . <p> " Adorable . " <p> " I used to work here , " Vigoriti continued . " Before Mishkin brought in the Malaysians , the Ukranians , let 's see . . . " He rattled off a laundry list of ethnic groups , then took a long pull on his drink . " Who is it now , Oksana ? " he called out to the bartender . <p> " Chinese , I think , " she said , over her shoulder , already fixing him a second drink . <p> " Their board meetings must look like a Benetton ad , " I muttered . <p> " Most of them cut bait . " <p> " It does n't look like business is too bad ; there are people here , " I said . <p> " We could go somewhere private to discuss this , " he said , signaling Oksana that he was ready for round two . He polished off his drink and slid all the olives into his mouth in a surprisingly suggestive move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You know , I was just trying to be polite . Always dangerous at a bar . I 'm sorry if I misled you , but I really am waiting for someone , and it is n't you . " As if on cue , my phone beeped with a text message . Lucy was running late . Typical . She 'd gotten a late start to begin with and one of the cheap Chinese New York-to-Boston shuttle buses had collided with a construction-materials truck . Gravel was spread all over I-95 . The result was the same as if a load of ball bearings had spilled out on the highway ; cars were drifting side to side as if they were in a Japanese video game . Lucy was stuck on the road , near Stamford , and wrote that she 'd call when she got closer . <p> Locals were trickling into the bar for after-dinner drinks , working guys with puffy baseball caps . And businessmen who might have heard about the mess on 95 and preferred to sit here instead of in traffic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar with Nick and possibly moving on to the harder stuff but decided against it . Life was complicated enough . <p> I chugged my drink and shut down the computer . " I 'm gon na cut bait , to use your expression . I have to go . I was serious about meeting the Mishkins , though . I may have a buyer . " I whipped out my business card and handed it to Nick as I got up to leave . <p> He looked puzzled and studied the card for longer than it took to read the six or eight words on it . Was it possible the guy could n't read ? " For the greenhouse , " I said , " the glass enclosure ? " <p> A smile crept over Nick 's handsome face . <p> " What 's so funny ? " <p> " My mistake , " he said , flicking the card with his index finger . " Not the kind of dirt I thought you dug up . " <p> That 's how my business card came to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the cops called on me hours later to identify his body . <p> I 'm a gardener . Paula Holliday , sole proprietor of Dirty Business , garden design , container maintenance , and the occasional exhumation . Not really , although that was the way my last major landscaping job turned out , in Springfield , Connecticut , where I live , about seventy miles south of the Titans Hotel . <p> Titans had been built in the twenties , a place where businessmen parked their families for the summer and raced up to on Friday afternoons . Third-tier comics and wedding and bar mitzvah bands played there on the weekends . The men would bake themselves with sun reflectors , drink heavily , and have their conjugal visits . Then they 'd wake up at the crack of dawn on Mondays , speeding back to Boston or New York and clocking themselves so they could compare travel times over drinks the following Friday . <p> By the sixties and seventies , kids did n't want to vacation with their parents anymore , Mom was just as likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titans fell to the wrecking ball . Somehow Titans had survived . That was as far as my online research had gotten me before Nick joined me at the bar . <p> I got to the elevator just as April , the white Maltese , and her redheaded owner were exiting , the larger of the two in a skintight tangerine outfit with hot-pink trim that accentuated her big frame . The woman looked away quickly , and I watched her make her way to the taxi line in front of the hotel , the scrawny dog hurrying to keep up . <p> Maybe some of Nick 's magnetism had rubbed off because , upstairs , this time my key card worked perfectly . The suite Lucy had reserved for us was large and benignly ugly . Nothing atrocious , just endless swathes of beige and dusty pink , from the synthetic bedspread and carpet , harboring god-knew-what kind of microorganisms , to the particleboard furniture . The only good news was that the furniture was from the sixties or seventies , so old there was an excellent chance that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hung the do not disturb sign on the doorknob and automatically turned on the television , something I always do in hotel rooms , but rarely do at home . A hotel channel reminiscent of the cheap ads at movie theaters showed slides of the lobby and a kidney-shaped pool that must have been another vestige from Titans 's good old days . The local news featured repeated helicopter shots of the collision on 95 from the same two angles . I kept the news on to get an update as to when Lucy might arrive and unpacked the rest of my things . <p> After years of traveling for work , I was an expert at packing light . Now that I rarely needed to look like a grown-up , I was even better at it . The white shirt went everywhere with me , and black jeans and a black jacket could pass for business attire if I needed to look reasonably professional . That was my uniform . I 'd thrown a pair of low-rise yoga pants and a thin hoodie into the bag and that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost as limited as my wardrobe and my viewing options , but I settled on a turkey club , hoping that the tryptophan would counteract the caffeine in the diet sodas I 'd guzzled on the drive to Titans . Then I curled up on the scratchy synthetic love seat and waited for food and Lucy . <p> I should have been at home fine-tuning this year 's plan for Caroline Sturgis 's garden . Dirty Business had a few customers in the high-rent district , and a handful of retailers whose seasonal planters I serviced , but Caroline was my biggest and favorite individual client . Four and a half rolling acres bordering the arboretum , money to burn , and always happy to see me . And she had so much lawn that her property was like a blank slate , like that chunky brick of loose-leaf paper the first week of school . Filled with possibilities . <p> No matter how hard I tried , I could n't entirely quash her enthusiasm for a green carpet and mass plantings of monochromatic annuals and bulbs . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had arranged to see her later that week . I wanted to be armed with sketches and some innovative ideas for her garden . That 's what I should have been doing , instead of sitting in a monastic room with mediocre food and no cable . <p> I must have dozed off on the love seat around nine p.m. and the knock came not long after . Still in my flip-flops , yoga pants , and hoodie , I opened my door and was then led downstairs and through the lobby by two uniformed cops and a hotel security guard who had introduced himself as Hector Ruiz . Hector was as short and wide as my first car , a vintage Volkswagen Rabbit . Remarkably , the shiny suit he wore was almost the same shade of Spanish olive green , not beautiful but very easy to spot in parking lots . <p> The cops marched , he waddled , and I followed , through a narrow service corridor , past a number of doors marked employees only , the laundry room , and the kitchen , until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading dock . <p> Off to one side was a tall , bearded guy in a stained down jacket . His Big Y shopping cart was crammed with bottles , bags , an American flag , and a padded moving blanket that , like him , had seen better days . Glassy eyes shone out of his dirty face and matted hair ; was it drugs , psychosis , or fright ? <p> On the ground , to the homeless guy 's right , surrounded by a knot of people , was a muscular body in black jeans and a gray-and-black-striped shirt , legs askew , face covered by an opened and now bloodied copy of yesterday 's Connecticut Post . <p> Not far from us two men donned paper jumpsuits and prepared to climb into a giant Dumpster . " Why do we always have to do the wet work ? " I heard the younger one mutter . " Because we 're the new guys , " the other one said . <p> I followed my escorts down the few sticky steps at the right of the dock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd someone barked , " She the one ? " The men stepped aside . Hidden behind a cluster of uniformed cops , plainclothesmen , and hotel security was a slight woman who appeared to be in charge . <p> " I 'm Detective Winters . This you ? " she asked , holding up my business card . Not too cute , not too boring , tasteful colors . I recognized it immediately , having agonized over it for weeks . I nodded yes . <p> " Dirty Business . You wan na explain that ? " <p> " It 's a gardening business . Dirt . It 's a joke , " I said lamely . " Get it ? " Obviously the woman had no sense of humor . <p> " You know this guy ? " <p> I 'd seen dead bodies before , and steeled myself for the shock . Winters used two gloved fingers to lift the tented newspaper . She kept her eyes glued to my face as she peeled back the paper and showed me Nick Vigoriti 's rugged face , which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fought the urge to puke . . . then quickly lost the fight , turning and narrowly missing my own bare toes and the dead guy 's Italian shoes . <p> " Whoa , that 's what we call contaminating the crime scene . " She snickered , stepping aside to avoid any backsplash . I swung around , unsteady on my feet , bumping into Hector and bouncing off his barrel chest . He grabbed me with both hands so I would n't fall back onto the body or slip on the remains of my club sandwich . <p> " What 's the problem ? " Winters said . " This should be right up your alley . You 're in a dirty business and he 's taking the big dirt nap . " <p> I was retching again , bent over , hands on knees , and could n't answer . <p> " It 's a joke , " she said . " Get it ?
