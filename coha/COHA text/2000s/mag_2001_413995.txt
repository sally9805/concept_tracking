What does it take to build a great collection ? A personal vision and plenty ofself-confidence. // As the daughter of one of the wealthiest businessmen in Victorian America , Electra Havemeyer Webb ( 1888-1960 ) could have followed convention and decorated her home with imported silks and intricately carved furniture . Instead , she chose to fill each room with copious collections of hooked rugs , weather vanes , and rustic furniture . " How can you , Electra , " her mother was provoked to exclaim , " you who have been brought up with Rembrandts and Manets , live with such American trash ? " Indeed , when Webb began to accumulate utilitarian artifacts in the early years of the 20th century , few scholars attributed any aesthetic or historical value to America 's native folk art and country furnishings . But something in the articulated lines of carousel horses , the bold colors of wallpaper-covered hatboxes , and the intricacies of patchwork quilts captivated Webb , and she gathered such humble objects with zeal , heeding the words of her father , H. O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a collector . " It is fortunate for us that Electra Havemeyer Webb did not let a little criticism deter her from her mission : Today more than 100,000 cultural artifacts-furniture , pottery , glassware , textiles , toys , tools-fill 37 historic buildings reconstructed on the grounds of the Shelburne Museum , a 45-acre site in Shelburne , Vt . If not for Webb and other collectors who shared her passion-Henry Francis du Pont , founder of the Winterthur Museum , in Winterthur , Del. , for example , or the namesake of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center , in Virginia 's Colonial Williamsburg-a priceless part of our national heritage would have been lost forever . The urge to collect is an intensely personal one . At the heart of any great collection-whether it fills a warehouse or a curio cabinet-is an attraction to an object , regardless of its appeal to others . Find additional objects that inspire that same appreciation , and a collection is begun . " We had no thoughts of building an important collection when we started out , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , who with her husband , Robert , amassed more than 1,000 quilts dating from the late 1700s through today . " We just bought what we loved . " Photograph Above : Eighteenth- and 19th-century trade signs populate the Stagecoach Inn Folk Art Gallery at the Shelburne Museum . Opposite page , top to bottom : Collections often begin with items that others consider too ordinary to save , like these early-20th-century sap buckets . This c. 1820 unsigned folk painting , Baby in Red Chair , is a centerpiece in the collection of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center , in Virginia 's Colonial Williamsburg . People living early in the 1900s would hardly believe that their everyday kitchenware would one day be collectible , but enamelware items like these are highly prized . // A personal collection often becomes one destined for a museum on the day when all reasonable storage options have been exhausted . Before founding the Shelburne Museum , for instance , Electra Webb lined the perimeter of an indoor tennis court with cigar-store Indians , ship figureheads , and carousel horses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripping over " spectators " during matches . Robert and Ardis James knew that their collection had outgrown their home when , Ardis recalls , " Bob could n't find a towel because all the linen cabinets were filled with quilts . " A storage unit built over the garage was a viable short-term solution , but in 1997 , the Jameses decided to donate 950 prize pieces to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln . The James Collection became the core of the university 's International Quilt Study Center . Lack of storage space also spurred collector Micky Wolfson to action . After years of storing furniture , paintings , books , and other items dating from 1885 to 1945 in his own home and the homes of " every friend and family member , " he founded the Wolfsonian , in Miami , Fla. , in 1986 . Today the seven-story , 56,000-square-foot structure harbors nearly 100,000 items chronicling postindustrial design in the United States and around the world . " I do n't want to let something that man created disappear without trying to make some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own everyday objects will fill the museums of tomorrow ? That is for a new generation of collectors to determine . They wo n't need a lot of money , for items not yet considered " collectible " are often available for a song . All they 'll need are a well-trained eye and a lot of storage space . WINTERTHUR TURNS 50 In addition to creating the Shelburne Museum , in Shelburne , Vt. , Electra Havemeyer Webb is credited with having sparked the interest of another great American collector , Henry Francis du Pont ( 1880-1969 ) , founder of the Winterthur Museum , Garden , &; Library , in Winterthur , Del . During a 1923 visit to Webb 's Vermont home , du Pont spied a large pine cupboard filled with pink Staffordshire plates that , he later recalled , " took my breath away . " The experience inspired du Pont to amass one of the world 's most important collections of American furniture and decorative arts , on view to the public since the museum opened in 1951 .
