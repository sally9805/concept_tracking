ME , I WAS NEVER AFRAID OF the dark . <p> It was Jeremy who bothered me - Jeremy with his black rubber spiders in my lunchbox , Jeremy with his guttural demon whisper ( I 'm coming to get you , Simon ) just as I was drifting off to sleep , Jeremy with his stupid Vincent Price laugh ( Mwha-ha-ha-ha-ha ) , like some cheesy mad scientist , when he figured the joke had gone far enough . By the time I was walking , I was already shell-shocked , flinching every time I came around a corner . <p> I remember this time , I was five years old and I had fallen asleep on the sofa . I woke up to see Jeremy looming over me in this crazy Halloween mask he 'd bought : horns and pebbled skin and a big leering grin , the works . Only I did n't realize it was Jeremy , not until he cut loose with that crazy laugh of his , and by then it was too late . <p> Things got worse when we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share a bedroom . That was fine with me . I was seven by then , and I had the kind of crazy love for my big brother that only little kids can feel . The thing was , when he was n't tormenting me , Jeremy was a great brother-like this one time he got a Chuck Foreman card in a package of Topps and he just handed it over to me because he knew the Vikings were my favorite team that year . <p> The room thing was hard on Jeremy , though . He 'd reached that stage of adolescence when your voice has these alarming cracks and you spend a lot of time locked in the bathroom tracking hair growth and ... well , you know , you were a kid once , right ? So the nights got worse . I could n't even turn to Mom for help . She was sick at that time , and she had this frayed , wounded look . Plus , she and Dad were always talking in these strained whispers . You did n't want to bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Which left me and Jeremy alone in our bedroom . It was n't much to look at , just this high narrow room with twin beds and an old milk crate with a lamp on it . Out the window you could see one half-dead crab-apple tree - a crap-apple , Jeremy called it - and a hundred feet of crumbling pavement and a rusting 1974 El Camino which our neighbor had up on blocks back where the woods began . There were n't any street lights that close to the edge of town , so it was always dark in there at night . <p> That 's when Jeremy would start up with some crap he 'd seen in a movie or something . " I heard they found a whole shitload of bones when they dug the foundation of this house , " he 'd say , and he 'd launch into some nutty tale about how it turned out to be an Indian burial ground , just crazy stuff like that . After a while , it would get so I could hardly breathe . Then Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Si , " he 'd say , " you know I 'm only kidding . " <p> He was always sorry - genuinely sorry , you could tell by the look on his face - but it never made any difference the next night . It was like he forgot all about it . Besides , he always drifted off to sleep , leaving me alone in the dark to ponder open portals to Hell or parallel worlds or whatever crazy stuff he 'd dreamed up that night . <p> The days were n't much better . The house was on this old winding road with woods on one side and there were n't but a few neighbors , and none of them had any kids . It was like somebody had set off a bomb that just flattened everybody under twenty-like one of those neutron bombs , only age-specific . <p> So that was my life - interminable days of boredom , torturous insomniac nights . It was the worst summer of my life , with nothing to look forward to but a brand-new school come the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement about a week after we moved in . Nobody had bothered to unpack - nobody had bothered to do much of anything all summer - and I was hoping to find my old teddy bear in one of the boxes . <p> Mr. Fuzzy had seen better days - after six years of hard use , he literally had no hair , not a single solitary tuft - and I 'd only recently broken the habit of dragging him around with me everywhere I went . I knew there 'd be a price to pay for backsliding - Jeremy had been riding me about Mr. Fuzzy for a year - but desperate times call for desperate measures . <p> I 'd just finished rescuing him from a box of loose Legos and Jeremy 's old Star Wars action figures when I noticed a bundle of rags stuffed under the furnace . I was n't inclined to spend any more time than necessary in the basement - it smelled funny and the light slanting through the high dirty windows had a hazy greenish quality , like a pond you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging Mr. Fuzzy over toward the furnace all the same . <p> Somebody had jammed the bundle in there good , and when it came loose , clicking metallically , it toppled me back on my butt . I stood , brushing my seat off with one hand , Mr. Fuzzy momentarily forgotten . I squatted to examine the bundle , a mass of grease-stained rags tied off with brown twine . The whole thing was only a couple feet long . <p> I loosened the knot and pulled one end of the twine . The bundle unwrapped itself , spilling a handful of rusty foot-long skewers across the floor . There were half a dozen of them , all of them with these big metal caps . I shook the rag . A scalpel tumbled out , and then a bunch of other crap , every bit of it as rusty as the skewers . A big old hammer with a wooden head and a wicked-looking carving knife and one of those tapered metal rods butchers use to sharpen knives . Last of all a set of ivory-handled flatware . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's when I heard the stairs creak behind me . <p> " Mom 's gon na kill you , " Jeremy said . <p> I jumped a little and stole a glance over my shoulder . He was standing at the foot of the stairs , a rickety tier of backless risers . That 's when I remembered Mom 's warning that I was n't to fool around down here . The floor was just dirt , packed hard as concrete , and Mom always worried about getting our clothes dirty . <p> " Not if you do n't tell her , " I said . <p> " Besides , you 're messing around with the furnace , " Jeremy said . <p> " No , I 'm not . " <p> " Sure you are . " He crossed the room and hunkered down at my side . I glanced over at him . Let me be honest here : I was nobody 's ideal boy next door . I was a scrawny , unlovely kid , forever peering out at the world through a pair of lenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to ignite ants with them . The changeling , my mother sometimes called me , since I seemed to have surfaced out of somebody else 's gene pool . <p> Jeremy , though , was blond and handsome and already broad-shouldered . He was the kind of kid everybody wants to sit with in the lunchroom , quick and friendly and capable of glamorous strokes of kindness . He made such a gesture now , clapping me on the shoulder . " Jeez , Si , that 's some weird-looking shit . Wonder how long it 's been here ? " <p> " I du n no , " I said , but I remembered the landlord telling Dad the house was nearly a hundred and fifty years old . And has n't had a lick of work since , I 'd heard Dad mutter under his breath . <p> Jeremy reached for one of the skewers and I felt a little bubble of emotion press against the bottom of my throat . He turned the thing over in his hands and let it drop to the floor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You 're not gon na tell Mom , are you ? " <p> " Nah . " He seemed to think a moment . " Course I might use that scalpel to dissect Mr. Fuzzy . " He gazed at me balefully , and then he slapped my shoulder again . " Better treat me right , kid . " <p> A moment later I heard the basement door slam behind me . <p> I 'd been clutching the fork so tightly that it had turned hot in my hand . My knuckles grinned up at me , four bloodless white crescents . I felt so strange that I just let it tumble to the floor . Then I re-wrapped the bundle , and shoved it back under the furnace . <p> By the time I 'd gotten upstairs , I 'd put the whole thing out of my mind . Except I had n't , not really . I was n't thinking about it , not consciously , but it was there all the same , the way all the furniture in a room is still there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense it there in the dark . Or the way pain is always there . Even when they give you something to smooth it out a little , it 's always there , a deep-down ache like jagged rocks under a swift-moving current . It never goes away , pain . It 's like a stone in your pocket . <p> The bundle weighed on me in the same way , through the long night after Jeremy finally fell asleep , and the next day , and the night after that as well . So I guess I was n't surprised , not really , when I found myself creeping down the basement stairs the next afternoon . Nobody saw me steal up to my room with the bundle . Nobody saw me tuck it under my bed . Mom had cried herself to sleep in front of the TV ( she pretended she was n't crying , but I knew better ) and Dad was already at work . Who knew where Jeremy was ? <p> Then school started and Mom did n't cry as often , or she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them talked very much , except at dinner Dad always asked Jeremy how freshman football was going . And most nights , just as a joke , Jeremy would start up with one of those crazy stories of his , the minute we turned out the light . He 'd pretend there was a vampire in the room or something and he 'd thrash around so that I could hear him over the narrow space between our beds . " Ahhh , " he 'd say , " Arrggh , " and , in a strangled gasp , " When it finishes with me , Si , it 's coming for you . " I 'd hug Mr. Fuzzy tight and tell him not to be afraid , and then Jeremy would unleash that nutty mad scientist laugh . <p> " C'm on , Si , you know I 'm only kidding . " <p> One night , he said , " Do you believe in ghosts , Si ? Because as old as this house is , I bet a whole shitload of people have died in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it a lot over the next few days . We 'd been in school a couple of weeks at this point . Jeremy had already made a lot of friends . He talked to them on the phone at night . I had a lot of time to think . <p> I even asked Dad about it . " Try not to be dense , Si , " he told me . " There 's no such thing as ghosts , everybody knows that . Now chill out , will you , I 'm trying to explain something to your brother . " <p> So the answer was , no , I did n't believe in ghosts . But I also thought itmight be more complicated than that , that maybe they were like characters in a good book . You are n't going to run into them at the Wal-Mart , but they seem real all the same . I figured ghosts might be something like that . The way I figured it , they had to be really desperate for something they had n't gotten enough of while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something . Otherwise why would they stick around some crummy old cemetery when they could go on to Heaven or whatever ? So that 's what I ended up telling Jeremy a few nights later , after I 'd finished sorting it all out inside my head . <p> " Hungry ! " he said . " Christ , Si , that 's the stupidest thing I 've ever heard . " He started thrashing around in his bed and making these dumb-ghost noises . " Oooooooh , " he said , and , " Ooooooooh , I 'm a ghost , give me a steak . Ooooooooh , I want a bowl of Cheerios . " <p> I tried to explain that that was n't what I meant , but I could n't find the words . I was just a kid , after all . <p> " Christ , Si , " Jeremy said , " do n't tell anybody anything that stupid . It 's like that stupid bear you drag around everywhere , it makes me ashamed to be your brother . " <p> I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always joking around - but it hurt Mr. Fuzzy 's feelings all the same . " Do n't cry , Mr. Fuzzy , " I whispered . " He did n't mean anything by it . " <p> A few days later , Jeremy came home looking troubled . I did n't think anything about it at first because it had n't been a very good day from the start . When Jeremy and I went down to breakfast , we overheard Dad saying he was taking Mom 's car in that afternoon , the way they had planned . Mom said something so low that neither one of us could make it out , and then Dad said , " For Christ 's sake , Mariam , there 's plenty of one-car families in the world . " He slammed his way out of the house , and a few seconds later we heard Mom shut the bedroom door with a click . Neither one of us said anything after that except when Jeremy snapped at me because I was so slow getting my lunch . So I knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home from football practice that day looking a bit down in the mouth . <p> It turned out to be something totally different , though , because as soon as we turned out the light that night , and he knew we were really alone , Jeremy said , " What happened to that bundle of tools , Si ? " <p> " What bundle of tools ? " I asked . <p> " That weird-looking shit you found in the basement last summer , " he said . <p> That 's when I remembered that I 'd put the bundle under my bed . What a crazy thing to do , I thought , and I was about to say I 'd taken them - but Mr. Fuzzy kind of punched me . He was so sensitive , I do n't think he 'd really forgiven Jeremy yet . <p> I thought it over , and then I said , " Beats me . " <p> " Well , I went down the basement this afternoon , " Jeremy said , " and they were gone . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . " <p> " Why ? " <p> Jeremy did n't say anything for a long time . A car went by outside , and the headlights lit everything up for a minute . The shadow of the crap-apple danced on the ceiling like a man made out of bones , and then the night swallowed him up . That one little moment of light made it seem darker than ever . <p> " I met this kid at school today , " Jeremy said , " and when I told him where I lived he said , ' No way , Mad Dog Mueller 's house ? ' ' Mad Dog who ? ' I said . ' Mueller , ' he said . ' Everyone knows who Mad Dog Mueller is . ' " <p> " I do n't , " I said . <p> " Well , neither did I , " Jeremy said , " but this kid , he told me the whole story . ' You ever notice there are n't any kids that live out that end of town ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Si , the more right he seemed . There are n't any kids . " <p> The thing was , he was right . That 's when I figured it out , the thing about the kids . It was like one of those puzzles with a picture hidden inside all these little blots of color and you stare at it and you stare at it and you do n't see a thing , and then you happen to catch it from just the right angle and - Bang ! - there the hidden picture is . And once you 've seen it , you can never unsee it . I thought about the neighbors , this scrawny guy who was always tinkering with the dead El Camino and his fat wife - neither one of them really old , but neither one of them a day under thirty , either . I remembered how they stood out front watching us move in , and Mom asking them if they had any kids , her voice kind of hopeful . But they 'd just laughed , like who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't offered to pitch in , either - and people always offer to lend a hand when you 're moving stuff inside . I know , because we 've moved lots of times . I could see Dad getting hotter and hotter with every trip , until finally he turned and said in a voice just dripping with sarcasm , " See anything that strikes your fancy , folks ? " You could tell by the look on Mom 's face that she did n't like that one bit . When we got inside she hissed at him like some kind of animal she was so mad . " Why ca n't you ever keep your mouth shut , Frank ? " she said . " If you kept your mouth shut we would n't be in this situation . " <p> All of which was beside the point , of course . The point was , Jeremy was right . There was n't a single kid in any of the nearby houses . <p> " See , " Jeremy said , " I told you . And the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it was some old lady that used to live here , " I said . " We saw her the first day . They were moving her to a nursing home . " <p> " I 'm not talking about her , stupid . I 'm talking like a hundred years ago , when this was all farm land , and the nearest neighbors were half a mile away . " <p> " Oh . " <p> I did n't like the direction this was going , I have to say . Plus , it seemed even darker . Most places , you turn out the light and your eyes adjust and everything turns this smoky blue color , so it hardly seems dark at all . But here the night seemed denser somehow , weightier . Your eyes just never got used to it , not unless there was a moon , which this particular night there was n't . <p> " Anyway , " Jeremy said , " I guess he lived here with his mother for a while and then she died and he lived here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess , like forty . He was a blacksmith . " <p> " What 's a blacksmith ? " <p> " God , you can be dense , Si . Blacksmiths make horseshoes and shit . " <p> " Then why do they call them blacksmiths ? " <p> " I do n't know . I guess they were black or something , like back in slavery days . " <p> " Was this guy black ? " <p> " No ! The point is , he makes things out of metal . That 's the point , okay ? And so I told this kid about those tools I found . " <p> " I 'm the one who found them , " I said . <p> " Whatever , Si . The point is , when I mentioned the tools , the kid who was telling me this stuff , his eyes bugged out . ' No way , ' he says to me , and I 'm like , ' No , really , cross my heart . What gives ? ' " <p> Jeremy paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard a faint click , like two pieces of metal rubbing up against each other . That 's when I understood what Jeremy was doing . He was " acting out , " which is a term I learned when I forgot Mr. Fuzzy at Dr. Bainbridge 's one day , back at the clinic in Starkville , after I got suspended from school . When I slipped inside to get him , Dr. Bainbridge was saying , " You have to understand , Mariam , with all these pressures at home , it 's only natural that he 's acting out . " <p> I asked Dr. Bainbridge about it the next week , and he told me that sometimes people say and do things they do n't mean just because they 're upset about something else . And now I figured Jeremy was doing it because he was so upset about Mom and stuff . He was trying to scare me , that 's all . He 'd even found the little bundle of tools under my bed and he was over there clicking them together . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I had n't understood , I might have even been afraid - Mr. Fuzzy was . I could feel him shivering against my chest . <p> " Did you hear that ? " Jeremy said . <p> " I did n't hear anything , " I said , because I was n't going to play along with his game . <p> Jeremy did n't answer right away . So we lay there , both of us listening , and this time I really did n't hear anything . But it seemed even darker somehow , darker than I 'd ever seen our little bedroom . I wiggled my fingers in front of my face and I could n't see a thing . <p> " I thought I heard something . " This time you could hear the faintest tremor in his voice . It was a really fine job he was doing . I could n't help admiring it . " And that would be bad , " Jeremy added , " because this Mueller , he was crazy as a shithouse rat . " <p> I hugged Mr. Fuzzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Crazy , " Jeremy said solemnly . " This kid , he told me that all the farms around there , the farmers had about a zillion kids . Everybody had a ton of kids in those days . And one of them turned up missing . No one thought anything about it at first - kids were always running off - but about a week later another kid disappears . This time everybody got worried . It was this little girl and nobody could figure out why she would run off . She was only like seven years old . " <p> " She was my age ? " <p> " That 's right , Si . She was just your age . " <p> Then I heard it again : this odd little clicking like Grandma 's knitting needles used to make . Jeremy must have really given that bundle a shake . <p> " Shit , " Jeremy said , and now he sounded really scared . Somebody ought to have given him an Oscar or something . <p> He switched on the light . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , Hey , I 'm not doing anything ! , which of course meant he was . I stared , but the bundle was nowhere in sight . I figured he must have tucked it under the covers , but it was hard to tell without my glasses on . Everything looked all blurry , even Jeremy 's face , blinking at me over the gap between the beds . I scooched down under the covers , holding Mr. Fuzzy tight . <p> " It was coming from over there , " he said . " Over there by your bed . " <p> " I did n't hear anything , " I said . <p> " No , I 'm serious , Si . I heard it , did n't you ? " <p> " You better turn out the light , " I said , just to prove I was n't afraid . " Mom 'll be mad . " <p> " Right , " Jeremy said , and the way he said it , you could tell he knew it was an empty threat . Mom had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bedroom door after school . I opened the door , but it was dark inside and she told me to go away . The room smelled funny , too , like the stinging stuff she put on my knee the time Jeremy accidentally knocked me down in the driveway . I just need to sleep , she said . I 've taken some medicine to help me sleep . <p> And then Jeremy came home and made us some TV dinners . " She must have passed out in there , " he said , and that scared me . But when I said maybe we should call the doctor , he just laughed . " Try not to be so dense all the time , okay , Si ? " <p> We just waited around for Dad after that . But Jeremy said he wouldn'tbe surprised if Dad never came home again , the way Mom had been so bitchy lately . Maybe he was right , too , because by the time we went up to bed , Dad still had n't shown up . <p> So Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We both had a look around . The room looked pretty much the way it always did . Jeremy 's trophies gleamed on the little shelf Dad had built for them . A bug smacked the window screen a few times , like it really wanted to get inside . <p> " You sure you did n't hear anything ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> Jeremy looked at me for a minute . " All right , then , " he said , and turned out the light . Another car passed and the crap-apple man did his little jig on the ceiling . The house was so quiet I could hear Jeremy breathing these long even breaths . I sang a song to Mr. Fuzzy while I waited for him to start up again . It was this song Mom used to sing when I was a baby , the one about all the pretty little horses . <p> And then Jeremy started talking again . <p> " Nobody got suspicious , " he said , " until the third kid disappeared - a little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then someone happened to remember that all these kids had to walk by this Mueller guy 's house on their way to school . So a few of the parents got together that night and went down there to see if he had seen anything . " <p> It had gotten colder . I wished Jeremy would shut the window and I was going to say something , but he just plowed on with his stupid story . " Soon as he answered the door , " Jeremy said , " they could tell something was wrong . It was all dark inside - there was n't a fire or anything - and it smelled bad , like pigs or something . They could hardly see him , too , just his eyes , all hollow and shiny in the shadows . They asked if he 'd seen the kids and that 's when things got really weird . He said he had n't seen anything , but he was acting all nervous , and he tried to close the door . One of the men held up his lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't shaved and he looked real thin and there was this stuff smeared over his face . It looked black in the light , like paint , only it was n't paint . You know what it was , Si ? " <p> I 'd heard enough of Jeremy 's stories to be able to make a pretty good guess , but I could n't seem to make my mouth say the word . Mr. Fuzzy was shaking he was so scared . He was shaking real hard , and he was mad , too . He was mad at Jeremy for trying to scare me like that . <p> " It was blood , Si , " Jeremy said . <p> That 's when I heard it again , a whisper of metal against metal like the sound the butcher makes at the grocery store when he 's putting the edge on a knife . <p> Jeremy gasped . " Did you hear that ? " <p> And just like that the sound died away . <p> " No , " I said . <p> We were silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I wanted him to finish it . If he finished he could do his dumb little mad scientist laugh and admit he made it all up . <p> " He ran , " Jeremy said . " He ran through the house and it was all dark and he went down the basement , down where you found those rusty old tools . Only it was n't rust , Si . It was blood . Because you know what else they found down there ? " <p> I heard the whisper of metal again - shir shir shir , that sound the butcher makes when he 's putting the edge on a knife and his hands are moving so fast the blade is just a blur of light . But Jeremy had already started talking again . <p> " They found the missing kids , " he said , but it sounded so far away . All I could hear was that sound in my head , shir shir shir . " They were dead , " Jeremy was saying , " and pretty soon he was dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't even get a trial . They put him down the same way he 'd killed those kids . " <p> I swallowed . " How was that ? " <p> " He used those long nails on them , those skewer things . He knocked them on the head or something and then , while they were out , he just hammered those things right through them - wham wham wham - so they were pinned to the floor , they could n't get up . And then you know what he did ? " <p> Only he did n't wait for me to answer , he could n't wait , he just rolled on . He said , " Mueller used the scalpel on them , then . He just ripped them open and then - " Jeremy 's voice broke . It was a masterful touch . " And then he started eating , Si . He started eating before they were even dead - " <p> Jeremy broke off suddenly , and now the sound was so loud it seemed to shake the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold I could see my breath fogging up the dark . <p> " Christ , what 's that sound ? " Jeremy whimpered , and then he started making moaning sounds way down in his throat , the way he always did , like he wanted to scream but he was too afraid . <p> Mr. Fuzzy was shaking , just shaking so hard , and I have to admit it , right then I hated Jeremy with a hatred so pure I could taste it , like an old penny under my tongue . The darkness seemed heavy suddenly , an iron weight pinning me to my bed . It was cold , too . It was so cold . I 've never been so cold in my life . <p> " Christ , Si , " Jeremy shrieked . " Stop it ! Stop it ! STOP IT ! " <p> Mr. Fuzzy was still shaking in my arms , and I hated Jeremy for that , I could n't help it , but I tried to make myself get up anyway , I really tried . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow over me , like concrete that had n't quite formed up , binding me to my mattress with Mr. Fuzzy cowering in my arms . <p> Jeremy 's whole bed was shaking now . He was grunting and wrestling around . I heard a pop , like a piece of taut rubber giving way , and a wooden wham wham wham . There was this liquidy gurgle and Jeremy actually screamed , this long desperate scream from the bottom of his lungs . I really had to admire the job he was doing , as much as I could n't help being mad . He 'd never taken it this far . It was like watching a master at the very peak of his form . There was another one of those liquidy thumps and then the sound of the hammer and then the whole thing happened again and again . It happened so many times I lost track . All I knew was that Jeremy had stopped screaming , but I could n't remember when . The only sound in the room was this muffled thrashing sound , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stopped , too . Everything just stopped . <p> It was so still . There was n't any sound at all . <p> The dark lay heavy on my skin , pinning me down . It was all I could do to open my mouth , to force the word out - <p> " Jeremy ? " <p> I waited then . I waited for the longest time to hear that stupid Vincent Price laugh of his , to hear Jeremy telling me he 'd gotten me this time , he was only joking , Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha . <p> But the laugh never came . <p> What came instead was the sound of someone chewing , the sound of someone who had n't had a meal in ages just tucking right in and having at it , smacking his lips and slurping and everything , and it went on and on and on . The whole time I just lay there . I could n't move at all . <p> It must have gone on for hours . I do n't know how long it went on . All I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hear a thing . <p> I waited some more for Jeremy to make that stupid laugh of his . And then a funny thing happened . I was n't lying in my bed after all . I was standing up between the beds , by the milk crate we used for a night stand , and I was tired . I was so tired . My legs ached like I 'd been standing there for hours . My arms ached , too . Every part of me ached . I ached all over . <p> I kept having these crazy thoughts , too . About ghosts and hunger and how hungry Mad Dog Mueller must have been , after all those years down in the basement . About how maybe he 'd spent all that time waiting down there , waiting for the right person to come along , someone who was just as hungry as he was . <p> They were the craziest thoughts , but I could n't seem to stop thinking them . I just stood there between the beds . My face was wet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must have been crying . <p> I just stood there waiting for Jeremy to laugh that stupid mad scientist laugh of his and tell me it was all a game . And I have to admit something : I was scared , too . I was so scared . <p> But it was n't the dark I was scared of . <p> God help me , I did n't want to turn on the light . <p> Author Affiliation
