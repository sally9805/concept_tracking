Chapter One The Fleabag 500 Otto was behind the wheel , in starting position for the Fleabag 500 . The race was named after the stadium owner 's dog , who was in the book of Guinness World Records for continually scratching himself every second for the last 14 years . Otto 's lucky guitar was on the seat next to him . The despicable Wilson Carlson Fullsom was in position right beside Otto , in car 56 . " Hey Pullup , swell banjo , " he said . " Let me get a look at it . " " Sure , " said Otto . That was the nicest thing Fullsom had ever said to him , even if he did get a few facts wrong , like his name , but at least he had used a palindrome . Otto held up the guitar . " It 's a guitar , " said Otto . Fullsom had a raw egg . He threw it . Luckily , Otto had enclosed the guitar in a superhard clear , elastic case .

" Catch you next time , Foulsome , " said Otto . " Car trouble . " He pulled a lever , and smoke poured out from a smoke machine under Racecar 's hood . Otto disqualified himself and left the track . Wilson Carlson Fullsom could n't believe his luck . Without Racecar in the race , he had a pretty good chance of winning . He got out of his car and started yelling at Otto , " Look at that broken-down hunk of tin . What a loser . Where 're ya goin ' , loser ? Afraid of A Clifford ? Look at the chicken . " Fullsom was still flapping his arms and making idiotic chicken noises when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whizzed by , leaving him in the dust . Continues ...
