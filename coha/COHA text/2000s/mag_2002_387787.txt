TRAVELER 'S NOTEBOOK Headnote The Flitner homestead , in Wyoming 's Bighorn Mountains , has been in the same family for five generations . Now you can join them for a stay on a real working ranch . // The first thing you find out about the Flitner Ranch is that it 's big . Unlike most guest ranches , where you use a main lodge as your base , then take morning rides , afternoon rides or both , the 250,000-acre Flitner , set at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains in northern Wyoming , is so immense that , if you wish , you can start riding in the morning , stop for lunch at a smaller lodge by noon and keep right on going ' til dusk . I know this because my husband and I , along with a half  --  dozen fellow guests , opted to ride one day from the Hideout ( Flitner 's guest resort ) to the Upper Hideout ( one of its two compounds perched in the Bighorns ) . This ride was not for the faint of heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy with the first snow , rode up farther onto expansive alpine meadows gleaming with fall sunlight and sage , and from there , up and up , through bright snowdrifts blanketing wide-open range . We rode five hours that day , the most any of us had ever logged in a saddle . When the Upper Hideout finally came into view at 8,200 feet , it was as though we had reached Valhalla . And actually , aside from being sore in spots we never knew existed , it was pretty great . Flitner 's chefs , Robb Howe and Anthony Larsen , had driven up that morning ( two hours by dirt road ) and worked away in the kitchen all afternoon . Our hosts , David and Paula Flitner , piloted themselves up in their Bell Jet Ranger helicopter , landing just in time for cocktails and dinner . We all emerged from our handsome log cabins , freshly showered and changed ( our bags had been trucked up earlier ) , and fell upon Robb and Anthony 's ranch-raised beef and their decadent profiteroles with the undying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time the red wine had worked its warmth , the eight of us , who had barely known one another 's names that morning , had bonded completely . ( Of course , it was n't all easy : we had to climb back in the saddle the next day for the five  --  hour ride back down . ) My husband and I have landed at several guest ranches over the years , and we 've learned that none of them are alike . Of the ranches we 've fallen for , in Montana , Texas , New Mexico , Argentina and elsewhere in Wyoming , however , we 'd never encountered one as authentic as the Flitners ' . With more than 1,000 head of cattle , 160 registered quarter horses and 2,600 acres of alfalfa and hay , it is both a working ranch ( which has , amazingly , remained in the same family for five generations ) and a way of life . What makes this place so different is that visitors are allowed to enter the Flitners ' world completely . The cattle business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to be in these days . After three generations had worked ninety  --  six hard years at it ( David 's grandfather , Arthur Flitner , founded the Flitner Ranch in 1906 ) , the Flitners recently decided to host paying guests and built the Hideout to house them . Consisting of a sumptuous main lodge , five two  --  bedroom log cabins done up in practical plaids and braided rugs and a separate building , the Casita , which holds four additional one-bedroom suites with living rooms , efficiency kitchens and front-porch views of cottonwoods and cliffs , plus a gorgeous riding barn , the Hideout is a serious spread . The property , traversed by paved walkways that round swaths of emerald  --  green grass , is a bit too manicured for my taste . But that 's just me . The main lodge , a symphony of logs soaring to a peaked roof over the great room 's towering stone fireplace , fulfilled my every Big Valley fantasy . And at the end of a day in the saddle , there is something inexpressibly satisfying about sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beside a massive fire , knowing that in the kitchen , the chefs are putting the finishing touches on yet another memorable meal . One of the Hideout 's unexpected highlights is the time you get to spend with the Flitners , who exemplify the kind of roll-up-your-sleeves and do  --  whatever-it-takes spirit with which the great ranches of this country were built . David went east to school ( Dartmouth ) , but returned to Wyoming in 1960 to work the ranch . Seven years later , he became the head of the Wyoming Farm Bureau . Paula is from Belgium ; she and David met in the early ' 90s , when both were assigned the same seat on a flight from Dulles to Denver . David invited Paula to the ranch to experience an " authentic cowboy adventure " ; she was so adept at pitching in that one of the old-time ranch hands said , " Dave , you are crazy if you do n't marry that gal . She is one hell of a hand "  --  the ultimate compliment in Wyoming . A decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European style , wearing crisp blouses around the property , where she is constantly trailed by two very unranchlike poodles , Tiger and Bear . At dinner , David told stories about the pioneer women of the Flitner clan that were so detailed you expected his late grandmother Anna Flitner , founding president of the local Shell Creek Women 's Club , to walk into the room . He 'd also recount what it was like to grow up on the ranch : how his father would wake his brother and him at 4:00 A.M. to drive cattle before school . Hearing these tales made me think about the pioneering women in my own family , who crossed the plains in covered wagons or helped found lumber towns in northern California , back when it seemed the redwoods would last forever . Inspired , I set my alarm clock one night for 5:30 the next morning-not that I had any cattle to round up yet , but at least I could watch the sunrise with the cowhands . Whether you 're an experienced rider or an absolute greenhorn , a Flitner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main lodge . Then , depending on whether you 've signed up for a full day 's cattle work or an " easy " day , you 'll help with calving , branding , herding or checking the grazing conditions and fences , or take a three-hour ride in the morning and a nap that afternoon . But ride you will-and should . Around six , cocktails are poured in the lodge 's loft , and ranch manager Julie Cote checks in with the guests , getting the word on their horses , their saddles and whether they plan to sign on for another full day 's cattle work . " There 's an option of taking an easy day every day , just because the riding can be pretty intense , " Julie confides . " Believe me , by the time people show up for cocktails , they know whether or not they want to be in that saddle . " Those seeking a complete break can shop for boots , belt buckles and other western accessories in the nearby town of Greybull , go a bit farther afield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take an airboat ride on the Bighorn River or explore some of the area 's world-renowned dinosaur sites . However , anyone seeking a variety of activities-tennis , golf , guided fly  --  fishing or an organized kids ' programwill be disappointed by the Hideout , as it is first and foremost a working ranch , not a ranch resort . I was n't at all sure about the cattle work . I pictured myself galloping alongside a thundering herd , hanging on to my saddle horn , consumed in a cloud of dust , but I discovered it was n't like that at all . " The only fast way to round up cattle is slow , " advised one of the Hideout 's two long-legged wranglers , Keith , as we rode off in search of stray Black Angus . Far from being scary , herding cattle was strangely satisfying . Cows , we learned , are inherently lazy . It was our job simply to find them and , keeping our horses aligned in a sort of moving wedge , push them uphill  --  which we managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first  --  timers who had never ridden before and had a magnificent time : an advertising executive from New York who showed up to ride in black loafers and a black leather jacket ; and Alan , a young lawyer from Atlanta with a dry wit , who was assigned a horse named Buttermilk after being demoted from his first mount , Velvet . " You do n't have to watch that , Buttermilk , " Alan would counsel his docile beast when wrangler Keith 's horse , Stormin ' Norman , seemingly possessed , would buck and snort . Back at the ranch , we 'd all congratulate ourselves on a job well done and linger over the evening slide show : photos taken daily by the Hideout 's fulltime photographer . ( In a posh Hideout touch , guests are given a week 's worth of digital images on departure . ) We might have been bow-legged , but you can bet we were happy . As projected onto the Hideout 's big screen during cocktails , we looked every bit the Marlboro Men and Women we imagined ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 82441 ; 307-765-2080 or 800-354-8637 ; thehide out.com .
