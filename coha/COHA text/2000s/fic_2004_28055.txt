Chapter One Dante Pontis was n't the most patient of creatures . And his patience was quickly running out . He 'd been trapped in a limo from Hartsfield Airport to the hotel with his brothers , Mike and Leo , as they bitched and moaned over the fact that Dante had forced the two young panthers to fly coach from Minnesota to Atlanta while he and Romeo had simply " flashed " themselves here . And all because the last time he and Romeo had psychically transported the twins somewhere , they had caused such a scene on arrival that they 'd almost gotten busted by the humans . Dragon*Con was far too crowded to take a chance on the four of them " appearing " before so many witnesses . The key to Were-Hunter survival was to blend in with the humans , not scare the shit out of them . " You know , " Romeo said to them , " you 're both lucky I would n't let Dante trank you and send you over in a cage . It 's what he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snarled at Dante as he raked him with a repugnant glare . At six feet four , the panther was still growing and would probably equal Dante 's height of six feet six in the next decade or so . Leo and Mike were identical twins whom Dante had raised after their mother had abandoned them on their father 's doorstep . It was typical Were-Panther behavior . The women would mate with the men , get pregnant , then leave the cubs for the men to raise while the women prowled around unfettered . If the cubs were daughters , they would remain in the male-dominated pack until puberty , which struck them around the age of twenty-four . Then all the " seasoning " female cubs would form their own group and leave to search for mates . In the last two hundred years , Dante and Romeo had raised a large number of cubs , since their father was famous for dumping his litters on them and heading for the hills . Like Dante , the twins had wavy black hair and tawny Italian skin when in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , which in their life span made them practically children . And they acted it . It was time to either kill them or get away from them . Since Romeo was still rather bent over the fact that Dante had killed off their brother Salvatore for betraying them , Dante decided it would be best to get to his room before Leo and Mike joined Salvatore as skins on the wall at his club . " I do n't understand why I have to share a room with Leo , " Mike snarled . " He snores . " " I do not . Besides , you whistle when you sleep . " " No I do n't . " Dante passed an irritated look at Romeo . " Why are they here ? " " To get women , " Mike said . Romeo ignored him . " You were afraid to leave them alone at the Inferno without me . The last time you did that , they damn near burned the place down . " Dante expelled a disgusted breath . " And why ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Yeah , right . Dante snorted at that as he handed off the card key to Leo and Mike . " Wait , wait , wait , wait , " Leo said as he examined it . " These are n't concierge level . " Dante gave him a bored stare . " Are you concierge ? " Leo asked Romeo . " Yes . " " Why are n't we concierge ? " Mike asked Dante . Dante crossed his arms over his chest . " Because you 're unworthy . " Mike opened his mouth to speak , but before he could , a trace of a scent washed over all three of them instantaneously . Dante went rigid as every hormone in his body suddenly became activated and sizzled . Against his will , he found himself turning around and scanning the crowd in the hotel lobby . He smelled a virgin pantheress in heat . They all did . The scent was unmistakable . It was warm and sweet . Feminine and innocent . Succulent . Inviting . And it made him salivate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it scanned the females present and detected none of his kind . " Where is she ? " Leo said , his voice ragged as if he were having a hard time holding himself back . " Too many humans here to tell , " Mike said as he tilted his head back to sniff the air . " They have her scent moving in multiple directions . " Dante passed a look to Romeo , who was staring up at the elevator . He turned to stare as well , and saw no one but Darth Vader . " Did you see her ? " he asked . Romeo shook his head . " Sorry . I was mesmerized by the naked green alien . " " Arrr , " Mike snarled . " You 're worthless , Romeo . What kind of panther gets fixed on an alien when there 's a virgin pantheress in heat ? " " A mated one , " Romeo shot back . " Unlike you losers , my hormones are contained . " Dante sniffed and shook his head to clear it of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same childish antics as his twin brothers . " Yeah , and I want to keep mine that way . Frick and Frack , you 're on panther patrol . Find her and keep her far away from me . " Mike and Leo exchanged evil grins before they bolted into the crowd . Dante rolled his eyes at their haste . There were times when they really were losers . " Are n't you the least bit interested ? " Romeo asked as they headed for the elevators . " It 's not every day we run across a virgin panther . " " Hell , no . I 'll stick to humans . The last thing I want is a mate who 'll cruise into my life once a year , screw my brains out for two days , then run off until she delivers my litter to me to raise without her . No offense , being you and Dad sucks and I 've raised enough siblings to never want to raise my own young without the benefit of a mate . " Romeo laughed . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days . " Dante shook his head at him . " You can have it . I 'd rather take my pleasure where and when I find it . " He entered the elevator , then paused as he realized Romeo was n't joining him . " I 'll catch you later , " he said . " You sure ? " Romeo nodded . " All right . " Dante got in and pushed the button for his floor . He stepped back against the glass and did his best to bring his body back under control . But it was hard . Every animal instinct he possessed demanded that he stalk this hotel until he located the female . Since he was a Katagari Were-Hunter , the need to copulate with her was almost overwhelming . Katagaria were animals who could take human form , but at the end of the day , they were animals and not humans . Their animal half ran roughshod over their human sensibilities and it was the animal heart inside them that ruled them and their actions . What he needed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal form and put the female out of his mind . He was old enough to be able to curtail his nature . To control it . He was n't about to let any woman have control over him . Especially not a pantheress . Pandora fumbled with her key card as she struggled to open her door . What was she going to do ? The man in her elevator was n't Acheron . And those had been panther males down there . If they caught another whiff of her ... She was doomed . There was no way the animal inside her would refuse a virile male . She was in heat and the need to mate reigned supreme inside her . If any male came near her who her animal self sensed could possibly impregnate her , she would throw herself at him . Around humans , that impulse was controllable . The chances of a human male being her mate were almost impossible . So the animal inside her might be curious and enticed , but it would stand down to her human rationale . Around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would pounce for a taste of the male . She would have no control ! A shadow fell over her . Pandora squeaked and jumped back as she looked up to see one of the men she 'd seen downstairs . This close to him , she could n't mistake his Panthiras attributes . His scent was undeniable . He was lean and powerful in human form . Deadly . His handsomeness would guarantee him any female who caught his interest ... even her own feminine senses reacted to him , but not so much that she could n't fight him . Even more frightening than his innate feral masculinity , his scent was Katagaria-the animal branch of their species-while she was Arcadian , the human branch . Letting go of her room card , she crouched to attack and was amazed that the animal inside her was n't leaping out to mate with him . " It 's okay , " he said quickly . " I 've got good news and bad news for you . " " And that is ? " He held his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his palm . At least that explained why she could resist the urge to copulate with him . " I 'm mated so you 're completely safe from me . " Pandora still was n't ready to trust him , but at least as a mated panther , he would n't be able to have sex with her . Once a Were-Panther male was mated , he was impotent around any female other than his " wife . " " I take it that 's the good news ? " He nodded . " And the bad ? " " I 'm here with three brothers who are n't . " She started to bolt . " No , no , " he said , reaching out to take her hand . He pulled back before he did . " Do n't be afraid of me . I really mean you no harm , okay ? I have ten daughters myself and I understand your fear . " She still was n't ready to trust that he would n't take her to his brothers for their enjoyment . That was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of becoming a community toy for every unmated male in their pack . " What do you want ? " " Believe it or not , I 'm going to help you . " She chose not to believe that . At least not yet . " Why would you do that ? " " Because of my daughters , " he said sincerely . " You 're just a baby and I do n't trust Leo or Mike not to hurt you . They would n't do it on purpose , but they 're young too and not real good at holding back . No doubt they 'd both pounce on you at once and who knows what they might inadvertently do . " And that was exactly what she was afraid of . " That 's only two brothers . What of the third ? " " Dante 's different . Honestly , you 'd be lucky to find someone like him for your first . He 's a selfish bastard who does n't like to share much of anything with anyone and he 'd make sure no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But his brother was still an animal and she had no interest in taking a Katagari lover . " Is that supposed to comfort me ? " she asked . He shook his head . " No , but do n't worry . Dante 's a lot older than they are and , lucky for you , he does n't want a mate . He plans to stay far away from you so I can keep him off you by simply telling him where you are . " Pandora calmed a degree . He was telling her the truth , she could sense it . One of the good things about being part animal was that she knew whenever someone was lying to her . " Okay , " she said slowly . " Thank you for your offer to help . I do n't want a Katagari to touch me . " His nostrils flared at that . She stiffened . " You said it yourself . You get carried away and you hurt us . My older sister was killed by a pack of Katagaria males who snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my age . I 'm barely twenty-four . I do n't want to die . Not like that . " That seemed to calm him down . He bent over and retrieved her card from the floor . " Get me something with your scent on it so I can spread it around and keep Leo and Mike away from you . " Pandora nodded , then opened the door to her room . She went to her suitcase and pulled out the T-shift she slept in . " Do you know Acheron Parthenopaeus ? " she asked as she handed it to him . " Yes , why ? " " I was told to find him . My surviving sister said that he could help me get home again . " The panther frowned at her . " I do n't understand , why did n't you go home on your own ? " She sighed as frustration filled her . How she wished it were that simple . If she were an older pantheress , she could easily find her own way home , but her kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first mating . Even then her powers would have to be trained and honed so that she could wield them . That was something that could take decades , if not centuries , to master . " I was kidnapped from the future by a group of Katagaria panthers and brought to this time period against my will . Unfortunately , my powers are just starting and I have no control over them or any way home on my own until I master them . The last thing I want is to overshoot my time period or end up with the dinosaurs . " He looked at her suspiciously . " I still do n't understand why they took you . Why go to the future for a mate when there are plenty of packs here ? " She clenched her fists at that . " It 's some stupid pact my pack made with theirs . Since we seem to have an abundance of females , my pack agreed to sacrifice a number of females every generation from certain families so that the Katagaria panthers would leave the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born females in the chosen families starts to season , the same pack comes to our home and brings us to their time period to mate with them . They do n't want Katagaria females since they wo n't stay and raise their young . They keep us instead and use us as slaves . My one surviving sister helped me to escape after they brought me here before they could induct me into their pack . She sent me to Atlanta to find Acheron . She said he could return me to my time period . " " How does she know Acheron ? " Pandora ached at the thought that she would benefit from her sister 's misery . " Before she was mated to one of their males and had her own children , she was trying to escape their pack . One night , she overheard some of the Katagaria talking about a Dark-Hunter named Acheron , and after they went to sleep , she searched for him online . By the time she found out enough information to locate him , she was pregnant and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information to me once they brought me over . " " Hell of a sister you have there . " " Yes , " Pandora agreed . " She 's the best sister in the world and I would give anything if I could help her too . " The panther stepped back with a sigh , then started for the door . She took his arm to keep him from leaving as another thought occurred to her . " Could you help me get home ? " He shook his head . " My powers are n't quite that strong . If I wanted to take anyone other than myself across time , I would have to wait for the full moon . The only one in my pack who could do it without waiting is Dante and if you get near him- " " I 'll attack him for sex . " He nodded . Damn . At least all was n't lost though . " But you do know Acheron , right ? Will he help me ? " " I do n't know . He 's strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to react or what he 's going to do or say . But you can always ask .
