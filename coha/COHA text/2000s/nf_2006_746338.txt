A little while ago my old friend Wilbur Zelinsky was about to present a paper at the Pennsylvania State Geography Department 's weekly coffee hour . Our young colleague Lorraine Dowler , who introduced him , began by telling the overflowing audience that they were about to hear from one of geography 's greatest " icons . " I was struck by Lorraine 's use of the word , because Wilbur Zelinsky had been an icon to me long before I ever met him  --  and that was back in the early 1960s . In fact , Wilbur Zelinsky was one of the few icons that I knew about in geography , although I did not think to call him that . One of the first articles by a geographer that really hit me where I lived was a short piece published in a relatively obscure journal called Social Forces . The essay was titled simply , " Where the South Begins " ( Zelinsky 1951 ) . Wilbur started by asking the most obvious of questions in American regional geography : We all know that the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just where is it ? Where are its boundaries ? When a traveler approaches the South , where does it begin ? <p> He started out by using his eyes , looking at the differences in human landscape along the borderland of the South . Using one 's eyes was a Zelinsky trademark that I particularly admired . Then he went to the library and pored over all kinds of statistics  --  another Zelinsky trademark ! But most of what he found did not make much sense when you went out into the field and actually looked at the human landscape . You could see where the South began , somewhere in the middle of Virginia . Southern Virginia was in the South ; northern Virginia was not ; and the line across the middle was fairly clear . But short of 2,000 miles of fieldwork , what other measure could be found that would define the boundary elsewhere ? Wilbur kept plowing through the census and whatever other numbers he could find , and guess what ? The South began where the ratio between mules and horses tipped on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on horsepower , whereas farmers in the South relied on mules . <p> To me , at the time a puling graduate student at the University of Michigan , but a student who had crossed that North-South boundary a good many times on family trips and tried to figure out what I was looking at , Zelinsky 's insight seemed a vision from on high . Geographers at the time were incessantly writing about regions like the South , but nobody had bothered to go out and look , and then check what they saw against one of the most basic of measures . I was awestruck that somebody would have the naive good sense to see and do what Zelinsky did . Here was a man who was willing to go outdoors , use his eyes , and then return to the library and sort through a mass of data to find a match between statistics and landscape . <p> Mules and horses were just the beginning of my private admiration for this icon . In 1961 there appeared a massive , close to sixty-page article in the Annals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of America 's most defining elements : religion . It depicted American religion geographically in a series of brilliant maps and truly revealed some of the most basic cultural patterns in the nation 's geography ( Zelinsky 196a ) . Zelinsky had compiled sectarian membership data on a host of religious bodies by county and then , by hand , had drawn maps of where all the major religious sects in the United States were located . As one who was raised in a household that took religion seriously , and took ideas seriously too , it was a revelation to see displayed the distribution of Baptists , and Quakers , and Roman Catholics , and Methodists , and Jews , and Lutherans , and God knows how many others  --  maps that had literally been drawn by hand by this master of American cultural geography . The cartographic depictions were real eye-openers . Baptists defined the South . Methodists were everywhere  --  the closest thing to a national religion that it seemed we had . Episcopalians lived in cities , mostly in the East , and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable and revealing patterns . By then he was an icon all right , and one of my greatest geoheroes . <p> I finally met this icon at the meeting of the Association of American Geographers ( AAG ) in East Lansing , Michigan in 1961 , under very unheroic , very un-iconic circumstances . The AAG was still small enough so all of us could fit into places the size of East Lansing , and it was still possible for almost everybody to run into almost everybody else before the meeting was over . I found myself at a rather grungy table in a seedy East Lansing student pub , and there , across from me , was Zelinsky in person . I was almost tongue-tied , but I managed to mumble enough words to suggest that we shared a good many interests and that I admired him greatly . I suppose I was waiting for some Olympian utterance from this icon , this demigod . To my great surprise , he responded like an ordinary human being  --  and , to my even greater surprise , like a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant professors expected to find in their heroes , but there it was : a modest man who spoke English just like ordinary people and drank watery beer just like a graduate student . I was charmed , and I have remained charmed ever since . <p> I had come to Pennsylvania State University in 1958 to find a rather small and rightfully modest department of geography , populated by hardworking and mostly very nice people . But it was far from being a great department ; nor was Penn State in any league with the nation 's great universities . Both the department and Penn State were well aware of their limitations , but there was a catch : Both department and university were brimming with ambition to be better than they were , a great deal better than they were . The university , at some Olympian level , decided that the best way to improve , and to do so in a hurry , was to enrich the faculty by hiring some real " stars " and add them to departments that were known to be solid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were told that we could reach for the stars , so , amazed by our own derring-do , we extended an invitation to Zelinsky to leave Southern Illinois University and come to Penn State as a tenured full professor at the in-x962 unheard-of salary of $20,000 . <p> To be honest , none of us imagined that this great scholar , this academic lion , would conceive of coming to this cow college in the hills of Appalachia , even at such an astronomical salary . So we were stunned to find that he was sufficiently interested to come to the little Borough of State College and take a look at this place that had the presumption to invite him to join its faculty . <p> We watched in awe as Wilbur Zelinsky set about to hear the genuine lowdown , the real skinny , on the real estate market , the school system , the crime rate , the state of race relations , the condition of string quartets in the greater State College community , and , most important , the state of veterinary medicine in central Pennsylvania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love and cherish , revealed themselves as 1930s radicals , with views somewhere between those of Norman Thomas and Leon Trotsky . We also discovered that they were enthusiastic , nay fanatical , animal lovers , who moved from place to place trailing clouds of glory , but also cats  --  cats measured by the dozen , nay by the acre-foot . This explained the Zelinskys ' profound interest in the veterinarians of middle Pennsylvania . <p> As we stood in amazement at this microscopic examination of our little community , we  --  or , I should say I  --  wrung our hands in despair . I had no idea how good the schools were , nor the condition of string quartets in State College . I did know that the crime rate was fairly low . Nobody had been murdered within living memory . Instead , for example , one miscreant had been seized by the constabulary for the high crime of kicking lamp posts . Race relations were outstanding , inasmuch as there was virtually no minority population to relate with . But politically , central Pennsylvania seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Nixon by astronomical margins , whereas the population of genuine radicals seemed nonexistent . <p> What we did not know was that State College and Centre County seemed like paradise to Zelinsky and his family , who had left racist Georgia to move to semiracist Southern Illinois , where , evidently , the strains of a violin were to be heard only at country music stomps at the county fair . And so it was that in 1962 Zelinsky announced that he would accept Penn State 's invitation and join the faculty of geography . More than incidentally , Peter Gould arrived about the same time , and the Zelinsky-Gould combination raised the department 's reputation beyond our wildest dreams . <p> In Wilbur I found what I had already found at East Lansing : a modest , almost shy person , whose interests were breathtakingly wide and deep , yes , polymathic . I was utterly taken , and before long we became fast friends . Geographically , we were Siamese twins . Both of us loved to sally forth into the wilds of central Pennsylvania to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppies , noses to the ground , wagging our tails in search of some newfound wonder . Don Meinig and Fraser Hart joined us on one memorable field trip . For two weeks we wandered all over the Northeast and engaged in what I am tempted to call " intellectual cross-pollination . " We made permanent friendships , which I still call among my closest . <p> Mirabile dictu , Wilbur and I also discovered each other 's love of our English tongue , and of wonderful obscure words that had not been heard in common speech in living memory . We established a " word of the day " club and posted our findings on our office doors where others could share our logoleptic delights . We discovered , for example , a class of phenomena called " jerkinheads " and learned that some jerkinheads were fuscous , and we delighted in finding fuscous jerkinheads in obscure villages across Pennsylvania . We discovered that the word " panduriform " described objects shaped like violins , and Wilbur began to scan the world around him in search of panduriformia . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he seemed to take pleasure in the appellation , a fact that further endeared him to me . <p> Over the years I found him the finest of colleagues , a widely read man of sophisticated humor , with an enormous range of classical interests , a wider range of friends in sundry disciplines , and a knowledge of music that seemed to cover the whole classical genre from Mozart to Mozart . ( His strange aversion to Gilbert and Sullivan has always seemed to me a major character flaw , presumably offered up to the gods to avoid a charge of perfection . ) We learned to love Gladys and their wonderful daughters , Hollis and Karen . We mourned with the Zelinskys when Hollis was taken with an unknown malady that kept her bedridden for more than a decade . And we mourned again one awful morning when Gladys died and left Wilbur bereft . But all that time , professionally , he continued to behave like that adolescent puppy , searching out the wonders of the cultural geography of the United States  --  as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , the " land I have loved the most " ( Zelinsky 1973 , v ) . <p> I have heard it said that a person 's circle of friends can be estimated by the number of nicknames he or she has acquired over a lifetime . Wilbur Zelinsky is right up there when it comes to nicknames , or maybe pseudonyms . Some people just call him " Wilbur , " a rather formal appellation but not his real name . His given name , in Polish , translates as " Wolf , " which a good many of his friends call him . Then there is just " Z , " which identifies him within the Geography Department at Penn State . Or , more elaborately , " WZ , " which lends itself to various adaptations . <p> Long ago , when WZ was head of the Department of Geography  --  whose acronym was naturally " PSUDOG " ( Pennsylvania State University Department of Geography )  --  our winning intramural soccer team became known under Wilbur as the " WIZDOGS " Inspired in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agile young Brits from various football-crazy Midland schools , the Penn State WIZDOGS swept all before them in intramural competition , so effectively that our triumphant WIZDOG team had to be cloned into two WIZDOG teams , " WIZDOG ONE " and " WIZDOG TWO , " which ended up playing each other in the university finals . It was about that time that the National Academy of Sciences declared that the Department of Geography at the Pennsylvania State University possessed a graduate program second to none in the arena of American geography . I find it hard to believe that this would have happened without its happy moniker . Unfortunately , after Wolf had stepped down from the department headship  --  a relief to him and everyone else as well  --  the soccer teams withered and slithered into oblivion , never to be heard from again . <p> I am grateful to Wolf  --  one of the kindest and most generous of colleagues , a dear friend who has enriched my life and those of a host of colleagues both here and abroad . All power to WZ , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for a special session in tribute to Wilbur Zelinsky at the 2005 meeting of the Association of American Geographers . <p>
