The latest course on college rosters : Backlash 101 // CAROLYN BYERLY WENT INTO HER TENURE REVIEW fairly optimistic . A communications professor at Ithaca College in central New York , she had been assured by colleagues that she had a strong track record across the three areas that tenure committees examine : teaching , research , and service in professional and community activities . But when the decision came down last year , it was not in Byerly 's favor . While her dean and some members of the tenure review committee claimed that Byerly 's teaching skills were weak , another reason soon came out : several students had complained in their teacher evaluations that Byerly was bringing feminist , gay , and progressive agendas into the classroom . Byerly was stunned-Ithaca had originally offered her a job after asking her to present a teaching demonstration on gay and lesbian issues in the news . In the three years before her tenure application , student evaluations had been overwhelmingly positive . " I had been a feminist leader in politics for many years , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . " I wanted my students to consider a variety of ways of using their writing and journalism talents . If I bring this agenda into my classrooms responsibly , then academic freedom is supposed to guarantee my right to do it . " As Byerly quickly found out , academic freedom applies only to some people-namely , traditional male scholars and others willing to swim safely within the mainstream . " No one minds the study of gender issues anymore , " she says . " The problem is when you bring an activist angle with you and start challenging ideas , practices , and policies . " Carolyn Byerly has filed an antidiscrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , the first step toward a full-fledged lawsuit . She has also learned that her case is only one of many that point to a persistent backlash against feminist scholars in the academy-and in some cases , against women in general . It 's not that feminists have n't changed the ivory tower in the last 30 years . Women 's studies programs are flourishing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field . And Barbara Gold , a classics professor who is also an associate dean of faculty at Hamilton College in New York State , points to the profound impact she believes feminism has had on teaching methods , changing the classroom model from " stand up and read your notes " to increasingly collaborative and interactive approaches . The reality is that things are going to continue to change in academia , but it 's going to be a rocky ride . According to Department of Education projections , thousands of academics , mostly men and mostly white , will leave the profession over the next decade alone . Partly because these jobs are so prestigious and so fiercely fought over , the backlash against women in academia seems more intense than ever . And despite decades of anti-discrimination legislation , many institutions are still disguising sexist decisions behind the highly subjective veil of maintaining academic standards . University administrators , for instance , often complain that they simply can not find enough women and minority faculty who " qualify " for academic jobs . " They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel uncomfortable  --  that 's what they mean by qualified , " says Linda Mabry , an African American law professor who resigned from Stanford University in 1998 in disgust over its discriminatory practices . " If you take a feminist perspective or interject race , they 'll just say your work is substandard . Since they have so much power to define these standards , it 's really easy to walk away thinking that you are not up to the task . " Feminist scholars are commonly told that they publish in the wrong journals , their work is too unconventional , or the subject of their research cuts across too many disciplines and can not be properly assessed . Annis Pratt of the Academic Discrimination Advisory Board at the National Women 's Studies Association points out that many women academics are also kept in a perpetual revolving door that whirls them away from the tenure stream . Schools overload them with committee assignments , knowing that women are less likely to say no . Or they hire women who do n't look like they will succeed . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff hostility grinds them down . " Women think academia is a place populated by intellectuals who behave rationally , " Pratt reflects . " But this is not a merit parkway-it 's more like a big male gang grope . " Women who fight back face expensive lawsuits and derailed careers . Others choose to endure the subtler oppression of complicity and silence . In either case , the longstanding principles that are supposed to guide higher education , including academic freedom , are under attack . " The day has n't come where one is safe being an outspoken feminist on campus , " says Patty McCabe , director of the American Association of University Women 's Legal Advocacy Fund . Photograph // Gloria DeSole , who ran the affirmative action office at the State University of New York at Albany for nearly 25 years , says , " Many of us thought we would meet with resistance until we were understood . We did n't expect that once we were understood , we would meet with even more resistance because we would be challenging male definitions of academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , complaints about gender and race discrimination have become so bad that the Department of Labor is currently investigating grievances reportedly filed by up to 30 faculty members ( including Linda Mabry ) . The school 's $500 million federal funding is at risk , but Stanford has refused to admit that any problems exist . One woman , Colleen Crangle , has already won a court case against the university : last year , a jury awarded her $540,000 in damages . ( Stanford appealed , but recently agreed to a settlement . ) Crangle , a senior research scientist in the School of Medicine and the only woman in her department , says that when she protested the sexism directed at her , she was moved out of her office to a desk in a hallway , with no computer or phone . Then she was told by an associate dean that she had to play " girl Friday " to a male colleague in a parallel position . One day , she came to work and found a letter saying she had been fired because of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a federal grant that she herself had helped the university secure . Publicly , schools like to talk about how open they are to women and minorities , even though most are no longer required to practice any type of affirmative action . The numbers , however , tell a vastly different story . The most recent Department of Education statistics , from 1995 , reveal that the percent of women who currently have tenure is almost as low as it was in 1977 . Even as women with Ph.D . ' s reach parity with men , full professors across all schools and disciplines are overwhelmingly male ( 79 percent ) and white ( just under 90 percent ) . ( The number of full-time faculty of color increased by 47.7 percent from 1985 to 1995 , but they still make up a very small percentage of all academics . ) And since 1975 , the disparities between male academics ' salaries and women 's have actually increased . Some feminist scholars argue that the skewed numbers result partly from the economics of academia . Public funding for education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the humanities , where women are disproportionately represented . This has led schools to make choices  --  with many assuming that as long as feminists have a women 's studies department , that 's enough . Annette Kolodny , a professor of comparative cultural studies at the University of Arizona , contends that downsizing has meant that feminist scholars now fall low on the list of desirable hires-at least for tenure-track positions . In general , the number of women academics has risen substantially in only one area : part-time jobs that offer no benefits or promise of longevity ( see " Road Scholar : Women in Academia , " Ms. February/March 2000 ) . Many untenured women note that they are afraid to speak out because they fear they may be targeted and never find another position . Several of the feminist scholars interviewed for this article who left their jobs and sued their universities over discrimination observed that they had later been replaced by " quieter " women academics . Making things even more difficult for progressives , many universities are accepting money from conservative organizations , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populated by conservative academics . And large private corporations have figured out that universities provide relatively cheap sources of research and development . Most of their money goes into fields with perpetually small numbers of women , such as the sciences . The women interviewed for this article could not recall a single instance of corporate support for feminist scholarship . The academy 's highly subjective performance standards have made it more difficult for women to protest unfair hiring practices than in other jobs . " It is like a medieval guild , with the idea that you ca n't impose external agendas on the sacred right of the scholarly community to pass judgment on who is admitted , " says Margit Stange , a feminist English scholar who last year won a four-year court battle against the University of California at Davis . And , as in the Byerly case , there is the growing practice of using anonymous student evaluations as part of the tenure review process . Administrators like to say that this encourages better teaching , but numerous studies show that students treat female professors less seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the National Women 's Studies Association reports that there have been many cases of students being asked by department chairs to write negative evaluations , or instances where positive evaluations were removed from a tenure candidate 's file . Some male academics do n't even bother to hide what they 're up to . At Eastern Kentucky University , Helen Eigenberg , a highly regarded criminal justice scholar , had been hired to bring a feminist presence to the school . But once she got there and began vying to become chair of her department , her male colleagues closed ranks behind a less qualified male candidate . Eigenberg filed a gender discrimination suit . In a deposition , one man unabashedly recalled slamming his fist on his desk and saying to a male colleague , " We got ta do her now . " Eigenberg and the school eventually settled in arbitration . For now , male academics can still look out for themselves at every turnthe associate dean at Stanford who Colleen Crangle says told her to play girl Friday to her male colleague went on to chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean there have n't been , and wo n't be , improvements at individual institutions . For example , MIT , which last year released a groundbreaking acknowledgement of the discrimination faced by women faculty in its Science School , has gone on to make systemic changes to improve the number of female faculty and the resources available to them . And hardly anyone is discounting the enormous impact of women becoming presidents of three Ivy League universities this year : the University of Pennsylvania , Brown , and Princeton , whose new president , Shirley M. Tilghman , a molecular biologist , has called on the federal government to deny funding to scientific meetings that do not include women on its panels . In other words , despite the backlash , women are making their presence felt . Gloria DeSole points to an experience at SUNY-Albany in the mid 1990s . As a senior adviser for affirmative action , DeSole went to see the white male chair of one of the science departments about an appointment that might not be in line with the school 's affirmative action goals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the issue up with the dean , a woman . If that did n't work , they could go up a level to the provost , another woman . Beyond that , there was always the college president , an African American man . DeSole watched as it dawned on the chair that there would be no one from the old boys ' network on his side . He chose not to go forward with the appointment . " There is enormous resistance to sharing power in the academy , and a deep antipathy to new ideas , " DeSole says . " But 20 years ago , everyone standing behind that chair would have been a white man . The world is shifting-too fast for some , not fast enough for others-but shifting nonetheless .

The branch beneath him sank and rose again , responding to his weight . Moist , hot air penetrated his finery , and he held his wings away from his brilliant blue sides . <br> " Too hot for company , " hemuttered , rocking back and forth from one scaly four-toed foot to the other on a limb of a sacktrass tree.The leaves shimmered as the motion rippled along the branch . " Where is <br> that girl ? " <br> His yellow head swiveled almost completely around . He peered with one eye down the overgrown path and then scoped out every inch within his range of vision , twisting his neck slowly . A brief morning shower had penetrated the canopy above and rinsed the waxy leaves . A few remaining drops glistened where thin shafts of tropical sun touched the dark green foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates lifted their fiery red petals , begging the thumb-sized bees to come drink before the weight of nectar broke off the blooms . <br> Beccaroon flew to a perch on a gnarly branch . He sipped from a broot blossom and ran his black tongue over the edges of his beak . A sudden breeze shook loose a sprinkle of leftover raindrops . Beccaroon <br> shook his tail feathers and blinked.When the disturbance settled , he cocked his head and listened . <br> " Ah ! She 's coming . " He preened his soft green breast and waited , giving a show of patience he did n't feel . His head jerked up as he detected someone walking with the girl . <br> " Awk ! " The sound exploded from his throat.He flew into a roost far above the forest floor , where he could n't be seen from the ground , and watched the approach of the girl placed under his guardianship . <br> Tipper strolled along the path below , wearing a flowing golden gown over her tall , lean body . She 'd put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown of her head . A golden chain hung from <br> each of her pointed ears . And she 'd decorated her pointed facial features with subdued colors  --  blue for her eyelids , rose for her lips , and a shimmering yellow on her cheeks . Beccaroon sighed . His girl was <br> lovely . <br> The bushes along the path behind her rustled . Beccaroon 's tongue clucked against his beak in disapproval . Hanner trudged after Tipper , leading a donkey hitched to a cart . The man 's shaggy hair , tied with a string at the back of his neck , hung oily and limp . Food and drink stained the front of his leather jerkin , and his boots woremud instead of a shine . The parrot caught a whiff of the o'rant from where he <br> perched . The young man should have carried the fragrance of citrus , but his overstrong odor reminded Beccaroon of rotten fruit . <br> A tree full ofmonkeys broke out in outraged chatter.Tipper , when alone , walked amid the animals ' habitat without causing alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You recognize a ninny-nap-conder when you see one . " He used the cover of the monkeys ' rabble-rousing to glide to another tree , where he could hide at a lower level . He had an idea where Tipper would lead Hanner . <br> " Here it is , " said the pretty emerlindian . She pulled vines from a clump , revealing a gray statue beneath . " My father named this one Vegetable Garden . " <br> Hanner pulled off more vines as he made his way slowly around the four-foot statue . " Vegetable Garden ? Mistress Tipper , are you sure you have the right one ? This is a statue of a boy reading a book . He 's not even chewing a carrot while he sits here . " <br> " Father used to say reading a good book was nourishment . " <br> Hanner scratched his head , shrugged his shoulders , and went to fetch the donkey and cart.Tipper 's head tilted back , and her blue eyes looked up into the trees . Her gaze roamed over the exact spot Beccaroon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eyelash did she betray whether she had seen him . Hanner returned . <br> Tipper spread out a blanket in the cart after Hanner maneuvered it next to the statue , then helped him lift the stone boy into the back . Hanner grunted a lot , and Tipper scolded . <br> " Careful Do n't break his armToo many vines still around the base . " <br> They got the statue loaded , and Tipper tucked the blanket overand around it . She then gave Hanner a pouch of coins . <br> " This is for your usual delivery fee . I could n't put in any extra for traveling expenses . I 'm sure you 'll be reimbursed by our buyer . " <br> He grunted and slipped the money inside his jerkin . <br> Tipper clasped her hands together . " Be careful . And give Master Dodderbanoster my regards . " <br> He tipped his hat and climbed aboard the cart . " I always am . And I always do . " <br> She stood in the path until the creak of the cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and sat on a thick branch wrapped with a leafless green creeper . The vine looked too much like a snake , so he hopped to another limb . <br> " Was that wise ? " he asked . <br> " I do n't think so either , Bec , butwhat else can I do ? I sell the artwork only as a last resort when we need quite a bit of cash . The well needs re-digging . " Tipper pulled a tight face , looking like she 'd swallowed <br> nasty medicine . " We 've sold almost everything in the house . Mother sees our things in the market and buys them back . Sometimes I get a better price for a piece the second time I sell it , and sometimes not . " <br> Beccaroon swayed back and forth on his feet , shaking his head . " She never catches on ? " <br> " Never . " Tipper giggled . " She shows remarkably consistent taste . When she spots something that was once ours , she buys it , brings it home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has always wanted something just like it . And she never notices pictures gone from the walls , rugs missing in rooms , chairs , tables , vases , candlesticks gone . I used to rearrange things to disguise a hole in the dTcor , but there 's no need . " <br> The sigh that followed her explanation held no joy.Tipper looked around . " There never is a place to sit in this forest when one wants to plop down and have a good cry . " <br> " You 're not the type to cry . I 'll walk you home . " Beccaroon hopped down to the path . His head came up to her waist . She immediately put her dainty hand on his topknot and smoothed the creamy plumes back . <br> " You 're the best of friends . Keeping this secret would be unbearable if I did n't have you to confide in . " <br> Beccaroon clicked his tongue . " No flattery , or I shall fly away . " <br> They moseyed back the direction Tipper had come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't like that greasy fellow . " <br> " I know . " Tipper gently twisted the longest feather from the center of Bec 's crest around her forefinger . <br> The grand parrot jerked his head away and gave her his sternest glare . She was his girl , but he still would n't let her take liberties . She did n't seem to notice he was disgruntled , and that further blackened <br> his mood . <br> " Hanner is all right , Bec . He takes the statues to Dodderbanoster . Dodderbanoster takes them to cities beyond my reach and gets a fair price for them . Sometimes I think the pouch Hanner brings back is <br> way too full . " <br> Beccaroon clicked his tongue . " Your father is a master artist . His work is worth a mighty price . " <br> " Hanner says sometimes Dodderbanoster sells them to a dealer who takes them even farther away , to thriving districts.Wealthy patrons bid to own a Verrin Schope work of art .

" <br> Beccaroon rolled his shoulders , causing his wings to tilt out , then settle against his sides . " What of your mother ? Does she ever mention your father 's absence ? " <br> " No , why should she ? He 's been gone for years , but she still sees him . She talks to him every night after his workday is done . Promenades through the garden with him .

Tipper picked a bloom , savored its spicy odor , then placed it behind one pointed ear . " Mother has an idea in her head . " <br> " For anyone else , the head is a splendid place to keep an idea . For your mother , she should just let them go . " <br> " She 's determined to visit her sister . " Tipper raised her eyebrows so that the upside-downV was even more pronounced . " She 'll go if she manages to pack her long list of necessities . Some of the items are quite unreasonable . " <br> Beccaroon snatched a nut from an open shell on the ground . He played the small nugget over his tongue , enjoying its sweetness , then swallowed . " And you ? Is she taking you ?
