The no-fly list of the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) is hitting increasingly bumpy skies . On the list are the names of people regarded as such serious threats that they should not be allowed on an airplane . Last month a United Airlines plane from London to Washington was forced to land in Maine because a barred passenger , Yusuf Islam , formerly known as the singer Cat Stevens , was onboard . Last week , in an unpublicized but potentially dangerous incident , a Royal Jordanian Airlines flight was allowed to take off from Amman with a Middle Eastern passenger whose name was on the list . Though U.S. officials discovered while the plane was en route that he was a no-fly passenger , the plane was permitted to land at its destination , Chicago 's O'Hare airport . <P> Industry sources tell TIME that in the past few months there have been at least a dozen incidents of no-fly passengers mistakenly being allowed to fly . The situation is overstretching law-enforcement personnel , who must scramble to respond to each incident . The nofly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones are added daily . There are dead people and people in prison on the list . At least 1,000 names are duplicates . Checking the unwieldy list has caused airline computer systems to crash . The TSA will not comment on specific incidents , but spokesman Mark Hatfield says the agency is hopeful its new passenger-prescreening program , Secure Flight , which begins next month , will help reduce the problems .  --  By Sally B.
