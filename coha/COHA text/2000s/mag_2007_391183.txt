Sidebar WATCH FOR MERCURY before dawn as the innermost planet puts on its best morning show of 2007 . ASTRONOMY : ROEN KELLY Sidebar THE MOON PASSES VENUS before dawn November 5 . The lunar crescent paired with the sky 's brightest point of light will appear grand through binoculars or with the unaided eye . ASTRONOMY : ROEN KELLY Sidebar THE FARSIDE ROLLS INTO VIEW Pick up almost any book about observing , and you 'll read that the Moon always keeps the same face pointed toward Earth . It 's a nice story , but not totally true . This month , you can peer past 90 east longitude to see Mare Australe . Because the Moon 's orbit is elliptical and not perpendicular to its rotation axis , we see a slight side-to-side and updown motion caWea iibration during the course of a month . In mid-November , the Moon 's southeastern limb tilts away from us , but it swings back into view by Full Moon the night of November 23/24 . Concentrate on the Moon 's southeastern limb . From the Northern Hemisphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region appears at lower right as we see the Moon with binoculars or the unaided eye . The double-rayed splotch of bright surface material near the limb emanates from the craters Stevinus A and Furnerius A. The bright chip of Janssen K lies in the direction of the south pole . Notice how close these features areto the lunar limb . Return each night to watch them move away from the edge . One week later , part of the huge , lava-filled impact basin called Mare Australe takes their place . It 's pretty cool that in the space of a single week , a completely hidden lunar feature rolls into prominent view . MARE AUSTRALE normally stays out of sight , but it creeps into view around November 's Full Moon . CONSOLIDATED LUNAR ATLAS/UA/LPL LEO ROARS WITH BRIGHT METEORS The Moon 's absence makes this a good year for Leonid meteors . The shower peaks the morning of November 18 , and the First Quarter Moon sets when the radiant rises , around midnight local time . Under a dark sky , meteor rates should range from 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 A.M. Although astronomers do n't expect a major outburst , East Coast observers may see heightened activity before midnight November 17 , when Earth crosses the orbital node of the Leonids ' parent comet , 55P/Tempel-Tuttle . In the hour or two before dawn , Leonids strike Earth 's atmosphere head on . This results in many bright events and some fireballs ( meteors brighter than magnitude -4 ) . Fireballs easily pierce twilight , so keep watch as the stars fade with dawn 's approach . LEO THE LION hosts the Leonid meteor shower , which peaks this year in a moonless morning sky . ASTRONOMY : ROEN KELLY Sidebar JUPITER AND ITS MOONS put on a final show in November 's evening sky before disappearing in the Sun 's glare . Although the planet 's cloud bands will be hard to see , the four Galilean moons should stand out . MIKE SALWAY Sidebar CATCH THIS BINOCULAR BEAUTY As twilight deepens in late October and early November , use binoculars to scan above the Sun 's remnant glow for Comet C/2007 F1 ( LONEOS ) . This 6th-magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon up toward Jupiter . Catch it early - the view deteriorates rapidly after November 's first week as the comet heads back to the outer solar system . You 'll need a telescope to see delicate features in the comet 's two tails . The dust tail usually appears brightest . Its glow comes from sunlight scattering off dust lifted off the comet 's nucleus by jets of sublimating ice . This yellowish fountain curves gradually toward the north as the dust particles assume their own orbital paths around the Sun . On the comet 's southeastern flank ( left as seen from the Northern Hemisphere ) , a sharp streak heads straight away from the Sun . This is the ion tail , a collection of molecules ionized by the Sun 's ultraviolet radiation and carried away by charged particles in the solar wind . The ion tail glows blue , although you should n't expect to see color unless the tail is particularly bright or you have a large scope . COMET C/2007 Fl ( LONEOS ) appears low in the southwest after sunset in early November . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it returns to the outer solar system . ASTRONOMY : ROEN KELLY Sidebar WHEN TO VIEW THE PLANETS EVENING SKY Jupiter ( southwest ) Uranus ( south ) MIDNIGHT Mars ( east ) Uranus ( west ) MORNING SKY Mercury ( east ) Venus ( southeast ) Mars ( west ) Saturn ( southeast ) MARS BACKS UP in November as it begins retrograde ( westward ) motion in Gemini . With just a month to go before opposition , the Red Planet shines brightly from late evening on . ASTRONOMY : ROEN KELLY Sidebar DESPERATELY SEEKING CERES With a little effort this month , you can trace part of an asteroid 's retrograde loop . Simply grab your binoculars and step into the backyard for a few minutes every couple of nights . Asteroid 1 Ceres , the biggest object in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter , glows at magnitude 7.2 at opposition November 9 . Ceres floats in front of the sparse star field in the tail of Cetus the Whale , which lies due south around local midnight . The asteroid appears brighter than all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow through binoculars on a night-by-night basis . Place the bright star Alpha ( a ) Ceti at the field 's bottom , then look to the top . Use the chart above to identify surrounding stars and hone in on Ceres . With a diameter of nearly 600 miles , the asteroid has enough gravity to shape itself into a sphere . That 's why the International Astronomical Union last year raised Ceres ' status to " dwarf planet , " one step below planethood . Two centuries ago , astronomers classified Ceres as a planet before they recognized it as the largest of many objects with similar orbits . Sicilian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered Ceres January 1 , 1801 , when he noticed a " star " unaccounted for in catalogs . Like Mars , Ceres has a somewhat elliptical orbit , although the asteroid takes more than twice as long as Mars - 4.6 years - to complete a solar circuit . DWARF-PLANET CERES peaks this month as it reaches opposition . The asteroid glows at 7th magnitude in Cetus , where it will be easy to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratcliffe is the former president of the International Planetarium Society .
