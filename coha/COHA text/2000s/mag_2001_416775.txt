" Selections from the Allan Chasanoff Ceramic Collection , " an exhibition at the Mint Museum of Craft+ Design in Charlotte , North Carolina ( November 4 , 2000-May 27 ) , presented 153 objects from the 403 works the collector donated to the museum in 1995 . In the museum 's handsome catalog for the show , ceramics historian Garth Clark observes thatthis collection , acquired with the advice of the ceramist Raymon Elozua , is distinguished by its attention to content Chasanoff keeps lists of concepts that interest him and buys accordingly . " Ultimately , " writes Clark , " he collects the cultural language of ceramics , and this approach makes his collection unique . " Curator Mary F. Douglas points out that the exhibition reflects Chasanoff 's fascination with morphology and with morphing , the transformation of one form into another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an overall theme , " she writes , " it is the collector 's interest in multiple views .... To this end , multiple identity , metamorphosis , and fragmentation are major themes that run throughout this collection . " While the exhibition was organized into thematic clusters , as are the catalog and a Web site where the exhibition can be viewed , the thrill of encountering the collection lies in the ways in which these objects reverberate with one another. * The works differ widely in style , technique and mood . There are homages to Asian traditions , assemblages incorporating found objects , works simulating other materials , and objects that are abstract , realistic , comic , satirical , mysterious , disturbing . Many are humorous , such as Peter Vandenberge 's Watching Saturday Night Movies , 1970 , depicting two root vegetables snuggled up in an armchair , or Clayton Bailey 's Cyclops Skull , 1975 , an oversized pseudo-archaeological object . Wit turns ghoulish in Justin Novak 's Free Market 1996 , in which masked figures eat the entrails of a human sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays the many aspects of ceramics , it explores this art 's deep sources as well . David Regan 's Garden of Eden Tureen , 1992 , plays on the contrast between a functional object and a holy one ( words and images from Genesis ) . Like a medieval stained-glass window , the tureen brings religious concerns to everyday life ; but , as a modern object , it resonates with wit and irony . Adam and Eve are juxtaposed with images of copulating animals . An oversized apple with tooth-marks forms the finial of the tureen , and a snake wraps around its length forming the handles . The lid bears the sculptured jawbones of Adam and Eve ( and , thanks to their encounter in the Garden , each jaw has wisdom teeth ) . But Regan 's tureen relates a second genesis story with its inscription : " And the Lord God formed a man of the dust of the ground , and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils . " What does the ceramic artist do but create figures from the dust of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth MacDonald 's Flight , 1979 , is embedded with real bones , suggesting a bird fossil . Janet Neuwalder has created what looks like a geological section in Pine Cone Strata , 1989 , by forming clay over paper , leaves and pine cones . Both Arnold Zimmerman , in Untitled , 1984 , and Len Eichler , in Conglomerate Vessel#22 , 1988 , have constructed vessels out of shards and remnants that seem to belong to another time . And Stephen DeStaebler s evocations of ancient temple sculptures , Seated Woman With Quartered Abdomen and Standing Man With Navel Slit , both 1978 , look backward to art 's ritual origins . Other works allude to the process of artistic creation . The rabbit in Arthur Gonzalez 's sculpture Mose , 1985 , holds two tablets , one displaying a biological heart the other a flat red valentine . Like Moses coming down from Mount Sinai , the rabbit brings a revelation : the artist transmutes the real world into symbolic forms . The tablets record the revelation and also mimic an artist 's mold ; the extra-long ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow of Moses by that great transmuter of symbols , Michelangelo . Michelangelesque creation is also evoked in Sergei Isupov 's Stag Part or Looking Through Darkness , 1998 , which portrays a mysterious animal that morphs into a human head and gives birth to a fetus-like figure . On the animal 's back and flanks are painted bodies that float toward the viewer like the forms on the Sistine Chapel ceiling . The collections intellectual underpinnings are particularly well expressed in Raymon Elozua 's #10 Trestles , 1979 , which , like so many in the exhibition , is a work of trompe I'oeil and also of fantasy . From a distance it looks like a high school physics project ( toothpick bridge ) , or apart of a model-train set , but on closer inspection the sculpture becomes a memento mori ( like John Defazio 's head/skull in Lust Teapot , 1991 ) . It is a decaying ruin , where broken train tracks hang by a thread and dust covers everything . A crumbling billboard in the background displays two signs : " E-Z " and " 4-D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows us the remnants of a disappearing civilization , fragmented like " The Waste Land , " haunted like the desolate cityscapes of The Great Gatsby . Traditional sculpture is also deconstructed in REAC , 1985 , created by Allan Chasanoff himself . Here a shiny teapot rests on shards of crockery , bursting out of its form and color as we watch . Each ceramic surface is morphing , transforming itself into something different , encapsulating a persistent theme of this collection . After trying his hand at making a teapot , Chasanoff wenton to collect dozens of variations on the theme : cubist teapots by Paul Mathieu and Jeff Perrone , a fragmented one by Marek Cecula , an open-work teapot by Patrick Hilferty , a Kenneth Ferguson piece resembling an udder , an armor-clad version by Christopher Staley , one by Lu Wen Xia identified as Buddha 's Hand , and more . An anthropomorphic shape , the teapot is an everyday object and a site of fantasy , and it lends itself , asthe collection attests , to endless interpretation .
