BY THE END OF HIS SECOND month at Hitode Station , Rob Freeman had already come up with eighty-five ways to murder Henri Kerlerec . That put him third in the station 's rankings - Josef Palashnik was first with one hundred forty-three , followed by Nadia Kyle with ninety-seven . In general , the number and sheer viciousness of the suggested methods was in proportion to the amount of time each spent with Henri . <p> Josef , as the primary submarine pilot , had to spend upward of thirty hours each week in close quarters with Henri , so his list concentrated on swift and brutal techniques suitable for a small cockpit . Nadia shared lab space with Henri - which in practice meant she did her dissections in the kitchen or on the floor of her bedroom - and her techniques were mostly obscure poisons and subtle deathtraps . <p> Rob 's specialty was underwater photography and drone operation . All through training he had been led to expect he would be filming the exotic life forms of Ilmatar , exploring the unique environment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alien biology and ecology . Within a week of arrival he found himself somehow locked into the role of Henri Kerlerec 's personal cameraman , gofer , and captive audience . His list of murder methods began with " strangling HK with that stupid ankh necklace " and progressed through cutting the air hose on Henri 's dry suit , jamming him into a thermal vent , abandoning him in midocean with no inertial compass , and feeding him to an Aenocampus . Some of the others on the station who routinely read the hidden " Death To HK " board had protested that last one as being too cruel to the Aenocampus . <p> Rob 's first exposure to killing Henri came at a party given by Nadia and her husband Pierre Adler in their room , just after the support vehicle left orbit for the six-month voyage back to Earth . With four guests there was barely enough room , and to avoid overloading the ventilators they had to leave the door open . For refreshment they served melons from the hydroponic garden filled with some of Palashnik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hollow interior was empty , then cut vodka-flavored melon slices . <p> " I 've got a new one , " said Nadia after her third melon slice . " Put a piece of paper next to Le Nuke for a few months until it 's radioactive , then write him a fan letter and slip it under his door . He 'd keep the letter for his collection and die of gradual exposure . " <p> " Too long , " said Josef . " Even if he kept it in his pocket it would take years to kill him . " <p> " But you 'd have the fun of watching him lose his hair , " said Nadia . <p> " I would rather just lock him in the reactor shed and leave him there , " said Josef . <p> " Who are they talking about ? " Rob asked . <p> " Henri Kerlerec , " whispered the person squeezed onto the bed next to him . <p> " Irradiate his hair gel , " said Pierre . " That way he 'd put more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brain . " <p> " Ha ! That part has been dead for years ! " <p> " Replace the argon in his breathing unit with chlorine , " said someone Rob could n't see , and then the room went quiet . <p> Henri was standing in the doorway . As usual , he was grinning . " Planning to murder somebody ? Our esteemed station director , I hope . " He glanced behind him to make sure Dr. Sen was n't in earshot . " I have thought of an infallible technique : I would strike him over the head with a large ham or gigot or something of that kind , and then when the police come , I would serve it to them to destroy the evidence . They would never suspect ! " <p> " Roald Dahl , " murmured Nadia . " And it was a frozen leg of lamb . " <p> Henri did n't hear her . " You see the beauty of it ? The police eat the murder weapon . Perhaps I shall write a detective novel about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone ! " he gave a little wave and went off toward Hab Three . <p> This particular morning Rob was trying to think of an especially sadistic fate for Henri . Kerlerec had awakened him at 0500 - three hours early ! - and summoned him to the dive room with a great show of secrecy . <p> The dive room occupied the bottom of Hab One . It was a big circular room with suits and breathing gear stowed on the walls , benches for getting into one 's gear , and a moon pool in the center where the Terran explorers could pass into Ilmatar 's dark ocean . It was usually the coldest room in the entire station , chilled by the subzero seawater . <p> Henri was there , waiting at the base of the access ladder . As soon as Rob climbed down he slammed the hatch shut . " Now we can talk privately together . I have an important job for you . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Tonight at 0100 we are going out on a dive . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " What ? Why tonight ? And why did you have to get me up at five in the goddamned morning to have this conversation ? " <p> " It must be kept absolutely secret . " <p> " Henri , I 'm not doing anything until you tell me exactly what is going on . Enough cloak and dagger stuff . " <p> " Come and see . " Henri led him to the hatch into Hab Three , opened it a crack to peek through , then gestured for Rob to follow as he led the way to the lab space he shared with Nadia KyIe . It was a little room about twice the size of a sleeping cabin , littered with native artifacts , unlabeled disks , and tanks holding live specimens . Standing in the middle was a large gray plastic container as tall as a man . It was covered with stenciled markings in Cyrillic and a sky blue UNICA shipping label . <p> Henri touched his thumb to a lock pad and the door swung open to reveal a bulky diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had a sleek , seamless look . <p> " Nice suit . What 's so secret about it ? " <p> " This is not a common sort of diving suit , " said Henri . " I arranged specially for it to be sent to me . Nobody else has anything like it . It is a Russian Navy stealth suit , for deactivating underwater smart mines or sonar pods . The surface is completely anechoic . Invisible to any kind of sonar imaging . Even the fins are low-noise . " <p> " How does it work ? " Rob 's inner geek prompted him to ask . <p> Henri gave a shrug . " That is for technical people to worry about . All I care is that it does work . It must - it cost me six million Euros to get it here . " <p> " Okay , so you 've got the coolest diving suit on Ilmatar . Why are you keeping it locked up ? I 'm sure the bio people would love to be able to get close to native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I am done they can watch all the shrimps and worms they wish to . But first , I am going to use this suit to observe the Ilmatarans up close . Imagine it , Robert ! I can swim among their houses , perhaps even go right inside ! Stand close enough to touch them ! They will never notice I am there ! " <p> " What about the contact rules ? " The most frustrating part of the whole Ilmatar project was the ban on contacting the sentient natives of the planet . The UN committee in charge kept insisting more study was needed . Rob suspected maybe the UN was trying to appease the groups back on Earth that wanted to close down Hitode Station and pull back from Ilmatar . <p> " Contact ? What contact ? Did n't you hear - the Ilmatarans will not notice me ! I will stand among them , filming at close range , but with this suit I will be invisible to them ! " <p> " Doctor Sen 's going to shit a brick when he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out it will be done . What can he do to me ? Send me home ? I will go back to Earth on the next ship in triumph ! " <p> " The space agencies are n't going to like it either . " <p> " Robert , before I left Earth I did some checking . Do you know how many people regularly access space agency sites or subscribe to their news feeds ? About fifty million people , worldwide . Do you know how many people watched the film of my Titan expedition ? Ninety-six million ! I have twice as many viewers , and that makes me twice as important . The agencies all love me . " <p> Rob suspected Henri 's numbers were made up on the spur of the moment , the way most of his numbers were , but it was probably true enough that Henri Kerlerec , the famous scientist-explorer and shameless media whore , got more eyeballs than the rest of the entire interstellar program . <p> He could feel himself being sucked into the mighty whirlpool of Henri 's ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to get in any trouble . " <p> " You have nothing to worry about . Now , listen : here is what we will do . You come down here quietly at about 0030 and get everything ready . Bring the cameras and two of the quiet impeller units . Also a drone or two . I will get this suit on myself in here , and then at 01OO we go out . With the impellers we can get as far as the Maury 3 vent . There is a little Ilmataran settlement there . " <p> " That 's a long way to go by impeller . MauryS 's what , sixty kilometers from here ? " <p> " Three hours out , three hours back , and perhaps two hours at the site . We will get back at about 0900 , while the others are still eating breakfast . They may not even notice we have gone . " <p> " And if they do ? " <p> " Then we just say we have been doing some filming around the habitat outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container . " I tell you , they will never suspect a thing . Leave all the talking to me . Now : not another word ! We have too much to do ! I am going to sleep this afternoon to be fresh for our dive tonight . You must do the same . And do not speak of this to anyone ! " <p> Broadtail is nervous . he can not pay attention to the speaker , and constantly checks the reel holding his text . he is to speak next , his first address to the Bitterwater Company of Scholars . It is an audition of sorts - Broadtail hopes the members find his work interesting enough to invite him to join them . <p> Smoothshell 24 Midden finishes her address on high-altitude creatures and takes a few questions from the audience . They are n't easy questions , either , and Broadtail worries about making a fool of himself before all these respected scholars . When she finishes , Longpincer 16 Bitterwater clacks his pincers for quiet . <p> " Welcome now to Broadtail 38 Sandyslope , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient languages . Broadtail ? " <p> Broadtail nearly drops his reel , but catches it in time and scuttles to the end of the room . It is a wonderful chamber for speaking , with a sloped floor so that everyone can hear directly , and walls of quiet pumice stone . he finds the end of his reel and begins , running it carefully between his feeding-tendrils as he speaks aloud . His tendrils feel the knots in the string as it passes by them . The patterns of knots indicate numbers , and the numbers match words . he remembers being careful to space his knots and tie them tightly , as this copy is for the Bitterwater library . The reel is a single unbroken cord , expensive to buy and horribly complicated to work with - very different from the original draft , a tangle of short notes tied together all anyhow . <p> Once he begins , Broadtail 's fear dissipates . His own fascination with his topic asserts itself , and he feels himself speeding up as his excitement grows . When he pauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he supposes that is a good sign . At least they are n't all going torpid . <p> The anchor of his speech is the description of the echo-carvings from the ruined city near his home vent of Continuous Abundance . By correlating the images of the echo-carvings with the number markings below them , Broadtail believes he can create a lexicon for the ancient city builders . he reads the Company some of his translations of other markings in the ruins . <p> Upon finishing , he faces a torrent of questions . Huge old Roundhead 19 Downcurrent has several tough ones - he is generally recognized as the expert on ancient cities and their builders , and he means to make sure some provincial upstart does n't encroach on his territory . <p> Roundhead and some others quickly home in on the weak parts of Broadtail 's argument . A couple of them make reference to the writings of the dead scholar Thickfeelers 19 Swiftcurrent , and Broadtail feels a pang of jealousy because he ca n't afford to buy copies of such rare works . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his work , and struggles to retain his temper . The presentation may be a disaster , but he must remain polite . <p> At last it is over , and he rolls up his reel and heads for a seat at the rear of the room . He 'd like to keep going , just slink outside and swim for home , but it would be rude . <p> A scholar Broadtail does n't recognize scuttles to the lectern and begins struggling with a tangled reel . Longpincer sits next to Broadtail and speaks privately with shell-taps . " That was very well done . I think you describe some extremely important discoveries . " <p> " You do ? I was just thinking of using the reel to mend nets . " <p> " Because of all the questions ? Do n't worry . That 's a good sign . If the hearers ask questions it means they 're thinking , and that 's the whole purpose of this Company . I do n't see any reason not to make you a member . I 'm sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Broadtail - relief , excitement , and sheer happiness . he can barely keep from speaking aloud . His shelltaps are rapid . " I 'm very grateful . I plan to revise the reel to address some of Roundhead 's questions . " <p> " Of course . I imagine some of the others want copies , too . Ah , he 's starting . " <p> The scholar at the lectern begins to read a reel about a new system for measuring the heat of springs , but Broadtail is too happy to pay much attention . <p> AT MIDNIGHT , Rob was lying on his bunk trying to come up with some excuse not to go with Henri . Say he was sick , maybe ? The trouble was that he was a rotten liar . he tried to make himself feel sick-maybe an upset stomach from ingesting seawater ? His body unhelpfully continued to feel okay . <p> Maybe he just would n't go . Stay in bed and lock the door . Henri could hardly complain to Dr. Sen about him not going on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life miserable with nagging and blustering until he finally gave in . <p> And of course the truth was that Rob did want to go . he really wanted to be the one in the stealth suit , getting within arm 's reach of the Ilmatarans and filming them up close , instead of getting a few murky longdistance drone pictures . Probably everyone else at Hitode Station felt the same way . Putting them here , actually on the sea bottom of Ilmatar , yet forbidding them to get close to the natives , was like telling a pack of horny teenagers they could get naked in bed together , but not touch . <p> He checked his watch . It was 0020. he got up and slung his camera bag over his shoulder . Damn Henri anyway . <p> Rob made it to the dive room without encountering anyone . The station was n't like a space vehicle with round-the-clock shifts . Everyone slept from about 2400 to 0800 , and only one poor soul had to stay in the control room in case of emergency . Tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Henri had managed to square him somehow so that the exterior hydrophones would n't pick up their little jaunt . <p> He took one of the drones off the rack and ran a quick check . It was a flexible robot fish about a meter long , more Navy surplus - American , this time . It was n't especially stealthy , but instead was designed to mimic a mackerel 's sonar signature . Presumably the Ilmatarans would figure it was some native organism and ignore it . His computer linked up with the drone brain by laser . all powered up and ready to go . he told it to hold position and await further instructions , then dropped it into the water . just to be on the safe side , Rob fired up a second drone and tossed it into the moon pool . <p> Next the impellers . They were simple enough - a motor , a battery , and a pair of counter-rotating propellors . You controlled your speed with a thumb switch on the handle . They were supposedly quiet , though in Rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones you could rent at any dive shop back on Earth . Some contractor in Japan had made a bundle on them . Rob found two with full batteries and hooked them on the edge of the pool for easy access . <p> Now for the hard part : suiting up without any help . Rob took off his frayed and slightly smelly insulated jumpsuit and stripped to the skin . First the diaper - he and Henri were going to be out for eight hours , and getting the inside of his suit wet would invite death from hypothermia . Then a set of thick fleece longjohns , like a child 's pajamas . The water outside was well below freezing ; only the pressure and salinity kept it liquid . He 'd need all the insulation he could get . <p> Then the drysuit , double-layered and also insulated . In the chilly air of the changing room he was getting red-faced and hot with all this protection on . The hood was next , a snug fleece balaclava with built-in earphones . Then the helmet , a plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which zipped onto the suit to make a watertight seal . The back of the helmet was packed with electronics - biomonitors , microphones , sonar unit , and an elaborate heads-up display which could project text and data on the inside of the faceplate . There was also a freshwater tube , from which he sipped before going on to the next stage . <p> Panting with the exertion , Rob struggled into the heavy APOS backpack , carefully started it up before attaching the hoses to his helmet , and took a few breaths to make sure it was really working . The APOS gear made the whole Ilmatar expedition possible . It made oxygen out of seawater by electrolysis , supplying it at ambient pressure . Little sensors and a sophisticated computer adjusted the supply to the wearer 's demand . The oxygen mixed with a closed-loop argon supply ; at the colossal pressures of Ilmatar 's ocean bottom , the proper air mix was about 1,000 parts argon to 1 part oxygen . Hitode Station and the subs each had bigger versions , which was how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The price , of course , was that it took six days to go up to the surface . The pressure difference between the 300 atmospheres at the bottom of the sea and the half standard at the surface station meant a human would n't just get the bends if he went up quickly - he 'd literally explode . There were other dangers , too . all the crew at Hitode took a regimen of drugs to ward off the scary side effects of high pressure . <p> With his APOS running ( though for now its little computer was sensible enough to simply feed him air from the room outside ) , Rob pulled on his three layers of gloves , buckled on his fins , put on his weight belt , switched on his shoulder lamp , and then crouched on the edge of the moon pool to let himself tumble backward into the water . It felt pleasantly cool , rather than lethally cold , and he bled a little extra gas into his suit to keep him afloat until Henri could join him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of four meters , and created a little window on his faceplate to let him watch through their eyes . He checked over the camera clamped to his shoulder to make sure it was working . Everything nominal . It was 0120 now . Where was Henri ? <p> Kerlerec lumbered into view ten minutes later . In the bulky stealth suit he looked like a big black toad . The foam cover of his faceplate was hanging down over his chest , and Rob could see that he was red and sweating . Henri waddled to the edge of the pool and fell back into the water with an enormous splash . After a moment he bobbed up next to Rob . <p> " God , it is hot in this thing . You would not believe how hot it is . For once I am glad to be in the water . Do you have everything ? " <p> " Yep . So how are you going to use the camera in that thing ? Wo n't it spoil the whole stealth effect ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to take pictures of me at long range . I have a couple of little cameras inside my helmet . One points forward to see what I see , the other is for my face . Link up . " <p> They got the laser link established and Rob opened two new windows at the bottom of his faceplate . One showed him as Henri saw him - a pale , stubbly face inside a bubble helmet - and the other showed Henri in extreme close-up . The huge green-lit face beaded with sweat looked a bit like the Great and Powerful Oz after a three-day drunk . <p> " Now we will get away from the station and try out your sonar on my suit . You will not be able to detect me at all . " <p> Personally Rob doubted it . Some Russian had made a cool couple of million Euros selling Henri and his sponsors at ScienceMonde a failed prototype or just a fake . <p> The two of them descended until they were underneath Hab One , only a couple of meters above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a pale cone in the silty water , with solid blackness beyond . <p> Henri led the way away from the station , swimming with his headlamp and his safety strobe on until they were a few hundred meters out . " This is good , " he said . " Start recording . " <p> Rob got the camera locked in on Henri 's image . " You 're on . " <p> Henri 's voice instantly became the calm , friendly but all-knowing voice of Henri Kerlerec , scientific media star . " I am here in the dark ocean of Ilmatar , preparing to test the high-tech stealth diving suit which will enable me to get close to the Ilmatarans without being detected . I am covering up the faceplate with the special stealth coating now . My cameraman will try to locate me by sonar . Because the Ilmatarans live in a completely dark environment , they are entirely blind to visible light , so I will leave my safety strobe and headlamp on . " <p> Rob opened up a window to display sonar images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could build up a vague image of the surroundings just from ambient noise and interference patterns . No sign of Henri , even though Rob could see his bobbing headlamp as he swam back and forth ten meters away . <p> Not bad , Rob had to admit . Those Russians know a few things about sonar baffling . He tried the active sonar . The seabottom and the rocks flickered into clear relief , an eerie false-color landscape where green meant soft and yellow meant hard surfaces . The ocean itself was completely black on active . Henri was a green-black shadow against a black background . Even with the computer synthesizing both the active and passive signals , he was almost impossible to see . <p> " Wonderful ! " said Henri when Rob sent him the images . " I told you : completely invisible ! We will edit this part down , of course - just the sonar images with me explaining it in voiceover . Now come along . We have a long trip ahead of us . " <p> THE BITTERWATER COMPANY are waking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , listening carefully at the entrance to each guest chamber and informing the ones already awake that a meal is ready in the main hall . <p> Broadtail savors the elegance of having someone to come wake him when the food is ready . At his own house , all would starve if he waited for his apprentices to prepare the meals . He wonders briefly how they are getting along without him . The three of them are reasonably competent , and can certainly tend his pipes and crops without him . Broadtail does worry about how well they can handle an emergency - what if a pipe breaks or one of his nets is snagged ? He imagines returning home to find chaos and ruin . <p> But it is so very nice here at Longpincer 's house . Mansion , really . The Bitterwater vent is n't nearly as large as Continuous Abundance or the other town vents , but Longpincer controls the entire flow . Everything for ten cables in any direction belongs to him . He has a staff of servants and hired workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Broadtail does n't want to miss the meal . Longpincer 's larder is as opulent as everything else at Bitterwater . As he crawls to the main hall he marvels again at the thick growths on the walls and floor . Some of his own farm pipes do n't support this much life . Is it just that Longpincer 's large household generates enough waste to support lush indoor growth ? Or is he rich enough to pipe some excess vent water through the house itself ? Either way it 's far more than Broadtail 's chilly property and tepid flow rights can achieve . <p> As he approaches the main hall Broadtail can taste a tremendous and varied feast laid out . It sounds as if half a dozen of the Company are already there ; it says much for Longpincer 's kitchen that the only sounds Broadtail can hear are those of eating . <p> He finds a place between Smoothshell and a quiet individual whose name Broadtail ca n't recall . He runs his feelers over the food before him and feels more admiration mixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whole towfin eggs , fresh jellyfronds , and some little bottom-crawling creatures Broadtail is n't familiar with , neatly impaled on thorns and still wiggling . <p> Broadtail ca n't recall having a feast like this since he inherited the Northslope property and gave the funeral banquet for old Flatbody . He is just reaching for a third jellyfrond when Longpincer clicks loudly for attention from the end of the hall . <p> " I suggest a small excursion for the Company , " he says . " About ten cables beyond my boundary stones upcurrent is a small vent , too tepid and bitter to be worth piping . I forbid my workers to drag nets there , and I recall finding several interesting creatures feeding at the vent . I propose swimming there to look for specimens . " <p> " May I suggest applying Sharpfrill 's technique for temperature measurement to those waters ? " says Smoothshell . <p> " Excellent idea ! " cries Longpincer . Sharpfrill mutters something about not having his proper equipment , but the others bring him around . They all finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pouches , and grabs the last towfin egg to fill his own ) , and set out for the edge of Longpincer 's property . <p> Swimming is quicker than walking , so the party of scholars cruise at just above net height . At that height Broadtail can only get a general impression of the land below , but it all seems neat and orderly - a well-planned network of stone pipes radiating out from the main vent , carrying the hot , nutrient-rich water to nourish thousands of plants and bacteria colonies . Leaks from the pipes and the waste from the crops and Longpincer 's household feeds clouds of tiny swimmers , which in turn attract larger creatures from the cold waters around . Broadtail notes with approval the placement of Longpincer 's nets , in staggered rows along the prevailing current . With a little envy he estimates that Longpincer 's nets probably produce as much wealth as his own entire property . <p> Beyond the boundary stones the scholars instinctively gather into a more compact group . There is less conversation and more careful listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandits or scavengers around his vent , but even he pings behind them once or twice , just to make sure . But all anyone can hear are a few wild children , who flee quickly at the approach of adults . <p> HENRI AND RON did n't talk much on the way to the vent community . Both of them were paying close attention to the navigation displays inside their helmets . Getting around on Ilmatar was deceptively easy : take a bearing by inertial compass , point the impeller in the right direction , and off you go . But occasionally Ron found himself thinking about just how hard it would be to navigate without electronic help . The stars were hidden by a kilometer of ice overhead , and Ilmatar had no magnetic field worth speaking of . It was barely possible to tell up from down - if you had your searchlights on and could see the bottom and were n't enveloped in a cloud of silt - but maintaining a constant depth depended entirely on watching the sonar display and the pressure gauge . A human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and completely lost . <p> At 0500 they were nearing the site . " Passive sonar only , " said Henri . " And we must be as quiet as possible . Can you film from a hundred meters away ? " <p> " It 'll need enhancement and cleaning up afterward , but yes . " <p> " Good . You take up a position there - " Henri gestured vaguely into the darkness . <p> " Where ? " <p> " That big clump of rocks at , let me see , bearing one hundred degrees , about fifty meters out . " <p> " Okay . " <p> " Stay there and do not make any noise . I will go on ahead toward the vent . Keep one of the drones with me . " <p> " Right . What are you going to do ? " <p> " I will walk right into the settlement . " <p> Shaking his head , Rob found a relatively comfortable spot among the stones . While he waited for the silt to settle , he noticed that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the remains of a structure of some kind . Some of the surfaces were even carved into patterns of lines . He made sure to take pictures of everything . The other xeno people back at Hitode would kill him if he did n't . <p> Henri went marching past in a cloud of silt . The big camera was going to be useless with him churning up the bottom like that , so Rob relied entirely on the drones . One followed Henri about ten meters back , the second was above him looking down . The laser link through the water was a little noisy from suspended particulates , but he did n't need a whole lot of detail . The drone cameras could store everything internally , so Rob was satisfied with just enough sight to steer them . Since he was comfortably seated and could use his hands , he called up a virtual joystick instead of relying on voice commands or the really irritating eye-tracking menu device . <p> " Look at that ! " Henri called suddenly . <p> " What ? Where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight Ilmatarans swimming along in formation , about ten meters up . They were all adults , wearing belts and harnesses stuffed with gear . A couple carried spears . Ever since the first drone pictures of Ilmatarans , they had been described as looking like giant lobsters , but watching them swim overhead , Rob had to disagree . They were more like beluga whales in armor , with their big flukes and blunt heads . Adults ranged from three to four meters long . Each had a dozen limbs folded neatly against the undersides of their shells : walking legs in back , four manipulators in front , and the big praying-mantis pincers on the front pair . They also had raspy feeding tendrils and long sensory feelers under the head . The head itself was a smooth featureless dome , flaring out over the neck like a coal-scuttle helmet - the origin of the Ilmatarans ' scientific name Salletocephalus structor . Henri 's passive microphones picked up the clicks and pops of the Ilmatarans ' sonar , with an occasional loud ping like a harpsichord note . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head . " What do you think they 're doing ? " asked Rob when they had passed . <p> " I am not sure . Perhaps a hunting party . I will follow them . " <p> Rob wanted to argue , but knew it was pointless . " Do n't go too far . " <p> Henri kicked up from the bottom and began to follow the Ilmatarans . It was hard for a human to keep up with them , even when wearing fins . Henri was sweaty and breathing hard after just a couple of minutes , but he struggled along . " They are stopping , " he said after ten minutes , sounding relieved . <p> The Ilmatarans were dropping down to a small vent formation , which Rob 's computer identified as Maury 3b . Through the drone cameras Rob watched as Henri crept closer to the Ilmatarans . At first he moved with clumsy stealth , then he abandoned all pretense and simply waded in among them . Rob waited for a reaction , but the Ilmatarans seemed intent on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big chunk of old shells welded together by ventwater minerals and mud , just five armspans away across-current . But now it 's gone . Is his memory faulty ? He pings again . There it is , just where it should be . Odd . He goes back to gathering shells . <p> " - you hear me ? Broadtail ! " It is Longpincer . He appears out of nowhere just in front of Broadtail , sounding alarmed . <p> " I 'm here . What 's wrong ? " <p> " Nothing , " says Longpincer . " My own mistake . " <p> " Wait . Tell me . " <p> " It 's very odd . I remember hearing you clattering over the rocks , then silence . I recall pinging and sensing nothing . " <p> " I remember a similar experience - a rock seeming to disappear and then appear again . " <p> Smoothshell comes up . " What 's the problem ? " After they explain she asks , " Could there be a reflective layer here ? Cold water meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel any change in the water temperature , " says Longpincer . " The current here is strong enough to keep everything mixed . " <p> " Let 's listen , " says Broadtail . The three of them stand silently , tails together , heads outward . Broadtail relaxes , letting the sounds and interference patterns of his surroundings create a model in his mind . The vent is there , rumbling and hissing . Someone is scrabbling up the side-probably Sharpfrill with his jars of temperature-sensitive plants . Roundhead and the quiet person are talking together half a cable away , or rather Roundhead is talking and his companion is making occasional polite clicks . Two others are swishing nets through the water upcurrent . <p> But there is something else . Something moving nearby . He ca n't quite hear it , but it blocks other sounds and changes the interference patterns . He reaches over to Smoothshell and taps on her leg . " There is a strange effect in the water in front of me , moving slowly from left to right . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message on Longpincer 's shell . " I think I hear what you mean , " she says . " It 's like a big lump of very soft mud , or pumice stone . " <p> " Yes , " Broadtail agrees . " Except that it 's moving . I 'm going to ping it now . " He tenses his resonator muscle and pings as hard as he can , loud enough to stun a few small swimmers near his head . All the other Company members about the vent stop what they are doing . <p> He hears the entire landscape in front of him - quiet mud , sharp echoes from rocks , muffled and chaotic patterns from patches of plants . And right in the center , only a few armspans in front of him , is a hole in the water . It 's big , whatever it is : almost the size of a young adult , standing upright like a boundary marker . <p> Henri was completely gonzo . He was rattling off narration for the audience completely off the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media star voice and give way to an outburst of pure cackling glee . Rob was pretty excited , too , watching through the cameras as Henri got within arm 's reach of the Ilmatarans . <p> " Here we see a group of Ilmatarans gathering food around one of the seabottom vents . Some are using hand-made nets to catch fish , while these three close to me appear to be scraping algae off the rocks . " <p> " Henri , you 're using Earth life names again . Those are n't fish , or algae either . " <p> " Never mind that now . I will dub in the proper words later if I must . The audience will understand better if I use words they understand . This is wonderful , do n't you think ? I can pat them on the backs if I want to ! " <p> " Remember , no contact . " <p> " Yes , yes . " Back into his narratorvoice . " The exact nature of Ilmataran social organization is still not well understood . We know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing the work of food production , craft work , and defense . The harvest these bring back to their community will be divided among all . " <p> " Henri , you ca n't just make stuff up like that . Some of the audience are going to want links to more info about Ilmataran society . We do n't know how they allocate resources . " <p> " Then there is nothing to say that this is untrue . Robert , people do not want to hear that aliens are just like us . They want wise angels and noble savages . Besides , I am certain I am right . The Ilmatarans behave exactly like early human societies . Remember I am an archaeologist by training . I recognize the signs . " He shifted back into media mode . " Life is difficult in these icy seas . The Ilmatarans must make use of every available source of food to ward off starvation . I am going to get closer to these individuals so that we can watch them at their work . " <p> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell you or something . " <p> " I am being careful . How is the picture quality ? " <p> " Well , the water 's pretty cloudy . I 've got the drone providing an overhead view of you , but the helmet camera 's the only thing giving us any detail . " <p> " I will bend down to get a better view , then . How is that ? " <p> " Better . This is great stuff . " Rob checked the drone image . " Uh , Henri , why are they all facing toward you ? " <p> " We must capture it , " says Longpincer . " I do n't remember reading about anything like this . " <p> " How to capture something we can barely make out ? " asks Broadtail . <p> " Surround it , " suggests Smoothshell . She calls to the others . " Here , quickly ! Form a circle ! " <p> With a lot of clicking questions the other members of the Bitterwater Company gather around - except for Sharpfrill , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature indicators on the vent . <p> " Keep pinging steadily , " says Longpincer . " As hard as you can . Who has a net ? " <p> " Here ! " says Raggedclaw . <p> " Good . Can you make it out ? Get the net on it ! " <p> The thing starts to swim upward clumsily , churning up lots of sediment and making a faint but audible swishing noise with its tails . Under Longpincer 's direction the Company form a box around it , like soldiers escorting a convoy . Raggedclaw gets above it with the net . There is a moment of struggling as the thing tries to dodge aside , then the scientists close in around it . <p> It cuts at the net with a sharp claw , and kicks with its limbs . Broadtail feels the claw grate along his shell . Longpincer and Roundhead move in with ropes , and soon the thing 's limbs are pinned . It sinks to the bottom . <p> " I suggest we take it to my laboratory , " says Longpincer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this remarkable creature . " <p> It continues to struggle , but the netting and ropes are strong enough to hold it . Whatever it is , it 's too heavy to carry swimming , so the group must walk along the bottom with their catch while Longpincer swims ahead to fetch servants with a litter to help . They all ping about them constantly , fearful that more of the strange silent creatures are lurking about . <p> " Robert ! In the name of God , help me ! " The laser link was full of static and skips , what with all the interference from nets , Ilmatarans , and sediment . The video image of Henri degenerated into a series of still shots illustrating panic , terror , and desperation . <p> " Do n't worry ! " he called back , although he had no idea what to do . How could he rescue Henri without revealing himself and blowing all the contact protocols to hell ? For that matter , even if he did reveal himself , how could he overcome half a dozen full-grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henri started what sounded like praying in French . Rob muted the audio to give himself a chance to think , and because it did n't seem right to listen in . <p> He tried to list his options . Call for help ? Too far from the station , and it would take an hour or more for a sub to arrive . Go charging in to the rescue ? Rob really did n't want to do that , and not just because it was against the contact regs . On the other hand he did n't like to think of himself as a coward , either . Skip that one and come back to it . <p> Create a distraction ? That might work . He could fire up the hydrophone and make a lot of noise , maybe use the drones as decoys . The Ilmatarans might drop Henri to go investigate , or run away in terror . Worth a shot , anyway . <p> He sent the two drones in at top speed , and searched through his computer 's sound library for something suitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yells ? " O Fortuna " ? No time to be clever ; he selected the first item in the playlist and started blasting Billie Holiday as loud as the drone speakers could go . Rob left his camera gear with Henri 's impeller , and used his own to get a little closer to the group of Ilmatarans carrying Henri . <p> BROADTAIL HEARS the weird sounds first , and alerts the others . The noise is coming from a pair of swimming creatures he does n't recognize , approaching fast from the left . The sounds are unlike anything he remembers - a mix of low tones , whistles , rattles , and buzzes . There is an underlying rhythm , and Broadtail is sure this is some kind of animal call , not just noise . <p> The swimmers swoop past low overhead , then , amazingly , circle around together for another pass , like trained performing animals . " Do those creatures belong to Longpincer ? " Broadtail asks the others . <p> " I do n't think so , " says Smoothshell . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Does anyone have a net ? " <p> " Do n't be greedy , " says Roundhead . " This is a valuable specimen . We should n't risk it to chase after others . " <p> Broadtail starts to object , but he realizes Roundhead is right . This thing is obviously more important . Still - " I suggest we return here to search for them after sleeping . " <p> " Agreed . " <p> The swimmers continue diving at them and making noise until Longpincer 's servants show up to help carry the specimen . <p> Rob had hoped the Ilmatarans would scatter in terror when he sent in the drones , but they barely even noticed them - even with the speaker volume maxed out . He could n't tell if they were too dumb to pay attention , or smart enough to focus on one thing at a time . <p> He gunned the impeller , closing in on the little group . Enough subtlety . He could see the lights on Henri 's suit about fifty meters away , bobbing and wiggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop about ten meters from the Ilmatarans . The two big floodlights on the impeller showed them clearly . <p> Enough subtlety and sneaking around . He turned on his suit hydrophone . " Hey ! " He had his dive knife in his right hand in case of trouble . <p> Broadtail is relieved to be rid of the strange beast . He is getting tired and hungry , and wants nothing more than to be back at Longpincer 's house snacking on threadfin paste and heat-cured eggs . <p> Then he hears a new noise . A whine , accompanied by the burble of turbulent water . Off to the left about three lengths there is some large swimmer . It gives a loud call . The captive creature struggles harder . <p> Broadtail pings the new arrival . It is very odd indeed . It has a hard cylindrical body like a riftcruiser , but at the back it branches out into a bunch of jointed limbs covered with soft skin . The thing gives another cry and waves a couple of limbs . <p> Broadtail moves toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two creatures , maybe ? And what is it doing ? Is this a territorial challenge ? He keeps his own pincers folded so as not to alarm it . <p> " Be careful , Broadtail , " Longpincer calls . <p> " Do n't worry . " He does n't approach any closer , but evidently he 's already too close . The thing cries out one more time , then charges him . Broadtail does n't want the other Bitterwater scholars to see him flee , so he splays his legs and braces himself , ready to grapple with this unknown monster . <p> But just before it hits him , the thing veers off and disappears into the silent distance . Listening carefully lest it return , Broadtail backs toward the rest of the group and they resume their journey to Longpincer 's house . <p> Everyone agrees that this expedition is stranger than anything they remember . Longpincer seems pleased . <p> Rob stopped his impeller and let the drones catch up . He could n't think of anything else to do . The Ilmatarans would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could attack them . Whatever happened to Henri , Rob did not want to be the first human to harm an alien . <p> The link with Henri was still open . The video showed him looking quite calm , almost serene . <p> " Henri ? " he said . " I tried everything I could think of . I ca n't get you out . There are too many of them . " <p> " It is all right , Robert , " said Henri , sounding surprisingly cheerful . " I do not think they will harm me . Otherwise why go to all the trouble to capture me alive ? Listen : I think they have realized I am an intelligent being like themselves . This is our first contact with the Ilmatarans . I will be humanity 's ambassador . " <p> " You think so ? " For once Rob found himself hoping Henri was right . <p> " I am certain of it . Keep the link open . The video will show history being made . " <p> Rob sent in one drone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a large rambling building near the Maury 3a vent . As he disappeared inside , Henri managed a grin for the camera . <p> Longpincer approaches the strange creature , laid out on the floor of his study . The others are all gathered around to help and watch . Broadtail has a fresh reel of cord and is making a record of the proceeding . Longpincer begins . " The hide is thick , but flexible , and is a nearly perfect sound absorber . The loudest of pings barely produce any image at all . There are four limbs . The forward pair appear to be for feeding , while the rear limbs apparently function as both walking legs and what one might call a double tail for swimming . Roundhead , do you know of any such creature recorded elsewhere ? " <p> " I certainly do not recall reading of such a thing . It seems absolutely unique . " <p> " Please note as much , Broadtail . My first incision is along the underside . Cutting the hide releases a great many bubbles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connective tissue at all . I feel what seems to be another layer underneath . The creature 's interior is remarkably warm . " <p> " The poor thing , " says Raggedclaw . " I do hate causing it pain . " <p> " As do we all , I 'm sure , " says Longpincer . " I am cutting through the under-layer . It is extremely tough and fibrous . I hear more bubbles . The warmth is extraordinary - like pipe-water a cable or so from the vent . " <p> " How can it survive such heat ? " asks Roundhead . <p> " Can you taste any blood , Longpincer ? " adds Sharpfrill . <p> " No blood that I can taste . Some odd flavors in the water , but I judge that to be from the tissues and space between . I am peeling back the underlayer now . Amazing ! Yet another layer beneath it . This one has a very different texture - fleshy rather than fibrous . It is very warm . I can feel a trembling sensation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like that before ? " says Smoothshell . " It sounds like no creature I know of . " <p> " I recall that other thing making similar sounds , " says Broadtail . <p> " I now cut through this layer . Ah - now we come to viscera . The blood tastes very odd . Come , everyone , and feel how hot this thing is . And feel this ! Some kind of rigid structures within the flesh . " <p> " It is not moving , " says Roundhead . <p> " Now let us examine the head . Someone help me pull off the shell here . Just pull . Good . Thank you , Raggedclaw . What a lot of bubbles ! I wonder what this structure is ? " <p> The trip back was awful . Rob could n't keep from replaying Henri 's death in his mind . He got back to the station hours late , exhausted and half out of his mind . As a small mercy Rob did n't have to tell anyone what had happened - they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . But because the next supply vehicle was n't due for another twenty months , it all happened in slow motion . Rob knew he 'd be going back to Earth , and guessed that he 'd never make another interstellar trip again . He did n't go out on dives ; instead he took over drone maintenance and general tech work from Sergei , and stayed inside the station . <p> Nobody blamed him , at least not exactly . At the end of his debriefing , Dr. Sen did look at Rob over his little Gandhi glasses and say , " I think it was rather irresponsible of you both to go off like that . But I am sure you know that already . " <p> Sen also deleted the " Death to HK " list from the station 's network , but someone must have saved a copy . The next day it was anonymously relayed to Rob 's computer with a final method added : " Let a group of Ilmatarans catch him and slice him up . " <p> Rob did n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
