On average , American women currently earn 23 cents less on the dollar than men , which over a lifetime can add up to an astonishing loss of $700,000 to $2 million . But there 's something you can do today to start bridging the chasm between women 's and men 's wages . // THE GENDER WAGE GAP IS NOT WOMEN 'S FAULT . It exists because of discrimination . There 's plain old discrimination , which openly bans women from hiring and advancement . There 's discrimination by sexual harassment , which humiliates women and drives them out of jobs . There 's discrimination by sex segregation or by slotting women into job categories that are consistently underpaid . There 's " working while female " - that everyday discrimination by which women are dismissed and paid less than their male peers . And there 's discrimination against mothers , which forces women ( and not men ) to pay for parenting . All this scrapes away women 's earnings , day after day , year after year , throughout our lives . Even if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never close-and the next generation of women will be stuck with that gap as well . So how can you convince your employer-and American employers as a whole-to close the gender wage gap , once and for all ? You must simply take six steps : document , research , collaborate , learn to negotiate , ask for fair pay and celebrate . 1 . Document AS LONG AS THE FULL PICTURE OF WOMEN 'S WALLET discrimination does not exist , employers can and will get by with ignoring this problem . So , every single time you think you 're treated unfairly on the job-even if you 're not 100 percent sure it was discrimination-document it . Just found out that the man who replaced you was hired for much more than you ever made ? Appalled that a man with less experience gets on the payroll while you 're still a consultant ? Furious that the shy woman down the hall quit because her manager would n't stop pawing her ? Angry that certain job categories-or promotion-track projects-are somehow never open to you or your female coworkers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , wherever and whenever you see it . Keep a log with dates , times and facts about each incident and-this is important-calculate what that incident cost you , both at the time and projected into your future . If you absolutely can not stand writing things down , do this step with a partner . Have her interview you and write down your experiences , and then do the same for her . In addition to keeping track for yourself , please send your story to www.wageproject.org WAGE is the Women Are Getting Even Project , a national nonprofit dedicated to closing the wage gap . One of the WAGE Project 's main efforts is building a national database of just how much sex discrimination is costing working women in America . In their book Legalizing Gender Inequality , law professor Robert Nelson and sociologist William Bridges found that the decisions that nick women 's pay may be made by many different people-none of whom intends to hurt women 's earnings . But when women show that all these little nicks are part of an employer 's normal operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how that financial loss has hurt their lives , their lawsuits can win large sums of money . I 'm not suggesting that you should race off to court . But what works in the courtroom will also work in the boss 's office . 2 . Do the research . FIND OUT WHAT MEN WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE , performance record , education or other measures get paid for doing jobs like yours . Research your industry , region and job title . Look at the gender composition of different job titles to see whether female employees are clustered together in a lower-paid " ghetto . " You can use a number of resources for this pursuit . Check commercial websites such as www.salary.com to compare your salary to those of others in your occupation , industry and region . If you get stuck during your research , ask your local librarian for help . As you do this research , guard against two common tendencies : either despairing ( " I 'm afraid to find out how underpaid I am ! " ) or down-grading your own worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your company . You might not be able to get internal salary information at first , so start with what you can measure . Does everyone have the same opportunities for training , or the same budget for industry travel ? How are decisions made about who is allocated new clients , assigned parking spaces or relocation money ? Even if you ca n't find information about others ' salaries today , you might figure out how to do so tomorrow . Many employees find this data , without being either devious or confrontational . Sometimes it 's handed to them accidentally . Sometimes employees know what others make , and see the pay scales every day . Sometimes women ask their male buddies and colleagues . Men often know what their peers earn . It 's their way of keeping score . But even before you have found out about salaries within the company , calculate what the wage gap means for you . Go to the www.wageproject.org and use the wage loss calculator to see for yourself what discrimination is costing you . How much will you be losing-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-because you 're missing two , or five , or fifteen thousand a year ? What 's the cost of not getting that promised raise or promotion ? Once you add up the actual costs to you , the wage gap gets very personal . When that happens , I have no doubt that you will be fortified to press your employer for the pay you deserve . 3 . Collaborate WHEN LONGTIME MIT BIOLOGY PROFESSOR NANCY Hopkins became so fed up that she was being mistreated and not being heard , she decided to write to MIT 's president , carefully detailing how female scientists were being held back . But before she sent that letter , she paused . Worried that she could be too easily brushed off as a crank , she decided to show it to one other female scientist . To Hopkins ' immense relief , her colleague agreed with her conclusions-and wanted to sign on to the letter . Then the two of them wondered whether MIT 's other female scientists agreed . All but one signed on . Hopkins no longer had a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university 's development of a strategy to undo its gender discrimination in the sciences . You must do this as well . Find some other women who work where you do . If they 've already discovered their own wage gap , suggest that you band together . If they have n't , encourage them to do the research . Talking with others in the company brings you information you might not have known you were missing . Just as important , you find allies among both women and men . These are the people who will help you later on . Start these conversations by being open , welcoming and thoughtful , with a constructive approach that wo n't be perceived as undermining your colleagues or the company . Talk about everyone 's shared belief that wages that should be fairly earned , and rationally and equitably distributed . Working together reduces the risk of being ignored as individual troublemakers or ridiculed as malcontents . And include men wherever possible . Not just men who are bosses and chief executives , but also the men who work beside women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who work alongside them get treated and paid fairly , they 'll know their employer intends to treat every employee fairly . And men who see employers paying women what they 're worth can breathe more easily about their sisters ' and daughters ' and nieces ' futures . There are many ways men can help women . They can include women in the informal networks that share information about one another 's bonuses or benefits . They can coach women in negotiating . They can listen seriously when women charge discrimination , and dive into investigating , documenting and ending it-without the kind of defensiveness that forces a lawsuit . They can help create a corporate climate that refuses to harbor excuses for discrimination . 4 . Learn to negotiate . THE NEXT STEP IS ONE THAT MANY WOMEN DREAD : asking for more money . One female economist , when she heard my prescription , asked skeptically , " Are you suggesting women put their jobs on the line just to get paid a little more ? Women wo n't take that risk . " So let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your own , angrily , full of outrage , charging into the boss 's office and sounding unreasonable . But if you do n't ask , you wo n't get paid what you deserve . Remember what you found out from your research : You probably found a difference between what you are paid and what 's being paid to a man doing similar work , with similar experience and responsibilities . And if you did , you found out why there 's a difference in pay : because he was promoted while you are still waiting ; or because the company gave him more resources to bring in business ; or because your boss thought you could n't handle any more work because you have family responsibilities . Whatever the excuse , the real reason is that you 're a woman . That gap is due to discrimination . It is both unfair and illegal . Prepared with your documentation and with your research , you 're almost ready to negotiate with your boss . Do n't flinch at the word " negotiate . " It does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " negotiate " is quite moderate : " To confer ( or , exchange views ) with another so as to arrive at a settlement of some matter . " You 're going to confer with your boss about facts and information that reveal your paycheck to be unfair . You 're not accusing anyone of being evil ; you 're laying out the objective facts as you see them . But do n't leap into the conversation with the boss too soon . First , learn the skills of persuasion and negotiation . Like everything else about your job , persuasion and negotiation are learned skills . There 's no such thing as a " born negotiator " or a " natural persuader . " How can you learn ? Go to the bookstore or library and look through relevant books until you find a few that speak to you . Ask friends or family members what tips they might have for you . There 's no correct blanket recommendation ; you 'll have to find a guide whose style suits you personally . Be sure that this step is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a much better job if you 've spent some time practicing together and critiquing each other . Too many women think that if they work hard enough to earn a raise or promotion they 'll be treated fairly and that raise will automatically show up in their paycheck . But no employer willingly pays workers any more money than they have to . You have to both earn it-and ask for it . If you 're reluctant to ask for more money , it 's not your fault . You 've been pressured not to ask . Gender stereotypes are n't just outside of us , prompting men to undervalue women ; they 're also inside us , prompting women to feel that it 's not " right " to ask for money for themselves . Just as it feels " natural " to men to automatically think of another man for the job , so it feels " natural " to women to wait until someone thinks to reward them for their good work . // But it is your responsibility to buck those pressures-and to stand up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to override their internal stereotypes , it 's only fair that we must also override our own . If you do n't do it , you 're reinforcing the guys ' ingrained beliefs that they can take advantage of women-and they 'll treat the next woman ( and the next generation of women ) the same old way . You do n't have to confront your boss . You do n't have to become so nasty that you would n't invite yourself over for dinner . It 's better to ask in a style that 's comfortable and that fits your personality . In fact , there 's growing evidence that that 's much more effective . For instance , negotiations coach Lee Miller , who cowrote A Woman 's Guide to Successful Negotiating with his daughter Jessica Miller , suggests trying to convince , collaborate , create-hardly a combative , testosterone-driven style . 5 . Talk to the boss . MANY WOMEN WILL BEGIN THIS STEP BY HAVING individual conversations with their own managers . This might come as part of an annual review , or while discussing a possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known as unfair . Demanding , yes . Hard-driving , sure . But unfair ? Nope . Especially when they know that beneath the label " unfair " may hide the word " illegal . " You never have to use that word . When you present the facts in a reasonable way , you will have conveyed your message . Of course , your manager may not be willing or able to get you even or fix unfair organizational practices . What now ? Here 's where your allies are absolutely essential . You do n't want to go any further alone ; that might put your job at risk . So here 's the next step : As a group , meet with the CEO , the top dog . Tell your stories and let your CEO , know that these stories may signal a larger , systematic pattern of wage discrimination throughout the company . Ask the CEO to do a gender wage analysis , and if that study shows a pattern of underpaying women employees , press the CEO to eliminate the wage gap by raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of bad publicity and costly litigation . When you make a sustained , solid case about your unfair pay to the boss , he 'll be hard-pressed not to make amends . Sure , you may run into a scone wall with the CEO . But armed with the facts and your new sensibility , you and your allies still have other options . You might get the attention of board members or the business 's owners-using whatever method seems the most sensible course , given your group 's situation-and ask that they hold the CEO accountable . 6 . Celebrate ! EVERY TIME YOU OR ONE OF YOUR FEmale friends or colleagues gets a raise , a promotion , more benefits or some unforeseen extra , take time to salute her accomplishment . Wiping out the wage gap will require many small efforts-and a lot of stamina . So let 's celebrate every time we move forward even a notch . When it 's appropriate , boast about your organization 's successes to the media . That will push your company to do more-and put pressure on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hopelessness is solitary ; success is infectious . Here 's what will happen when large numbers of working women collaborate with each other in standing up for equity : Their employers are going to feel pressure . When employers see that the women who work for them are informed about what they 're due and are making the cases for their own pay , employers will feel heat to reexamine their entire operations . Individual women will realize that what they are asking for is simply fairness for themselves and all other working women . They will see that they are not alone . Other women will catch the spirit-and women will act en masse to get even . Sidebar <p>
