Exemplars of Headnote biological control , Cactoblastis larvae have long lived up to their name by Headnote devouring unwanted prickly pear cacti . Lately the caterpillars are revealing a taste for rarer succulents. // When the first ships carrying British convicts landed on the site that is now Sydney , Australia , in 1788 , the human passengers were not the only newcomers on board . A type of prickly pear , Opuntia monacantha , also made the voyage . Collected in Rio de Janeiro , the cactusor , more precisely , the cochineal insects that feed on it and yield a red-purple stain when crushed-were to be the basis of a dye industry . The dye enterprise never took off , but the prickly pear did . In addition to O , monacantha , other imported cactus species ( in particular , O. stricta and O. inermis ) spread relentlessly on open land that ranchers were eager to use for raising other introduced species : cattle and sheep . In 1925 , at the height of the problem , 94,000 square miles in Queensland and New South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australians had reacted to the situation by establishing the Commonwealth Prickly Pear Board . When the cacti were originally imported , care had been taken to ensure that no insects except cochineals accompanied the plants . The board 's first step was to send entomologists to the United States , Mexico , and Argentina to find other insects that naturally fed on Opuntia and that could be shipped to Australia and released in the hope that they could destroy the pest cacti . The Prickly Pear Board , in reuniting insects with their host plants , was using biological control . Biologists were already beginning to see the practice as a worthy form of pest control . In the late 1880s , for example , predaceous ladybird beetles imported from Australia had decimated the cottony-cushion scale insect that was consuming citrus crops in California .

Shipped from Argentina , a cargo of 2,750 eggs landed in Brisbane as half-grown larvae . These were the only Cactoblastis ever brought to Australia , but they were enough . The arrivals were used as breeding stock , and by March 1927 more than 10 million eggs had been placed on cactus plants in the field . The female Cactoblastis moth lays eggs in a chain , or egg stick , that usually dangles from the tip of a cactus spine . Egg sticks contain fifty to eighty eggs , and each female lays three or four of them in its adult life span of about nine days . The gregarious larvae bore into a cactus pad , feed on the inner flesh , and then move on to a new pad after the destruction of the old . The larvae from an average egg stick need about four pads of Opuntia stricta to sustain them . Under favorable conditions , as many as three generations of Cactoblastis may mature each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast tracts of eastern Australia had been cleared of dense prickly pear . Australia 's experience with Cactoblastis is probably the world 's most famous case of one introduced species being controlled by another . Biological control has continued to gain in popularity . Since the 1980s , it has been promoted as environmentally sound and a healthy alternative to chemical control , because unlike pesticides , the agents do not pollute soil or water . So , compared with the use of pesticides , does the technique present any serious problems ? What prevents a biological agent brought into an environment for a specific purpose from going out of bounds ? Most of these agents are carefully screened before introduction to ensure that they will feed only on the targeted pest species . Yet just as medicines can have side effects , biological controls have occasionally produced what are called nontarget effects . Recognition of this potential for unintended results is leading to a contentious debate between advocates of biological control and some conservationists . My own interest in the debate stems from my experience with the very species that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1957 , when Cactoblastis was brought to the Caribbean island of Nevis , in the Lesser Antilles , to control Opuntia there . Whether biological-control users overstepped their mark in the Caribbean case is difficult to judge . This genus of cactus is native to the Caribbean and the United States , although Cactoblastis is not . But the plant covered land that was seen as potentially profitable . As in Australia , Cactoblastis did clear out the cactus , and the land was freed up for grazing . In the wake of that success , the moth was also introduced to other islands , such as Montserrat and Antigua . The problem was that the moths began to disperse on their own . In 1989 William Starmer , a Syracuse University professor of biology studying cactus yeasts in Cuba , found Cactoblastis there by chance . Starmer alerted botanists at the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Florida to the possibility that the species would soon arrive in the Florida Keys , just ninety miles from Cuba . Sure enough , that same year , researchers on the lookout for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keys . The moth could have taken two possible routes to Florida . Records indicate that in the mid-1980s , infected pads of ornamental cacti from the Dominican Republic had been intercepted in the port of Miami . But the fact that Cactoblastis appeared first in the Keys , without apparent help , suggests natural dispersal . Most likely , the moths simply islandhopped from Cuba . Once in Florida , the larvae began to devour the prickly pear , which is not considered a problem there , and then went on to attack other Opuntia species . Of greatest concern was the semaphore cactus , O. spinosissima . Only twelve individual plants of this species were known . Fortunately these few plants grew on land owned by The Nature Conservancy A student of mine , Derek Johnson , had shown the semaphore cactus to be a preferred Cactoblastis host , so land stewards quickly erected screen cages around the plants to protect them from the egg-laying moths . But this was only a short-term solution . Because the cages kept out all insects , they prevented cactus pollination and fruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to be dismantled before they broke apart and blew away , taking parts of the cacti with them . To preserve the semaphore cactus population , pads were taken from the base of parent plants and grown in a greenhouse until they were big enough to plant in the wild . From May 1996 to September 1998 , I worked with students and Nature Conservancy staff to plant 276 pads . We found that these pads , if placed too close to prickly pears infected by Cactoblastis , would soon be discovered by the moths and eaten by caterpillars . Small cages placed around the young plants provided little protection ; roaming animals , possibly Key deer ( also an endangered species ) , rubbed against and knocked down the cages and trampled the cacti . Our efforts to restore the semaphore cactus had been hampered by the unintended spread of the moth beyond Nevis and by the larvae 's newly evident taste for a variety of Opuntia . Many people may find the loss of a relatively obscure cactus a small price to pay for the commercial benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sites worldwide of rampant prickly pears . To others , the adverse effects of the moth in Florida are just the tip of a looming , nontarget iceberg . Since arriving in Florida sometime before 1989 , the moth has spread . By 1992 it had reached the Tampa Bay area , and in 1999 , Sapelo Island , Georgia . If the moth can survive this far north , what is to stop its spread across the Gulf states and into the Opuntiarich deserts of the southwestern United States , where cacti are an essential and much-appreciated characteristic of the landscape ? And what about Mexico , where eighty species of Opuntia support a cochineal dye industry and are the source of edible prickly pear fruit ? The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 's records list one border interception ( at Laredo , Texas ) for Cactoblastis coming out of Mexico , so the moth may already be there . Photograph Rare but edible : Semaphore cacti // To stop Cactoblastis , some entomologists have suggested further biological control and are in favor of looking for and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larvae . Parasitic wasps inject their eggs into the bodies of caterpillars . After hatching , the wasp young devour the larvae from the inside out . But after being released in Florida , such a wasp could take off on its own nontarget trajectory , parasitizing not only Cactoblastis but also native species of Opuntia-feeding caterpillars . Given the popularity of biological control as an alternative to pesticides and given the care taken to match natural enemies , just how common are nontarget effects ? The discovery of Cactoblastis in Cuba was serendipitous , and only when botanists were put on alert was its presence in the Keys confirmed . Lately some university researchers have been looking for and uncovering other examples of nontarget effects . Svata Louda , of the University of Nebraska , discovered that a weevil introduced to control nonnative thistles on midwestern range land is also attacking native thistles . In South Dakota , an exotic ladybird beetle brought in to prey on aphids has had the unfortunate effect of lowering the abundance of native ladybird species . A crayfish and a mosquito fish imported into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also feed on a rare newt and may be responsible for local extinctions of this amphibian . In the Northeast , a single species of parasitic fly has caused declines in the populations of two native silk moth species . Researchers at the University of California , Irvine , claim that at least 50 of the 313 parasites released against pests in the United States attack other species as well . And these are just direct effects . On San Salvador Island in the Bahamas , prickly pear cactus is a major food of rock iguanas . But because the plants are also under heavy attack by Cactoblastis , fears are growing that the iguana population will be severely , although indirectly , hurt by the activities of Cactoblastis larvae . In Montana , gall flies released to limit knapweed turn out to provide a food bonanza for white-footed mice . While the mice benefit from the nontarget effect , their proliferation has the potential to change the structure of the small-mammal community and can also produce a ripple effect if , for example , more mice lead to an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls themselves be better controlled ? Diligent testing of possible nontarget effects prior to an organism 's release can help , as can more widespread recognition of the problem . In the United States , the Invasive Species Council , established in February 1999 and composed of representatives from federal agencies , has taken on the task of developing a management plan for invasive species-those that have entered new areas on their own , often driving down numbers of native plants and animals . Think of zebra mussels in the Great Lakes and Asian long-horned beetles in New York City . Perhaps some of the federal money allocated to the council could be used to study deliberately released exotic species , which do not fall under the invasive category . At an October 1999 meeting in Montpellier , France , biological-control practitioners presented-and , for the first time in twenty years , openly discussed-the problem of nontarget effects . I am not advocating that we simply stop biological control . But we do need to weigh all forms of pest control against one another and against the cost of doing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species as well as the damage done by pests . " Water and words , " says a Chinese proverb , " easy to pour , impossible to recover . " Similarly , once these tiny organisms are slipped into the environment , we can never take them back .
