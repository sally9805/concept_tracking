/Jan 2000 A wailing smoke alarm awakened the Dobben family to the terrifying sight of their century-old Arthur , Ontario farmhouse on fire . Thick smoke and flames made it impossible to go downstairs . So 14-year-old Cynthia made her way out through a second-floor balcony , then climbed down a tree and got a ladder for mom , dad and 12-year-old Teri . " It was wonderful that there was no panic , " says Wanda Dobben . " We were n't running in different directions . " The family 's cool-headedness came from experience  --  not with fires , but with a practised escape plan . " The escape plan is really important , " says Stephen Welowszky , public education officer with Toronto Fire services . Welowszky suggests drawing a floor plan of your home , showing all the possible exits from each room . Then make sure everyone knows that if they hear the smoke alarm , they should leave the house immediately and not go back inside . You should also have a prearranged meeting place outside in case family members use different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building to look for someone who has already escaped . Minutes can mean the difference between life and death in a fire . So it 's vital that your family knows how to get out of your home quickly and safely . Once you 've made your plan , your family should practise it twice a year , according to Toronto Fire services . These dry runs help you discover problem areas . For example , you may have counted on climbing through a certain window , only to find it 's been painted shut . The drills also get family members acquainted with the escape plan . And that knowledge , say the experts , reduces panic in a real emergency . The threat of panic is especially worrisome if you live in a high-rise apartment , where hundreds of people might be trying to get out at once . " High-rises , on the whole , are very safe , " says Welowszky . They 're equipped with alarms , sprinklers and a public address system . Take the time to read notices that outline the building 's escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your front door is cool to the touch and there 's no smoke in the hall , exit via the stairs . And close your door behind you . Never use the elevator , because you could become trapped . If you are forced to stay in your apartment , block the gap under the front door with wet towels to prevent smoke from entering . Phone the fire department and tell them your apartment number . Then move to the most protected room in your apartment , furthest from the fire , and wait to be rescued . Keep in mind that you may be able to see the firefighters from your window or balcony , but they might not see you . And as Welowszky explains : " If we have to do an internal rescue , we re first going to the units where people are . " Sometimes a window might be your only means of escape . But Welland , Ontario firefighter Mike Carrey is surprised at how often he 's had to reassure kids that it 's OK to smash a window if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . Many children fear their parents would be upset by a broken window . He recommends that kids use something solid , like a chair , to break the window so they do n't cut their hands . Carrey travels with the Fire Safety House , a trailer outfitted with a small kitchen and bedroom . The trailer stops at schools and community events as part of a travelling fire education program . On one recent visit , Carrey was instructing group of Toronto kindergarten students . He used the trailer to stimulate an actual fire . As the alarm wailed and theatrical " smoke " billowed from the window , Carrey urged the kids to crawl on the floor . Then they were told to touch the bedroom door with the back of their hand to prevent their palms and fingers from burning . The drill ended with the children climbing out the window , and down a ladder to safety . The kids going through the Fire Safety House on that day were four and five  --  old enough to understand the basic principles of fire safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fire , five-year-old Nigel Champion immediately piped up with the correct answer : " Stop , drop and roll . " According to Welowszky , children as young as three can understand that " a smoke alarm equals bad smoke and to get out . " It 's also important to teach kids what to do if they 're trapped in a room . " Stay by the window . With kids I stress , " Do n't go in the closet and do n't go under the bed because a firefighter ca n't see you . ' ' " Fire prevention is just as important as planning an emergency escape . One study asked people where they feel the safest from fire , and most said in their home . But that 's where seven out of ten fires occur . " The number one cause of fires in the home is careless cooking . Always have a pot or pan lid beside whatever you 're cooking , " says Welowszky . The lid can be put on the pan to smother flames . And do n't dash to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great a risk of dropping it , causing the fire to spread . Keep tea towels , curtains , paper towels and other flammable materials away from the stove . And tie back loose sleeves when you 're working around the burners . If there 's a fire in your microwave oven , do n't open the door . Instead , turn the microwave off and , if possible , unplug it . If you have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen , read the instructions so you know how to use it and for which type of fire , such as grease or electrical . A real fire is not the time to be fumbling around with unfamiliar equipment . Careless cooking is responsible for most house fires , but careless smoking is the number one cause of fatal fires . If you allow smoking in your home , put out large , deep ashtrays and pour water on the cigarette butts before you throw them in the garbage . It 's also a good idea to check sofas and chairs after a party because a cigarette can smoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , keep lighters and matches away from children . You can reduce the risk of an electrical fire by replacing cords and plugs that show signs of wear . And take care with heat sources . If you use a space heater , for instance , place it at least one metre from anything that can burn , like drapes and furniture . If you use the fireplace , install a close-fitting metal fire screen or heat-tempered glass doors to prevent sparks and embers from flying out . After you 've gone through the upper floors , do n't forget the basement . Try to keep such storage areas free of clutter , and store flammable materials away from the furnace . If the pilot light on your gas furnace or water heater goes out , get a qualified service person to relight it . Also make sure to keep any work areas clear of scraps , wood and sawdust . We all hope that our planning and prevention will never be put to the test , but it 's best to think ahead because a fire can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose everything , " sighs Wanda Dobben . The family may have lost their home and many of their possessions . But thanks to careful preparation , they escaped with their lives .

" Generally , it 's smoke inhalation that 's going to kill , " warns Stephen Welowszky , public education officer with Toronto Fire services .

It 's easy to forget to change the batteries , or be tempted to disconnect one because it goes off when you 're cooking . If you 're guilty of ignoring or tampering with your alarm , think about this : In a survey conducted in Alberta , 58 percent of houses that had fires also had smoke alarms . But in more than one-third of these homes , the device was n't working . Here are some other smoke signals to keep in mind : - Fire prevention experts recommend having an alarm on every level of your home , especially outside sleeping areas . And Alberta fire commissioner Tom Makey advises setting them at least 16 cm ( 6 1/2 in. ) from a corner for maximum efficiency . " Smoke does n't travel well into corners , " says Makey . He also recommends checking the alarm at least once a month , and changing the battery in the fall when you turn the clocks back . - If your smoke alarm goes off a lot , it may be too close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or the alarm may be defective . You could also try cleaning the unit with a vacuum because dust particles can set off a false alarm . - Test your alarm according to the manufacturer 's instructions .

Hot Tips North American children are killed or seriously hurt in fires twice as often as adults .
