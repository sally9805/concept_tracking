A room still called the nursery . One of the doors leads to Anya 's room . The sun is about to rise . It 's already May . The cherry orchard is in bloom , but it 's cold in the orchard ; a morning frost . The windows in the room are closed . Dunyasha enters with a candie ; Lopakhin with a book in his hand . LOPAKHIN The train finally arrived . Thank God . What time is it ? DUNYASHA Almost two . ( She blows out the candle . ) It 's already getting light . LOPAKHIN The train was two hours late . ( He yawns and stretches . ) That was stupid . I came over especially to meet them at the station and I slept right through I was sitting right here and I fell asleep . You should have woken me up . DUNYASHA I thought you 'd left . ( She listens . ) Listen  --  are they already here ? LOPAKHIN ( He listens . ) No . They have baggage to collect . DUNYASHA Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's changed . She was always such a good person . Very kind . Very gentle . I remember one time when I was a kid , about fifteen or so , they had my old man working in a store for them down in the village  --  and he hauled off and hit me  --  with his fist  --  right in the face  --  and my nose bled . He 'd been drinking . And we had to come up here for some reason and Lyubov Andreyevna  --  she was still young and so slim  --  she took me in , right into this room , and washed the blood off my face . " Do n't cry , " she said . " Do n't cry , poor thing , it 'll heal before you 're married . " ( Pause . ) " Poor thing " Well , we were poor , but look at me now  --  all dressed up , new suit , imported boots . I 'm rich .

DUNYASHA Yes , sir . ( She goes out . ) YEPIKHODOV Morning frost  --  three degrees  --  and the cherries are all in bloom . I ca n't approve of our climate . ( Sighs . ) I simply ca n't . Our climate does n't work . And permit me to add , I bought myself a pair of boots the day before yesterday  --  and I dare assure you they squeak  --  listen , they squeak so loud I can barely hear it ! Do you have any idea what I can put on them ? What kind of oil  --  p. 4 LOPAKHIN Will you be quiet ? YEPIKHODOV Every day something terrible happens to me . Like a curse . But I do n't complain . I 've gotten used to it . I even smile . ( Enter Dunyasha . She brings Lopakhin a beer . ) I 'm going . ( He stumbles over a chair . It falls . ) See ? ( Triumphant . ) You see what I mean ?

DUNYASHA I do n't know what to do about it I mean , he 's kind of nice but when he starts to talk you ca n't understand him . I mean , it sounds all right , but it does n't make a whole lot of sense . I mean , I do like him . Sort of . And he 's crazy about me . But he 's not exactly what you call lucky . Every day there 's something else . We all call him : The Walking Disaster . LOPAKHIN ( Listens . ) It sounds like they 're here DUNYASHA ( Overlap the last word . ) They 're here ! What 's the matter with me ? I 'm trembling ! LOPAKHIN They 're really here . Let 's go meet them . You think she 'll recognize me ?

ANYA When we got to Paris it was cold and snowing there , too . And my French is really terrible . Mama lives in this fifth-floor apartment . We had to walk up . When we got there , it was full of French people . Some old priest was reading an old book , and everybody was smoking these terrible-smelling cigarettes  --  I felt so sorry for Mama I just hugged her so hard ; I could n't let go .

LOPAKHIN Your brother tells people I 'm a boor because I come from nothin , but I do n't care . He can say what he wants . I just hope that you 'll believe in me the way you used to , that your tender , wonderful eyes will gaze at me the way they used to . My God , my father slaved for your father and your father 's father , but you have done so much for me that I forget all that . I love you .

LOPAKHIN Well , I would like to give you some good news : something cheerful , something pleasant . There 's no time to talk now , I 'm afraid . I 've got to go soon , so I 'll be brief . As you know , your estate is to be sold at auction to pay off your debts . The date arranged for sale is August twenty-second . Now do n't be upset , dear lady . I 've found you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my plan : your estate is only thirteen miles from town and a short drive to the train station . All you have to do is clear the cherry orchard and the land by the river and subdivide . Lease the small lots for vacation homes , and you 'll have a return of twenty-five thousand a year , minimum . p. 15 GAYEV What an outrageous thing to say ! LYUBOV Excuse me I do n't think I understand LOPAKHIN You can lease each lot for at least twenty-five rubles a year . If you advertise immediately , I guarantee by fall there wo n't be a single vacancy . Not one . So  --  in a word , congratulations . You 're saved ! You 've got a perfect location and the river is a great asset . You 'll have to clean things up a little all the old buildings have to go , including the house , which is worth nothing now . And of course , the old cherry orchard has to be cut down LYUBOV Cut down ? My dear man , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there is anything in this entire province that 's of note , it 's our cherry orchard . LOPAKHIN The only thing " of note " about your cherry orchard is that it 's big . You only get a crop once every two years and then nobody buys the cherries . GAYEV Our cherry orchard is mentioned in the encyclopedia . LOPAKHIN ( Looking at his watch . ) If we think of nothing and do nothing , the cherry orchard will be sold at auction on August twenty-second  --  along with this house and all the land . There 's no way out . I swear . I do n't see any other way . p. 16 FIRS In the old days , they dried the cherries , soaked them , preserved them , and made jam and  --  GAYEV Oh , Firs , will you be quiet ? FIRS we 'd send the dried cherries by cart to Moscow and Kharkov , and they brought in a lot of money ! The dried cherries were soft and juicy , sweet , and they smelled so good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LYUBOV How did they do it ? FIRS Nobody remembers . They forgot . SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK Tell us about Paris . Did you eat any frogs ? LYUBOV I ate crocodiles . SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK Incredible ! LOPAKHIN It used to be that out here in the country there were only landowners and poor people , but now all of a sudden there are summer folk and weekenders who want vacation homes . Every town you can name is surrounded by them , and in twenty years they 're going to multiply . Right now , these people are just sitting out on their balconies drinking tea , but soon they 'll start to cultivate their little gardens and then your cherry orchard will become happy , rich , luxurious GAYEV ( Indignant . ) What an outrageous thing to say ! ( Enter Varya and Yasha. ) p. 17 VARYA Mamochka , two telegrams came for you . ( Chooses a key and opens the antique bookcase . ) Here they are . LYUBOV From Paris . ( Rips them up without reading them . ) I 'm through with Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? Last week , I pulled out a drawer and guess what ? On the back , burned into the wood , was a date . This bookcase was made exactly one hundred years ago . Can you believe it ? It 's one hundred years old . We should have a birthday party . I mean , it is an inanimate object . That 's true . But , nevertheless , it is a bookcase . SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK ( Astonished . ) A hundred years old Incredible ! GAYEV Yes it 's the real thing . ( Lays his hand upon it . ) Most esteemed bookcase , I salute your existence . For the last one hundred years , thou hast borne the radiant ideals of truth and justice ; you have stood here for a century , silently calling out to us " Engage in fruitful labor . " You have inspired generation after generation of our family ( Almost in tears. ) with courage , with faith , with hope in a better tomorrow . You have instructed us , dear bookcase , in goodness and charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lyonya . You have n't changed a bit GAYEV ( Confused . ) Off the rail . Red ball/into the corner . LOPAKHIN ( Looks at his watch . ) Time 's up . YASHA ( Gives Lyubov a pillbox . ) Madam , your pills ? SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK Never take medicine , dear heart ; never does any good . Never does any harm either . Watch ! ( Dumps the contents of the pill-box into his hand , blows on them , puts them in his mouth , and swallows them , drinking a swig of coffee . ) There ! LYUBOV ( Alarmed . ) Are you insane ? SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK I took all the pills . LOPAKHIN Quite an appetite . ( They all laugh . ) FIRS ( Mutters . ) He was here over Easter week , ate half a barrel of cucumbers . ( Mutters . ) LYUBOV What 's he saying ? VARYA He 's been mumbling like this for the last three years . We 're used to it . p. 19 YASHA He 's senile . ( Enter Charlotta in a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lorgnette on her belt . She starts to cross the room . ) LOPAKHIN Excuse me , Charlotta , I have n't had a chance to say hello . ( Wants to kiss her hand . ) CHARLOTTA ( Pulls her hand away . ) If I allow you to kiss my hand , then you 'll want to kiss my elbow , then my shoulder LOPAKHIN Not my lucky day .

He 's a fine man . SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK One of the finest , in fact the very , very finest ! My Dashenka tells me she says she  --  ( He starts to snore , then immediately wakes up . ) However , lend me 240 rubles , dear . Could you ? Mortgage payment due tomorrow , you know VARYA ( Terrified . ) We ca n't ! There 's no money ! LYUBOV That 's true . We do n't have any money . SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK Something will turn up . ( Laughs . ) I never lose hope . There was a time I thought I was finished , and then , and then  --  a railroad was built right across my property , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never know . Dashenka just bought a lottery ticket . She could win two hundred thousand tomorrow . p. 21 LYUBOV Coffee 's finished . We can retire . FIRS ( Takes out a clothes brush and brushes Gayev 's clothes , scolding him . ) You put on the wrong trousers again . What am I going to do with you ? VARYA ( Softly . ) Anya 's asleep . ( Quietly opens the window . ) The sun 's already up . It 's getting warm outside . Look , Mamochka , look at the trees ! My God , smell the air ! And the birds are singing . GAYEV ( Opening the other window . ) The orchard is all white . You did n't forget , Lyuba ? The long path that stretches on and on straight as an arrow  --  and glows in the moonlight ? You remember ? You did n't forget ? LYUBOV ( Looks through the window at the orchard . ) Our childhood We were so innocent . I used to sleep in this room and look out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I woke up in the morning . And it has n't changed , it has n't changed at all . ( Laughs . ) White , white , it 's all so white !

The angels have n't forsaken you p. 22 GAYEV They 're going to sell the orchard for money . How strange LYUBOV Look ! There 's Mother dressed in white ! ( Laughs . ) GAYEV Where ? VARYA Mamochka For heavens ' sake . LYUBOV Oh . There 's no one there . I just imagined it . Look , on the right where the path turns by the summer house  --  there 's a little tree all bent over . Looks like a woman ( Enter Trofimov . He is dressed like a student and wears wire-rimmed glasses . ) TROFIMOV Lyubov Andreyevna ! ( She turns around and sees him . ) I just wanted to pay my respects . Then I 'll go . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until morning , but I could n't .

For what , my friend ? GAYEV Shhhhhh , Lyuba , shhhhhhhh LYUBOV Yes , that 's right . Anya 's sleeping . I 'm making too much noise . Well , Petya , what happened to you ? Why have you gotten so homely ? And why have you gotten old ? TROFIMOV Yes , on the train some woman called me a " shabby little man . " LYUBOV When you were with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student , and now your hair is thinning and you wear those awful glasses . ( Noting his student 's uniform . ) Have n't you graduated yet ?

She 's in the kitchen . She 's been waiting to see you since yesterday . p. 25 YASHA So ? VARYA You are a disgrace ! YASHA Well , what do I want her around for ? She could have come tomorrow . ( He goes . ) VARYA Mamochka is the same as she always was . If it were up to her , she 'd give everything away . GAYEV Yes .

I 've racked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole lot of different remedies ; but that means I do n't have a cure . It would be very nice to inherit a large fortune from somebody ; it would also be very nice to marry Anya off to a very rich man . It also would n't be a bad idea to go to Yaroslavl and ask Anya 's godmother if she 'd lend us the money ; Auntie is , after all , very , very rich . VARYA ( Bawls . ) If only God would help GAYEV Do n't howl ! The old lady may be very very rich but she does n't like us . First of all , my sister married a lawyer rather than a titled gentleman . ( Anya appears in the doorway . ) She not only married an untitled lawyer , but since he died , her behavior has not been  --  what you would call  --  altogether exemplary . She 's nice and kind and charming , and of course she 's my sister and I adore her , and there are a lot of extenuating circumstances , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with the utmost love  --  she is n't what you 'd call exactly moral .

The problem is , I only realize how stupid it is after I 'm done . VARYA She 's right , Uncle . You have to learn not to talk so much , that 's all . ANYA If you keep quiet , you 'll feel so much better . You know you will . p. 27 GAYEV I will , I will , I promise . ( Kisses Anya 's and Varya 's hands . ) I 'll keep quiet . Only right now I have to talk a little more . About business . On Thursday , I was at the courthouse and I got to talking to some people , about this and that  --  and one thing led to another  --  and well , they think I might be able to arrange a promissory note to pay the interest off to the bank .

Oh , there 's something I have to tell you  --  something awful happened after you left . You know all the retired servants are living out back in the old servants ' quarters  --  Polya , old Karp , Yefim  --  anyway , they started letting all kinds of people  --  vagrants  --  stay the night  --  I did n't say anything at first . But then they started spreading this rumor that I gave orders to feed them nothing but dried peas . Because I 'm so stingy I heard this started with Polya . So I thought fine . If this is how you want to play it , fine . And I sent for him . And he comes in And I say to him , " Polya , how dare you you stupid idiot " ( Looks at Anya . ) Anyechka ? ( Pause .

My springtime ( Curtain . The bells continue from morning bells to mourning bells. ) @x A field . An abandoned chapel fallen into disrepair . Near it , large stones , once gravestones . An old bench . Beyond , the road to Gayev 's estate . On one side , towering poplar trees ; behind them , the cherry orchard begins . In the distance , a row of telegraph poles , and in the far distance the indistinct signs of a large town visible only in clear weather . Near sunset . Charlotta , Yasha , and Dunyasha sit on the bench . They look out on the river . Yepikhodov stands nearby playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old military cap ; she takes a gun off her shoulder and straightens out the buckle on the belt . YEPIKHODOV ( Plays the guitar and sings , plays a popular song , not a folk song , from the genre known as " cruel romances .

( She looks at herself in a little mirror and powders her nose . ) YEPIKHODOV To a madman in love , this is a mandolin . ( Sings . ) " Can my own burning desire inflame my true love 's heart " ( Yasha sings harmony . ) CHARLOTTA You sing like pigs . Pah ! p. 31 DUNYASHA ( To Yasha . ) It must have been wonderful to be abroad . YASHA You 're right . It was . ( He yawns , lights a cigar . ) YEPIKHODOV In Europe , everything works . YASHA Agreed . YEPIKHODOV You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read . I read lots of interesting books . But I ca n't decide what I want to do , you know , for myself . That is , do I want to go on living or do I want to shoot myself in the head . That 's why I always carry a revolver around with me , just in case . Here it is . ( Shows a revolver . ) CHARLOTTA Right . Finished . ( Puts on gun . ) Yepikhodov , you 're very smart and very frightening . Women must absolutely adore you . B-r-r-r ! ( Going . ) But smart men are stupid . There 's no one for me to talk to . I 'm all alone . Alone . I hav no one . No idea who I am or why ( Leaves , not hurrying . ) YEPIKHODOV As a matter of fact , regardless of everything else , let me say among other things that well , it 's fate , fate has been merciless in her dealings with me , actually like , like a hurricane treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe I 'm wrong , but if I 'm wrong then why did I wake up this morning , for example , and find sitting on my chest the most enormous spider you 've ever seen  --  a spider of frightening proportion ?

( Sighs . ) DUNYASHA ( Embarrassed . ) Oh , all right Only get me my coat first . It 's near the cupboard It 's a little damp here . YEPIKHODOV All right . I 'll go . Now I know what to do with my gun . ( Takes his guitar and leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's a fool . DUNYASHA I hope to God he does n't shoot himself . ( Pause . ) I 'm so anxious these days . I 'm upset all the time . They took me in when I was a little girl , you know , and so I 'm not used to I mean , I 've always been , since I was a little girl so , well so refined . Look at my hands  --  white , white and soft , like a young lady 's . I 'm delicate and sensitive ; I 'm afraid of everything it 's really terrible and if you cheat on me , Yasha , I do n't know what I 'll do ! YASHA ( Kisses her . ) Mon petit chou-chou Just remember who you are . There 's nothing I like more than a nice girl . DUNYASHA I 'm madly in love with you . You 're so smart and so refined and you know so much ( Pause. ) p. 33 YASHA ( Yawns . ) In my opinion , any girl who says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pause . ) Nothing beats smoking a cigar in the fresh air . Nothing . ( Listens . ) That 's them ! ( Dunyasha throws her arms around him , impetuous . ) Go back to the house the other way and pretend like you were taking a swim in the river . I ca n't have them think we 've been together . I ca n't have them think that . DUNYASHA ( Coughs . ) Your cigar gave me a headache ( Leaves . Yasha remains , sitting near the chapel . Lyubov , Gayev , and Lopakhin enter . ) LOPAKHIN You have to make a decision . Time waits for no one . The question is utterly simple : will you agree to lease the land for summer cottages or not ? Answer in one word : yes or no . Just one word ! LYUBOV Who 's smoking those vile cigars here ? ( Sits down . ) GAYEV It 's so convenient now that the railroad is right here . ( He sits . ) Just imagine  --  we went into town today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to the house and play a game . LYUBOV There 's plenty of time for that . p. 34 LOPAKHIN Just one word ! ( Imploring . ) Please , give me your answer . GAYEV ( Yawns . ) What ? LYUBOV ( Glances into her purse . ) Yesterday I had a lot of money and today I do n't Poor Varya . She feeds us all on milk soup . The servants eat dried peas , and I somehow waste money . Senselessly . I do n't know why ( She drops her purse , the coins fly . ) Now look , I 've dropped it all . ( She is annoyed . ) YASHA Allow me . ( He picks up the money . ) LYUBOV Oh , thank you , Yasha . Why did I go to lunch there ? That restaurant of yours is terrible , Lyonya . It 's a terrible restaurant with a stupid band , and tablecloths that smell of soap . Why did you drink so much ? And eat so much ? And you talked too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point  --  talking about the seventies and the Decadent school of writing  --  to the waiters ! I mean , talking about the Decadents to the waiters ! Really ! LOPAKHIN Yes . GAYEV ( Waves his hand . ) Clearly , I 'm incorrigible . It 's obvious ( Irritable , to Yasha . ) Why are you always underfoot ? p. 35 YASHA ( Laughs . ) I ca n't hear your voice without laughing . GAYEV ( To his sister . ) It 's him or me . LYUBOV Leave , Yasha Go away YASHA ( Gives Lyubov her purse . ) Of course . ( Unable to contain his laughter . ) Instantly . ( He goes . ) LOPAKHIN Deriganov  --  do you know who he is ? He 's very rich and he intends to buy your estate . They say he 'll attend the auction in person . LYUBOV Who says ? LOPAKHIN People in town . GAYEV Our aunt in Yaroslavl promised to send something . I do n't know how much or when . LOPAKHIN How much ? A hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be grateful for small mercies . LOPAKHIN I 've never met people as frivolous or as unbusinesslike as the two of you ! It 's so strange . People tell you very clearly that your estate is about to be sold , and it 's as if you do n't understand . LYUBOV Well , what can we do ? Tell us . What can we possibly do ? p. 36 LOPAKHIN I 've told you and told you . Every day I tell you the same thing . The cherry orchard and the land must be subdivided and leased for cottages  --  immediately . The auction date is around the corner . Do n't you understand ? All you have to do is make up your minds to subdivide and you 'll have all the money you need . LYUBOV Summer people do n't know whether to scream or yell or fall to the ground and start to spit blood . You 're too much for me ! ( To Gayev . ) You 're like an old lady . GAYEV What ? LOPAKHIN You heard me . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) LYUBOV ( Frightened . ) No , do n't go away . Please . Wait , dear . Maybe we 'll think of something . LOPAKHIN What is there to think about ! LYUBOV Please do n't go away . It 's much more cheerful when you 're here . ( Pause . ) I keep expecting something is going to happen  --  that the house will just crash down around our ears if you 're gone . p. 37 GAYEV Yellow ball/side pocket . LYUBOV We 're guilty of so many sins . I know . LOPAKHIN What sins GAYEV ( Pops a fruit drop into his mouth . ) They say I 've eaten up my entire fortune in bon bons . LYUBOV What sins I 've wasted all my money . Just thrown it away like a madwoman , and I married a man who earned nothing but debts . My husband died of champagne  --  he could never stop drinking  --  and then , a month after he died , to my everlasting sorrow , I fell in love with another man . I one afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was my first punishment , like a blow to the head  --  just at that moment , right in this river my little boy drowned . And I fled ; just closed my eyes and ran , half crazy , wanting never to return , never to see this river again , and this man pursued me , mercilessly . I bought a villa near Menton . He got sick there and for three years I had no rest . Day and night I nursed him ; he tormented me ; and my soul shriveled up as if I 'd died . Last year , I sold the place to pay my debts , went to Paris , and he robbed me , took everything I had and went off with another woman . I tried to kill myself it was so silly , so shameful And then , all of a sudden , I got homesick , I needed to be back in Russia , I needed to be with my little girl . ( Wipes away tears . ) Oh , God . God , forgive me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her pocket . ) I received this today from Paris . He begs me to forgive him ; he wants me to come back . ( Tears up the telegram . ) Where is that music coming from ( Listens. ) p. 38 GAYEV That 's our famous Jewish orchestra . You remember  --  LYUBOV It still exists ? We should invite them somehow have a little party LOPAKHIN I do n't hear anything . ( Sings to himself . Laughs . ) I saw the funniest thing at the theatre last night . LYUBOV I 'm sure it was n't funny at all . You should n't go to plays . You ought to look at yourself . You lead a boring life and you say boring things . LOPAKHIN That 's true . That 's probably true . ( Pause . ) My father was dirt-poor and an idiot . He never taught me anything , and he did n't know anything . He was always drunk , and he used to beat me all the time , preferably with a stick . When I think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never learned anything ; my handwriting is illegible . In fact , I 'm embarrassed if anybody sees it . I write like a pig . LYUBOV You should get married , my dear . LOPAKHIN Yes I should . LYUBOV To our Varya . She 's a good girl . LOPAKHIN Yes . LYUBOV She comes from simple people . She works all day long . And most of all , she loves you . And you 've liked her for a long time . p. 39 LOPAKHIN Well , I 'm not against it She 's a good girl . ( Pause . ) GAYEV I 've been offered a position in a bank . Six thousand a year Did I tell you ? LYUBOV You 're not up to it . Stay right here . ( Enter Firs . He has brought an overcoat . ) FIRS ( To Gayev . ) It 's damp . Please put this on . GAYEV ( Putting on the coat . ) I 'm sick and tired of you . FIRS Is that so You left this morning without telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firs ! You 've gotten so old . FIRS I beg your pardon ? LOPAKHIN She says you 've gotten old . FIRS I 've been living a long time . They tried to marry me off before your father was born . ( Laughs . ) When Freedom came , I was the oldest valet . I did n't agree to be freed . I stayed with my masters . ( Pause . ) I remember when Freedom came , everyone was glad , but they did n't know why . LOPAKHIN The old days were good . At least everyone could count on getting flogged. p. 40 FIRS ( Not hearing . ) Exactly . We took care of our masters and our masters took care of us . Now everything 's in a muddle and you ca n't make head or tail of anything . GAYEV Be quiet , Firs I have to go into town tomorrow . I 've been promised an introduction to a general who might advance me money on a note . LOPAKHIN Nothing will come of that . And even if it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure . LYUBOV He 's hallucinating . There 's no general . ( Enter Trofimov , Anya , and Varya . ) GAYEV Ah ! Here come the children . ANYA Mama , here you are ! LYUBOV ( Tender . ) My darlings . ( Embracing Anya and Varya . ) If you only knew how much I love you ! Sit down next to me . So ( They sit . ) LOPAKHIN So our perpetual student is always with the ladies . TROFIMOV That 's none of your business . LOPAKHIN Almost fifty and still in school . TROFIMOV Stop the stupid jokes . p. 41 LOPAKHIN What are you so mad about ? TROFIMOV Stop goading me , will you ? LOPAKHIN ( Laughing . ) Let me ask you a question . When you look at me , what do you see ? TROFIMOV Well , when I look at you , I see a rich man who 'll soon be even richer . And just as the predator that devours everything in its path is necessary , so are you . ( Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the stars . LYUBOV No  --  let 's continue yesterday 's conversation . TROFIMOV About what ? GAYEV Pride . About whether Man should be Proud . TROFIMOV Yesterday Well we talked a long time yesterday but we did n't get anywhere . In your opinion , there is something almost mystical about pride . Maybe you 're right , but if you examine the question logically , then I ask you what kind of pride can we have in a being who is imperfectly made , physiologically speaking , and who in the vast majority of cases is stupid , common , and profoundly unhappy ? Are we supposed to sit around and admire ourselves ? No , we have to work , that 's all . p. 42 GAYEV Whatever you do you 're going to die . TROFIMOV Who knows ? And what does it mean to die ? Maybe man has a hundred senses and when he dies , only the five known to us die with him . Maybe the ninety-five others stay alive . LYUBOV Oh , Petya , you 're so smart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant . TROFIMOV There is progress ; man does try to reach perfection . And everything that is unattainable now will someday become real , but in the meantime , we all have to work and help those who seek to know the truth . In Russia only a very few of us actually work , and the vast majority of intellectuals whom I know from University do nothing . They call themselves intellectuals , but really they are just phonies and they treat their servants like animals . They learn slowly , they read without understanding , they rattle on about science and art though they know nothing about either . They are all very " serious . " They all have very " serious " faces , but they talk about trivial things while the vast majority of the people  --  ninety-nine percent  --  live like beasts , fighting and cursing at the slightest excuse . They have table manners like barnyard animals ; they sleep in the dirt with the fleas , and the garbage , and the stench ; they 're immoral , degenerate , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk only serves to delude us . Tell me , where are the childcare facilities and the literacy programs everyone talks so much about ? People write about them , but they do n't really exist . Only filth , vulgarity , and barbarism exist , I 'm afraid . I do n't trust " serious " faces . I hate " serious " conversation . In fact , it 's better if we keep quiet ! p. 43 LOPAKHIN You know , I get up every morning at five , work from early morning ' til late at night . I do business . With mine and other people 's money , and I see what people are really like . All you need to do is go to work one day in order to realize how few honest , decent people there really are . Sometimes when I ca n't sleep I think : Dear God , you gave us vast forests , endless fields , an infinite horizon . We should be giants . LYUBOV Giants ! Keep giants in fairy tales , please . They scare me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dreamily : ) There goes Yepikhodov . ANYA There goes Yepikhodov GAYEV The sun has set . TROFIMOV Yes . GAYEV ( As if reciting , quiet . ) O , Nature , you shine with an ever-lasting splendor , beautiful and indifferent ; you who are our mother , you giveth life and you taketh  --  VARYA ( Pleading . ) Uncle , please . ANYA Uncle , you 're doing it again  --  TROFIMOV We prefer " yellow ball/side pocket . " GAYEV Sorry , sorry . I 'll be quiet . ( They sit , pensive . Silence . Only the mumbling of Firs can be heard . Suddenly , a sound is heard from the distance , as though from heaven , a sound of a string breaking , dying away mournfully. ) p. 44 LYUBOV What was that ? LOPAKHIN I do n't know . Must be very far away  --  maybe a bucket in the mines broke its rope ?  --  But it 's very far away . GAYEV Maybe it was some kind of bird Like a heron ? TROFIMOV Or an owl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pause . ) FIRS Before the Catastrophe , the same thing happened . The owl hooted ; the samovar would n't stop singing . GAYEV Before what catastrophe ? FIRS Before Freedom . ( Pause . ) LYUBOV Let 's go in , my friends . It 's getting dark . ( The Vagrant coughs offstage . ) TROFIMOV Something 's coming . LYUBOV ( To Anya . ) You have tears in your eyes . What 's the matter with you ? ( Embraces her . ) ANYA Nothing , Mama . Really . TROFIMOV Something 's coming . ( Enter a vagrant in a shabby white cap and coat . He 's a little drunk. ) p. 45 VAGRANT Excuse me , can I get to the train station this way ? GAYEV Yes , it 's straight ahead . VAGRANT Thank you very very ( Coughing . ) Beautiful weather . ( He stops . To Varya : ) Mademoiselle , will you help a starving Russian with thirty kopecks ? ( Varya screams , frightened . ) LOPAKHIN ( Angry . ) Show some respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Take it . ( Looks in her purse . ) There you are . Nothing smaller , 30 It does n't matter Take a gold piece . Here . ( Gives him a gold piece . ) VAGRANT I 'm eternally grateful . ( He goes . All laugh . ) VARYA I 'm leaving ! I 'm leaving ! Oh , Mama , the people at home have nothing to eat and you gave that man a gold piece . LYUBOV What 's to be done with me ? I 'm so stupid when it comes to money . When we get home , I 'll give you all I have , and you can take care of it . ( To Lopakhin . ) Yermolai Alexeyich , will you lend me more money ? p. 46 LOPAKHIN Of course . LYUBOV Let 's go . It 's time . And Varya , we 've just made a match for you . Congratulations . VARYA ( Almost in tears . ) Mama , that 's nothing to joke about ! LOPAKHIN " Get thee to a nunnery , Amelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my horizons be remembered ! " LYUBOV Please let 's go . It 's time for supper . GAYEV My hands are shaking . I have n't played billiards in a long time . LOPAKHIN Let me remind you once again , the cherry orchard will be sold on August twenty-second . Think about it , please think about it VARYA That man scared me . My heart is pounding . ( They all leave except Trofimov and Anya . ) ANYA ( Laughs . ) I 'm glad that man scared Varya . Now we can be alone . TROFIMOV Varya 's so afraid we 'll fall in love she wo n't leave us alone for a minute . She is incapable of understanding the fact that we are above love . The sole purpose of our lives is to rid ourselves of all illusions , all that prevents us from being happy and free . Forward , friends ! We must march forward towards that bright shining star ! Follow us , friends ! Do n't lag behind ! p. 47 ANYA ( Clapping her hands . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a gorgeous day ? TROFIMOV Yes , the weather 's been very nice lately . ANYA What have you done to me , Petya ? I do n't love the cherry orchard the way I used to . I used to love it so much I thought there was no better place on earth than our orchard . TROFIMOV The whole country is our orchard . The earth is big and beautiful and there are so many wonderful places in it . ( Pause . ) Think , Anya . Your grandfather and his father , and his father 's father  --  they owned people ; they owned human beings . These people who worked the estate slaved for them . Ca n't you see them ? Does n't something human look out at you from every blossom , every leaf , every branch ? Do n't you hear their voices ? It 's terrible . Your orchard is terrible . And in the evening , when you walk through it , the cherry trees dream , they remember what happened a hundred and two hundred years ago and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your uncle you do n't realize that you live in debt , that you are indebted to those people you have n't admitted further than the entrance hall We are two hundred years behind the times in this country ; we have no understanding of our own history . So we get depressed or we drink , but it 's clear that in order to begin to live healthily , we have to first atone for the past so we can put it to rest . And we can only make atonement through suffering and hard , relentlessly hard work . p. 48 ANYA The house we live in has never really been ours , has it ? I 'll leave , I promise TROFIMOV If you have the keys to the house , throw them away and go . Be as free as the wind ! ANYA ( Radiant . ) I love the way you talk ! TROFIMOV Believe me , Anya . I may be young ; I 'm still a student , but I have already gone through so much in my life . Every winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor as a beggar ; but my soul is my own . Every minute of the day and night I see things , I feel things . And I see happiness coming , Anya . I tell you , I can see it . ANYA ( Thoughtful . ) The moon is rising . ( Far away Yepikhodov plays his guitar , the same mournful song . The moon rises . ) TROFIMOV Yes , the moon is rising . ( Pause . ) Here it comes . Happiness . It 's rising , it 's getting closer and closer . And if we do n't see it , if we ever fail to recognize it , it does n't matter because others will see it . VARYA ( Offstage . ) Anya , where are you ? TROFIMOV Varya again . ( Angry . ) Why wo n't she leave us alone ! p. 49 ANYA Let 's go down to the river . TROFIMOV Yes . Let 's go . ( They go . ) VARYA 'S VOICE Anya ! Anya ! ( Firs enters , mumbling , searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charlotta has entered . ) FIRS ( Mumbling . ) Oh , you bungler ! CHARLOTTA ( Sits on bench , takes off her cap . ) Is that you , Firs ? What are you looking for ? FIRS Madam lost her purse CHARLOTTA Here 's a fan And a handkerchief smells of perfume . ( Pause . ) There 's nothing else . Lyubov Andreyevna is constantly losing things . Like her own life . ( She quietly hums a little song . ) I do n't have a real passport so I do n't know how old I am . I have a feeling I 'm young ( She puts her cap on Firs . He sits motionless . ) Oh , I love you ! ( Laughs . ) Ein , zwei , drei !

Me  --  the cook , Vasilli , the son of the deacon 's father  --  and here , right on the rock over here , a man was sitting Someone , a stranger , somebody 's um For some reason I got scared  --  and I left and then  --  without me  --  they killed him He had money . CHARLOTTA Well . Weiter . FIRS So the trial took place . The judges came in droves . They started questioning They took them away . Me , too . I sat in prison for two years Then nothing .

( Mumbles to himself . ) We all left there together , and there was a station stop . My friend jumped from the cart took a sack , looks in the sack and there is another sack . And he looks and there 's something inside , it twitches  --  and he jerks it shut . CHARLOTTA ( Laughs quietly. ) jerks it shut ( Eats the cucumber . The moon rises Somewhere near the poplars , Varya looks for Anya . ) VARYA Anya , where are you ? ( Curtain. ) @x A receiving room separated by an arch from the ballroom . A lit chandelier . A Jewish orchestra , the one referred to in Act Two , plays in the entrance hall . It is evening . The crowd is dancing a grand-rond . The following couples dance through the receiving room  --  Simeonov-Pishchik and Charlotta , Trofimov and Lyubov Andreyevna ; then Anya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , and finally Dunyasha and her partner . Varya cries quietly , wiping away tears , as she dances . SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK 'S VOICE Promenade une paire . Grand-rond balance ! Les cavaliers genoux et remerciez vos dames ! ( Firs , wearing tails , carries a tray with seltzer water . Simeonov-Pishchik and Trofimov enter the receiving room . ) SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK High blood pressure ; two strokes . I 'm not supposed to dance , but as the man says : " When in Rome " Actually , I 'm healthy as a horse . My father , God rest him , was a real joker . He used to say that our family descends from a long and distinguished line that originated with  --  listen to this  --  the Emperor Caligula 's horse ! The one he made into a senator . ( He sits . ) Our trouble is : We have no money . And like they say , " a hungry dog dreams only of meat .

Varya appears in the archway . ) TROFIMOV ( Teasing . ) Mrs. Lopakhin ! VARYA ( Angrily . ) Shabby little  --  ! ( Ca n't speak . ) TROFIMOV Yes . And proud of it . VARYA ( Bitter . ) Well , we hired the musicians . I 'd like to know how we 're going to pay for them . ( Exits . ) TROFIMOV ( To Pishchik . ) You know , all the energy you 've put into paying off your debts all your life  --  if you 'd put half that energy into something useful , you could have shaken the world . SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK Nietzsche the philosopher a man of incredible genius I mean , an enormous brain he says in his books that it 's all right to forge money . TROFIMOV Have you read Nietzsche ?

The music ends. ) p. 53 LYUBOV ( Humming the Lezginka , a dance . ) Why is n't my brother here ? What is he doing in town all this time ? Dunyasha ! Offer the musicians some tea . TROFIMOV Looks like the auction did n't take place . LYUBOV The musicians should n't have come . It 's the wrong time for a party but never mind . ( She sits , hums quietly . ) CHARLOTTA ( Handing a deck of cards to Pishchik . ) Pick a card . Any card . SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK All right . CHARLOTTA Shuffle the deck . Very good .

How could you possibly be in love ? ( She shrugs her shoulders , mutters in German : ) Guter Mensch aber schlechter Musikant . TROFIMOV ( Claps Pishchik on the shoulder . ) Good horsie . CHARLOTTA Your attention please . Another trick . ( Takes a blanket from a chair . ) Here 's a very nice blanket . I want to sell it ( Shakes it . ) Do I have a buyer ? SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK ( Awestruck . ) Incredible ! CHARLOTTA Ein , zwei , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is revealed , curtsies , runs to her mother , embraces her , and runs back into the ballroom amid general applause . ) LYUBOV ( Applauds . ) Bravo ! Bravo ! CHARLOTTA Once more . Ein , zwei , drei ! ( Lifts the blanket , revealing Varya , who bows . ) SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK ( Astonished . ) Incredible ! p. 55 CHARLOTTA The end ! ( She curtsies , throws the blanket over Pishchik and runs into the ballroom . Music . ) SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK ( Runs after her . ) You little witch ! ( Laughing happily . ) I 'm going to get you ! ( He exits . ) LYUBOV Leonid still is n't here ; I do n't understand what 's keeping him . It must be all over by now Either the estate was sold or there has n't been an auction at all . Why keep us in suspense like this ? ! VARYA ( Tries to soothe her . ) Uncle bought it . I 'm sure of it . TROFIMOV ( Sarcastic . ) Oh , right . VARYA Our great-aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her name . She did it for Anya . And Uncle will buy it , with God 's help . LYUBOV She sent us fifteen thousand rubles to buy the estate . She does n't believe us ; that 's not enough money to pay off the interest . ( Covers her face in her hands . ) Today , I 'll know my fate . My whole life is being decided today TROFIMOV ( Teasing Varya . ) Mrs. Lopakhin ! p. 56 VARYA ( Angrily . ) You are a perpetual student ! You 'll never graduate ! You 've already been expelled from University twice ! LYUBOV Varya , why are you so angry ? He 's only teasing you . If you want to marry Lopakhin , you should marry him . He 's a good , interesting man . But if you do n't want to marry him , no one 's forcing you , darling . VARYA It 's nothing to joke about , Mother . I am serious about him . He is a good man and I like him . LYUBOV Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! VARYA I ca n't propose to him myself ! For two years people have been telling me to marry him , but he does n't say a word about it . Or he makes jokes I know he 's busy getting rich and he 's occupied with his business affairs . He does n't have time for me If I had money , even a little  --  even one hundred rubles  --  I would abandon everything and go far , far away . I would enter a convent TROFIMOV Ah , bliss ! VARYA ( To Trofimov . ) I thought students were supposed to be smart ! ! ( Softening , almost crying . ) Oh , Petya , you 've gotten to be so homely , and you 're old . ( To Lyubov , in a normal tone . ) I just need something to do , Mama ; I need to have something to do , every minute . ( Yasha enters ) p. 57 YASHA ( Barely controlling his laughter . ) Yepikhodov broke a billiard cue ! ( He exits . ) VARYA What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't understand these people . ( Goes out . ) LYUBOV Do n't tease her , Petya . Ca n't you see how miserable she is ? TROFIMOV She 's always poking her nose into other people 's affairs . All summer she has n't left me and Anya alone ; she 's so afraid we 'd fall in love . Is it any of her business ? Anyway , she has no reason to worry . I do n't concern myself with such banalities . We are above love ! LYUBOV And I gather that means I am below love . ( Very agitated . ) Why is n't Leonid here ? I just want to know if the estate has been sold or not . I ca n't believe this is actually happening . I 'm lost I feel like scr  --  help me , Petya . Say something anything TROFIMOV Whether the estate was sold today or not  --  does it really matter ? It was lost a long time ago ; there 's no turning back . Try to calm down and stop deluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . LYUBOV What truth ? You seem so sure of what 's true and what 's false . Well , I 'm not so sure . I seem to have lost my sight . I ca n't see anything clearly anymore . You answer all of life 's questions boldly . But tell me , darling , is n't that because you are young , because you have n't had to suffer through any of life 's problems yet from beginning to end ? You do n't know what horrors are lurking just around the next corner . You do n't know because you know nothing about life ! Yes , you young people are more courageous than my generation , you have more character , you 're better educated , but ca n't you be just a little kinder ? Petya , I was born here , my mother and father lived here ; my grandfather too . I love this house . I can not understand my life without it . I can not understand my life without the orchard . And if it really has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! ( Embraces Trofimov , kisses his forehead . ) My son drowned here ( Cries . ) Have some pity , dear . p. 58 TROFIMOV I do pity you . From the bottom of my heart . LYUBOV You should have said that just a little differently ( Takes out a handkerchief . A telegram falls to the floor . ) I 'm so miserable today . You have no idea . It 's so noisy here ; and I ca n't go to my room . I 'm afraid to be alone  --  afraid of the silence . Do n't judge me too harshly , Petya I love you like you were one of the family . I 'd gladly let Anya marry you except you have to finish your studies . It 's strange ; you do n't do anything . You drift from place to place . That 's the truth , is n't it ? And you have to do something about your beard . To make it grow somehow . ( Laughs . ) You look absurd . TROFIMOV ( Picks up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LYUBOV This telegram 's from Paris . I receive one every day . Yesterday and today That madman is sick again ; it 's bad . He begs me to forgive him , implores me to come back And I really should go to Paris to be near him . Petya , do n't look so stern . What can I do , darling ? What am I supposed to do ? He 's sick ; he 's alone ; he 's unhappy . And who is going to look after him ? Who is going to keep him out of trouble and make sure he takes his medicine on time ? And why should I hide it , why should I keep silent about it ? I love him . That 's all . I love him , I love him This love is a stone tied around my neck and I 'll sink to the bottom with him , but he 's mine , and I ca n't live without him . ( Squeezes Trofimov 's hand . ) Do n't think badly of me , Petya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything p. 59 TROFIMOV ( Through his tears . ) For God 's sake , forgive me for saying this , but this man robbed you ! LYUBOV No , no , no . You must n't talk like that . ( She covers her ears . ) TROFIMOV He 's no good . Everyone seems to know this but you ! He 's a worthless scoundrel . A nobody ! LYUBOV ( Trying to restrain her anger . ) And you are what ? You 're twenty-six or twenty-seven years old and it 's as if you 're still a schoolboy ! TROFIMOV What ? ! LYUBOV You ought to be a man ; at your age you should understand people in love . You should love someone  --  you  --  you should fall in love ! ( Angry . ) Yes , yes you ! You 're not so pure , you 're just a prude ! You 're just a ridiculous , ugly little freak ! TROFIMOV ( Horrified . ) What are you saying ? ! LYUBOV " I 'm above love . " You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're what our Firs calls a bungler . Not to have a lover at your age ? Shame on you ! TROFIMOV ( In horror . ) This is horrible ! What are you saying ? ( Runs to the hall , putting his hands to his head . ) This is horrible . I 'm leaving . ( Goes out , returns immediately . ) Everything is over between us ! ( Exits . Music ends. ) p. 60 LYUBOV Petya , wait ! I was only joking , you silly boy ! Petya ! ( A clatter from the entrance hall . Someone has fallen down the stairs . Anya and Varya shout , then immediate laughter . ) What happened ? ( Anya runs in laughing . ) ANYA Petya fell down the stairs ! ( She runs out . ) LYUBOV What a ridiculous young man ( In the ballroom , the Stationmaster stops in the middle of the hall , gets on a chair and reads the opening lines of " The Magdalen " by A. Tolstoy translated by Paul Schmidt . ) STATIONMASTER The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dancers whirls around the room ; And there apart , an empty glass beside her , Behold the fallen beauty , the lost , the doomed:Her lavish gown and jewels make all eyes wonder , Her shameless glance bespeaks a life of sin ; Young men and old cast longing glances at her  --  See , how her fatal beauty draws them in ! * See Special Note on copyright page . ( The others listen , but after only a few lines , a waltz is heard and they all start to dance again . Trofimov returns. ) p. 61 LYUBOV Well , Petya my innocent creature . Please forgive me Let 's dance . ( She dances with Trofimov . Anya and Varya dance . Firs enters , putting his cane near the door . Yasha enters and watches the dancers . ) YASHA What is it , Grandpa ? FIRS I do n't feel well . In the old days , generals , barons , and admirals used to dance at our balls , but tonight we sent for the postal clerk and the stationmaster and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived too long ; I do n't feel well . The old master used to doctor everybody  --  with sealing wax  --  for every ailment . I 've been taking sealing wax daily for the last twenty years I probably owe my life to it . YASHA ( Yawns . ) You bore me . You should be put to sleep . FIRS ( Muttering . ) Mean little bungler ( Trofimov and Lyubov dance through the ballroom into the receiving room . ) LYUBOV Merci . I 'll sit down ( Sits . ) I 'm tired . ( Anya enters . ) ANYA ( Agitated . ) A man in the kitchen a few moments ago said the cherry orchard was sold today . p. 62 LYUBOV Sold to whom ? ANYA He did n't say . He left . ( Dances out into the ballroom with Trofimov . ) YASHA Some old goat was just talking . He is n't from around here . FIRS And Leonid Andreyich has n't come back yet . He left wearing only a light overcoat . Just watch : he 'll catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . Yasha , go and find out to whom it was sold . YASHA The man 's gone . He left a long time ago . ( Laughs . ) LYUBOV ( Annoyed . ) What are you laughing at ? What are you happy about ? YASHA It 's Yepikhodov . He 's ridiculous ! The Walking Disaster . LYUBOV Firs  --  if the estate is sold , where will you go ? FIRS I 'll go wherever you tell me to go . LYUBOV What 's wrong ? Your face looks so strange . Are you sick ? You should go to bed FIRS Yes , yes ( With a smile . ) Go to bed And who 'll serve the drinks and give the orders ? I have the whole house on my shoulders . p. 63 YASHA ( To Lyubov . ) Lyubov Andreyevna ! May I ask you a favor ? If you go to Paris again , would you be so kind as to take me with you ? Please ! It 's utterly impossible for me to stay here . ( Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  this is an uncivilized country , with absolutely no culture , vulgar people , and besides , it 's boring . The food in the kitchen is disgraceful , and that old Firs walks around muttering all kinds of idiocies . Please take me with you ! ( Pishchik enters . ) SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK May I have the pleasure of a little waltz , beautiful lady ? ( Lyubov goes to him . ) And a tiny loan ? ( They dance . ) Just 180 little rubles , please ( They dance into the ballroom . ) It 's nothing ; 180 little rubles YASHA ( Sings softly . ) " Sweet lady , will you be mine " ( In the ballroom , a figure in checked pants and a gray top hat waves its hands . Cries of " Bravo , Charlotta , bravo ! " ) DUNYASHA ( Stops to powder her nose . ) The young mistress ordered me to dance  --  there are lots of gentlemen and no ladies . My head 's spinning and my heart 's pounding a mile a minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said something to me that almost took my breath away . p. 64 FIRS What did he tell you ! DUNYASHA You , he says , are like a flower . YASHA ( Yawns . ) What does he know about it ? ( He goes out . ) DUNYASHA Like a flower . I 'm such a delicate young lady . I love romance . FIRS He turned your head . ( Enter Yepikhodov . ) YEPIKHODOV ( To Dunyasha . ) Why do you look at me like I 'm some kind of bug ? ( Sighs . ) What kind of life is this ? DUNYASHA What do you want ? YEPIKHODOV I mean , without a doubt , you may even be right . ( Sighs . ) But if you consider the matter in that light , then excuse my candor , but really it 's you  --  you have reduced me to that state of mind . Look , I know what my life is . I look on it as a huge misfortune , but still , I 'm accustomed to it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fate and I can even smile ; and though I  --  DUNYASHA Please , leave me alone . We 'll talk later , I 'm dreaming now . ( She plays with her fan. ) p. 65 YEPIKHODOV Every day something terrible happens to me , and I  --  excuse me for saying so  --  ( Varya enters from the ballroom . ) VARYA Have n't you gone yet ? You 're incredibly presumptuous . ( To Dunyasha . ) Go away , Dunyasha . ( To Yepikhodov . ) You 're either playing billiards , breaking a billiard cue , or wandering around the halls like a guest . YEPIKHODOV If I may say so , you have no right to reprimand me that way . VARYA I am merely telling you that all you do around here is stroll around and bump into the furniture . You never do any work . I do n't know why we even employed you ; we do n't need an accountant . YEPIKHODOV ( Insulted . ) How I walk , or how I eat , or how I play billiards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about  --  VARYA How dare you talk to me like that ? ( Flying into a rage . ) You mean to insinuate that I do n't know anything ? How dare you ! Get out ! Get out this minute ! Leave ! YEPIKHODOV ( Scared . ) I only meant that you should speak to me a little more  --  politely . p. 66 VARYA ( Losing control . ) Get out this minute ! Out ! ( He goes to the door , she follows . ) Do n't ever come here again ! Do n't ever let me see your face here again ! You are a walking disaster ! ( Yepikhodov goes out . ) YEPIKHODOV ( His voice from behind the door . ) I 'm issuing a complaint against you . VARYA Oh , really ? Come back in here ! ( She picks up the cane Firs left by the door . ) Come on ! Come on ! I 'll show you ! Are you coming ? Huh ? Huh ? Are you coming ? Take that ! ( She swings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most humbly thank you . VARYA ( Still angry but laughing and sarcastic . ) Guilty ! LOPAKHIN Not at all . Thank you for the warm welcome . VARYA Do n't mention it . ( Moves away a bit , then looks around and asks softly . ) Did I hurt you ? LOPAKHIN No , it 's nothing . I 'm going to have a huge lump , that 's all . VOICES ( From the ballroom and hall . ) Lopakhin is here ! He 's back ! Lopakhin everyone ! ( People crowd into the receiving room. ) p. 67 SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK Now we 'll see what there is to see and hear what there is to hear ( Kisses Lopakhin . ) You smell of brandy , my friend . We 've been enjoying ourselves here as well . ( Lyubov enters . ) LYUBOV Is that you , Yermolai Alexeyich ? Where have you been all this time ? Where 's Leonid ? LOPAKHIN He came with me . He 's coming . LYUBOV ( Disturbed , nervous . ) What happened ? Did they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to reveal his joy . ) The auction was over by four o'clock . We were late for the train and had to wait till half past nine . ( Sighs heavily . ) My head 's spinning a little My God . I feel a little giddy ( Enter Gayev ; in his right hand he carries things he 's bought ; with his left he dries his eyes . ) LYUBOV Lyonya , what is it ? Lyonya Well ? ( Impatient , with tears . ) Tell me quickly , for God 's sake ! GAYEV ( Does not answer ; waves his hand . Crying , he speaks to Firs . ) Here , take these Anchovies and herring I have n't eaten anything all day . You have no idea what I 've been through . ( The door of the billiard room is open . We hear Yasha 's voice and the sounds of billiard balls clicking. ) p. 68 YASHA ( Offstage . ) Yellow ball/side pocket ! GAYEV ( His expression changes . He is no longer crying . ) I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He goes through the hall to his room , Firs following . ) SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK What happened at the auction ? Tell us all about it ! LYUBOV Is the cherry orchard sold ? LOPAKHIN Sold . LYUBOV Who bought it ? LOPAKHIN I did . ( Pause . Lyubov is overcome . She would fall if she were not standing near a chair and a table . Varya removes the keys from her belt , throws them on the floor in the middle of the room , and goes out . ) I bought it ! Wait just a moment , ladies and gentlemen , my head is spinning , I ca n't speak ( Laughs . ) We got to the auction . Deriganov was already there . Leonid Andreyich had only fifteen thousand , and Deriganov offered thirty thousand above the mortgage right away . When I saw that , I fought him . I bid forty . He bid forty-five ; I bid fifty-five . He went five thousand better , and I added ten thousand each time . Finally it was over . I bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cherry orchard 's now mine ! Mine ! ( Roars with laughter . ) My God , oh God , the cherry orchard 's mine ! Tell me I 'm drunk , tell me I 'm out of my mind , tell me I 'm dreaming ! ( Stamps his feet . ) Do n't laugh at me ! If my father and grandfather could only rise from the dead and see what 's happened  --  that their Yermolai  --  beaten , ignorant , unschooled Yermolai , who used to run around barefoot in winter  --  this same Yermolai has bought the most beautiful estate in the world . I bought the estate on which my father and my grandfather were slaves , where they were n't even allowed to enter the kitchen . I 'm sleeping . This is a dream , this is a delusion ! This is a figment of my imagination ! ( Picks up the keys , smiles . ) She threw away the keys . She wants to show us she 's no longer mistress here . ( Jingles the keys . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heard tuning up . ) Hey ! Musicians ! Play ! I want music ! Come on everyone , watch Yermolai Lopakhin take an axe to the cherry orchard ! Watch the old trees fall ! We 'll build beautiful summer cottages and our grandsons and great-grandsons will see a new life here  --  music ! ( Lyubov takes a seat , cries . Reproachfully : ) Why , why did n't you listen to me ? You poor woman . There 's no going back now . ( With tears in his eyes . ) If only the whole thing was finished , the whole unhappy , stupid life of ours  --  changed . p. 69 SIMEONOV-PISHCHIK ( Takes Lopakhin under the arm ; under his breath : ) She 's crying . Let 's go into the hall ; let 's leave her alone Come on ( Leads him into the ballroom . ) LOPAKHIN What 's the matter ? Music ! Go on , you do as I tell you ! ( With irony . ) The new master , the owner of the cherry orchard has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident and nearly upsets the candelabra . ) Do n't worry . I can pay for everything ! ( Goes off with Pishchik . The musicians play . Nobody remains except Lyubov , who sits in the chair , crying . The music plays softly . Anya and Trofimov come in quickly . Anya goes to her mother and kneels in front of her . Trofimov stands at the entrance to the ballroom . ) ANYA Mama Mama , are you crying ? You are dear , kind , good , beautiful  --  my beautiful mother  --  I love you God forgive us . The cherry orchard is sold . It will no longer exist , it 's true , but do n't cry . Mama , you still have your life ahead of you your soul , your beautiful soul is your own . Come with me ; come away from here with me . We 'll plant a new orchard , more beautiful than this one , and then you 'll see , you 'll understand , and a deep soothing joy will embrace you , like the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , darling , let 's go ! ( Curtain . Music continues. ) @x Same as Act One . There are no curtains on the windows , no pictures ; only a few pieces of furniture remain , piled up in a corner as if for sale . There is a feeling of emptiness . There are bundles and suitcases by the door and against the back wall , etc . The door to the left is open ; we can hear Varya 's and Anya 's voices through it . Lopakhin stands and waits . Yasha holds a tray with little glasses filled with champagne . In the hall , Yepikhodov ties up a box . The rumble of voices are heard off ; the local people have come to say goodbye . Gayev 's voice is heard : GAYEV 'S VOICE Thank you , my friends , thank you good people , thank you . YASHA ( To Lopakhin . ) Some of the locals come to say goodbye . My opinion is : they may be " good people , " but what do they know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lyubov and Gayev come in from the hall ; she is not crying , but she is shaking and her face is pale . She can not speak . ) GAYEV You gave them your purse , Lyuba . That 's not right ! It 's not right ! LYUBOV I could n't I could n't ( Both go out . Lopakhin follows them to the door. ) p. 71 LOPAKHIN Let 's all have a farewell drink . Please ? ! I forgot to bring wine from the city , but I found one bottle at the train station . Please ? ! ( Pause . ) Do n't you want any ? ( Moves away from the door . ) If I 'd known , I would n't have bought it . Well then I wo n't drink . ( Yasha carefully puts the tray down on a chair . ) Go on , Yasha . You might as well have one . YASHA To those who are leaving and to those who are left behind ! ( He drinks . ) This is not the real thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Pause . ) It 's freezing in here . YASHA We did n't bother making a fire today . We 're all leaving . ( Laughs . ) LOPAKHIN What are you laughing about ? YASHA I 'm happy . LOPAKHIN It 's already October , but it 's sunny , no wind . Like summer . Good building weather . ( Looking at his watch as he stands in the doorway . ) Friends , bear in mind chat you have only forty-six minutes to catch your train . That means you have to start for the station in twenty minutes . Hurry up . ( Enter Trofimov from outside ; he wears an overcoat. ) p. 72 TROFIMOV It 's time to go . The horses are here . God knows where my galoshes are . They 're lost . ( In the doorway . ) Anya , I ca n't find my galoshes ! Anya ! LOPAKHIN I 'm going to Kharkov . I 'm taking the same train as you . Spending the winter there . I 've wasted my time here with you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep my hands occupied , they feel like they do n't belong to me somehow . TROFIMOV Well once we 're gone you can resume your useful occupation . LOPAKHIN Have a glass of champagne . TROFIMOV No . Thanks . LOPAKHIN So you 're off to Moscow ? TROFIMOV Yes I 'm accompanying them into town today and then tomorrow I 'll leave for Moscow . LOPAKHIN I see  --  your professors have n't started teaching yet ; they 're waiting for you to arrive . TROFIMOV That 's none of your business . LOPAKHIN How many years did you say you 've been studying at the University ? TROFIMOV Think of something new , will you ? That 's gotten old . And feeble . ( Looking for his galoshes . ) You know , I do n't think we 'll see each other again , so allow me to leave you with one piece of advice : do n't wave your arms around so much . It 's a bad habit . And this building summer cottages and expecting the residents to improve the land  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway I like you  --  in spite of everything . You have gentle , refined hands , like an artist 's You 're gentle and refined , too deep down . p. 73 LOPAKHIN ( Embraces him . ) Goodbye Thank you for everything Here , let me give you some money , for the trip . TROFIMOV What for ? I do n't need it . LOPAKHIN You do n't have any ! TROFIMOV Yes I do , thank you . I got paid for a translation I did . It 's right here in my pocket . ( Worried . ) But I ca n't find my galoshes ! VARYA ( From the next room . ) Take your nasty things with you ! ( She throws a pair of rubber galoshes into the room . ) TROFIMOV Why are you angry , Varya ? Hmmm These are n't my galoshes ! LOPAKHIN I planted poppy seed on a thousand acres in the spring , and I made forty thousand clear . When the poppy fields were in bloom , it was like a painting ! I offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why turn up your nose at it ? Because of what I come from ? TROFIMOV Your father was a sharecropper ; mine was a druggist . So what ? ( Lopakhin reaches into his pocket for his wallet . ) No , no Even if you offered me two hundred thousand I would n't take it . I 'm a free man . What you all  --  rich and poor  --  value so highly has no power over me . It 's like smoke ; it floats through the air . I can manage without it ; I can pass you all by . I 'm strong and proud . Humanity is marching towards a higher truth , towards the highest form of happiness on earth , and I am in the front ranks ! p. 74 LOPAKHIN Will you get there ? TROFIMOV I 'll get there . ( Pause . ) I 'll get there or point the others the way . ( Axes cutting the trees are heard in the distance . ) LOPAKHIN Well , friend , it 's time to go . We 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Do you know , when I work hard for a long time , around the clock  --  do you know my mind actually gets clearer and I almost begin to understand what I 'm here for ? No , really . Just think how many people go through their lives and never know what they 're doing or why they 're doing it But that 's neither here nor there . I hear Leonid Andreyich got a job at a bank  --  six thousand a year But he wo n't keep the job ; he 's too lazy . ANYA ( In the doorway . ) Mama wants you to please wait until she 's gone before you chop down any more trees ! TROFIMOV That was pretty tactless . ( Goes out into the front hall . ) LOPAKHIN All right All right ( Exits after him . ) ANYA Have they taken Firs to the hospital ? YASHA I told them to this morning . I think they sent him . p. 75 ANYA ( To Yepikhodov , who crosses the room . ) Yepikhodov , find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . YASHA ( Insulted . ) I gave the order this morning . What 's the use of asking for the same thing ten times over ? YEPIKHODOV Old Firs , ultimately , in my opinion , is beyond repair . He ca n't be mended ; he should be sent to his grave . I actually envy him . ( Steps on a hatbox and crushes it . ) Of course . Now I 've done it . I knew it would end this way . ( Exits . ) YASHA ( Mocking . ) The walking disaster VARYA ( From behind the door . ) Has Firs been taken to the hospital ? ANYA They 've taken him . VARYA Why did n't they take the letter to the doctor ? ANYA It 'll have to be sent after him . ( Goes out . ) VARYA ( From the adjoining room . ) Where 's Yasha ? Tell him his mother arrived ; she wants to say goodbye to him . YASHA ( With a gesture . ) I 'm losing my patience . ( Dunyasha , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that his alone. ) p. 76 DUNYASHA Just look at me , Yasha , just one tiny look . You 're leaving You 're leaving me behind ( Cries and throws herself on his neck . ) YASHA What are you crying for ? ( Drinks champagne . ) In six days I 'll be in Paris again . Tomorrow , we 'll board the express train , and off we 'll go ; never to be seen again . It 's almost too good to be true . Vive la France ! I ca n't live here ; it is n't my style . I 've seen enough ignorance to last me a lifetime . ( Drinks champagne . ) What are you crying for ? If you had behaved yourself , there 'd be nothing to cry about . DUNYASHA ( Powders her nose . ) Write me from Paris . I loved you , Yasha . I loved you so much ! I 'm a sensitive person , Yasha . Really I am . YASHA Someone 's coming .
