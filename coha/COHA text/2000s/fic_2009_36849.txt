Marlita , " the man said again , standing just inside the door to her office . He regarded Marla with an expression of mingled admiration and delight , extending his arms for a hug . <br> Marla Mason  --  ruthlessly pragmatic chief sorcerer of Felport , a woman who 'd recently outwitted the avatar of Death , who 'd once kicked a hellhound across a room , who 'd thwarted the king of nightmares , and who had even killed a god ( admittedly a very implausible one )  --  stood behind her desk and stared at him . She 'd already said his name once . She did n't think she could bring herself to say it again just yet . There was a dagger in her hand  --  when had she picked that up ?  --  and she gently put it down . " You . Here . Why ? " <br> " Eloquent as always , little sis . " He came around the desk and swept her into his arms . <br> " Jason . " She spoke into his shoulder , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smoke-and-whiskey scent of a bar 's back room . She had n't seen him in almost eighteen years . The time she 'd spent without her brother in her life was , by now , years longer than the time they 'd been close . Marla pulled away . " How did you find me ? " <br> " You look beautiful , Marlita . " He swept a stray strand of hair out of her eyes , and Marla froze . How long had it been since anyone had touched her so familiarly , so easily ? Even her occasional lovers were tentative ; they knew her well enough to be afraid a little , even in their intimacy . Jason was n't tentative at all . He was family . <br> She grabbed his wrist , hard . " I asked you a question . " <br> Marla was tall for a woman , but Jason had a couple of inches on her . He did n't fight , though . " A man ca n't visit his sister ? " His voice was a perfect blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded feelings . Finely honed . She felt instantly guilty . Jason still had the knack of manipulation . No surprise there . <br> Marla let go of his wrist . She took a step back and frowned , looking him up and down . He was past thirty-five now , and his lean good looks were touched with something harder , something that hollowed his cheeks and bagged his eyes . Even the marks of wear and tear were n't ugly , though . They gave his face more character , made him seem like a guy who 'd seen hard times , and could sympathize with your own suffering . His dark suit fit his frame perfectly , and his eyes twinkled , bags or not . Jason could have been a politician . He was n't . <br> " You still on the grift ? " Marla asked . <br> He raised one eyebrow . " Me ? A grifter ? Heavens , no . I 'm a legitimate businessperson now . Just like you . Nice nightclub , by the way . " He sat down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She glanced at her friend and associate Rondeau , who had opened the door for Jason and now watched them with undisguised fascination . " It 's his club , not mine . " <br> Jason raised his hands and smiled , a smile that said , " We 're all in this together , " a smile that had emptied many a wallet and opened many a bedroom door . " No need to be coy with me , sis . I 'm not from the IRS . " <br> Marla rubbed her eyes . She 'd had a long day  --  actually , a long summer  --  and this was too much . She 'd rather face the literal vengeful ghosts of her enemies again than confront this haunt from her past . " I know it 's not in your nature to cut the bullshit , Jason , but , really , why are you here ? Do you need money or something ? " <br> " Money 's always welcome , of course , but I 'm not interested in charity . I heard you were here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I actually have a business proposition for you . " He glanced at Rondeau . " One best discussed in private . " <br> " It 's a bad idea to do business with family , " Marla said . " It 's a sure path to heartbreak . If that 's all you wanted , I 'll pass . " <br> " Now , that 's not the Marla I know and love . You were always curious , sis . Do n't you want to know what I have to offer ? It 'll tempt and tantalize , I promise . " <br> " I 'm not sure what you know  --  what you think you know  --  about my business , but my situation here is complex , and I 've got a full plate already . I said I 'll pass . " <br> " Marla  --  " <br> She held up her hand . " Jason , you 're my brother , and that gets you a lot of slack , but keep pushing , and I 'll have to push back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You always did know your own mind , so I wo n't try to change it . I 've got a hotel room , and I 'm here for a few days at least , depending on how my business goes . Do n't suppose you could spare an hour for dinner tomorrow ? Or lunch , if being your long-lost brother does n't entitle me to a whole dinner ? " <br> " Fine . Dinner . Come by tomorrow around six , we 'll figure something out . " <br> He stood up , started to go , paused , turned back to her . " Hey . Sister . I did n't come to make trouble for you , I promise . " <br> " Yeah ? " She wanted to believe him , but Jason . . . she had n't seen him since she was a teenager , and it was hard to forget those old bad memories . Hard to believe he 'd changed . On the other hand , she 'd changed , rather a lot , so maybe she was being unfair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and figured I 'd look you up , see if I could interest you in a certain opportunity that 's come my way . Sometimes I think back . . . . Remember when it was you and me against the world ? " <br> Marla felt her throat begin to close . " That was a long time ago , Jason . " <br> " Formative years . " He nodded farewell . <br> Marla dropped into her chair . <br> " That 's your brother ? " Rondeau handed her a glass of water . Sometimes it was good to have a friend who knew you that well . <br> She took a long drink , glad for the excuse it gave her to delay answering . When she spoke , she felt more in control . " Yes , he is . What tipped you off ? The bit where he called me his sister ? " <br> Rondeau sat down across from her , in the chair Jason had recently vacated , and whistled . " Damn . I knew you had a brother , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " <br> " I kind of figured he was one or the other of those myself . " <br> " You seem a little shaken up . You all right ? " <br> " Sure . My brother the con man shows up unannounced after nearly twenty years , talking about a ' business proposition ' ? I 'm great . If it were anybody else coming at me with this crap , I 'd just throw them out , but he 's family . What am I supposed to do ? " <br> " Do n't ask me , " Rondeau said . " I 'm an orphan . This shit is a mystery to me . " He paused . " It 's not like you do n't have any choice , though . If you really want to get rid of him , you are a sorcerer . You can make him forget he even saw you today . " <br> Marla fiddled with the scythe-shaped letter opener on her desk and sighed . " Maybe it 'll come to that . But I owe him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just him and me and Mom and whatever asshole guy followed Mom home from the bar on any given night . Jason kept a lot of bad things from happening to me . " <br> " He 's a scam artist , huh ? " <br> " Just small-time stuff when we were younger . Hustling pool , short counting , three card monte , convincing drunks to make unwinnable bar bets , selling fake football picks , shit like that . By his freshman year in high school he was so well known in the county that nobody would even play rock-paper-scissors with him , and he 'd take weekend trips to Indianapolis to make money . But that was ages ago . Maybe he 's reformed . " <br> " Or maybe he 's moved on to bigger and better scams . Did you see his suit ? It was a nice suit . I know from nice suits . " Rondeau plucked the lapels of his vintage green tuxedo jacket , worn over a T-shirt depicting a skeletal rib cage . " He did n't buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " Would n't surprise me . He was always ambitious . " Among other things . <br> " So . . . is there a reason you have n't talked to him in all these years , or do you just object to his moral flexibility ? " Rondeau did n't even bother to make the last bit sound sarcastic . Marla was a sorcerer . Sorcerers were the very definition of moral flexibility . <br> " We had a . . . falling out . Or more like the scales falling from my eyes , and my seeing Jason for what he is . Or was . I do n't want to talk about it . " <br> " Sometimes people do change , Marla . You 're not the person you were even ten years ago . " He rubbed his jaw absently , and Marla felt the old twinge of guilt  --  years ago she 'd ripped Rondeau 's jaw off to use as an oracle , and though he 'd been healed by magic and she 'd made amends countless times , she still hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about you ? What you really do ? With the sorcery and so forth ? " <br> " I certainly hope not . I 'd rather keep it that way . " <br> " So no telling him you 're the witch queen of Felport ? Or that I 'm not so much a human as a psychic parasite squatting in a human body ? Or that  --  " <br> " Correct , nix on all that , Rondeau . Ideally you 'll never see him again , so you wo n't even be tempted to blather things you should n't . " <br> " Another Mason . " Rondeau shook his head . " Damn . That 's something . " <br> " I do n't even want to think about Jason right now . I 'm going to go home and crawl under the covers and grind my teeth . " <br> " Still want me to pick you up tomorrow morning so we can go to the airport ? " <br> " Sure . But no staying up all night gambling on the Internet tonight , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we 're going to have a busy-ass day , so you 'll need to be well rested . " <br> He said , " You 're the boss , " but Marla could tell he was already playing Texas hold ' em in his mind . She 'd have to make sure Rondeau did n't spend too much time around her brother , or Jason would eventually invite him to a card game and end up owning all Rondeau 's worldly possessions . <br> Unless , of course , her brother had changed  --  or , rather , changed back  --  into the brother she 'd once loved and trusted . It was a tempting thought , and because she found it so tempting , she did her best to doubt it . <br> Marla watched the thin trickle of exhausted businessmen and bereaved relatives emerge from the jetway of the red-eye from San Francisco , dragging their rolling suitcases behind them like Jacob Marley 's chains . When Bradley Bowman emerged toting a duffel bag , he was so wide-eyed and awake he seemed scarcely the same species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounded toward her , dropping his bag at her feet and giving her a hug . <br> " Hey , B. " She could n't get over it  --  this scruffily cute , charismatic ex-movie star had flown across the continent to work for her . She was supposed to teach him how to use his peculiar magics , even though his natural gifts were as a seer and a psychic , while Marla herself was about as psychic as an axe handle and specialized in kicking the shit out of people , things , and ideas . But B was good people . They 'd find a way to make it work . Her operation could use some charm and diplomacy to go along with the scorched earth and hurt feelings . <br> B let go of her , but kept beaming . " How 'd you get in here ? I thought security stopped people from meeting their friends at the gate these days . " <br> " B , please . This is me . Airport security is something that happens to other people . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " Waiting with the car . Last time I let him sneak in here , he made his way to the baggage-loading area and started rifling through suitcases . After that , I revoked his conditional invisibility privileges . Come on , we 'd better go to the car before he gets bored and wanders off . " <br> " God , it 's great to be here . " He followed Marla through the terminal . " Do n't get me wrong , being Sanford Cole 's apprentice was an honor , and he taught me a lot , but these past few months . . . " <br> " Eh , he 's an old guy . He ca n't help it if he has magical narcolepsy . Besides , after a week of working for me , you 'll wish I dropped off to sleep at random intervals every once in a while , just so you could get some rest . " They left the secure area , Marla giving a little wave to the security agent , who still could n't see her . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm here to learn , and I do n't mind cutting wood and carrying water . " <br> " Better than Rondeau . " Marla passed through the automatic doors , out to the summer morning , which was already heating up . " He just cuts farts and carries debt . " <br> " Movie star ! " Rondeau crowed , popping upright from his lean against the Bentley 's fender . " Welcome to Felport , where we hardly ever get earthquakes , mud slides , and wildfires ! " <br> " Blizzards and ice storms will be a nice change , " B said . <br> Marla let them hug their hellos  --  the two of them had become quite close during a trip to San Francisco a few months back . She waited for Rondeau to toss B 's bag into the car 's cavernous trunk before saying , " I 'll ride in back with you , B. I need to ask you something , and I do n't want to have to twist around to see you . " <br> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rondeau grumbled , and they all climbed into the car . As Rondeau navigated around dawdling shuttle buses , suicidal cabs , and bleary pedestrians , Marla said , " So are you wiped out ? Need to grab some sack time ? " <br> " No , I 'm totally wired , and anyway , the plane was nearly empty , I had a whole row to myself , so I slept plenty . Do n't worry about me . " <br> " Good . We 've got a busy schedule ahead of us . You 're no good to me if you do n't know the major players in the local scene , so in the next few days , we 're going to be visiting a lot of scary , dangerous weirdos and making nice with them . " <br> " Sounds good . But what do you really want to talk to me about ? " <br> Marla grunted . " You being psychic now ? " <br> " Not at the moment . You know I 'm lousy at straight thought reading  --  it gives me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your mind . " <br> " Well , I was just wondering . . . . Have you had any dreams lately ? About me ? Any of those dreams ? " <br> B shook his head . " Nope , no prophetic dreams about you , not since your last trip to California . Why ? " <br> " I had . . . an unexpected visitor last night . I 'm wondering if he 's going to make trouble . " <br> " What kind of visitor ? Demon king ? Dark sorcerer ? Eldritch being from beyond the back of the stars ? " <br> Continues ...
