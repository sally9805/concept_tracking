<p> There are signs of faith and prayer everywhere you look in sports these days . <p> The huddle of players kneeling in prayer on the field after every NFL game . Basketball players making the sign of the cross before shooting a free throw . Fingers pointed toward the sky after home runs and touchdowns . Signs for chapel services in baseball clubhouses . Bible study and Christian fellowship groups at high school and college campuses across the country . <p> " I do n't think a relationship with the Lord only occurs in church or only in your own private lives , " says Washington basketball coach Lorenzo Romar . " Every moment you walk , you want to live in such a manner that you are acknowledging God 's presence . You 're trying to be his advocate , his ambassador . I do n't think we turn it on and off . " <p> But not everyone is comfortable inviting God into the game . Five years after the Supreme Court reaffirmed a ban on officially sponsored prayer in public schools with a ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football games , the question of who can pray together - and how - is far from settled . <p> A New Jersey high school football coach filed suit against his district two weeks ago , asking for the right to pray with his team before games . Marcus Borden had prayed with his East Brunswick players for years until some parents complained this fall and he was ordered to stop . <p> The family of a former New Mexico State football player plans to file a federal suit , claiming he was discriminated against because he 's Muslim . MuAmmar Ali says he was criticized for reciting a prayer from the Quran instead of the " Our Father " the rest of the team was saying after practice , and was questioned about al-Qaida . <p> Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry was told last year to remove a banner from the locker room that displayed the " Competitor 's Creed , " including the lines , " I am a Christian first and last ... I am a member of Team Jesus Christ . " <p> " A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mainly , that we have pluralism , " says Richard Garnett , a professor of constitutional law at Notre Dame . " We are committed to two different values , government neutrality and the freedom of speech . I would n't want to give up one for the other . " <p> Once size does n't fit all <p> But trying to find a middle ground is difficult , and sometimes painful . <p> Mustafa Ali , MuAmmar Ali 's father , used to think society could use more prayer in public arenas . He and some of his co-workers have moments of prayer at work , and neither he nor his son objected when the Aggies ended practice with a prayer . But MuAmmar says he was criticized when he and two other Muslim players held their hands up to their faces and recited the opening chapter of the Quran . <p> MuAmmar Ali says coach Hal Mumme later called him into his office to ask about al-Qaida . Ali , the team 's leading rusher last year , lost his starting job after the season opener and was later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by New Mexico State to investigate a grievance filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on Ali 's behalf said it found no evidence of religious discrimination . But Ali 's father says the family plans to pursue its complaint in a federal suit . A call to New Mexico State was not immediately returned . <p> " I think prayer is good . I 'm actually for more of it , to be honest , " Mustafa Ali says . " But I also think in these situations , the person should be able to pray how they want to pray . When you have a prayer that is a set prayer , then you alienate others and make them feel uncomfortable . It is n't as simple as people think it is . " <p> Faith goes to school <p> The separation of church and state does n't prevent public school students from praying while they 're at school or participating in school-sponsored activities such as athletics . Equal-access laws have cleared the way for student-led religious groups , as long as they 're voluntary . <p> The Fellowship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high schools and colleges throughout the country , reaching 350,000 student-athletes , says Dan Britton , FCA 's senior vice president of ministry programs . Eighty percent of the groups are in high schools . <p> Problems arise when an authority figure such as a coach , or the school itself , is involved . In a 2000 ruling that banned students from leading pregame prayers over loudspeakers , the Supreme Court said the Santa Fe , Texas , school district was giving the impression of sponsorship . Students were using school equipment and were under the direction of a faculty member . <p> " The degree of school involvement makes it clear that the pregame prayers bear the imprint of the state and thus put school-age children who objected in an untenable position , " Justice John Paul Stevens wrote . <p> " I do n't know how a student says no , " says Anthony Griffin , the attorney who represented the two families who brought the Santa Fe case . " If I 'm an athlete and I want to play football , why should I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to do this . ' Then you 're not a team player . <p> " In team sports there 's tremendous pressure to conform , " Griffin says . " Having the coach lead the prayer session or encourage the prayer session is nothing more than coercion . " <p> But the Santa Fe decision has n't stopped coaches from praying with their teams . Grant Teaff , executive director of the American Football Coaches Association , says more than half of the nation 's high school football coaches engage in some form of team prayer . <p> The battle now is to define that fine line between participating and proselytizing . <p> Borden , the East Brunswick ( N.J. ) High School coach , resigned Oct. 7 after being told he could n't pray with his players or even be present at their pregame prayers . He returned a week later after hiring a lawyer . <p> Keeping it voluntary <p> Romar 's players have voluntary Bible study , and the coach prays with them before games . But both are done at the players ' initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the pregame prayers at first . <p> " I stumbled across it because I went out of the locker room quicker than usual ( one night ) , " Romar says . " I said if that 's the case , I want to be a part of it . " <p> And if somebody does n't want to participate ? <p> " Perfectly fine , " Romar says . " That 's why it 's not mandatory . " <p> While teams such as Romar 's seem to have found a balance , the struggle for others will continue regardless of how many lawsuits or complaints are filed . The separation of church and state is a bedrock of American society , but so , too , is the presence of faith . This is a country where " In God We Trust " is printed on coins and dollar bills . <p> " We 've always had this middle ground between established church and an entirely secular public life , " says Garnett , the Notre Dame law professor . " The only way to really eliminate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would n't want that to happen . <p> " A society that has no lawsuits , you wonder what 's going on . " DOUG BENC : GETTY IMAGES
