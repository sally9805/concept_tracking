DENNY HEARD THE MUFFLED whacking of the chopper blades and the motor 's deep roar , but he was underground and almost upside down , working by flashlight to detach a fuzzy bear cub from a dangerous nipple , and could n't have dropped everything to scamper obediently back along the ridge trail right that minute even if he 'd wanted to . Which , frankly , he did n't . <p> The cub let go , rasping a complaint . Denny backpedaled on his elbows out of the black cavern - and out of immediate range of the huge , rank , snoring heap of mother bear who had given birth to this baby in her sleep - holding the little cub off the ground in his gloved right hand . As usual he scraped his stomach . Being short and scrawny was an advantage in his line of work , but this maneuver was n't easy even for him . <p> Out in the pale winter daylight , he knelt in a pile of oak leaves to dump the baby gently into the pan of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . Pulling off his right glove with his teeth , he recorded the weight , 1.3 kilos , on a PocketPad , drew a blood sample , and stapled an ear tag into the now-squawling baby 's left ear - left for male . " Sorry , Rocket . Sorry , little guy . " <p> His movements were neat and practiced , and he was also hurrying . It was always best to reduce stress on the infant bears by being quick , but today Denny had a couple of extra reasons for hurrying . The winter , like most winters nowadays , was mild . Too mild . Denny had waited for the coldest weather he could , but the mother bear might not be all that deeply asleep . The other reason , of course , was that he could n't hear the helicopter any more , meaning that it had landed and that the Hefn Observer would be at the cabin by now , probably pacing back and forth on the deck , increasingly irritated as Denny continued to fail to show up . Punctuality mattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Innisfrey , the Observer for Wildlife Habitat Recovery - had never been late for a rendezvous . <p> Denny wiggled his hand back into its gauntlet , picked up the cub , and wormed his way back into the den . His body almost completely blocked what little light seeped through the entrance , but he 'd left the flashlight just inside , and so could see where to press the cub against his mother 's chest until he started to suckle . The other baby turned loose more cooperatively ; but as it did so the mother bear made a harsh sound deep in her throat and moved her massive shoulder . Denny froze , his heart leaping into his own throat , the purloined cub complaining and squirming in the leather gauntlet . But it was okay , she settled down again , so he backed the rest of the way out and sat puffing until his pulse rate returned to normal . He had always been against tranquilizing the mothers for the cubs ' first couple of physicals - the sedative got into their milk and affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously if it might n't be a good idea to reevaluate that policy in the light of how the animals were being affected by the warming climate . <p> Or maybe reevaluate Fish and Wildlife 's whole approach to black bear management . At least in rural areas like this one , that the bears had been quick to recolonize as the aging , dwindling human population had abandoned their fields and pastures and moved into the towns , where there were services and the roads were maintained . Not even a wagon and team could get around very well over roads as bad as the ones around here had gotten to be , all potholes and big broken chunks of macadam . Even plain dirt would be better . Denny himself rode a horse ( Rocinante ) and led a pack mule ( Roscoe ) when he went into town for provisions . he was n't much of a rider , but then he did n't have much of a choice . <p> The second cub was a female . " Rodeo , " Denny told her , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilos she was slightly chubbier than her brother . Rodeo 's " real " name was Number 439 , the number on her tag . She was half of the third pair of cubs produced by Number 117 , the sow presently enjoying her long winter 's nap down in the den , a huge healthy animal and an excellent mother ; all but one of her cubs had survived to adulthood . She was six years old , the one hundred seventeenth female to be radio-collared in the state of Kentucky since the Hefn had established the management program , and her " call name " was Rosetta . Like hurricanes , study bears were call-named by cycling through the letters of the alphabet . Cubs kept the first two letters of their mother 's name through subsequent generations , which allowed each initial to be used many times . If by some chance all the children and children 's children of a particular bear should die , the pair of letters would not be retired but would go back into service , available for use by the next young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Virginia . To change state of residence was to become part of a different study and get a whole new identity . <p> Rosetta had n't done that ; she was a Kentuckian born and bred , like Denny himself , though ( also like Denny ) she had wandered about for a good while before settling down in Denny 's district and digging herself this excellent den under a huge oak blown over in a tornado . He had n't named her or her first pair of cubs , who 'd still been traveling with her when she 'd moved into the county . But he 'd named the next pair ( Rocannon and Rotorooter ) , and was keeping a whole list of Ro- names in reserve . <p> Rodeo , having protestingly donated some blood and acquired a numbered ear tag of her own , resumed suckling the instant Denny put her back on the nipple , and this time her mother did n't stir . Rosetta 's collar appeared to be in decent shape and was still sending a good clear signal . Denny made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exited the den . He poked his syringes and test tubes into the fingers of the gauntlets and stuffed them into his daypack , along with the scales and PocketPad and flashlight , and headed for the cabin at once , walking briskly , shrugging on the pack . The air was pretty cold , a little below freezing ; he fished a watch cap out of his jacket pocket to pull down over his bald spot and his ears , and jammed his hands into his pockets . <p> Now that he was done with the bears , he looked at his watch and shifted mental gears . The Hefn Observer had been kept waiting for nearly an hour . Denny walked faster , almost jogging , a short wiry man with an anxious , rather ferretty face . The view from the ridge through gaps in the cedars , folded hills dusted over with snow under a pale sky , was lovely in its bareness , but Denny had scant attention to spare for it this day . Hurrying past the viewpoint with the nicest prospect without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedar trees lining the sides of what had once been a wagon road . <p> The Hefn had ordered field studies of bears , coyotes , elk , and white-tailed deer in the eastern United States , it was their initiative ; they were monitoring the ecological health of the planet by monitoring its apex predators and their prey species as these reclaimed or moved into habitat that year by year was returning to a wild state . But funding for Denny 's particular field study in Anderson County depended on satisfying the Hefn Observer to whom he reported , and failing to pay this fact due notice ( by being dilatory ) was not good politics . Denny had been on the job since the beginning of the project , and knew he was very good at what he did , but you still had to kowtow on a regular basis to the goddamned Hefn . He basically hated the Hefn , something he had in common with just about everybody else in the world . Answering to them was the disagreeable part of the bear study . <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in human history to be a human being , but it was also , he had to acknowledge it , one of the best to be a wildlife biologist in your own back yard . If it were n't for the Hefn , and their Directive , and the Baby Ban Broadcast that had sterilized just about every person on the planet , there would be no black bear population in east central Kentucky - or elk population , or population of coyotes approaching the size of wolves , all busily subspeciating in the fascinating ways they were doing . Without the Hefn Takeover , east central Kentucky - now a recovering climax oak-hickory forest - would still be growing tobacco and Black Angus steers , and spindling big round bales of tall-fescue hay . The state 's black bears would still be in the Daniel Boone National Forest on the West Virginia border , way over in the Appalachian foothills , with far too few bears to go around for the numbers of local people eager to study them . <p> Denny really loved his work . Except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did about human babies , but he despised the Hefn anyhow . The problem did n't get simpler . Mostly he just accepted the way things were and focused on his job , but every time he had to show up for one of these meetings the conflict would boil up inside him again . <p> The ragged alley of tall cedars ended abruptly and he emerged into the clearing where the cabin sat . Beyond it hulked the chopper , a big metal dragonfly . Neither the Hefn nor the chopper pilot , a human , were anywhere to be seen . Denny trotted up the steps and along the deck and pushed open the cabin door . <p> A young woman in her mid-twenties or thereabouts was hunkered down in front of the stove , putting in chunks of firewood ; she closed and latched the little door and stood to face him , dusting off her hands . " Hi , " said Denny . " I guess I 'm a little late . I was vetting some new cubs and kind of got into a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke he stuffed the watch cap in his pocket and hung the backpack on a hook by the door . <p> " He went for a walk . He was getting sleepy , " she said . " It 's not Innisfrey this time , it 's Humphrey . I 'm Marian Hoffman , by the way . " <p> " The pilot , right ? " She nodded . " Denny Demaree . " They shook hands . Denny started to unzip his parka , then had a thought . " Uh - maybe I should go try to find him ? Did he walk down to the road ? " <p> " He just went straight past the pond and on down the hill . Bushwhacking . On all fours , the last I saw of him . I guess he does n't get out of the city much . " <p> Denny considered . If the Hefn had n't stuck to either of the farm 's rough wagon roads , he could be anywhere . " Then I guess I 'll wait . " He hung his jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marian took the other . The next instant he sprang out of the chair . " Hang on , did you say Humphrey ! The Bureau of Temporal Physics and the Apprentices and all that - the one that does the viddy program ? What the hell is he doing here ? " <p> " Do n't ask me , I just fly the chopper . " She smiled . " Nice little place you 've got here . Pretty luxurious for a field office . " <p> " I - " Denny stopped and willed himself to calm down . Humphrey . He had a bad feeling about this , but there was nothing to do but wait for the Hefn to show up . He sat down again . " Yeah , it is nice . Some old lady built this cabin and willed it and the whole farm to the local Girl Scout Council for a camp . The actual farm is a hundred acres , and a long time ago it used to be in my family , with a house down by the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin , was used as an admin building when the Scouts had it . " <p> " Then time went by , and there were n't any more Brownies coming up through the ranks ? " <p> He nodded . " The Scouts turned the place over to the state when they disbanded , and the state turned it over to Fish and Wildlife when the Hefn tapped them to monitor wildlife recovery . " He hopped up again , nervously . " I feel like I should n't just be sitting around . " <p> " Humphrey 's not like Innisfrey , " Marian said . " He wo n't jump all over you for not being here on time . At least I do n't think he will . " <p> " Yeah , but why 's he here ? " Denny said . He opened the door to the porch and walked outside , scanning the whole long view from left to right . Nothing . <p> " ' Sister Anne , Sister Anne , do you see anyone coming ? ' " Marian called to him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigued . The line , which he recognized but had n't thought of in decades , was from a kids ' edition of Grimm 's Fairy Tales . Kids ' edition or not , the story had given him nightmares . From deep within itself his memory obliged with the right response : " ' Naught but the wind a-blowing , naught but the green grass growing . ' Man , I ca n't believe I still remember that ! I reckon it must 've been high summer in Bluebeard 's kingdom , the grass wo n't green up here for a good while yet . " <p> " But here is Bluebeard himself , " came a deep voice from the deck , and the Hefn Humphrey burst through the other door and swept into the room . <p> Denny bolted to the porch doorway just in time to catch the Hefn 's showy entrance . He darted inside while Humphrey shut the other door and turned to greet him properly . " You were expecting my colleague Innisfrey . I am , as you see , not Innisfrey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I offered to take this meeting in his place , as I was already in Kentucky for a reason of my own . Humphrey , BTP . I am pleased to meet you , George Dennis Demaree . " <p> Denny stared , more or less dumbfounded . He had of course seen Humphrey on the viddy , doing regular progress reports and updates and announcements . Also scoldings . Humphrey was the highest-profile Observer of the lot , and had had the most to do with humans since the Takeover , but the image on the screen , to which he had paid as little attention as possible , had not prepared Denny for the force of Humphrey 's personality . He looked like Innisfrey , his short , stocky , oddly jointed figure , covered entirely with gray hair ( including a long shaggy beard which , though gray like the rest of him , made his improvised witticism particularly apt ) , with large opaque eyes and forked hands and feet . He also looked , truth to tell , rather moth-eaten . Denny knew why ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter made their hair fall out in clumps . And he had Innisfrey 's faintly gamy wet-dog odor . <p> But the quality of his presence was n't remotely like cold , supercilious , charmless Innisfrey 's . All in all , the clash between apprehensive expectation and reality was so disorienting that it took Denny almost a minute to pull his wits together enough to apologize for being late . <p> " Not at all , not at all . Your tardiness providentially provided me with a chance to stretch my legs . The country hereabouts is delightful ; your work here must have given you great pleasure . " <p> Denny nodded ; then , realizing that he and his visitor were both still standing , blurted , " Uh , would you like to sit down ? " <p> Humphrey said , " As it appears that we have two chairs and two humans and one Hefn in this room , I propose that you and Marian Hoffman take the chairs . " And thereupon the Hefn Humphrey , household word , movie star , viddy personality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ambled over to the woodstove , and flomped onto the rag rug . He looked like a scruffy , off-color Great Pyrenees . " All right , Marian Hoffman ? All right , George Dennis Demaree ? " He gazed mildly from one to the other with those odd flat eyes , and Denny found himself in danger of being seriously disarmed . <p> Marian had stood when Humphrey came in . She and Denny looked at each other , and then both sat down in the chairs they had been sitting in before . <p> " Now , to business ! I am delighted to be the bearer of happy tidings , " Humphrey said , and the flat eyes somehow conveyed an impression of beaming with pleasure . " Innisfrey has , as you might say , filled me in , and I have examined the radio reports you have filed , and the written reports , all of them , for the entire duration of this study . You have done excellent work here ! Thanks to you , and to the studies of coyotes and white-tailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a complete and detailed picture of the top two predators for this recovering habitat , together with their most important large prey species , over the past four years . <p> " During this period in this area , the black bear population has experienced a seventy-four percent gain in numbers . Eighty-six percent of the bears are not immigrants but bears native to east central Kentucky . Remarkable ! More than that , the bears are , might one say , in the pink ? A comical expression to apply to a dark-colored bear ! Their reproductive success has been excellent , and they are in prime condition ! As the flora here proceed through the various stages of succession , the entire ecosystem burgeons and thrives . <p> " Therefore ! With no reason whatever for concern that the trend is in danger of reversing itself , we have determined , " Humphrey said from his shaggy-sheepdog position on the floor , giving again that impression of beaming up into Denny 's face , " to terminate this study , and to reassign you , George Dennis Demaree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have exercised so diligently in this one . Congratulations ! " And he bounded up and offered Denny his forked , hairy hand . <p> Denny bounded up as well . " But the study 's not finished ! " he protested , his voice loud and rude with shock . Instead of shaking Humphrey 's hand , he waved his arms wildly . " It 's nowhere near finished ! I designed it to run for ten years , that 's the way my data spreadsheets are configured - I do n't want to drop it now ! I ca n't ! I ca n't believe you want to pull me out now ! " <p> At Denny 's outburst the Hefn 's beamish-boy look faded away ; his demeanor became more closed and quiet , and when he spoke his voice had lost much of its hearty charm . " I regret that you do not wish to end your work here . I regret to learn that in your view it is incomplete . Our view , however , is different . We consider you to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this area is well on its way to climax . Also thanks to you , we know that biodiversity increases every year . This is all we need to know . Whether you choose to accept reassignment is , of course , a decision you must make for yourself , but there are a great many other recovering habitat areas in Kentucky about which we know too little , and where your skills would be of great service . " <p> Denny , so angry he was almost sputtering , managed to let him finish . " It does n't work like that ! " he blurted the instant Humphrey stopped talking . " Wildlife biology is important for its own sake ! Understanding how the bears adapt as this farmland reverts to climax forest does n't end because some practical purpose has been served ! You - you Hefn never told me you 'd turn up one day and tell me to pack up my stuff and leave ! I did everything you told me to , nobody ever complained that the work was n't done well - you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Marian moved uneasily in her chair , and Denny suddenly remembered , like a bucket of cold water , who he was talking to . The Hefn , as he knew perfectly well , could do whatever they damn pleased . They had absolute power over the people of Earth , and most Hefn felt no sympathy for humanity , given the mess humanity had made of its own planet , and how hard the aliens had had to work to get them to clean it up . This Hefn , Humphrey , was probably the one with the most sympathy for the plight of the Earth 's people , many of whom were suffering a good deal from the cleanup process . If he said the study was over , it was probably over . <p> Denny was wild . What a fool he 'd been , to fall into the comfy habit of assuming he 'd been assigned to this field study for the sake of science , and that as long as he minded his P 's and Q 's he would be allowed to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hefn to study the bears of east central Kentucky for a while . Now they were done doing that , evidently , and he could take a new assignment or go and do something else entirely , they did n't much care which . What they would not let him do was the one thing he wanted to do : keep on living in this cabin , watching Rocket and Rodeo develop under the tutelage of Rosetta , recording their weight , examining their scats under a microscope , radio-collaring them in due course , observing as they found mates and began the next generation . <p> Then he had another thought . " What about Jason and Angie , are you pulling them out too ? " <p> " The studies of Jason Gotschalk and Angela Rivera are integral with your own . The coyotes are thriving . The white-tailed deer are thriving . The elk are thriving . Everything is thriving ! We would not allow any element of this area study to continue unless all were to continue , nor would we terminate one without terminating all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would think he was doing them all a favor by yanking them out of the field . <p> Denny had one more card to play , so he played it , not expecting to gain much by it but needing to try . " I 'm a Gaian , " he said . " This is my Ground . A hundred years ago my family owned this farm , and I 'd like to stay here , even if the study is n't to be funded anymore . " Stay and do a little unofficial-work with Rosetta and her family and the half-dozen other breeding sows he 'd been following , until the equipment wore out . Or , if they took that all away to a different site , just record observations , do odd jobs in town to buy food , hunker down here for as long as he could . <p> Humphrey immediately became less alien-seeming , but no less definite . " Then I am truly sorry , " he said , sounding as if he meant it . " But alas , no one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat studies have been terminated , the human presence shall be excluded until recovery is complete . " <p> The Gafr were the boss aliens that nobody had ever seen . They directed things from their ship parked on the Moon , and what they said was final . <p> " When ? " Denny asked , finally defeated . <p> " We will help you gather your personal things together , " said Humphrey kindly . <p> He meant they were going to fly him out now . " What about the horse and the mule ? " <p> " They will be transferred to another field station . Yours , if you decide to accept reassignment . And I will gladly put you in touch with the Gaian Steward in Louisville , who should be able to assist you in finding another suitable Ground . Very possibly a way might be devised to match your new assignment with such a place . " <p> And kick me out again when you decided I 'd done enough there , Denny thought . No thanks . <p> " As a Gaian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurt Hollow ? Would that interest you ? Bears have been sighted nearby . Pam Pruitt is in residence there at present , but some arrangement could surely be worked out . " <p> Denny glanced up at this , but his mind was in turmoil , " I ... do n't know . I need to think . " He gazed around the cabin , the place he had gradually let himself come to think of as home for the foreseeable future , now on the far side of an absolute divide ; it was like looking through a Time Window into the past . " Most of this stuff stays with the cabin . The dishes and bedding and all that . The short-wave set . " <p> " We will help you gather up what does not , yes , Marian Huffman ? " <p> " I 'd rather do it myself . I wo n't be long . You could damp down the stove if you want something to do . " <p> There really was n't much to pack : some dirty laundry , a razor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and computer disks , the PocketPad , the laptop , his field glasses , his other pair of boots . Denny threw it all on the bed and went down in the basement , mind reeling from the sudden shift of direction , to get his duffel bag . <p> Under the stairs , piled in the doorless tornado shelter , were the abandoned remnants of the old farm 's incarnation as Camp Sheltowee : rolled-up sleeping bags , tents , deflated air mattresses , mess kits , canteens .... Denny 's disoriented brain suddenly focused . He touched nothing , only stood still for a moment before heading back up with the empty duffel . But his mind was made up . <p> The chopper dropped him at the regional headquarters of Fish and Wildlife in Frankfort and whirled off to collect his two still-unsuspecting colleagues . Tess Perry , Denny 's boss , threw up her arms in protest at his accusing glare . " We had absolutely no clue they were going to pull this ! The first I knew about it , here was Humphrey instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to reassign three field researchers , they were closing down East Central . This office is being closed down ! I tried to warn you and the other two but you 'd all gone out . " <p> " I was checking on Rosetta 's cubs , " he said bitterly . " So what happens now ? " <p> " Reassignment , like he said . " And at the look on Denny 's face , " I know , I know , believe me , but you need to think about it anyway before you burn any bridges . When they get back here with Angie and Jason they 're taking y'all to Louisville . " She pronounced it " Luh:uv'le . " " They 're giving me a week to close up the office , then guess where I 'm being transferred to . Paducah ! Think I want to go to Paducah ? " <p> " Your parents live here in Frankfort , do n't they ? " <p> " My whole goddam family lives in Frankfort ! But I 'm going to Paducah , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and till I come up with one I 'm keeping on the right side of the Hefn . " <p> Denny groaned . " God , I hate the fuckers . " <p> " Not any more than I do , " said Tess glumly , " but if you want to keep on doing wildlife biology , stay on their good side , that 's all I 'm saying . " <p> DENNY SAID NOTHING to any of them about his plan , not Tess , not his rumpled and furious fellow deportees . In Louisville he went through the motions of being debriefed and counseled about reassignment , took a couple of days to " think it over , " discussing options with Angie and Jason and the teams from the eastern part of the state , who had also been praised to the skies and yanked out of the field . <p> In the end , after a lot of grumbling , the others all agreed to be posted elsewhere , at least for the time being . Humphrey must indeed have put in a word , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gaian shrine thirty miles upriver . He thanked them politely but said he 'd like to apply for an unpaid leave , take some time to consider all his options , including that one , which he hinted was an attractive possibility . Unlike the others , the territory he 'd been relieved from was his Ground ; that made it harder to know what to do . He mentioned visiting his brother in Pittsburgh ; you could get to Pittsburgh by steamboat , right up the Ohio River from Louisville . <p> The interviewing officer was sympathetic ; he too was a Gaian , an early convert who had also chosen family property as his Ground , and could appreciate what a blow it must be for Denny to lose his study area and be forced off the farm . Talking about the Hefn and their imperious ways , his face got very tight . He encouraged Denny to think about Hurt Hollow ; they needed someone there and it would be good if the someone were a Gaian , who would appreciate the place 's historic significance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cleaned up , with a new haircut and his duffel full of clean clothes , boarded the boat and stood at the railing as it steamed upriver ( passing legendary Hurt Hollow , which showed no sign of anyone being in residence ) , calling at Madison and Milton , Benny 's home town , and finally at Carrollton , where the Kentucky River poured into the Ohio . <p> At Carrollton he left the boat , his scrawny , scruffy figure melting into the flow of disembarking passengers , and boarded a mule-hauled flatboat bound up the Kentucky for Frankfort and points south and east . He bought his ticket on board . It was dusk of the following day when he stepped off at the landing at Tyrone , under the railroad bridge that spanned the river from bluff to high bluff . <p> While waiting for full dark to fall , he converted his duffel into a backpack by adjusting some straps . It was good and bad that there was no Moon . In the blackness he slipped by side roads , now no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , and set off up the road he had traveled so many times on Rocinante 's back . He was heading for the cabin . <p> A mile west of Lawrenceburg he encountered a line of signposts , brand new , marching away from the road in both directions and forward along both margins . It was too dark to read the smaller print , but the word in large type at the top was WARNING ! He did n't need to read the rest , or wonder who had posted the warnings . By continuing along the road he was , in effect , entering a narrow corridor through a forbidden zone . Denny shrugged , made a face , and forged ahead . <p> That he knew the road from horseback as well as he did was a lucky thing ; the night was very dark , with a mean headwind , and the damaged black surface was hard to see . He found a stick to probe with and felt his way along the edge , cursing the need to go so slowly . <p> At four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream he called Part-Time Creek , which established the eastern boundary of the old farm , and probed his way in total blackness down into the bed of the creek . Its jumble of rocks was dry - no water or ice in the bed to make things worse - but inching upstream in the dark without falling was so close to impossible that more than an hour had passed before Denny felt he was far enough from the road to risk pushing up through a tangle of brush to flat land . <p> But he came out where he had intended to , behind the skeletal tobacco barn where the Scout camp 's maintenance equipment had been kept . Tobacco barns were built with spaces between the vertical boards , so the circulating air could cure the tobacco leaves hung in bunches from the rafters . The barn was therefore poor protection from the wind , and also listing badly . But Denny had stored Rocinante 's and Roscoe 's hay in the loft , and had nailed the saggy ladder tight to the uprights . He had gambled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gamble paid off . Working by memory and feel , avoiding the weak spots in the floor of the loft , he built a windbreak out of bales . He cut the twine from another bale to make a mattress , scratchy but fragrant , of loose hay ( carefully rolling up the cut pieces of twine and stuffing them in his pants pocket ) , then piled more hay over himself and his stuff and pulled his watch cap down over his ears and his parka hood up over that . By first light he was sound asleep . <p> Nothing woke him ; he woke himself , startled awake from a dream of crossing an endlessly broad , jaggedly tumbled polar ice floe in Arctic blackness . He was feeling his way with something like an ice axe lashed to the end of a ski pole , thinking This would make a good weapon if a polar bear comes along , when just then a polar bear did loom dazzlingly out of the darkness . But after a first thrill of fear , Denny realized that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Want a lift ? " it said . There was a fuzzy white cub on its back already , sitting up like a human child on a pony . " Sure , " said Denny , and he scrambled up on the bear 's back behind the cub . But then the bear began to gallop across the rough ice . There was nothing to hold onto except the cub , and Denny understood that he absolutely must not take the cub down with him . As he was jolted off its mother 's slippery back , he woke himself up yelling . <p> Fine , why not just go out and blow a trumpet blast to let everybody know where he was ? Fully awake and instantly aware of his situation , Denny swore silently as he pushed back the parka hood and watch cap , straining to hear anything that would suggest he 'd given himself away . But there was nothing , no sound at all , not even wind keening through the cracks between the slats . It was perfectly still . Nor could he see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day was overcast , chilly but not terribly cold . He looked at his watch : 3:46 . It would n't be dark enough to leave the barn for a couple more hours at least . After squirming around in the hay to try to go back to sleep , which proved impossible , he sat up cautiously and peered around . <p> The inside of the barn appeared exactly as he had last seen it . That probably meant that the Hefn had taken it for the derelict it was ; probably they had n't even opened the doors facing the road , which were stuck tight anyway , to peer inside . Roscoe 's tracks were around if you looked , but he and Rocinante had been stabled in the little shed near the cabin that housed the cistern and in former times the pump . <p> Denny passed the remaining hours of daylight eating a sandwich and a packet of craisins , checking his watch every couple of minutes , and going over and over the reasons why he was n't going to be caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty for disobeying a direct order from the Hefn . He knew what those signs said besides WARNING ! They said that persons caught willfully trespassing on posted land would have their memories erased . This was no idle threat , it happened every so often when frustration about the Baby Ban built up enough somewhere on the planet that people had to fight back , despite the failure and horrible punishment of everybody who had ever tried that - as far as Denny knew , every rebellion had failed completely . <p> Wiped transgressors were always displayed on international viddy . Denny had seen the bewildered , pitiful products of Hefn mindwipe on the screen and been horrified , like everyone else . He had never expected to risk that sort of treatment for himself - worse than execution in a way - and not until now had he understood why people were sometimes driven , despite the utter pointlessness of defying the Hefn , to defy them anyway . <p> When Denny had had plenty of time to drive himself bonkers , the light finally began to fade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made himself wait until six , and then with a sneeze of relief threw off the covering of hay . He emptied the duffelpack , piling his things at the top of the ladder , and put the pack on . Outside the barn he spent a couple of minutes brushing himself off and picking hay seeds and scratchy stalks out of his hair and collar . <p> His next move was to approach the cabin from the rear , to find out whether any Hefn were actually in residence . Hefn could see extremely well at night , and Humphrey had gone off scouting on his own without getting lost , that day he had thrown Denny off the farm . But Denny still felt confident that here in the open on his own Ground he enjoyed a certain advantage . <p> A wagon road ran alongside Part-Time Creek up the hollow ; he followed it cautiously for a little while , then struck left , straight uphill , scrambling , pulling himself along using saplings or going on all fours . He startled a little group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound away , making a lot of noise in the dry leaves . They could see what they were doing . He was making a lot of noise himself , but there was no help for it , he could n't see a thing . But he was n't lost ; all he had to do to get where he was going was keep heading straight uphill . When he felt he was far enough from the barn not to leave a sign for the once-predatory Hefn , he paused to pee into a tangle of blackberry canes . <p> After a while , puffing and sweating , he came to the edge of the woods and stopped to catch his breath . The hillside sloped more gently here . Directly ahead he could see the glint of the septic lagoon , and above that the pond ; and beyond the pond the cabin stood beneath bare trees on top of the ridge . Because he knew where to look , Denny could see its faint outline , blacker than the night sky . The place had a deserted feel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ready to bet that nobody , Hefn or human , waking or sleeping , was inside . There was also no helicopter parked on the site of the former garden . Breathing more easily , but still being careful , Denny climbed to the ridge , hugging the tree line . Where the driveway dipped out of sight of the cabin , he ducked across and slipped into the stable : empty . They had left the hay behind , but the horse and the mule had been evacuated . <p> His plan called for stealing a sleeping bag and tent from the stash in the basement - on this sortie or , if obstacles developed , a later one . There seemed no reason to wait . The lock on the patio door had rusted out long ago , so he did n't have to break in . He rummaged in the storm shelter with utmost stealth , but it felt more like a game of cops and robbers than anything truly dangerous . The cabin was empty ; intuitively he was certain of this . Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it went completely wild . Maybe the Hefn had such complete confidence in the deterrent power of their warning signs that they were n't going to bother checking to be sure everybody was in compliance . Maybe this was going to be easier than he had expected . <p> But that did n't allow for sloppiness . He knew it would take all his skill in camping and woodcraft to leave no trace of his presence for an overflying chopper to detect . <p> He found what he needed by feel . Besides the sleeping bag , pad , and tent , he took some cooking gear , a mess kit , a canteen , and a jerry can . That was all . He left everything else exactly as he 'd found it , trusting that a Hefn casting a casual eye around the basement would never notice that some of this castoff junk had disappeared . The aluminum cookware had canvas covers and did n't clank . He packed it all in the duffel and slipped out , closing the patio door with elaborate care , despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be his home . <p> Denny set up camp directly across the main road from the tobacco barn , on the north bank of Indian Creek . Working fast by pale dawn light , he pitched the pup tent in a small clearing ringed by the unkempt-looking red cedar trees that popped up in any patch of open ground hereabouts . From the road he would be invisible . <p> Maybe not from the air , however . He recklessly spent a hour of early daylight cutting cedar boughs and tying them to a makeshift exterior ridge pole with pieces of twine from the cut bales of hay , until the tent had a camouflage roof of cedar thatching . None of this could be accomplished in perfect silence , but he did his best . <p> Finally he crawled into the tent , inflated the pad , unzipped the sleeping bag , removed his boots and parka , and called it a day . Or a night . I 'd better get used to the nocturnal life , he told himself . Moving around much in the daytime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't be able to move around at all . Fire 's going to be a problem .... Listing these obstacles , he was n't sure how long he would be able to stick to his plan . But any more time at all with the bears was better than none , if he did n't get caught . <p> Night and day are about the same to a hibernating bear . The calculated risk he was running seemed very much worth it to Denny the next nightfall , as he stood outside Rosetta 's den , pulling on the leather gauntlets he had managed to sneak into his duffel - along with the other contents of his daypack , the scales and flashlight and PocketPad - almost under Humphrey 's nose , while he was being extradited . This day , the third since his arrival at the farm , had been cold , around twenty degrees F. He 'd huddled in his cocoon of down in the afternoon and thought out what he meant to do , then cut straight up from the road to the ridge top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood in the leaves tingling with exhilaration . He was here , despite everything that had been done to try to stop him . He would see the cubs again , weigh them , record the weights . Having no way to keep blood samples frozen till he could get them to a lab , he was n't going to draw any blood . But he would keep the other records as best he could , carry on the research a while longer . He felt he owed it to himself , and to the bears , and to humanity in general . As much as anything , this was an act of secret defiance against the Hefn . <p> Swelled with a sense of purpose , he fished out the flashlight , flopped on his belly , and crawled into the den . Aiming low , he switched on the light , the first light he had used to break the darkness for three days running . The rank heap of Rosetta lay on its side , casting a looming shadow on the wall of the den , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were snuggled against her . Denny crawled forward on his forearms , wildlife biologist displacing radical insurgent , beside himself with eagerness to see the cubs , see how much they 'd grown in more than two weeks . <p> His right hand had closed on the nape fur of the first cub , a bigger , fatter Rodeo , when the beam of the flashlight fell on the second cub . This was n't Rocket , he saw that at once . Rocket was gone . This cub was a little bigger than Rocket had been two weeks ago , but visibly smaller than Rodeo was right now , and more nearly black than cinnamon brown . How in the world had it gotten here ? He released his grip on Rodeo and reached for the changeling . <p> Just as he was about to touch it , the cub shifted its hold on the nipple , screwing up its little face against the light . Denny 's hand jerked back as if snakebit while his brain did a slow cartwheel , trying to interpret what he was seeing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a bear cub at all . Its shape and color were wrong , its proportions were wrong ... what was it ? What could have happened ? He squirmed closer and aimed the light directly at the cub 's head , trying to see its face . Again it screwed its eyes shut , and this time it let go of the nipple and made a thin sound of complaint . Its hairy little forelimbs , that had been rummaging in Rosetta breast fur , waved in the air , little arms ending in in <p> It felt like a crack of lightning . By straining every ounce of self-control Denny managed not to scream , not to flail his way out of the den . But he backed out a lot faster than he 'd crawled in , shutting off the flashlight before emerging not from prudence but by habit alone . He took off down the ridge trail toward the cabin by habit also , fleeing in blind panic until , inevitably , he tripped on something and fell flat . <p> Lying where he 'd fallen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a baby Hefn . A baby Hefn ! In a bear 's den ! There had never been a baby Hefn anywhere on Earth before - but a bear 's den in the middle of winter ! This was a mystery beyond all solving , but Denny had understood one thing the instant he laid eyes on the baby Hefn : his situation was no longer one of calculated risk but of imminent suicide . Probably no human in the world knew about this but himself . It was n't possible to imagine that the baby had been put into Rosetta 's den by anyone other than an adult Hefn , Humphrey or Innisfrey . The biologists had obviously been thrown out of this territory so the baby could be planted in the den . <p> Baby or babies ? Only this den , or others as well , in other study areas ? In other states ? Countries ! Denny shook his head to clear it , and stood up cautiously . It did n't matter ; what mattered was , he had to get out of here now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hefn humiliation event on the viddy . No disobedience of Hefn law could result more obviously in mindwipe than this one of his . There was no doubt in his mind that he had blundered onto something top secret , and none that the Hefn would be back often to check on their little bundle of joy . He had to get away . <p> But also , he had to leave no trace of his having been there , and in his panic flight he had left the daypack behind . Okay : retrieve the pack , then get down through the woods to the road as fast as possible , break camp , ditch the camping gear someplace , hotfoot it back to Lawrenceburg , and catch the first boat back to Carrollton tomorrow . Thinking these things , he groped his way back to the den . <p> And then what ? Denny stood staring at the great pale shape that was the gigantic fallen oak forming a lintel for the entrance to the den . A tree could grow that big on marginal farmland , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a fence line since it was a sapling . <p> Hop a boat to Carrollton , and then what ? Agree to study the Hurt Hollow bears , keep his head down and his mouth shut ? I should go back down there , he thought . It 's only been a couple of minutes and already I do n't believe it myself . If I 'm going to break the story ( was he going to break the story ? ) I have to know for sure that I saw what I think I saw . <p> If only I had a camera , he thought with regret . A holocamera , or a diskorder . Might as well wish for the Moon . But nobody 's going to believe this unless I have some kind of proof . <p> For a mad moment he considered kidnapping the baby Hefn , proof incontrovertible of what had happened here . But he did n't , of course , know how to take care of it , and if one hair of the baby 's bearded little chinny-chin-chin should accidentally be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , in one sense , Rosetta 's suckling cub and Rodeo 's foster sibling . He did n't want it on his conscience if somehow he ( he ? ) got hurt . <p> More than anything in the world , Denny did not want to go back down into Rosetta 's den , but he did it anyway . There was no mistake . The baby had tiny , forked , four-fingered hands , two digits opposed to the other two . It was hairy all over . It had whiskers . It was much darker than the adult Hefn , all of whom were varying shades of gray , but there could be no doubt that this was the infant form of the same kind of creature . <p> Having made certain of this , Denny wriggled back out into the night with only one urgent need on his mind . This time he remembered the pack , and remembered to head in the right direction , straight toward his campsite on the creek , a long up-and-down - mostly down - scramble in the dark . Interestingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving about in the dark . <p> He broke camp , stuffed all his gear into the duffel , and started , relatively sure-footedly , back down the road toward town . Having done this much , his mind began to hum and click ; and after a while he had a sort of plan . <p> Denny had been to Hurt Hollow lots of times , as a little school kid when Jesse Kellum was still the caretaker and keeper of the ( metaphorical ) flame , and afterward , when it had been closed to the public , as a Gaian initiate . He knew all about Orrin and Hannah Hubbell , the legendary couple who had built the house and kept goats and bees there , and written about their life " on the fringe of society . " They were classic proto-Gaians . While Jesse Kellum was caretaker , Pam Pruitt had been a girl living across the river in Indiana . She 'd spent a lot of time here in her teens , helping Jesse , even after the Hefn Humphrey had chosen her to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained by Humphrey in how to operate the Time Transceivers that could open a window into the past . <p> Denny also knew that Pruitt had lost her math intuition and no longer worked at the Bureau of Temporal Physics , though she continued to work with and for the Bureau . She had remained close to Humphrey , and had become prominent in the Gaian movement after leaving the Bureau 's Santa Barbara headquarters . Nowadays she was something or other to do with the Mormon Church , and ordinarily lived in Salt Lake City . <p> The reason he knew so much about Pam Pruitt was partly that she was a local celeb , the only Apprentice ever with close ties to Kentucky , and partly because she had been associated with Hurt Hollow in his mind as long as he could remember . The Hollow was important to all Gaians , but the place had been Pam Pruitt 's personal Ground before it ever became a shrine . She was part of Gaian lore in Kentucky , and especially in Denny 's home town of Milton , directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Scofield College campus where Pruitt had lived as a child . Though he 'd never met her , he 'd grown up knowing all about her . <p> Humphrey had said she was in residence now , probably on a personal retreat and not happy about being burst in upon . He was n't one hundred percent certain that she would n't betray him to Humphrey , but he thought not . And she had a lot of influence with the Hefn . If he was going to tell anybody , he could think of no better person to dump his problem on . <p> Denny boarded a southbound steamboat in Carrollton and got off at Milton with half a dozen other people . He could have asked the pilot to let him off at the Hurt Hollow landing , but it was n't a regular stop and he was afraid somebody might remember . Anyhow , from Milton you could walk to Hurt Hollow the back way , straight up the river bluff , along the bluff top by a maze of little roads , and down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at least he did n't feel obliged to hike all that way in the dark . <p> An electrified fence enclosed the whole sixty-one-acre tract of the Hollow from road to river . By the time he reached the upper gate it was late afternoon , and he was tired . He groaned at the prospect of bushwhacking all around the periphery of the property while the sky got darker and darker , but saw no alternative ; the house was close to the river bank , a mile or so below the upper gate . From the top there was no way to signal the house . Pruitt would n't hear him if he yelled , and somebody else very well might . <p> He 'd bought two sandwiches and an apple in Carrollton ; he ate these now , sitting with his back against the gate , and drank some water from the Girl Scout canteen in its red and green plaid cover . The rest of the camping gear had been cached under the Salt River bridge , halfway between the farm and Lawrenceburg , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He thought of tossing his duffelpack over the fence , so as not to have to lug it along . But if Pruitt had left the Hollow by now , and Denny could n't get in , he would need the stuff in the duffel . So in the end he started on what he hoped was the shorter way round the fence line with his burden still strapped to his aching shoulders . <p> It took him more than an hour to get down to the river , even traveling almost all downhill , and to work his way to the dock , but when he got there he saw the phone still mounted next to the lower gate . Thank God . Denny remembered how , on school trips , the teacher would pick up that very phone and a buzzer would sound faintly in the house , and Jesse Kellum would come down and unlock the gate . Now , if only the thing was in working order . How would he get Pruitt 's attention tonight if it was n't ? His tired brain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Denny could see an oil lamp shining in the window and a lit lantern on the patio outside , and he smelled wood smoke . He could also hear a dog barking . He dropped his pack on the dock , opened the little door , and took the receiver off the hook . The line sounded dead to him , but inside the house a shadow moved , then there was a click , and a woman 's voice said " Yes ? " into his ear , and then " Feste , be quiet . " <p> Denny realized he had n't thought out what he wanted to say . " Are you Pam Pruitt ? " he inquired in a croaky voice - how long since he had actually talked to anybody ? - and when she did n't answer he cleared his throat and rushed ahead . " My name 's Denny Demaree , I 'm a wildlife biologist , I 've been studying black bears in Anderson County , the Hefn recovery program ? I 'm a Gaian , the farm where I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could I speak with you ? " <p> There was silence . Then the voice said , " This is Pam Pruitt . What do you mean , something 's happened ? " <p> " I , uh , ca n't tell you about it like this , I need to talk to you in person . " <p> " Look , I 'm on a retreat . " <p> " I know , I 'm really sorry , but this is - this ca n't wait . This is huge , " Denny said . " Please . " <p> " You knew I was making a retreat ? " <p> " Not exactly , but the Hefn Humphrey told me you were here and I guessed it might be a retreat . I 'm really sorry , " he said again . <p> Another silence , then a sigh . " Okay . You 're on the dock ? I can come down for a couple of minutes . " <p> Relieved , Denny tucked the phone away . He saw the door open and the lantern begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become completely dark . Long before Pruitt reached the gate , her dog - so black Denny could see nothing but teeth and eyeshine - had rushed up and was growling through the woven wire . When she caught up with him , her first words were " Push up close against the fence and spread your arms and legs . Feste , check ' em out . Good boy , check ' em out . " Denny did as he was told , feeling foolish , while the dog sniffed him industriously all over through the fence . " Now turn around and do it again ... okay . Leave the bag where it is . Feste , on guard , " and he heard the gate click . <p> Denny stepped inside , and was suddenly conscious of his appearance , which the cold-water tap in the packet 's washroom had done little to improve . " Sorry I 'm so grubby . I 've been camping and did n't get a chance to clean up . " <p> Pruitt held the lantern up to get a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal mine ? " But she grinned as she said it . <p> " On the farm where my study was being done . Humphrey terminated the project and threw me off the place , uh , around two or three weeks ago now I think it was , I 've kind of lost track . " <p> Pruitt 's eyebrows shot up . " He threw you out and you snuck back in ? Have you got a death wish ? You could get yourself wiped for that . " <p> " Like I do n't know that ! The study was n't finished , " Denny said defensively , " but anyway , what he said was that East Central should be left to recover on its own now , but I do n't think that is why he kicked me out . Something else is going on . " <p> Pruitt slowly lowered the lantern . " Like what ? " <p> " You 're not going to believe me , " Denny said desperately , " I ca n't prove it to you , but last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check on the cubs , I had n't seen them since the day I got sent packing , I had a flashlight , and right away I realized that one of them was gone , and - " <p> " Oh-kay , " Pruitt said , interrupting him . " You better come on up to the house then . Get your stuff and close the gate - slam it good and hard . Feste , school 's out . Good job . " <p> Denny stared at her , feeling chilled . " You know about it . You knew what I was going to say . " He backed away , slipped through the gate and shut it between them with a clang . " You 're tight with Humphrey - " <p> " It happens , " said Pruitt mildly , " that Humphrey and I do n't see eye to eye on the subject of - what you were about to tell me . It 's your call , but you 're in big trouble right now , so unless you 've got someplace else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " <p> Denny sagged against the gate . The only other place he had to go , now that he knew what he knew , was back to work for Fish and Wildlife , which was itching to assign him to study bears right here in Hurt Hollow , only now he did n't even have that option if Pruitt exposed him to the Hefn . " How do I know you wo n't turn me over to them ? " <p> She had started toward the house , but turned back to face him . " I guess you 'll have to trust me on that , which I realize you have no reason to do , except that Gaians do n't lie to each other , do they ? And I give you my word that I wo n't . " <p> Denny trudged behind her up the path to the house , dragging his duffel , stumbling with exhaustion . Pruitt set the lantern down and opened the door onto a warm wooden room with a bright fire on the hearth . The dog slipped through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here before . " <p> " Yeah . Never at night , though . " By the firelight he got his first good look at Feste , who was now sniffing his hand , and let out a snort of laughter . " A poodle ? Your guard dog is a poodle ? " <p> " Hey , poodles can be great guard dogs , they just do n't usually look the part . With his hair cut like that , most people do n't even know he 's a poodle . " The dog , jet-black , was clipped short all over and resembled a Saluki with tight curls . <p> " Our neighbors had a standard when I was a kid . I remember that long nose . " He rubbed the dog 's head and stifled a yawn . <p> Pruitt gave him a scrutinizing once-over . " You 're completely done in . Why not get some sleep before we talk ? " And at his skeptical look , " Far as I know , nobody knows about your little escapade yet , unless you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of sleep ; you may get found out , but not by tomorrow morning . " <p> " Why , " asked Denny , " are you helping me ? Are you helping me ? " <p> " We 'll see , " said Pruitt . " First things first . " <p> " Who else knows ? " Denny asked this question while tucking into a bowl of goat stew . He had slept for eleven hours , then made excellent use of a bucket of hot water , a bar of soap , and Jesse Kellum 's straight razor . Now he sat at the Hubbies ' long , heavy table of dark wood , dressed in his last pieces of clean laundry from Louisville : a ratty pair of orange corduroys and a shapeless cotton sweatshirt with both elbows out . <p> " Search me . Maybenobody . I know because ... well , Humphrey would have a hard time deceiving me about anything , let alone anything this critical , even though he knew it would throw me into a quandary . I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into . " <p> Eating steadily , Denny kept his focus . " So what are they up to ? " <p> Pruitt propped her boots on the hearth , laced her fingers behind her head , and sighed heavily . She was a lean , severe-looking , rather mannish woman of forty or so , short brown hair mixed with gray . Denny thought her more attractive in person than in the holos and viddies he 'd seen , not that that was saying a lot , but he no longer felt apprehensive about whether he could trust her ; she was straightforward to the point of bluntness . " I 've been trying to figure out how much to tell you . It would have been a lot better for you - for me too , come to that - if you had n't been so pigheaded and intrepid about the damn bears . The reason I 'm making this retreat right now is to try to get clear about how to handle what I know . Now I have to get clear about how to handle what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front so far . " <p> Impatient with this dithering , Denny cut straight to the point . " Who put the baby Hefn in Rosetta 's den ? " <p> " I can tell you that . Humphrey did . It 's not his baby , but he did the placement . " <p> Alarmed , he demanded , " Did they tranquilize the mother ? " <p> " I would n't know . Probably . " <p> " Goddammit ! " And then , " What did they do with Rocket ? The other cub . " <p> " I do n't know that either . Gave him to a rehab outfit to raise as an orphan , most likely . " <p> " That sucks . " Furious , Denny pounded his fist on the table , rattling the spoon in his empty bowl . " Why 'd they do that ? Switch Rocket with the Hefn baby ? " <p> " Why . " Pruitt grimaced . " Sure you want to know ? You 'll be in even deeper . " <p> " If they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Anyway , how can I get in any deeper than I 'm in already ? " <p> " Okay , then . I only just heard about this myself a month or so ago . It turns out , " she said , " that the Hefn have n't been repairing the damage we did to the Earth entirely out of an altruistic desire to heal Earth 's biosphere . It turns out that the Hefn and the Gafr - " she glanced at him , looked away . " It 's like this . The Hefn and the Gafr are n't just connected in that master-servant sense we know about . They 're also sexually symbiotic . " <p> Denny 's jaw dropped . " Symbiotic ? Really ? " <p> " Really . Genetically they 're not even closely related , but neither can breed without the other . All the Hefn are male . All the Gafr are female . Everybody aboard that ship is , or was , part of a mated pair . The ship was looking for a place that was natural and unspoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , for some reason that has n't been explained to me , is no longer a suitable place to do that in . " <p> " They were looking for a place to breed when they found Earth ? " <p> " Right . " <p> " Four hundred years ago ? " <p> " Right . " <p> " And they marooned the renegade Hefn here intending to come right back for them - and stay , and start reproducing ! Only they had mechanical problems , and by the time they got back in 2006 , Earth was no longer natural and unspoiled enough ? " <p> " Right three times . " <p> " Now we come to it . " He shoved the bowl away and folded his arms on the table . " Why do they have to breed in the Garden of Eden ? " <p> " I gather , " Pruitt said slowly , " that the postnatal development of Hefn infants depends on spending a certain amount of time , at a certain stage , being raised in the wild by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer had a viable supply of nursemaid predatory species , and , not incidentally , we had way too many people . " <p> " Oh my God . " Denny , all biologist for the moment , looked thunderstruck . " That 's fascinating . That 's absolutely fascinating . " He thought a minute . " Chimps ? The big cats ? " <p> Pruitt got up and cleared away his cup and bowl . She brought a basket of wrinkled-looking yellow apples to the table and thumped it down on the floor . " The big cats are all still pretty endangered in the wild , except for lions and cougars , and anyway the Hefn do n't really relate to cats that well . " She half-filled a bucket with water , brought that to the table too , and started transferring the apples to the bucket , where they bobbed peacefully . " Chimps might have been a possibility - there 's a documented account that a group of them once adopted an abandoned Nigerian boy - but the Hefn needed to work with populations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , briefer childhood , faster bounceback . " She snorted . " I used to wonder why Humphrey was so interested in our myths and stories about feral children . When the Apprentices were kids in DC , he used to like to talk about that . Tarzan was a big thing of mine back then . " <p> " Wolves ! " Denny said . " Romulus and Remus . Mowgli . Those two girls in India . My God - the coyote field studies ! " <p> Pruitt had removed the empty basket and fetched large bowls and paring knives and a section of newspaper , and now she sat down , spreading paper in front of her like a place mat . She nodded . " Yeah . They ruled out every species that had n't been able to adapt to some degree to massive loss of habitat . Like tigers and chimps , wolves are too specialized . Coming back nicely now , of course ... but coyotes were never in any danger of being exterminated , no matter how intensively they were hunted , trapped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . The Hefn were very interested in the eastern coyotes , the big ones , for a while , but in the end they decided that black bears were a better answer . " While she talked , Pruitt had been taking apples from the bucket , quartering and coring them on the newspaper , and tossing the pieces into one bowl and the cores and excised bad bits into another . <p> Denny drew a sheet of newspaper in front of himself and picked up a paring knife . " Bears are n't very good predators , though . They 're fast , but not agile enough to prey on mature elk or deer , and as for rabbits and mice and like that , forget it . " He reached into the bucket for an apple . <p> " In fact , not being specialized has worked to their advantage , and anyway they 're apparently predatory enough for the purpose . And also , " pitching a double handful of pieces into the bowl , " there 's an authenticated account of a bear in Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Cross-species adoption , see , like the chimps and the Nigerian kid . Besides which , bears do exhibit one excellent behavior , if you 're a Hefn . " <p> Denny slapped the table . " They hibernate ! " <p> " They hibernate . The only large mammalian predator that does , if I 'm not mistaken . " <p> " Oh man . You 're saying - " Denny stared at Pruitt . " The Baby Ban . The Gaian Mission . All the habitat recovery projects . Think of everything the Gaians and the other eco-freaks have put up with , and supported , because we thought they were doing it to save the Earth - Gaia - and ultimately life on Earth , including human life . And all the time they were really doing it for themselves ! This changes everything ! " <p> Pruitt said unhappily , " It 's not that black and white . I 've been reevaluating everything I ever knew about the Hefn , believe me , these past few weeks . And I know - I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part , and some of the other Observers too - to connect with people and help them - help them adjust - just help them . " The apple in her hands was mostly rot ; she abandoned the effort to cut out the bad parts and dumped the whole thing in the compost bowl . " But behind all that , yes , it does look like there was always another agenda , even for Humphrey and Godfrey and Alfrey . Because , whatever they think personally , and however earnestly some of them have intervened on our behalf , in the end the Hefn serve the Gafr . We tend to forget that , because we never see the Gafr , but it 's all too true . All the Hefn we 've had any contact with were loyal to the Gafr when the rebels fomented their mutiny . " <p> Denny flung the knife down on the table so hard it skidded to the floor . " So that 's been their purpose right from the start ? Reduce-slash-eliminate the human population , the temperate forests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keystone predators return and the aliens have a choice of breeding grounds . Our breeding grounds . Humans are sterilized so the aliens can have children . This is n't going to play well in Peoria , " he said . <p> " No . " Pruitt got up and dumped the bucket of water , now empty of apples , into the sink . She picked Denny 's paring knife up off the floor and laid it on the counter , then went to build up the fire . " I think Humphrey really believed that the Ban would be lifted if things went well . Maybe the Gafr meant to lift it someday . But the whole deal has always hinged on connections between a few Hefn and a handful of people . Except for those relationships , the Gafr would have washed their hands of us long ago . " <p> She stood , a bit stiffly , to lift a Dutch oven off the hearth and hang it on an iron arm affixed to the side of the fireplace . She removed the heavy lid and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling to pieces of late . The more frantic people get , the more reckless they get . Now that we 've become so seriously endangered as a species ourselves , people naturally feel they have less and less to lose by defying the Hefn , and the Hefn have less and less reason to defend us to the Gafr . People are ready to explode even without knowing the Hefn and Gafr are breeding . If they find out - " <p> " Are you saying not to tell anybody ? " <p> Pruitt shot him a startled look . " Were you going to ? I thought you were looking for a bolt hole last night , not a reporter . " <p> They stared at each other . Denny dropped his gaze . " I do n't know what to do , " he admitted . " I 'm in danger of mindwipe because if I go public with this it could start a worldwide riot . But if I do n't tell - I 've never been able to stand the Hefn . If I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a coward , or both . " He got up and carried the heaping bowl of quartered apples to the hearth . " The plain truth is , I am a collaborator , even if I did n't really know it . All the field biologists are . What have we been doing but helping get Earth 's ecosystem ready to be an alien nursery ? " He did n't state the obvious - that if he was a collaborator she was a thousand times worse - but he did n't need to . <p> Pruitt took the bowl and said , " I need about a cup of water . " When Denny brought the water , she poured it into the Dutch oven , dumped in the apples , and stirred them briefly with a long wooden spoon . Then she clanged on the lid and swung the iron arm so the big pot hung over the fire . " Thanks , " she said . " I owe Humphrey more than I owe to any human being now alive . But his patience with the people he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit . And , of course , he 's utterly entranced with the thought of having a baby himself , his own baby . They 've all been waiting for this for a very long time , fearing all that while that they would never breed again , that their kind would go extinct . " <p> " So then they know exactly how we feel ! " <p> Pruitt looked downright haggard . " Denny , I need to know what you 're going to do . I doubt I can protect you if the Hefn find out what you know , even from Humphrey . What we need is a plan that will keep your paths from crossing . " <p> " Well , " said Denny , " when I get back from my leave - if I go back Fish and Wildlife has offered me reassignment . Here , as a matter of fact . Outside the fence , I guess they mean . " <p> " Here ? " Pruitt sounded astonished . <p> " Mm-hm , it was Humphrey 's idea . When I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my Ground , he apologized and said he 'd try to get me reassigned to Hurt Hollow , which I guess he was thinking is every Gaian 's Ground in a sense , as well as being yours , your own personal Ground . So if I do n't go public , I guess that 's what I 'll be doing . " <p> " Then I can tell you for a fact that Humphrey thinks the world of your work on the bears of Anderson County , " said Pruitt , clearly impressed herself . " You have no idea what a compliment that offer is , coming from him . As a matter of fact , the upper part of the fence is about to come down . <p> He wants bears to be able to get into Hurt Hollow . He wants his own son to be nurtured right here , right in the hottest Hot Spot of them all , and that sure is n't the best way I can think of to keep your paths from crossing . " <p> A sharp bark came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the dog in , along with a draft of cold air . " Wait a second , " said Denny , throwing himself back onto the bench . " Hold everything . If the Hefn and Gafr are going to start having kids right and left , and placing them in bears ' dens all over the map every winter , how long can the whole thing stay a secret ? One baby Hefn , okay . But dozens ? Hundreds ? There 's no way . " Feste trotted around the room sniffing at things , then sat down in front of Denny , looking expectant . He rubbed the dog 's ears absently and scratched under his chin . <p> Pruitt sat down on the bench across from him . " They 'll post all the territories with signs threatening mindwipe - " <p> " People are getting more reckless , you said it yourself . Some other biologist is going to refuse to be kicked out , same as I did . There 's no way they can keep the lid on . What if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering around with the mother bears ? " He leaned toward Pam . " What if somebody steals one out of a den ? Or kills one ? You know it could happen . " <p> " If the Hefn were n't keeping close tabs on them all - " <p> " But they 're not ! Nobody 's at my farm . Nobody was protecting the baby in Rosetta 's den . You 'd think they 'd have the whole ship watching over it . " <p> Pruitt rubbed her forehead , back and forth , as if trying to massage a headache away . " I guess keeping hands off , leaving it up to nature , might be a necessary part of Hefn child development . " She looked at Denny , tense on his bench as a sprinter waiting for the gun . " Humphrey did say this had to happen in the wild , that zoos would n't work . If they could have kept a supply of captive apex predators on their ship , I do n't suppose they 'd have stuck around Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dread of having my memory wiped . " <p> " And the planet would still be going to hell in a handbasket . " <p> " But it would still be ours . " <p> Pruitt 's eyebrows went up . " For how much longer ? " <p> Denny struck the table again . " You know what I think ? I think we 've been in a lose-lose situation all along here . I think if we 'd been left to ourselves we 'd either have poisoned and depleted the Earth beyond saving , or blown her up . Either way , extinction . And I think the Hefn have basically saved Earth 's ecosystem , but for themselves , and they 're going to force humanity into extinction anyway . " He laughed , a harsh sound in the cozy little house . " At least this way Gaia herself survives . She 'll do fine without us . As Gaians I guess we ought to be glad about that . " <p> " Hard for a Hefn-hating Gaian wildlife biologist to know which end is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering how to take this spiteful-sounding crack , she added , " But right now , this morning , this minute , I 'm thinking that you may have just hit the nail on the head . " She shoved back her bench and stood up . " This retreat is over . I need to talk to Humphrey . And you need to get out of the Hollow . Humphrey knows this place like the back of his hand . If you do n't want to go back to Fish and Wildlife you could hole up in my house in Salt Lake for a while - " <p> " I think I 'll go back to Louisville , " Denny said . " For now . I know some hidey-holes back there . " And when Pruitt looked dubious , " Everything 's happening too fast ! A few weeks ago I was a field biologist , then I was a subversive , now all of a sudden I 'm a fucking fugitive ! Every time I think I 've figured out what to do there 's a news flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's too crazy-making . I just want to go someplace quiet and think . " Denny got up , took his filthy parka down from the hook where she had hung it , and put it on . He grabbed the straps of his duffel , and he was ready . <p> The fire had burned down to coals . Pruitt banked these with a little flat tool and gave the apples another stir . She stuck some papers , and some cheese and walnuts and a few other food items , into a small pack of her own , and put on her jacket . All through these preparations Denny could feel how she was bursting to argue with him , persuade him to keep the secret to himself , but all she said was , " Let 's go , then . We row across to Indiana and catch the packet to Louisville . " Opening the back door , she let Denny step out first into the damp , chilly , gray day , then followed the dog out and pulled the door to with a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house locked when the fence comes down . " The thought made her grimace . " I 'm going to the outhouse . You ? " And when he shook his head , " Back in a minute then . Feste , sit . Stay . " <p> Pruitt took three paces down the path - and directly ahead of her the view of leafless trees and steep hillside and Orrin Hubbell 's studio began to spin . Denny shouted " Hey ! Hey ! " and dropped his bag . As they watched , the spinning air began to clarify from the center outward . <p> " Stay right where you are , " said Pruitt . " It 's a Time Window , opening from the future . " <p> " What 's going to happen ? " Denny asked , tensed to run . <p> " To us ? Nothing . Do n't worry , whoever it is , all they can do is look through and talk . " The bitterness had vanished from her voice ; she sounded flustered but excited . <p> Denny was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get to be on either side of a Time Window while it was actually working . All they ever saw were viddy recordings made through Time Windows , of historical events , edited by Temporal Physics technicians . This was raw footage , and he was in it - which might have been cause for panic , given his present situation , except - " How far in the future does a transceiver have to be to open a Window ? " <p> " Theoretically , not far at all . In practice , it 's impossible to set the coordinates if you 're not pretty far down the road . Like trying to read something printed on the bridge of your nose . " <p> Denny started to reply , but she waved her arm down to shut him up . The lens had clarified almost to the rim . At the center Denny saw a Hefn standing behind a strange metal contraption on legs , which he was obviously operating . Surrounding Hefn and transceiver , a disk of April pink smears of blooming redbuds , fervent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The rim stopped spinning ; the window was clear across its whole circumference . Stepping back from the machine , the Hefn came around where they could see him plainly . <p> Denny would have sworn he could n't tell one Hefn from another , but he understood at once that this was neither Humphrey nor Innisfrey . This Hefn was sleeker somehow , slimmer , less motley-looking . His hyped-up brain would have arrived at the obvious in another moment , but the sleek Hefn did it for him . " Hi , Pam . Hi , Denny . Hey there , Feste , you look just like your great-great-grandnephews ! Sorry to barge in on you like this . I 'm Terrifrey , by the way . Humphrey 's son . " <p> Pruitt said quickly , " Where 's Humphrey ? " <p> " Hibernating . He was up most of the winter . He 's fine , do n't worry . We had to make the decision to contact you without consulting him , but he - preapproved it , so to speak . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the side , beyond the edge of the lens , and another Hefn came and stood next to him . " We , " he said . " I 'm Dennifrey . Named after you , Denny . Nice to see you . " <p> Like a Time Window , Denny 's mind whirled and cleared . " You 're Rosetta 's baby Hefn ! " The Hefn nodded and beamed - or seemed to , since no Hefn could really do either . Instantly Denny said , " What happened to Rocket ? " <p> " He lived a long , happy life and fathered lots of little Rockettes . And Rodeo and I were close as long as she lived . I went to see her all the time . She had lots of babies too . " <p> " How do I know if you 're telling me the truth , or telling me what I want to hear ! " Denny protested . <p> " Oh , it 's the truth , all right , " said a third voice , and a wiry old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strolled into the spring landscape and stood beside the two Hefn , a sight so unexpected , and so shocking , that Denny almost blurted out " Paw ! " But his grandfather had been dead for years . He realized , with a dizzying lurch , that it was himself he was seeing . <p> The old man grinned at him , then beckoned in his turn , and the strangest figure of all entered the frame of the lens : a brown-haired girl of what , ten ? eleven ? Denny realized he could n't remember what children had looked like at various ages , not that he 'd ever paid that much attention . The girl was wearing a long blue dress and brown high-button shoes . " Hi , Grampa , " she said , and giggled . The old man put his arm around her , but she had spoken through the lens , to Denny . " I 'm Marny . I 'm your granddaughter . " <p> " My granddaughter ! " <p> Pruitt broke in . " The Baby Ban 's been lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hesitated and the girl looked sideways up at Terrifrey , who said carefully , " What you see , I 'm afraid , is all you get . We ca n't answer any questions of that kind . " <p> " That 's the one answer I need , " she said . " I 've got to know . " <p> " Well , it 's just what we ca n't tell you , " said Old Denny . " Not in so many words , because this - the four of us - is all I remember seeing in the Window . This is all that was shown to us . We had to take it from there as best we could . " <p> Pruitt drew in a shaky breath . Denny said to the girl , " Are you really my granddaughter ? " <p> Marny nodded vigorously . " You look really young . And you 've got more hair , and it 's dark . And no beard . This is weird . " She giggled again . <p> " It 's marvelous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to break contact now . " Humphrey 's self-declared son stepped back behind the transceiver . " Remember that Time is One . It 'll be okay . " And the disk of air spun inward while the others all waved , the alien and old man and the child , and in a few more seconds the wintry hillside had been restored to itself . <p> For a long moment Pruitt and Denny stood staring at the empty air . Then " Whuf , " said Pruitt quietly . " I guess we 're not going anywhere just yet . Except I 'm still going to the outhouse . Back in a second . " She pulled the door open . " Feste , in you go . " <p> Denny picked up his bag and went in too . The house was filled with the heavenly aroma of cooking apples . In a daze he unzipped his coat and sat down . " My granddaughter ! " he proclaimed to the black poodle , who turned around twice and slumped to the floor at his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na have a granddaughter ! " <p> " Before you start knitting booties , Grampa , " said Pruitt dryly , pulling off her pack and coat , " let 's think a bit about what they did n't say . " <p> Denny nodded . " That the Ban had been lifted . But there was Marny , Exhibit A ! " <p> " They did n't say she had n't been cloned . They did n't say she was n't a child actor derived from one of the people who missed the Broadcast . They did n't say things had been worked out between us and the Gafr . They did n't , when you get right down to it , say a hell of a lot . " <p> Denny thought , but had the presence of mind not to say , that another thing they had n't explained was Pruitt 's own absence from the tableau . ( There could be lots of reasons for that , but the likeliest one was that she had died . ) Instead he said , " But do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my granddaughter . Do you think Humphrey 's son would lie to you ? " <p> " Who knows ? Humphrey would n't , but Humphrey was n't there . " Pruitt 's excitement had turned to letdown , but Denny felt himself refusing to allow that to affect him . " What year would you think it was in the Window ? " <p> " You looked , what , about seventy ? How old are you now ? " <p> " Twenty-nine . " <p> " Well then . Forty years , give or take . So 2078 , 2080 ? Baby Ban plus or minus sixty-five . If the Ban has n't been lifted , the youngest human generation is in its sixties and our fate has been decided . " <p> " And if it has , things have worked out some way , and people are having babies again . " His mind was still suffused with the image of the little girl in the long blue dress - far more preoccupied with that , in fact , than with the sight of himself as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life unblemished by mindwipe . A granddaughter ! Necessitating a son or daughter in between ! <p> An hour ago Denny would have said he had no interest whatever in children , that his fury at the Hefn for imposing the Ban was principled and impersonal . Now the very idea that this vision of the future might be true thrilled him so much , it was hard - no , impossible , right now ! - to care about anything else . That humanity had a future , that he himself had a personal stake in it ! The possibility this latest news flash - more of a bombshell , really - seemed to promise had changed his world again ; he could feel himself being converted from cynicism to hopefulness , all the way through . " What did he mean about time is one ? " <p> " It 's a saying they have : ' Time is One , and Fixed . ' It means that whatever happens is the only thing that can happen . If two Hefn and you and a little girl appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment when a Time Window opens and those four beings speak to you and me on February 5 , 2038 . " <p> " But then , no matter what we do , it 'll work out that way . If I just go to bed for twenty years , that contact will still occur . " <p> Pruitt lifted the lid of the Dutch oven and stirred the apples , letting out a cloud of fragrant steam , then came and sat on the bench next to Denny . " The Hefn have another saying : ' What we never know is how . ' If a window opens in the future , they know of one little thing that will definitely happen , but not what else will happen between the present and that moment in the future . Maybe the ' how ' is that you call a press conference and announce that the Hefn are reproducing , using bears as surrogate mothers . Maybe it 's that you go back to work for Fish and Wildlife and get assigned here , and never say a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at baby Dennifrey and Humphrey catches you with your hand in the cookie jar , or you hide out in Utah and convert to Mormonism , or you go to bed for twenty years . You can say it does n't matter , but you still have to choose among alternatives , see ? And whatever you actually choose , that turns out to be ' how . ' Your choice is n't determined by anything , but it 's already there in the timestream . " <p> Denny shook his head dubiously . " I do n't really see why that 's not determinism , but never mind . I 'm making my choice . I 'm choosing to believe that I 'm really going to have a child and a grandchild , and that it means that up in the future where they are , human babies are being born , whether or not the Ban 's been lifted . So for now , I 'm deciding not to expose them . I 'm going back to Fish and Wildlife and take the Hurt Hollow assignment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face , close to his own , her expression unreadable . " That 's what you were hoping I 'd do , right ? " <p> " I 'm not sure anymore . " <p> The world seemed to have changed for her as well , but it was n't Denny 's problem . He stood and zipped his coat again . " You do n't need to row me over ; I 'll walk back to Milton and catch the Louisville packet there . No big rush now . " Despite saying this , he realized he could n't wait to be off . He grabbed his duffel 's straps with one hand and reached with the other for the door latch . " Thanks for everything . Will I see you when they send me back ? " <p> Pruitt stood , dug in her pants pocket and pulled out a key on a ring . " Probably not . I 'll need to be getting back to Salt Lake fairly soon . Here , take the gate key and let yourself out at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll pick it up later . " <p> " Well , " said Denny , " thanks again . " <p> " No problem . Good luck . " She held out her hand . <p> Denny gripped it . " I'llbe in touch . " <p> Outside he donned his pack and , feeling light as a milkweed parachute , bounded past the studio , across the bridge spanning the creek , and up the footpath he had last climbed as a boy of twelve . He felt like singing . He 'd had absolutely no inkling that he cared so passionately whether his species did or did n't have a future , or whether he , as a biological organism , would be allowed to fulfill his own reproductive drive . The world had opened up , enormous with possibility . <p> HE WAS FITTING the key in the padlock when the sound of a chopper abruptly cut across these thoughts like a shock wave . In seconds he could see the thing , flying lower , turning-yes , landing , in the road ; the cold blast from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence , hit him in the face . For an instant he panicked ; but then he saw his elderly self , standing in the Time Window with his arm around a little girl , and he closed the gate calmly and clicked the padlock shut . <p> Leaving the key in the lock as instructed , he turned toward the chopper . To his relief there seemed to be no one aboard but the pilot , who opened the passenger door and yelled , " Want a lift ? I 'm headed back to Louisville . " It was that Somebody Hoff man , the woman who 'd flown Humphrey to the farm the day his old world had collapsed . Denny ducked under the whirling blades , threw his duffel in , and climbed in after it . He strapped himself in and put on the headphones she handed him . " What are you doing here ? " <p> " Dropping off Humphrey . Did n't you see him ? He just got out . We spotted you coming up from the house and figured you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Denny grinned hugely . " Shrewd guess . That is exactly what I 've been doing . " <p> " If you 've decided to go with that , you might want to reconsider . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Tell you after takeoff . " The chopper lifted off and the view of the Hollow spread out below them : steeply sloping hillsides of bare trees , kinking creek valleys , and , in another minute , Orrin Hubbell 's house and studio , perched above the broad , winding , steel-colored Ohio River . Smoke floated from the chimney , and a tiny black dog danced back and forth on the shore , looking up and , no doubt , barking like anything . Inside , Pruitt would be putting the hot apple pulp through a colander . She must be wondering what the chopper was about , and half-prepared for Humphrey 's imminent appearance . What would they say to each other , while Pruitt stirred in nutmeg and cinnamon and assembled her canning paraphernalia ? Denny squinted into the leafless woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The chopper banked left and straightened out , following the river downstream . Somebody Hoffman settled back in her seat . " I do n't guess you 've heard about the bombings . " <p> Jerked back to the here and now , Denny said " Bombings ? No ! What bombings ? " <p> " It 's on all the newscasts . Terrorists blew up the headquarters of the Bureau of Temporal Physics in Santa Barbara last night . Also Senator Carpenter 's office in the Congressional Office Building - he 's chair of the Committee on Alien Affairs , I guess you knew that ? The bombs were synchronized to go off at one and four in the morning , so there were no fatalities and not many injuries , but they sure made a mess . " <p> " Who did it ? " <p> " A group calling itself Collaboration Zero . They issued a statement calling on every human being presently helping or cooperating with the Hefn in any way to quit doing that . They want people to quit voluntarily , but whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any lengths to stop them . Anybody they consider a collaborator , at every level of collaboration , will be a target . They 're claiming there are hundreds of resistance fighters , that the Hefn will never find them , and that this was a warning shot to convince everybody they can do what they say . " <p> " My God . " A literal chill went through him . " If they can decide who 's a collaborator , it 's a witch hunt . " It struck him that the Time Window had opened on this day because of what he was hearing now , that he had been shown the future before learning about the present . But why ? The sense of being thrown into uncertainty yet again made him feel almost frantic . " Yeah , and you and I are the witches , " the pilot was saying . " And besides that , they specifically named the Gaians as a group ; they 're ordering all the missions to terminate their alliance with the Hefn and operate independently . Humphrey did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he flew up here today . If those people know Pruitt 's here at Hurt Hollow , they might be coming for her . They could be anywhere . " <p> " But how many of these dudes can there really be ? " Denny protested . " They ca n't possibly do all that much damage if they stay undercover , plus security will be a lot tighter wherever there 's a potential target . Unless they 're suicide troops . Jesus , " he said , " I 'm having trouble taking this in . " <p> " They 're clever , " replied the pilot - Marian , that was her name . " Technically , by targeting the collaborators instead of the Hefn themselves , they 're not violating the Directive . They explicitly said they did n't intend to harm the Hefn , or break any Directive rules about transportation or the production and distribution of food or any of that . And the Gaians can go right on doing most of what they do . But if you 're a human being who helps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on helping them after today , look out . " She glanced over at Denny . " There do n't have to be that many of them to scare the living daylights out of people . Today is my last day flying this thing for Fish and Wildlife , I can tell you that , and I would n't be that keen to study bears in Hurt Hollow either . " <p> " Who are they , though ? What are they trying to accomplish ? " With part of his mind Denny was trying , unsuccessfully , to make this new upset fit with the vision he 'd been given . " I do n't see the logic of it , " he said , meaning both things . <p> " Me neither , which is why I 've started to wonder if this is maybe not so much about the Baby Ban , as just about standing up to the Hefn . " <p> " How do you mean ? " <p> " Well , you know - striking a blow for human self-respect . I mean , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted it makes no sense . But as a way to get people to stop cooperating with the Hefn - give them an excuse to stop , because in a lot of cases people would love to have an excuse - it kind of does . And let 's face it , how likely is it at this point that the Ban 's ever going to end ? " <p> Denny tried to focus his whirling thoughts . " Wait . You mean , like , if I quit studying bears because I refuse to work for the Hefn , they 're down on me . But if I quit because my life 's been threatened ... ? " <p> " That 's it . Like , I told Humphrey on the way up here that I 'm probably going to have to quit flying , because my mother would worry herself sick , and he seemed to accept that at face value . " <p> It did make a kind of sense , but - " But I do n't want to quit studying bears ! God knows , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or another , I bloody well want to keep on doing it ! " <p> Especially now . <p> He pictured a pipe bomb going off in the middle of the night , blowing the Hubbells ' cabin to smithereens with him in it . Then he pictured himself in the Time Window , an old man , his arm around a girl in a blue dress , and calmed down . Whatever happened he was n't going to die anytime soon , a victim of Collaboration Zero . <p> " - your business , " Marian was saying . " But I 'm going to find out who they are if I can , and what they 're really up to . " <p> They could see Louisville in the distance now . " How do you figure on doing that ? " <p> She shrugged . " Search me . I do n't know yet , but I 've got a few ideas . " Denny snorted . " And you think working for the Hefn is too dangerous ! " But an idea was forming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These Collaboration Zero guys , you know , they could be just what they look like . A terrorist gang . But even if it 's not what they have in mind ... might n't it be possible to cripple the Hefn without putting everybody at risk of mindwipe , by giving people a pretext to quit working for them ? I mean , we do n't have to help the bastards take us out ! You 're for sure dead right about what it would do for our self-respect , too , to stop cringing and groveling in the pathetic hope that the Baby Ban will be lifted someday . " <p> " Exactly . A kick in the butt . Something to shock us into realizing that even if we ca n't do anything about the Baby Ban , we 've still got options . " She glanced over at him . " If I find out , want me to get in touch ? " <p> " Yeah , I do , sure . " <p> " Where ? " <p> " Hurt Hollow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somehow , I belong on both sides of this fence . <p> She made a wry face . " Okay , if Hurt Hollow has n't exploded , bears and all , by the time Iget back to you . " <p> " And if nobody 's put a contract out on you . " <p> They grinned at each other , excited and stirred by new possibilities . The chopper was losing altitude now , homing in on the city . " Of course , the Gafr could still obliterate us , " Marian said . " Or just leave , and come back in fifty years . " <p> Denny thought of the baby Hefn in Rosetta 's den . " They wo n't do either of those things , " he said with certainty . " It 's too late to deal with us like that . " A watery Sun had come out . As Denny twisted and craned to watch the chopper 's shadow skim the river , an object in a sling behind the pilot 's seat caught his eye . " Whoa - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yep . Standard equipment on Fish and Wildlife helicopters . " <p> " Is it loaded ? <p> " Supposed to be . Why ? " <p> " Listen , " said Denny , " this being your last day and all , how about taking a little detour , while everybody 's focused on California and D.C. , and flying me out to my farm ?
