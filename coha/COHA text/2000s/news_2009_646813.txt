MAHAHUAL , Mexico  --  They appear out of nowhere like a heat-addled mirage on the flat , straight , mangrove-fringed road . The first sign of humanity in 40 miles , the tourists have ripened to pink under the glare of the tropical sun , with their legs wrapped around shiny red all-terrain vehicles buzzing down the asphalt like one giant invasive insect . <p> It 's a strange sight , all right . But it 's eclipsed moments later by an even stranger one . Looming on the Caribbean just beyond the end of the road is the world 's largest cruise ship , the Independence of the Seas , harboring a bounty of 3,811 passengers . <p> Thanks to cruise ships like this one , Mexico 's Costa Maya ( not to be confused with the Riviera Maya farther north ) , set along a once mostly deserted stretch of the Yucatan Peninsula , is becoming one of the most visited , albeit least known , tourist regions in the nation . In 2006 , just five years after the opening of the cruise ship facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the once tiny fishing village of Mahahual had exploded from 80 souls dependent on the sea , to 3,500 dependent on tourism . <p> The region begins about 80 miles south of Cancun and stretches from the vast Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve almost to the Belize border . It encompasses huge swaths of protected jungle , a number of lesser-known Maya archaeological sites , indigenous villages , pristine lagoons and top-notch diving . Plans call for low-rise , low-density development emphasizing small , eco-friendly hotels that cater to adventure seekers and cultural travelers . <p> South of Tulum , a lengthy stretch of almost uninterrupted resort development comes to an abrupt halt at the northern edge of the Sian Ka'an Reserve . The UNESCO World Heritage site ( whose name is Maya for " where the sky is born " ) is a 1.3-million-acre haven of tropical forest and wetlands . It 's alive with more than 300 bird species , pig-like peccaries , monkeys , puma and jaguar . It harbors turquoise lagoons where orchids and bromeliads cling to mangroves whose spiny roots grasp the earth like gnarled fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ka'an is n't set up for overnight visitors . But day trips are organized by a number of tour operators , including Community Tours of Sian Ka'an , a cooperative formed in an attempt to keep profits  --  and residents  --  in the small Maya town of Muyil . <p> The town lies across Highway 307 from Sian Ka'an and the Muyil Archeological Zone , where hills thick with overgrowth conceal the vestiges of old Maya temples . Antonio Caamal , 29 , who sports the short , muscular build and angled profile of his Maya ancestors , leads visitors up the narrow steps of the 800-year-old Pink Palace and chats about life in his tiny village . <p> " Most tourists who stay in the big hotels do n't know there 's a Maya community here , " he says . " They think the Maya disappeared . They did n't . Lots of people speak Maya . You just do n't hear it in the hotels and offices . " <p> Indeed , tours to Maya villages , which dot the southern Yucatan , have become more popular in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Miguel Quezada , a Sian Ka'an cooperative founder , takes exception with the portrayal presented by some operators , calling them inaccurate and disrespectful . <p> " They 'll ( stage ) houses with wild pigs and turkeys in them . We know we do n't live like that , " he says . <p> ' Everyone needs tourism <p> The 20 or so small homes in Muyil are a mix of stone , cement and traditional thatched roofs . Some sport satellite dishes . But even recently , the residents primarily raised corn , beans and squash and hunted wild game . Now , part of the village is delving further into touristic ventures with a butterfly garden and restaurant under construction . <p> " Everyone needs tourism . It 's hard to survive if everyone works in the fields , " says Alberto Cen , the cooperative 's treasurer . " And if Tulum ( 5 miles away ) becomes another Cancun , at least we can be prepared . " <p> The tourist hub of the region is Mahahual , thanks to the Puerto Costa Maya cruise-ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers in 2007 before Hurricane Dean delivered a Category 5 blow , destroying the town and taking the port out of commission for a year . The privately owned facility , with its swim-up bars , duty-free shops and choreographed floor shows , was conceived as a one-stop shop for the exclusive use of cruise passengers who prefer a sanitized version of Mexico . <p> " It 's very clean . Very secure , " says the port 's head of marketing Cesar Lizarraga , near where a tourist is posing for a photo with a trained monkey on his back . " You do n't see them , but there are surveillance cameras everywhere . " <p> In the town , a post-hurricane infusion of government money has spruced things up with a new 1.6-mile oceanfront promenade , underground utilities and a new lighthouse . Fresh signage keeps tourists on track , though it 's tough to get lost in two-road town . <p> Town has two faces <p> Actually , Mahahual is two towns . One is a quiet Mexican seaside village . The other emerges when the cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souvenir vendors , beachfront massage therapists , hair braiders and menu-waving waiters . Sunburned cruise passengers quaff beers at 10 a.m. , and Madonna blares from a seafront hotel where desk manager Elisa Poot assures an overnight guest : " No worry . When the cruceros leave , it 'll be tranquilo . " <p> At the Costa Maya 's southern reaches , die-hard divers and fly-fishing enthusiasts began trickling into the town of Xcalak in the late 1990s . <p> A number of small American-owned hotels have sprung up along the coast since then , but this scruffy end-of-the-road town remains largely undiscovered and tranquil . ( It got electricity only four years ago . ) <p> Offshore is a national marine park . Onshore , there 's little tourist-oriented commerce other than the lodgings , a few restaurants and a dive shop or two . For visitors , nightlife probably consists of telling fish tales around the hotel bar . But the profusion of " For Sale " signs on vacant oceanfront lots on the dirt road leading north of town indicates a boom may have begun . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were among the first North American residents . Schneider , an architect , built Sin Duda Villas , a small eco-friendly inn , 11 years ago . It 's the sort of place where even the tightly wound ca n't help but relax . The most taxing doings involve kayaking , snorkeling and collecting beach debris , with an evening toast over a batch of Reheis " Margo-ritas . " <p> Lovely as it is , this place is n't for everyone . <p> " When people ask about swimming pools and air conditioning and activity programs for their children , I explain nicely that this is n't for them , " Reheis says . " Some people ca n't survive if they ca n't go to the store or use a cellphone or leave the lights on . " <p> It feels like change <p> The opening of Mahahual 's cruise port has spawned tourist-oriented enterprises inland , as well . <p> At Chacchoben archaeological site , guide Luis Tellez ascends one of the stone temples and summons visitors by blowing on a conch shell , a la the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.D. 200 to 700 , are in a peaceful park-like setting , and are recently excavated , opening to the public in 2002 shortly after the cruise ships began arriving . " This place is getting visitors , thanks to the investment happening in Costa Maya , " he says . <p> Nearby on Laguna Bacalar , Mexico 's second-largest lake , Luis Gonzales manages Los Aluxes Bacalar , a handsome lakeside restaurant and adjoining small hotel . Bacalar has long been a popular second-home spot for Mexicans , but more recently , some North Americans are moving in . <p> Gonzales has heard rumors of a big residential development coming to the lake , whose crystalline blue waters are known as the Lake of Seven Colors . <p> " You can feel how things are changing , " he says . <p> What has n't changed <p> Elsewhere on the 31-mile-long lake , owners of communally held land that in the 19th and early 20th centuries harbored settlements for loggers and chicleros ( gatherers of sap for chewing gum ) have , with outside investors , created a cultural/adventure tourism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears tailor-made for cruise ship excursions , but operator Javier Guillermo is hoping the attraction 's appeal will exceed the day-trip crowds . <p> " What I like about this area is that it 's different from Cozumel or Cancun or the Riviera Maya , " he says , referring to the Yucatan 's busy tourist centers . " It 's quiet . It 's not crowded . It 's sustainable . If we mess with the reefs , the forest , the mangroves , our key selling point is gone .
