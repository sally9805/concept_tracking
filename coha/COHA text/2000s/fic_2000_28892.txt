Where Dreams Begin Chapter One London , 1830 She had to escape . The rumble of sophisticated chatter , the blaze of chandeliers that splashed hot wax onto the dancers below and the profusion of smells that heralded the lavish supper to come , all overwhelmed Lady Holly Taylor . It had been a mistake to attend a grand social event so soon after George 's death . Of course , most people would not consider three years to be " soon . " She had gone through the year and a day of Deep Mourning , barely venturing from the house except to take garden walks with her small daughter Rose . She had worn black bombazine and covered her hair and face with veils that symbolized her separation from her husband and the unseen world . She had taken most of her meals alone , covered all mirrors in the house with black crepe and written letters on black-banded paper , so that every interaction with the outside world would bear the sips of her grief . Second Mourning had come next . She had still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , on the third year after George 's death , Holly had undergone Half Mourning , which had allowed her to wear gray or mauve , and to participate in small , inconspicuous women 's activities , such as tea with relatives or close female friends . Now that all stages of mourning were finished , Holly had emerged from the dark and comforting shelter of the grieving period into a bright social world that had become terribly unfamiliar . True , the faces and the scene were exactly as she remembered ... except that George was no longer with her . She felt conspicuous in her aloneness , uncomfortable in her new identity as the Widow Taylor . Like everyone else , she had always regarded widows as somber figures to be pitied , women who wore an invisible mantle of tragedy no matter what their outward attire suggested . Now she understood why so many widows who attended events like this always looked as though they wished they were somewhere else . People approached her with sympathetic expressions , offered a small cup of punch or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , as if a social duty had been performed and they were now free to enjoy the ball . She herself had done the same thing to widows in the past , wanting to be kind and yet reluctant to be affected by the desolation in their eyes . Somehow it had not occurred to Holly that she would feel so isolated in the midst of a large gathering . The empty space beside her , where George should have been , seemed like a painfully obvious gap . Unexpectedly , a feeling akin to embarrassment came over her , as if she had stumbled into a place where she did not belong . She was half of something that had once been whole . Her presence at the ball only served as a reminder that a dearly loved man had been lost . Her face felt stiff and cold as she inched her way along the wall toward the door of the drawing room . The sweet riot of melody the musicians played did not cheer her , as her friends bad hopefully suggested . The music only seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swiftly as the other young women here tonight , feeling as if she were flying in George 's protective arms . They had been made for each other , and people had once commented with admiring smiles . She and George had been similar in size , with her own diminutive stature matched by her husband 's less-than-towering frame . Although George had been average in height , be had been wonderfully fit , and so very handsome with his golden brown hair and alert blue eyes , and a dazzling smile that was never long in hiding . He had loved to laugh , dance , talk ... no ball or crush or dinner party had ever been complete without him . Oh , George . A wet aching pressure grew behind her eyes . How lucky I was to have you . How lucky we all were . But how am I supposed to go on without you ? Well-meaning friends had pressured her to come here tonight , intending that this should begin the days of freedom from the smothering rituals of mourning . But she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her gaze scored across the crowd , locating various members of George 's family as they socialized and ate delicacies from gilded Sevres porcelain plates . His older brother , William , Lord Taylor , was escorting his wife to the drawing room , where a quadrille was about to begin . Lord and Lady Taylor were a well-suited couple , but their tepid affection did not begin to approach the genuine love that she and George had shared . It seemed that everyone in George 's family  --  his parents , his brothers , and their wives  --  had finally recovered from his death . Enough that they could take part in a ball , laugh and eat and drink , allow themselves to forget that the most beloved member of the family was in an early grave . Holly did not blame them for their ability to carry on , now that George was gone ... in fact , she envied them . How wonderful it would be to escape the invisible mantle of grief that covered her from head to toe . If not for her daughter Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant ache of loss . " Holland , " came a murmur from nearby , and she turned to see George 's youngest brother , Thomas . Although Thomas had the same attractive features , blue eyes and amber-streaked hair that all the Taylor men shared , he lacked the mischievous spark , the slow dazzling smile , the warmth and confidence that had made George so irresistible . Thomas was a taller , more somber version of his charismatic brother . He had been a steady source of support ever since George 's death from typhoid fever . " Thomas , " Holly said brightly , forcing a smile to her stiff lips , " are you enjoying the ball ? " " Not especially , " he replied , while sympathy flickered in the azure depths of his eyes . " But I believe I 'm navigating it better than you , my dear . There 's a pinched look on your face , as though one of your megrims is starting . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
