" Com-mence -- fire ! " <br> The blast of rifles shocked his ears , right and left ; he squeezed the trigger and felt the stock of his own rifle drive hard into his shoulder and cheek , and then he fired again . <br> They were lying prone on a damp Virginia ridge , firing down across a dismal slope of weeds at a simulated enemy position several hundred yards away -- a group of crude wooden house fronts flanked by clumps of trees . Gray silhouette targets darted in and out of view at the windows and came irregularly up from foxholes among the trees , and at first Prentice did n't aim at them very precisely : the main thing seemed to be to keep firing , to get off as many rounds as the men on either side of him . But after a few seconds the tension eased off and he became both careful and fast . It was exhilarating . <br> " Cease fire ! Cease fire ! All right , fall back . Everybody back . Second squad , let 's go . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle , got up , and stumbled back down the ridge with the others to where a small , painstakingly built campfire was struggling for survival . He made his way into the huddle of men surrounding it and found a place to stand beside John Quint . <br> " Think you hit anything , Deadeye ? " Quint asked him . <br> " A couple , I think . I 'm pretty sure I got a couple , anyway . You ? " <br> " Hell , I do n't know . " <br> It was the last afternoon of the week 's bivouac that was the climax of their training . Any day now they would be shipped out for overseas processing , and the company 's morale could not have been lower , but Prentice had begun to feel an unreasonable elation . It pleased him to know that he had n't bathed or changed his clothes for six days , that he was learning to handle his rifle as an extension of himself , and that he 'd taken part in elaborate field problems without doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized him ; he squared his shoulders , set his feet wider apart , and briskly rubbed his hands together in the woodsmoke . <br> " Hey Prentice , " said Novak , who had been watching him from the other side of the fire . " You feeling pretty sharp today ? You feeling like a real fighting man ? " <br> This caused a chuckle around the group , and Cameron , a big Southerner who was Novak 's friend , did his best to keep it going . " Old Prentice gunna be a regular tiger , ai n't he ? Jesus , I 'm glad he 's on our side . " <br> He tried to ignore them , continuing to rub his hands and stare down into the weak flames , but the sound of their bored , easy laughter had spoiled his mood . <br> Hardly any of the men in his platoon were less than five years older than Prentice ; some were thirty and a few were nearly forty , and a more surly , less amiable crowd he could never have imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pickett from other branches of the service -- this whole training regiment , in fact , was what the Army called an Infantry Re-Tread Center -- but there was a considerable difference between his case and theirs . He was a veteran of nothing more than six weeks of mild and pampered training as an Air Force recruit , followed by a shapeless month of work details in something called a Casual Company ; the others were all old-timers . Some were from recently dissolved Anti-Aircraft units , in which they had idled for years at the gun emplacements around West Coast defense plants ; some were from Ordnance or Quartermaster depots ; there were ex-cooks and ex-clerks and ex-orderlies , and there were washouts from various officer-candidate schools . Many of them were noncoms in line or technical grades and continued to wear their impotent chevrons , but all of them -- every foulmouthed , hard-drinking , complaining one of them -- had in common the miserable fact that their good deals , their months or years of military safety were over . They were replacement riflemen . <br> And if Prentice had entertained any notion of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stretch " by these men , of relaxing with them in the easy camaraderie of his Air Force days , it was a hope he 'd had to abandon at once . They called him " Kid " or " Junior " or " Prentice " or nothing at all , and their general indifference had soon turned into a contemptuous amusement . <br> On the very first morning , late for Reveille and sleepily fumbling with his unfamiliar infantry leggings , he had put the damned things on backwards , with the hook lacings on the inside rather than the outside of his calves ; he had taken four running steps across the barracks floor before the lacing hooks of one legging caught the lace of the other , and down he came -- all gangling , flailing six-foot-three of him -- in a spectacular lock-legged fall that left his audience weak with laughter for the rest of the day . <br> And thereafter he had gone from bad to worse . He was incurably clumsy at close-order drill ; he could n't perform the manual of arms without an unsightly dipping of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field his spindly , ill-coordinated body was put to tests of reflex and endurance that seemed wholly beyond its powers , and he repeatedly floundered and failed . <br> Worse still , he found himself unable to accept his defeats with any kind of grace . He would rise from each humiliation with a mouthful of shrill obscenities , trying by sheer verbal unpleasantness to beat these laughing bastards at their own game , and the result of this was to lower him still further in their esteem . An all-around incompetent was bad enough , and a wet-behind-the-ears young twerp of an incompetent was worse ; but when he turned out to be a little wise guy too -- when he swore not only in bad temper but in what sounded like the clipped , snotty accents of a spoiled rich kid -- that was too much . <br> And then one morning after bayonet drill , when the company was marched into a stifling clapboard building for its weekly I. and E. lecture , he found a way in which his luck might possibly begin to change . The lecture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunderously identified on the screen as one of the Why We Fight series , which explained the evils of Nazi Germany in simple-minded words and pictures ; then a droning talk by a bored-looking second lieutenant who explained it all over again , and then the question period . <br> A man several seats away from Prentice got up to raise a question -- a quiet ex-Ordnance man from Idaho whom he 'd sometimes noticed smoking a pipe in the post library , a man named John Quint -- and from the moment he began to talk Prentice sat spellbound . <br> " I 'd like to take issue , sir , with one or two of the points made in the movie just now . Actually , they 're things I 've noticed cropping up time and again in the Army 's indoctrination program , and I think we might do well to examine them a little more closely ... " <br> It was n't what he said that mattered , though all of it was interesting and thoughtful ; it was the remarkable ease and confidence of his delivery . Here was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five -- and a bespectacled , almost prissy-looking man at that , a man whose vocabulary and enunciation clearly marked him as " cultivated "  - -  and without the slightest compromise , without any hint of talking down to them , he was holding the respectful attention of every muscle-headed slob in the room . He even got a few laughs -- not by any clumsy descent into G.I. humor , but by urbane and witty turns of phrase that Prentice would have thought to be miles over their heads . Hooking his thumbs in his cartridge belt , courteously turning from one section of his audience to another as his glasses gleamed in the lights , he was using words like " ludicrous " and " corruptible " with the dark sweat of the day 's bayonet drill still staining his back : he was proving that you did n't have to be a lout to be a soldier . <br> When he finished and sat down , there was a spatter of applause . <br> " Yes , " the lieutenant said . " Thank you . I think that was very well put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all , but it was enough to give Prentice a sharp new focus for his yearnings . He knew what he wanted in the Army now . The hell with this childish nonsense of being " liked " or " disliked , " of being " accepted " or not . All he wanted now , beyond a certain basic competence , was to be as intelligent and articulate as Quint , as independent as Quint , as aloof from the Army 's indignities as Quint . He very nearly wanted to be Quint , and at the very least he wanted to get to know him . <br> But the fool of the platoon could hardly buddy up with its one and only intellectual -- not , at least , right off the bat . It was a thing that would have to be pursued very cautiously , and with no visible effort at pursuit . <br> It began that very evening , when he strolled over to Quint 's bunk for a desultory chat and was careful to walk away again before there could be any hint of his imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library but thought better of going over to start another conversation , though he was careful to display the title of the rather highbrow book he was carrying , in case Quint happened to look up as he passed by on his way to the charge-out desk . Then , luckily , the company began its week of training on the rifle range , marching out there before dawn each morning for a nine-hour session with the targets , and this routine left long conversational openings in the middle of the working day . There were whole half-hours with nothing to do but sit around and wait for your turn on the firing line , and there was even more leisure during the noon meal , which was served in mess kits from a mobile field kitchen . Prentice made the most of those chances ; it was n't long before he and Quint were pairing off at each break , almost as a matter of course . Then when the company went out on bivouac they pitched their shelter halves together and shared the cramped , wet , two-man discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colds . <br> By now they had grown as close as members of the same unhappy family , but Prentice knew they could n't yet be accurately described as friends , let alone as " buddies . " They did n't even look right together : Prentice was at least nine inches too tall , with a small , large-eyed face still nakedly eager for approval ; Quint was solid and settled in chronic exasperation . <br> As they trudged side by side in a column of twos for the five-mile march back to the barracks , under full field packs , Prentice was determined not to open any conversation . If they were going to talk at all , Quint would have to start it ; and at least two and a half miles of silence went by before Quint said , " Cherrystone clams . " <br> " What ? " <br> " Just thinking about a meal I had once in San Francisco . " Quint winced in tiredness as he eased his rifle sling into a more comfortable place on his shoulder . " Best damn restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't remember the name of it . You ever have cherrystone clams ? On the half shell ? " <br> And soon they were engaged in what promised to be a long , wistful discussion of the ultimate and perfect dinner , a dinner presumably to be shared some day after the war in the best damn restaurant in the world . It would begin with cherrystone clams and proceed to a celebrated kind of soup that only Quint had ever tasted . <br> " Okay , " Prentice said , " and then what ? A big steak , I guess , or a big piece of roast beef with --  " <br> " No . Hold on a second , Prentice ; do n't let 's bolt the whole meal at once . You 're forgetting all about the fish course . " <br> " Okay . " And as they debated possibilities for the fish course it was all Prentice could do to keep his voice from rising and giggling in pleasure like a girl 's . <br> " Then we 're agreed on fillet of sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now it 's time for the main dish . And listen , do n't let 's be too hasty about the steak or the roast beef -- there 's plenty of other things . Let 's think a minute . " <br> Prentice thought a minute , and while thinking , he allowed one of his worst military habits to repeat itself . His toe scraped the heel of the man walking ahead of him , an ex-Engineer corporal named Connor whose heels , as he often and loudly told everyone , had been stepped on by Prentice every God damned time Prentice followed him in the marching order . And because Prentice had long since learned that no kind of apology would work with Connor , he could only assume a grave and self-protective look of idiocy when Connor turned around and said , " God damn it , Prentice , will you watch your feet ? " There followed a silence of ten or twelve paces , while Prentice wondered how soon it would be all right to resume the talk of the ideal dinner . <br> It was Quint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of it , " he said , " I guess you 're right , Prentice . There is n't anything better than a steak . Let 's make it two filet mignons , then , medium rare . And what 'll we have on the side ? French fries , I guess , but I mean what kind of vegetable ? Or would you rather skip the vegetable and have a salad ? " <br> " Right . Let 's do that . Let 's just have a big sal --  " and then , hating himself , he stepped on Connor 's heel again . But there was barely time for Connor to turn around and say , " Prentice , will you watch your fucking feet ? "  - -  there was barely time for that before Prentice saw something funny in the movements of the men ahead . Far up in front , where the captain was , they had all hunched over and broken into a trot , and they seemed to be taking off their helmets . Nearer , just ahead of Connor , some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , before he could bring his mind into focus , something small and indistinct fell into the dust at his feet and exploded with a soft little noise -- Pluff !  - -  and his eyes and throat were attacked by fire . <br> He could n't see and he could n't breathe . He crouched , both hands grabbing for his eyes as his rifle swung clumsily loose at his elbow . <br> " Keep moving , men , " somebody was calling . " Keep moving ... " <br> Stumbling and pushed heavily from behind , he lost his balance and fell on the road and rolled , legs in the air -- all this happened before the first clear thought occurred to him : Tear gas . <br> And it was an agonizingly long time after that , while he scrabbled on all fours to retrieve his rolling helmet , before he thought of what to do about it -- before his right hand clawed at the canvas pouch that had ridden under his left armpit for weeks , tore it open , and pulled out the wobbling rubber paraphernalia of his gas mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
