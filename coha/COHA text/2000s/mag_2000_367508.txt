When Manoj Night Shyamalan was growing up in suburban Philadelphia in the 1980s , his parents  --  both immigrants from India , both physicians  --  piled on the pressure . " There was simply an assumption that I 'd come first in my class , " he recalls . He was also expected to follow his parents into medicine . When he told them he would instead study moviemaking at New York University , they were horrified . Now they feel a lot better . In 1997 , five years after his graduation , Walt Disney Studios paid Shyamalan $2.5 million for the screenplay of the Bruce Willis thriller The Sixth Sense and let the young writer direct the movie as well . The ghost tale has earned more than $680 million worldwide since its release last year and garnered six Academy Award nominations . " If it had n't grossed $100 million , " he laughs , " I do n't know what my parents would have done . " <P> Shyamalan , 29 , did not win an Oscar on March 26 , but he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America 's premier success symbols for 722,000 Indian immigrants and guest workers scattered across the country . And he is only one among many . Today South Asian immigrants are climbing the top rungs in just about every industry . <P> Indians are running FORTUNE 500 companies ( Rono Dutta is president of United Airlines , and Rakesh Gangwal is president and CEO of U.S. Airways ) or , as consultants and securities analysts , telling others how to do so . ( Calcutta-born Rajat Gupta , managing director of consulting giant McKinsey &; Co. , does both . ) But above all , they are bringing their own entrepreneurial stamp to America 's high-tech frontiers . Venture-capital fund Kleiner Perkins Caufield &; Byers , one of Silicon Valley 's biggest VC firms , says 40% of its portfolio consists of companies founded or managed by people of Indian origin . Indians have one of the highest per capita incomes of any immigrant group in the U.S. " It is a credit to this country that someone from a distant land can become an American , " says Suhas Patil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1999 revenues : $564 million ) , who is now running an incubator company called Tufan , Inc. for Internet start-ups . " I am what defines America . " <P> The Indian success story is a triumph of quality over quantity . According to the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington , an independent think tank , the U.S. is home to about 26.3 million immigrants , defined as people living in the U.S. who are foreign born and have permission to stay permanently . India 's 722,000 is less than the number from the Dominican Republic . Some 15,000 to 20,000 Indians get student visas to the U.S. each year , and many manage to land jobs after graduation and stay on . But Japan gets three times that number , and South Korea double . The only category in which India really leads immigration statistics is the number of people granted H1B visas for " workers with speciality occupations . " Indians take about 20% of all H1B visas issued each year , by far the largest proportion . <P> Other numbers tell an even more intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poverty line , vs. 31% of Mexicans and 8% of immigrants from Britain . Fewer than 1% use public assistance .
