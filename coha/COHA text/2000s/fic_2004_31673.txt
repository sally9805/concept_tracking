In the City of Golden Bells THE GARDEN MARKET positively thronged with people , clustered around the wagons just in from the countryside . What a fuss over strawberries -- you 'd think they were made of solid ruby . Perhaps -- to some -- they were . Certainly the number of superior kitchen servants that filled the streets of the Garden Market , their household livery enveloped in spotless aprons , pristine market baskets slung over their arms , suggested that the gourmets of the City treasured them as much as if they were , indeed , precious gems . Kellen Tavadon supposed it was all a matter of taste . The strawberries were said to be particularly good this year , and there must have been a hundred people waiting impatiently for the three ox-carts in from the country to unload the second picking of the day , great crates full of the tender fruit , layered in fresh straw to keep from bruising the delicate flesh . The air was full of the scent of them , a perfume that made even Kellen 's mouth water . " Out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kellen 's back sent him staggering across the cobbles into the arms of a marketplace stall-holder , who caught him with a garlic-redolent oath just in time to keep him from landing face first in the cart full of the man 's neatly heaped-up vegetables . Behind Kellen , the burlyarmsman dressed in purple-and-maroon livery and bearing nothing more lethal than an ornamental halberd dripping purple-and-maroon ribbons shoved another man whose only crime was in being a little too tardy at clearing the path . This victim , a shabby farmer , went stumbling in the opposite direction , and looked far more cowed than Kellen had . A third , a boy picked up by the collar and tossed aside , saved himself from taking down another stall 's awning by going into the stone wall behind it instead . All this rudeness was for no greater purpose than so the armsman 's master need not be jostled by the proximity of mere common working-folk who had been occupying the space that their superior wished to cross . Kellen felt his lip curling in an angry sneer as he mumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Damn the idiot that has to make a display of himself here ! He picked a fine time to come parading through , whoever he is ! The Garden Market could n't be more crowded if you stood on a barrel and yelled , " Free beer ! " Then again -- maybe that was the point . Some people could n't see an opportunity to flaunt their importance without grabbing it and wringing every last bit of juice out of it . Father , for instance ... Kellen turned just in time to see that the Terribly Important Person in question this time was High Mage Corellius , resplendent in his velvet robes and the distinctive hat that marked him as a High Mage and thus a creature of wealth , rank , and power . Quite a hat it was , and Corellius held his scrawny neck very upright and stiff supporting it -- a construction with a square brim as wide as his arm was long that curled up on the right and the left . It had three gold cords that knotted around the crown and trailed down his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kellen 's hand . Corellius 's colors were purple and maroon , and they suited him vilely . Not only did the shades clash , they made him look as if he had a permanent case of yellow jaundice , which condition was not at all improved by the wattles of his throat and the mottled jowls hanging down from his narrow vulpine jaw . His beady little eyes fastened on Kellen just long enough for Kellen to be certain the smirk on the thin lips was meant for him , then moved on , recognizing Kellen and dismissing him as a thing of no importance . Kellen flushed involuntarily . Which I am , of course . Father 's position and glory hardly reflect on his so-disappointing son . And if I were as properly ambitious as I 'm supposed to be , I would n't be wandering about in the market in the first place . I 'd be at my studies . The official ranks of Magecraft progressed from the Student at the very beginning of the discipline , through Apprentice , to Journeyman , to Mage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beneath Corellius 's notice under the usual circumstances . But Kellen was no ordinary Student . Not with the Arch-Mage Lycaelon -- head of the High Council , and therefore Lord of all the Mages in the City -- as his father . Kellen glowered at the High Mage 's back . There was no doubt in his mind Corellius had recognized him , even dressed as he was . How could he not , considering who Kellen 's father was ? " That 'd be a High Mage , then ? " asked the stall-holder , conversationally . " Do n't suppose ye know which one ? " Kellen shrugged , not at all inclined to identify himself as someone who would know High Mages on sight . He 'd worn his oldest clothes into the City for just this reason . " Maroon and purple , that 's all I know , " he replied untruthfully . " Do n't know why a High Mage would be barging through the Garden Market , though . " " Wondered that myself . " The stall-holder shrugged , then lost interest in Corellius and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , positioned herself under the man 's red-striped awning , and began to pick over the carrots . Kellen moved on , taking a path at right angles to Corellius 's progress . He did n't want to encounter the High Mage again , but he also did n't want to fight his way through the wake of disturbance Corellius had left behind him . The Garden Market , with its permanent awnings that were fastened into the stone of the warehouse buildings behind them and unfurled every morning , was full every day , but other markets were open only once every Sennday , once a moonturn , or once a season . The Brewers ' and Vintners ' Market was open today , though , over in Barrel Street , for instance . The brewers were in with Spring Beer today , which , along with the new crop of strawberries , probably accounted for the heavy traffic here in the Market Quarter . Probably accounts for Corellius , too . Kellen knew the High Mage 's tastes , thanks to overheard conversations among Lycaelon and his friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated beverage than beer , but his pretense was as bogus as -- as his apparent height ! Just as he wore platform soles to his shoes , neatly hidden under the skirt of his robe , to hide his true stature , his carefully cultivated reputation as a gourmet concealed coarser preferences . His drink of choice was the same beer his carpenter father had consumed , and the stronger , the better . He might have a reputation for keeping an elegant cellar among his peers and inferiors , but his superiors knew his every secret " vice . " They had to : only a convocation of High Mages could invest a Mage into their exalted ranks , and it behooved them to know everything about a potential candidate . Little did Corellius know that a frog would fly before he was invested with the rank he so coveted . The High Mages would have understood and accepted a man who clung to his culinary roots openly -- but a Mage who dissembled and created a false image of himself might find it easy to move on to more dangerous falsehoods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear of the Brewers ' and Vintners ' Market . Corellius would be in there for bells , tasting , comparing , pretending he was buying for the table of his servants , while brewers fell over themselves trying to impress him and gain his patronage . And as long as the Mage dallied in the market , no one else would be served , which would make for a backlog of a great many impatient and disgruntled would-be customers . But they would just have to wait . This was the Mage-City of Armethalieh and only another Mage , senior in age or higher in rank , could displace Corellius from his position of importance . Mages had built it , Mages ruled it , and Mages were the only people of any real consequence in it , though it had nobility and rich men in plenty . It did n't matter if Armethalieh traded with the entire world and held rich merchants within her walls , or that she could boast nobles whose bloodlines went back centuries , some with more wealth than any ten merchants combined . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only men who had it , and they guarded their privileges jealously . Not that they did n't earn those privileges . Magick infused and informed this City , often called " Armethalieh of the Singing Towers " for all of the bell spires piercing the sky . Magick ensured that the weather was so controlled that -- for instance -- rain only fell between midnight and dawn , so that the inhabitants need not be inconvenienced . Magick kept the harbor clear and unsilted , guided ships past the dangerous Sea-Hag 's Teeth at the mouth of it , and cleansed the ships that entered it of vermin . There was magick to reinforce any construction , so that ( in the wealthiest parts , at least ) the City looked like a fantastic confection , a sugar-cake fit for a high festival . The City stretched toward the sun with stonework as delicate as lace and hard as diamonds , be-towered and be-domed , gilded and silvered , jeweled with mosaics , frosted with fretwork . Things were less fanciful in less exalted quarters , but still ornamented with gargoyle downspouts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , too , and nearly every block boasted its own bell tower , with still more magick ensuring that all of the songs of the towers harmonized , rather than clashed , with each other . Magick set the scales in the marketplace and ensured their honesty . Magick at the Mint guaranteed that the square coins of the City , the Golden Suns of Armethalieh , were the truest in the world , and the most trusted . Magick kept the City 's water supply sweet and uncontaminated , her markets filled with fresh wholesome food at every season , her buildings unthreatened by fire . There were entire cadres of Mages on the City payroll , dedicated to magick for the public good . If they were well paid and well respected , they had earned both the pay and the respect . Even Kellen , no friend of Mages , had to admit to that . Life in the City was sweet and easy . As for the private sector , where the real wealth was to be made , there were far more opportunities for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life that could not be enhanced by magick . Domestic magick , for instance . If you had the money , you could hire a Mage to thief-proof your house or shop , to keep vermin out of it , to keep disease from your family , and to heal their injuries . If you had the money , you could even hire a Mage to create a winter-box where you could put perishables to keep them from spoiling . And there were even greater magicks to be had -- magicks that melded brick-and-mortar into a whole more solid than stone and harder than adamant . Magicks that kept a ship 's sails full of favoring wind no matter what the real conditions were . Money bought magick , and magick made money , and no matter how lowly born a Mage was -- and the Magegift could appear in any family , regardless of degree of birth ( Corellius , for example )  - -  he could count on becoming rich before he was middle-aged . He might become very rich . He might aspire to far more than mere wealth , if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a voice in ruling the City itself . Most important of all of the folk of the City were the Mages , and the most important of all the Mages were those High Mages who formed the elite ruling body of the City , the High Council . They were considered to be the wisest of the wise ; they were certainly the most powerful of the powerful . If there was a decision to be made about anything inside the walls of the City , it was the High Council that made it . And that was what stuck in Kellen 's throat and made him wild with pent-up frustration . If there is a way to fetter a person 's life a little further , it is the High Council that puts the pen to the parchment , Kellen thought sourly as he made his way past the Tailors ' Mart and the stalls of those who sold fabric and trimmings . His goal was the little by-water of booksellers , but he would have to make his way through most of the markets to get there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen , and had been a Student for three years now , and although that was probably the acme of ambition for most young men in this City , he would rather have forgone the " honor " entirely . It would have been a great deal easier , all things considered , if he had never been born among the Gifted . On the whole , he would much rather have been completely and utterly ordinary . His father would have been disgusted . And I could have gotten out of this place . I could have gone to be a sailor ... It would have gotten him as far as the Out Islands , at least . And from there , who knew ? Mages were n't always born to Mage fathers , and certainly not only to Mages , but in Kellen 's case , if he had n't been among the Gifted , Lycaelon would probably have had apoplexy -- or gone looking for his wife 's extramarital interest . Or both . The blood in Kellen 's veins contained -- as he was reminded only too often -- the distillation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat of a Lord of the High Council at some point during their lifetimes . That was difficult enough to live up to , but he was also the son of the Arch-Mage Lycaelon Tavadon , ruler of the City and the current Arch-Mage of the High Council . That made his life so unbearably stultifying that Kellen would gladly have traded places with an apprentice pig-keeper , if there were such a thing to be found within the walls of Armethalieh . Wherever Kellen went in his father 's world , there were critical eyes on him , weighing his lightest deed , his least word . Only here , in the " common " quarters of the artisans , the shopkeepers , and the folk for whom magick was a rare and expensive commodity , here where no one knew who he was , did Kellen feel as if he could be himself . And yet , even here , the heavy hand of Arch-Magisterial regulation intruded . For these were the markets of Armethalieh , and Armethalieh was the greatest city in the world , after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abounded . The harbor welcomed ships from every place , race , and culture , and caravans arrived at the Delfier Gate daily laden with goods from every conceivable place . There should be a hundred , a thousand new things in the market whenever it opened . And yet -- And yet the High Council intruded , even here . They , and not the merchants , determined what could be sold in the marketplace . And only products that had been approved by the High Council could make an appearance here . Inspectors roamed the streets , casting their critical eyes over the stalls and stores , and anything that looked new or different was challenged . In fact , there was one such Inspector in his black-and-yellow doublet and parti-colored hose just ahead of Kellen now . The Inspector was turning to look at the contents of a ribbon-seller 's stall with a frown . " What 's this ? " he growled , poking with his striped baton of office at something Kellen could n't see . The stall-holder did n't even bother to answer or argue ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evidently , this Inspector was a fellow well known to the merchant . " Council 's allowed it , Greeley , so take your baton off my property afore you spoil it , " the man growled back . From his look of offended belligerence , Kellen guessed that the merchant had been targeted by this particular Inspector in the past . The Inspector removed his baton , but also picked up the permit and examined it minutely -- and managed to block all traffic down this narrow street as he did so . Kellen was n't the only one to wait impatiently while the surly , mustachioed official took his time in assuring himself that the permit was entirely in order . Granted , some merchants had tried -- and probably would continue to try -- to use an old permit for a new offering , bypassing the inspection process , but that did n't mean the old goat had call to block the street ! " It 's in order , " Greeley grunted at last , and finally moved away from the stall so that people could get by again . " Interfering bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even if it was n't , what difference would a new pattern of woven ribbons make , for the Eternal Light 's sake ? " Kellen glanced down curiously to see the disputed objects that had so raised the Inspector 's ire . The merchant was smoothing out his wares , and Kellen could easily see why the Inspector 's interest had been aroused . The ribbons in question were of the usual pastel colors that custom decreed for female garb , but the patterns woven into them were angular , geometric , and intricate , like the mosaics made from square ceramic tiles by the Shanthin farmers of the north . There was n't a hint of the flowers and leaves usually woven into such ribbons , and although he was n't exactly the most expert in matters of lady 's dresses , Kellen did n't think he 'd ever seen ribbons like this before . Well ! Something new ! And the merchant was right -- what difference could this make to anyone ? Despite the Council 's eternal restrictions , the Market Quarter was still a lush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Spice Market to the feast for the eyes of the fabrics in the Clothworkers ' and Trimmers ' Market . But though there was a great deal of abundance , and it was all wonderfully extravagant ( at least , in the markets that Kellen 's class frequented ) , creating an impression of wealth and plenty , it was all the same as it ever had been , or ever would be , except in the minutest of details . It was the same way throughout the entire City -- throughout Kellen 's entire life -- tiny meaningless changes that made no difference . A pattern here , a dance step there , a scarf added or subtracted from one 's attire -- someone who had lived in Armethalieh five hundred years ago could come back and be perfectly at home and comfortable now . And if the High Council continued to govern as it had , someone who would live here five hundred years hence could return and find nothing of note changed . Is that any way to live ? Somehow , that chance encounter with the Inspector had given form to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this place ! That was why he felt as if he was being smothered all the time , why he was so restless and yearned to be anywhere but here ! Abruptly , Kellen changed his mind . He was not going to the Booksellers ' Market . Instead , he would go to the Low Market . Maybe among the discards of generations past he might find something he had n't seen a thousand times . He had n't ever been to the Low Market , where ( it was said ) all the discards of the City eventually ended up . It was in a quarter inhabited by the poorest workers , the street-sweepers , the scullery-help , the collectors of rubbish , the sewer-tenders -- people who had a vested interest in allowing those merchants of detritus to camp on their doorsteps twice a sennight . Yes , he would go there and hope to find something different . And even if he did n't , well , at least being in the Low Market would be something akin to novelty , with the added fillip of knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would be utterly horrified . * * * THERE were no " stalls " as such in the Low Market , and no awnings sheltering goods and merchants , only a series of spaces laid out in chalk on the cobbles of Bending Square . The " square " itself was a lopsided space surrounded by apartment buildings of four and five stories , centered by a public pump . Within each space each would-be merchant was free to display what he or she had for sale in whatever manner he or she chose . No Inspectors ever bothered to come here , and in fact , it was n't even " officially " a market . Some of the sellers laid out a pitiful assortment of trash directly on the stones ; some had dirty , tattered blankets upon which to display their findings ; some presided over a series of wooden boxes through which the customers rummaged . The most prosperous had actual tables , usually with more boxes piled beneath . Kellen stopped before one of these , inspecting the seller 's wares curiously . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just enough silver in the crevices to tell him it had once been plated . The table was heaped with odd metal bric-a-brac , doorknobs , hinges and latches , old keys , tiny dented dishes meant for salt , pewter spoons . " That there 's a knife-rest , sor , " said the ugliest cheerful man -- or the cheerfullest ugly man -- Kellen had ever seen . He picked up the object that Kellen had been examining with puzzlement , a sort of two-headed horse no longer than his finger . " Gentry used to have ' em at dinner , so 's not to soil the cloth when they put their knives down . " He set the object in the middle of a minuscule clear spot , and demonstrated , setting a knife with the blade on the horse 's back and the handle on the table . Well -- something I never heard of ! Kellen thought , pleased . " Fell out of fashion , oh , in my great-great-granddam 's time , " the man continued , looking at the object with fondness , and Kellen conceived an irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish bit of useless paraphernalia to clutter up an already cluttered dinner table , and he wanted it . " How much ? " he asked , and the haggling began . Irrational desire or not , Kellen was n't going to be taken for a gull , if only for the reason that if he paid the asking price , every creature in the market with something to sell would be on him in a heartbeat , determined not to let him go until every coin in his pocket was spent . It was only when the knife-rest was his that Kellen gave it a good look , and discovered it was n't a two-headed horse at all -- but a two-headed unicorn , the horns worn down by much handling to mere nubs . For some reason , the discovery made him feel immensely cheered , and he tucked it in his pocket , determined to have it re-silvered and start using it at dinner . And his father would n't be able to say a word . There were no edicts against reviving an old fashion , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little sculpture rested heavily , but comfortably , in the bottom of his pocket ; it felt like a luck-piece . Maybe I wo n't use it . Maybe I 'll just have it plated and keep it as a charm against boredom . At the farther end of the square , Kellen spotted a bookseller -- one of the prosperous individuals who had tables and boxes of books beneath . The errand that had originally sent Kellen to the Booksellers ' Market had been to find a cheap edition of one of the Student Histories -- Volume Four , Of Armethalieh and Weather , to be precise . Lycaelon 's personal library had one , of course -- how could it not ?  - -  but Kellen wanted one of his own that he could mark up with his own notes in the margins . This was a practice that infuriated his tutor , Anigrel , and frustrated his father , but as long as he did it in his own books , rather than in the pristine volumes in Lycaelon 's library , there was nothing either of them could really say about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well see if there 's one here . It 'll be cheaper , and besides , if it 's full of someone else 's notes from lectures , I might not need to take any of my own . Besides , it might be amusing to read what some other Student had thought of the Histories . He did n't go straight to the bookstall , however , for that would be advertising his interest . Instead , he worked his way down the aisle between the chalk lines , examining a bit of broken clockwork here , a set of mismatched napkins there . It had the same sort of ghoulish fascination as watching the funeral of a stranger , this pawing over the wreckage , the flotsam and jetsam of other people 's lives . Who had torn the sleeves out of this sheepskin jacket , and why ? How had the hand got bitten off this carved wooden doll ? What on earth use was a miniature funeral carriage ? If it was a play-toy , it was certainly a ghoulish one . If those rusty stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound ? People came and went from the apartment buildings surrounding the vendors ; tired and dirty and coming home from their work , or clean and ready for it . One thing living here did guarantee -- that you had a job , a roof over your head , and enough money to feed you . If the roof was a single room and you crammed yourself , your spouse , and half a dozen children into it , well , that was your business and your problem . At least the building was going to be kept in good repair by your City taxes , your spouse and your children could find work to bring in enough to feed all the mouths in the family , and just perhaps one of your kids would turn out to be Gifted and become a Mage -- and support the whole family . Eventually he got to his goal , and feigning complete disinterest , began digging through the books . The bookseller himself looked genuinely disinterested in the possibility of a sale ; from his expression , Kellen guessed that he was suffering either from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in bed . Luck was with him , or perhaps his new little mascot had brought it -- Kellen found not only the Volume Four he was looking for -- in a satisfyingly battered and annotated condition -- but Volumes Five , Six , and Seven , completing the set . They had stiff , pasteboard bindings of the cheapest sort , with the edges of the covers bent and going soft with use and abuse . They looked as if they 'd been used for everything but study , which made them all the more valuable in Kellen 's eyes , for the worse they looked , the less objection Anigrel could have to his marking them up further . And the more Lycaelon would wince when he saw his son with them . I can hear him now --  " We 're one of the First Families of the City , not some clan of rubbish-collectors ! If you must have your own copies to scribble in , for the One 's sake , why could n't you at least have bought a proper set in proper leather bindings ! " And I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words inside any different ? " And of course he 'll throw up his hands and look disgusted . Baiting his father was one of Kellen 's few pleasures , although it had to be done carefully . Pushed too far , Lycaelon could restrict him to the house and grounds , allowing him to leave only to go to his lessons . And an Arch-Mage found enforcing his will a trivial matter -- and one unpleasant for his victim . He was about to get the bookseller 's attention , when a faint hint of gilding caught his eye . It was at the bottom of a pile he 'd dismissed as holding nothing but old ledgers . There were three books there , in dark bindings , and yes , a bit of gilding . Rather out-of-keeping with the rest of these shabby wares . Huh . I wonder what that is -- Whatever it was , the very slender volumes bound in some fine-grained , dark leather , with just a touch of gilt on the spine , seemed worth the effort of investigating . At the worst , they 'd turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades past , and he might find some amusement in the gossip of a previous generation . If he 'd been in a regular bookseller 's stall , Kellen might not have bothered . But ... It might be something interesting . And it 's bound to be cheap . If it was n't a set of journals , the books might even do as a present for his father if the books were in halfway decent shape . An obsessive bibliophile , Lycaelon was always looking for things for his library . Literally anything would do so long as it was n't a book he already had , and his Naming Day Anniversary would be in two moonturns . It would be a bit better than the usual pair of gloves I 've gotten him for the past three years . It took Kellen some work to get down to the three volumes on the bottom of the pile , but when he did , he found himself turning them over in his hands with some puzzlement . There was nothing on the spine of each but a single image -- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing on the cover , not even a bit of tooling , and the covers themselves were in pristine condition -- Odd . Definitely out of keeping with the rest of the wares here . He opened the front covers to the title pages . Handwritten , not printed , title pages ... The Book of Sun . That was the first , and the other two were The Book of Moon and The Book of Stars . Journals after all ? He leafed through the pages , trying to puzzle out the tiny writing . The contents were handwritten as well , and so far from being journal entries , seemingly dealt with magick . They should n't be here at all ! Kellen thought with a sudden surge of glee . They looked like workbooks of some sort , but books on magick were very closely kept , with Students returning their workbooks to their tutors as they outgrew them , and no book on magick that was n't a part of a Mage 's personal library was supposed to leave the grounds of the Mage College at all . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , and they 'd gotten lost , to end up here ? But they were n't any of the recognized Student books , or anything like them , as far as Kellen could tell . The handwriting was neat but so small that the letters danced in front of his eyes , and the way that the letters were formed was unfamiliar to him , slightly slanted with curved finials . But it seemed to him that he recognized those three titles from somewhere . Father be hanged . I want these . Without bothering to look through them any further , he put them on the top of his pile and caught the stall-holder 's eye . The poor fellow , sweating furiously , heaved himself up out of his chair , and got a little more lively when Kellen made only a token gesture at bargaining . Profit , evidently , was the sovereign remedy for what ailed him . He got out a bit of old , scraped paper and even began writing up a bill of sale with the merest stub of a graphite-rod , noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , got younger sibs at home , do you ? " the man asked when he got to the last three special volumes . " No --  " Kellen said , startled by the non sequitur . " Why do you ask ? " " Well , children 's stories --  " The man gestured at Kellen 's three prizes . " I just thought --  " Then he shrugged , wrote down three titles and prices , and handed the receipt to Kellen , who looked down at it in confusion . There were his Student 's Histories , Volumes Four , Five , Six , and Seven -- but what was this ? Tales of the Weald , Fables of Farm and Field , and Hearth-side Stories ? There was nothing like that , nothing like that at all , inside the covers of those three books . He thought quickly . Perhaps he had better go along with this ... " Cousins , " he said briefly , with a grimace , as if he was plagued with a horde of small relatives who needed to be amused . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction , and stuffed the purchases in the carry-bag that Kellen handed to him without a second look . There was something very odd about those books ... and Kellen wanted to get home now , before his father returned from the Council House to plague him , and give them a very close examination . An examination that could be made without any danger of interference . Armethalieh held many magical oddities , but where had he ever heard of a book that could disguise itself ? How was a very interesting question -- but more pressing than that was -- Why ? * * * THE house of Lycaelon Tavadon was not set apart from the street by a wall . It did n't need to be . The two great stone mastiffs on either side of the walkway to the front door were not mere ornaments , but guardians . Anyone not invited , or not belonging to the household , would be ... discouraged from entering . And as one long-ago thief had discovered , a knife has very little effect on a stone dog . Lycaelon 's guardians were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement of walkway , sculptural shrubbery , and guardians , was not particularly large . The back garden was larger , but no more inviting . The former served to isolate the house from the common thoroughfare and as an ornament against the white stone walls of the mansion . The latter -- well , Kellen would have thought that a back garden should be a private place to relax ; a spot insulated and surrounded by greenery , to enjoy a bit of sun away from the prying eyes and the noise of the City . Lycaelon 's back garden , home to tall , dark , somber cypresses planted along the wall , kept it too shaded for that , and far too cold except in the heat of summer when the sun was overhead . No grass grew there ; only careful , somber evergreen plantings in raised beds , separated by gravel , and more statuary , though at least the statuary in the back garden was n't animated . There was nothing to sit on , in any event , except the edges of the beds or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stabbed up at the sky . Not even birds could find anything to like in this place -- though it was possible that , to spare his statues , Lycaelon had worked a little spell to chase the birds away . Kellen carried his burden up the walkway between the stone mastiffs . As he passed them , there was , as ever , the faintest suggestion of movement ; the barest tilt of neck in his direction , the tiniest twitching of stone noses as the household guardians tested him , the hint of the glitter of life in those deeply carved and polished granite eyes . As always , the back of his neck crawled when he passed them . But he refused to go around by the back entrance just because the damned things intimidated him . He hated the sight of them , though -- they were too like the worst aspects of their master , hard and cold , unchangeable and unyielding . The ebony door , inlaid with silver runes , swung open at his touch , and closed behind him without any effort on his part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without ostentatious use of magick at every possible opportunity in the home of a High Mage . And when that High Mage was the head of the Council , well , it was actually more surprising that Lycaelon had human servants at all . He could have done without them , had he chosen to -- but it would have meant a great deal of work on his part . Nothing came for free , after all ; magick servants in the form of simulacra or homunculi were difficult to create and required an endless supply of magick to keep them working . The alternative , literally making dust vanish , food appear , clothes to clean themselves , was even more time and effort-consuming . Lycaelon would dispense with servers if he had an important gathering of his fellow Mages here , animating a single simulacra that he kept on view , serving double-duty the rest of the time as a chaste statue of a shepherd-boy , but with no one here to impress but his son , human servants were cheaper , easily replaced if they gave offense , and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part -- well , the servants knew who they had to please . Lycaelon was generous with his money , but not with forgiveness if anything went wrong . Kellen , however , mattered not at all -- except as Lycaelon ordered . As soon as Kellen set foot in the entryway -- black and white marble floor , the pattern being square-in-square rather than checks , white walls , a few tasteful black plinths with tasteful black urns standing against the walls at aesthetic intervals -- one of the servants materialized , dressed in the household livery of black and white . An oh-so-refined and elegant livery ; hose with one black leg and one white , black half-boots , black , long-sleeved tunic coming to the knee , crisp , white shirt beneath it . The careful , rigid correctness of the man 's expression relaxed a trifle when he saw who it was . " Good afternoon , Kellen , " the servant said . He did not offer to take Kellen 's book-bag from him . There was nothing about Kellen to command fear or respect from the servants , and no real consequences if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would be polite to him . If they were cheeky , it was possible that Lycaelon would come to hear about it , and then they 'd find themselves on the street without references . But they regarded him , Kellen suspected , as a damned nuisance , and did their best to encourage him to stay out of their way as much as possible . Politely , of course . The servant turned and vanished before Kellen could return his greeting . Kellen shrugged , and followed in the man 's footsteps , into the vast and echoing reception room at the end of the entryway . Here the decor was varied a trifle from the stark black and white of the entryway by the addition of two shades of blue . The ceiling was dark blue , with little Magestars glittering above , mimicking the movement of the stars in the night sky . And the three long , low couches and the discreet scattering of chairs were upholstered in satin a slightly paler shade of the same color . All the tables , ornaments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lie down in ) were white or black -- alabaster and ebony . Even the famous simulacrum , standing on ( what else ? ) another black marble plinth , looked like the finest white alabaster . There was n't anything alive in this room ; sometimes the rare female visitor would look about , smile knowingly , and say something about the place needing a " woman 's touch . " Such ladies were never invited back a second time . It was quite true , though , that Kellen could n't remember flowers ever being in the vases , and the air in here never seemed to warm , no matter how the fire in the fireplace roared . There were no apparent doors , no openings into this room , other than the one by which he had just entered . Not even windows ; the light came from glowing panels set high on the walls , which was how anyone who could afford Magelights would generally illuminate a windowless room . The servant was nowhere to be seen , which was no great surprise ; having ascertained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door , he considered his duty discharged . Kellen took a few echoing steps into the reception chamber , then turned right and went straight toward a panel of white marble set in the wall between two blue-and-ebony chairs . At a touch , it dissolved before him and he stepped through and onto a fine , handsome staircase . The panel was keyed to him and other members of the immediate household , of course ; a stranger would still be facing a blank slab of marble . He was now in his own portion of the house ; House Tavadon was a vast mausoleum , and there were probably sections he had never been in and never would have access to until Lycaelon died and the magic doors all opened . He had never been in his father 's wing , for instance , and was n't even quite sure where it was . He could come and go as he liked within his own rooms -- bedroom , separate small library and study , magical workroom , bathroom -- and within the set of public rooms comprising the main library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " public " study -- and he could make free use of the guest quarters , which were in this wing below his rooms , reached by a separate entrance from the reception chamber below . Kellen also knew from experimentation that he could also get into the servants ' quarters and the kitchen , cellars , and storerooms , but he was usually ushered summarily back to the " proper " parts of the Tavadon manse if he was found in any of those areas . And the Chapel , oh , the Light forfend I should forget the Chapel ! The Chapel had a wing all to itself , and differed from the rest of the house in that it was not done in black and white , but in honey alabaster and gold , as befitted the Eternal Light . Such a tasteful Chapel that it was , so pure and refined in style , with the Everburning Flame on a simple altar , and all the niches for the ancestral ashes set into the walls so that no one could ever forget just how many generations of important men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never . Kellen hardly knew for certain how deeply his father believed in the Eternal Light -- but he certainly believed in the name of Tavadon . He climbed the stairs to the third floor , where his own rooms were . Here things were no longer in stark black and white -- in his own suite , he had a certain say in the way things were decorated . The walls were still white , the floors black and white marble again , but there were colorful tapestries on the walls , and fruit in a dish on a plinth beside the top of the stairs , perfuming the air with the scent of apples . He took an apple as he passed it , and got as far as the door to his room , when another servant materialized behind him . " You 'll be having a bath , Kellen ? " said the man -- Kellen did n't know his name ; he was n't encouraged to learn the servants ' names . All women except Cook were " my girl " and all men were " my man . " Lycaelon did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never even known the names of the succession of nursemaids he 'd had as a small child ; they had only been " Nursie , " an endless series of interchangeable middle-aged women with gentle hands and soft voices , the last of which had left when he turned five . Then he 'd been on his own in his rooms , his nights filled with loneliness , his days turned over to a succession of tutors who had schooled him according to his father 's expectations until he had started attending the Mage College at fourteen . Servants tended only to impinge on him when they had orders concerning Kellen . Like the bath . Kellen would have been perfectly happy to do without that bath , but it had not been phrased as a question . This was one of his father 's rules , and there was to be no argument about it -- when one went out into the streets , among the common folk , one had a bath immediately on return . Lycaelon 's abode must not be soiled with the common dust of Armethalieh ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alpine glacier , with no hint of the City outside brought within the walls . " Of course , " he replied with resignation , and left the book-bag just inside the door to his room . At least the fellow would n't touch it if he was n't specifically ordered to-the servants served Lycaelon out of fear and awe rather than loyalty , and seldom did things voluntarily . Lycaelon 's standards were exacting enough to make plenty of work , with no need to look for more of it , Kellen supposed . The bathroom was something he had never figured out how to decorate ; as a result , it was entirely white , entirely marble , and as chill and uninviting as being in the center of a cube of snow . The square marble tub sunk into the floor was already full . The water was , as he had expected , cold . It was always cold . Even in the dead of winter , it was cold . He scarcely remembered what a hot bath felt like -- he had n't had one since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return , no matter how much he wept at night for her . Kellen knew he never got hot water for his bath on purpose , and it was n't only because the servants were disinclined to stir themselves on his behalf . His father felt that this was an incentive to Kellen 's mastering his lessons so that he could heat his own bathwater with magick -- as Lycaelon probably did . And Kellen was just stubborn enough that even if he had mastered magick enough to heat the water , he might not have done it , just out of spite . Well , at least after a long walk followed by the three-story climb , a cold bath was n't as much of an ordeal as usual . But it certainly did n't make one inclined to linger ... * * * RECLOTHED -- in the fresh and considerably more ornate garments the servant had left for him -- Kellen was still shivering when he closed the door of his room and unpacked his book-bag . His father would n't be home for bells , Kellen knew from long experience . Lycaelon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home most of the time . He usually left after a leisurely breakfast , but often did n't return until well into Night Bells . And now that the tub had been drained , Kellen would n't see a servant in his suite unless he called for one . He was more or less used to being alone most of the time when he was n't studying , but now and again , it felt eerily as if everyone in the world had forgotten his existence . Sometimes Kellen fantasized that he himself was like a mouse wandering through a giant machine , which would run just the same whether he was there or not . It seemed to him that nothing he ever did made any real mark on the place -- that House Tavadon existed for empty display and heartless show , and was less a home than an extension of one of Arme-thalieh 's great public buildings , or Temples of the Light . Or just a bigger version of Lycaelon 's simulacrum-servant . Although other rooms in this suite had only been opened up for him as he grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for as long as he could remember . It had begun as his nursery , with his Nursie sleeping in the same room , or the one adjoining . His cradle had been here , and the box-bed that prevented his falling out as a toddler . The tapestries on the wall covered whitewashed plaster that had been laid over the painted animals of his childhood . The floor was wood , not marble , and brown , not black . The wardrobe , the bed , the chests and bookcases , all were the same pieces he 'd had since he was a boy , all were fine pieces , but plain -- expensive , but an honest golden brown , not black , not white , and just a little battered by hard use at the hands of an active child . Thick , brightly patterned rugs were on the floor , multicolored cushions were piled in a corner , and there was a single window that looked out on the street . He could see out , but due to the same magic that hid the passages from the reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could see in . His fireplace was of reasonable size , and when it was not in use , it held scented candles that he had selected for himself in the Perfumers ' Market . This was the only room in the house that he ever felt warm in . He never felt entirely undisturbed here , not since the day that he 'd found one of the servants clearly rummaging through his wardrobe , but at least he could relax to a certain extent here . Lycaelon might send servants in here to spy , but he never troubled to come himself . For a moment Kellen paused in his unpacking . He 'd forgotten about the servants , and the way they periodically went through his belongings and reported the results to his father . How was he going to hide those books -- Then he laughed . Stupid ! They 're going to hide themselves , of course . These books clearly did n't show their true nature to just anyone . Probably only a Mage would see them for what they were -- and there were only three Mages that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three , two , Lycaelon and Anigrel , never entered this room . So he put his new acquisitions in with the old , battered storybooks from his nursery days . If they 'd disguised themselves as children 's stories before , they probably would again . No one would ever notice that there were three more books on that shelf than there had been before . What he wanted to do was to open the books then and there and try to read them -- but there were rules in the house of Arch-Mage Lycaelon , and one of those rules was that of routine and schedule . He heard the sound of Noontide Bells begin to ring -- the high clear note of the crystal bell of the Temple of the Light struck first , followed by the bells of the other towers in the City , and last of all the great bronze bell atop the Council House added its deep note to the chorus . A blind man could tell time -- and even the season of the year -- in Armethalieh , for the intricate pattern of her bells told the hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only towers that rang all the bells were the Temple of the Light and the Council House . You could actually tell which bell of the day it was by the sound of the ring : at Midnight Bells , only those two rang together , making a beautiful and eerie sound . At Evensong , Noontide , and Morning Bells ( a few bells later than actual dawn , fortunately for light sleepers ) , all the towers in the City rang out . And at every bell and season , the pattern changed : it was one of the duties of the Mage Council to set the towers by magic . From Evensong until Midnight Bells , fewer and fewer towers would ring each bell , until the Temple and the Council House rang alone . Then , slowly , a few privileged towers would add their voices to each bell through the rest of the night -- first the Mage College , then the Great Library , then the Merchants ' Guild -- until all the towers throughout the City rang out Morning Bells , as they would ring each bell throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they began to fall silent . By the sound of the bells -- the pattern of the ring would have told him it was the Noontide Bells , even if he had n't been able to see the sun -- and by the emptiness of his stomach , Kellen knew it was time for dinner . Even though the Arch-Mage himself might not be home for it , dinner would be served . And if Kellen wanted anything to eat before supper , he 'd better be there when the plates went on the table . Just as he left his room , the soft gong that announced that very fact sounded through the corridors . Down the stairs and out into the reception chamber he went , and from there to another blank panel that let him into the main part of the house . When Lycaelon entertained , this panel was left open , and the suite of enormous " public " rooms beyond it , a music room , the library , the dining room , and a garden room were all lit and furnished with anything that a guest could conceivably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with curtains drawn , except for the dining room at the very end of the corridor . The same color scheme of black , white , and blue held here . The enormous ebony table , stretching the length of the room , could easily seat thirty or forty guests ; there were two place settings laid as usual . One at the very head of the table was meant for Lycaelon -- he appeared only rarely , but woe betide the servants if they were n't prepared for that eventuality !  - -  the other , roughly halfway down the table , for Kellen . A series of covered dishes waited on the sideboard ; a single liveried servant stood there , waiting to serve them . In silence , Kellen took his seat , and the meal began . One by one the dishes were presented to Kellen , and he either shook his head or nodded acceptance . Hot food stayed hot , and cold nicely chilled , thanks to more small magicks on the depressions in which the dishes rested . Kellen 's bath might be cold , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas he did share Kellen 's meals . Lycaelon spared no effort or expense when it came to the pleasures of the table . Kellen ate with a good appetite , and was not particularly surprised to find that the meal ended with a dish of strawberries , beaten cream , and white cake . He helped himself , thinking wryly that if he 'd looked closely at the mob in the Garden Market this morning he might well have seen his father 's black-and-white livery on one of the servants there . The entire meal took place in total silence , except for the faint clink of cutlery and the sounds of plates being picked up and set down . Kellen was used to it ; even when his father was here , there was no conversation during a meal . Lycaelon did not believe in conversation at mealtime . He had to put up with it when he entertained , but when he and Kellen were alone , silence prevailed . And certainly in Lycaelon 's absence , Lycaelon 's servants would not presume to begin any conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair away from the table and left the footman to clear up . The library -- I should go look through the books in the library , he thought . I 'll bet that 's where I found those references to my books . If I go check now , I should have plenty of time to look in the likeliest places long before Father gets home . Books that hid their nature ... Lycaelon apparently had never even noticed that Kellen used his library on a regular basis . I think I 'd like to keep things that way , too , he thought as he walked in through the library door and headed straight for the curtains , to pull them wide and let pale sunshine stream in through the windows . In fact , he had been reading the books on magick for a very long time now -- and he was at least familiar with a great deal more than his father or Anigrel suspected , even if he could n't yet manage to put his knowledge into practice . And I know things that neither of them want anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , pulling one of the ladders over to the bookcase that housed some very esoteric volumes on the top shelves -- volumes that , had Lycaelon or anyone else known he was poking around in the place , would surely have been removed or locked up . There were a lot of things on those shelves that were not meant for a Student 's eyes . It did n't take long at all for Kellen to find what he was looking for , because the more he thought about his finds , the more convinced he became that they were books that were hiding their nature for a very good reason . Sure enough , he found the reference precisely where he 'd begun to suspect it was , in the Ars Perfidorum , the Book of Forbidden Acts . Kellen was n't even supposed to be aware that the Ars Perfidorum existed , much less have leafed through it . For that matter , he did n't even think his tutor was supposed to know about it ; knowledge of this particular book was , if he recalled correctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the reason Kellen knew that was because Lycaelon had once allowed one of his fellow Council members to use the library , and the fellow had carelessly left the Ars Perfidorum and two other similarly restricted books out in the music room where he had been reading them . The resulting explosion when Lycaelon found them there had been memorable . Lycaelon had not been aware that Kellen was anywhere about , and the entertainment value of hearing his father swear and curse the stupidity of another adult -- a High Mage at that ! had been so great that Kellen took his chances on being caught in order to eavesdrop . He made very sure to get back to his own rooms as soon as the coast was clear -- but after that he 'd been afire to find those books and see them for himself . He vividly recalled his disappointment at finding them to be deadly dull . It had seemed to him that a book with such an exciting title should have been full of horrors -- bloodcurdling examples of Forbidden Acts , in excruciating detail , so that Mages down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act when they saw it . In fact , Ars Perfidorum was a mealymouthed prude of a book , more intent on outlining the punishments to be meted out for each perfidious deed than describing the deeds themselves . It was -- it was a clerkly sort of book , and sent him off into a near-doze when he tried to read it . Maybe I thought that book was dull then , he thought , swiftly leafing through the text , but that was before anybody shoved the History of the City in Seven Volumes under my nose -- hah ! There they were -- just as he remembered . His three books -- titles and all . He leafed back a page . " The Foule and Invidious Practices of Wilde Magick . " Now what in the name of the Light is that supposed to mean ? Kellen wondered , frowning . The chapter in question did n't exactly answer any of his questions , although Ye Boke of Sunne , Ye Boke of Moone , and Ye Boke of Starres were named as the " prime texts of the heinous practitioners of those who seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that single item of hard fact , the chapter was singularly unhelpful . It railed at great length against the " Wilde Mages , " suggested any number of unpleasant means to deal with them , and attributed all manner of evils to them ( always prefacing the accusation with the words " it is said " ) but it did n't say anything about what this " Wilde Magick " was , or why it should be so bad . In fact , the worst accusations that the author seemed to be able to come up with were that it was unpredictable , that it could not be controlled , and that some of the so-called lesser races such as Centaurs and fauns were known to practice it . " And well we knowe that these creatures are closer to the Beaste in nature than to Noble Manne --  " Huh . " And in particular , Wilde Magick is the greatest seducer of Womyn , who are weak in Mind and Spirit and inclined to Corruption . " Now what did that mean ? That women could and did use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hmm ... Now there was a possibility that had all manner of pleasant ramifications ... Well , at least he knew now what the books were , and why they were passing themselves off as children 's tales . He put the Ars Perfidorum back in its proper place , taking care that it fit exactly into the place where he 'd pulled it down from , then moved the ladder back to where he 'd found it . It looked as if the only place he was going to find any answers about the books was within their covers . He grinned to himself . And what good luck that he had the entire rest of the day free ! I got just what I wished for , Kellen thought with glee , something new -- something new -- at last ! * * * NIGHT had fallen over the City while Kellen puzzled his way through the Books ' peculiar crabbed handwriting in the safety of his room , although it was never really dark here . Lamps , magickal and otherwise , kept the darkness at bay all night long , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens ; lamps even lit alleyways to discourage the presence of thieves . Not that anyone would be foolish enough to attempt to rob the household of a Mage of any sort . Not twice , anyway . He 'd skimmed through all three of the Books once quickly , finding little that made sense to him . The Book of Sun was composed partly of philosophy , partly of spells , but the spells were not of a kind that he recognized , and Kellen was doubtful that they could actually work . They seemed to verge on wondertale superstition . Burn this leaf . Say those rhymes . He could imagine nothing further from the abstruse disciplines of the High Magick . But at least The Book of Sun did contain things Kellen recognized as magick . The Book of Moon did n't even seem to contain any actual spells , just hints at spells -- as far as he could tell from a quick skim , it was something halfway between an etiquette book and a philosophy text -- and The Book of Stars made no sense to him at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something there , if he could only figure it out . The house was utterly silent , with all of the household in bed , from which comfort no one would stir until they had to . That Lycaelon was a stern master was no secret ; he did not approve of his servants " prowling , " as he put it , during the bells of proper sleep . This included Kellen , of course , and after having been caught by Lycaelon once or twice , he kept to his own part of the mansion when restlessness kept him awake . Tonight was one of those nights . He had his shutters open on the small balcony that overlooked the gardens , and across the gardens he could see the lights of the other homes of the Mage elite . Soft globes of pastel colors lit their gardens -- you could tell where one garden took over from the next by the color of the lamps . Only a few lights were burning in the homes themselves , and those were probably night-lights , not an indication that anyone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council House , facing the Delfier Gate that opened onto the forest road . The Council House stood symbolic guard over the gate and access into the City . Or was it more than merely symbolic ? There were a few farming villages in that direction -- the City claimed extensive lands outside itself . Certainly soldiers were sent out there , and tax collectors , the latter to feed the City 's prosperity , and the former -- perhaps to ensure the City 's prosperity ? But Kellen had never been there , and emigration between village and City was strongly discouraged , or so he 'd been told , though never why . He could understand why the Council would n't want too many people trying to move into the City ; conditions were crowded enough without adding more people . But why keep citizens from leaving if they wanted to ? It was a puzzle for which he had no answer . Unless it was simply that City-dwellers had few , if any , skills that would be of use in a rural or agrarian society . Perhaps the idea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't people be allowed to learn this for themselves ? If would-be City-folk-turned-rustics came trailing back with their tails between their legs after failing some bucolic experiment to the ridicule of their former neighbors , surely that would be more effective than any reprimand from the Council . The Council House itself was ablaze with light , for Mages worked there all night , every night , weaving spells for the good of the City . It was the only place in the City that never slept . Of course , all those lights so nearby meant that the stars were hard to see from the gardens of those living nearby . Someday Kel len would spend his nights there too , if his father 's plans for his future went according to Lycaelon 's oft-expressed wishes . A night owl by nature , that had n't seemed so bad in the past , for he would be well out of Lycaelon 's purview most of the time once he went to night duties -- but for some reason now , the thought seemed stifling . As stifling as the High Magick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finicking obsession with detail that , applied to anything else , would be considered unhealthy . Kellen had come to realize of late that High Magick was boring , that -- once certain tools of memory and power manipulation were mastered -- it was entirely composed of written spells that were descriptions of the change in reality that the Mage would like to produce . Very exact descriptions , very minute descriptions , down to the smallest detail , written in a kind of mystical shorthand and forced into the face of reality-as-it-was by magickal power . Frankly , if the simple spells were enough to induce yawns , the advanced spells that he 'd managed to glimpse looked to Kellen a very great deal like abstruse mathematical problems expressed in words and symbols of the sort that drove schoolboys mad --  " If A leaves his house on the corner of Bodhran Street and approaches Taman Square at the same time B --  " Learning how to read , write , and thoroughly comprehend this sigil-language and apply it to the world in the form of memorized spells was what the Mage-in-training first learned . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was bloodless and terribly boring , when it came right down to it . There was so much preparation and memorization and detail required to do even the simplest thing that by the time you actually accomplished what you 'd set out to do , you were probably so bored with the process that the accomplishment came as an anticlimax . And in any case , the tiny things Kellen was allowed to do now -- and so far , all he 'd managed to do successfully was light a candle once or twice -- were so simple and so insignificant that he hardly knew why anyone had ever bothered to write down the spells for them . He looked out at the City , looked at what little he could see beyond the City walls from his third-floor balcony , and it gradually came over him that not only was he not happy , but for most of his life , save only a few stolen moments , he had never been happy . Other people were happy -- why was n't he ? Why was n't any Mage , really ? He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father was Arch-Mage , the highest and most powerful rank any Mage could attain . But Lycaelon was perpetually dissatisfied . When was the last time he 'd ever seen his father enjoy anything ? Other than finding an excuse to browbeat his son , that is ... And none of Lycaelon 's colleagues seemed any more content with their lives , even though they had wealth and power and the envy of everyone in the City who was n't them . When was the last time he 'd seen any of the Mages take pleasure in anything , other than humiliating one another ? Being a Mage does n't make you happy , Kellen realized with something very much like fear . He 'd never thought about it before . He hated the lessons , was bored by the memorization , and did n't like his fellow Mage Students very much . But he 'd always , well , sort of assumed that he 'd get through all of it somehow , become a Mage , and things would get better . What if they did n't ? Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted his own life , and the prospects for the future , and he did n't like what he saw . And the more he pondered it , the less he liked it , and he began to come to some uncomfortable conclusions . One of which was that his studies were going to drive him mad before too long , all this obsession with pointless detail . He brooded on the view without seeing it , wondering why anyone would choose to be a Mage when a Mage had so little room in his life for life . If he did as Lycaelon wanted , Kellen would only trade the stultifying life of a Student-Apprentice for the tedious life of an Apprentice , and then for an even more restrictive and obsessive life of a Journeyman , and then what ? Spend his entire life like his father , with a fantastic home he never saw , a garden he never went into , possessions he never used , and colleagues -- not friends -- he could n't stand ? Was he to live a life so measured , so controlled , that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appalled by the prospect of becoming like one of them -- with a dry little mummified excuse for a soul , spending his days contriving ways to control other people 's lives for them , his evenings spent building baroque and convoluted spells , or equally baroque and convoluted schemes for the downfall of his political rivals . Where was the joy , the life , the pleasure in that ? There had to be some other alternative ... His mind turned naturally to the Books of the Wild Magic , which seemed , from the little he 'd managed to understand so far , to be all that the High Magick was not . And if they were -- if they were , in fact , the very opposite of High Magick -- it would be very surprising indeed to find that Lycaelon looked upon them with favor ... Furthermore , there might , there just might be something in them that would lead him to freedom . And that alone decided him . He got them from his hiding place , lit a single , well-shielded candle , and began to read The Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
