<p> The camera does n't lie , but it does raise a troubling question : As human beings are treated like animals , why is this " girl next door " smiling ? <p> That question continues to haunt a disbelieving American public which in April gasped to see a photo of GI Lynndie England cheerily leading around a naked Iraqi prisoner on a leash at Abu Ghraib prison . Apparently ordinary guys , too , posed - with smiles - beside men they 'd allegedly beaten and piled high in a pyramid to get them to talk . Just following orders , some said , yet the question remains : Why such happy faces ? <p> Psychologists , theologians , and a journalist who researched war for years hold that , under certain conditions , otherwise ordinary people can be susceptible to adopting a warped mentality in which they take pleasure in another 's suffering - also known as sadism . <p> What , exactly , causes some people to engage in sadistic behavior is something of a mystery , they say . But most cite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - awash in feelings of duty , camaraderie , and revenge - sometimes lose the moral compass that guided their behavior in their former lives . <p> Two main theories abound on such cruelty : One is that war can make good people callous , even sinister ; the other is that everyone already is a bit cruel , and war just tends to bring out the worst of it . <p> The fiery emotions of war and a foreign environment can conspire to lower moral inhibitions , says one psychologist who has studied people 's justifications for evil and violent behavior . In extreme cases , they may even transform honorable young men and women into hardened characters who can induce pain without remorse . <p> " Personalities can become quite different , " says Arthur Miller , a Miami University ( Ohio ) social psychologist and editor of the new book " The Social Psychology of Good and Evil . " " As you victimize other people , you convince yourself you 're doing a good thing or else you go crazy . When this person returns , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Others , however , say extreme conditions can bring to the fore irascible tendencies common to some young adults , and the mission in war - to get the job done - might at times cause a certain degree of sadism . <p> " You 've got to see the enemy as less than human , " says Lance Morrow , a former Time Magazine journalist who interviewed Serbian warlords for his 2003 book " Evil : An Investigation . " " Glee expresses your power . The glee evident at Abu Ghraib is part of a parading of power over powerlessness . It 's aimed at breaking down the suspect by giving them a sense of powerlessness ... But glee in wartime also covers up fear . " <p> Mr. Morrow regards soldiers ' conduct at Abu Ghraib as " terrible " and " stupid " but not " evil , " since he says these humiliation tactics hardly rival the ruthless killing sprees he observed in Rwanda or Bosnia in the 1990s . In fact , stories of warriors who enjoy inflicting torture have dotted accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spying eye of a camera - and its strange ability to forge a smile anytime - is relatively new . <p> Nonetheless , incidents documented at Abu Ghraib do constitute " sadism , " according to other sources for this story , and might shed light on a seldom-studied side of human behavior . <p> As for the ordinary person 's propensity for sadism , psychologists have no choice but to cite studies dating from 25 years ago . That 's because ethical regulations have for decades prohibited researchers from encouraging cruel behavior or even a simulation of it . The result is a dearth of fresh data to explain how sadistic behavior can become habitual for other- wise good people , as the multitude of theories in psychology and elsewhere can attest . <p> James Waller , social psychologist at Whitman College and author of " Becoming Evil : How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing , " says soldiers called upon to humiliate the enemy must either learn to relish the task or run the risk of being paralyzed by guilt . <p> " The victim dehumanization process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Waller says . " It becomes easier for them to do what they do if they buy into the justification that this person fully deserves what they 're getting . In fact , in this alternative moral universe , it would be an act of injustice not to belittle and abuse them . " <p> Getting to that point , Waller says , depends on accepting rhetoric that equates the enemy with vermin - in this case , perceiving them as terrorists who measure up as sub-human and worthy of annihilation . Yet even with such ample rhetoric in mind , he says , a person may hesitate until he or she completes a first act of brutality , which " opens a floodgate " of base human behavior . <p> Crossing that threshold , which can seem unthinkable from an outside perspective , tends to occur when an individual feels bound to a group and compelled to adhere to group standards , Dr. Miller says . He cites a 1960s study in which Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram showed that ordinary people , when instructed by an authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a stranger . Another study by Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University in 1971 ended abruptly because subjects , simulating prison guards , " became sadistic . " <p> Still , the mystery lingers : Why the enjoyment in watching others suffer ? Perhaps glee merely covers up fear or shame beneath the pressures of war . But theologians quickly cast the indictment wider . Some see humankind perpetually struggling with a dark desire to wish enemies humiliated and to laugh when they are . <p> Even a professor of moral theology knows the sadistic impulse from personal experience . Thomas Massaro of Weston Jesuit School of Theology recalls driving in the Bronx years ago when another driver cut him off . Further up the road , he saw the same driver had crashed into a pole . His first reaction was gleeful : " At least for a minute , I said , ' Ha ! I hope he has expensive damage to his car ! ' " <p> Professor Massaro soon repented for wishing another ill , but not before gaining a new insight : The thirst for revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " These are inmates suspected of having shot at US soldiers , " Massaro says . " These guards at Abu Ghraib could have had friends killed by these enemies . " To resist the desire to degrade and dehumanize is the moral imperative , he says , but doing so in certain settings requires an uncommonly steely will . <p> Some personalities , too , might be more prone to sadism than others , psychologists suggest . To reduce the likelihood of sadism among its prison guards , Maryland uses a personality inventory to screen out those with " a tendency to do bad things and nasty things , " says William Sondervan , former Maryland commissioner of corrections and now director of professional development for the American Correctional Association . <p> Even after a screening , however , tensions can lead to temptations . In Maryland 's rural prisons , 77 percent of inmates are African-Americans from urban areas , while 99 percent of guards are whites from the local vicinity . When an HIV-positive inmate splashes a guard with his urine , blood , or feces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take pleasure in striking back . But those who ca n't control that impulse are reprimanded or fired . <p> " People who do those things tend to get weeded out , " Sondervan says . <p> In military settings such as Abu Ghraib , however , staffing shortages can preclude the luxury of personality screening - and sadistic behavior can result . People who have a high opinion of themselves but feel easily threatened are quickest to become enraged and to delight in seeing the offender suffer , Miller says . " Then you have the mix that can really be devastating . " <p> Whether personality is a major factor in manifesting sadism among ordinary people is a matter of debate . Waller , for one , questions whether personality should even be considered as a factor . <p> Not everyone , sources agree , will succumb even to the strongest pressures to behave sadistically . Army soldier Joseph Darby , who reported the abuse at Abu Ghraib to his commander , chose to resist even though it meant he might be labeled a traitor . Yet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of security may have lessened the vigilance against cruelty . <p> " After 9/11 , there came a mentality that said , ' We can not afford to be nice . We have to do whatever it takes to find these people and bring down Osama bin Laden , ' " Morrow says . " It seems to me that this is the atmosphere where these things may occur .
