LIFE ON THE CHESAPEAKE IN BLACK AND WHITE // When Harriet Tubman fled her dead master 's family in 1849 , she was not the only slave from the Eastern Shore of Maryland racing for liberty . In 1850 a total of 279 runaway slaves earned Maryland the dubious distinction of leading the slave states in successfully executed escapes . The motivations for running away are no mystery ; however , in many cases the methods of escape remain unknown even to this day . Despite stepped-up efforts in Maryland and other southern states to thwart escapes during the ten years before the Civil War , some slaves did marshal the strength and courage to take their liberty . But few returned to the land of their enslavers , risking capture and reenslavement , even lynching , to help others seek their own emancipation . // How did Tubman successfully escape bondage in Dorchester County , and how did she manage to return many times to lead out family and friends ? Not merely the recipient of white abolitionist support , Tubman was the beneficiary of , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control of white Marylanders , from the earliest Africans brought from Africa to the outbreak of the Civil War . // Tubman 's story begins several decades before her birth with a complicated set of interrelationships , black and white , enslaved and free , of several generations of families living on the Eastern Shore of Maryland . As historian Mechal Sobel describes it , this was a " world they made together . " // Dorchester County lies between two rivers , the Choptank to the north and the Nanticoke to the south and east , and extends from the Chesapeake Bay to the Delaware state line , encompassing almost 400,000 acres of dense forest full of oak , hickory , pine , walnut , and sweet gum ; marshes and waterways ; and extensive farmland . Numerous navigable rivers and creeks crisscross the county , offering access to trade and suitable sites for shipbuilding . The flat terrain provides abundant tillable lands for tobacco , wheat , corn , fruit , and other agricultural products , and before modern times , the vast supply of oyster shells helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Delaware line , flowing south between Caroline and Talbot Counties and on to Dorchester County , finally emptying into the Chesapeake . In the nineteenth century , the river remained navigable for nearly forty miles upstream from the Chesapeake Bay . Dorchester 's southern border , the Nanticoke River , was navigable throughout its course from Seaford , Delaware , to the Chesapeake ; the town of Vienna served as its port of entry and be- came a major trading center during the early nineteenth century , providing bay access to neighboring Somerset County and southwestern Delaware . // It was to this landscape that Harriet Tubman 's African ancestors were forcibly brought to labor in servitude to white masters . Enslavement of Africans in Maryland , and the laws and regulations that codified slavery 's existence , evolved slowly over a hundred-year period . Until the early eighteenth century white indentured servitude was common , particularly on the Eastern Shore . Some planters had both slaves and indentured servants ; by the 1730s and 1740s , however , shipments of black captives from Africa to the Americas had increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves , including ones specifying that any children born to an enslaved woman would carry the status of the mother , with ownership remaining with the slave woman 's owner , even if the father was a free black or a white man . // Thus Tubman 's story begins with the history of some of the white families who claimed ownership of her and her family . The detailed records of the lives of the white families who enslaved Tubman , her family , and her friends , demonstrate the sharp contrast between the lives of whites and blacks , lives intimately entwined yet irreconcilably different . Following these white families ' lives as closely as the remaining records allow reveals the lives of their enslaved people , bringing to life the web of community into which Tubman was born . The white Pattisons , the Thompsons , the Stewarts , and the Brodesses played key roles in the lives of Tubman 's family . On the Eastern Shore of Maryland , most black people , slave and free alike , moved around according to the land ownership patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white families . Out of necessity , many black families maintained familial and community ties throughout a wide geographic area . Family separations were not always precipitated by sale ; some whites owned ( or rented ) land and farms across great distances , requiring a shifting of their enslaved and hired black labor force at varying times throughout the year , or at various times over a period of decades when new land had been purchased and the cycle of clearing and establishing new farms began . This pattern of intraregional movement forced families and friends ( both black and white ) to create communication and travel networks in order to maintain ties with family and community . These complicated networks made it possible for Tubman to become one of the rare individuals capable of executing successful and daring rescues repeatedly . // A devastating fire at the Dorchester County courthouse , set by an unknown arsonist in May 1852 , destroyed a great portion of Dorchester County 's historical records . Because few records survived from before 1852 , piecing together the nature of black and white relationships in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , we do not know the names of all the slaves owned by Edward Brodess , Harriet Tubman 's owner , nor all of those owned by Anthony Thompson , the owner of Tubman 's father , Ben Ross , from the first half of the nineteenth century . // Several documents did survive the fire : the records of the Orphans Court from 1847 to 1852 were saved because the clerk of the court brought the logbook home to work on it over the weekend . This quirk of fate secured a five-year segment of history important to revealing details of Tubman 's life and of those black and white families who were part of her community . Other records were saved , too : the books listing manumissions , freedom papers , and many chattel records ( where slave sales were recorded ) were preserved , providing important information about the black community and vital genealogical data for many families in the area . District court cases , heard at the appeals court located in neighboring Talbot County , were recorded at the state level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the colonial era and the early republic . Fortunately , these court records contain some of the most dramatic documentation available detailing Harriet Tubman 's life in slavery . // Reaching Beyond the Grave : The Legacy of a Patriarch // In 1791 Atthow Pattison , the patriarch of a long-established Eastern Shore family , sat down to contemplate his legacy to his children and grandchildren . A Revolutionary War veteran , a modest farmer , and an even more modest slaveholder , Pattison could proudly trace his roots in Dorchester County back at least a century . Intermarrying for generations , the Pattisons and other Eastern Shore families consolidated their control over vast tracts of dense timberland , rich marshlands , and productive farms . // Standing at his front door , Pattison could view much of his approximately 265-acre farm , situated on the east side of the Little Blackwater River , near its confluence with the larger Blackwater River . From the wharf in front of his home Pattison probably shipped tobacco , timber , and grain , destined for England and other markets , and received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other trading points in New England and along the Chesapeake. // After dividing tracts of land , including his home plantation , and arranging for payments to his grandchildren when they came of age , Atthow bequeathed his remaining slaves and livestock to his surviving daughter , Elizabeth , and her children , Gourney Crow , James , Elizabeth , Achsah , and Mary Pattison , and to his son-in-law , Ezekiel Keene , and his children , Samuel and Anna Keene . Elizabeth , in keeping with her father 's implicit understanding that his children marry " in the family , " had married her cousin William Pattison , and they lived on a nearby plantation . Atthow 's second daughter , Mary , had married her cousin Ezekiel Keene and moved to a farm south of Atthow 's land , though she was dead by the time the will was written . // When Atthow Pattison died in January 1797 he gave to his granddaughter Mary Pattison one enslaved girl named " Rittia and her increase until she and they arrive to forty five years of age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's terms of service to forty-five years , provided for Rit 's eventual manumission , or freedom , from slavery . Maryland manumissions had taken place even in the earliest days of slavery . Never an informal procedure , manumissions were taken quite seriously and were often recorded in land records ( as deeds ) for each county . Some slaves were able to earn enough money to buy their own freedom , and on occasion slaves sued for their freedom , some eventually prevailing . In 1752 Maryland passed a law restricting manumission by will to slaves " sound in body and mind , capable of labor and not over fifty years of age , " so as to prevent slaveholders or estates from avoiding responsibility for the care and maintenance of " disabled and superannuated slaves . " Manumitting slaves was illegal if the grant of manumission was written in part " during the last fatal illness of the master , " or if the freeing of slaves affected the ability of creditors to settle their claims against the estate of the deceased . This legislation , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hold slaveholders more accountable for the support and maintenance of indigent slaves . // Limiting Rit 's term of service lowered her market value to Pattison 's heirs if they were inclined to sell her after gaining possession of her . No doubt Pattison was aware of this , but he may have been influenced by the spirit of the times . On the Eastern Shore , as elsewhere in the new nation , a complex movement was emerging , both religious and secular , that spurred a marked increase in manumissions during the 1790s . While elite families still maintained much control , wealth could be achieved readily with the expanding production of wheat and other grains for export markets , providing viable roads to prosperity for entrepreneurial families in Dorchester and the surrounding counties . The rise of intensive grain agriculture and timber harvesting transformed work patterns on the Eastern Shore . Tobacco production required a year-round labor force , but grain agriculture did not . While timber harvesting could be carried on throughout the year , it also required continuous acquisition of land once one lot had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . These factors , among others , altered the nature of black slavery and freedom on the Eastern Shore by 1800 ; on one hand , free black labor became , to some extent , a more attractive economic alternative to owning slaves , while on the other hand , some white slaveholders found it lucrative to sell off their excess slaves . //
