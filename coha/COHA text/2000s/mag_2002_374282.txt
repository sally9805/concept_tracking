Coleen Rowley became enamored with the FBI 's fictionalized ideal long before she heard of the real thing . Her favorite show was The Man from U.N.C.L.E. , a spy spoof about two debonair agents who work to save the world from evil . In the fifth grade , Rowley wrote to the show 's producers , asking to join the cadre of supersecret spies . She got a rejection letter . " They said it did n't exist , " Rowley remembers . " But they told me that in the United States , we had something called the FBI . And they gave me the address . " So Rowley wrote to the bureau and received a pamphlet titled " 99 Facts About the FBI . " One question was , " Does the FBI employ women as special agents ? " The answer was no . Even then , she did not scare easily . " I thought to myself , That 's stupid . I figured that would change eventually . " <P> Last May , when Rowley upbraided her beloved FBI in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not about speaking truth to power , because people like Rowley do n't see much difference between the two . Truth is power  --  that 's how you catch the bad guys . <P> So the memo  --  the one that leaked and landed her on the front pages of newspapers , that brought her to Washington to face cameras and Congressmen and that helped set off the debate over how to reinvent the FBI  --  was not meant to be a memo at all . It came tumbling out , almost by accident , because she could n't hold the words inside anymore . <P> Since Sept. 11 , the 48-year-old had muzzled her grief about the bureaus failures  --  specifically , about how it ignored cries from her office to take seriously the case of Zacarias Moussaoui , a French-Moroccan who spoke poor English and had signed up at a local flight school , keen to fly a 747 . Eight months after the attacks , Rowley and others got a chance to tell what they knew . Staff members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington for a private interview . <P> " Initially , I just started writing down points that I did n't want to miss when I was going to do my interview , " she says . " I went to bed Wednesday night and was up all night , saying , ' Oh ! I 've got to remember to say this , got to remember that . ' Thursday night I went to bed thinking , man , am I tired . Well , I could n't sleep all night long . The same type of thing . I 've got to remember this and remember that . " About 2:30 a.m . Friday , Rowley had had enough . I said , " This is ridiculous . I 'm on 36 hours without sleep . If I jot it down , first of all I wo n't forget it . And I wo n't have to keep reminding myself of things to say . I 'll get it out of my system , and I 'll be able to sleep . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
