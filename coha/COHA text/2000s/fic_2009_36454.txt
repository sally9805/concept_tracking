I barrel through the double doors and across the lobby of the State Department , bypassing the metal detector and waving my plastic identification badge at the guard , who nods in recognition . My heels echo off the marble floor as I race down the corridor past the row of brightly colored flags , the tall glass windows revealing smokers huddled under umbrellas in the courtyard . A display of student artwork left over from Black History Month decorates the otherwise drab white walls . <p> I reach the elevators and press the up button . In an office across the hall , two jacketless , gray-haired men wearing identical brown ties lean over a cubicle divider discussing Cuba , their voices dispassionate and unhurried . A dying fluorescent lightbulb flickers angrily in the ceiling fixture above them . I turn back and press the button several more times , tapping my foot . The smell of scorched coffee , an empty pot left too long on the burner , hangs in the air . The door creaks open and I leap into the elevator , swiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button . Do n't stop , I pray , leaning sideways against the faux wood paneling and watching the numbers light up as the elevator slowly rises . <p> A minute later , the door opens . I step out , then pause , momentarily forgetting my haste . August and imposing , the executive floor is worlds away from the bureaucratic lethargy below . Oil paintings of every secretary of state since Jefferson line the tastefully lit beige walls , staring down at me sternly , reminding me to stand straight . Large potted plants sit to either side of the elevator bank . <p> Steeling myself for the conversation I am about to have , I turn away from the closed double doors that lead to the Secretary 's office , following the chronological progression of gold-framed portraits down the navy-carpeted hallway . At John Calhoun , I stop and adjust my collar before turning the knob of a familiar , broad oak area before the stout , auburn-haired secretary can try to stop me . I knock twice on an unmarked door at the far end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want London , " I announce . <p> Behind the massive oak desk , Paul Van Antwerpen looks up from the cable he was reading and blinks once behind his glasses . <p> " Oh ? " he replies , raising his eyebrows and running his hand through his thinning hair . <p> I hesitate . For the normally impassive Van Antwerpen , this is quite a reaction . He is surprised , I can tell , by the abruptness of my entrance as well as the nature of my request . The senior director of intelligence operations is a formal man ; one schedules appointments to see him and does so sparingly . <p> " Yes , " I croak at last . <p> He gestures with his head to the two chairs opposite his desk . " Sit down . " <p> I perch on the chair closest to the door . The office is immaculate as always , the desk bare except for a few tidy stacks of documents , the walls adorned only by the obligatory photographs of the President and Secretary of State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with direct lines to the Secretary and the National Security Advisor . Encrypted text , providing real-timeupdates on intelligence situations worldwide , scrolls down a computer screen . <p> I smooth my skirt . " Sir , I know we had an agreement ... " <p> " Have an agreement , " he corrects . " One year . " <p> " Yes . " A year had n't sounded that bad when the Director proposed it . Of course I was in the hospital at the time , two days out of Liberia , ten hours out of surgery , and so high on painkillers I scarcely remember his visit . Now , eight months later , a year seems like an eternity , indentured servitude . Not that working for the Director is exactly punishment ; as his liaison to the National Security Council , I 've spent my days shuttling between meetings at Foggy Bottom and the White House . I 've gained a view of foreign policy at the highest levels of government , and I 've seen things most people could not imagine in a lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And he 's going to say no . <p> The Director , one of the only people who can still get away with smoking in the building , reaches for the humidor that sits on the far right corner of his desk . I fight the urge to grimace as he clips the end of a cigar and lights it . <p> " Do n't get me wrong , " he says at last , puffing a cloud of smoke away from me . " I did n't really think I would be able to keep you here a full year . I 've had five calls about you in the last month alone . Karachi , Jakarta , Montenegro , Lagos , Bogota , all of the garden spots . " <p> I smile inwardly . " Garden spots " is a facetious term diplomats used to describe the real hardship posts . Those are the most interesting assignments and until now , I always sought them out , proud to say I had never been stationed in a place where one could actually drink the tap water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he pauses , " for London ... ? " He sets the cigar in an empty glass ashtray behind one of the stacks , then pulls a file with my name typed across the top from his desk drawer . My stomach twitches . I didn'tknow he kept a dossier on me . " You 've turned down London two , no , three times before . You do n't even like changing planes there . " He sets the file down , eyes me levelly . " So what gives ? " <p> I avert my gaze , staring over Van Antwerpen 's shoulder and out the window behind his desk . To the far left , I can just make out the Washington Monument in the distance , the pale stone obelisk muted against the gray sky . I swallow hard and shift in my seat . " It 's personal . " <p> I watch him hesitate , uncertain how to respond . Normally , such an explanation would be unacceptable . As intelligence officers , we are trained to separate our work and personal lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've earned my stripes , spent nearly the past ten years putting my life on the line . He 'll feel that he owes me this much . He has to feel that way ; I am counting on it . <p> " If you 'd prefer , I can take a leave of absence ... " I begin , but the Director waves his hand . <p> " No , they 'd kill me if I let you do that . You can have London . Martindale , " he pronounces the name as though it hurts his throat , " will be glad to have you . She tried to steal you away from me months ago . " <p> I smile , picturing Maureen Martindale , the vivacious , red-haired deputy chief of mission in London and Van Antwerpen 's longtime rival . I have n't seen Mo in three years , not since we worked together in San Salvador . My next move would have been to call her , if the Director refused my request . He closes the file . " We 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the paperwork in order . " <p> I take a deep breath . " I 'm sorry , sir , that wo n't work . I need to get over there immediately . Tonight , if possible . Tomorrow at the latest . " I know that I am pushing the envelope , risking his wrath by asking too much . " I 'll buy my own plane ticket and use vacation time until the paperwork comes through . If it 's a question of my projects here , I 'll finish up remotely , help find my replacement ... " The desperation in my voice grows . <p> Van Antwerpen is staring at me now , eyes skeptical . " What 's wrong , Weiss ? " <p> I hesitate . It is a question I no longer know how to answer . " Nothing , sir , " I lie at last . <p> " If you say so . " I can tell from his tone that he does not believe me , but I know he will not pry further . Paul Van Antwerpen is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , I 've never learned where he is from or whether he even has a family , and he affords his officers the same kind of privacy . His standoffish nature bothered me in the early years when I mistook it for disapproval . Now I just accept it as part of who he is , like the Coke-bottle glasses and the cigars . He stands up , extending his hand . " Good luck , Weiss . Whatever it is , I hope it works out . " <p> So do I. " Thank you , sir . " <p> Two hours later , I climb into the back of a battered navy blue taxi . " Arlington , please . Columbia Pike , " I request , pulling the door closed behind me . The taxi driver grunts and veers the car away from the curb onto the rain-soaked street . Garbled Indian music plays over the radio . I slump back against the torn vinyl seat , exhausted . The reality of what I 've done crashes down on me like a wave . <p> England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traffic light at Virginia Avenue turns from yellow to red , sending the small cardboard box of personal belongings I was balancing on my knees to the floor . I bend to pick up the contents . Not much to it : a " Solidarity " coffee mug given to me by Kasia , one of our Foreign Service nationals in Warsaw , as a going-away present ; a few reports that I need to finish up in London that I can not entrust to the diplomatic pouch ; a wood-framedpicture of my parents . I lift the photograph from the box , studying it . They are standing by the old maple tree in the backyard of our home in Vermont with identical burgundy wool sweaters tossed over their shoulders , looking like they stepped out of a J.Crew catalog . I run my finger over the glass . My mother 's hair , dark and curly like mine , is streaked with more gray than I remember . There wo n't be time to see them before I leave . I know , though , that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks and sometimes months without communication that my work necessitates . They will understand , or pretend to anyway , I think , gratitude mixing with guilt . They deserve grandchildren , or at least a daughter who calls before moving out of the country . <p> As the taxi climbs the Roosevelt Bridge toward Arlington , I sit back and reach into my coat pocket for my cell phone . For a moment I consider following protocol for once and going through the State Department travel office for my plane ticket . Then , deciding against it , I dial zero . " British Airways , " I request . The operator promptly transfers me to a prerecorded message of a woman 's voice with an English accent asking me to hold for the next available representative , followed by a Muzak version of Chopin 's Polonaise . <p> On hold , I lean sideways and press my forehead against the cool glass window , staring out at the white gravestones that line the wet , green hills of Arlington National Cemetery . I have been there twice for funerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both for diplomats whose patriotic valor earned them an exception to Arlington 's military-only burial policy . I think of Eric and once again see him fall backward out of the helicopter as it rises from the Liberian ground , feel the Marine 's arm clasped around my waist to stop me from jumping out after him . I swallow hard , my once-broken collarbone aching from dampness and memory . <p> " How may I help you ? " A British woman 's voice , live this time , jars me from my thoughts . I quickly convey my request . " London , tonight ? " the woman repeats , sounding surprised . " I 'll check if we have anything available . If not , can you travel tomorrow ? " <p> " No , it has to be tonight . " Panic rises . If I do not leave now , I might never go . <p> " One moment . " On the other end of the phone there is silence , then the sound of fingernails clicking against a keyboard . " There are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only have business class available . " <p> " Fine . " I am certain that Van Antwerpen will sign off on my reimbursement and that his signature carries enough weight to okay the upgrade , as well as the fact that I was n't going through the travel office or flying an American carrier . I recite my credit card number , which I know by heart , then memorize the confirmation number the operator gives me . " I 'll pick up the ticket at check-in , " I say before closing the phone . <p> Five minutes later , the taxi pulls up in front of my apartment building , a nondescript high-rise that caters to transient government workers . Inside , I ride the elevator to the sixth floor and turn the key in the lock of my studio apartment . Opening the venetian blinds , I look around the nearly empty room , noticing for the first time how stark the bare , white walls look . Then I sink down to the futon bed , the only piece of furniture in the room . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I lamented finding a place in Washington to live . " I do n't want to sign a lease . I do n't want to buy furniture , " I complained to my visiting mother . <p> " You can break the lease , you can sell the furniture , " she soothed , brushing my hair from my face as though I were five years old . " It 's not permanent . " Looking around the room now , I realize that she was right . The lease has a diplomatic transfer clause in it that will enable me to get out penalty-free . The rental store will pick up the bed the following day . In less than twenty-four hours , it will be as though I never lived here at all . Like everywhere else since England . <p> I reach into the large leather tote bag that serves as my briefcase and pull out the envelope that started everything . It was waiting for me at the reception desk of the apartment building this morning . At first I hesitated , surprised by the delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents ' house . Then , spotting Sarah 's familiar return address , I tore open the envelope . I had not seen her in more than two years , not since I had changed planes in Johannesburg and she had driven six hours from her hometown of Durban to meet me . In a small airport cafT that smelled of coffee and rotten meat , Sarah told me the news : her mystery illness , the one that made her right hand go limp eighteen months earlier , had finally been diagnosed . " It 's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , " she explained calmly . I stared at her blankly . " ALS . What you Americans refer to as Lou Gehrig 's disease . " <p> What Stephen Hawking has , I remembered . I had seen the famous professor in his wheelchair once or twice on the streets at Cambridge . Picturing his wizened body , the way he slumped helplessly in his wheelchair , my stomach clenched . Would Sarah become like that ? <p> " What will you do ? " I asked , pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to London , " Sarah replied . " The doctors are better there . " <p> " Come stay with me ? " I suggested . <p> But Sarah shook her head , laughing . " Jordie , your home is a post office box . " <p> She was right , I realized ; I did n't have an actual home to offer her . I took her hand . " What can I do ? " <p> " Nothing , " she answered firmly . " I 'll call you if I need you . " We hugged good-bye a few minutes later . Watching Sarah walk away , I was taken by her calm demeanor . She always had a hard time of it . Her mother died of Alzheimer 's disease and her father disappeared into the bush when Sarah was ten . <p> When I reached my hotel room that night , I logged in on my laptop and researched ALS . It was a death sentence , I learned , my eyes filling with tears . Gradual , complete paralysis . No known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted , her blue eyes so unafraid . I never should have left her . <p> After that day , Sarah and I stayed in touch by letter and the occasional phone call . In the past year , though , her letters had grown less frequent until they had stopped entirely six months earlier . I tried repeatedly to reach her by telephone , without success . Then this letter arrived . A single typed page , signature barely legible at the bottom , it was mostly routine , an apology for not having written sooner , some small talk about the weather in London . And then there was the last sentence : " I wish that I could see you again . If only you would come ... " I sat motionless , reading and rereading that one sentence . Sarah was there for my last days at Cambridge , knew how I felt about Englandand why . She never would have asked me to come unless she was desperate . It was , quite simply , the request of a dying woman . <p> I could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away from work . Though Sarah would not believe my excuse , she would understand . But it was Sarah who was there for me at college , ready to listen over tea , no matter how small the problem or late the hour , who had put me on the plane home from England at the end when I was so overcome with grief that I could barely walk , and who had traveled the globe three times to visit me since . She was that friend , loyalty unmuted by distance or the passage of years . Now she needed me , and not in that **31;66;TOOLONG way , but really needed me . Now it was my turn . <p> I refold the letter and place it back in my bag , then reach across the futon and pick up a flannel shirt . Mike 's shirt . I draw it to my nose and inhale deeply , seeing his brown hair and puppy dog eyes . We 've dated casually these past few months  --  drinks after work at one of the L Street bars between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , like last evening , a late visit when he returned from a trip . Physical comfort , warmth for the cold winter nights . Nothing serious , though I can tell from the way he looks at me that he hopes it will become so . I should call him , tell him that I am leaving . But I know that he will try to talk me out of going , and then , when he realizes he ca n't , he will insist on seeing me off at the airport . No , it 's better this way . I fold the shirt and set it down . I 'll mail it back with a note . <p> I stand up again and begin to pack my clothes and a few other belongings . Forty-five minutes later I am done . My whole life in two suitcases . There are other things , of course , dozens of boxes of books , pictures , and other mementos in government storage and my parents ' attic , things I have n't seen in so many years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again of the photograph of my parents . Sometimes I wish I could live a normal life like them , full of backyards and dishes and plants . I wish I could be content . <p> " If wishes were horses , " I say softly , " beggars would ride . " The expression of my mother 's , one I have n't thought of in years , rushes back to me . Everything seems to be coming back today . I pick up my bags and head for the door , closing it without looking behind me . Twenty minutes later , I climb into another damp and musty cab bound for Dulles Airport . As the car pulls away from the apartment building , and the Washington skyline recedes behind me , my spirits begin to lift . I am on the road again , the only place that truly feels like home . <p> Copyright 2009 by Pam Jenoff <br> Continues ...
