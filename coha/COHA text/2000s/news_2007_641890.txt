<p> Mark Lennihan AP / Not only could Dennis Rodman give WNBA players instruction on basketball , he could counsel them on wedding attire and maybe even share outfits with them . <p> ( See microfilm for photo description ) . ; <p> MJ LOCKER PERFECT FIT FOR KOBE WITH BULLS <p> A deal for Los Angeles Lakers star guard Kobe Bryant could involve Viktor Khryapa being moved . Not necessarily as in being part of any trade by the Bulls , but as in opening a cubicle in the United Center locker room . Not just any locker , of course . The same one that Michael Jordan used to call his . Even a team source envisions Bryant taking over that coveted spot next to the door to the team 's inner sanctum that is off-limits to the media ( and where a guy can dress and undress in peace ) . If Kobe is going to consider buying MJ 's Highland Park dwelling , he might as well also occupy his workplace real estate . <p> +It would be interesting to see whether a Bryant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in the Second Coming of MJ and lift the team to a championship caliber , but also if Bryant could raise the bar in terms of Jordan-like sartorial splendor . That was one area MJ most definitely was well-suited . <p> +Japanese outfielder Kosuke Fukudome reportedly has the Cubs interested . If nothing else , he theoretically would provide a challenge for White Sox fans to come up with nicknames for their interleague meetings . OK , not that much of a challenge . <p> +Big-league general managers endorsing replay for home-run calls . Oh , the sanctity of the sport ! It 's only a matter of time before replay expands to other calls . And you know you 'll have then ? Umpires actually getting calls right . <p> Look for umpires to oppose replays and owners to favor them  --  once the bean counters realize they can sell more beer , hot dogs , etc. ( not to mention radio and TV commercials ) during breaks in the action . <p> +Maybe Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds can start their own baseball league . One that presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> COACH IS FIRST CLASS <p> RODMAN HAS EYES ON WNBA <p> A return to professional basketball for Dennis Rodman . <p> The former Bulls forward hopes to move forward  --  in the WNBA . <p> Although he may have the wardrobe to qualify for the women 's league , he would seem ineligible to play  --  unless he has had a radical transformation . <p> What he hopes to achieve is radical enough : coach . <p> And as long as he wants to go into coaching , he might as well start at the top . Or as close to the top as the WNBA is . He wants to be the head coach . Whether that head will sport multicolored hair  --  as it frequently did in his playing days  --  is uncertain . <p> " Any of my teammates can tell you that my knowledge of the game is second to none , " Rodman said in a press release . " My team would learn the skills that made me the player that will send me to the Hall of Fame . Our players would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league in rebounding , have a defensive-minded identity , and we 'd run the triangle offense . " <p> Seriously . Or as seriously as Rodman  --  who recently finished his second season of makeover show " Geek to Freek " on HDNet  --  can be . <p> " Dennis has been talking about doing this for a while , but there was never a convenient time , " Rodman 's agent , Darren Prince , said . " He is ready to put everything on hold in pursuit of this ambition . " <p> CELEBRITY MARATHONING <p> LANCE CRUISES , HOLMES FINISHES <p> Katie Holmes and Lance Armstrong had the times of their lives Sunday . <p> Competing in the New York City Marathon , seven-time Tour de France champion Armstrong finished in 2:46:43 . Actress/mother of Suri/wife of Tom Cruise finished . So what if her time was 5:29.58 . <p> " I 'm good , but I 'm feeling very tired , " she told people.com in the aftermath of the race . <p> Asked which part of the race was the most difficult , Holmes answered : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said his wife is " inspired . She trained for three months . " <p> As for their daughter , whom he had to chase around a banquet tent set up in Central Park , the actor said , " She 's a runner ! " <p> Armstrong is one , too , as evidenced by improving his time from 2006 by 13 minutes . <p> " I enjoyed it more this year , " said Armstrong , who finished 214th among the men . " Last year , I had no idea what to expect with 26.2 miles , and I paid for it . " <p> Armstrong lost seven pounds and weighed 173 pounds in racing this year . <p> " Just like in cycling , your body weight is a huge factor , " he said . " It 's no accident that the best in the world weigh 120 pounds . " <p> Armstrong has cut his time down about as far as he envisions . <p> " My lifestyle does n't lead to that faster times , more training right now because I travel all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I still like to go out and have fun and eat what I want and have a beer every now and again . I do n't want to cut that out in order to run faster . I 've done a lot of things in my life fast , so it 's now time to do them just for fun and recreation . " <p> ROUND MOUND OF RIGHT ON THE MONEY <p> BARKLEY : KOBE OR NOT , BULLS STILL NEED SCORER <p> Thanksgiving or bust ? <p> Is that the deal for a Bulls-Lakers deal involving Kobe Bryant ? <p> That was the question posed to former NBA star Charles Barkley on the " Waddle &; Silvy " show Tuesday on ESPN Radio ( 1000-AM ) . <p> " I do n't know that , " Barkley said . " I think what I have said is if they 're gon na lose him ... for nothing , then they 've got to make a trade . I mean , that 's just strictly business sense . I mean , he 's the best player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for nothing . I do n't care either way , personally . I 'm sick of talking about Kobe and the Lakers . They 're not a very good team . But all I 've said is if they 're gon na lose him for nothing , they 've got to make the trade . " <p> Third man in the ring among the questioners , Mark Giangreco said , " So the Bulls have to give up Luol Deng and the Lakers have to ask for less , one of the two , right ? " <p> " Well , it depends , " Barkley said . " Luol is a good , young player . I do n't know what else the Lakers would want . I mean , if I was the Lakers , I would want him , but you ca n't do a one-on-one deal , obviously . But it depends on what the Bulls are willing to give up . Because Kobe 's the best player in the game . And the Bulls are not gon na win it the way they are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 seed again , probably . The Bulls need some consistent scoring , and right now their two best scorers are jump shooters . You 're not gon na win shooting jumpers ; you 're gon na lose shooting jumpers . <p> " And their two best scorers are Ben Gordon and Kirk Hinrich , but they 're strictly , strictly jump shooters , and you 're not going to win in the long run shooting jump shots . " <p> STILL KICKIN ' <p> BECKHAM SCORES BIG IN CHARITY EVENT <p> Now that the soccer season is winding down , David Beckham seems more up to playing . <p> The Los Angeles Galaxy star , who was sidelined for much of the Major League Soccer season by injuries , played 83 minutes Sunday in a soccer exhibition to raise money for victims of the Southern California wildfires last month . <p> " It 's probably the best I 've felt in quite a few months now , " said Beckham , who had two goals and three assists in a 12-4 victory against actor Anthony LaPaglia 's Hollywood United team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good workout tonight . I 've been working hard trying to get myself fit . " <p> Beckham hopes to be able to play in a Galaxy postseason schedule featuring four exhibitions in five weeks and to be available for England 's national team . <p> " I want to be involved in every game possible , but I 've got to get my fitness right , " he said . " I ca n't put myself up for selection if I 'm not 100 percent fit , or at least 90 to 95 percent fit . " <p> The highlight of the contest for goalie LaPaglia , who allowed Beckham 's goals , was stopping him on a free kick . <p> " That one goes on the screen saver , " LaPaglia said . " I never thought I would get the opportunity to face him in an <p> actual game . " <p> OUTTAKES
