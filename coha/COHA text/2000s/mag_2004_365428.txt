Price wars are nearly unheard of in the mutual-fund industry , but last week Fidelity Investments , run by Edward C. ( Ned ) Johnson III , right , cut expenses on five of its index mutual funds . The move , which follows other fee cuts , like the elimination of many funds ' sales charges , was a direct swipe at index-fund leader Vanguard Group and a nod to the increasing popularity of exchange-traded funds  --  low-cost baskets of stock that track particular indexes and trade on stock exchanges . Expenses on the five funds , which are pegged to such benchmarks as the S &P; 500 or the Wilshire 5000 , are now just 0.10% of assets annually . Fidelity sells the funds directly and through many retirement plans .
