1 . the old race track <p> TROY COULD HARDLY WAIT until supper was over . He wanted to tell Toute what he had discovered ; he wanted to tell Bug ; he wanted to tell somebody . Telling made things real , but you had to have the right person to tell . This was not the sort of thing you told your parents . <p> He fidgeted at the dinner table , ignoring his father 's gloomy silence and his mother 's chatter . She was trying to cheer him up and failing , as always . <p> Troy cleaned his plate , which was the rule . First the meat , then the beans , then the salad . Finally ! " Excuse me , may I be excused ? " <p> " You do n't have to run ! " his father said . <p> I know I do n't have to run , Troy thought as he hit six on the speed dial . Toute 's line was busy . He was n't surprised . It had been busy a lot lately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Pass , may I speak with Bug , please ? " <p> " Clarence , it 's for you ! " <p> " Bug , it 's me , listen . Guess what I found out . You know that white fence at the old race track ? That broken down fence by the arcade ? " <p> " The one with all the signs . " <p> " That one . I just discovered something today . Something really weird . Something really strange . Something really amazing . " <p> " Discovered what ? " <p> " Well - " Suddenly Troy was reluctant to talk about it on the telephone . It seemed , somehow , dangerous . What if the grownups were to hear , and what if for some reason they were n't supposed to hear ? It was always a possibility . Every kid knew that the world was filled with things that grownups did n't know , were n't supposed to know . Things that were out of the ordinary worried them . Worrying turned them into shouters . Or whisperers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I ca n't talk about it now , " Troy said , lowering his voice , even though his parents in the next room obviously were n't listening ; they were having one of their whisper-arguments . " I 'll tell you tomorrow . Meet me at the usual tree tomorrow , the usual time . " <p> " I have practice . " <p> " Not till afternoon . We 'll have time to do some fishing . " <p> The usual tree was at the corner of Oak and Elm ; the usual time was as soon after breakfast as possible , allowing for the handful of chores required by Life with Parents : in Troy 's case , garbage take-out and sweeping ( for some reason ) the crab apples and leaves from the driveway . The old race track was at the edge of town , where the houses gave way to fields . There was no new race track , only the old one , long abandoned . It was just a dirt oval around a shallow lake that was all grown over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it Scum Lake . That is , Troy called it Scum Lake and Bug went along . Bug generally went along . <p> The race track could have been for horses , but there were no stables . It could have been for cars , but there were no pits . No one seemed to remember who had built it or what it was for . <p> As they rode their bikes toward the track , Troy tried again to tell Bug what he had discovered . " You know the white fence along the infield , the one with all the signs on it ? Well , yesterday , after you left for baseball , I climbed up into the stands , and when I looked down .... " <p> " The stands ! You climbed up there ? They 're so rickety , the whole thing could fall down ! " <p> " Well , it did n't , and it wo n't if you watch your step . Anyway , here we are . I 'll show you . " <p> They parked their bikes by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody came by the old race track , and nobody stole in their town anyway . Sometimes Troy wished they did . <p> " Come on , and you 'll see ! " Troy led the way through the hole something ( not they ) had dug under the fence , and then through the dark tunnel under the stands , lined with dead soda machines . Bug carried his backpack with his ball glove in it , and Pop-Tarts for lunch . Usually they just headed across the track for the infield and the lake ; but today , after they emerged into the bright sunlight , Troy led the way up into the stands , using the board seats for steps . <p> Troy knew Bug did n't like high places , but he knew he would follow . The planks wobbled and rattled and boomed with every step . <p> " The cheap seats , " Troy said , sitting down on the top plank . Bug sat beside him , with his backpack between his feet . From here , they could see the entire track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backstretch , fields of beans in long straight rows ; and beyond them , the dunes . <p> " I stayed yesterday , after you left for baseball , " Troy said . " I like to come up here sometimes and read , or just look around . You know , imagine what it was like when there were cars on the track , or horses , you know ? " <p> " I guess , " said Bug , who was a little short on imagining things . <p> " Anyway , look at the fence from here . " A white fence followed the track halfway around the infield side . It was broken into two parts , which met at an old enclosed plywood food arcade near the starting/finish line . The fence opposite the grandstands was almost straight , but the part that led toward the lake wandered crazily , left and then right . Parts of it were fallen , and other parts were still upright . <p> " What 's that fence for ? It does n't keep anything out or in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't they look like two wings of a bird , but broken ? " <p> " I guess , " said Bug . " But .... " <p> " Plus , have you ever noticed how they are n't really very strong . They 're made out of slats and wire and canvas , that white stuff . " <p> " That 's because they 're just for signs . " Bug read them aloud , like the answers on a test : " Krazy Kandy , Drives You Wild . Buddy Cola - Get Together ! Lectio with Powerful Electrolytes . Mystery Bread . " <p> " Maybe . But maybe not , " Troy said . " Maybe they are wings . " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " You can only see it from up here . See ? They look like the wings of an airplane - an old fashioned airplane , an aeroplane , all wood and wire and canvas . The wings meet at the arcade , which would be the fuselage . " Troy was proud of his knowledge of airplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The front end of the arcade , there , by the track , would be the cockpit . " <p> Bug was skeptical . " So where 's the tail ? An airplane has to have a tail . " <p> " The outhouse , " said Troy , pointing to an old wooden outhouse at the far end of the arcade that had turned over and split into two parts . " It makes a V-tail , which some planes have . Everything looks like something else , do n't you see ? If it was a crashed airplane , that crashed here a long time ago , and it was too big to move or get rid of , they would 've just built a race track around it so that nobody would know what it was , because that would give away the secret . " <p> " What secret ? " Bug asked . <p> " The secret that it is an airplane , " said Troy . <p> " I guess , " said Bug , picking up his backpack and starting down . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Bug , it was always time to go fishing . Fishing in Scum Lake was sort of like ice fishing , which neither of them had ever done , but Troy had read about in a magazine . You made a hole in the ice ( or scum ) that covered the lake , then dropped in your line and waited . But not for long . The little bluegill were so eager to get caught that they fought over the hook ; they would take worms or cheese , but worms were better . <p> Troy and Bug climbed down from the stands , rattling the planks , and walked across the track to the infield . They slipped through a fallen section of fence , or wing , and followed the short path through the reeds to the lake . Their fishing poles were under the dock , where they had hidden them . Digging under an old tire , they found worms . <p> They sat on the end of the dock and caught bluegills , then threw them back . They were too little to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pop-Tarts . Troy caught eleven and Bug caught twenty-six . Bug usually caught more . Troy was careful taking out the hooks . He wondered if it actually hurt the fish . <p> He was beginning to suspect that it did . <p> The bluegill were n't the only fish in Scum Lake . There was also a catfish as big as a rowboat . Troy had seen it once , from the end of the dock , when the light and shadow were just right . Bug had seen it , once , sort of ; at least he said he had . <p> After he had caught his first " rerun , " Troy quit fishing . He left the line in the water , just to make Bug happy , but left off the worm . It was fun just to sit in the Sun and talk about things . Troy did most of the talking , as usual ; Bug was content to just listen . " Did n't you ever wonder how everybody got to our town ? " Troy asked . <p> " In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they multiplied . Did n't you ever wonder why they are all so much alike ? " <p> " I guess . But I have to go to practice . " <p> They hid their poles and started back toward the stands . On the way , Troy walked off the two ends of the infield fence . The two sections had different signs - Buddy Cola , Krazy Kandy , Oldsmobile - but were exactly the same length . Did n't that prove that they were , in fact , wings ? And the arcade where they met definitely could have been the fuselage . It was about twenty feet long , with a flat roof ; one side was open above waist-high counters . <p> " I 'm going in , " Troy said , climbing over a counter on the open side . Bug grumbled but passed in his backpack and followed . The roof and the floor were plywood . The roof was low enough to reach up and touch . They had to duck under a three-bladed ceiling fan . Troy reached up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here , " said Bug , wrinkling his nose . <p> " Mouse droppings , " said Troy . <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " Mouse crap . Mouse shit , " said Troy . " Let 's look up front . " <p> " All right but it 's getting late . " <p> The plywood floor creaked as they walked , bent over , toward the front of the arcade , where a dirty glass window overlooked the track . Under the window , there was an old-fashioned radio , filled with dusty vacuum tubes of all different sizes . It sat on a low shelf next to an ashtray filled with white sand . <p> " Here we have the cockpit , " said Troy . " The control center . Why else would there be a radio ? " <p> " Announcers , " said Bug . " Anyway , I have to go to practice . " <p> " Okay , okay , " said Troy . He climbed out and helped Bug with his backpack . He stopped at the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground now it looked like an airplane . He did n't need to be up in the stands to see it . It just took a little imagination . <p> " What about a propeller ? " said Bug . " An old airplane , made out of wood and canvas , would have a propeller . " <p> True , thought Troy , as they descended into the tunnel . But not true in a way that opened up possibilities . True in a way that closed them down ; not the kind of true he liked . <p> They rode together to the usual tree , before riding off in different directions . Bug lived in the old section of town , with all the trees . Troy lived in one of the new , big houses on the way to the mall . <p> " See you tomorrow , " said Bug . <p> " I may not make it tomorrow , " said Troy . " I have to go to the mall with my cousin . " <p> " Thebent girl ? She 's so bossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troy . <p> 2. the bent girl <p> TOUTE WAS TROY 'S COUSIN but more like his sister , especially since he did n't have a sister . When they were kids he and Toute had slept together and even bathed together , until they got old enough for the grownups to realize that , hey , one 's a boy and one 's a girl . <p> Toute was eleven , almost a year older than Troy . She got her name because when she was little , her mother had taken her to Quebec for treatments , and she had learned to say " Toute " for everything . <p> Toute means everything in French , which was funny , Troy thought , because Toute got hardly anything . First her mother died . Then she got more and more bent until she could hardly walk , and could n't ride a bicycle at all . Once a week she went to a special doctor in the mall , and Troy went with her so they could pretend it was a trip for fun . But it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments , and sometimes she looked like she had been crying . <p> The next morning Troy rode his bike to Toute 's house , which was not far from the usual tree . There was an extra car in the driveway . The door was open . Toute 's father and two strange men were in the living room , talking in whispers . <p> Toute was sitting on the stairs . She looked gloomy but she smiled when she saw Troy . " I had a dream about you last night , " she said . " I dreamed you had your own airplane and you took me for a ride . " <p> " No way ! " said Troy . He sat down beside her and told her what he had discovered at the race track . Now he was more convinced than ever that it was real . <p> " Get my backpack , " Toute said . " It 's up in my room . Let 's go . " <p> " Do n't you have to go to the mall for that treatment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said emphatically , as if discontinue were something you actually did instead of stopped doing . " So I 'm free all day . Get a bottle of Lectro out of the fridge . We can leave a note for my dad . " <p> Toute sat on the crossbar of Troy 's bike . She could sit okay , though she could n't stand without holding onto something . They rode by the usual tree , just in case - and there was Bug . <p> " Where did she come from ? " he asked Troy . " I thought you said you and her had to go to the mall . " <p> " I want to see the airplane , " said Toute . <p> " She wants to go fishing with us , " Troy said . <p> " She does n't have a fishing pole , " Bug pointed out . <p> " She can use mine , " said Troy . <p> They parked their bikes against the chainlink fence and crawled under . Toute was pretty good at that part ; then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked though the tunnel , past the dark abandoned drink machines . <p> Troy was wondering how he was going to get Toute up into the stands . It turned out not to be a problem . As soon as they emerged from the tunnel into the light , Toute blinked twice and said : <p> " Definitely an aeroplane . " <p> " Huh ? " said Bug . <p> " Aer-o-plane , " she said , pronouncing each syllable . " More old fashioned than an airplane . All wood and canvas . Let 's look inside . " <p> " It 's just some old plywood , " said Bug , but Troy and Toute were already heading across the track . <p> The boys helped Toute over the counter on the open side , and climbed in after her . <p> " Smells in here , " said Toute , wrinkling her nose . <p> " Mouse droppings , " said Bug . <p> " Here 's the cockpit , " said Troy . He tried to wipe the window clean but most of the dirt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main power control , " said Toute . <p> " That 's the radio , " Troy said . <p> " It 's a receiver , " said Toute . " It can draw power out of the air . There 's a lot of radio waves flopping around out there that never get used . Turn it on . " <p> Troy turned the biggest dial , in the center , to the right , then to the left . " Nothing . " <p> " And here 's why . This battery is bone dry , " said Toute , stirring the white sand in the ashtray . " Hand me my Lectro , Bug . It 's in my backpack . " <p> She was too bent to reach into her own backpack . Bug grumbled but did it for her , handing her the plastic bottle . She poured a narrow stream of clear liquid into the white sand ashtray , making a damp spiral in the sand . <p> " What does that do ? " asked Troy . <p> " Lectro has powerful electrolytes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bug . " You can put this back now . " <p> " Thanks , " Bug said sarcastically as he put it back . " Is n't it time to go fishing ? " <p> Bug caught twenty-one bluegills , and Troy caught sixteen . Even Toute , a girl , caught eleven , on a handline . <p> Troy quit when he caught his first rerun , but Toute kept going . " I do n't know why everybody feels sorry for the fish , " she said . " I feel sorry for the worms . " <p> " You get over feeling sorry for the worms , " said Bug . <p> Toute was so bent that she had to sit sideways on the dock . " What I really want is to see this giant catfish you are always talking about . " <p> " It 's best on a cloudy day , " said Troy . " Then the light does n't reflect off the surface of the water , and you can see all the way to the bottom . " <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three crawled to the edge of the dock ; Troy made a hole in the scum with his hands . They could see all the way to the bottom , the little waving weeds and a few small fish , examining an old tire . But there was no giant catfish . <p> " It may be an urban myth , " Toute said . <p> " What 's that ? " asked Bug . <p> " You 're forgetting one thing , " said Troy . " I saw it myself . " <p> " Bug , did you see it ? " <p> " I think I did , " Bug said . <p> " I want to see it myself , " said Toute . " Troy makes things up sometimes . " <p> Troy felt betrayed . It was Toute who had showed him the Teeny-Weenies who lived in the roots of a tree in her yard . He tried to remember if he had really seen them or just wanted to see them . He could n't remember . <p> Bug had two Pop-Tarts in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take their lines out of the water to eat , because the fish were so eager to get caught . <p> They were just finishing the Pop-Tarts and putting their poles back into the water when Troy heard something strange . " What was that ? " <p> " What ? " said Bug . <p> " Sounds like groaning , " Toute said . <p> " The wind , " said Bug . <p> " I do n't think so , " said Toute . " Better go see . " <p> Troy left his pole in the water and went to investigate . The infield section of fence was tipped over until it was almost flat on the ground . The other side , along the track , had fallen , too . Lying down , the fence looked more like a wing than ever . <p> " The wind probably blew it over , " said Bug , when Troy returned . <p> " There is n't any wind , " Troy said . <p> " There may be at the other end , " Bug suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " <p> " There it is again , " said Troy . <p> They all three heard it this time : a groan , a rattle , a splintering sound like a branch breaking . <p> " Sounds like the mating call of a tyrannosaur , " said Toute . <p> They put away the poles and went to investigate , all three this time . Toute walked between the two boys , an arm around each shoulder . Her feet barely touched the ground . <p> Both fences were now completely flat . The front of the arcade was now sticking out onto the track ; it had dragged the ends of the fences with it . <p> " The wings are swept back , like a jet , " said Troy . <p> The outhouse on the back had tipped so that now it looked more like a V-shaped tail than ever . They could enter the arcade through it without climbing over the counter . <p> " Ugh , it stinks , " said Toute . " It 's like the butt . " <p> The tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them , palm down . " It 's warming up , " she said . " Bug , the Lectro . In my back-pack . " <p> " You do n't have to be so bossy , " he said , even as he was opening it . <p> " Sorry , " she said ( though she did n't sound sorry ) . " You 'd be bossy too if you were so bent you could n't reach into your own backpack . " <p> " No , I would n't , " said Bug . He handed her the Lectro , and she poured half the bottle into the sand . <p> " What happened to the fan ? " asked Troy , looking up . The ceiling fan was gone . <p> " I have practice , " said Bug . <p> Toute gave Bug the Lectro to put back in her pack . They helped her out over the counter on the open side , because she did n't like the smell in the " butt . " None of them did . <p> They walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fan ! " said Bug . " Now it does look like an airplane . " <p> " Aeroplane , " said Troy . The ceiling fan was on the front of the fuselage , just under the front window . It was turning slowly , even though there was no breeze . <p> Troy stopped it with his hand . When he let go , it started up again . <p> " This is getting weird , " he said . <p> " We 're going to get blamed for this , " said Bug . " Let 's get out of here . " <p> " Blamed for what ? Blamed by who ? " asked Toute . <p> " For making things different . " <p> " Do n't be silly , " she said . But even she seemed uncomfortable . She got between the two boys and they started through the tunnel . <p> Troy stopped for one last look . Was it his imagination , or had the aeroplane turned , just a little , so that it was starting to point down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant , " Toute said . " Can we come back tomorrow and see what it 's grown into ? " <p> " I guess , " said Troy . <p> " I have practice every day this week , " said Bug . <p> " What did you kids do today ? " Troy 's father asked that night at the table . <p> " Nothing much , " said Troy . " I took Toute for a ride on my bike . " <p> " That 's nice , " said Troy 's mother . " You should take her again tomorrow . Her father has discontinued her treatments , and she .... " <p> " Claire ! " said Troy 's father sharply . Then they started one of their whisper arguments . <p> " Can I be excused ? " asked Troy . He wanted to go to his room and think about the aeroplane . He was wondering if it would still be there the next day ; wondering if it would fly . <p> 3. into the air <p> The next morning Toute was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Do n't go in , " she said . " It 's chaos in there . " Chaos was one of her favorite words . <p> She perched on Troy 's crossbar and they rode to the usual tree and picked up Bug . " I brought three Pop-Tarts today , " he said . <p> They left the bikes in the weeds and crawled under the fence and hurried through the tunnel . <p> They emerged into the light - and there it was . Bug was the first to speak . <p> " It moved . " <p> The aeroplane - for there was no longer any doubt what it was - was halfway on the track . The front of the arcade , the fuselage , was angled across the start-finish line , pointing up the track . The outhouse was split into a V-tail . The right wing was still in the infield , but the end of the left one drooped onto the hard clay of the track . <p> The ceiling fan on the front , under the windshield , was turning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the fuselage , though the back still dragged in the dirt . <p> " It even has wheels , " said Troy . He noticed that two wheels were missing off a tipped-over hot dog cart nearby . <p> " Of course , " said Toute . " It wants to be what we want it to be . An aeroplane . " <p> " Maybe it 's some kind of car , " said Bug . <p> " With wings ? Give me a boost , " said Toute . They lifted her through the side window into the plane , and then followed after her . The plywood creaked under their feet . <p> The tubes in the radio were barely glowing . Toute stirred the white sand with her fingertips . " Needs more Lectro . " <p> " Turn around , I 'll get it out of your pack , " said Troy . <p> " I forgot to bring it , " said Toute . <p> " I thought you always carried Lectro , " Bug said . <p> " I forgot it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have practice does n't mean I do n't have a lot of things to worry about . " <p> " There 's a Lectro machine in the tunnel , " said Troy . " But it 's dead . " " Not exactly , " said Bug . <p> " What do you mean ? " Toute asked . <p> " If I get you your Lectro , can we go fishing ? " <p> " Deal , " said Toute . <p> Toute and Troy watched from inside the aeroplane while Bug climbed out and crossed the track , and descended into the tunnel . " Are n't you curious ? " Toute asked . <p> " I guess . " Troy climbed out and followed , at a distance , like a spy . <p> At the bottom of the tunnel , where it was darkest , the drink machines sat against one wall . There were three of them . Troy had always thought they looked like lurking monsters . <p> Bug walked up to the center machine and , after looking both ways , kicked it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , illuminating the logo on the front of the machine . Lectio ! With Powerful Electrolytes ! <p> Bug looked both ways again , then hit the machine once with the heel of his right hand , right under the big L. <p> A coin dropped into the coin return slot with a loud clink . <p> Cool , thought Troy . Bug had hidden talents . <p> Bug dropped the coin into the slot at the top of the machine and hit a square button . <p> A plastic bottle rumbled into the bin at the bottom . <p> Troy stepped out of the shadows , clapping . <p> Bug jumped - then grinned when he saw who it was . " I did n't know you were there . " <p> " You have hidden talents ! " <p> " Just because you never notice them does n't mean they 're hidden , " Bug said , starting up the tunnel , toward the daylight . <p> " It 's warm , " said Bug , as he handed the bottle through the big side window into the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She poured half the bottle into the sand . " It 's not for drinking . Look . " <p> Troy could see the radio under the front windshield . The tubes were starting to glow , just a little . <p> He reached for the fan . It started to turn on its own , before he could touch it . He pulled his hand back . Weird ! <p> " I thought we were supposed to go fishing , " Bug said . <p> " Deal , " said Toute . " Just give me a hand out of here . " <p> Bug caught twelve and Troy caught nine and even Toute , the girl , caught six . Then they ate their Pop-Tarts . Bug had brought one for each of them this time . <p> " What 's that noise ? " said Bug . <p> They all heard it : a low groaning sound , from the race track . <p> " I 'll go see , " said Troy . <p> " I 'm going too , " said Toute , grabbing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track . The wings were straight , no longer swept back ; they drooped at the ends , so that the tips touched the clay . The fan , in the front of the fuselage , was turning so fast that Troy could n't make out the individual blades . <p> " This is too weird , " he said . <p> " Or just weird enough , " said Toute . " Give me a boost . " He helped her inside and followed after her . The tubes in the radio were glowing . Troy put his hand over them ; they were warm , like a fire . <p> " What are you doing ? " he asked Toute . <p> " What do you think ? " She was pouring more Lectro into the sand . The fan was turning faster . A weird creaking came from under the floor . Troy knew what it was without looking - the wire wheels turning . <p> The plane was moving slowly down the straightaway toward the first turn . The fan turned faster and faster , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane . Troy could still see the blades , like a shadow , under the front window - or rather , windshield . <p> " That 's enough ! " he said . Toute put the cap back on the Lectro bottle . There was only about an inch left . <p> " Wait ! " It was Bug . He was running alongside , trying to carry his backpack in one hand and grab the wing with the other . " Slow down ! " <p> " No brakes ! " Troy had n't realized the plane was going so fast . And it was going faster all the time . The wingtips were off the ground . " Throw me your backpack , " he said . <p> Bug threw his backpack in through the big side window , then scrambled in behind it . " Careful ! " said Toute . " Do n't kick a hole in the wing ! " <p> " Ooooomph ! " said Bug , landing with a loud thump on the plywood floor . " How do we stop this thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Toute was in the front , by the radio , staring straight ahead , down the track . " Troy , come up here ! You have to steer . " <p> " Me ? " Troy tried to walk . The plane was lurching from side to side . The wheels were squealing and the plywood was creaking and rattling . <p> " It 's your plane , " Toute said . " You discovered it . " <p> " I just found it , that 's all , " said Troy , joining her at the windshield . " Uh oh ! " <p> The plane was almost at the first turn . It was going to run off the track and into the grass . Maybe , Troy thought , that would be best . It would bounce to a stop and <p> " Try the knobs , " said Toute . <p> There were three knobs on the radio . The one in the center was the biggest . Troy turned it to the right , and the plane turned to the right , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plane lumbered on around the first turn , the left wing tip just brushing the weeds at the edge of the track . Troy turned the knob back so the notch was at the top . The plane started down the back straightaway , going faster and faster . <p> " Fasten your seat belts ! " said Toute . <p> " I do n't like this , " said Bug . <p> Troy could n't decide if he liked it or not . The trees and weeds seemed to speed past , as the plane bounced and rattled down the track . It seemed to Troy that it was the world that was sliding backward while the plane was standing still . Well , almost still ; it was bouncing up and down and weaving from side to side . <p> The little fan was spinning soundlessly under the windshield . Troy had read enough about airplanes to know that it was not nearly big enough to make the plane move . But the plane was moving . <p> It was not nearly big enough to make the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bug . <p> " We 're flying , " said Toute . " We 're in the air . " <p> It was true . The wheels were no longer squealing and the plywood floor was no longer bouncing up and down . Troy looked down . The track was dropping away , like a rug being pulled out from under them . They were approaching the finish line , where they had started , but this time they were almost as high as the stands - and getting higher . <p> " Okay , now make it go down , " said Bug , looking out the side window . <p> " Hold on ! " said Toute . " Everybody hold on . " <p> Bug made his way to the front and squeezed in between Troy and Toute . " Okay , now make it go down , " he said again . " Seriously . " <p> Troy turned the center knob to the right , and the plane banked , following the curve of the track . He started to straighten it for the back straightaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leave it , " she said . " Circling is good . " <p> The circles got wider and wider as the plane got higher and higher . <p> Below they could see the whole track , with Scum Lake in the center , bright green . There was the chain link fence , with their bikes in the weeds beside it . <p> There were the streets , the houses , the trees : all in miniature , seen from above . <p> Troy checked the wings , to the right and to the left . They were straight , then bent upward slightly at the tip . The canvas was stretched tight , except for a few wrinkles that flapped in the wind . <p> " We 're going to get in trouble , " said Bug . <p> Troy and Toute said nothing . What was there to say ? They stood on either side of Bug , looking out of the front of the plane as it circled wider , leaving the track behind . There was the usual oak , and Toute 's house , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said scornfully . " Big meeting today . " <p> There was the school , shut down for the summer . The baseball diamond in the back was empty . " At least you 're not late for practice , " said Troy . <p> " Not yet , " said Bug . " Ca n't you make it go back to the track ? " <p> " It seems to know where it wants to go , " said Troy . " Like a horse or a dog . " <p> " I never had a horse , " Toute said wistfully . " Or a dog . " Then she clapped her hands . " But this is better ! " <p> The circles got wider and wider and higher and higher . They flew over the center of town . The clock on the courthouse tower said 12:17 . A few cars scooted through the streets , under the trees . It was so quiet below that they could hear a screen door slam . They heard a dog bark . <p> A few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People in our town never look up , Troy thought . And it was a good thing , too . What would they see ? A plywood plane with long , square-tipped , white canvas wings , soaring higher and higher . <p> At the edge of town , Troy could see the bean fields and a couple of rundown farmhouses ; and then the green fields gave way to yellow dunes , some of them as high as a house . <p> It was just as Troy had always suspected . The town was surrounded by a wilderness of sand . There was n't a road or even a path leading in or out , as far as he could see . <p> Troy turned the knob back to the left , so that the notch pointed straight up . <p> The right wing creaked and came up , the left wing dropped , just a little , and the plane flew straight toward the edge of town . <p> " Whoa , " said Bug , looking alarmed . " What are you doing ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you want to see what 's out there ? " <p> " No way . " <p> " Out where ? " Toute asked . <p> " Past the town . Past the fields . On the other side of the dunes . " <p> 4. across a sea of sand <p> The PLANE FLEW straight , soundlessly . <p> It flew straight past the courthouse , between the water tower and the church steeple . <p> The trees gave way to fields , edged with fences . The last street became a dirt road . Someone was riding a bicycle ; someone who did n't look up . The road ended in a field of grass , and the grass gave way to sand . <p> " I do n't think we 're supposed to fly out here , " said Bug . <p> " We 're not supposed to fly , period , " Toute pointed out . <p> The dunes lapped like waves at the edge of the grass . At first there were patches of grass in the hollows between them ; then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , yellow sand . <p> " Nothing but sand , " said Toute . She looked almost scared . <p> " Just as I always suspected , " said Troy . " Though nobody talks about it , ever . " The dunes went on and on as far as he could see . He leaned out the side window and looked back . The town was an island of trees in a sea of sand . It looked too impossibly tiny to be the town where they had all lived , until this very moment <p> And it was getting smaller and smaller . <p> " Time to turn around , " said Bug . <p> " Not yet , " said Troy . " Do n't you want to know what 's out here ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Nothing but sand , " said Toute . " A sea of sand . " <p> The plane flew on . Troy stood at the front , at the controls , with his hand on the knob . There was nothing but yellow desert in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked back . The town was just a dark smudge against the horizon . Maybe it was time to turn back . <p> He turned the knob to the right . <p> Nothing happened . He turned it back to the left , but the plane flew on , straight . He wiggled the knob from side to side . <p> Nothing . <p> " What 's the matter ? " Toute asked . <p> " Nothing . " <p> Troy turned the knob each way again , then straightened it with the notch at the top . No need to tell the others ; not yet , anyway . It would just worry them . <p> He stood at the front with his hand on the knob . The sand looked the same in every direction . There were a few smudges of grass , an occasional dark spot where a dead tree poked up through the drifts . But no roads , no houses , no fences . <p> The plane flew on , tirelessly , soundlessly . Troy stuck his face out the left side , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they were going a little faster than a bicycle ; a little faster than a boy could run . <p> " We do n't have any food or water , " said Bug . <p> " I have food , " said Toute . " Look in my backpack . " <p> Bug pulled out a Pop-Tart . He handed it to Toute , and she sat down beside him and broke it into three pieces . <p> Troy put his piece on the shelf beside the radio . he was too nervous to eat . He was afraid that if he let go of the knob , the plane would spin to the ground , or fall , or lose its way . He took his hand off the knob , as an experiment ; nothing happened . But he felt better at the controls . <p> " What about water ? " said Bug . <p> Toute passed him the Lectro . " Just a sip , " she said . " We may need the electrolytes for power . " <p> " None for me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw that even the smudge was gone . <p> He did n't tell Toute and Bug . He did n't want to alarm them . They were sitting on the floor , finishing their Pop-Tarts . The next time he looked Bug was asleep , with his head on Toute 's bent , bony little shoulder . <p> Troy wanted to tell Toute not to worry - or was it himself he wanted to reassure ? No matter : when he started to speak she smiled and put her finger to her lips . The next time Troy looked back , she was asleep too . <p> The dusty vacuum tubes still glowed hot . The fan was turned steadily , a circular shadow pulling them silently through the air . <p> Troy studied the dunes , looking for landmarks , anything that would mark their way back . Airplanes do n't leave tracks . The dunes were like waves , featureless . He searched to the left and the right , but he could n't even find their shadow passing over the sand . <p> There were a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been rabbits , or horses , or antelopes . It was hard to tell their size or shape . <p> Then they , too , were gone . <p> And it was just sand , a sea of yellow sand . <p> 5. another town <p> " Look ! " <p> Troy opened his eyes , wider . Had they been closed ? Had he been sleeping ? <p> Toute was standing at his side , holding onto his shoulder . Her grip was so strong it almost hurt . <p> " There 's something up ahead . " <p> Bug scrambled to his feet and joined them . Below the windshield , the fan was spinning away . The plane was flying smoothly , silently . <p> Ahead there was a dark smudge against the horizon . <p> " Did you turn around ? " Toute asked . <p> " No , why ? " <p> " Because ! " Because the smudge ahead looked familiar . The dark was trees . Streets , houses . As they grew closer they saw the water tower , the steeple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Toute . She sounded disappointed . " You must have turned the plane around . " <p> " I did n't turn anything , " said Troy . " Maybe it 's like Columbus . You know , all the way around the world . " <p> " Columbus did n't go all the way around the world , " said Toute . " And besides , the world is a lot bigger around than that . I hope . " <p> " There 's the courthouse , " said Bug . " Fly past it so I can see what time it is . Maybe I wo n't be late for baseball . " <p> " I 'll try , " said Troy . <p> As the sand gave way to fields , and then tree-lined streets , the plane responded to the turning of the knob . Troy turned it to the right , and the plane banked right ; left , and it banked left . Very gently . Troy was careful to keep it headed for the race track , now barely visible on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Bug asked . <p> There was no clock on the courthouse tower . <p> " That 's weird plus , " said Toute , as they flew past . <p> Everything else was the same . There was the downtown , with a few people walking around . The same people ? They were so small , it was impossible to tell . <p> There was the school , shut down for summer . The baseball diamond was no longer empty though . There were a few ballplayers , hitting flies . <p> " Whoa , I 'm late , " said Bug . <p> " It looks like they 're just starting , " said Troy . " You can still make it . " <p> " And there 's my house ! " said Toute . The driveway was empty , except for her father 's Windstar . <p> " Looks like all the doctors have gone , " said Troy . <p> " Good . You should hear them talk . They all talk in big whispers . " <p> Bug was silent , grim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old race track , still far ahead . It seemed that the plane was going slower . It was starting to descend , toward the treetops . <p> He put his hand over the tubes . " They 're not as warm as they were . " <p> " We 're losing altitude ! " said Bug , pointing at the treetops , getting closer . <p> Toute opened the Lectro bottle . There was an inch left . She poured it into the sand . <p> The tubes responded instantly , glowing brighter . The plane nosed up slightly , just clearing the last trees before the old race track . Troy turned the knob to the right and the plane started to circle over the track , going slower and slower . <p> " It knows how to land , " Troy said . " It 's like a horse ; it knows where to go . " <p> He hoped it was true . Toute and Bug did n't look convinced . <p> Lower and lower they went . The fan was turning so slowly that Troy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kept his hand on the knob but the plane followed the track on its own , gliding down over the stands . <p> The fan was spinning slower and slower ; the tubes were glowing dimmer and dimmer . <p> " Fasten your seat belts , " said Troy . <p> " What seat belts ! ? " <p> " It was a joke , Bug . " Troy held onto the edge of the shelf that held the radio ; Bug held onto the edge of the side window ; and Toute held onto both of them as the plane hit the clay track <p> It hit , bounced , hit again , bounced . The left wingtip scraped the track , raising a little cloud of dust . The plane hit again , rocked from side to side , rolled <p> And rolled to a stop . <p> Troy opened his eyes and saw Toute just opening hers . Her face was filled with a big grin , a grin that was bigger than she was . She started to clap her hands and Troy joined them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeroplane . <p> Bug opened his eyes and joined in . <p> " Hooray , " said Troy . <p> " But we 're on the wrong side of the track , " said Bug . <p> It was true . They were on the back side of the lake , in the middle of the back straightaway . <p> " So what ? " asked Toute . <p> " How will we we explain how it got here , " said Bug . " On the wrong side of the track ? " <p> " Who cares ? " said Troy . " No one knows we did it . " <p> " They 'll know now , " said Bug . <p> " Then we 'll taxi , " said Toute . She shook the last few drops of Lectro into the sand . The tubes glowed warm again . <p> The fan , still spinning , spun faster , and the aeroplane moved off at a walk , lumbering around the track with the wings dragging and the wheels creaking . The tubes died again and the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stands at the start/finish line . <p> " Later ! " Bug tossed his backpack out the side window . " I have my glove in my backpack , " he explained , climbing out after it . He stopped and looked back in . " Can you make it okay ? " <p> " I 'll help her , " said Troy . <p> " I can make it , " said Toute . " Go on ahead . " <p> Bug waved and disappeared into the tunnel , running for his bike . <p> " So here we are , " said Toute . " But .... " <p> " But what ? " <p> " Does n't it look a little different ? " <p> " The stands , " said Troy . They seemed smaller . And there was no wheelless , tipped-over hot dog cart . <p> " Maybe it 's just my imagination , " said Toute . She put her arm around Troy 's shoulder and they climbed out the back , through the outhouse/tail . It did n't stink as badly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troy . Some of the board seats were missing . He decided not to mention it ; it seemed best not to notice . <p> With Toute hanging onto his side , they went through the tunnel . It was as dark as before , and there were the machines , lurking in the darkness like waiting monsters . Two of them ; had n't there been three ? Troy was n't sure , and again , it seemed best not to notice . They hurried on through , into the sunlight on the other side . <p> " Uh oh , " said Toute . <p> The chainlink fence was gone - and worse . <p> Bug was kicking the weeds , his fists clenched . " My bicycle is gone , " he said . " Somebody stole my bicycle ! " <p> True . There was Troy 's bike , in the weeds where he had left it - but all alone . <p> " Maybe somebody found it and took it home for you , " saidTroy . Even though he did n't believe it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bike . " It was a Blizzard Trailmaster , with front and rear shocks . <p> " Let 's go , " saidTroy . " You can still make it to practice . " <p> They walked to Toute 's house , pushing Troy 's bike between them , with Toute on the handlebars ; they dropped her off , and continued to the usual tree . <p> " Go ahead and take my bike to practice , " said Troy . <p> " It 's okay , " said Bug , who clearly thought it was n't . " It 's too late anyway . " <p> True : it was getting dark . Bug waved good-bye and started walking home dejectedly . <p> Troy felt bad . But not too bad . Missing practice seemed a small price to pay for such an adventure . Bug will get over it , Troy thought . He 'll remember this and thank me someday . <p> Troy rode on home , through the darkening streets . His house was lit up when he got there . And there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive . It was a Miata ; or rather , almost a Miata . The rear end looked different , and the grill was painted instead of chromed . Maybe a custom ? <p> Troy started around the side of the house , toward the back door - and then stopped . <p> There was his father in the kitchen , talking to his mother , who was standing at the sink in a yellow dress . But he was smoking a cigarette ! And he had a little mustache . <p> Troy reached for the doorknob - then stopped again . The woman at the sink had turned around . It was n't his mother at all . She was wearing his mother 's yellow dress , but she was younger , with shorter hair and bright red lipstick . <p> Troy backed up , into the shadow of the trees , almost tripping on the crab apples that littered the ground - the same crab apples he had raked up just the day before . There was a smell of weeds and rot . He watched while his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his mother ! - who took a drag and then laughed . <p> A strange laugh , Troy thought , even though he could n't hear it through the glass . His father gave her a pat on the bottom and they both left the room . <p> Troy was frozen . He could n't move and could n't think . He did n't know where to go or what to think . It was his house , and yet it was n't . It was his father , but it was n't ; and it was not his mother at all . The kitchen , he noticed for the first time , was painted a different color , although it was the same kitchen . <p> He tried to remember what color it had been . Yellow , like the strange woman 's dress . This kitchen was more the color of sand . <p> I 'll knock on the door and demand to know what 's happening , he thought . No , I 'll slip upstairs to my room and ... No , I 'll run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what ? he was just starting to get upset when he heard a sound from the trees across the street . <p> Who-hoot . <p> Who-hoot . <p> It was a hoot owl call . Troy stepped out of the shadows and looked toward the street . <p> There was Bug . <p> " I found my bike , " he said in a loud whisper . <p> " Where was it ? Where is it ? " Bug was on foot . <p> " At home . But something is weird ! " <p> " I know , " said Troy . " Here , too . My parents are strange . And my mother is not my mother . " <p> " Come on , " said Bug . " Ride me on your bike , back to my house . I 'll show you what I mean . " <p> They rode silently through the empty streets to Bug 's house , on the other side of town . They left the bike on the street and went around to the back of the house . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to dinner . There at the table was - Bug . <p> " Uh oh , " said Troy . " That 's you . " <p> " Not me , " Bug whispered . " I 'm right here . " <p> " Who is it , then ? " The boy at the table looked exactly like Bug except that he was wearing a red shirt that said X-TREME . Bug 's T-shirt said Go AHEAD , HAVE A COW . <p> " I think it 's my brother , " said Bug . <p> " But you do n't have a brother . " <p> " I did , though . I was supposed to , " said Bug . " When I was born I had a twin , but he died . I never knew about it but my mom told me once . " <p> " And that 's him ? " <p> " She even named him , " said Bug . " His name was Travis , after my dad . That 's why I was n't named after my dad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always hated it . <p> They crept around the side of the house , by the garage . " And there 's my bike . " <p> It was leaning against the garage door . A Blizzard Trailmaster with front and rear shocks . <p> " Well , get it and let 's go , " said Troy . " Let 's get out of here . This is not our town . Something is wrong . " <p> They rode through the dark , empty streets to Toute 's house . They sneaked around to the back , but they could n't see anything . Toute 's house did n't have a kitchen window . <p> " Just go to the door , " said Bug . <p> " I 'm afraid to , " said Troy . <p> " You started all this . Plus , you 're her cousin . Nobody will think it 's weird if you knock on the door . " <p> Bug hid in the bushes while Troy rang the bell . Instead of the usual ring it played a little song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wiping her mouth with a napkin . " Fried chicken , " she said . <p> " Something is wrong , " Troy said , whispering . <p> " I know , " said Toute . " I knew it was you . Here . " She handed him something wrapped in a greasy paper napkin . <p> Bug carne out of the bushes . " What 's that ? " <p> " Fried chicken ! " <p> " We 're in the wrong place , " said Troy . " My parents are all strange . And Bug 's too . " <p> " I know , " said Toute . " Mine , too . " <p> " Who 's at the door ? " a voice called out from inside . <p> " Just some friends , " said Toute . She dropped her voice . " That was my mother . My mother is alive here . She cooked fried chicken ! And look , I can walk . " She walked in a little circle . " A little sideways , but I can walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to get out of here , " said Troy . <p> " We 're in the middle of dinner , " said Toute . " I 'm coming , Mom ! " she yelled . Then she whispered again : " You guys have to wait at the plane . I 'll come in the morning . " <p> " In the morning ? We have to go home ! " <p> " This is my only chance to see my mother , " said Toute . <p> " Can we come in and use the bathroom ? " Bug asked . <p> " No ! " Toute whispered . " You 'll ruin everything . Besides , boys can pee in the bushes . " <p> She shut the door . <p> " What if I do n't just have to pee ? " Bug grumbled . <p> They rode back to the old race track , avoiding streets that might be busy , even though few streets in their town were busy after dark . This is n't our town , Troy kept reminding himself ; notieally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would we explain who we are ? <p> They left their bikes in the weeds and entered the track through the tunnel . It was easy without the chain-link fence . The tunnel was darker and scarier than ever at night , but they knew the way and hurried through , without a word . <p> Troy felt a moment 's fear - what if the plane was gone ? How would they ever get back home ? <p> But there it was , right where they had left it , shining in the moonlight . <p> " What if it rains ? " Bug asked . " Look at those clouds . " <p> Troy looked up . He had only thought it was moonlight . There was no Moon , but the clouds high overhead were bright . It was as if they were lighted from the ground . Even the clouds here are weird , he thought . <p> " We 'll sleep in the plane , " he said . The plane was the only thing that seemed normal , unchanged . The fabric on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track . The fan in the front was still . Troy spun it with his hand ; it spun , then stopped . <p> They entered the back , through the old outhouse . It still stank , a little . " You ca n't use this outhouse , " Troy said . <p> " Huh ? " <p> " Did n't you say you needed to - you know ? " <p> " I did n't say I needed to . I said , what if I needed to . " The inside of the aeroplane was just as they had left it . Troy was relieved . The vacuum tubes were cold . The sand in the ashtray was dry . Bug threw his backpack onto the floor . " I 'm hungry , " he said . <p> " Look . " Troy unwrapped the greasy napkin Toute had given him . There were two drumsticks inside . They each had one and threw the bones outside , through the side window . <p> " I 'm still hungry , " said Bug . " Are n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " Troy found the third of a Pop-Tart he had left on the shelf by the radio . They shared it sitting on the floor of the plane . <p> " I wish we had something to drink . " <p> " Well , we do n't . " <p> " I 'm cold , " said Bug . <p> " It 's not cold , " said Troy . <p> They tried using Bug 's backpack for a pillow but it was too small for both their heads . Bug took out his glove ; it just fit the back of his head . Troy used the backpack . It was lumpy , even empty . <p> " Why is everything so weird ? " Bug asked . They lay side by side , looking up at the plywood ceiling . " If that 's my twin , does that mean I 'm dead and he 's alive ? " <p> " Do n't think about it , " said Troy . <p> " What about your mother ? " <p> " Do n't think about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been his job to make things interesting , but now he felt it was his job to make things as normal as possible . " Just go to sleep . Let 's do n't talk about it . In the morning maybe it will all look different . " <p> He did n't believe it , but he felt that he had to say it . <p> 6. good-bye ! good-bye ! <p> MORNING . Troy woke up wondering where he was , but only for a moment . The plywood ceiling of the plane brought it all back . <p> He sat up . Where was Bug ? Troy was all alone in the plane . But someone was outside , tapping on the windshield . <p> " Who 's there ? " <p> He stood up and saw Bug , outside , sitting on his bike . <p> " Bug ? " <p> " Who 's Bug ? Is he the one who stole my bike ? " <p> Troy got it . " Wait a minute , " he said . He climbed out the side window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - looked exactly like Bug , but Troy knew it was n't Bug . He was wearing an X-TREME T-shirt . <p> " He did n't steal it , " Troy said . " He just borrowed it . " <p> " I found it out in the weeds . You guys are in big trouble . My dad 's a cop . " <p> " So is Bug 's . " <p> " So what ? Who is this Bug and who are you , anyway , and what is this , some kind of airplane ? " <p> " Aeroplane , " said Troy . He introduced himself . He held out his hand for a handshake , but Bug 's twin acted like he did n't see it . <p> " I 'm Travis Michael Biggs , " he said , " and my father 's a policeman , and you are in big trouble if you think you can just steal my bike . " <p> " I told you , we just borrowed your bike , " said Troy . " And I can explain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much he should tell this different , more assertive , and slightly obnoxious Bug , when the real Bug came around the side of the plane , carrying a string of tiny fish . <p> " Bluegills ! " Bug said " We can build a fire and .... " <p> Then he saw his twin . <p> " Whoa , " he said . " It 's me . I mean , you . " <p> " Whoa , " said the twin . " Who in the hell are you ? " <p> " I 'll find us some firewood , " said Troy , " and let you two sort it out . " <p> When Troy got back with enough wood to build a fire , the two were cleaning fish , as if they had known each other all their lives . <p> " My Dad 's a cop , too , " said Bug . " His name is Travis . " <p> " That 's my dad , too , " said Travis . " I 'm named after him . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like this one ? " <p> " Almost , " Bug said . " Do you play baseball ? What position ? " <p> " First base . " <p> " I 'm a pitcher , " said Bug . " Sometimes . Sometimes a catcher , too . What 's your coach 's name ? " <p> " Blaine , " said Travis . " He 's a jerk . " <p> " Same guy , " said Bug . " I 'm afraid he wo n't let me pitch next week because I missed practice . " <p> " No-excuses Blaine , " said Travis . " Same guy . But maybe flying in an airplane is a good excuse . " <p> " Aeroplane , " said Troy . " And no grownups must know about this . They would go nuts . We have to get back before they find out about any of this . " <p> " So , it actually flies ? " <p> " It does . Do you have a match ? " <p> Once the fire was going , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a fish . Cooked down , they were no bigger than candy bars . <p> " They need salt , " said Bug . <p> " You 're not supposed to eat them anyway , " said Travis . " I just catch them and throw them back . " <p> " So do we , " said Bug . " But I was starving . Still am . " <p> " Have some Pop-Tarts then . " <p> They all looked around . It was Toute . She was reaching into her backpack . " I only brought three , but I already ate breakfast . " <p> " Me too , " said Travis , unwrapping the Pop-Tart she gave him . " But I 'll have some more . " <p> Toute seemed to notice him for the first time . " And who in the world are you ? " She frowned . " Is n't one Bug enough ? " <p> Bug explained , and Troy told what he had seen at his parents ' house . Toute nodded as if she understood . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem normal . <p> " How did you get here anyway ? " he asked . <p> Toute grinned and pointed to a bike lying on the track in front of the plane . It was a pink and white girl 's bike Troy had never seen before . <p> " You ca n't ride a bike , " Bug pointed out . <p> " I can here . Plus , I have a mother , plus - " Toute 's grin was almost too wide for her narrow face . " I can walk ! I 'm not bent . Not so bent , anyway . " <p> She walked in a little circle , just like the night before . She still limped , and dragged one foot , but it was true : she could walk . <p> " That 's great , " said Troy . " But we 've got to get out of here . " He climbed back into the airplane . Toute followed , limping in through the tail . <p> The tubes were cold . Toute dragged her fingers through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Plus one of the wingtips is broken . " <p> " The fabric ripped when we landed , " said Troy . " Maybe it 'll still fly , though . " <p> " Better to fix it , " said Toute . <p> Troy followed her out the back of the plane . She limped to the wingtip , reaching into her backpack as she walked . Troy watched , amazed . She had never been able to do either before . <p> She pulled out a tube of glue . <p> " Girls are always prepared , " she said . Troy held the fabric tight while she glued it to the wood . <p> " Good going , " he said . " But we still need Lectro . Do you have any left ? " <p> " You saw me shake out the last drops , " Toute said . She put the glue away and pointed toward the two brothers , who were sitting on the ground examining a ball glove . " I guess it 's up to the Bugsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel . There were only two soda machines , not three , but nobody except Troy seemed to notice , and he did n't point it out . Things were weird enough as it was . <p> First Bug hit the bottom of the machine , which should have made the light come on . But it did n't . Then he slammed his fist into the center of the machine , which should have dropped a coin into the coin return . But it did n't . <p> " You 're not doing it right , Clarence , " said Travis . <p> " It 's Bug . " <p> " Bug , then . Watch . " <p> Travis kicked the machine on the side and the light came on . Then he slapped the big L above the coin return , and a coin dropped down . <p> " Let me see that , " said Troy . <p> Travis tossed him the coin . <p> " There 's no hole in it ! " <p> " Of course there 's no hole in it , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Troy tossed it back , and Travis dropped it into the slot and pressed a square button . <p> A bottle fell with a thump . <p> " It 's not Lectro ! " said Bug . <p> " What 's Lectro ? " Travis opened the bottle and took a swig . " It 's Collie Cola - gooder than good . " He held out the bottle . " It 's warm , though . Here , we can share . " <p> Troy grabbed it . " No way . That 's our ticket home . If it works . " <p> " It 'll work , " said Toute , grabbing it from Troy . " It 's like everything else here , the same only different . " <p> Troy climbed into the plane and Toute handed him the bottle of Collie Cola through the side window . He poured a thin stream of brown liquid into the sand . <p> Nothing happened . <p> " More , " said Toute . <p> He poured in half the bottle . <p> " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his fingertips . The tubes started to glow . <p> " See ? It 's working , " Toute said . She touched the fan and it started to spin - slowly at first , then faster . <p> " Come on , get in , you guys ! " Troy said . <p> " This thing actually flies ? " asked Travis . <p> " That 's the idea , " said Troy . " Come on , Bug , Toute . Get in . Let 's go . " <p> Bug was standing beside his twin on the clay race track . Except for their T-shirts , they looked even more alike than ever . <p> They both looked confused . They both spoke at the same time : <p> " I wish you would come . It would be cool to have a twin brother . " <p> " I wish you would stay . It would be cool to have a twin brother . " <p> Troy and Toute both laughed . Bug and Travis did n't . <p> " What I mean is , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No way ! " said Troy . " We do n't know if this thing will even fly again with this stuff . How do we know it will carry four ? " <p> " You could stay here , then , " said Travis . <p> " What about my mom and dad ? " <p> " Same problem here , " said Travis . <p> " Maybe we should switch for a day . But wait , I 'm supposed to pitch on Sunday . " <p> " Not if you miss practice , " said Travis . " No excuses ! " <p> " Forget switching , " said Troy , pouring another inch of Collie Cola into the sand . The fan was turning faster and faster . " There 's no way to know we could ever find this place again . " <p> The wheels creaked ; the floor lurched under Troy 's feet - the plane was starting to move . <p> " Whoa ! " Bug scrambled in through the side window , and Travis passed him his backpack . <p> Then Travis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bug . " Swap , " he said . Bug took off his GO AHEAD , HAVE A COW T-shirt and tossed it to Travis . <p> " What is this , a strip tease ? " said Toute . <p> " If you ever want a brother , just look in the mirror , " said Travis . " Cool , " said Bug . " I will . " <p> " Come on , Toute ! " said Troy . The plane was starting to roll slowly down the track . The wingtips were bobbing up and down . <p> Toute walked alongside , shaking her head . " I do n't think so . " <p> " What ! ? " <p> " I 'm staying here , " she said , picking up her bike . <p> " You ca n't stay here ! You do n't belong here . This is not our real town . " <p> " Yes , it is . It 's just as real . And here I can ride a bike . " <p> As if to prove it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Toute , no ! " Troy pleaded . The plane was going faster and faster . " If you stay here , what about me ? I 'll never see you again . I ca n't come back to get you . I 'll get in trouble . They 'll say I left you here . " <p> " Left me where ? Nobody knows where I am . They probably think I 'm at the mall . Nobody knows I 'm with you . " <p> " What about your dad ? " <p> " He 'll get over it . Plus I have a mother here , remember ? And my dad is here . " <p> " Not the same dad . " <p> " Pretty much the same . " <p> " You ca n't do this ! " <p> " Why not ! " <p> " Because - " Troy could think of a hundred reasons : Because you are part of me . Because we are like brother and sister . Because I love you . But none he could say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to , " said Toute . " I can walk here and ride a bike . Back home , it 's just getting worse and worse . I can hear them whispering all the time . " <p> " Do n't ! " The plane was picking up speed , lumbering toward the first turn . <p> " Steer , Troy ! " said Bug . " We 'll hit the wall . " <p> " I will miss you , " Toute said , pedaling faster and faster . " You are my best friend . But hey , maybe there 's a you here . " <p> " There is n't ! There 's not ! " <p> " If there is I 'll find him . But you have to steer , Troy , look out ! " <p> The left wingtip was scraping the weeds at the side of the track . <p> Troy turned the knob to the right , and the plane angled into the first turn , still picking up speed . <p> " Good luck ! " said Travis , catching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The floor stopped bouncing . The plane began to rise off the ground . <p> Toute was pedaling faster and faster . Troy was impressed . But she was falling behind <p> " What do I tell your dad ? " <p> " Nothing , " said Toute , out of breath . " I 've already told him . Good-bye , Troy . I 'll never forget you , ever , even if I do find another you . And thanks . " <p> " Thanks ? " <p> " For discovering the aeroplane ! " <p> " Bye , Travis ! " Bug yelled . " Bye , Toute . " They were rising off the track , leaving Travis and Toute behind . When they circled back around , higher and higher , they could see them , standing in the center of the track by their bicycles , looking up and waving . <p> Then the plane made a broad circle out over the town , and they were left behind , too small to see . <p> 7. flying home <p> TROY REMEMBERED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courthouse to the race track . So he left the same way , flying between the steeple and the water tower , past the clockless courthouse , straight over the town . <p> They left the streets and trees behind , then the fields . Soon they were flying over trackless dunes again . <p> " Are you sure this is the right way ? " Bug asked . <p> " Sure , " said Troy . He was n't . And Bug knew he was n't . They both just wanted to hear him say he was . So he said it again . " Sure I 'm sure . " <p> The desert was just sand with an occasional stretch of bare rock , scarred as if by huge claws . The tubes glowed , the fan whirred silently , and the plane flew along at a slow , steady pace , not much faster than a bicycle . <p> " We should have brought some Pop-Tarts , " said Bug . " What if we crash ? We 'll starve . " <p> " You do n't starve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just crash . It sort of ends everything . " <p> Troy kept the notch straight up . He was pretty sure this was the way home . But what if the wind blew him off course ? <p> There seemed to be a wind . Below , he could see little puffs of sand along the tops of the dunes . And the occasional bush , in a hollow between two dunes , was shaking as if angry . <p> And there was a yellow wall of clouds dead ahead . <p> " It 's a storm , " said Bug . <p> " Sand storm , " said Troy . As if calling it by its right name would make it any better . <p> " Can we go around it ? " <p> Troy shook his head . " I 'll lose my bearings . " <p> He kept the notch straight up ; they flew straight into the storm . It was all around them , blowing not water and rain but gritty yellow sand . The plane was rocking from side to side . Bug was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his balance . <p> He gave up and sat on the floor . " I think we 're going to crash , " he said . " I still wish we had some Pop-Tarts . What if we survive ? " <p> " Shut up , " said Troy . He could barely see out of the windshield . It seemed that the plane was going slower . The wingtips were shaking slowly , up and down . The fabric was rippling , though Toute 's repair seemed to be holding . <p> Then he could n't see the wingtips anymore . He could n't see the fan . Everything was yellow , yellow sand . The tubes were looking dim , or was that his imagination ? he looked at the Collie Cola bottle . There was less than half a bottle left . A lot less . <p> Suddenly there was a break in the yellow cloud , and Troy saw white rocks , dead ahead . Was it a mountain , or were they going down ? He poured the rest of the brown liquid into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of the plane picked up . The right wing dropped , and the rocks were gone . <p> " We 're turning , " said Bug . <p> Troy wished he would shut up . Bug was becoming the bearer of bad news . " I know . " <p> There did n't seem to be any point in standing at the controls , since the plane did what it wanted to do anyway . And it was hard to breathe . Troy had sand in his eyes , and it gritted between his teeth . <p> Bug was on the floor , looking like a bandit , with the collar of Travis 's X-TREME T-shirt pulled up over his nose . Troy sat on the floor beside him , and covered his nose with his own T-shirt , which did n't say anything . He could breathe but he could hardly see . <p> There was nothing to see anyway . He closed his eyes . The plane circled higher and higher , shaking , creaking and groaning , through the storm . <p> Then all was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sand was gone , except for the grit in his eyes and on the floor and between his teeth . <p> He wiped his eyes and stood up . <p> They were still circling , in calm cold air . The stars shone high overhead like little chips of ice . " I 'm cold , " said Bug , waking up . He joined Troy at the controls . <p> The sandstorm was like a yellow smudge far below . It was still daylight down there . For some reason , Troy found this encouraging . <p> He tried the knob , left , then right . The plane dipped its wings , left , then right . Troy centered the knob and it straightened out . They were flying straight again - but straight to where ? <p> Then Bug , the bearer of bad news , brought some good news . " Look ! " Far off to the left , there was a dark spot on the horizon . Our town ? Troy wondered . <p> There was only one way to find out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane toward it . <p> " Think that 's our town ? " Bug asked . <p> " For sure , " Troy lied . <p> The boys held their breath , waiting and watching . Hoping . The plane was descending . <p> The smudge on the horizon grew into a blur of trees and streets and houses , looking more and more familiar . There was the courthouse , and the water tower , and the church steeple . <p> Still descending , the plane flew past the courthouse . Both Troy and Bug were relieved to see that it had a clock . <p> Itwas 1:37 . <p> " I can still make it to baseball , " Bug said . <p> " A day late , " Troy reminded him . As soon as he said it , he wished he had n't . <p> " Maybe Blaine wo n't notice , " he added lamely . <p> There were a few people on the street , but they did n't look up as the plane flew over . If they did , what would they seel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bread and candy , cars and cola . The fuselage , a long square plywood tube , open on one side . Wire wheels spinning slowly in the onrushing air . A V tail , slightly cockeyed , and the propeller , a ceiling fan , turning slower and slower as they descended . <p> " There 's your house , Toute , " said Troy . Then he remembered that she was no longer with them . <p> " Look at all those cars , " said Bug . <p> Toute 's driveway and the street in front of her house were packed with parked cars . <p> Troy saw what looked like his father 's car - not the little sportscar , but the big white Olds . He looked down at the crowd of people at the door , trying to see if his parents were among them . It was hard to tell . They were all dressed alike , in suits and ties . <p> " Hey ! Pay attention , " said Bug . <p> Troy looked out the front . The plane was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last row of trees before the old race track . <p> Troy turned the dial to the left , and then to the right , banking the plane between two trees . He leveled off with the stands dead ahead . With the last drop of Collie Cola , he brought the nose up , barely missing the top row of seats . <p> " We 're going to hit the lake , " Bug said . " And drown . " <p> " It 's not deep enough , " said Troy . " Shut up and fasten your seat belt . " <p> He spun the dial and dropped the left wing . The wingtip scraped the track and the plane landed sideways , skidding , teetering first on one wheel , and then on the other . <p> CRUNCH ! <p> Everything was dark . It 's always dark like this down among the roots , Troy thought , where the Teeny-Weenies live . It 's okay , though . Toute knows the way . " Let 's go back up , " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You go on , " she said . <p> " I do n't know the way . " <p> " Sureyoudo . " <p> " Come on ! " said Bug . <p> Hus ? <p> It was light . Bug was dragging him out of the back of the plane . <p> " Hey ! You 're getting splinters in my butt ! " <p> " You crashed us ! " Bug said . " It 's going to burn ! " <p> " Let go of me ! It 's not full of gas , it runs on water and sand . How can it burn ? " <p> " I guess you know everything , " said Bug , dropping him . " I was trying to save your life . " <p> " Sorry . Thanks . " Troy stood up , his feet slipping . The track was muddy . The ground felt funny , after the air . <p> The plane was a mess . One wing had come off and landed in the mud along the infield , where it looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuselage , which was half in and half out of the infield . The tail was tipped over , like a fallen outhouse . <p> " Looks like there 's been a storm here , too , " said Troy . " Are you okay ? " <p> " I 'm okay , but I 'm late . " Bug was already heading for the tunnel , his backpack over his shoulder . <p> Troy followed him across the track and into the tunnel . They splashed through water at the bottom . The drink machines were dark , like sentinels . There were three of them . Outside , the hole under the chain link fence was filled with water from the storm . <p> They climbed over instead of under . <p> Their bikes gleamed in the weeds , looking like they had just been washed . Bug got on his Blizzard and bounced the wheels , as if making sure it was real . " I can still make practice if I hurry . " <p> " Go , then . " <p> " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . I 'll think of something . " <p> But the fact was , it was hard to think of anything . The place where Toute had been was like a hole in Troy 's thoughts as he rode toward home . Her memory was like a dark patch he could n't look into - but could n't look away from , either . <p> " Where have you been ! " Troy 's father demanded , when he opened the door . Troy could n't look at him ; he kept remembering the little mustache . <p> He looked away . <p> " It 's okay . " His father squeezed his shoulder in that way that fathers do . " I know you are upset . Your mother is over at William 's house now . I was there all day . " <p> William was Troy 's dad 's brother , Toute 's father . <p> " Toute - " Troy began . <p> " Toute died peacefully in her sleep , " said Troy 's father . " William was waiting for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew for a week , he said . I 'm surprised she had n't said anything to you . You two are so close . Were so close . Anyway , get dressed . Your mother is already there , and we are expected for the memorial . She laid your suit and tie out on your bed . Get dressed and I 'll help you tie your tie . " <p> 8 : almost home <p> TROY HARDLY RECOGNIZED Toute at the funeral , she looked so still and so straightened out . He tried to cry because everyone else was crying , but he could n't . So he just sat with his eyes almost closed . It was like getting through a sandstorm . <p> In the days that followed he missed her , but he knew where she was . He even knew what it was like there , and what she was doing : riding her bike . Eating fried chicken . <p> Troy was in far less trouble than he had expected . He was surprised to find that his parents thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble , either . He told his parents he had spent the night with Troy after they had been caught in the storm . Luckily , the phone lines had been down all night . <p> It was several days before the two boys met at the usual tree and rode to the old race track on the outskirts of town . The drink machines still lurked like monsters in the tunnel , but when Bug kicked the center one , no light came on . <p> " The rain must have ruined it , " Bug said . He was wearing the X-TREME T-shirt . No one had noticed , he said . <p> Troy was n't surprised . " Grownups never really read T-shirts , " he said . <p> The aeroplane was in pieces on the track and in the infield . The track was still muddy in spots . <p> One good effect of the storm : the scum was almost all gone from the lake . We may have to change the name , Troy thought . It was n't Scum Lake anymore . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the end of the dock . He could see all the way to the bottom . There was a concrete block , and a tire . Then , as he watched , a great blunt shape swam out of the shadows and stopped , right under him . <p> He started to call Bug , but did n't . It was better to be silent and watch . He wished Toute were there to see it . She would have liked it . She had always liked it when weird things got real . <p> IMG
