Every Tuesday at eleven o'clock in the morning , Eugenie Carson descended the steps of the Sweetgum Public Library and made her way to Tallulah 's CafT on the town square . In the past , she would have eaten the diet plate  --  cottage cheese and a peach half  --  in solitary splendor . Then she would have returned to her job running the library , just as she 'd done for the last forty years . <br> On this humid September morning , though , Eugenie was meeting someone for lunch  --  her new husband , Rev. Paul Carson , pastor of the Sweetgum Christian Church . Eugenie smiled at the thought of Paul waiting for her at the cafT . They might both be gray haired and near retirement , but happiness was happiness , no matter what age you found it . <br> Eugenie entered the square from the southeast corner . The antebellum courthouse anchored the middle , while Kendall 's Department Store occupied the east side to her right . She walked along the south side of the square , past Callahan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and crossed the street to the cafT . The good citizens of Sweetgumwere already arriving at Tallulah 's for lunch . Eugenie passed the cafT , heading up the western side of the square . She had a brief errand to do before she met her husband . Two doors down , she could see the sign for Munden 's Five-and-Dime . Her business there should n't take long . <br> Before she reached Munden 's , a familiar figure emerged from one of the shops and blocked the sidewalk . <br> Hazel Emerson . President of the women 's auxiliary at the Sweetgum Christian Church and self-appointed judge and jury of her fellow parishioners . <br> " Eugenie . " Hazel smiled , but the expression , coupled with her rather prominent eyeteeth , gave her a wolfish look . Hazel was on the heavy side , a bit younger than Eugenie 's own sixty five years , and her hair was dyed an unbecoming shade of mink . <br> Hazel smiled , but there was no pleasantness in it . " Just the person I wanted to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distaste for the woman show . " Good morning , Hazel , " she replied . " How are you ? " <br> " Distressed , Eugenie . Thoroughly distressed . " <br> " I 'm sorry to hear that . " Eugenie truly was dismayed , but not from worry over Hazel 's discomfort . <br> " Yes , well , you have the power to calm the waters , " Hazel said with the same false smile . " In a manner of speaking , at least . " <br> Since Eugenie 's marriage to Paul only a few weeks before , she 'd learned how demanding Hazel could be.The other woman called the parsonage at all hours and appeared in Paul 's office at least once a day . Although Eugenie had known Hazel casually for years , she 'd never had to bother with her much . Eugenie could n't remember Hazel ever having entered the library . <br> " How can I help you ? " Eugenie said in her best librarian 's voice . She had uttered the phrase countless times over the last forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interested but not enmeshed . Solicitous but not overly involved . <br> " Well , Eugenie , you must know that many people in the church are distressed by your marriage to Paul . " <br> " Really ? " Eugenie kept the pleasant smile on her face and continued to breathe evenly . " I 'm sorry to hear that . " <br> " Oh , not me , of course , " Hazel said and pressed a hand to her ample chest . " I 'm perfectly delighted . But some people Well , they have concerns . " <br> " What concerns would those be ? " Eugenie asked with measured calm . <br> Hazel glanced to the right and to the left , then leaned forward to whisper in a conspiratorial fashion . " Some of them are n't sure you 're a Christian , " she said . Then she straightened and resumed her normal tone of voice . " As I said , I 'm not one of them , but I thought I should tell you . For your own good , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Eugenie certainly did , far more than Hazel would guess . Eugenie was n't new to small-town gossip . Heaven knew she 'd heard her share , and even been the target of some , over the last forty years . She 'd known that her marriage to Paul would cause some comments , but she had n't expected this blatant response . <br> " I 'm mentioning it because I do n't think it would be difficult to put people 's fears to rest , " Hazel said . Her smug expression needled Eugenie . " I know you 've been attending worship , and that 's a wonderful start . " Hazel quickly moved from interfering to patronizing . " The women 's auxiliary meets on Tuesday mornings . If you joined us  --  " <br> " I 'm afraid that 's not possible , " Eugenie answered . She was determined to keep a civil tongue in her head if it killed her . " I have to work . " <br> " For something this important , I 'm sure you could find someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip on her handbag . In an emergency , no doubt she could arrange something . But this was n't an emergency . It was manipulation . <br> " Hazel  --  " <br> " Particularly at this time , " Hazel said , barely stopping for breath . " With all the losses we 've had in these last few months Well , our community needs leadership . Our church needs leadership . " She gave Eugenie a meaningful look . <br> Eugenie paused to consider her words carefully . " It has been a difficult summer , " she began . " Tom Munden 's death was so unexpected , and then to lose Frank Jackson like that . And now , with Nancy St. Clair " <br> " So you see why it 's more important than ever that you prove to church members that their pastor has n't made a grave mistake . " <br> " I hardly think that my attending a meeting of the women 's auxiliary will offer much comfort to the grieving . " Nor would it convince anyone of her status as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof . They were looking for Eugenie to grovel for acceptance . <br> Hazel sniffed . " Do n't be difficult , Eugenie . You 're being unrealistic if you expect people to accept you as a Christian after forty years of never darkening the door of any sanctuary in this town . " <br> " I 've always felt that faith is a private matter . " That was the sum of any personal information Eugenie was willing to concede to Hazel . " I prefer to let my actions speak for me . " <br> " There are rumblings , " Hazel said darkly . " Budget rumblings . " <br> " What do you mean ? " <br> " People need to have full confidence in their pastor , Eugenie . Otherwise they 're less motivated to support the church financially . " <br> Eugenie bit her tongue . She could n't believe Hazel Emerson was standing here , in the middle of the town square , practicing the most blatant sort of extortion . <br> " Are you threatening me ? " Eugenie asked , incredulous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be silly . I 'm merely cautioning you . As a Christian and as a friend . " <br> Eugenie wanted to reply that Hazel did n't appear to be filling either role very well , but she refrained . <br> " I 'll take your concerns under advisement , " she said to Hazel with forced pleasantness . " I 'm sure you mean them in the kindest possible way . " <br> " Of course I do . How else would I mean them ? " <br> " How else , indeed ? " Eugenie muttered under her breath . <br> " Well , I wo n't keep you . " Hazel nodded . " Have a nice day , Eugenie . " <br> " You too , Hazel . " The response was automatic and helped Eugenie to cover her true sentiments . She stood in place for a long moment as Hazel moved past her , on her way to stir up trouble in some other quarter , no doubt . Then , with a deep breath , Eugenie forced herself to start moving toward Munden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult , stepping into this unfamiliar role as a pastor 's wife . Paul had assured her that he had no expectations , that she should do what she felt was right . But Eugenie wondered if he had any idea of the trouble Hazel Emerson was stirring up right under his nose . True , she had n't attended church for forty years . After she and Paul had ended their young romance , she 'd blamed God for separating them . If Paul had n't felt called to the ministry , if he had n't refused to take her with him when he went to seminary , if she had n't stubbornly insisted on going with him or ending their relationship <br> Last year she and Paul had found each other again , all these decades later , and she 'd thought the past behind them . But here it was once more in the person of Hazel Emerson , raising troubling questions . Threatening Paul . Forcing Eugenie to examine issues she 'd rather leave unanswered . <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
