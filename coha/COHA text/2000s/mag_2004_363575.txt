Ryan Seacrest knows what you think of him . Knows it , because he pretty much thinks the same thing . Lightweight ? " Let 's face it , " he says of his TV-hosting career . " It 's not brain surgery . " Superficial pretty boy ? When The Simple Life co-star Nicole Richie told him , on his new syndicated daytime show On-Air with Ryan Seacrest , that her most important possession was her flatiron , he replied , " Oh , sister , trust me , I know . It 's the only thing I have in my bathroom . That and Cosmo . " <P> Seacrest , 29 , delivers all this with his signature grin  --  bright , square-jawed , as wide as the grille on a ' 65 Cadillac  --  because lightweight and superficial have been very , very good to him . He spent a decade apprenticing , first in local Atlanta radio , then doing gigs on a kids ' version of American Gladiators , Talk Soup and Extra . Now he has parlayed his Idol success into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smash talent hunt , which returns this week , he has also taken over the radio institution American Top 40 from host Casey Kasem , and last week he launched On-Air , a variety " infotainment " ( Seacrest 's word , and proudly ) show  --  which he made sure to own a piece of . <P> If all goes well , On-Air will ensure Seacrest a future in TV long after Idol and the ministrations of his hair stylist ( who has been spiking and streaking his fronds since the Extra days ) have failed him . At the University of Georgia , Seacrest majored in not just broadcasting but also business . " You ca n't be successful and have longevity in this business , " he says , " if you do n't have a business plan . " Under Seacrest 's thoroughly Larry King and Dick Clark , and Seacrest turned to the latter for advice on how to transform a spiffy smile and an affinity for what the kids like into a TV-production empire . <P> Like a cub reporter aspiring to be the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying for a job that no longer exists . Young listeners have many more influences than they did in the hitmaking days of American Bandstand , and music itself has less of a monopoly on youth culture . Now it is part of an amorphous entertainment blob in which the boundaries between TV , movie and music stardom are fuzzier than ever  --  a fact best exemplified by reality-TV shows such as Idol and the crossover celebrities they create . <P> On-Air adapts itself to this world with a mix of personality interviews ( Donald Trump , Reba McEntire ) , in-studio performances ( Missy Elliott , Enrique Iglesias ) and celeb gossip . It 's like Total Request Live but older , or Entertainment Tonight but with more screaming fans . Granted , nobody asked for either one , and On-Air was shaky in its first week . Seacrest may be better suited to the more controlled Idol than to unpredictable live variety . When Richie brought a pair of goats with her to plug her rural reality show , one of the beasts did what well-fed goats do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvised a zinger out of the barnyard blooper ; Seacrest just seemed icked out .
