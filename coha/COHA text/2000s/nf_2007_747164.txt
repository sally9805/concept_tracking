Section : BIOMECHANICS At top speed , an elephant does not run  --  by traditional standards  --  but it does n't walk either . <p> Do elephants run , or just walk briskly ? According to many biomechanists  --  and the judges of Olympic racewalkers  --  an animal is running , not walking , when at some point in each stride all of its feet  --  two or four of them  --  are off the ground at once . Of course , for anyone who has faced charging elephants , the semantics of such things do n't much matter : running or walking , a herd of elephants can cause heart palpitations . But the question is still worth asking , because when it comes to the way elephants move , the traditional distinction between running and walking is n't very informative . Besides going airborne , what else might mark the transition from amble to jog ? <p> For openers , think about what happens when you take a leisurely walk . With each step , you plant a relatively straight leg on the ground . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity up and over the highest point of an arc centered on your foot . So a walking leg is like an upside-down pendulum , and your hip rises to its highest point in mid-stance . <p> Running is almost the reverse . When all your weight is on one foot , in mid-stance , your hip dips to its lowest point in the running cycle . That difference in hip position reflects a fundamental difference in the way energy is transferred and stored . Instead of transferring forward momentum into driving an inverted pendulum , your leg , in running , acts like a coiled spring . First it compresses , storing the energy of your body 's falling mass as your foot lands on the ground . Then your leg rebounds , releasing the stored energy and propelling your body upward and onward . <p> You might think that by now biologists would know full well how pachyderms prance . In fact , though , there are surprisingly few believable measures of their top speed , much less clear conceptions of the gait by which they max out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties and dangers . Zoo elephants make poor study subjects , simply because they have already been selected for being unlikely to zoom around their enclosures at high speed . And there are n't many places where elephants can be safely raced for a substantial distance in a straight line . John R. Hutchinson , a biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College in London , and his collaborators faced those challenges with a video camera , experienced mahouts , and an international array of elephants  --  ranging from yearlings to sixty-year-old mommas  --  to determine whether elephants do more than walk . <p> Elephant legs , like primate legs , act like upside-down pendulums when their owners heave them forward in a slow walk ( left ) . The hip ( or shoulder ) rises to its highest point when the foot below it is planted on the ground . As the foot pushes off , the hip or shoulder falls until the next foot is planted . <p> Hutchinson and his colleagues painted white dots on the hips and shoulders of both Asian ( Elephas maximus ) and African ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled conditions in Asia , Europe , and North America . The results debunked reports that some elephants could move at an astonishing twenty-five miles an hour . The top measured speed was about fifteen miles an hour  --  still quite brisk , but no faster than a reasonably fit person could run in terror . <p> What about running ? Hutchinson clearly demonstrated that at no time does the entire elephant leave the ground . The animal does get three feet off the ground at once , but an Olympic judge for racewalking would still be happy with that gait . Hutchinson points out , however , that by other definitions , Jumbo is running . <p> Video analysis of the white dots of paint shows that in slow gaits the elephant 's hip rises after the foot is planted , just as it does in a walking person . In the fast gait , however , the hip continues falling after footfall , and rebounds before the toe comes off the ground . That is consistent with the idea that the limbs are shifting from a pendulum-dominated walking gait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taken as units , the fast-moving forelimbs and hind limbs each have an aerial phase , so you could say that both ends of the elephant run , but not at the same time . ( Work not yet published by Hutchinson indicates that the shoulders do n't undergo the same springlike compression as the hips , though . ) <p> You might think that the elephant 's peculiar way of " running " arose solely because of its huge size . But consider the white rhinoceros , the second-largest land animal , which can weigh more than 5,000 pounds . That 's half as much as an adult African elephant . Yet the rhinoceros runs exactly like a horse  --  a really big , nearly blind , very grumpy horse . All four of its feet leave the ground , springing the behemoth forward from step to step . <p> Compare that with the gait of a baby elephant . A month-old baby , with a sprightly weight of 250 pounds , is fully able to charge along as fast as its full-grown parents  --  often a little faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant legs may simply not be suited to aerialism , or perhaps the running style is hardwired into the nervous system . But whatever the case , a growing elephant does not follow a progression of running styles from zebra-style to Cape buffalo to rhinoceros ; it runs to type its whole life . <p> Faster-moving elephants change their hip movements . Instead of swinging like a pendulum , each leg acts more like a spring . In that gait , the hip dips to its lowest point when the foot is planted , then springs upward when the foot pushes off the ground . Although all four feet never leave the ground at the same time , both front and back " ends " of the elephant do . <p> By Adam Summers <p> Illustrations by Tom Moore <p> <p> Adam Summers ( asummers@uci.edu ) is an associate professor of bioengineering and of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California , Irvine . <p>
