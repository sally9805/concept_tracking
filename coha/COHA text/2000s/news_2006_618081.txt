<p> Summer fairly erupts with opportunities to sit , sip and nosh the day ( or night ) away in the fresh air of a festival , concert or special event of your choosing . Whether it 's a chilled malvasia bianco with chicken salad while groovin ' to George Benson at Chastain ( he returns to the amphitheater Aug. 4 ) or letting a cork from a bottle of Pommery Champagne fly while watching the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra in Piedmont Park ( 7:30 p.m . July 1 and July 30 ) , summertime is the right time for drinking wine outside . . . sometimes even in the street . <p> One of my most memorable al fresco wine events happened just about a year ago . My wife and two daughters were taking in the sights , sounds and sand at the annual Decatur Beach Party ( this year 's version is 5 p.m. - midnight Friday in downtown Decatur ; adults $5 , children 12 and under free ) . We set up camp in the middle of Ponce de Leon Avenue  --  closed to traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of Still Cruzin ' . The kids rejoiced in the 60 tons of sand also in the middle of the street ( ca n't have a beach party without sand , right ? ) . I was happy because I had a bottle of my favorite pink wine : Vin Gris de Cigare from Bonny Doon Vineyard , which went smashingly well with the fried chicken sandwiches and various other festival foods . <p> Besides the band 's convincing renditions of James Brown 's " Papa 's Got a Brand New Bag , " one of the night 's most enjoyable aspects was the format that the wine came in : a screwtop . A simple twist of the wrist and we were drinking great wine and listening to the Godfather of Soul ( sort of ) . <p> Now , I 've been told by Lee Ann Harvey with Volunteer Decatur , one of the beach party organizers , that not only was the wine a clear violation of festival policy , but the glass container was a no-no , too . Far be it from me to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good this year and patronize the festival 's wine vendors . She did invite me , my family and our wine back for Decatur 's September concert series , which has a more relaxed policy regarding personal beer and wine . <p> But Harvey and the contraband police may have their work cut out for them Friday . If I was planning on sneaking in wine this year ( which I am not ! ) , I 'd turn to the ever-so-sneaky  --  and ever-more-practical  --  wine packaging format : boxed wine . <p> Boxed wine is a misnomer . It 's really wine in a specially lined bag with a rubber spout to let the wine out . The bags are put into cardboard boxes with handles that make life easier for wine lovers on the go . Similarly , we 're starting to see specially lined , lightweight , easy-to-dispose-of cartons to keep your wine fresh , reduce your load and prevent accidental shattering whether you are hiking up Kennesaw Mountain or schlepping coolers from the parking lot . <p> While there 's nothing particularly wrong with cartons  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag has a couple of distinct advantages . First and foremost , you can keep your wine fresh three weeks or so after opening . The enemy of wine is air . Give a bottle or a carton of wine a couple of days in the fresh air , and you soon have vinaigrette sauvignon . But with boxed wines , the bag collapses inside the box as the liquid pours out , keeping that insidious air at bay . <p> The other charming aspect of boxed wines is that you can toss the box and keep the bag full of wine . This makes room for a couple of more ham sandwiches in your backpack . It also makes your wine nearly invisible to untrained bag inspectors at summertime festivals with rules against bringing in your own . . . that is , if you were dumb enough to flout clearly stated festival guidelines . <p> Recently , I picked up several boxes and a couple of cartons of wine that you should not consider trying to smuggle into the Decatur Beach Party ( or any other venue prohibiting such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other lawns , meadows and mountaintops where you can spread out your blanket and break out your boxed wine without breaking the law . <p> Gil Kulers is a wine and food educator based in Smoke Rise . <p> winekulers@aol.com <p> WINE RECOMMENDATIONS <p> Note : Wines are rated on a scale ranging from thumbs down , one thumb mostly up , one thumb up , two thumbs up , two thumbs way up and golden thumb award . These are suggested retail prices as provided by the winery , one of its agents or a local distributor . <p> 2004 Three Thieves Bandit , Pinot Grigio California <p> $8/1 liter <p> Two thumbs up <p> This wine in a carton is seemingly made by a recipe , but a good recipe . It has plenty of refreshing , spritzy acidity and lots of simple lime and tangerine fruit . <p> Hardys Stamp of Australia Chardonnay , South Eastern Australia <p> $17/3 liters <p> One thumb barely up <p> Lots of oak aromas and oak flavors cover up what seem to be pleasant flavors of green apples and Bosc pears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter with this wine about 18 months ago . <p> 2004 Black Box Wines Shiraz , Barossa Valley , Australia <p> $23/3 liters <p> Two thumbs up <p> Perhaps it was different room temperatures or a sunnier disposition , but I 'd swear this got better after being open for a couple of days . Harsher edges vanished , leaving rich flavors of tar , blackberry jam and blueberry , with aromas of violets . <p> 2005 Black Box Wines Chardonnay , Monterey County , Calif . <p> $20/3 liters <p> One thumb up <p> Pleasant aroma of lime , spices and flowers reinforced by similar refreshing , brisk flavors with a dash of ripe pineapple and a moderately long finish . It 'd be tough for a $5 regular-size bottle to touch this . <p> 2003 Target Wine Cube Cabernet/Shiraz , California <p> $10/1.5 liters <p> One thumb up <p> Way better than a wine from a discount retailer should taste ! It had flavors of ripe blackberries and notes of cloves and black pepper . It lacked in the acidity department , but just a bit . Chill slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic partner . <p> 2004 French Rabbit Pinot Noir , Vin de Pays d'Oc , France <p> $10/1 liter <p> One thumb up <p> Smells like a pinot noir with an earthy raspberry quality but lacks some acidity and has some aggressive tannins right out of the carton . Two hours later , fruit was brighter and tannins rounder . <p> PICKING THE RIGHT BOX <p> Buying a box of wine may seem as foreign as figuring out offside rules in soccer , but here are some suggestions to keep in mind before you take a chance on boxed wine : <p> * Moderate your expectations . Boxed wines have come a long way and most wo n't disappoint , but very few , if any , will take you to the heights of Mount Bacchus . <p> * Beware of dusty boxes . Boxed wines do last weeks after they are opened , but they have a shelf life shorter than bottles before they are opened . The interior lining is prone to break down over time , creating a stale , chemical aroma and taste . So drink them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not all boxed wines are created equal . In general , today 's wave of better boxed wines comes in 3-liter ( 4 regular bottles ) and 1.5-liter containers . The boxed wines of yesteryear , which are still pretty awful , come in 4- and 5-liter boxes and may be stocked right next to today 's much-improved versions . Plan to spend at least $15 for a 3-liter box .
