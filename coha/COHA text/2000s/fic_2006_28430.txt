The Men I Did n't Marry By Janice Kaplan &; Lynn Schnurnberger Random House Janice Kaplan &; Lynn Schnurnberger My husband does n't even wait until we 're in the car to drop his bombshell . We 've just brought our daughter-the brilliant , beautiful , and beloved Emily-to her first day at Yale . I 've met her roommate , unpacked her duffels , and made the bed with the soft sheets we got during our four-hour precollege shopping marathon at Bed Bath &; Beyond . Okay , I did n't really use the sheets Emily and I bought together . I picked up a better set at the exclusive Frette store on Madison Avenue to surprise her . The girl got into Yale , darn it ; she should n't sleep on anything less than 600-count sateen . Bill , the ever-doting father , jokes around with Emily while he sets up her computer and assembles a bookshelf next to her desk . As long as we 're both puttering at our little tasks , we can put off the emotional breakdown , sure to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our now very quiet house . Emily kisses her dad to thank him for his help , gives me a big hug , and then promises us she 'll be okay . Our cue to leave . With less surety , I say we 'll be okay , too . Now that our second child has officially become a college student , just like her big brother , Adam , our empty nest could n't get any emptier . On the way out of the dorm , we pass the freshmancounselor 's " Welcome " table , stacked high with campus maps , orientation bulletins , and two bowls , one filled with Tootsie Roll pops and the other with condoms . Bad idea to offer all that candy-too easy to gain the freshman fifteen . And , oh my god , that other bowl , brimming with ribbed , rainbow-colored , and glow-in-the-dark protection . Should I warn Emily to steer clear of any boy who reaches for the Star Wars condoms ? Bill and I step outside and I grab onto his arm and take a deep breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left Emily off at preschool , but we seem to have made it through . " I think we did fine , honey , " I say , proud that I have n't cried once . " We sure did . We raised a great kid , " he says , distractedly patting my hand . He 's right . Both of us were young when we started our family , but we raised two terrific kids and had fun being parents . But now 's the time for Bill and me to have new adventures together . I 've planned a wine-tasting weekend , a romantic getaway to a four-star Vermont inn , and I 've even snagged season tickets to the Knicks . Knowing this day would come , I 'd been on the waiting list to get them for six years . I look over at my successful stockbroker husband . He 's always been handsome , but I realize he 's in better shape than ever . The love handles are gone , and so are the muffin tops-the new bakery euphemism for that extra roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefs . His abs could make the cover of Men 's Health-well , an inside page , anyway . And wait a minute , what happened to the wisps of gray hair that were appearing at his temples ? I reach over , gently rub his now very dark brown sideburns and giggle to myself . I ca n't really imagine Bill using Grecian Formula , but he 's done something . Maybe after all these years , my honey does have a secret or two . " So , darling , our first night , just us , " I say squeezing his strong arm even tighter . " What 's your pleasure ? The little Ethiopian restaurant in New Haven , or should we get home right away and I 'll slip into something comfortable ? " I lean over to kiss his cheek , but Bill has picked up his pace , and I just miss . " Hallie , I have something to tell you , " Bill says . He keeps walking , looking straight ahead . Uh-oh . Bad opening line . I stumble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to tell you " never comes before " I love you passionately , " or even , " I 've always liked your pot roast . " No , " I 've something to tell you " usually precedes bad news like , " The cat died , " or " The house just burned down . " Or in this case ? " I 'm leaving , " Bill says without breaking stride . He 's what ? I mull the words in my head for a moment . Surely if " leaving " meant leaving for good , my husband , my mate , my partner of two decades , the man who made love to me just three nights ago-or was it four ? - would have sat me down before breaking the news . My Bill , my sweet Bill , would even have bought me a cup of coffee first . Unless he 's no longer my sweet Bill . Leaving . Time stops and I stand frozen . For a moment , the whole world goes silent and the only sound I hear is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mournful call : You 'll be alone you 'll be alone you 'll be alone . But I ca n't even think about that possibility . Anyway , what does a bird know ? I pull my attention back and try to misunderstand Bill 's comment the best I can . " Fine , we 'll leave New Haven and go home for dinner , " I say . Then , prattling on , I add , " I can defrost some lasagna or whip up an omelet . I have some brie . You like a brie omelet , do n't you , honey ? " Bill finally stops walking and turns toward me . " What I mean is I 'm leaving you . " He pauses and looks at me with what I 'm sure he thinks is a kind smile . " We 've had a good run . A darn good twenty-one years together in a happy marriage . You 're a great gal , Hallie . I have no complaints . But it 's time for my second act . " What is he talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get away with that . This sounds like a speech he 's been practicing in front of the mirror for days . But the show 's not over . It ca n't be . He 's not leaving . I take a deep breath . I bet I even know what 's going on . Just like me , Bill 's upset about Emily 's going off to college and he does n't know how to react . In fact , he 's a guy . He does n't even know that he is reacting . It 's my job to reassure him . " Listen , honey , we 're going to be okay , " I say gently . " I love you . You love me . I got season tickets to the Knicks-just like you always wanted . We do n't need the kids at home to keep us together . " He does n't reply , so to fill in the space , I keep talking . " I 'm thinking of taking a pottery class . " Bill looks at me oddly for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , Hallie . I 'm glad you 've got plans . I 've made some plans , too . " We get to the car and I slide into my usual seat on the passenger 's side . I start to put in the CD of the St. Lawrence Quartet playing Hayden that 's always been one of Bill 's favorites , but he takes it out immediately and replaces Hayden with something loud and blaring . " What the heck is that ? " I ask . " Black Eyed Peas , " he says , proudly . " My new favorite . They 're very hot , way up on the charts . " I turn down the volume , but my head continues pounding . Who 's this rap-music-listening Grecian Formula-using man sitting next to me ? All these years , I thought I knew every detail about my husband but something changed while I was busy working , raising the kids , and buying him shirts at Brooks Brothers . I suddenly feel like a fool . What else have I missed ? The next hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the narrow Merritt Parkway toward the suburbs of New York . Given all the twisty turns , I do n't know how anybody survives on this road and , right now , I 'm not sure I want to . With the kids gone and Bill leaving , what 's left ? I stare out the window , seeing only my dismal future , and barely notice that we 've missed the exit for our small town , Chaddick , until we pass over the bridge into Manhattan . " Where are we going ? " I ask . Bill does n't answer , but his mouth is set and his brow is clenched so tightly that his two eyebrows join in a solid line . One thing I do still know about my husband-the caterpillar brow means something 's up . Moments later Bill pulls over in front of a brownstone on a residential block in the West Nineties and stops the car , double-parked . He leans over and gives me a nervous peck on the cheek , then hands me the car keys . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feigning nonchalance . And as if nothing has changed , he adds , " Drive carefully . It looked like there was a backup north on the Henry Hudson , so you might want to take Riverside Drive . " My mouth opens but nothing comes out . " You 're not coming home ? " I finally manage to sputter . " Where are we ? " " My new apartment , " Bill says , gesturing toward the limestone stoop . Anxious to make a getaway , he gets out of the car and retrieves a duffel bag I had n't noticed from the backseat . " You have an apartment ? " I ask , dumbfounded . " Actually , it 's not just mine " he says . He bolts up the steps to his new front door , and when he gets there , he turns and adds , " It 's Ashlee 's apartment . Ashlee , with two E 's . " Ashlee . Ashlee . Ashlee . Ashlee . Ashleeeee . Say it enough times while you 're lying under a fluffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And screaming is therapeutic . As is banging your head against the wall , gouging your betraying husband 's face out of every photo in the house , eating twelve superlarge packages of Oreos-the double stuff kind-in a record two days ( without any milk ) , and reading the entire stack of U.S. News &; World Report magazines that had been gathering dust in the basement . I might as well live in the past since I have no future . I go through every issue from 1989 to 1994 cover-to-cover and read in a 1990 copy that Vanilla Ice 's album is selling like crazy and that he 'll last forever . Hah ! Where 's Vanilla Ice now ? His career melted faster than sorbet in the summertime . Like me , he 's been replaced . I have n't watched daytime television since I was home on maternity leave with Emily , but now QVC is my constant companion . It 's been a comfort these last four days to know I can order an Italian domed Byzantine necklace or a marquise tanzanite pinwheel brooch any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered both-and more . The UPS guy has made so many deliveries he must figure I 'm a compulsively early Christmas shopper . On the other hand , he probably wonders why I have n't bothered to bring any of my bounty inside . Unfortunately that would require my actually getting out of bed and going down the stairs , and right now I 'm reserving all my energy for essentials-like replenishing my supply of Oreos . I made Bill promise that he would n't tell Adam and Emily what 's happened . I explained I did n't want to ruin the start of their school year , but the truth is I just do n't want to talk about it . I figure it 's like the tree falling in the forest . If a man leaves his wife and nobody knows , has he really left ? But I should have realized that my husband 's not that good at keeping promises . Adam has taken to calling twice a day from school and asking solicitously , " How are you , mom ? " From the grave tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has told him something even more tragic than our news-like maybe , on top of everything else , I have dengue fever . Whatever 's wrong with me , I 've called in sick to my office for the first time in my fifteen years as a lawyer for Rosen , O'Grady , and Riccardi-New York 's first and probably still only Jewish-Irish-Italian law firm . It 's also the only law firm that could hire me , a WASP , on the basis of affirmative action . We specialize in antidiscrimination cases and , given the company dinners of kugel , corned beef and cabbage , and cannoli , we often specialize in indigestion . Still , I like the firm and they like me . I 've always been able to keep my workweek down to four days , and the job comes with a good pension plan and a regular supply of Tums . It 's been years since I 've had a whole day to fill without work and kids , never mind this many days , but trying to do anything useful right now would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm even more furious at myself . How could he do this to me ? How could I let him do this to me ? You do n't just walk out on someone after two kids and twenty-one years and say Adios , have a good life . Who the hell does he think he is , leaving without even a single discussion ? For chrissakes , when we were renovating the kitchen , we spent six weeks talking about which color tile to pick . He wanted dark green and I wanted white and we settled on a sea foam with cream trim . That 's called compromise , Bill , and it 's what you do in marriage . The fucker . I do n't know if I want to get him back , or just get him . I sink back into the pillows , exhausted from playing the same rant over and over in my head . I need to do something else-anything . I stretch my hand in front of my face . A little bit of light is coming in through the closed blinds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . Look , it 's a bunny . The ringing phone jars me back to reality , the one place I do n't want to be . I 've barely spoken to anyone in a week , except for the kids and my best friend Bellini . But from the caller ID , I see it 's the firm 's senior partner , Arthur Rosen-a man who 's always been a fair boss . I roll over to answer it and cradle the receiver in the crook of my neck . Arthur makes small talk for a couple of minutes , then says , " I hate to bother you when you 're sick , Hallie , but I had a question on the Tyler case . " Since we 're going to talk business , I reluctantly reach under the blankets for the remote so I can turn down the volume on Victoria Principal 's pitch for her line of skin-care products . Though , as soon as I get off the call , I 'm going to order some of her Prime Secret Reclaim EyeMazing Refirming Eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to see how they fit all those words on a tiny two-ounce tube . Focus . Focus . Focus . I listen to what Arthur has to say about the case . Our client Charles Tyler is being sued for sexual harassment-with an unusual twist . The defendant claims Mr. Tyler passed her over for a promotion and gave it to another woman in the office-who he was sleeping with . In other words , she 's suing him for screwing someone else . I try to make an intelligent comment or two , but mostly I try not to burst into uncontrollable sobs and spill every detail of my now-horrible life to Arthur . But he clearly picks up that something 's wrong . " So Hallie , " he says hesitantly , " I do n't mean to pry , but you 've been out for almost a week . Should I be worried about you ?
