Headnote The Christian right is reeling from its biggest electoral defeat in a quarter century - and now they 're talking about abandoning the GOP // FOR THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT , last year was nothing short of satanic . First , the president of the National Association of Evangelicals , Ted Haggard , was forced to quit amid allegations that he enjoyed drugs and sex with a male prostitute . Then Democrats racked up a landslide victory , regaining control of both houses of Congress and ousting some of the religious right 's staunchest allies , including Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania , Rep. Jim Ryun of Kansas and Rep. John Hostettler of Indiana . Even worse , Americans rejected a host of measures near and dear to the hearts of evangelicals . In South Dakota , voters overturned a ban on abortion . In California , they voted against a measure requiring parental notification when teens have abortions . In Arizona , they rejected an amendment outlawing same-sex marriages , and in Missouri , they voted in favor of stem-cell research over the militant opposition of evangelicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right has been building ever since the state tried to impose the teaching of anti-evolution " intelligent design , " voters ousted Attorney General Phill Kline , who had made a career out of hassling and intimidating abortion clinics . " The 2006 election was a total repudiation of the Karl Rove version of conservatism , " says Curtis Gans , director of the nonpartisan Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University . " The social-rightist version of the Republican Party was defeated everywhere but where the social rightists thrive : the Bible Belt . " Unless the GOP can reinvent itself and appeal to moderate and independent voters , warns Gans , it " may be consigned to where they had been from 1932 until the late 1960s - a distinctly minority party . " The sweeping defeat has left many evangelicals feeling angry , depressed and shellshocked . For the first time since they seized control of the Republican Party more than a quarter century ago , some on the Christian right are talking privately about breaking away from the GOP . " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - but a third party can be a spoiler , " says a top official at a leading Christian-right organization . " I do n't know what 's going to happen , but anything 's possible . " Other evangelicals favor sitting out next year 's presidential campaign - or even dropping out of politics altogether . David Kuo , a longtime activist on the Christian right who served as President Bush 's deputy director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives , suggested that evangelicals take stock and consider the " negative spiritual consequences of political obsession . " And a recent survey on Beliefnet.com , a nonpartisan forum on religion and spirituality , found that four out often evangelical voters now favor the idea of Christians taking a two-year " fast " from politics . But according to evangelical leaders and activists , most in the movement are determined to mount a massive counterattack in 2008 - beginning with a no-holdsbarred effort to reconquer the Republican Party and reignite the " culture wars " over abortion , gay marriage and stem-cell research . Rather than examining its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right blames moderate Republicans for mounting a centrist campaign that failed to stir up voters on hot-button issues . As evangelicals see it , the party took them for granted in 2006 , refusing to champion a " pro-family " agenda at the polls . " They court us in the primaries - and once they get elected , they tell us to take our place in the back of the bus , " says Tim Wildmon , president of the American Family Association , one of the most powerful groups on the Christian right . " But we 're not going away . They need us more than we need them . If they cut off the evangelical arm of the party , they 'll be a minority party for years and years . If they try to divorce themselves from values voters and groups like ours , they 'll suffer the consequences . " Like Samson pulling down the temple on himself as well as the Philistines , social conservatives are n't afraid of bringing down the whole Republican Party . Back in 1996 , when moderate conservative Sen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters did n't bother to vote , and Dole was handily defeated . Unless the GOP heeds the Christian right , Wildmon warns , millions of evangelical voters may once again refuse to go to the polls next year . " It 's true we have nowhere else to go , except to stay home , " he says . But the message to Republicans , he adds , is clear : " We would rather go down on our principles . We lose ? You lose ! " TO ENSURE THAT REPUBLICANS GET the message in 2008 , the religious right is redoubling its efforts to mobilize its political machine - including tens of thousands of churches , hundreds of radio stations and two national television net ' works . The Family Research Council , a leading lobby for the Christian right , is planning a huge expansion on the Internet , including videos and podcasts , to reach millions in next year 's election . " We want to be sure that the lessons of the last election have been learned , and that the Republicans understand that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charmaine Yoest , the council 's vice president of communications . " When you 're looking at razor-thin margins , you better pay attention to your base . " The group fired an early shot across the OOP 's bow in January , when it delivered a videotaped response to President Bush 's State of the Union speech . " The president failed to draw a line in the sand on behalf of life , " charged Tony Perkins , head of the Family Research Council . " What will become of the culture of life , of the defense of marriage ? " The council displayed a chart on which it noted the number of times the president mentioned the Christian right 's core issues : marriage , o ; abortion , o ; stem cells , o ; cloning , o ; abstinence , o ; and values , o . But it wo n't be easy for evangelicals to force Republicans to cater to " values voters . " The biggest obstacle they face is striking : Unlike the born-again George W. Bush , who paraded his Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the leading candidates for the GOP nomination in 2008 are distinctly unsympathetic to evangelicals and their agenda . Sen. John McCain of Arizona earned the enmity of the religious right in 2000 , when he denounced evangelical leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwcll as " agents of intolerance . " Despite his recent efforts to mend fences with evangelicals , McCain has had little or no success . " I pray that we will not get stuck with him , " James Dobson of the Christian-right powerhouse Focus on the Family told reporters . " Speaking as a private individual , I would not vote for John McCain under any circumstances . " Rudy Giuliani is equally anathema to evangelicals , not only because he is prochoice and supports gay rights but also because he flaunted his less-than-puritanical lifestyle with his mistress while he was mayor of New York . " He is unacceptable . " says Perkins of the Family Research Council . And Mitt Romney , the former governor of Massachusetts , is still viewed with suspicion by many Bible-believing Christians because he has supported gay rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate to back , evangelicals face an unpalatable choice : Either hold their nose and rally behind Romney , or throw their support behind a longshot contender who does n't have a prayer of winning , such as Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas or former Gov . Mike Huckabee Arkansas . " We 're going to work hard in the primaries to support the candidate of our choice , " says Phil Burress , president of Citizens for Community Values . " But if it comes down to McCain and Romney , I 'm in Romney 's camp . " Beyond the field of candidates , however , the Christian right faces an even more formidable problem : The Republican Party itself is beginning to rethink its longtime union with evangelical voters . The alliance has always been an uneasy marriage of convenience , wedding business-oriented , taxcutting centrists to an ideological , militantly evangelical base . Now , emboldened by the defeat of " pro-family " issues and candidates in November , moderates in the party are trying to loosen what they see as the Christian right 's stranglehold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , when former Sen. Jack Dantorth of Missouri , a mainline Episcopal priest and the author of Faith and Politics , ignited a firestorm among the religious right by writing an Op-Ed in Tite New York Times that slammed Republicans for having " transformed our party into the political arm of conservative Christians . " Then last fall , former House Majority Leader Dick Armey stunned evangelicals by calling their de facto leader , James Dobson of Focus on the Family , a " bully . " Rep. Christopher Shays , a liberal Republican , was even harsher : " This Republican Party of Lincoln , " he warned , " has become a party of theocracy . " The revolt of the moderates was especially evident in Kansas last year , when a host of GOP politicians left the party to run as Democrats . " It 's increasingly clear that most voters do n't share the priorities of the evangelical right , " says Peter Montgomery , who follows religious voting trends for People for the American Way . " That 's why you see so many Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIGHT ALSO FACES A stiff challenge from Democrats , who successfully reached out to evangelical voters last November . In some cases they did so by fielding candidates with pro-life credentials , including newly elected Sen. Bob Cascy of Pennsylvania and Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina . In other cases they did so by simply recasting the party 's rhetoric and reaching out to church groups . " They were smart , " says Genevieve Wood , director of strategic operations at the Heritage Foundation and a former staffer at the Family Research Council . " They made a deliberate attempt to go after those folks . " Case in point : Ohio . In 2004 , Ohio provided the critical margin to re-elect Bush , as evangelical voters flocked to the polls to support a ballot measure banning gay marriage . But in 2006 , the political landscape shifted dramatically . In the governor 's race , the Democrats nominated Ted Strickland , a former Methodist minister who spoke movingly about his religious beliefs , met with voters at churches , placed ads on Christian radio stations and retrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protecting the environment - as " Christian values . " In the end , Strickland won the race with nearly half of the white evangelical vote - almost as much as his Republican opponent , Ken Blackwell , a conservative evangelical . It was a stunning result . " We split the white evangelical vote and won outright among mainstream Protestants and Catholics , " says Mara Vanderslicc , a political consultant who helped the Democrats target Christian voters in Ohio and other key battleground states last year . As a result , Republicans lost ground among their traditional religious base . In 2004 , the GOP won seventy-eight percent of the white evangelical vote nationwide . In 2006 , the party 's share dipped to seventy percent - a significant swing in hotly contested races . " It 's not like you have to win " em , " says James Carville , the Democratic strategist who engineered Bill Clinton 's rise to power . " You just have to do better . Even if you go up five points , it 's a big deal . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Man , a couple of points difference that 's what the political consultants get paid the big bucks to deliver , " says Yoest of the Family Research Council . " In a divided electorate , that 's significant . " Despite GOP losses among evangelical voters , most observers agree that the religious right remains the bedrock of the Republican coalition . According to John Green , a senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , the GOP must win back evangelical voters in Iowa , Missouri , Illinois , Indiana and Ohio if it hopes to retake Congress . " It 's hard to imagine the Republican Party making a comeback in the Midwest without evangelical voters , " says Green . That 's a view evangelical leaders are quick to echo . " The Republicans ca n't win without their base , " insists Andrea Lafferty , execxitive director ot the Traditional Values Coalition , which includes 43,000 churches . " And Christian voters are their base . " Democrats are also careful not to underestimate the continuing strength of the religious right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of social conservatism . The Christian right has been repeatedly proclaimed dead over the past twenty-five years , particularly after the election of Bill Clinton in 1992 - only to rise stronger than ever . " The reports of their demise have been greatly exaggerated , " says CarviHe , noting that the religious right 's media empire and network of churches provide the Republican Party with a permanent national infrastructure . " If anybody thinks that they 're not going to exert influence in the Republican nominating process in 2008 , they 're nuts .

Only two GOP candidates - Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas and former Gov . Mike Huckabee of Arkansas - boast sterling credentials with the religious right . But to call them long shots would be an understatement : In the latest poll , Brownback came in at one percent , and Huckabee did n't even register . That leaves the three GOP front-runners - all of whom are now genuflecting at the Christian right 's altar . R.D. JOHN McCAIN COURTING FALWELL Long reviled by evangelicals , McCain is working to bolster his standing with the Christian right . His campaign staff now includes David Rexrode. who handled evangelical outreach for the Republican National Committee last year , along with an ex-Christian Coalition executive and a former aide to the Rev.

" agreed to host a party for the senator in February at the annual National Religious Broadcasters convention in Orlando . Florida . MITT ROMNEY THE ABOUT-FACE Many evangelicals consider Mormonism to be a weird . non-Christian sect , and they do n't like Romney 's past as a gay-rights champion . So the former Massachusetts governor , who will need the Christian right 's support to defeat his GOP contenders , has done an about-face on abortion and is backpedaling furiously on gay rights . Last October . Romney invited religious-right power brokers - including Falwell. the Rev. Franklin Graham ( Billy 's son ) and Gary Bauer to his Boston home . He has signed up Gary Marx , who ran President Bush 's religiousright outreach in 2O04 . He organized a bash for radio and TV preachers in Orlando this February , and he has agreed to give the commencement speech at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given his support for abortion and gay rights , not to mention his two divorces , it would take a miracle for Giuliani to appeal to the party 's fire-breathing base . But in recent weeks , he has taken the first steps to court the religious right - by shifting his stance on abortion . Giuliani wooed voters in South Carolina , assuring them that he would appoint " strict constructionist " judges to the Supreme Court - code among conservatives seeking to overturn Roe v. Wade . He also announced his support for banning late-term abortions and requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortions . So far , evangelicals remain unimpressed . " He ca n't win . " said Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention . " Most evangelicals I know wo n't vote for him even if he runs against Hillary Clinton .
