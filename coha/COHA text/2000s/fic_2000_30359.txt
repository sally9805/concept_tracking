From Chapter One : My Mother , My Father and Peoria My first conscious memory , I must have been three or so , I looked at myself in the mirror in my mother 's bedroom , and I said , " How tall I am ! " I looked in the mirror and saw a tall girl . But , of course , I was n't tall really . I was , I am , quite short . What made me see myself as tall back then in Peoria in my mother 's room ? Every night , before we went to bed , we had to say our prayers . The Shema Yisrael , then " Now I lay me down to sleep , " then " God bless Mother and Daddy , and Amy and Harry , and Rex , our dog , " who used to escort me to school every day and got killed crossing Main Street on the way home . And after " God bless " we could make a personal prayer , a wish to God . And I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best " ( that must have been when I was in fourth grade , maybe ten or so , when kissing games , post office behind the couch , and " Bobby likes Marian " teasing began ; of course , I learned later , it was Daddy I really wanted to like me best ) . My second prayer was : " When I grow up , I want a work to do , " because I knew , I knew , that was what was wrong with my mother , why she made our life so miserable , my father , us kids , me especially , and why , inside , she was so miserable herself . She did n't have any work of her own to do . ( And how I knew that , then , I do n't know . Because women like my mother , then , did n't have jobs or careers . Nobody even asked women then , " What do you do ? " Nobody asked little girls then , " What do you want to be when you grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Except when she was discontented , or angry at one of us , which was most of thetime . Though , when she was n't , she could be a lot of fun . ) She loved shopping . Everything she did , she did perfectly  --  perfect grooming , her clothes perfectly tailored , meals cooked and served to perfection under her orders . I remember how she would tinkle the dinner bell , then , later , press the electric buzzer under the table for the maid . But she did n't do anything herself . On Thursday night when the maid was off , she insisted that we learn to cook . But she was so impatient that when it was my turn , I cut the potatoes wrong , or burned the butter . She swam , played bridge , mahjong , tennis , golf , though it was a constant sore that she could n't play at the Peoria Country Club , which , of course , did n't take Jews . She was a superb driver , she always drove on our trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I remember my father driving us as a Sunday treat in our new Peerless , our first car . But I remember how nervous we were when he drove us to the hospital when my little brother was born . To this day I myself am a nervous , reluctant driver . Our house was beautifully decorated , or so it seemed to me then , compared to my friends ' houses in Peoria , the silver and china and the Louis whatever furniture . My mother 's dresses and suits were tailored by her dressmaker to fit with elegant precision , and she even looked good in hats . ( I refused to wear hats until last summer when , after my heart valve surgery , a young friend brought me one to hide unwashed hair . ) But she never had anything that she thought was important to do . One year she would run the Sunday School , another year the women 's division of the Community Chest . At one point she took up something called eurhythmics , and I have a hazy memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ? My mother was born in Peoria in 1898 , Dr. Sandor Horwitz 's daughter . My grandfather had been studying to be a rabbi when he left Hungary to escape the pogroms , somehow got to St. Louis , went to grade school , high school and college in one year ( an apocryphal story ) , graduated in the first class of Washington University Medical School , was a lieutenant colonel in the army medical corps in World War I , and then came to Peoria and became Health Commissioner in charge of public health in all the outlying farm towns . Mother went to grade school and high school in Peoria , as I did , and then two years to the local college , Bradley . Ever since I can remember , she put it in my mind that I had to go away to college  --  in fact , to Smith , the best , largest women 's college ( women could n't go to Harvard or Yale then ) where the brightest of the girls at the Peoria Country Club seemed to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peoria newspaper ( the Journal , or the Star ; it 's now the Journal-Star ) . She loved the job and became the women 's page editor . She could not wait for me to get into junior high to put it into my mind to try for the school newspaper . But , of course , she had to quit her job when she married my father . Wives of businessmen did not work in towns like Peoria then , not even in the Depression , which clouded my childhood . My mother , growing up in Peoria , did not enjoy being Jewish . But she married my father , Harry Goldstein , when she was not yet twenty , an older Jewish businessman with no formal American education and a heavy Jewish accent . My father 's first wife had died years before , and he had been a bachelor for many years . I was born in 1921 , a year and a half later . He was forty when I was born , and that was old then . My father had also come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Europe , the oldest of thirteen children . He started out with a street corner stand selling collar buttons , did well enough to send his youngest brother to Harvard Law School , built up a fancy jewelry store , a kind of midwestern Tiffany 's , on South Adams Street , two blocks off Main , in downtown Peoria . The farmers and the farm machinery workers at Caterpillar and Keystone bought their wedding rings and china and silver and watches there . However , when depression hit the farm machinery business and the distilleries , people in Peoria did n't buy jewelry and fine china . My first vivid memory of my mother and father is fighting over money . My mother got an allowance from my father , and when she would overspend it or charged the limit on her charge accounts at the local department stores , she would try to recoup at one of the gambling houses in the outskirts of Peoria . Or , even more daring then , play the stock market . And she would lose more money , the huge bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream . ( Maybe I get my hot temper from him . ) I would put my head under the pillow , not to hear them fighting over money in the middle of the night . My sister , Amy , and I shared a room . She was eighteen months younger than me and to be honest , I do n't have too many childhood memories of her . My brother , Harry Junior , was born in 1926 , five years after me . My parents had wanted a boy , of course , and finally they had one . Harry was darling , but I remember being quite cruel to him and to my sister . I was the oldest and probably did n't want to share the attention , but that 's now , looking back on it . My mother , to all of us , was the most important person in the house . If she was in a good mood , everything was fine . If she was in a bad mood , which , unaccountably , she was most often , we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep out of her way . Everything she did , she did perfectly , and nothing we did was ever good enough . Once my father gave her a watch set in sapphires for Christmas . She pouted and raved because it was n't a diamond and ruby watch . I felt so bad for my father . I thought he was handsome , I 've seen pictures of him as a young man and he was handsome then . By the time I was born , he was a little stout and stooped , and his hair was getting gray . It surprised me , and I got quite angry , when one of our maids said he was n't handsome at all . I knew my mother was ashamed of his accent and his big nose , and that made me feel very bad . ( And , I suppose , I also felt ashamed , and did n't want to , back then in Peoria . ) My father used to tell me about the tenement in which he lived in St. Louis near Edna Ferber , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I started writing in school , he would save the papers I brought home and put them in his safe . If I wrote a poem , it was surely a masterpiece . Every morning , before he went to work , my father would take me and my sister for a little walk in Bradley Park , across Farmington Road , the street we lived on , with salt to put on a robin 's tail . I ca n't remember what that salt was supposed to do , or if we ever got close enough to a robin to do that . Daddy would come home for dinner every night , except when he had to work late , and he sat at the foot of the table and my mother at the head , where she could press the buzzer with her foot for the maid to come in and clear the table . Before the Depression , we had a cook , sometimes a second maid , and a chauffeur , though I doubt my father then made more than $15,000 a year . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that day , and my father would give us little lectures on important developments , like Lindy crossing the Atlantic . But , especially as the Depression worsened , my parents would get into arguments . Or I would say something , or do something , that got my mother mad , or , even worse , my father . And he would shout at me and I would cry . And he would shout even worse . He could n't stand women crying , he would say . I would get sent upstairs to my room . But it was Mother who ran our lives . As the Depression worsened , she created a kind of conspiracy with us , to keep it a secret from Daddy that she had bought something , a dress for one of us or for herself , something for the house . And I was part of that conspiracy , which made Daddy the enemy , and part of me felt bad about that , sad for him . Mostly my mother made me feel bad about myself . Nothing I did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take swimming lessons , tennis , golf , piano lessons , dancing school . I was n't good at any of it . I was a mess . School was something else . At school I came alive . I learned to read very quickly . I think I learned early so that I could escape my miserable mother , and the uncertain anger of my father . I would go to the library and take out six books at a time ( the maximum ) until one day my father saw me walking up Main Street hill carrying those books . It was n't ladylike , he scolded me , I must take out only three books at a time . For some reason I liked to read lying on my stomach on our living-room floor . The rest of the family would walk over me . If I was bad , my parents discovered that a spanking did n't have much effect on me . The only punishment that worked was forbidding me to read for a day . But when they shouted at me , or when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she so often did , or when they shouted at each other , I felt bad inside . A quite unbearable feeling , sometimes . During my second year in high school , or was it my third , I made a vow my parents would never make me cry again . And the next time they shouted , I went numb . A wall went up around me , and I did n't cry again . For many years , I could n't cry .
