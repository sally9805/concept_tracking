<p> The expression on Julia Roberts ' face is one of both outrage and gritty determination . " She brought a small town to its feet , " the ads say , " and a huge company to its knees . " <p> That huge company is San Francisco 's Pacific Gas and Electric Co. , which finds itself in the uncomfortable position of being cast as the object of Roberts ' scorn in the based-on-a-true-story new film " Erin Brockovich . " <p> The movie , opening nationwide tomorrow , has caused considerable consternation among PG &E's; top brass , and , according to one source , even prompted the utility to plant spies on the set to keep track of the production . <p> PG &E,; insiders say , is deeply concerned about the movie 's rehashing of one of the most notorious episodes in the company 's history . That case resulted in the utility paying $333 million to settle charges that it poisoned hundreds of people with a highly toxic chemical . <p> This is the last thing the company wants the public reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make the earlier settlement seem puny by comparison . More than 1,500 plaintiffs are participating in the latest case , which their lawyer says will show conclusively that the utility has repeatedly covered up environmental mishaps . <p> " Connecting the dots  --  that 's the thing PG &E; is most concerned about , " said a former high-ranking company official who requested anonymity . " They 've got environmental situations all over the place . <p> " If things come out , " the former official said , " a reputation they 've cultivated for environmental responsibility turns out to be not very responsible . " <p> " Erin Brockovich , " starring the highest-paid actress on the planet , centers on a 1993 lawsuit over contamination of the air and water around the small San Bernardino County town of Hinkley . <p> Local residents contended that as a result of exposure to the chemical chromium from PG &E's; nearby natural-gas pumping plant , they were subject to nearly every physical ailment imaginable , including various forms of cancer . <p> FILM PORTRAYS JUSTICE-SEEKERS <p> They are depicted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning the truth about their predicament from legal investigator Brockovich , only want justice for the tragedies they have experienced . <p> PG &E,; for its part , comes off as arrogant , cunning and duplicitous  --  the epitome of corporate evil . The company is depicted as attempting to deceive Hinkley residents and to cover up its misbehavior . It 's shown to be unsympathetic , at best , toward the more than 600 people it has hurt . <p> In real life , the company admitted that it released chromium into the environment from 1951 to 1966 . However , it did not inform local residents of that until 1987 . <p> PG &E; ultimately decided not to contest the resulting lawsuit and to instead enter into binding arbitration . The case was settled in July 1996 . <p> PG &E; MEMO ADMITS ERROR <p> An internal memo sent to PG &E; employees last week from Bob Glynn , chief executive of the utility 's parent company , admitted that " PG &E; did not respond to the groundwater problem as openly , quickly or thoroughly as it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that our company should have handled some things differently at that time , " the memo says . <p> Still , it notes that " based on a true story ' does n't mean that everything in the story is true . The movie is an entertainment vehicle . " <p> Be that as it may , PG &E; was quick to realize that " Erin Brockovich " could explode into a PR nightmare . <p> STAR POWER FRIGHTENS OFFICIALS <p> " It was bad enough that a film was being made , " the former company official said . " But the fact that Julia Roberts was in it really heightened anxiety . Everybody figured that Hollywood would slam the hell out of the company . " <p> Another source , a PG &E; employee who worked for the utility during the Hinkley lawsuit and is still with the company , confirmed that PG &E; executives were indeed concerned about the depiction of the utility in the movie . <p> " Sure there was concern , " this employee said . " We did n't know how the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stand-up company , or would it look like a sleaze ? " <p> NAME CHANGE NOT PURSUED <p> The former official , who also was with PG &E; throughout the Hinkley matter and during the subsequent making of " Erin Brockovich , " said the company at one point considered paying the film 's producers to change PG &E's; name in the movie . <p> " They never called us , " said Carla Santos Shamberg , executive producer of " Erin Brockovich . " " And that 's just as well . It would have made them look even worse to try and bribe us . " <p> She also defended the overwhelmingly good-versus-evil tone of the movie . <p> " I ca n't come up with what PG &E; did right in this circumstance , " Shamberg said . " These people were victims of PG &E's; misdeeds . We portrayed ( events ) as accurately as we could . " <p> To keep tabs on the film 's production , PG &E; hired a Southern California public relations company to monitor media reports and to send back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> WORRIED ABOUT TIMING <p> " There was a lot of interest in finding out when the film would open , " this person said . " Would it come out just before the annual meeting ? " <p> PG &E; spokesman Greg Pruett denied that the company hired anyone to spy on the filmmakers . He also echoed Glynn 's position that the movie " is a dramatization , not a documentary , and there can be quite a bit of latitude in how you combine facts and drama . " <p> Both Pruett and Glynn said they had n't yet seen " Erin Brockovich . " That they nevertheless have strong stands on the film 's accuracy indicates how seriously PG &E; executives take tomorrow 's opening . <p> BRACED THEN , BRACED NOW <p> The publicity should be a good deal more fierce this time around than when the case was originally settled . Although PG &E; was braced at the time for a firestorm of lousy PR , the former official said the company was pleasantly surprised to find the matter all but ignored by the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this did not become a big story , " this person said . <p> Leading up to the settlement , the former official said , " we were extremely concerned that someone in the media would pick up on how the arbitration happened down there . It was a daily concern . " <p> Similarly , the former official said company executives were worried that some enterprising reporter would piece together that chromium had been used to prevent corrosion in pumps not only at the Hinkley plant , but at facilities in Kettleman near Fresno and in the town of Topock on the California-Arizona border . <p> OTHER CLAIMS PENDING <p> The real-life Brockovich investigated the Kettleman plant , and the real-life lawyer she works for , Ed Masry , has filed another suit against PG &E; on behalf of about 1,400 former residents of the area and PG &E; workers seeking compensation for personal injuries , as well as more than 150 Hinkley residents who missed out on the first settlement . <p> " PG &E; is going to get burned bad , " Masry said . " Kettleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing all the same things . " <p> PG &E's; Pruett said he could not comment on the Kettleman case or any other pending lawsuit . <p> Meanwhile , the former PG &E; official said potential contamination from use of chromium at the Topock plant " could be the worst of all . It 's right next to the Colorado River . " <p> REPORT DUE SOON <p> Ron Baker , a spokesman for the state Department of Toxic Substances Control in Sacramento , said investigators have indeed found evidence of chromium contamination in the soil and groundwater surrounding the Topock plant . <p> " However , the river has not been affected yet , " he said . <p> A full report on the department 's findings will be released next month . <p> The former PG &E; official said the company 's strategy has been to isolate Hinkley " as a one-time situation " and to not draw attention to use of chromium at other plants . <p> At the same time , this person added , " the company has been doing a lot to bill itself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a distinct threat , obviously , to that image . " <p> PG &E's; " statement of environmental policy " says the company " is committed to being an environmental leader " and will " comply fully with the letter and spirit of applicable environmental laws and regulations . " <p> But the utility is no stranger to accusations of environmental wrongdoing . In 1993 , for example , more than 250 current and former residents of the Midway Village public housing complex in Daly City sued PG &E; for allegedly contaminating soil in the area with toxic chemicals . <p> INCIDENCE OF DEFECTS HIGH <p> PG &E; has challenged claims that chemicals from its nearby facility are responsible for the illnesses of Midway residents , although a federal health study last year found that the residents suffer from an " abnormal " number of genetic defects . <p> In 1997 , the company agreed to pay $14 million to dismiss state and federal claims that it withheld information about the impact of the cooling system at its Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant on marine life . <p> Masry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its environmental problems will go away if the company simply persists in trying to keep them under wraps . <p> " Their heads are in the sand , " he said . " And now they think this movie is just going to go away . But instead it looks like it could be a big hit . " <p> As if that was n't bad enough for the utility , Masry said CourtTV has already asked to air the proceedings of the Kettleman trial live on cable . <p> " It 's going to get a lot worse for PG &E,"; he predicted . <p> E-mail David Lazarus at davidlaz@sfgate.com.
