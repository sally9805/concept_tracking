America 's leading arts organization is recommitting itself to its bold founding vision  --  and lifting the curtain on its $1.2 billion renovation . In the lobby of a reimagined Alice Tully Hall , a few of the many players behind Lincoln Center today . From left : ZARIN MEHTA President and executive director , the New York Philharmonic MARA MANUS Executive director , the Film Society of Lincoln Center GEORGE STEEL Artistic director and general manager , New York City Opera JOSEPH POLISI President , the Juilliard School KATHERINE FARLEY Chairman , Lincoln Center Development Project DAVID RUBENSTEIN Cochairman , Bravo Lincoln Center Campaign REYNOLD LEVY President , Lincoln Center IT WAS ROBERT MOSES , NEW YORK CITY 'S MASTER BUILDER , WHO CONCEIVED THE FIRST GLIMMERINGS OF THE IDEA . IT WAS A GROUP OF WEALTHY CULTURATI KNOWN AS THE DUKES OF NEW YORK WHO HAMMERED it out over lunch meetings at a private club in Midtown . And it was a president of the United States , Dwight D. Eisenhower , who broke ground for it in May 1959 . That " it " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would bring seven world-class institutions  --  the New York Philharmonic , the Metropolitan Opera , New York City Ballet , the Juilliard School , a new repertory-theater company , an operetta theater and a performing-arts library  --  together on one purpose-built , sixteen-acre urban campus . Nothing like it existed anywhere in the world . Many cities , including New York , had great opera houses , symphonic spaces and theaters , but nowhere were the premier performing institutions clustered in one place , in buildings constructed at the same time , designed by some of the era 's foremost architects . The whole idea was grandiose , risky , unprecedented  --  in a word , American . As the New York Times declared of the groundbreaking , this new enterprise put the world on notice that " Americans know how to build the life of the spirit on its material bounty . " And the patchwork of public , private and institutional funding that would be put together to pay its $185 million construction cost , as well as the ongoing maintenance and administrative costs of the campus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where court or government patronage has always footed the bill for the arts . In the fifty years since its founding , Lincoln Center has had more than its share of Great Cultural Moments : the glittering opening of Philharmonic Hall in 1962 , attended by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy , at which Leonard Bernstein conducted the premiere of Aaron Copland 's Connotations for Orchestra ; New York City Ballet 's legendary 1972 Stravinsky Festival , in which thirty-one ballets , twenty-one of them premieres , were presented in a single week ; Beverly Sills 's long-awaited 1975 Metropolitan Opera debut in Rossini 's Le Sige de Corinthe , which was greeted with an eighteen-minute ovation ; the 1994 premiere of Wynton Marsalis 's Pulitzer prize-winning jazz composition Blood on the Fields ; Lincoln Center Theater 's Tony Award-winning production of Tom Stoppard 's epic historical trilogy , The Coast of Utopia , in 2007 ; and many more . It has nurtured the careers of such artists as conductor James Levine , dancer Suzanne Farrell , playwright John Guare and others . It has hosted operas and ballets and plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing . It has been praised , vilified , argued over and written off as irrelevant ( sometimes all in the same paragraph ) by pundits and audiences alike . But as the song says , it 's still here . More than that , it has become the model for dozens of similar complexes , such as Washington 's Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts , Denver 's Center for the Performing Arts and the Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County , whose aims have been to promote culture while revitalizing the cities around them . And today it 's in the midst of a massive $1.2 billion redevelopment effort that has turned its campus into a construction site . When all the plywood fences come off , in 2011 , the world will see a new Lincoln Center  --  one that will be , as its current president , Reynold Levy , says , even " more welcoming , more inviting and very much focused on the next generation of artists and audiences . " From the first , the qualities that distinguished Lincoln Center  --  its concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its creative financing  --  inspired not only excitement but skepticism , controversy and , fittingly for a nexus of the performing arts , drama . Erected on a tract of land whose crumbling tenements played backdrop to the filmed version of the musical West Side Story , the " travertine Acropolis " ( as the AIA Guide to New York City described it ) was slammed by urban planners and citizens ' advocates as an elitist enclave that had displaced 7,000 low-income families and literally turned its windowless stone back on its neighborhood . Others seemed to feel that Lincoln Center was n't elite enough : the architect Hugh Hardy dismisses its concept as " suburban . " And its individual buildings , designed by such midcentury titans as Eero Saarinen , Philip Johnson , Gordon Bunshaft , Pietro Belluschi and Wallace K. Harrison , were greeted with raspberries , not raves : the architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable wrote them all off collectively as " a failure of nerve , imagination and talent . " Certainly , each structure seemed to come with its own set of problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be completely gutted three times to address deficiencies in the auditorium 's acoustics . The Vivian Beaumont Theater , with its cutting-edge thrust stage , designed by Jo Mielziner and Saarinen , was declared unfit for performing and closed for four years ; even the New York State Theater ( now the David H. Koch Theater ) , tailor-made by Johnson for New York City Ballet , had to have its proscenium altered and acoustics adjusted to suit its other tenant , New York City Opera . And as City Ballet 's current director , Peter Martins , tells it , some rehearsal areas were still cramped : " Mr. B. George Balanchine , NYCB 's cofounder said , ' You know , dear , whose fault that is ? Philippe . More important for Philippe to have big public promenade than ballet studio . ' " Nor were the challenges confined to Lincoln Center 's physical plant . " The concept of putting these world-class institutions all in the same place was laughed at throughout the performing-arts community , " says Nathan Leventhal , a former deputy mayor and president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' You guys must be nuts . You 're going to be competing not only for audiences but for philanthropic support . ' " SIBLING RIVALRIES Perhaps it was unrealistic to expect that a group of strong-willed and independent artists and administrators  --  such as the Met 's autocratic general director , Rudolph Bing , the Philharmonic 's emotionally impulsive music director , Leonard Bernstein , and New York City Ballet 's clinically bipolar cofounder and general manager , Lincoln Kirstein  --  would play together nicely , like well-behaved kindergartners . Apparently , they could n't . By the middle of the 1960s , Variety was reporting a " three-front war " among Lincoln Center 's constituents over which of them had the most power , who had the ear of which donors and whether Lincoln Center Inc . ( " LincInc " ) was merely a landlord or the head of an artistic confederation . Not surprisingly , since its board was the most star-studded and powerful and its budget the largest , the Met had the lead in many of these dramas . When Lincoln Center admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bing was furious at the inclusion of an organization he said had " no place " in a consortium that " aimed at the highest cultural achievements . " The Philharmonic , and to a lesser extent the Met and the Juilliard School , resisted the 1967 organizing of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center , which would occupy a theater in the new Juilliard building , because they felt it would compete with their own offerings . Nor was Lincoln Center 's idealistic but increasingly beleaguered president , William Schuman , always adroit in handling the problems . When he explored hiring a seasoned Met administrator to cure the chronic financial hemorrhaging at the repertory theater , the territorial Bing was outraged , and the theater 's management , producer Robert Whitehead and director Elia Kazan , quit in protest . And when Schuman initiated a summer festival in 1967 , all the constituents raised a ruckus because they feared it would rob them of donors . It did n't , but the strain it put on LincInc 's budget and on Schuman 's relationship with his board  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 . Despite such territorial and budgetary squabbles , however , things did n't fall apart , and somehow the Center held . Committed management by its successive administrators , who evolved creative formulas for funding and operations , and steadfast support from a number of generous patrons were important factors ( see " Great Givers , 1959-2009 , " page 94 ) . But the key to Lincoln Center 's survival seems to have been a law of physics . As Lincoln Center grew  --  adding the Chamber Music Society ( as a full member , in 1973 ) , the Film Society ( 1974 ) , the School of American Ballet ( 1987 ) and Jazz at Lincoln Center ( 1996 ) ; a clutch of new programs , including Mostly Mozart , American Songbook and Great Performers ; and two new venues , a tower on 65th Street called the Rose Building and a three-theater complex in the Time Warner Center , at Columbus Circle , for Jazz at Lincoln Center  --  the whole became more than the sum of its parts , and magnetic force held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always a sense of competition , but it diminishes as it becomes clear that the more activity there is on the Lincoln Center campus , the better it is for everyone . " What he does n't say , although it seems self-evident , is that there 's really nowhere else the constituents could go and have the same institutional critical mass . As time went on , too , Lincoln Center broadened its appeal . Leventhal says , " We 'd done some studies that showed our audiences were old and getting older , and rich and getting richer , and while I have nothing against old and rich people , it seemed we needed to have more diversity in our audiences and in our art forms . " Serious Fun ! , which would morph into the Lincoln Center Festival , was one effort in that direction , presenting such diverse offerings as Robert Wilson 's Overture to the Fourth Act of Deafman Glance and the Blue Man Group . In 1989 , Midsummer Night Swing , a series of alfresco big-band dances on Lincoln Center Plaza ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new public onto the campus . And the consortium 's outreach became national with the creation of Live From Lincoln Center , an extraordinary series of PBS broadcasts masterminded by John Goberman , a former cellist with New York City Ballet , the Metropolitan Opera orchestra and the New York Philharmonic , which transmitted performances exactly as they appeared in Lincoln Center 's halls to an audience of millions across the country . " More people saw them than came to all performances combined , " says Leventhal . URBAN , AND URBANE , RENEWAL While Lincoln Center was growing and changing , something else was happening . The mean streets surrounding the campus  --  the former San Juan Hill , an area of dilapidated brownstones where gang fights had been more common than chamber music  --  changed also . New apartment blocks went up ; row houses were renovated ; stores , restaurants and movie theaters moved in . Planters full of flowers replaced used syringes on the traffic islands in the middle of Broadway . The effect , to one who grew up in New York and saw these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ripples . This campus full of music and ballet students , of singers and directors , of audiences filling the streets until late at night , made a difference in the city around it . From 1962 to 2003 , taxable-property values in the neighborhood increased 2,608 percent , compared with 447 percent for the rest of Manhattan . And by 2003 , Lincoln Center 's 9,000 full-time , part-time and contract workers were earning $350 million in wages , which in turn generated further spending  --  by the earners and their suppliers  --  of $190 million in New York City , $315 million in New York State and $395 million in the metropolitan region . Its audiences pumped $427 million in business into New York City 's economy , supporting more than 4,400 non-Lincoln Center jobs , with similar numbers for the state and metropolitan region . Lincoln Center , in short , had become a powerful engine of economic growth , and it had shown others how to do likewise . " It not only spawned the redevelopment of the West Side of New York , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is a major donor to , and cochairman of , the fundraising group Bravo Lincoln Center Campaign and vice chairman of Lincoln Center , " but it also spawned the development of comparable complexes around the United States , like the Kennedy Center , in Washington , D.C. " So when Lincoln Center 's half-century mark was approaching , Beverly Sills , who had become chairman of the board in 1994 , proposed that the occasion be celebrated with more than a birthday cake . After decades of continuous occupancy , the campus 's buildings and outdoor spaces were showing signs of wear and tear : carpets were threadbare , seats needed replacing , offices were overcrowded , stonework was leaky . And Lincoln Center 's own success had made aspects of its original layout impractical or obsolete . In 2001 a massive fundraising effort was begun to generate $1.2 billion for construction costs , some of which would go toward redeveloping the Lincoln Center campus and some of which would be applied as matching funds for projects financed by the individual constituents . New York City agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ranging from $3 million to $20-plus million each ) from corporations , foundations and numerous Lincoln Center supporters , among them Bruce and Suzie Kovner ( in the $20-million-or-more category ) , the Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund ( $10 million or more ) , Alice and David Rubenstein ( $5 million or more ) and Katherine Farley and the Speyer Family Foundation ( $3 million or more ) . Within this ambitious framework , the constituent arts groups were asked to come up with wish lists of improvements and invited to participate in the redevelopment planning . And true to form , that 's when the trouble started . Some of it arose from old dissatisfactions about architecture and acoustics and caused both City Opera and the Philharmonic to propose leaving Lincoln Center altogether  --  City Opera for a site in Lower Manhattan and the Phil for a mariage de convenance with Carnegie Hall . But most of it emanated from the Met , where the general manager , Joseph Volpe , an iron-willed former stage carpenter , joined with Sills to ax plans for a Frank Gehry-designed atrium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a new home for City Opera in Damrosch Park , adjacent to the Met , and staged a series of divalike withdrawals from the planning process that seemed aimed only at increasing his ( and the Met 's ) control over the redevelopment . " There was a lot of agita caused by Volpe stirring the pot , " says Lincoln Center Theater 's artistic director , Andr Bishop . But , fortunately , the incoming president , Reynold Levy , and Frank A. Bennack Jr. , who became chairman of the board in June 2005 ( and who is also chief executive officer of the Hearst Corporation , Town &; Country 's parent company ) , were equal to the task of taking that pot off the fire . " Anytime you have strong-willed individuals , you 're going to have a difference of opinion , " says Bennack diplomatically . Adds Levy : " There was a considerable level of friction and a lack of focus on common needs . It required a vision and a willingness to listen really carefully to very proud , very high-class organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening process was indubitably helped by Volpe 's retirement , in August 2006 , and by the ascent , at nearly all the constituent organizations , of people who have almost literally grown up with Lincoln Center and feel a connection and commitment to it : Bishop ; the Met 's new general manager , Peter Gelb ; the music director designate of the Philharmonic , Alan Gilbert ; and Juilliard 's president , Joseph Polisi . All are native New Yorkers who attended performances in Lincoln Center 's halls as boys . Gilbert used to queue up for standing-room tickets at the Met ; Polisi played bassoon in the All-City High School Orchestra in Philharmonic Hall . New York City Ballet 's Peter Martins may have been a latecomer when he arrived at Lincoln Center from Denmark in 1967 , but its effect on him was just as indelible . " It was huge and glamorous , " he recalls , " like entering a new world . " The Lincoln Center in whose transformation they are participating is a new new world , explains Katherine Farley , a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philharmonic board member who is chairman of Lincoln Center Development Project and vice chairman of Lincoln Center . " The original design task , " Farley says , " was to create a safe enclave in a difficult neighborhood , so it was very inwardly focused . That project was so successful that the task now is to reverse the inward focus so the neighborhood and passersby feel invited in . " The job of expressing this transparency and accessibility in bricks and mortar was given to the innovative architecture firm Diller Scofidio &; Renfro , whose previous undertakings have included as many multimedia installations as fully realized buildings . The critic Paul Goldberger , in a recent issue of the New Yorker , remarked that " they have turned out to be exactly what the place needed . " Diller Scofidio persuaded Lincoln Center to replace with glass the windowless travertine walls that lined 65th Street , demolish the pedestrian bridge that had turned the street into a dank tunnel and construct a restaurant topped by a sloping grass-planted " lawn " where the southern edge of the bridge had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square stone facade of the Juilliard School , which sat unforgivingly on its trapezoidal lot on the corner of Broadway , replacing it with angled glass walls extending over the thoroughfare like the prow of a ship and making room within for new studios visible from the street , as well as a spacious new lobby for Alice Tully Hall . At the main entrance to the campus , on Columbus Avenue , the architects planned to sink the service road that separated the plaza from the street and replace it with a grand stairway , its risers illuminated by LED lighting . And throughout the campus they called for new signage , as well as information and ticket booths , to make Lincoln Center 's events and venues easily navigable by first-time visitors and old hands alike . Interestingly , much of what Diller Scofidio aims to achieve architecturally in the travertine Acropolis seems to be already happening in artistic and human terms . In contrast to the old Lincoln Center , where , Bishop says , " we never talked to one another , " many of the Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of projects . Gelb has already brought Lincoln Center Theater directors to the Met , like Bartlett Sher , who directed Il Barbiere di Siviglia in 2006 , and he and Bishop are collaborating on a series of workshops for commissioned pieces using artists from both theaters . Peter Martins came early to the idea , choreographing a ballet ( the 1993 " Jazz " ) to Wynton Marsalis 's music , which was performed live . In the fall of 2010 the Met 's Young Artists Program and the Juilliard Opera will be merged , and Gilbert , who plans to conduct the Juilliard Orchestra as well as the Phil , is " very excited " about bringing those same singers to work at Avery Fisher Hall . As for the old specter of competition between Lincoln Center Inc. and the other constituents , Gilbert dismisses it : " The more active and the richer the music scene is in New York , the better it is for everybody . A rising tide lifts all boats . " Such optimism seems almost quixotic in the middle of the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November caused City Opera 's general director designate , Gerard Mortier , to resign in the face of cost constraints and is forcing some of Lincoln Center 's constituents to freeze salaries , slash budgets , pare personnel rosters , defer new projects or leverage assets . ( The Met , for instance , has put the monumental Chagalls in its lobby up as collateral for a loan . ) But tell that to Levy . " Remember that it was during a depression that the Brooklyn Bridge was built and that the Empire State Building was built , " he says . Or ask anyone who attended the February opening of the completely reconstructed Alice Tully Hall . An acoustically bright and resonant space well-suited to both early and contemporary music , it 's also beautiful , with gray Ultrasuede seating and wood panels hiding LED lights that can bring about a subtle glow  --  in all , an auspicious first step for Lincoln Center 's redesign team , and one that was greeted with excitement by music and architecture critics alike . Even better , talk to anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did any of the following at Lincoln Center : attended a semistaged version of John Adams 's Death of Klinghoffer , conducted by the composer at Juilliard 's Peter Jay Sharp Theater ; heard film and musical-theater star Alan Cumming , salsa great Eddie Palmieri or legendary tenor saxophonist Benny Golson at one of Jazz at Lincoln Center 's three venues ; cheered Thomas Hampson and Karita Mattila in Tchaikovsky 's Eugene Onegin at the Metropolitan Opera ; celebrated Mendelssohn 's bicentennial with conductor Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic ; saw New York City Ballet in George Balanchine 's " Theme and Variations " or Jerome Robbins 's " Dances at a Gathering " ; luxuriated in the fully orchestrated , Tony Award-winning revival of South Pacific at Lincoln Center Theater ; or browsed through an exhibit on the history of Dance Theater of Harlem at the Library for the Performing Arts . Such an array of events would be impressive spread out across a city of any size . To find it concentrated in one five-block area is extraordinary . No wonder David Rubenstein  --  who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's continued evolution  --  claims that he has " never met a single person in all our fundraising who has said no . " The reason , he says , is that " people love Lincoln Center . " GREAT GIVERS , 1959-2009 You do n't get to be fifty without making a lot of interesting friends .
