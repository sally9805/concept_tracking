Bartimaeus Trilogy #3  --  Ptolemy 's Gate by Jonathan Stroud Alexandria : 125 BC The assassins dropped into the palace grounds at midnight , four fleet shadows dark against the wall . The fall was high , the ground was hard ; they made no more sound on impact than the pattering of rain . Three seconds they crouched there , low and motionless , sniffing at the air . Then away they stole , through the dark gardens , among the tamarisks and date palms , toward the quarters where the boy lay at rest . A cheetah on a chain stirred in its sleep ; far away in the desert , jackals cried . They went on pointed toe-tips , leaving no trace in the long wet grass . Their robes flittered at their backs , fragmenting their shadows into wisps and traces . What could be seen ? Nothing but leaves shifting in the breeze . What could be heard ? Noth-ing but the wind sighing among the palm fronds . No sight , no noise . A crocodile djinni , standing sentry at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale 's breadth of his tail . For humans , it was n't badly done . The heat of the day was a memory ; the air was chill . Above the palace a cold round moon shone down , slathering silver across the roofs and courtyards . Away beyond the wall , the great city murmured in the night : wheels on dirt roads , distant laughter from the pleasure district along the quay , the tide lapping at its stones . Lamplight shone in windows , embers glowed on roof hearths , and from the top of the tower beside the harbor gate the great watch fire burned its message out to sea . Its image danced like imp-light on the waves . At their posts , the guards played games of chance . In the pillared halls , the servants slept on beds of rushes . The palace gates were locked by triple bolts , each thicker than a man . No eyes were turned to the western gardens , where death came calling , secret as a scorpion , on four pairs of silent feet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace . Four black shadows hunched beneath the wall . The leader made a signal . One by one they pressed against the stonework ; one by one they began to climb , suspended by their fingertips and the nails of their big toes . In this manner they had scaled marble columns and waterfalls of ice from Massilia to Hadhramaut ; the rough stone blocks were easy for them now . Up they went , like bats upon a cave wall . Moonlight glinted on bright things suspended in their mouths . The first of the assassins reached the window ledge : he sprang tigerlike upon it and peered into the chamber . Moonlight spilled across the room ; the pallet was lit as if by day . The boy lay sleeping , motionless as one already dead . His dark hair fell loose upon the cushions , his pale lamb " s throat shone against the silks . The assassin took his dagger from between his teeth . With quiet deliberation , he surveyed the room , gauging its extent and the possibility of traps . It was large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling . In the distance stood a door of teak , barred on the inside . A chest , half filled with clothes , sat open against the wall . He saw a royal chair draped with a discarded cloak , sandals lying on the floor , an onyx basin filled with water . A faint trace of perfume hung on the air . The assassin , for whom such scents were decadent and corrupt , wrinkled his nose . His eyes narrowed ; he reversed the dagger , holding it between finger and thumb by its shining , gleaming tip . It quivered once , twice . He was gauging the range here-he 'd never missed a target yet , from Carthage to old Colchis . Every knife he 'd thrown had found its throat . His wrist flickered ; the silver arc of the knife 's flight slice the air in two . It landed with a soft noise , hilt-deep in the cushion , an inch from the child 's neck . The assassin paused in doubt , still crouched upon the sill . The back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adept of the dark academy . An adept never missed his target . The throw had been exact , precisely calibrated . . . Yet it had missed . Had the victim moved a crucial fraction ? Impossible  --  the boy was fast asleep . From his person he pulled a second dagger . Another careful aim ( the assassin was conscious of his brothers behind and below him on the wall : he felt the grim weight of their impatience ) . A flick of the wrist , a momentary arc  - -  With a soft noise , the second dagger landed in the cushion , an inch to the other side of the prince 's neck . As he slept , perhaps he dreamed-a smile twitched ghostlike at the corners of his mouth . Behind the black gauze of the scarf that masked his face , the assassin frowned . From within his tunic he drew a strip of fabric , twined tightly into a cord . In seven years since the Hermit had ordered his first kill , his garrote had never snapped , his hands had never failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sill and stole across the moonlit floor . In his bed the boy murmured something . He stirred beneath his sheet . The assassin froze rigid , a black statue in the center of the room . Behind , at the window , two of his companions insinuated themselves upon the sill . They waited , watching . The boy gave a little sigh and fell silent once more . He lay face up amongst his cushions , a dagger 's hilt protruding on either side . Seven seconds passed . The assassin moved again . He stole around behind the cushions , looping the ends of the cord around his hands . Now he was directly above the child ; he bent swiftly , set the cord upon the sleeping throat  - -  The boy 's eyes opened . He reached up a hand , grasped the assassin 's left wrist and , without exertion , swung him headfirst into the nearest wall , snapping his neck like a reed stalk . He flung off his silken sheet and , with a bound , stood free , facing the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two assassins hissed like rock snakes . Their comrade 's death was an affront to their collective pride . One plucked from his robe a pipe of bone ; from a cavity between his teeth he sucked a pellet , eggshell thin , filled with poison . He set the pipe to his lips , blew once : the pellet shot across the room , directed at the child 's heart . The boy gave a skip ; the pellet shattered against a pillar , spattering it with liquid . A plume of green vapor drizzled through the air . The two assassins leaped into the room ; one this way , the other that . Each now held a scimitar in his hand ; they spun them in complex flourishes about their heads , dark eyes scanning the room . The boy was gone . The room was still . Green poison nibbled at the pillar ; the stones fizzed with it . Never once in seven years , from Antioch to Pergamum , had these assassins lost a victim . Their arms stopped moving ; they slowed their pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fear . From behind a pillar in the center of the room came the faintest scuffling , like a mouse flinching in its bed of straw . The assassins glanced at each other ; they inched forward , toe-tip by toe-tip , scimitars raised . One went to the right , past the crumpled body of his fellow . One went to the left , beside the golden chair , draped with the cloak of kings . They moved like ghosts around the margins of the room , circling in upon the pillar from both sides . Behind the pillar , a furtive movement : a boy 's shape hiding in the shadows . Both assassins saw it ; both raised their scimitars and darted in , from left , from right . Both struck with mantis-speed . A dual cry , gargling and ragged . From round the pillar came a stumbling , rolling mess of arms and legs : the two assassins , locked together in a tight embrace , each one skewered on the other 's sword . They fell forward into the pool of moonlight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . Silence . The windowsill hung vacant , nothing in it but the moon . A cloud passed across the bright round disc , blacking out the bodies on the floor . The signal fire in the harbor tower cast faint redness on the sky . All was still . The cloud drifted out to sea , the light returned . From behind the pillar walked the boy , bare feet soundless on the floor , his body stiff and wary , as if he sensed a pressure in the room . With careful steps , he neared the window . Slowly , slowly , closer , closer . . . He saw the shrouded mass of gardens , the trees and sentry towers . He noticed the texture of the sill , the way the moonlight caught its contours . Closer . . . Now his hands rested on the stone itself . He leaned forward to look down into the courtyard at the bottom of the wall . His thin white throat extended out . . . Nothing . The courtyard was empty . The wall below was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy listened to the quietness . He tapped his fingers on the sill , shrugged , and turned inside . Then the fourth assassin , clinging like a thin black spider to the stones above the window , dropped down behind him . His feet made the noise of feathers falling into snow . The boy heard ; he twisted , turned . A knife flashed , swiped , was deflected by a desperate hand-its edge clinked against stone . Iron fingers grappled at the boy 's neck ; his legs were knocked from under him . He fell , landing hard upon the floor . The assassin 's weight was on him . His hands were pinioned . He could not move . The knife descended . This time it met its mark . So it had finished as it must . Crouching above the body of the boy , the assassin allowed himself a breath-his first since his colleagues had met their ends . He sat back on his sinewy haunches , loosed his grip upon the knife , and let the boy 's wrist drop free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the fallen victim . At which point the boy reached up and plucked the knife from the center of his chest . The assassin blinked in consternation . " Not silver , you see , " the boy said . " Mistake . " He raised his hand . An explosion in the room . Green sparks cascaded from the window . The boy rose to his feet and tossed the knife upon the pallet . He adjusted his kilt and blew some flakes of ash from off his arms . Then he coughed loudly . The faintest of scrapings . Across the room the golden chair shifted . The cloak draped over it was nudged aside . Out from between its legs scrambled another boy , identical to the first , though flushed and tousled from many hours of hiding . He stood over the bodies of the assassins , breathing hard . Then he stared up at the ceiling . On it was the blackened outline of a man . It had a kind of startled look . The boy lowered his gaze to the impassive doppelganger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mock salute . Ptolemy brushed the dark hair from his eyes and bowed . " Thank you , Rekhyt , " he said . 1 Times change . Once , long ago , I was second to none . I could whirl through the air on a wisp of cloud and churn up dust storms with my passing . I could bore through mountains , raise castles on pillars of glass , fell forests with a single breath . I carved temples from the sinews of the earth and led armies against the legions of the dead , so that the harpers of a dozen lands played music in my memory and the chroniclers of a dozen centuries scribbled down my exploits . Yes ! I was Bartimaeus  --  cheetah-quick , strong as a bull elephant , deadly as a striking krait ! But that was then . And now . . . Well , right now I was lying in the middle of a midnight road , flat on my back and getting flatter . Why ? Because on top of me was an upturned building . Its weight bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might , I could not push free . In principle there 's nothing shameful about struggling when a building falls upon you . I 've had such problems before ; it 's part of the job description . But it does help if the edifice in question is glamorous and large . And in this case , the fearsome construction that had been ripped from its foundations and hurled upon me from a great height was neither big nor sumptuous . It was n't a temple wall or a granite obelisk . It was n't the marbled roof of an emperor 's palace . No . The object that was pinning me haplessly to the ground , like a butterfly on a collector 's tray , was of twentieth-century origin and of very specific function . Oh , all right , it was a public lavatory . Quite sizable , mind , but even so . I was glad no harpers or chroniclers happened to be passing . In mitigation , I must report that the lavatory in question had concrete walls and a very thick iron roof , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there were doubtless various pipes and cisterns and desperately heavy taps inside , all adding to the total mass . But it was still a pretty poor show for a djinni of my stature to be squashed by it . In fact , the abject humiliation bothered me more than the crushing weight . All around me the water from the snapped and broken pipework trickled away mournfully into the gutters . Only my head projected free of one of the concrete walls ; my body was entirely trapped . So much for the negatives . The good side was that I was unable to rejoin the battle that was taking place up and down the suburban street . It was a fairly low-key sort of battle , especially on the first plane . Nothing much could be seen . The house lights were all out , the electric street lamps had been tied in knots ; the road was dark as an inkstone , a solid slab of black . A few stars shone coldly overhead . Once or twice indistinct blue-green lights appeared and faded , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second plane , where two rival flocks of birds could be seen wheeling and swooping at each other , buffeting savagely with wings , beaks , claws and tails . Such loutish behavior would have been reprehensible amongst seagulls or other down-market fowl ; the fact that these were eagles made it all the more shocking . On the higher planes the bird guises were discarded altogether , and the true shapes of the fighting djinn came into focus.3 Seen from this perspective , the night sky was veritably awash with rushing forms , contorted shapes , and sinister activity . Fair play was entirely disregarded . I saw one spiked knee go crunching into an opponent 's belly , sending him spinning away behind a chimney to recover . Disgraceful ! If I 'd been up there I 'd have had no truck with that . But I was n't up there . I 'd been put out of action . Now , if it had been an afrit or marid who 'd done the damage , I could have lived with it . But it was n't . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind I could normally roll up in my pocket and smoke after dinner . I could still see her now from where I lay , her nimble feminine grace rather undermined by her pig 's head and the long rake she clutched in her trotters . There she was , standing on a postbox , laying left and right with such brio that the government forces , of which I was nominally a part , backed off and left her well alone . She was a formidable customer , with experience in Japan if her kimono was anything to go by . In truth , I 'd been misled by her rustic appearance and had ambled close without upping my Shields . Before I knew it , there was a piercing oink , a blur of movement and  --  whump !  --  she 'd left me pinned in the road , too weary to break free . Little by little , however , my side was gaining the upper hand . See ! Here strode Cormocodran , snapping off a lamppost and swinging it like a twig ; there raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The enemy dwindled and began to adopt ever more fatalistic guises . I saw several large insects buzzing and dodging , one or two wisps twisting frantically , a couple of rats heading for the hills . Only the she-pig stubbornly maintained her original appearance . My colleagues surged forward . One beetle went down in a corkscrew cloud of smoke ; a wisp was blown apart by a double Detonation . The enemy fled ; even the pig realized the game was up . She leaped gracefully onto a porch , somersaulted up onto a roof , and vanished . The victorious djinn set off in hot pursuit . It was quiet in the street . Water trickled past my ears . From topknot to toes , my essence was one long ache . I gave a heartfelt sigh . " Dear me , " a voice chuckled . " A damsel in distress . " I should have mentioned that in contrast to all the centaurs and ogres at my side , I 'd been wearing a human guise that night . It happened to be that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not based on anybody in particular , of course . The speaker appeared round the edge of the public convenience and paused to sharpen a nail against a snaggy bit of pipe . No delicate guise for him ; as usual he was decked out as a one-eyed giant , with lumpy muscles and long blond hair braided in a complex and faintly girly way . He wore a shapeless blue-gray smock that would have been considered hideous in a medieval fishing village . " A poor sweet damsel , too frail to prize herself free . " The cyclops considered one of his nails carefully ; finding it a little long , he bit at it savagely with his small sharp teeth and rounded it off against the pebbledash wall of the lavatory . " Mind helping me up ? " I inquired . The cyclops looked up and down the empty road . " Better watch out , love , " he said , leaning casually on the building so that its downward pressure increased . " There 's dangerous characters abroad tonight . Djinn and foliots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mischief . " " Can it , Ascobol , " I snarled . " You know full well it 's me . " The cyclops 's single eye batted becomingly under its layer of mascara . " Bartimaeus ? " he said in wonder . " Can it possibly be . . . ? Surely the great Bartimaeus would not be so easily snared ! You must be some imp or mouler cheekily adopting his voice and . . . But , no-I am wrong ! It is you . " He raised his eyebrow in an affectation of shock . " Incredible ! To think the noble Bartimaeus has come to this ! The master will be sorely disappointed . " I summoned my last reserves of dignity . " All masters are temporary , " I replied . " All humiliations likewise . I bide my time . " " Of course , of course . " Ascobol swung his apelike arms and did a little pirouette . " Well spoken , Bartimaeus ! You do not let your decline depress you . No matter that your great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a will-o ' - the- wisp ! No matter that your task tomorrow is as likely to be damp-dusting our master 's bedroom as roaming free upon the air . You are an example to us all . " I smiled , showing my white teeth . " Ascobol , " I said , " it is not I who have declined , but my adversaries . I have fought with Faquarl of Sparta , with Tlaloc of Tollan , with clever Tchue of the Kalahari-our conflicts split the earth , gouged rivers . I survived . Who is my enemy now ? A knock-kneed cyclops in a skirt . When I get out from here , I do n't see this new conflict lasting long . " The cyclops started back , as if stung . " Such cruel threats ! You should be ashamed . We are on the same side , are we not ? Doubtless you have good reasons for skulking out the fight under this restroom . Being polite , I will not trouble to inquire , though I may say that you lack your normal courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all away , " I said . " I am left irritable and jaded , with a perpetual itch in my essence that I can not scratch . And that makes me dangerous , as you will shortly learn . Now , for the last time , Ascobol , get this off . " Well , there were a few more tuts and pouts , but my posturing had its effect . With a single shrug of his hairy shoulders , the cyclops levered the lavatory up and off me , sending it clattering away onto the opposite pavement . A somewhat corrugated girl got unsteadily to her feet . " At last , " I said . " You took your own sweet time about it . " The cyclops plucked a bit of debris from his smock . " Sorry , " he said , " but I was too busy winning the battle to help you out before . Still , all 's well . Our master will be pleased-by my efforts , anyhow . " He glanced at me sidelong . Now that I was vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damage to the houses all around . Not too bad . A few broken roofs , smashed windows . . . The skirmish had been successfully contained . " A French lot ? " I asked . The cyclops shrugged , which was some feat given that he lacked a neck . " Maybe . Possibly the Czechs or Spanish . Who can tell ? They 're all nibbling at us nowadays . Well , time presses and I must check on the pursuit . I leave you to nurse your aches and pains , Bartimaeus . Why not try peppermint tea or a camomile footbath , like other geriatrics ? Adieu ! " The cyclops hitched up his skirts and , with a ponderous spring , launched himself into the air . Wings appeared on his back ; with great plowing strokes he drew away . He had all the grace of a filing cabinet , but at least he 'd got the energy to fly . I had n't . Not until I 'd had a breather , anyhow . The dark-haired girl crept across to a broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the gasps and gingerly movements of an invalid , she slumped down into a sitting position and cupped her head in her hands . She closed her eyes . Just a brief rest . Five minutes would do . Time passed , dawn came . The cold stars faded in the sky .
