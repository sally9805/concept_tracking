" The Machine That Changed the World , " as a study at M.I.T. called it , is n't the telephone or even the automobile . It 's the devastatingly efficient assembly-line method called the Toyota Production System ( TPS ) , which has revolutionized the way factories are run worldwide . Few people have done more to perfect " the Toyota Way " than chairman Hiroshi Okuda , 71 , and president Fujio Cho , 67 , with a combined 93 years at Toyota between them . Toyota 's first two CEOs not to hail from the company 's founding Toyoda clan , Okuda and Cho have taught hundreds of companies the TPS secrets of eliminating waste , reducing defects and maximizing flow . " From the very beginning , Toyota learned much from other carmakers , " says Cho . " Sharing what we have discovered since then is one way we can give something back . " <P> Despite such magnanimity , Toyota is a tenacious competitor . After years of turbocharged growth , the company is running neck and neck with Ford to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But its leaders acknowledge that efficiency is not enough if Toyota 's growth is to continue . " We need to continue innovating , " says Okuda . That explains a campaign to shift the industry from its dependence on petroleum-based fuels . Despite widespread skepticism , Toyota pressed on with the Prius , the world 's first mass-market petroleum-electric hybrid car . A hybrid SUV is scheduled for release this fall . " Any carmaker who says hybrid cars ca n't be profitable , " Okuda muses , " I would tell them to start looking for a new line of work . "  --  By Jim Frederick .
