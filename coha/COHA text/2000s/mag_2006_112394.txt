When Mitch Canham was in first grade , he had nightmares that filled the dark with wolves , dragons and bogeymen . He told his mother , who rummaged through the experiences of her own youth for help . She handed him a dream catcher-a Native American totem made of a hoop and string-and hung it in front of his bedroom window . " Now , when you sleep , your dreams will have to pass through this , " said his mother , Kim , who would die of a drug overdose in 2003 . " The good dreams will get through , but the bad ones will get tangled up and go away . " // Fifteen years later Canham is a redshirt sophomore and Oregon State 's dream catcher , hitting .299 with 54 RBIs in 64 games . He caught a trio of dream pitchers from the Beaver State in a dream season that ended on Monday night in Omaha when his team beat North Carolina 3-2 in the clincher of the College World Series . // Oregon State ( 50-16 ) seized its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-of-three championship series , then overcoming a 5-0 deficit in Game 2 . Before last week the Beavers had never won a CWS game , going 0-2 last year and in 1952 , their only other appearances . Until recently the team , coached by Pat Casey , had been a perennial Pac-10 doormat . " Coach recruited me by saying he thought we would win a Pac-10 title , " recalled sophomore shortstop Darwin Barney . " I thought he was full of crap . " Barney signed on anyway and was the conference freshman of the year as Oregon State won the league title for the first time in 53 years , then repeated this spring . // The program began its turnaround when Casey signed high school pitchers Dallas Buck , Kevin Gunderson and Jonah Nickerson , all Oregon natives , in ' 04 . Last Saturday in the series opener , Buck , now an All-America ( 12-3 , 3.44 ERA ) , was matched against All-World Andrew Miller ( 13-2 , 2.36 ) , one of two UNC starters who had been first-round picks in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually unseeable , never mind unhittable , until the sixth inning , when he was knocked out of the game by a two-run homer by junior leftfielder Cole Gillespie . // With the score tied at three in the eighth , Tar Heels first baseman Chad Flack tripled and scored the deciding run on a passed ball that glanced off Canham 's shin guard and rolled to the backstop . Asked later to describe the play , Canham , who went 9 for 27 in Omaha , grumbled , " Got passed . He scored . They win . " // North Carolina jumped to a 5-0 lead on Sunday , but in the bottom of the fourth inning Tar Heels righthander Robert Woodard plunked leadoff hitter Tyler Graham . " After that , " Woodard said , " I do n't even recall what happened . " To refresh Woodard 's memory , he surrendered a single , issued a walk and gave up a two-run double that earned him an early shower . His replacement , Matt Danford , may never forget what followed : a single , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by senior first baseman Bill Rowe . At the end of the inning the Beavers led 7-5 ; at the end of the game , 11-7. // Monday 's finale was an exhilarating chess match of countermove and counter-countermove , with Nickerson , Buck and Gunderson all taking the ball and North Carolina even attempting a steal of home . The Beavers gnawed out a victory by taking an early 2-0 lead , then scoring the winning run on a throwing error with two out in the eighth inning . " My mom 's watching over me , " Canham exulted afterward . " This is obviously a dream . "
