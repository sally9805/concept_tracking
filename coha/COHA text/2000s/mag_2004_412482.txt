Whether you 're starting out or well on your way these six simple rules are all you need to know by Marion Asnes // It 's easy to feel anxious about your retirement . Even if you 've been saving for years , it 's natural to wonder if you 've made the right decisions . And if you have n't begun saving yet , well , the fear that you 're starting too late can be daunting enough to keep you from getting in the game at all . But that 's a mistake . Sure , there are many questions ( Am I saving enough ? Am I adequately diversified ? Do I have the best investments ? ) . It can all seem overwhelming-and , therefore , well worth avoiding . Most of us lead frantically busy lives anyway , so tending a portfolio can easily slip down the to-do list . What 's more , when you have a jumble of investments-401(k)s from two or three jobs , assorted IRAs , maybe an online brokerage account-simply keeping track of it all can turn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a better way . MONEY has created a simple system for getting your retirement on track , using principles you can learn in just 15 minutes . Our plan includes no detailed calculations of future living costs , or worksheets for locating every penny of your net worth . But that does n't mean this program is n't sophisticated . Basically , we 've done the heavy lifting and distilled retirement planning into a flexible system that can grow with you . Best of all : Once you put our plan into action , you need to do very little-about 15 minutes ' worth of work a year-to maintain it . And that will liberate lots of time to , say , play with your kids or figure out your next vacation . So let 's get to it . 1 Ignore the big number Most retirement planners have you start by calculating how much you 'll need to retire comfortably . If seeing that number is important to you , use the Retirement Planner at money . com/retirement to come up with one . But we say do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly meaningful unless you plan to stop working fairly soon . Beyond five to 10 years , the future is essentially unknowable . None of us can accurately predict what our lifestyle , taxes or health benefits will cost , or what our investments will earn . We do n't even know what we 'll earn down the road . What 's more , the huge numbers that retirement calculators tend to spit out ( got a couple million bucks hanging around ? ) may do little more than discourage you from getting started . 2 Get in the game You ca n't control the future , but the present is in your hands . Your first step is to get into the habit of saving , so your money has more time to work for you . One recent study claims we need to save up to 17% of our income for retirement . Do n't let that scare you . Any savings , however modest , will help . We 'd start by putting at least 5% of your income into a tax-deferred retirement plan-be it a 401(k) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make sure to save enough to qualify for the entire match . Wherever you start , you can gradually work your way up . " We tell people to save what they 're comfortable with , but raise it by 1% to 2% of their salary every year , " says Steve Utkus , director of the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research . " It 's these small , incremental changes that get you where you want to go . " Want proof ? Professors Shlomo Benartzi of UCLA and Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago devised a savings program based on this idea called Save More Tomorrow ( SMarT ) , which is now being adopted by 401(k) providers such as Vanguard . Under the program , workers agree to boost their 401(k) contributions automatically by two to three percentage points with each annual raise until they hit their company 's max . During a four-year test of the SMarT plan at a mid-size corporation , participants ' average savings rates jumped from 3.5% of their pretax pay to 13.6% . Powerful stuff . 3 Put yourself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to make it automatic , and that 's why your 401(k) , 403(b) or 457 should be the centerpiece of your retirement . Your employer takes the money out of your paycheck before you can spend it ( or pay taxes on it ) , so you save regularly without even trying . If you do n't have a workplace savings plan-or you can save more than your plan allows-set up an automatic investment program with a fund company , bank or brokerage . A phone call , a sinipie form and a voided check are all it takes for you to have money debited from your bank account every month and deposited in a mutual fund . Automatic investing not only ensures that you will save consistently , it also makes you a better investor . If you invest regularly ( a technique called dollar-cost averaging ) , you wind up buying more shares when the price is low . What 's more , setting up an automatic investing plan often lets you open a fund account with much less money-as little as $100 a month-than if you started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take advantage of whatever tax breaks you qualify for . Even if your IRA deposits are not deductible , for instance , the money gets the oomph of growing tax deferred . If you qualify for a Roth IRA ( joint filers with incomes below $150,000 , singles below $95,000 , can put in the full $3,000 a year ) , your money grows completely tax-free . If you 're self-employed , you can save the lesser of $40,000 or 25% of your income in a simplified employee pension plan , or SEP-IRA . If you 're over 50 , take advantage of IRA and 401(k) catch-up provisions that allow you to put away more money-$500 more in IRAs in 2004 and 2005. 4 Do n't obsess over " portfolio building " Many financial advisers and retirement websites will try to wow you with their " optimizers " software programs that direct exactly how much of your savings should go into different asset classes . Do n't be intimidated . Truth is , building a well-diversified portfolio is a lot easier than that . Simply put 60% of your money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , and bonds provide ballast . You do n't need to change that mix until you 're about ready to retire . ( If you can stomach more risk , a larger dollop of stocks is perfectly okay , especially if you 're under 50 . But we 'd be wary about encouraging even young savers to put more than 80% in stocks . ) By the way , count the cash in your retirement accounts as part of your bond portfolio . 5 Stick with a few funds To get a 60-40 stock and bond mix , all you need are two broadly diversified index funds : Vanguard Total Stock Market ( 800-8514999 ) or Fidelity Spartan Total Market Index ( 800-343-3548 ) for the stock portion and Vanguard Total Bond Market for bonds . Why index funds ? With stocks expected to return an average of 7% to 8% a year over the next decade , you must minimize costs , and index funds are among the least expensive on the market . If your retirement plan does not offer index funds , a well-diversified stock fund such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 800421-0180 ) can fit the stock-index slot ; Pimco Total Return ( 800426-0107 ) will give you a broad exposure to bonds . If managing two funds is still more than you want to deal with , you can go even simpler with a life-cycle fund . These funds hold both stocks and bonds , and reduce your stock exposure as you near retirement . Vanguard Target Retirement funds ( 800-851-4999 ) , Fidelity Freedom funds ( 800343-3548 ) and T. Rowe Price Retirement funds ( 800-6385660 ) all let you choose from several target dates . 6 Update your plan annually Even a simple strategy requires periodic maintenance . But we 've distilled that job to three easy steps . * Rebalance . Once you create a 60-40 stock and bond mix , your only other job is to check those numbers once a year . If your allocation is less than five to 10 percentage points out of whack , you can wait to make changes . But if , say , the stocks take off and grow to 75% of your portfolio , sell enough to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds . This guarantees that you 'll buy low and sell high . Plus , in a tax-sheltered plan , you wo n't owe taxes on those gains . * Squeeze out more savings . Staying on track means finding more money to save every year . But that does n't mean denying yourself . Instead , keep tabs on where your money is going and make sure you 're getting what you expect from your splurges. * Check your debt load . If you 're having trouble finding enough money to save , check to see if your credit-card debt is holding you back . ( For advice on assessing your debt load , see " Know What You Owe " on page 143 . ) Paying off that tab should be a priority . Once you 've done so , put the money you used to send to credit-card companies into your retirement savings plan .
