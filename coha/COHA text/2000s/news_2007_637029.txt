<p> Washington  --  The House is set today to take up a nonbinding resolution condemning White House plans to increase U.S. forces in Iraq , kicking off up to four days of debate on a conflict that has split the country and taken the lives of more than 3,100 U.S. troops . <p> A vote could come Friday . If approved , the resolution could mark a first step toward more assertive legislation aimed at pressuring President Bush to begin a phased withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq , said Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( D-Texas ) . <p> " This is hardly the end , but the beginning of a debate that should have begun in Congress thousands of deaths ago , " said Doggett , a member of the House " Out of Iraq " caucus set up two years ago . <p> Opponents have cast the measure as a vote of no confidence in the U.S. mission in Iraq , and the debate could be a political minefield for several Georgia Democrats who represent districts with significant numbers of Republican voters . Those Democrats have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them , Rep. Jim Marshall of Macon , said Monday he will buck his party and vote against the nonbinding resolution . <p> Marshall , a Vietnam veteran and member of the Army Ranger Hall of Fame , has expressed reservations about Bush 's plan to send more troops to Baghdad . But he believes his party 's resolution would " undermine American resolve and send a message to the troops that their mission is not worthy , " said Marshall spokesman Doug Moore . <p> Several other Georgia Democrats plan to vote for the resolution despite their past support for the war . <p> Rep. David Scott of Atlanta , who has a long pro-defense record , has signed on as a co-sponsor of the resolution . The president 's plan to add troops would " strain an already overstrained military " and put more U.S. troops in the crossfire of a complex civil war , he said . <p> In a series of town hall meetings in traditionally conservative Cobb and Douglas counties over the weekend , Scott said he found widespread opposition to sending additional troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on finding a way to bring troops home , he said . <p> " The American people are opposed to it and you can not execute a war with the American people opposed to it , " Scott said . <p> Rep. Sanford Bishop of Albany has been critical of sending more troops to Iraq without clear benchmarks that would allow Americans to assess the troops ' progress . <p> " I 've got to take a look at it , but I 'm more than likely " to vote for it , Bishop said of the resolution . <p> Rep. John Barrow of Savannah , who survived one of the nation 's closest congressional re-election contests in November , could not be reached Monday . Barrow previously announced his opposition to some fellow Democrats ' proposal to cut off funding for the troop increase , a step not included in the nonbinding resolution . <p> The vote on the resolution will be easier for some Georgia Democrats . Rep. John Lewis of Atlanta is the only Georgian in the " Out of Iraq " caucus and was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is ready to cast one more vote against the president and the war . <p> " We 've got to bring it to an end and bring our young men and our young women home , " Lewis said . " This war , I think , is the greatest moral issue of our time . It is really tampering with the soul of America . " <p> So far , none of Georgia 's seven House Republicans has expressed opposition to the troop increase , although several have said the Iraqis need to take more responsibility for their own security . <p> They have also supported a GOP call for a congressional resolution that would affirm Congress ' commitment not to cut funding for the troops in Iraq , though the House resolution makes no mention of funding cuts . House Democratic leaders have said alternative measures will not be considered this week . <p> The House resolution is co-sponsored by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton ( D-Mo. ) , committee member Walter Jones ( R-N.C. ) , and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to support and protect " U.S. troops in Iraq but that it " disapproves of the decision " to increase U.S. force levels there . <p> Opponents have said the measure will hurt the American cause in Iraq . <p> " This week we are going to debate a nonbinding resolution that will do nothing but undermine the mission in Iraq , weaken the morale of our troops and embolden the enemy , " Rep. J. Gresham Barrett ( R-S.C. ) said in remarks on the House floor . He said the measure would enshrine in legislation " a policy of defeat and retreat . " <p> Each of the 435 House members will be allotted five minutes to speak  --  which would mean more than 36 hours of speeches if every member took full advantage of it . <p> The debate will be the most thorough congressional airing of concerns about the war since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 . <p> Senate Republicans used a procedural tactic last week to put off debate on the war and the plans for additional troops . <p> TEXT OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressing disapproval of President Bush 's troop increase in Iraq that the House will debate this week : <p> Resolved by the House of Representatives ( the Senate concurring ) , that  --  <p> ( 1 ) Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in Iraq ; and <p> ( 2 ) Congress disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush announced on January 10 , 2007 , to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq . <p>  --  Associated Press
