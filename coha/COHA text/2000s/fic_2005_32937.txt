Fifteen minutes later I was backing out of the parking lot . Johann sat beside me , jamming his storm trooper boots against the dashboard . He shook off my suggestion to use the seat belt . When I reminded him he was breaking the law , he snorted , " I thought America was a free country . " He strapped himself in and sank into a black mood . " My friend is not home , " he said . " I have no drugs for you . By the way , they are against the law too . " Suddenly the Filipino valet was running toward us , waving his arms and shouting in his native tongue . I panicked . Had he overheard Johann 's comment about drugs ? " What is he saying ? " I asked . Johann shrugged . Apparently , Tagalog was not one of his five languages . I kept the car sliding backwards , hoping to escape . But the tiny , brown-skinned valet threw himself onto the hood . Johann gripped my leg . " Ronnie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clunked against the windshield . Johann gestured for me to look out the window toward the rear of the car . I saw a line of metal teeth across the parking lot entrance and one of those signs that prepares you for SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE . The valet had been trying to warn me . " I 'm sorry ! " I shouted . I started the car toward the clearly designated exit , tossing a twenty out the window to appease him . Johann laughed so hard he gripped his sides . " Oh , Ronnie ! Ronnie ! You are crazy ! " Johann squeezed my leg again . Aroused , I turned the wrong way onto a one-way street . Johann unsnapped his seat belt . " I do n't think we worry about breaking the law tonight ! I will get you drugs , no problem ! Maybe I will do some too . Go down to Santa Monica Boulevard , " he commanded , referring to thefamous avenue that is ground zero for street hustlers . " I 'm sure you know where that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Santa Monica , where prostitutes in ragged , cut-off jeans and tank shirts clustered at bus stops and fast-food joints . Johann categorized them : " Trash . Drug addicts . They let a man fuck them without a condom for fifty bucks . Idiots . No future . No brains . No class . Keep driving east , Ronnie . I am looking for a friend who will get us drugs . He is German too . His name is Fred . I think he got out of jail last week . " I ventured a personal question : " How long have you been doing this ? " " What ? " he spit back , defiantly . " Well , you know ... Your work . Being a , um ... " Johann rapped his knuckles against the molded plastic dashboard . " Ronnie . I do n't think you are very important if they give you such a lousy car . " Before I could defend myself , Johann spotted his drug-dealing friend . " Pull over , that 's Fred . The one on crutches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we followed his directions toward Hollywood Boulevard . Fred was a scrawny kid with frizzy blond hair under a red bandana , wearing a sleeveless T-shirt with the American flag . He looked as if he was going to a costume party as a heroin addict from the 1970s . " Yeah , yeah , I can get you powder , " he said , in an accent thicker than Johann 's . Johann made introductions . " Fred , this is Ronnie . He is a terrible driver . You will probably die tonight . I hope you have made a confession recently . " " I never confess to anything ! " Fred proclaimed . " I take my secrets to the grave . I just got out of jail . You know what happens in jail to people who confess ? They get their hearts cut out with a shiv . " Johann rolled his eyes . " Fred . It was a joke . Ronnie , turn right at the corner . But first , stop at the red light . Good boy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded children . Fred directed us through the traffic of Hollywood Boulevard to a side street and a group of young black men lingering outside the Starview Hotel that offered rooms with three adult channels . " Give me some money , Ronnie . " I handed over two hundred dollars . Johann returned half . " Too much . " " But I want to make sure we get enough . " Johann held firm . " I have school tomorrow . I am sure you have to work . Let Johann take care of you tonight , okay ? " Tonight and forever , I thought . I wanted to kiss him and I wanted to cry . Johann put one hundred dollars into Fred 's bony hand . " One gram , Fred . " Fred leaned close . " Listen . These are Crips . I can do business with them . I joined their gang in jail . " Johann was delighted . " Oh yes , I am sure you are a Crip , Fred . You are a big Crip . You are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke gravely . " They do n't know me as Fred . I have a gang name . They call me Gestapo . " Johann put his hand over his heart as he laughed . Fred continued , " You must call me Gestapo . " " No , I am sorry , " Johann said , still laughing . " I must call you Fred . Go do business , Fred . Do n't cheat me , Fred , or I will kill you , Fred . Goodbye , Fred . " Johann shut the door and Fred hobbled away .
