I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE city women who claim that rape has nothing to do with sex only with violence . <p> On my farm , I own animals-male animals . A stallion , dog , tomcat , bull . Their mating behavior makes clear that nature consistently combines sex with violence , so it has always been unnatural for humans to impose their inventions of romantic love , marriage , fidelity , and foreplay , then device morals and laws-even commandments-to enforce them . <p> I 've never married-no surprise there . His only living child ( the disappointing daughter ) , I inherited in my teens these acres my Daddy had intended sons to divide . He and Mama are buried in the Greene family cemetery just beyond the west pasture , a plot fenced with black iron pickets he bought long ago at auction . Their graves are located well away from the small creek where livestock drinks , also downhill from the well and pumphouse . <p> Chester Evander Greene , says his tombstone . <p> Rosa Madox Greene , four years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was Ever Good Enough . <p> If Daddy had planned to produce obedient sons , Mama desired only baby girls , all to be named for flowers , but in a chain of miscarriages and stillbirths , only I survived . These incomplete babies lie under unmarked stones in the same graveyard , though Mama had her secret name for whatever lay under quartz and slate . <p> She named me Verbena . In school my name was first shortened to Bena Greene , then , because I was always tallest in my grade , to Green Bean . Townspeople still call me that behind my back , now that those C students have grown into shopkeepers and fat wives . <p> I live on the farm alone , but hire a neighbor boy for heavy work . When I get older ( I 'm forty-two ) I 'll hire two or three . <p> Only a few months ago our county agent , who went to college and thinks he 's Somebody , asked if I 'd ever seen any paintings by Grant Wood . <p> " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got flustered and pretended that either he had n't spoken or I had n't heard correctly . <p> Soon as I got home I called up samples on my computer . So I 'm an . American Gothic , am I ? He could have insulted me straight out instead of going around his elbow to get to his thumb . And I learned from the web something he surely did n't know about that painting , that Wood 's dentist was the model for the farmer holding his pitchfork , and Wood 's sister posed for the wife . <p> My parents could have been their blood kin . <p> Even miles from town , I do have a big desktop computer , a cellphone ; I own a wide-screen TV set and satellite dish , shortwave radio . Concerning all these , I only receive ; I do not send , except to e-mail those strangers I play in chess . <p> But I keep up with world and local news , so it was no surprise when early last May a small man carrying a clipboard knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway would be a boon to the county economy and would also slice an edge off my acreage . " At a fair market price , " he said through his crocodile smile , but I-not smiling-knew he meant eminent domain . <p> Keeping the screen between us , I said , " I must be way down your list of property owners . " <p> Being short , the man blamed me for making him stretch his neck . " It takes time finding people at home . " <p> " I 'm always home . " <p> His dark hair had been combed up , lengthened , then folded across his bald crown . From my angle I could count the pink tracks his comb had left . <p> Finally I came to sit in a front-porch rocker , so he was forced to take the next one , with no convenient surface for unrolling charts and plats . Fast as an auctioneer , he went into his spiel about traffic and urban sprawl and population growth until when finally he had to draw breath I asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's just a strip , really ! " He held out , then pinched together , his thumb and forefinger . " I tell the ladies the road and the right of way are just like turning up a hem . The widest part comes off your neighbors ' property . The Bellamys ? For you there 's only a line five hundred yards inside your western boundary . " <p> " West ? " I jumped up and let the chair rock backwards and hit the wall . " You do n't mean your road would go where my Mama and Daddy are buried ? " <p> " Any gravesites will be relocated with great care , with dignity in fact , and the state bears that cost to your entire satisfaction . The monuments , too , and you select the new location . " He nodded rapidly ; it unglued a hair or two . " That gives you an option for newer plantings . Boxwoods , for example . I see the honeysuckle is about to overtake ? " He waited . <p> I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snooping . Except to mow , I do n't go often myself . <p> Louder he said , " I also see that yours is surrounded by a low wrought-iron fence . We can move that intact . " <p> There would n't be a cupful of those unfinished babies to carry off . And nobody must ever move Daddy 's grave . <p> It must have been my scowl that was causing the man to lean slightly away , his hands rising by inches as if gravity had failed them . " Only one other family is left with your home-graveyard situation , and they 've chosen to transfer to the cemetery at their church . Baptist . " With lifted eyebrows he gave me a chance to submit a denomination , too , but I said nothing . " They were glad to have the upkeep taken care of ? We 'd bear the costs of acquiring a new plot , of course . Mrs. Greene ? " <p> " You 'll have to take your road well around the graveyard . " <p> " But the whole point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind spots . Give a straight shot ? " <p> " It 's Miss , " I said with emphasis . " Miss Verbena Greene . " <p> We did n't get far after that . <p> During many warm spring days after that visit , I did n't " mind " him or his damn road . My Mama , who came from some cove way back in the Appalachians and never lost her roots , would say " mind " when she meant " remember . " She also pronounced Arkansas with sass on its end , and spoke of the wounds of Christ so they rhymed with bounds and sounds , and thus seemed to me deeper . My Daddy said very little , to either one of us . <p> It was easy to set aside thoughts of the highway , since May means hard work in eastern North Carolina , with garden seeds to start , the yellowbell bushes and spireas to prune ; and because I follow the moon signs , I was keeping track of which days to sow aboveground or root crops in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to fertilize or pull noxious weeds . <p> It 's easy for the county agent to mock my Daddy 's farm notebook about the moon signs year to year , written in his tiny , left-leaning handwriting , done with a pencil whose lead he dipped inside his mouth . College professors do n't teach how a full moon , known to affect all water on earth , also draws soil moisture closer to roots . Air currents blowing across the world have their high and low intervals . Even big-city scientists admit that gravity not only shifts the tides but also moves the landmass twelve inches twice a day . And female ovaries once a month , for what that 's worth . <p> Truth be told , it 's not so much that I enjoy agriculture , no , but I like thinking about it , the whole theory of agriculture , the principles behind its grim routines . Certain days are those the stars prefer us to kill hogs , set hens , prime tobacco , breed mares , or even to drive a fence post securely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands are smeared with blood and manure and mucus , it feels as if my fingers have also plunged through an unseen barrier and are dodging between molecules into the immutable . Farming has taught me more than high school ever did , has shown me the cycles , how seasons and weathers roll , how the dead become compost . <p> In May and early June I did take time away from chores to check out the family graves , but nothing had been disturbed , at least not yet . <p> The day the first highwayman came ( yes , I like Noyes , all those old rhyming poems from English class ) we were into the sign of Taurus , productive and moist , and I had chores to get done before Gemini . So I did not " mind " the whole highway question for a week or so . <p> But late one May day the dog got flat-eared and barked , and I found a stranger already inside my back screen porch , examining one of Daddy 's duck decoys I 've left on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite the man that while I hung on to his collar with two hands , I got dragged onto the porch myself . <p> Ahead of the dog , this new man stepped smoothly outside , still holding a carved widgeon , and from a safe distance called , " No trouble , no problem . I 'm just surveying the road . " <p> " Not unless it 's coming through my house , you 're not . " But I could see he had dusty boots and no car , had walked to me overland . I said if he 'd give me a minute I 'd tie the dog , and then did . <p> He came back on the porch to study Daddy 's red-headed canvasbacks , which he used to carry on hunting and drinking trips to the coastal sounds . <p> " You make these ? " <p> " No . " <p> Anyway , the ducks do n't care . They 'll come down as quick for a block of wood with a head nailed on as they 'll light for those storebought plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . " <p> Used to . " I was sizing up this one-his bright blue eyes at the tall level of mine , reddish hair some army barber had mowed off even , and a narrow mustache that nobody 's worn since Clark Gable died . " Not to waste your time , mister ; I 'll not sell the land , and you 'll not move the graveyard . " <p> " That 's what I heard . " This time his northern accent came clearly through-as if our own surveyors were n't good enough . " It must have taken a lot of trouble to give these decoys eyes on both sides . No duck flying overhead could ever see these careful little eyes . " <p> Daddy would draw around a rifle shell to make each eye perfectly round , paint it perfectly black . Nobody dared interrupt his concentration . <p> The stranger ran his hand over the duck 's fat sides , which had been speckled by a toothbrush . " These would bring a good price at the beach . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . Was there something you wanted ? Mister ... ? " <p> But instead of giving his name , he turned to the table where I have my chessboard set up for play in the cool of the evening , and by it the stacks of paper that keep count of accumulated moves in several games at different stages . " Black or white ? " <p> " In this one , white . " <p> " You 've already won it then , " he said in a bored voice , and abruptly put out his hand . " Andrew Clement . " I did not lift my own hand , but he calmly caught hold of it anyway for one hard jerk , something you 'd use on a pump handle . " I 'm nowhere near your property yet , but I like to walk the whole route early . You 've got some nice forest land , never been timber-ed . " <p> I seldom say much back to people who tell me what I already know , but in spite of my hard look he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've got these positions written down ? Good . Then I 'll play you a game-you 're black . " <p> Here 's where I made a crucial mistake , by sitting down and waiting for Mr. Clement to bring his king 's pawn forward . Much as I like chess by e-mail and on the internet , I almost never get to play face-to-face . Once I entered a tournament in Raleigh , but it was all men ; everything was automated , with clocks and chess policemen , and players had to be body-searched for radio gear . <p> We made the usual developing moves for a while . " Your father teach you chess as well as hunting ? " <p> " No , one of my schoolteachers . " <p> " You 're not bad . " <p> " I 'm average . Go seventy miles from home anytime after age fifteen , and that 's what you keep learning-that you 're average . " He waited , expectant , holding his knight in midair so I could guess whether he 'd jump one-and-two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would n't even be average . " <p> We played thereafter in silence , he castling first , then building his attack along the king 's bishop line . I held my own for a while by trading off pieces of equal value , but he still had an extra pawn in the endgame , and that beat me . <p> With lips barely parted I said , " I do n't like to lose . " <p> " That 's easy to see . Take deep breaths before you pop an artery . What about some coffee ? Or tea ? Would n't it be good manners to offer me something ? " <p> Boiling oil , I thought , but was calming down when I poured two glasses of sweetened iced tea while he replaced each chessman in the wooden box . He called to the kitchen , " Are you a ranked player ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Was your teacher ? " <p> I did n't know . Had n't known enough about chess back then to ask , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the refrigerator door , touching the ice-cube tray . Cold as a morgue . I decided not to answer , so on that first day the name of Timothy Luce did not get said aloud by either of us . <p> Instead , Andrew Clement made small talk about his work , this flat countryside with its pines and scrub oaks so different from what he was used to , my orchard , my farm pond so deep the water looked black , what fish I stocked it with , and even Hoot , who had quit growling but lay semi-alert between us . Clement made every effort to scratch Hoot 's ears , to send me contagious smiles , even tried to make me laugh ; but I never for one minute forgot the highway project . <p> Perhaps he finally tired of making one-sided conversation . He rose , shook my hand as if the wrist joint needed to come loose , and thanked me for both game and tea . I could see him pause to take in my barn and toolshed , the empty silo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weathercock which way the wind was blowing . Then he set off , walking , down the road this time , toward town . <p> I knew he 'd be back . <p> The next weeks brought a hotter June with too little rain . I had to water my garden and the youngest fig bush . Andrew came by often , usually driving a dusty pickup truck he 'd park under the shade trees . He turned out to prefer lemonade over tea , so I kept a pitcher ready . Sometimes we played enough chess that I got my share of wins and draws . He 'd also show me things he had found wherever the faraway roadwork was-an arrowhead that should have been left where the Indian dropped it and time had layered it over , an old prescription bottle-deep sapphire blue-or a leaf he wanted me to identify . Once it was poison ivy , but he must have been immune . An empty terrapin shell . The skull of either a squirrel or a cat . Andrew was curious about everything . <p> " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The government introduced it . " <p> " What kind of wood did your father use to carve the ducks ? " " Red cedar-juniper , I guess it really is . " <p> " Did he make his own duck calls ? " <p> " Daddy did n't believe in them . He practiced the sounds himself . " Kept me awake with his nighttime squawks . I did n't tell Andrew that Daddy would also tie out tame or crippled birds , would bait the blind with corn . He did n't like losing , either . <p> " And did you eat the birds he shot ? " <p> " We had to . " <p> " Did slaves ever work this land ? " <p> " Lord , no . " <p> After another week , when I was in town buying horse feed , cow feed , and salt blocks , Hugo Thornton handed me change , tongued his cigar to one side , and said slyly , " I hear you 've got a boyfriend , Gr ... Verbena . " <p> I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such big ears , so they can hear everything that 's not so . " <p> Hugo Thornton and all his dumb friends tried out for Mr. Luce 's chess club , decades ago , and all dropped out . <p> But I drove home in a numb condition , not helped even by knowing that Hugo had flunked every course Timothy Luce taught . During his last semester here , when Mr. Luce first took an interest in me , when he said my essays meant I ought to go on to college instead of trying to run the homeplace by myself and finish school as well , when we played such earnest chess games after class , the other kids-including frizzyhaired Hugo Thornton-called me teacher 's pet . Later they 'd ask if I 'd finally got a boyfriend and if I could n't do any better than an old man . He was n't all that old . Not forty yet . <p> In such an uneasy state of memory , I almost missed my own turnoff , and then was a little late hitting the brake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been sitting on its bed with legs dangling , but flung his boots skyward to make sure I did n't crush him . The movement rolled him backwards , over , and up again , swearing . <p> " Sorry ! " I jumped out , calling but also trying not to laugh . " Are you all right ? I 'm so sorry . " <p> Only a few inches separated our vehicles . " Goddamn , were you asleep or what ? " <p> What , I almost said . <p> My laughter , and his-they changed the balance . Until then I 'd been watching to see what Andrew Clement was up to . Now , in a single instant he looked different to me . Better . It 's hard to explain . <p> " I got your cat out of the tree . " He pointed . <p> " Probably he was there on purpose , catching birds . " <p> He helped me unload . Together we fed the animals , something we 'd never done before . The humid air was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chores and our usual close game , I asked if he 'd stay for supper . <p> " Thought you 'd never ask . I 've got a bottle of wine in the truck , had it waiting for a week . Just in case . " <p> " Good . My scuppernong 's too sweet for steaks . " <p> We ate on the back porch , our meal spread on our chess table , and we listened to bullfrogs advertise for mates in the pond and to the taptap of night beetles as they bruised themselves against the screen . Hoot tried to get his nose on my plate and had to be put outside . <p> Except for praising the meal , Andrew ate without much talk , but he was an expert on frequent , long gazes . If I turned my face , his stare only waited my return . I could not sit still . Our silence enlarged like a cloud on my vision , a pressure in my throat . Dim light from the single lamp shadowed his eye sockets , turned half his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a dagger slash . His mouth opened and closed upon darkness . <p> I had forgotten ( for so long had not minded ) this very specific tension that first impales the mind and then the body . Years without it had passed since high school . <p> But I kept dodging the looks he aimed into me . I was not willing to invite him first . I waited and pretended , clumsy with knife and fork , my breath going shallow , the meat dropping down my throat like gravel . <p> Of course he knew . My weak evasions must have made the dark and light come and go in my own face . <p> Between eating and looking , Andrew finished his meal with deliberation , even the ice cream that seemed to melt in the spoon the minute it touched his lips . At last he reached across our plates-his empty , mine not-to touch my hand , turn it over , stroke the palm with one warm finger . <p> Then he gripped mine within his two and moved them side to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted table and came back . <p> " Can I stay ? " <p> We fed Hoot my leftovers and went to bed . <p> Even if Andy had not said so , he was bound to be surprised . <p> Old maid , old virgin-that 's what he expected . <p> Next morning he sat up in bed so I could see the spools of his spine , climb them with my thumb . He sorted through choices of words before he began , " In town they say you have n't , that you never- " <p> " Fucked , " I broke in . " And what else do they say ? " I ducked under his hand , swung out of bed and into the rattiest bathrobe I own . " Are they taking bets ? Since they 're sure I have n't , who 's taking odds that for you I will ? Maybe Hugo Thornton is holding the money ? " <p> While he murmured , " Who ? " I slammed into the kitchen , got out two iron skillets because they make such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to the doorway , watching me lay out bacon strips . " Verbena ? I never meant that I 've been prying . Or people gossiping . " <p> " But you have and they do . " <p> He crossed the kitchen to hug me from behind . Even so gentle an ambush , the slightest confinement , naturally made me squirm . We were of a size , our faces alongside , his scratchy chin pressed into my neck as if fastened there . I stepped away to the counter to beat eggs in their bowl , but my body seemed to drag him along , attached . <p> With a hiss , the bacon began slowly to give up its fat . I said while slapping those eggs with vigor , " What are they saying in town ? That I 've been completely withdrawn for years and years ever since my schoolteacher moved away ? " <p> Flattened against my back , the length of him grew stiffer . On the left side both our hearts seemed too loud for good health . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " And what do you tell the highway folks ? That soon they 'll get their land ? " <p> His arms dropped free of me . It was too soon , but I turned the bacon anyway . There was a motionless time after our connection broke , before Andrew stepped away into the bedroom . My back cooled off . Then I could hear him finding clothes and shoes . I turned off the flame under both pans before going to stand on the porch and look toward the misty pond . The cow that was due to calve soon stood in the shallow edge . Despite a sense of slow strangulation , I would not cry ; after all , I 've always known what men are like . <p> Andrew Clement finally came out too . Even through my shoulderblades I could see him as well as I ever had with eyes-the buzz haircut , brows that were long and wanted to curl , a small scar on his chin that he said came from an accident , ice skating . <p> He coughed once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started out one way , but that 's over now . Verbena ? I do n't have to go unless you tell me to . " <p> " Go , " I said . <p> But still he waited with the screen door half open ; he bent over to pat Hoot 's brindle head and by delaying give me one more chance . He whispered , " It 's all right , boy , " although nothing was . <p> I spun to the porch shelving , scrabbled clumsily among Daddy 's decoys , and grabbed a widgeon and a mallard , and I crammed one under each of his arms , thrust hard against his ribs . He grunted . <p> " Souvenirs , " I said . " Every time you look at them , Mr. Clement , remember that no sportsman shoots a duck that 's already landed on water . " <p> He was still poised on the step , arms pressing the decoys to his body , when I went to finish cooking my breakfast . Hoot , who had picked up confusing signals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After a while Andrew Clement carried my Daddy 's ducks away . <p> Bureaucracies move slow , so it was almost March before on an appointed morning I met Hugo Thornton at the Greene family cemetery . He was riding his backhoe and enjoyed being high above me , finally ; our teachers had kept moving him to the lowest front row for school photographs . He had covered his frizzy hair under a cap that advertised tractors , and he had his usual cigar , but not lit . <p> After shutting Hoot indoors so he would n't get hurt , I had arrived by an easy and thoughtful pace around the pond , crawled under barbwire , waded in dew across the pasture . I was carrying Daddy 's shotgun , more for show than genuine threat . I had cleaned and loaded it the night before , though I could not remember firing it since I was seventeen . <p> " Now , now , " Hugo said , waving that silly cap , " do n't point it , I 'm just sitting still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With power at my disposal . <p> No doubt he expected reinforcements . Somebody from the state capital . " You never had any backbone , Hugo . " <p> " Whatever I 've got , I 'd like to keep . " He kept his eye , not on me , but on the angle of the gun barrel while I seated myself on Mama 's headstone . She had died first , when I was thirteen . Cancer . Daddy took a midnight nap that lasted forever on a railroad track when I was in grade eleven . I had to start farming then . Over the years Hugo has offered me reams of credit-debt would have given him the upper hand-but I 've always paid cash or done without . <p> Feeling safer , Hugo climbed down and sat atop Daddy 's stone next door , his shoe poking the slightly sunken ground . " You use a vault , the grave wo n't drop like this . " <p> I shrugged , facing the Bellamys ' boundary , where treetops were just turning that early green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are expensive , though . Whatever you do , it 's still ashes to ashes , dust to dust . " He studied one toe as if death might have adhered to it . " It was losing your Daddy that made you leave school , was n't it ? " <p> " No . I finished most of senior year . Then I was needed on the farm . " <p> " Seems like yesterday , " said Hugo-wrong as usual . <p> We waited for whatever he was waiting for while he frowned at his watch again and tried to wind it . He said , " It 's good that you honor your people , uh , Verbena , but they 're not going to care if these graves get moved . It 's not as if they 're still here . They 've gone to heaven , right ? " <p> I was wondering what buckshot would do , not to his big machine , but to its tires . <p> " At least your mother 's there , for sure . But your daddy was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of those battery watches that do n't tick , and by will tried to make important cars come driving over my field . " I got to start soon . " <p> I walked to the gap where he had laid down two sections of the iron fence , stooped , and awkwardly propped them upright again to close us inside . As if on steppingstones I hopped back across my unborn siblings and collected the gun . I sighted down it , but at something far away . <p> " Come on , Verbena , " he begged . " Give it up . " <p> His cellphone rang . Hugo had to stay in touch with his many sidebusinesses ; he mowed rights-of-way for city and state , rented out farm equipment like this yellow backhoe , ran a two-bit landscaping business in addition to the feed-and-seed store he 'd inherited . He spat out the cigar . I heard him say , " Well , why not ? Of course she 's here . Armed . I said armed . How do I know that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crammed the phone into his pocket and scrambled up a ladder onto his machine like a fast monkey . Yellow headlights came on like baleful eyes , and the engine snarled . He shouted , " You 've had notice , Verbena Greene , " and drove with a jerk across the small and older graves of all the boys my Daddy would have loved better . <p> I leaped up . The gun fell . I jumped to block him off-just the move Hugo wanted . <p> He veered sharply aside and sank the bucket hard into the one patch of grass that must never be touched ; the cylinder nicked a low corner of the marker above Chester Evander Greene . I scrambled out of his way , yelling , No ! No ! No ! <p> At that angle , his bucket should have cut far too shallow a swath to touch Daddy 's casket , yet the red earth it lifted was carrying white shards of unmistakable bone . The boom stopped , swinging in midair . Fragments fell while Hugo turned off the noise and cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Verbena , just hold everything ! Good God ! " He jumped to earth and stared . Mouth open , fillings in view . Reached to touch , drew back . Bent to look down . Said to the grave more softly , " What the hell ? " <p> I left the gun alone . I did not move . <p> Very slowly Hugo said , " It looks like ? " He took off his cap and wiped his forehead on a tractor emblem . " It looks like your Daddy , uh , like he must 've come up through his coffin lid and . . . and rose . He 's right up here . High . " <p> Taking quick breaths , I sank onto Mama 's stone . Then I managed to wonder aloud if maybe such things did happen , after people had been buried a long time ? I had to raise my voice to be heard over his engine , so I asked again . <p> " From giving off gases and stuff ? Who knows ? " Hugo snorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbed his cap in midair , using the movements to help him count . " Twenty ? Twenty-five years . " I nodded . " This is , like , out of my line . " Hugo took a few steps back . " I do n't like it . I do n't like it a little bit . " <p> " Poor Daddy , " I said . <p> Suddenly he almost levitated into his roaring machine and upended the loose earth and clods , spilling the last white scraps into the slash from which they 'd come . To me he yelled , " There could be diseases and who knows what all . " I guess the Bellamys had used vaults . He began to manipulate the machine to repair the grave , back and forth , scraping gears , flattening the soil while I withdrew from the dust and noise . <p> It seemed to take a long time before he was satisfied , turned off the engine and just slumped in the seat . " I know they planted your Daddy deeper than that . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disturb the dead . " <p> " Yeah . and I 'm coined to tell them it ai n't worth the risk to mess in these graves . " He pointed vaguely west . " They can bring the road so close you 'll never have a peaceful funeral here again , but they can squeeze it on by if they have to . " <p> I told him there were no more Greenes to be buried here anyway , just me . <p> Desperate to keep him in town , I 'd once told Timothy Luce that I was carrying our child , but the lie did n't work . Instead he abruptly resigned and left in the night midway through my twelfth grade ; and nobody ever had a word or a letter from him . Even the station wagon loaded with his few possessions seemed to vanish into thin air . Or water . <p> " What makes you think , Hugo , that the state highway people will pay any attention to what you say ? " <p> " Because I 'm not the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already told them last fall to bypass your graveyard . I hear he quit his job over it . " <p> But asses have big ears so they can hear what 's not so . <p> He said , " Reseed this plot , get one good rain , you 'll never know it was bothered . " <p> I already knew that . <p> " Your Daddy can rest in peace . Not that he was ever all that peaceful while he lived . " I picked up Hugo 's dead cigar and threw it as far as I could , and I helped him reopen the iron fence . Then Hugo backed up his machine into a wide turn . It sat there , roaring . He motioned me to where he had crushed a wide space of honeysuckle , something else the government brought in . <p> I could barely hear him over the noise . " We kids always used to say-back in school , I mean-that Mr. Luce sort of made up for the good daddy you never got to have . " <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I broke the shotgun so he could see it had always been loaded . He probably did n't hear me say , " I still miss him . " <p>
