As you read this , avian flu is advancing toward America . Its prime targets include young men . It may be impossible to stop . But that does n't mean you ca n't be prepared A User 's Guide to the coming Plague <p> Lou Marion is under quarantine . It is n't an official health-department decree , but it might as well be : Ever since the boy 's parents and three of his six siblings became deathly ill , none of his neighbors in Butler , New Jersey , will step inside the infected home . At least the doctors visit daily . Unfortunately , the only advice they have for the 11-year-old is to swallow Epsom salts to " help keep his system clean . " See , Lou 's family has a touch of the flu . <p> The year is 1918 , and people throughout New Jersey are dying faster than carpenters can build caskets . As a result , all sorts of wooden boxes are being used for burial duty . And if a body does n't fit , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them inside . It 's different in Philadelphia . They 're way beyond boxes . With 11,000 deaths in the month of October alone , and the danger that the corpses will act as incubators for other communicable diseases , the city has resorted to digging mass graves with steam shovels . <p> This was " America versus Influenza " 87 years ago , at the height of World War I. By the time the virus burned itself out in 1919 , more than 500,000 people in the United States had died , making the Spanish flu more effective than the German army . Some victims died just days after being infected , probably as a result of a runaway immune reaction called a " cytokine storm , " while others lingered for weeks as secondary viral pneumonia ravaged their lungs . <p> " I do n't think anybody ever had that kind of flu before , " says Lou , nearly 98 now and , despite his failing eyes and ears , still sharp and spirited . " It was something entirely new , and people were shocked and bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " As we chat inside Lou 's retirement-community apartment  --  just a mile from where his family fought for their lives ( and won )  --  I do n't have the heart to tell him what I know : Despite nearly a century of scientific research , we may be no better prepared for a flu pandemic than when Epsom salts were our best defense . <p> Perhaps the best gauge of how worried we should be about a disease is whether terrorists would consider using it against us . If it is n't highly contagious , generally fatal , or both , al-Qaeda is n't going to bother trying to crop-dust a city with the stuff . That 's why a scan of the list of Priority Pathogens put out by the biodefense-research branch of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) is so disturbing : Right there , on the same page as " anthrax " and under " multi  --  drug-resistant TB , " is " influenza . " <p> Of course , the NIAID is n't referring to the A , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're used to ; those are viruses that infect the respiratory system and cause coughing , muscle aches , and maybe nausea , but not death in people with healthy immune systems . Rather , the experts are afraid of something that 's more on the order of the Spanish flu , a viral strain of influenza A that could make smallpox look like small potatoes . <p> " In our lifetime , we have not seen a disease sweep through a community and people die so fast that there 's no one to take care of them at the hospital and there 's no one to bury them , " says Greg Poland , M.D. , chief of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic college of medicine in Minnesota . " That 's what will happen in a pandemic . It would be more deaths than all the world 's wars in all of human history . All within the space of 6 to 18 months . " <p> You 'd think that if something this dangerous existed , it would be locked up in a lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way across Southeast Asia . Since 2003 , an avian influenza called H5N1 has killed at least 57 people and sickened twice as many in Vietnam , Thailand , Cambodia , and Indonesia combined . While those numbers may seem small , especially considering that approximately 36,000 Americans ( mostly elderly and children ) die of flu-related complications every year , they 're worrisome in context . Avian strains of influenza do n't normally infect humans , but this one has mutated and made the interspecies leap . What 's more , the influenza viruses behind the last two pandemics were of avian origin . <p> Yet another factor that has infectious-disease specialists scrambling is the toll H5N1 is taking on birds . There are basically two types of avian flu , as distinguished by their genetic makeup : " highly pathogenic " and " low pathogenic . " A high-path virus kills nearly all the poultry it infects , and has the potential to produce a similarly impressive body count in humans , should it make the jump . A low-path strain is much less virulent all around . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds , earning it the designation " high path . " <p> Indeed , the accumulated evidence paints such a dire pathogenic picture that , earlier this year , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) issued an urgent warning that a flu pandemic could affect billions of people worldwide . Billions because , unlike with our annual flu outbreaks , practically every single one of us will be vulnerable . <p> Think back to last year 's flu-vaccine shortage : Remember how health officials told us that only children and the elderly should stand in line for flu shots ? That was because they knew nearly everyone else 's immune system would be strong enough to weather an infection . Not so with H5N1 . If a high-path avian flu hits , we will all , in effect , be like the very young and the very old . <p> " In normal flu years , most of us have immunity , either from the vaccine or from having the flu in previous years , " explains Marc Lipsitch , Ph.D. , an associate professor of epidemiology , immunology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But in pandemics , we have no prior immunity , and it 's just like being hit with a completely new disease that we 've never built up any ability to fight . That 's why the mortality tends to be high even in the age groups that do n't usually get very sick from flu . " <p> Even athletic , twenty- and thirtysomething men will be susceptible , despite having what are arguably the most vigorous immune systems of all . " People basically  --  and particularly your readership  --  are highly likely to become infected and develop complications , possibly even die , " says Dr. Poland . " Why do I say that ? In 1918 , the people who more frequently died were in their teens to 40s . No one knows why . " <p> Witness what unfolded during the 1918-19 Stanley Cup finals . The championship series between the Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans had been tied at 2-2-1 when the NHL abruptly canceled game six . The reason : George Kennedy , the Canadiens ' manager , and five players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stricken with " La Grippe . " Hall , 37 , died 4 days after the cancellation , and the series was subsequently abandoned . <p> " The problem with influenza is that it 's really a bridesmaid disease , " says Scott Harper , M.D. , a medical officer with the flu team created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's National Center for Infectious Diseases . " It always gets lumped into the phrase ' cold and flu . ' " Young men , in particular , see the flu as nothing more than a severe case of the sniffles , he says . But while it 's rare for men in this demographic to die in a normal flu season , that 's not the case with H5N1 . " What we 're seeing in Vietnam is that young , healthy people are getting it and dying , " says Dr. Harper , adding that the current mortality rate is 50 percent . <p> I 'm sitting in Dr. Harper 's office at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta , though " office " is really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's high up on the door , a layout that could be used as a police-station interrogation room . Or , as I later find out , a holding pen for lab animals . <p> Dr. Harper , 39 , with a boyish face and slate blue eyes , joined the flu team a few years ago , soon after a stint battling another bug : Ebola . For 3 months , Dr. Harper went from hut to hut in villages across Uganda , searching for infected people  --  all while dodging rebel soldiers who would have killed him quicker than the virus . By the end of what turned out to be the largest recorded Ebola outbreak , 428 people had been infected , and nearly half of them had died . <p> One similarity between the Ebola virus and avian influenza ( aside from their capacity for carnage ) is that both diseases initially move from animal hosts to humans . So far , all the reported human cases of H5N1 have occurred in people who were in close proximity to domestic birds , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockfights . In order for the virus to become a pandemic strain , says Dr. Harper , it needs to spread quickly and easily from human to human . That has n't happened yet . But if there 's an " antigenic shift "  --  an abrupt and major change of the proteins inside the virus that results in a brand-new subtype  --  everything could change . <p> Such a shift could occur if a man who 's harboring human influenza simultaneously becomes infected with H5N1 . His lungs would then turn into a lab experiment in which the two viruses could " reassort , " meaning that a chunk of the genome from the human influenza would insert itself into the genome of the avian flu . The resulting Frankenflu would be a mutated strain of H5N1 now capable of spreading easily among humans . <p> " It 's purely contact time , " says Dr. Harper . " The more people who have an opportunity to be in contact with infected birds , the more opportunities two viruses have to get together . That 's what we 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit with a tour of the CDC buildings , including the Bio-safety Level 4 laboratory , where scientists handle highly infectious viruses like Marburg and Ebola , I begin to wonder whether " really worried " is government-speak for " totally screwed . " <p> " There are two ways we can dodge a pandemic : Destroy every H5N1-infected bird before the antigenic shift can occur , or develop a vaccine against the disease and inoculate everyone . Health officials in Southeast Asia have been trying the first approach since 1997 , cooking more chickens than KFC . But so far , the virus has managed to remain one carrier ahead of annihilation . <p> By comparison , the second strategy should be a cinch to pull off , considering that scientists already tailor each season 's flu vaccine to the human strain that 's most likely to strike . Their actual progress , however , has been slow  --  some critics say catastrophically so . <p> " Are we adequately prepared ? " asks Dr. Poland . " No . We do not yet have a vaccine ready to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be outraged that we waited and ignored the concerns and now people in every neighborhood were dying . " So just how far away are we ? In March of 2005 , the National Institutes of Health began clinical trials of an experimental H5N1 vaccine in 450 people . Researchers at three sites are vaccinating healthy men and women , ages 18 to 65 , and then administering a booster shot a month later . After that , blood samples will be taken and placed in test tubes , where they 'll be exposed to H5N1 . <p> " It 's called a neutralization test , and it generally reflects the presence of antibodies that can attach to the bird-flu virus and immobilize it , " says John Treanor , M.D. , the lead investigator of the trial at the University of Rochester . When a neutralization test was performed during this trial , the preliminary results showed that the vaccine produced a positive immune response . <p> Still , even if researchers hit the biological bull's-eye with the vaccine , it will be impossible to produce a supply large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part of the problem is that one of America 's three vaccine suppliers , Chiron , is still awaiting final FDA approval , because of its well-publicized contamination problems . And while the company could receive the okay at any time , the CDC is n't counting on it . <p> " Right now , we can make roughly 60 million doses domestically of a normal flu vaccine in a normal year , " says Lipsitch . " But according to recent research , the total amount of antigen required to immunize a person against H5N1 is four times as much as the total amount in a normal flu shot . In a pandemic , nearly everyone would need flu vaccines , but with the current version , we could immunize only 15 million Americans , just over 5 percent of the country . " <p> There is , however , a pandemic plan B : antiviral medications . Of the existing antivirals , one , oseltamivir phosphate , a.k.a . Tamiflu , has been shown to be effective against H5N1 . According to Arnold Monto , M.D. , a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used not only to treat and shorten the duration of H5N1 infections , but also to prevent the virus from spreading . <p> " Tamiflu inhibits the protein neuraminidase , which enables the virus to spread to other cells , " he says . " If the virus ca n't escape from its host cell , it ca n't spread to other people . " <p> It 's for this reason that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has advised certain countries to immediately start stockpiling Tamiflu . ( Fortunately , it has a 5-year shelf life . ) But here again , we 're lagging . While England has already ordered enough Tamiflu to treat 25 percent of its population , the United States has requested a mere 2.3 million treatments  --  sufficient for less than 1 percent of the country 's inhabitants . <p> " We 're way behind , " says Jeffrey Levi , Ph.D. , a senior policy advisor at the nonprofit organization Trust for America 's Health . " The United States can not come close to that 25 percent level . For us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to hope that the pandemic does n't strike before we 've ordered enough and received enough that it will provide some kind of protection . " <p> An additional order of 20 million treatments of Tamiflu has already been planned , and that number could still be adjusted upward . Unfortunately , as with the H5N1 vaccine , filling an America- size order could be problematic  --  there 's only one company , Roche , that makes Tamiflu , and the line to its door wraps around the world . Our best hope may turn out to be the Tamiflu that Roche is giving away : In a recent surprise announcement , the company said it would donate 3 million treatments to the WHO , so that if H5N1 erupts in Southeast Asia , the supply could immediately be flown to the region to try to stem the outbreak . Or at least slow it down . <p> " If we were to have a pandemic of H5N1 , it would be bad for 2 or 3 years , " says Dr. Harper . " But eventually , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become less dangerous and circulate in humans from year to year . " <p> Two or 3 years . With the near-certain shortage of vaccine and antivirals , surviving that period will depend on taking the same types of precautions used against another wildfire virus : SARS . " That would mean wearing masks and not shaking hands , " says Dr. Poland . " Mass gatherings would be canceled . School would be canceled . " And in such an atmosphere , adds Dr. Harper , the biggest challenge of all would be keeping our cool . " What we really do n't want to see is an epidemic of panic . " <p> There is , of course , the chance that this flu season will turn out to be more hype than horror . Nature , after all , is capricious . " It could be that we wake up in a few weeks and H5N1 is not the concern anymore , " says Dr. Harper . " It might be a whole different virus that surprises us . " MYTH <p> You can get the flu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sore arm , but that 's it . The flu shot is made from a killed virus , so it 's impossible for it to cause influenza , says Arnold Monto , M.D. , a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan . The vaccine does , however , take a few weeks to become effective , so if people get sick during that time , they assume it 's linked to their shot . MYTH <p> December is too late to get a flu shot . TRUTH <p> " It 's worth it to have the shot as late as January or February , " says Donald Beckstead , M.D. , a family physician in Pennsylvania . Traveling extends the flu season even further . " During our summer months , it 's the southern hemisphere 's flu season , " says Kristin Nichol , M.D. , chief of medicine at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center . MYTH <p> You can exercise to " sweat out " the flu . TRUTH <p> Pressing a barbell wo n't purify your body . Besides , if what you have is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping at a Gold 's Gym . Do n't exercise until the fever has subsided and your muscle aches are gone , says Dr. Beckstead . Doing so will only stress your body and prolong the infection . MYTH <p> The nasal-spray vaccine is less effective than the shot . TRUTH <p> What you spritz up your nose is as powerful as what they stick in your arm . The difference is that the spray contains a live virus that 's weakened , which means it can sicken people with poor immune systems . MYTH <p> A stomach flu is the same as the seasonal flu . TRUTH <p> " When people have that 24-hour bug where they throw up and have diarrhea , they call it the stomach flu , " says Dr. Beckstead . " But it 's not influenza ; it 's viral gastroenteritis . " So , while the flu shot wo n't protect you , drinking fluids might help boot out the bug . America Under Attacks <p> When the Spanish flu swept through U.S. cities in 1918 , it left behind five-digit death tolls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the country since , a new flu pandemic could kill millions coast to coast . If a pandemic hit the United States today . VACCINE AND ANTIVIRALS WOULD BE RATIONED . <p> Current supplies of both would protect less than 1 percent of me American population . <p> HOSPITALS MIGHT TURN AWAY PATIENTS . There 's expected to be a shortage of beds and respirators , as well as medically trained personnel , since doctors and nurses would also be out sick . <p> CORPSES WOULD PILE UP . " The mortuary service would not be able to handle the numbers of dead , " says Greg Poland , M.D. " There would be no place to take them . " <p> TRAVEL BANS AND QUARANTINES WOULD GO INTO EFFECT . Schools and offices would also likely be closed , and any nonessential large public gatherings would be canceled . <p> FOOD SHORTAGES COULD DEVELOP .

Flu antibodies left over from past infections try to attach to H5N1 but ca n't , because it 's new to humans .

Commuters <p> Men who take trains , subways , and buses will be at increased risk of contracting H5N1 . " Anytime people start coughing and sneezing close by , risk of transmission rises , " says Lamb . Dads <p> " Children are the major transmitters , " says Longini .
