Chapter One The Lincoln Tunnel is a scary place . Especially now , at the end of the workday . I 'm one link in an endless chain of drivers , all moving our cars through an atmosphere of one hundred percent pure carbon monoxide . Tunnel workers patrol walkways along the walls ; I assume they are there to make sure no car achieves a speed above three miles an hour . Their lungs must have a life expectancy of an hour and a half . Surrounding us all are thousands of tons of dirt and water , just waiting for a crack to come crashing through . I usually avoid this tunnel . It is one of three main passageways between New York City and Northern Jersey , where I live . I prefer the George Washington Bridge , where oxygen is plentiful and it does n't feel like I 'm driving through an enormous MRI machine . The fact is , I do n't come into New York that often , and when I do it 's rarely during the absurdly misnamed " rush " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law library to do some research for an appellate case I 'm handling , and I was stuck in court all day , so here I am . I have two choices . I can ponder my impending death by suffocation under all this mud and water , knowing my loved ones will forever wonder whether my final resting place was in New York or New Jersey . Or I can think about the case , and what my strategy will be if the Court of Appeals turns us down . I go with the case , but it 's a close call . My client is death row inmate Willie Miller , a twenty-eight-year-old African-American convicted of murdering a young woman named Denise McGregor in the alley behind the Teaneck , New Jersey , bar where he worked . It 's a case my father , Nelson Carpenter , prosecuted seven years ago , when he was the State District Attorney . Ironically , it 's also my father 's fault that I 'm on the case now . I think back almost two years to the day I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a frigid , windy , December Sunday , the kind of day that passing would be difficult , so each team would try to run the ball down each other 's throats . My father had come over to watch the game with me . He was never a big football fan , and my fanaticism about the Giants was clearly learned elsewhere . But he had been joining me to watch the games with increasing regularity since my mother died a year before . I do n't think it 's that he was liking football any more ; I just think he was liking loneliness even less . It must have been halftime that he brought it up , since if it were during the game I never would have heard him . " Do you remember the Willie Miller case ? " he asked . Of course I did . My father had sought and received the death penalty ; this was not something I was likely to forget . " Sure . What about it ? " He told me that some information had recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , or even what the specific information was , but he said that he had learned that a juror lied in voir dire , a significant lie that could result in a new trial if revealed to the court . He was grappling with what to do with the information , since revealing the specifics would amount to breaking a privilege . Yet as an officer of the court he felt uncomfortable with concealing it , since Willie Miller was entitled to have the truth come out . " How would you feel about representing him on an appeal ? " " Me ? " I 'm sure my mouth was stuffed with potato chips , so it probably came out " Mnnpphh ? " " Yes . You could have an investigator look into it , find out the facts without me having to tell you , and then go to the appeals court . " The case , as I remembered it , was open-and-shut . Willie Miller , even when seen through my skeptical defense attorney 's eyes , was a murderer . I was not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if it succeeded ? I 'd have to go through a trial I was bound to lose . " No thanks . " " It would be important to me . " There it was , the sentence from which there was no defense . In my family , when you asked a favor of someone , it was acceptable to refuse . But once the person said that it was important to them , it crossed a line and became an absolute imperative . We did not use those words frivolously , and they carried an awesome weight . " Then I 'll do it . " " You 've got no chance , you know . " I laughed . " Then why the hell is it so important to you that I enter the swamp ? " That is how we referred to legal cases that dragged on forever with little or no chance of ultimate victory . " Because the man is on death row . " The Giants kicked off to start the second half , the Redskins drove the length of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might well leave me forever stuck in the Lincoln Tunnel . But , no ! Suddenly , without warning , a burst of speed by the cars ahead lets me gun the accelerator to almost five miles an hour . At this rate , there 's a chance I might make it home in time to leave for court tomorrow morning . ( Continues ... )
