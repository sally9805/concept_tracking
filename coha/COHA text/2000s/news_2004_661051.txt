<p> If you 've ever been camping you know how nice it is to have a campfire at night . It keeps you warm , cooks your food , and gives light so you do n't trip over anything . Fire was the earliest source of light for humans , and for centuries fire in different forms lighted the way . <p> While the cooking fire also lighted their dwellings , people soon learned to make a portable light source , a torch . The first torches were probably sticks tied together and lighted on one end . Later , people learned to soak rags in oil ( vegetable oil or animal fat - petroleum was n't widely used until the 1860s ) and tie them to the end of the stick to make a longer-lasting light source . The oil soaked into the rag through a process called capillary action , where a liquid seeps into the tiny spaces in fiber or thread . This action proved very useful in the next big development in making light - the wick . <p> Around 70,000 BC , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks or shells filled with moss or something else that soaked up animal fat . As people developed pottery , they created lamps with a bowl and a spout . The oil was held in the bowl while a wick placed in the spout drew - through capillary action - oil along the spout where it burned . While most of the flame came from the burning oil , the wick gradually burned as well . Lamps were often made of clay or bronze , but sometimes were made of gold , silver , glass , or stone . Handles were soon added to make them easier to carry . Lids were added to keep the oil clean . <p> The next great lighting improvement came with the development of the candle . Light on a string has long been used in Africa , where oily nuts were strung on twigs and burned to make light . Around 3000 BC the Phoenicians and Etruscans began using wax candles , coating the string with tallow ( animal and vegetable fat ) to form a cylinder . Capillary action works even uphill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the candle toward the flame . <p> Beeswax candles became an important source of light in the Middle Ages . Oil lamps tended to be smoky and could quickly make lighting a room unpleasant . Beeswax candles were expensive , though , so families often relied on the cooking fire to light their homes . <p> The early Chinese and Japanese got their candle wax from insects and seeds . In India , candles used in temples were made from wax skimmed from boiling cinnamon . The earliest " candles " in North America were used by native Americans during the first century . An oily fish was wedged into a forked stick and ignited . American colonists discovered that a sweet-smelling candle wax could be made by boiling the berries of bayberry bushes . It was a tedious process , however , as it takes 1-1/2 quarts of bayberries to make a candle . <p> During the 18th century , Swiss chemist Francois-Pierre Ami Argand made a number of improvements to the oil lamp . In 1783 he created a hollow wick that provided more air for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder that worked as a chimney to improve the airflow outside the flame . The increased flow of oxygen made the flame burn more brightly . He also invented a way to raise and lower the wick to change the size of the flame . The Argand lamp holds a special place in the history of education . Can you guess why ? It produced enough light for people to be able read at night . This brought many opportunities for those who had to work all day but still wanted to learn . <p> The next major step in lighting was gaslight , which burned manufactured natural gas instead of oil . Some of the first gaslights were installed in 1806 in a cotton mill in Manchester , England . By 1830 , thousands of gas lamps were in use in London . Moving carriages , including those in the London Underground , carried a gas supply in bags on the roof . Gas produced a more even light than candles or oil lamps , but they had a tendency to explode when not handled carefully . Inventors kept looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English chemist Humphrey Davy created the first arc lamp . He used a powerful battery to " jump " a current across two charcoal strips held slightly apart . The current produced a bright light that eventually consumed the charcoal strips . Arc lamps are bright - too bright , in fact . Women hid behind their umbrellas to avoid them . Too bright for indoor use , they were a good source of street lighting well into the 20th century . <p> Most modern lighting evolved from the incandescent bulb , which finally did away with open flame , smoke , and burning gases . The problem that challenged most inventors during the 1800s was to find a practical material for the filament - the small thread that glows as electricity goes through it . Both Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan , a Briton , created bulbs with carbon filaments in 1879 . They lasted only a few hours . Edison came up with bamboo filaments in 1880 that lasted up to 1,200 hours . <p> Other lamps were also being developed that used a glowing , not burning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georges Claude applied an electrical discharge to a tube filled with neon gas to produce light . In 1923 , his company sold two neon lights reading " Packard " to a car dealership in Los Angeles . People called the early signs " liquid fire , " and neon lights quickly became popular throughout the United States . Fluorescent lights , introduced at the New York World 's Fair in 1938 , were first called mercury vapor lamps . Many now use argon gas . <p> While many inventors worked to improve how we light up a room , others wanted to amplify or focus the light in specific directions . <p> Two Englishmen , Goldsworthy Gurney and Thomas Drummond , are jointly credited in the 1820s with discovering that burning quicklime produces a brilliant light . In 1826 this type of light , combined with a curved reflector , sent a signal that was seen 95 miles away . This focused " limelight " quickly became a popular lighting method in theaters , coining the phrase " in the limelight . " Gurney also intensified the light from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame . He used this " Bude light " ( named for the seaside town where he lived ) to light his entire castle by using prisms and mirrors to distribute the light into every room . <p> A more intense form of light was still to come , however . In 1960 , American physicist Theodore Maiman built the first laser . ( The name stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation . ) Lasers use energy and reflectors to intensify light into an intense beam that can travel long distances without dispersing or scattering . Lasers can cut through diamonds and bounce off the moon and return to earth . They also " play " your DVD . <p> But for all the modern developments in light , nothing beats the reassurance of burning wood when you 're spending the night at a campground . <p> Seeking the ' why ? ' of light <p> Scientists and inventors have long tried to understand the principles behind light and how it 's produced . One theory that was popular for almost a century was the " phlogiston " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physician Georg Ernst Stahl proposed that all flammable objects contain phlogiston ( floh JIHS tuhn ) . As objects burned , the phlogiston was given off . Air absorbed the phlogiston , which is why ( according to the theory ) fire needs air . <p> Plants remove phlogiston from the air , which is why they burn when dried . Eighteenth-century English chemist Joseph Priestley called oxygen " dephlogisticated air " because it " absorbed " great quantities of phlogiston . ( Can you see how he might think that oxygen was " absorbing " lots of phlogiston ? Pure oxygen makes a fire burn rapidly . ) <p> In the late 1700s , French chemist Antoine Lavoisier began to study combustion . He carefully measured the weight of objects and air involved in the burning process . Based on his findings , he proposed a new theory of combustion and renamed dephlogisticated air " oxygen . " Lavoisier helped explain the process of burning , but more study was needed to explain how light is made . <p> Modern theories explain light in terms of photons , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extra energy is supplied by the heat or electricity applied to create the light . <p> Scientists admit they do n't fully understand everything about light . So who knows ? We may hear some different theories next . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
