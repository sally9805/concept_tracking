For nearly 60 years , sharing the universe has been his mission . // Looking for stars at the Griffith Observatory can be confusing . True , spotting stars is what observatories do , of course , but this is Los Angeles . The Hollywood sign is clearly visible on the hills off the east . Some people in this town keep track of movie stars they 've seen like Audubon society members list birds . On this warm Saturday in September , however , the star of the day was clearly John Dobson , astronomer to the world , whose 85th birthday was being celebrated on the observatory 's front lawn , a party that has become a popular annual event . The Sidewalk Astronomers , a unique street-corner observing club of which Dobson is both a founding member and philosophical leader , threw the birthday bash and , in their characteristically egalitarian way , invited everyone to come . It did n't matter if you knew the guest of honor or not . The party was just the way Dobson wants the world of astronomy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The telescopes he designed and that bear his name reflect the same philosophy - available to anyone who is interested , made easily from inexpensive materials with help and encouragement cheerfully provided by other astronomers . Photograph John Dobson often celebrates his birthday with guests at an open party hosted by the Los Angeles Sidewalk Astronomers at Griffith Observatory . // The birthday party happily included tourists with cameras , parents with babies in strollers , teenagers in baggy pants , and astronomers of all types . They strolled past an array of Dobsonian telescopes displayed in the grass and chatted with astronomers polishing lenses and building telescope mounts under awnings set up to provide a little shade . The idea was clear : out with the mystic of telescopes and fancy equipment , and in with the mysteries of the universe . Dobson , the birthday boy himself , was busy pointing out another star . " Come and see the sun , " he called out to anyone within earshot . His style is a cross between an evangelical missionary and a Bourbon Street barker . Standing by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of onlookers . The children , especially , were obviously dying to find out what was going on , but warily eyed the thin , shirtless man with the gray ponytail , who invited them to step up to the odd contraption and take a look . A few of the braver ones came forward , strained to see through the eyepiece , and became hooked . " That dark spot you see , that 's a sun spot - I call it a magnetohydrodynamic zit , " said Dobson to one puzzled young man . " Can you see it ? It 's near the edge of the sun . That spot is the size of Earth . The sun is a basketball , Earth a grape seed . That 's what the rest of the world looks like . " " That black spot ? " said the teenager , still unsure about what he was seeing . " That spot is not black : " explained Dobson . " It is brighter than a welder 's arc . See Saturn silhouetted against the sun , then you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobson , the party was clearly just an excuse to do what he likes to do best : Get people - young , old , everyone - to take a look at the universe . " People are born into a universe , " says Dobson , " not just Earth . We owe them the right to see where they 're born . Most people know nothing about the universe . We make telescopes so that people can see that there is something to be understood , " he says . " If they do n't see , they do n't understand . " So how many people have been exposed to this Johnny Appleseed of astronomy ? " I meet about 100,000 people a year , " he says . " But often its in the middle of the night , so I do n't know what they look like . I 've been doing this for 30 years . I 've probably gotten several million people to look through a telescope . " If Dobson has his way , several million more will have the chance before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . Dobson and his friends spent the evening before the birthday party outside at Burbank Mall until 10 PM . " Then cool air came in , but you could still see the moon . Astronomers in general are allergic to the moon , but not everybody has seen the moon . " " There are private star parties , but we do this . You have to go where the people are - national parks and shopping malls . " Dobson 's journey to the California shopping mall started in Beijing , China , where he was born on September 14 , 1915 . His father was then teaching zoology at Beijing University . The Dobson family , including John and his three brothers , moved to the United States in 1927 . They had intended San Francisco to be only a brief layover , but ended up staying there . After mostly home schooling , Dobson enrolled at the University of California , Berkeley , in 1934 . It took him until 1943 to be graduated , however , due to his broad range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after spending plenty of time on educational digressions . A year later in 1944 , he became a monk in a Vedanta monastery , part of the Ramakrishna religious order . At the monastery , he kept to a strict routine that began at about 5 A.M. each day and continued with meditation , worship , and study . Even while in the monastery , Dobson pursued his efforts to understand the universe . He began to make telescopes to capture a better look at the objects of the night . By 1956 Dobson made the first of a type of telescope that will probably always carry his name - to his chagrin . ( He called the invention a " sidewalk telescope . " ) Photograph Dobson checks the view through a solar telescope , determined to share good sunspots and flares with his guests . Photograph // He found a 12-inch porthole glass and asked if he could use it to make a telescope . When he finished building the scope , he used it to take a good look at the moon , and he very much liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning a telescope meant you must share it with everyone who wants to see the sky - and even with some who do n't know that they do . He remained with one monastery or another for 22 years , leaving only to devote himself to learning and sharing the sky . He would sometimes leave the monastery late at night and wander the streets , looking for innocent bystanders who might want to look at the sky through his scope . Dobson began making telescopes for others early in his monastic career , using mostly found materials . Eventually he built and gave away many telescopes . But by then , the monastery leadership had become frustrated with his absences and outside interests . Dobson was faced with expulsion and though he wanted to stay in the brotherhood , he could n't part with his telescope passion and was finally asked to leave . By 1968 , Dobson and other Bay Area amateurs started the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers . Its reason for existing was to share the sky with the public . Members went everywhere - to street corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they set up telescopes and invited bystanders to take a look . At first , serious amateur astronomers criticized Dobson 's telescope design . Some claimed that his building and testing techniques would be useless to serious amateur astronomers . These folks missed that Dobson wanted to make a big scope that almost everyone could use . Astronomy magazine 's long-time editor , Richard Berry , is credited with coining the term Dobsonian telescope and popularizing Dobson 's work in Telescope Making magazine and in Astronomy , when it first appeared in 1973 . Today , Dobsonian telescopes are common at all star parties . Some set aside a field just for Dob users . No longer , however , is every Dobsonian made at home . Many entrepreneurs have taken the Dobson idea and perfected it for sale . ( Look for " Running with the Big Dobs " in this issue on page tk . ) Late in the afternoon of Dobson 's 85th birthday party , Astronomy photographer Raleigh Souther called out that it was time for pictures . Dobson reluctantly put on his shirt and allowed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's steps with a crowd of well-wishers . The conversation , however , never actually stopped . " Do we have a psychological connection to the sky ? " a college teacher asked . " Ump , " said Dobson . " We look , we find these lovely things . " You need to wonder . What 's the use of someone who does n't wonder ? " " We saw you in New Mexico in 1998 , " said one middle-aged man with his wife , " in Albuquerque . " " I remember that we made a sun telescope to raffle off , " replied Dobson , " and the woman who bought the first ticket , won . She cried when we told her it was hers . " When the formal pictures were over , the crowd members brought out their own cameras . " Mr. Dobson , " said a handsome young man with his girlfriend standing shyly behind him . " My name is Eric . I just wanted to say Happy Birthday , and , may I take your picture ? " Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of a Dobsonian telescope , it was decorated with the words " Happy Birthday " and " nothing does n't exist " - a Dobson theme - written in icing . " I 'm allergic to the Big Bang , " he said . While someone cut the cake , Dobson found a bit of shade and ate a bowl of fruit . He will certainly create a whole new batch of sky watchers wherever he goes . Before he 's done , he will probably reach another million willing students .

That was the year that I spent wandering the paths of London 's lonely underbelly . At the time I shared a two-bedroom council flat with Fafi , another musician like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a mbira player , had arrived in London with ambitions , hoping to make his big break in world music . Then he met some ethnomusicologist who lured him into academic-conference-type gigs at some university . Fafi 's expectations swelled and he , simpleton that he was then , took the gigs for a sure path to commercial success . But London , with its ways of picking large holes through one 's pockets , called his bluff and the money from the occasional gig started spouting out of his pocket irreplaceably fast . As with many new Londoners , his ambitions wound up in that wasteland that 's littered with wreckages of that sort . He abandoned music and did what every migrant does best : throwing oneself into juggling two or three low paying jobs , hoping to save money and buy a house or some such symbol of success back home . By the time I arrived in London he was a security guard during the day and a burger flipper by night . I never saw much of him and my initiation into London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home after midnight and left at six . But once I got a job , I stopped staying up late , waiting for him to get back home . After that we hardly saw each other ; I would get up at seven , when he was long gone , take a twenty minute walk to my workplace , the second-hand furniture shop on our high street . I would spend the day lifting furniture that people either came to buy or flog off to the shop . Thankfully Tony , the shop owner , was quick with his valuations ; from the depths of a swathe of cigarette smoke and with the practiced sidelong glance of an old hand , he routinely turned down items from speculative sellers . That saved us lifting a lot of rubbish out of people 's vans , except for one piece of furniture  --  the old piano that I latched onto after Tony had laughed it off . That would later provide me with relief when my tongue went cold and stiff . </P> At five-thirty I would head home , walking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already in bed , I would hear him clanking things in the kitchen . I would fall asleep . When I woke up in the morning he would be gone . I 'd make my way to the furniture shop . </P> At the end of the day I would head home , via the park again . At night Fafi would roll in ; I would hear the sound of his urine jet hitting the water in the WC . Then I would fall asleep . Days flashed by , Fafi became a distant memory . That 's when I felt the cold finger of . a kind of ennui tenderly stroking me . I sprang to my feet and sought the warmth of Londoners . London was still as nebulous a thing as ever to me , yet in the evenings the longing for the familiar company of musicians drove me to the east end of the city . But , throwing off the odd stink of desperation that usually sends men and mice scattering for their holes , I could n't bring myself to step into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . </P> When , after days of hesitation , I gathered courage , I ventured into the Rhythm Factory . Putting on a cabaret show there was a collective of musicians , poets and animators  --  the kindred spirits that are always found huddled together on the fringes of any big city , furiously scribbling staggering verses of poetry and heaps of music-chord progressions , all on the strength of a single meal a day . But their show was packed tight with a jumble of references to obscure iconoclasts of British television , film and music . The whole thing slipped clean off my grasp and I walked off to an arts cafe bar nearby . There I met a hard-to-figure-out lesbian barmaid who , in my subsequent visits would touch me in a manner for which I could n't find the words to touch back . About twenty-two , with an immense Afro hairstyle , a mechanic 's cap , low slung jeans and pointedly displayed big knickers , she came across as a hardened thing . At least that 's what I thought at first . But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conversation I thought maybe it was n't her looks that I found striking but her nose for a loner . When I went there again I saw her observing me as I sat at my table . Then her girlfriend came , they kissed flauntingly , walked out and left everyone mildly amused . The next time I went there , having ordered a coffee , I was handing her the money for the drink but , smiling conspiratorially , she waved me away and turned to serve another customer in the queue . Three more times this happened . After that , maybe she sensed my discomfort and tried to keep her distance . Later , a part of me wanted to get to the bottom of all this , but now she was making herself too busy to talk . When I finally caught up with her , I discovered that I had not ordered my thoughts and rather than risk things coming out the wrong way I said nothing but ordered another coffee . Again she smiled , waved my money away and turned to serve another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity , I stopped going to the cafe-bar and started spending evenings in my room , playing the piano that I had got for nothing at the furniture shop . </P> Over the following week , on the way to work , I began to notice this dried prune-face old woman at the corner of our block . Possibly a grandmother from Africa ; her resemblance to Bi Kidude , the legendary Zanzibari songster , sharp as a clutch of knives . Every morning she splashed water and scrubbed the pavement outside her house  --  a twitchy touch here and there , a flourish of careless strokes every once in a while . Each time as I came close , her figure would unfold like a penknife and she would stand erect , sharp and indifferent , waiting for me to pass before throwing herself at her task again . Sometimes our eyes met , but hers quickly glazing over , hardening in a single blink . </P> A few weeks later , while walking through the park , I bumped into her . It was not so much the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her manner of walking . She walked at a brisk pace , as if pursued by invisible assailants . You got that impression that the moment she turned her back to the tropical sunshine , long shadows fell on her path and whatever it was that had pursued her to this part of the world , she was trying in her own way to outpace it . From the beginning of the week , her pavement cleaning was also getting noticeably more frenzied by the day . Although , on seeing me approach , she still straightened up and waited for me to pass , she was increasingly impatient , clipping my heel with her brush as I stepped past until , on our last encounter I had to leap out of the way . After watching her vanish into the distance in the park , I went home and played Abdullah Ibrahim numbers on the piano . The Pilgrim . Mannenberg . Tshisa . </P> Then I lost my job and everything changed . I forgot this old woman , stopped thinking about that girl at the cafe-bar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bed staring at the London sky through my window . On some nights it shuddered over London like a gigantic kite on the end of a string whose end was tangled up in my Bi Kidude 's feet as she paced through the park . On some nights , when that happened , satellites way up in the sky trembled and threw off digital dust down to earth ; a text message would land on my mobile phone and I would think the impossible  --  hoping that it was a message from that girl at the cafe-bar that hindsight now imbued with a harmless and clearly sisterly charm . And then one moonlit night I felt my tongue slowly getting gnarled inside my mouth . For three nights I stood in front of the mirror and tried to talk to myself but , conditioned to associate that with madness , I remained speechless . On the fourth night I waited until Fafi was back , hoping to chat and catch up . When he arrived , tired , he went straight to bed . I waited for him again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it clear that I was barking up the wrong tree . I gave up . </P> As days flew by , a hideous normality hung over our road  --  people walking about on our road as if all was okay . Walking people being hard to talk to , unlike the seated , I simply watched them saunter past our window all day . In London where no one ever sits down except on the tube or bus , where talking to a stranger is a clear sign of madness , I took my stiff tongue to that girl at the cafe bar . </P> Four nights in that week I , looked for her , four times there was no sign of her . After a fifth attempt , I went home and sat down at my piano . She had probably found a job elsewhere . At the end of that week , Fafi left for Zimbabwe because of his brother 's illness ; my isolation was absolute . </P> Where the juddering riff of anxiety finally delivers its victims is never predictable , but one day , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start getting up early just as I used to when I still was employed , take a walk down the familiar route to work , pretend I still had a job . </P> Monday morning : Bi Kidude is still there , scrubbing the pavement . It 's a small patch that she scrubs ; the four panels right outside the gate , but her manner is now one of bare knuckled determination , a will to wrest back control ; as if having lost her place in the world and overwhelmed by this feeling of loss , she is now determined that there shall be at least a patch of earth over which she has complete dominion . When I decide to take my stiff tongue to her the following week , she is nowhere to be seen , outside her home or in the park . </P> Thursday evening is just as luckless , but on Friday evening a desire to disentangle myself from this deathly grip stirs inside me . I take my last 20 pounds and head for the local pub . There I get drunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undo a torsion bar . At the first sign of success , it springs out of control and tosses a snatch of unintended words into the air . Fists fly and before I know it Fm in the back of a police van protesting my innocence , trying to explain to the police officers that I only had one pint of beer . </P> The police cell was n't that bad , but not having thrown the first punch , I felt a little aggrieved in the morning . The police , more concerned about my immigration status , accompanied me to our flat to inspect my immigration papers . Once inside my room , somewhere in between the peaks and troughs of a delicately thundering hangover , I felt my tongue loosen up a little . I went straight for the piano and there I stumbled upon a new dialect . " It 's called A Rigor Mortis of the Tongue &; Other Earthly Things , " I said to the two bemused cops . They said nothing throughout the song , applauded cheerfully but patronizingly at the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They flicked through it and , satisfied , were about to leave when oneof them turned round and said , " Just how big was that one pint that you had , mate ? " </P>
