From pre-liturgy gabbing to bare midriffs to Cheerios strewn all over the floor , some of our fellow worshipers could take a lesson from Emily Post . // " WHAT 'S THE BUZZ ? " MAY BE A FINE AND feisty 21st-century greeting , but it 's also a question you can often hear old-time Catholics-those who were trained in proper church etiquette in ancient days by black-habited nuns-whisper to each other as they enter church on Sunday morning . " That buzz " - and you do n't have to listen closely to identify it-is the sound of unrestrained conversation among already-seated churchgoers as they wait for Mass to begin . It usually stops or is drowned out by the organ as soon as the procession starts . But that 's not the way it used to be when folks waited , often on their knees , in respectful silence for the beginning of the Holy Sacrifice . That buzz , that new buzz , is annoying . We seem to have lost the sense of solemnity , the holy hush of anticipation that used to wash quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to God then , were n't we ? Should n't we still be doing that ? Some outspoken grandparent-aged critics blame it on the loss of Latin , for starters . But I think the change is more likely a sign of the unconscious drift into a more casual age that seems to be the mode of society overall . We have n't yet learned , however , that casual is not synonymous with careless , which is the direction in which many folks have turned in our post-Emily Post world . It is certainly more comfortable not to have to be starch-stiff just because everybody is supposed to dress up on Sundays . You rarely even see an Easter Parade anymore on that Sunday , let alone buy a special flower-brimmed bonnet to be worn to church for the first time along with a special Easter outfit . But deep down , in the lingering accepted custom , dressing up just a bit for churchgoing on any Sunday is basically a matter of respect . Those of us who belong to the old fogey faction believe that and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ready for the beach or a walk in the woods , even in a downtown parish . That currently fashionable bare-skin gap between blouse and jeans really does n't seem respectfully proper for church , not even on early grade-schoolers or teenagers . Nor , alas , does the miniskirt . It seems at least sensible that anyone wearing a mini should really decline the assignment to carry up the offertory gifts . That has to be a distraction , at least for the middle-aislers . And some prudish parish folks will talk about it . If I have heard it once , I have heard it said dozens of times : The reason there are no " official " comments on proper dress made from the altar or featured in the church bulletin is that it is better to have people attend , no matter how inappropriately garbed , than not be in church at all . " The Lord does n't care what you wear " is often said in defense of scruffiness or unsuitability . But you can note in reading the gospels that Jesus was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount such rules as in , for instance , the parable of the guest without a wedding garment ( Matt. 22:11 ) . IT IS NOW OFTEN REQUESTED IN CHURCH THAT CELL PHONES , pagers , and video games be turned off when Mass is about to begin , which is perfectly reasonable . There are also some Sundays when " It is time to turn off the children now , too " could be a welcome addition to the silence suggestions . There is nothing sweeter and more moving than the sight of a young family praying together . " Let the little children come to me , " ( Mark 10:14 ) is a profound admonition from Jesus himself . But few of us , except for beamingly clueless ( and deaf ? ) parents , believe that unrestrained screaming or brotherly punch-outs should be a part of the eucharistie ceremony . Kids really do need a bit of training for church attendance . It is difficult to keep your attention focused on the altar when there is a loudly discordant , unmuffled baby babbling right in your ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated on a kneeler happily kicking the soles of your shoes as you kneel in the pew ahead . It can be very distracting to observe a parent playing tic-tac-toe or some ball-bouncing game with a child in a pew nearby . Doing a complete rebraiding of a 10-year-old 's elbow-length tresses or letting a preteen examine the contents of her mother 's purse , lipstick by lipstick , is annoying for anyone within visual range . Letting an eager child practice reading aloud from just any book during any part of the Mass is an annoyance of some magnitude . And why is a cutesy kiddie book on toilet training suitable for church ? There are plenty of religiously themed children 's books available . In fact , I have sometimes wondered why a collection of such helps for small congregants is n't made available in cry rooms , if not in regular pews . WE ALL MAKE BEHAVIORAL SLIPS IN CHURCH , I SUPPOSE . But in a special way the church should feel like home . The parish church is home on the bridge between time and eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager explain that he or she is doing something irritating because at home you should be able to " be yourself " ? Then , have you ever seen someone applying hand lotion during Mass ? Or giving a back rub ? Fascinating and eye-popping to be sure , but out of sync with time and place . Gum chewing may be quiet , but it 's ugly to see , especially when done open-mouthed . It 's fine , and even wise , to bring a soothing small bottle of milk or juice for a small restless person . But serving candy or crackly cereal snacks is a bit over the line . And it would be better if folks wrote their collection checks before arriving at church . I must look like an easy lender , but I do n't always have a pen handy with me for the last-minute giver to borrow . And while not all homilies are fantastic , it really must be disconcerting for a priest to see congregants sitting right there in an up-front pew reading the bulletin while he preaches . Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to jot down and drop in the collection baskets , or some designated receptacle , just one way in which each feels a lack of respect is being displayed in church ? Then some of us-all of us-might learn a lot . Sidebar Advance copies of Sounding Board are mailed to a sample of U.S. CATHOLIC subscribers .
