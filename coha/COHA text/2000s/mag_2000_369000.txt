At M.I.T. , Ray Kurzweil acquired the nickname the Phantom because he tended to skip class to work on his inventions . His disappearing act paid off . Earlier this year President Clinton presented the native New Yorker , 52 , with the National Medal of Technology  --  a sort of cyber-Nobel Prize . Kurzweil 's eclectic career and propensity for combining science with practical  --  often humanitarian  --  applications have inspired comparisons with Thomas Edison . <P> The comparison is n't that farfetched . By age 16 , Kurzweil had built his first computer and sold software to IBM . His first major breakthrough , the Kurzweil Reading Machine , allowed blind people to read any document by simply feeding pages into an optical scanner that recognized characters . The computer then " spoke " the words aloud . In 1982 , at the urging of Stevie Wonder , Kurzweil built what became the first synthesizer able to reproduce rich , orchestral sounds accurately ; it is now widely used by pop musicians . <P> The son of a music professor and an artist , Kurzweil appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got a Secret ( on which comedian Henry Morgan guessed Kurzweil 's " secret " device  --  one that could write original music based on music it had " heard " ) . In college Kurzweil played piano , wrote poetry and studied creative writing with Lillian Hellman . <P> Though renowned philosophy professor John R. Searle has called some of Kurzweil 's visions " preposterous , " several of his predictions about cyberdevelopments of the 1990s  --  Does a computer beating a world chess champion sound familiar ?  --  have proved dead on . <P>  --  By Harriet Barovick
