Chapter Nine To venture into enemy territory , that was how Doron thought of it at first . He located the Hajimi house through police records at the Russian Compound , where Hassan Hajimi was imprisoned . It was like a research project : First , Raad 's books at the library . Then some treatises on Islam , and books of Muhammad 's sayings . Now this . As he flipped through the long document which listed former as well as current prisoners Doron began to wonder who all these political prisoners were . The sergeant on duty watched him with folded arms . Doron was in civilian clothes : black jeans , a white tee shirt . " Here it is , " Doron said to the sergeant , because the man seemed to require communication . Doron jotted the address down on a matchbook . He nodded at the sergeant , whose eyes flickered over Doron 's face . He raised two skeptical eyebrows and quickly came over and took the heavy notebook from Doron . Doron walked down through Musrara and across King David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man with a mission . He was looking for a new wardrobe . He wound his way to Jaffa Gate and the souk , and began descending the main thoroughfare . He tried not to look out of place , but he felt huge and awkward and surrounded . He zigzagged through the crowds down to the bottom of the tourist market , past stalls selling tee shirts , chess sets , ceramics , candles and candelabras , round leather ottomans , silver jewelry , and gilt-sheathed daggers , and then turned left and headed toward Damascus Gate and the real market , where they sold things people needed . The place was crowded ; Doron was certain he was the only Israeli here if you were Israeli , you stayed well within the Jewish Quarter in the Old City unless you were looking for a fight . He passed through the food market . Imploring wide-socketed skulls of butchered animals hung at waist height . Goats and cattle , possibly sheep , Doron could n't tell . Behind the exotic aromas of cumin and coriander from the spice market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alley were slick and black with water and bloody runoff from the butcher stalls . Women with shopping baskets and bags engaged in a cacophony of negotiation with the stall keepers . Bright oranges and lemons lit up the dark alleyways . He turned down a narrow roofed alleyway and emerged from a world of skinned chickens into aisles piled with pants , stacked with scarves , festooned with hanging dresses , leggings , and children 's clothes . Eager faces looked out at him from the stalls . It was less crowded here . If he spoke Hebrew no , he did n't even want to think about that . But if he spoke Arabic , his accent would give him away , he was sure . So , English maybe they would not be able to detect his accent in a foreign language . " Pants , " he said to a smiling man . " Pants ? " the man asked . Doron pointed at the stack . " Ah , trousers , " the man said . " Yes , for me , " Doron said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of black polyester pants with a sharp crease down the front . " You like ? " he asked . " Yes , " Doron said . He was assembling his disguise . He felt the excitement of adventure . Dress-up . The man started wrapping the folded pants , and looked sideways up at Doron . Doron caught the look , and understood : Why was this foreigner buying these things ? It did n't make sense . Should he get a keffiyeh ? They were hanging from a rack a few stalls down . Too obvious , he thought . And not everyone wears them . And could he ever figure out how to wrap one ? Never . He settled on a scarf , a long woolen one . Palestinian men tied them around their necks with the two ends hanging down in front . Guaranteed to look authentic , Doron thought , as he put the scarf in his little black plastic bag along with the pants . Now a close-fitting knitted hat and a sweater-vest , and I 'm ready . He took everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , shoving his real clothes into the back of a closet . He did n't want to think too much about what he was doing . This would be normal , he thought , if I were doing it for the army , for some undercover unit , for some good reason . The greatest generals always had some story of dressing up like women and assassinating terrorists in distant Arab cities . But for him , there was no good reason . He was doing this simply because he felt compelled . He needed to know more ; so far , he could explain nothing to himself . Not the boy 's death , not the mother 's strange allure , not his own involvement . If he got closer , maybe he 'd see things more clearly . And maybe not . But he had to try . He wanted more than anything to see Marina Raad again . He wondered : Was this normal ? In any way ? He turned her over in his mind . The black hair , the way it curled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard to keep distant and haughty . When he looked in the mirror , he thought he 'd done a pretty good job . He wondered if Palestinians had a different way of walking ; he thought so . Israelis moved aggressively ; the Palestinians were more cautious . He would try a cautious walk , then , and keep himself as invisible as possible . He pulled his hat down low over his forehead , put one hand in his pocket , and fitted the other with a cigarette . He looked at himself again , and a Palestinian looked back . From the street , you could barely see the house . It was perched on a hill overlooking the Ramallah road , and only its roof was visible from the street that was listed as its mailing address . Fig trees grew in the garden . Their dark green tops rattled up against the roof in the sandy winter wind . There was a rusting red tricycle sitting in a corner of the rooftop . Some old , dusty , machine-made prayer rugs had been scattered here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been covered with makeshift tin , a clothesline ran . Flowered sheets whipped along it . The flapping sheets waved him away , warned him off . The day was dark and the sky was an ochre color that signaled that the hamsin was coming again . Doron hated the desert wind : it coated cars with a film of yellow sand , it got up your nose , it made you cough , and worst of all , it reminded you that Jerusalem , with its McDonald 's and Burger Kings and nice red buses and nice red post offices and its green gardens and flowering terraces and public buildings flanked by fountains , was actually right on the edge of an ancient desert where camels and cactuses and Bedouins were the only successful species . He saw that there was no door from the house onto this street . He left his unhappy taxi driver waiting and went around the corner . He hoped no one would see him ; they would probably be able to spot him as an impostor right away . Down the hill was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with potential and actual car crashes . Across from the house was a big empty lot . Bits of paper trash skittered along its broken ground , and piles of construction materials tiles , cement blocks , bags of sand stood in heaps waiting for the day , long distant , no doubt , when someone would manage to scrape up the money to build something here and also get around to doing it . Facing the Hajimis ' driveway was a big green overflowing garbage dumpster . Doron decided he would stand just a little behind it and wait for Marina to come out . He pulled his wool hat down a bit further around his head . He put the collar of his shirt up against the wind , pulled his sweater-vest tighter , and double-wrapped his long wool scarf , letting its tails hang down at the sides of his neck . He lit a cigarette . Now he looked like someone he would normally avoid . He move farther behind the dumpster , so that he could just see around it . Certainly she would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourning period , especially if her son had died a martyr . Not that Doron imagined that Marina Raad was a particularly devout Muslim . Doron had n't learned much about Islam in his few short days in the library , but he had dipped into a few handbooks in Hebrew and English . First of all , Muhammad ( " Peace Be Upon Him , " as they said in the books ) was always on horseback , which seemed oddly heroic to Doron , who imagined his own prophets as outcasts with mud-caked hair , ranting on street corners , or elderly men with long beards and shepherds ' crooks their transportation at its best an old jackass . The Prophet of Allah ( Peace Be Upon Him ) rode horses and pitched tents and dug trenches for battle , working with shovels and pickaxes . He was like an Israeli pioneer . He made miracles in which rocks turned to sand and a girl 's apronful of dates was made to feed hundreds of trench diggers . He caused lightning to flash from beneath the blow of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jesus as early prophets of Islam . Like so many of these fellows who purveyed the word of God , Muhammad ( PBUH they abbreviated it in the books ) seemed to have had a quirky mind , with opinions on everything . " Do not wear silk , " he is supposed to have told Muslim men . The sexual proscriptions and advice were particularly interesting : according to another book , the Prophet said , " A man is not allowed to have a woman and her paternal aunt as two wives simultaneously , nor a woman and her maternal aunt . " Probably the translations were not great , Doron thought . In any case , you could certainly find equally silly precepts in Judaism . Do not wear blends of linen and wool . Why ? And the other day , Doron had heard that an important rabbi in Jerusalem some jerk with an Old Testament name who wore a high hat and a rich cape encrusted with gold and jewels had advised religious men not to walk between two women , just as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two camels , for fear of becoming like them . And that same rabbi declared no doubt after giving it a lot of thought that it was permissible for an Orthodox man to pick his nose on the Sabbath , but Alka-Seltzer was off-limits because it fizzed . Doron could never take religion seriously . Doron stood there and inhaled the dust and fumes from the Ramallah road , along with his own cigarette smoke . There were things no Israeli did . No Israeli went to Ramallah : it was enemy territory , a place where they wanted to kill you , like certain places in the Old City . The Authority was in charge in Ramallah . If an Israeli walked down the street in Ramallah , these days , he 'd get knifed , people said . But there was no avoiding it for Doron this little wasteland in Ramallah , his post at the dumpster . He was afraid that Marina might see him that if she did , she would recognize him , and after that , who knew what might happen . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too : he hoped maybe she would see him . Two men were walking down the hill , talking . Doron tried to look relaxed as they approached . They squinted at him , and he thought , What if they speak to me ? He drew on his cigarette in what he hoped was a Palestinian way , and kicked at the dirt , looking down , waiting for them to go on . They stopped . He did n't look up . He heard the sound of a lighter being flicked , an exchange of words . He kept his eyes on the ground . The men stood for a moment more , then continued on . Doron lifted his eyes after they passed , and watched them recede down the hill . He tossed his cigarette and tucked himself behind the dumpster . The whole neighborhood used the dumpster , and a bad smell spilled out of it old canned fish , dirty diapers . He closed his eyes , and the scene at the checkpoint came back to him . He saw himself at the communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's scared blue eyes . At the bottom of the hill , a car screeched , glass shattered , and there was distant heated shouting . Closer to Doron , a man 's voice said goodbye . In English . A door opened . Doron peered around the dumpster . Marina was coming out of the garden gate , walking toward the street with the young man Doron had seen at the funeral with her father . Her face was half hidden by a silk scarf and sunglasses . The two of them stood there , silent , staring across the street at the dumpster and the empty lot , and for a moment , Doron thought they had seen him . He pulled his head back a few centimeters . The young man looked at his watch , and then checked the street . He shook his head . Marina stood stiffly apart . She leaned lightly against the wall of the garden . An askadinia tree brushed its thick pointed leaves against her shoulder . They waited . Doron waited with them . He was beginning to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they set off . Doron hurried up the hill and around the corner to his waiting cab and jumped in . He watched Marina 's taxi as it plunged and bucked through the traffic on the Ramallah road . At the side of the street , small children walked with their mothers to the market . At every intersection , young men were waiting to be picked up by jitneys and driven across the checkpoint to the Israeli side of Jerusalem for day work . Today they would wait in vain the closure was still in force but they were eternally desperate and eternally hopeful . Through the small crack in his cab 's curtains , Doron saw a fresh graffito on the walls that were bouncing past . Then he saw it again . He tried to sound it out in his iffy Arabic each time he passed it , translating as he went along . He saw it again . Ah , an " s " sound . He heard himself hissing , " Ssssss , ssssssss . " And then he realized what it said . find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole word , now . It was a word he had learned in training , a long time ago . The CD disk that his driver had hung with a red ribbon from the rearview mirror jumped up and down to the rhythm of the traffic like some kind of measuring device , a meter of impending disaster . Specks of light flicked off it . Doron had always assumed that the disks must be symbolic in some way for Muslims , like the rounded-off crescents that topped so many mosques and minarets . Endless frittering useless thoughts crackled across his brain . He sat back . His stomach bounced . He let himself relax into the car 's worn vinyl upholstery . His taxi followed the same rocking trajectory as Marina 's . Find the soldier . Like a child 's game .
