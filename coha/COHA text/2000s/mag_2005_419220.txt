June 8 , 2004 , was very nearly the last day on earth for Bob Williams . On day four of a planned three-month solo canoe trip down the Yukon River , after 16 hours of paddling , he was overcome by exhaustion . He nodded off for a moment and his canoe capsized . When the stabbing cold water jolted him awake , he grabbed onto the partially submerged canoe . Swift current swept him and the canoe down-river , where steep bluffs bordered both banks . After half an hour he found water shallow enough for him to bail out the canoe and climb back aboard . By then , Williams 's hands were numb ; he was exhausted and spitting up blood . He drifted on the current until he found a sandbar , where he landed the canoe . Picture yourself on a solo canoe trip . You 're miles from help when your canoe suddenly overturns , dumping you into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his life was in serious peril . Reaching inside his coat , he pulled out his ACR personal locator beacon ( PLB ) and activated it . Then he collapsed . Within minutes , the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center processed the distress alert , and in four and a half hours , Bob Williams was found-alive but in need of serious medical treatment . His PLB had saved his life . SPORTSMEN AT RISK Outdoorsmen are among the most likely people to be involved in a search-and-rescue ( SAR ) event . It 's because we 're out there doing things , not just sitting home watching television . We go where the mountains are high and rugged ; where elk bugle through misty forests so deep you get the feeling nobody has been there before ; where the current runs strong and big fish fight hard ; where sudden storms can catch us unprepared ; and where the smallest accident can swallow us up and never reveal its secret . So it 's entirely possible for any of us to become caught up in a search-and-rescue mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a responsibility to help the rescue team find you . I spoke with Larry Nickey , the Fire , Aviation and Emergency Services director for Olympic National Park , to hear recommendations from someone who coordinates SAR operations on a professional level . He 's involved in 15 to 20 major searches each year and up to 70 minor ones , requiring people on the ground , search dogs and helicopters . " One of the best things people can do to assist search-and-rescue teams is to go into the back-country prepared , " Nickey told me . " Take responsibility for yourself . If you get into trouble , stop and think for a few minutes , take a few deep breaths and figure your way out of the problem . " If you end up being the subject of a search , there are things you can do to help the process toward a successful conclusion . Your highest priority is to take all the steps necessary to ensure that you will still be alive when the search team arrives . In other words , medical situations must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established . Those survival issues must be taken care of , or the rescue effort will turn into a recovery mission . THE FIRST 24 HOURS If you 've filed your version of a " flight plan " back home , your family or friends can alert search and rescue in the event you 're overdue . According to Nickey , a search might not be initiated for another 24 hours , because so many people simply end up falling behind schedule and are n't really in the kind of trouble that justifies helicopters , dogs and search teams . That means you need to be able to handle things on your own , at least long enough for the search to get underway . But when you 're truly in serious trouble and being saved is a matter of being rescued by outside help , you need to do everything possible to make sure the SAR team finds you in a hurry . After securing your immediate safety , your highest priority is to make your position obvious to the world . No matter how many well-trained searchers are scouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see you or hear you , they ca n't rescue you . Whether or not they find you in time to save your life will depend a lot on your own actions . We 're talking signaling , both visible and audible . MAKE THEM SEE YOU First try to figure out the most likely spot for searchers to look , then go there and make yourself visible . If possible , establish your camp out in the open in a hillside clearing , on a bare ridge , away from overgrowths of foliage  --  in short , where you 'll be the most obvious thing around . Then make every effort to disturb the surroundings , so an observer will have no trouble seeing that things do n't look natural . Clear the brush and pile it up to spell " SOS " in huge letters . Dig a trench spelling " SOS " ; pile the dirt alongside . Pile rocks to make a big SOS . Drag deadfall into the clearing and shape it into an SOS . You might not think a big SOS on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating is a pattern of raised objects that will cast a shadow against the ground . In snow country , the contrast can be exceptionally easy to spot , especially if you can remove the snow right down to the soil in the area of the SOS . Observed from a plane or a distant ridge , an unnatural pattern of contrast such as this will immediately catch the eye of a rescuer . COLOR AND MOTION Along with creating recognizable patterns , put color to work for you . If you have a brightly colored backpack , sleeping bag , tent fly , or some article of clothing , spread these things around in the clearing or hoist them on a pole so they can flap in the wind . A reflective Space Blanket can be especially effective . Camouflage is n't going to help get you spotted , but your hunter orange vest or cap might . Plan ahead and carry some brightly colored panels of light-weight nylon material with the rest of your survival gear . Install a grommet in each corner and tie a couple of feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , these rescue flags just might save the day . Even if you hunker down in the trees at night to stay dry or get out of the wind , get these colorful items out in the open at the break of day , when the search is likely to resume . " The easiest thing for us to see from a helicopter is movement , " Larry Nickey explains . " One time , we actually flew low and slow right over someone who needed to be rescued , and he stood there , very still , watching us fly past . We never saw the guy . Later , after we had successfully rescued him , he told us that we had passed right overhead but had n't spotted him . We asked why he was n't waving a colorful piece of clothing or something . His answer was , Well , I thought you 'd see me . " ' The lesson ? Do n't hide in the trees or down in a tight canyon where you 'll be almost impossible to spot . Do n't sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open and wave something when the aircraft flies over . SMOKE AND MIRRORS Smoke and mirrors are n't just for magicians ; they 're valuable signaling techniques during daylight hours . A big column of smoke can be seen from miles away . Three columns of smoke will be recognized as a distress signal . Create billowy white smoke by gradually feeding green leafy material or grasses into a fire , or black smoke by burning anything made of a petroleum product . If the wind dissipates the smoke before it can form columns , maybe the scent will drift into adjacent areas and catch someone 's attention . The nice thing about smoke is that it 's an omnidirectional signal . " Be careful with fire , " Nickey warns , " The last thing you want to do is set a forest fire . " If you let a fire get out of control , it might be the very thing that kills you  --  and perhaps others as well . With signal fires , follow standard safety practices for where you build and how you manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many miles , but it is directional , flashing a narrow beam that can be spotted only when it is aimed directly at the viewer . To make a signal mirror more effective , sweep the horizon , back and forth , so someone on the receiving end will see repetitive flashes of light and be able to zero in on its point of origin . If you hear a plane overhead , sweep the sky in the direction of the sound . When the plane is in view , do n't hold the beam on it and blind the pilot . Sweep past it several times until the plane makes a pass overhead and has a fix on your position . If you do n't have a signal mirror , use whatever reflective surfaces you have , even the shiny lid from a pot , a CD or a tent pole . At night , your meticulously laid out SOS patterns wo n't be visible , nor will your colorful panels or your smoke and mirrors . At night , the only visual signal that works is light . FIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distress signal . Form them in a triangle or in a straight line , spread far enough apart that they will not appear as one visual image from a distance . Search-and-rescue teams carry foolproof fire starters , not just inexpensive little lighters , which are easy to fumble with numb , frozen fingers . You want a substantial lighter that fits in your fist and breathes fire like a dragon . Among the best are the Brunton Helios Stormproof and the Windmill Delta Shockproof . Both are refillable butane lighters that wo n't be blown out . They might seem expensive ( around $60 ) , but they 'll work when nothing else will . Some SAR specialists carry lightweight marine flares or road flares in their packs because they 're easy to ignite and will set even damp material on fire . They are also effective signals if someone is near enough to see them . So far , we 've concentrated on visible signals , but in order for them to work , somebody has to be looking in your direction . Audible signals are the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself even if nobody happens to be looking your way . When you need to attract searchers , live loud . Carry a police whistle and use it if you think people are in your vicinity . Blowing a whistle three times ( a universally recognized distress signal ) uses far less energy than screaming until your throat is raw . You 'll stay calmer , too . Bang pots , sing to the trees and talk to yourself ( stick to positive stuff , though ) . Just keep the noise level up , so if someone wanders by , they will know that you 're there . One piece of audible equipment I have is called an Ecohorn . It 's an empty plastic bottle attached to a very loud horn device , and it comes with a small pump so you can refill the bottle with compressed air . It produces more than 50 blasts at 115 decibels before you need to refill . You can find it for $30 at West Marine . ( westmarine.com ) CALL FOR HELP With a phone or a radio , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find you . Just remember , it 's best to leave devices turned off until an emergency arises , to prevent battery depletion . Here are six instruments to consider . CELL PHONES : Cellular phones should not be relied on when you are far from civilization . However , cell towers are popping up everywhere and you just might get lucky . Larry Nickey told me about a recent brutal airplane crash in Washington 's Olympic National Park . The impact was reported to have been so devastating that rescuers did not expect to find any survivors . However , two hours after the crash was reported , and before searchers could reach the area , a call came in to 9-1-1 . One of the passengers had rummaged through the wreckage , found her cell phone and placed the call , " Please come and get us . " SATELLITE PHONES : The price is high for satellite phones , but they are very dependable in the wild . Not relying on local towers , they bounce their signals off satellites , so you can place a call from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radio Service radios are cheap insurance for short-range communications . Their maximum output power is 0.5 watts . My family has a pair of Motorola Talk About units and have used them as far as a couple of miles apart in open terrain . No license is required , no test must be passed and no fee is involved . As you change from channel to channel , you might stumble onto someone who will hear you . GMRS RADIOS : General Mobile Radio Service radios are like FRS radios on steroids . With up to a 5-watt output , propagation is possible over longer distances , depending upon terrain . A 5-year renewable FCC license is required ( $80 fee ) , but there 's no test . Some radios feature both FRS and GMRS capabilities . HAM RADIOS : You must have an FCC license ( 10-year renewable ) to operate a HAM radio . There 's a test , but you need n't know Morse code to get in at the Technician level , which pennits operation on certain VHF and UHF bands . Technically , VHF and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but on my 2-meter hand-held rig , I 've talked with people more than a hundred miles away under ideal conditions . PLB 'S : Personal locator beacons are excellent satellite-based tools for notifying search and rescue people that you 're in trouble . But you better really be in distress before you activate a PLB , or you will most certainly be in trouble when the SAR team finds you . Expensive penalties can be exacted for false alarms . As Nickey reminded me , every time searchers , dogs and helicopters are activated , lives and property are placed at risk . Searchers have lost their lives trying to save others ; helicopters have gone down . You do n't want to trigger a search just because you got hungry and were lonely . But if you ask Bob Williams , he 'll tell you he would n't go into the back-country without his PLB . Go prepared to live on your own and to solve your own problems . But also go prepared to assist search efforts to find you . Be adaptive , because you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to know how to survive and to make your position known through visible and audible signals . 10 WAYS TO GET FOUND 1 . Before you leave home , create a fairly detailed plan for your trip and leave it with someone you trust , along with instructions to contact search and rescue if you do n't come home on schedule . 2 . Your highest priority is to stay alive . Use all the survival tricks that are appropriate for the season and location . Among the most important are signaling techniques to help attract the SAR team . 3 . Position yourself in a clearing so you-can be spotted from a distance . 4 . Disturb the surroundings , so things on the ground around you do n't look natural . 5 . Use color , contrast and an SOS symbol on the ground to grab the eyes of searchers . Motion will attract attention . Wave your arms , or hoist a colored fabric panel to serve as a wind-driven signal flag . 6 . Always carry a signal mirror and know how to use it safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including powerful lighters and road flares or handheld ( non-aerial ) marine flares. 8 . Set up three signal fires and use smoke by day and flame by night . 8 . Utilize audible signal devices , including cell phones , radios , whistles , gunfire and other noisemakers 9 . In life-or-death emergencies , activate your personal locator beacon . Illustration <p>
