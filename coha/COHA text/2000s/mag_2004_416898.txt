These are the women who changed the face of music . // NEW ORLEANS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THF . " GRADLE of Jazz , " the " Birthplace of Jazz , " or the " Incubator of Jazz . " But despite the mothering metaphors , the musicians credited with bearing , rocking and nurturing early New Orleans jazz are invariably men . // Opposite : Ann Cook 's voice stopped traffic ; Dolly Douroux Adams ( left ) was a one woman band . // One thinks of trumpeter Louis Armstrong , cornet player Buddy Bolden or the irrepressible pianist Jelly Roll Morton . If women enter the historical memory at all , they 're usually relegated to the extravagant brothels that are as much a part of the popular imagination of New Orleans as gumbo and Mardi Gras . It 's time to correct history . Women did contribute to New Orleans jazz , in many and significant ways . They played bawdy piano in the famous red-light district of Storyville . They were instrumentalists , vocalists , dancers and bandleaders . Female piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jazz ensemble . And female bluessingers influenced the sound and phrasing of New Orleans ' trumpet players . Early blues queens Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey-who often played in the Crescent City-as well as noted hometown blues belters such as Lizzie Miles , Edna Hicks , Mary Mack ( McBride ) and Esther Bigeou , have often been miscast as precursors to jazz rather than essential participants in the birth of the music . While it 's true that blues preceded jazz as an American musical idiom , many women blues singers performed with jazz bands and appeared on early jazz recordings well beyond the passing of that torch . My own research and that of other music historians , along with the efforts of a feminist park ranger at the recently opened New Orleans Jazz Historical Park ( see sidebar ) , have begun to fill in history 's lapses . Here , then , are some of the stories that have been uncovered of talented and determined women who marched to their own beats and , in the process , made jazz history . THE VOICE OF STORYVILLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be young , gifted and black , but that 's when teenaged Ann Cook left her rural Louisiana home to move to New Orleans . Against the bleak backdrop of lynchings , economic depression and the emergence of Jim Crow laws , the city beckoned to thousands of rural black Southerners as a refuge from racist violence . Employment options were limited , however , and most rural black women migrants exchanged hard lives of sharecropping for servitude in white women 's kitchens . Cook , whose mother was a domestic worker , set her sights on one of the few better alternatives available to a black woman with talent : the burgeoning entertainment industry . Photograph Opposite : Ann Cook 's voice stopped traffic ; Dolly Douroux Adams ( left ) was a one woman band . // She lived in a section of New Orleans so tough that it was known as " The Battlefield . " This was also the neighborhood of Louis Armstrong , a generation younger , and his predecessor on jazz cornet , Buddy Bolden , who was Cook 's contemporary . Like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she also found work singing . She possessed a unique voice , a memory for endless verses and a powerful sound-by turns playful or mournful , raspy or full . In madame Willie Piazza 's popular Storyville brothel , Ann Cook carved out her reputation as the favorite barrelhouse blues singer . Storyville-an area of the city that was literally zoned for prostitution and where sex workers were legally confined even when offduty-often featured musical entertainment in its plush brothels . Tales of Storyville center on piano men such as Jelly Roll Morton and Tony Jackson , but women also played and sang in its parlors . For example , brothel owner Antonia Gonzales advertised herself as " the only cornetplaying madam in Storyville . " She performed duets with renowned pianists . Pianist/singer Mamie Desdunes , an early influence on Jelly Roll Morton , played the brothel circuit , as did pianists Rosalind Johnson , Camilla Todd and Wilhelmina Bart . After the Navy dismantled Storyville at the beginning of World War I , Ann Cook simply moved her act to the lively cafs and bars on South Rampart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she did n't show up for a recording date of Louis Dumaine 's Jazzola Eight in 1927 , band members searched the city , retrieved her from the caf where she had sung the previous night and whisked her to the session before the recording crew from Victor Records could get away . As a result , she can be heard on two of the few recordings black musicians made in New Orleans in the 1920s . Rosalind Johnson recalled that Cook 's recordings of " Mama Cookie Blues " and " He 's the Sweetest Black Man in Town " ( both available on the Frog CD " Sizzling the Blues " ) could " stop the traffic " on Rampart Street . THE NATURAL In 1917 , when 31-year-old Ann Cook was still a regular at Willie Piazza 's , 13-year-old Dolly Douroux played piano just a block down Basin Street at Lulu White 's Mahogany Hall . White was one of Storyville 's most successful madams , famous for supplying light-skinned Creoles-of-color prostitutes , considered exotic by white middle- and upper-class men ( blacks , and Creoles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and African-could work in Storyville but not be customers ) . Both of Dolly 's parents played trumpet , Louis Douroux in a brass band . But codes of feminine respectability restricted Olivia Manetta Douroux 's public playing : Only at private parties could guests delight in the stunningly difficult duets she would play with her husband . Growing up in this musical atmosphere , Dolly Douroux learned to play bass , drums , trumpet and guitar , but her skill as a pianist gave her special cachet . Since the earliest jazz bands were marching units , pianos were out of the question , but when bands began to play in venues with pianos , the instrument became a staple . Piano chordings helped anchor the improvised , interwoven melodies of the brass and reed players . Thus , an activity considered a respectable " feminine " accomplishmentplaying the piano-came to be valued by bands made up primarily of men . Other women in this formidable generation of early jazz-band pianists include the aforementioned Todd and Bart , along with Margaret Kimble , Jeanette SaIvant ( Kimball ) and Mercedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand with bands all over the city , including those led by Peter Bocage , Luis " Papa " Tio , Lorenzo Tio Jr . and Alphonse Picou . She also organized her own ensemble to accompany vaudeville acts at the Othello Theatre on South Rampart Street . But in 1922 , Dolly married Placide Adams , who preferred that his wife stay home . So Dolly Adams bore and raised a musical family , training all seven of her children on multiple instruments . When the family ran into financial hardship in 1937 , however , Placide finally allowed his wife to resume her career . First with her brothers and then with three of her sons , Dolly Douroux Adams continued to rock New Orleans into the 1960s . THE DOWNTOWN GIRL In 1929 , when Ann Cook 's records were causing a stir and Dolly Adams was raising her musical family , 19year-old Yvonne Fasnacht was learning clarinet and alto saxophone at a New Orleans trade academy , the Nicholls School . ( Three other talented instrumentalists at the school , who played banjo , piano and sax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most famous singing trios of the 1930s , the Boswell Sisters . ) Most of the Nicholls students were from the middle and upper classes , but Fasnacht was a working-class " downtown girl " of Swiss , German and French descent . Photograph Opposite : " Dixie " Fasnacht and her clarinet ; Baby Briscoe ( left ) wore the pants in the band . // Throughout the 1930s , " Dixie " Fasnacht traveled in and out of New Orleans with all-women bands , including the Sophisticates of Swing and the Southland Rhythm Girls . The latter were enthusiastically reviewed in Down Beat for " hitting ' em high on the clarinet and supplying the vocal swing , " and the band even appeared in a short film , Speedy Justice , m 1935 . While Fasnacht was on the road , her sister Irma opened a bar , and Dixie soon returned to New Orleans to help run it . Dixie 's Bar of Music had two locations over its 25 years of operation , the second at the current Bourbon Street location of the Cat 's Meow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender-integrated Dixieland band . Along with pianist Dorothy Sloop and other bandmates , she recorded an album in 1957 called " Dixie and Sloopy , " but the record company would not allow them to record with their usual bassist-a man ! Apparently it only made sense to record women jazz musicians if the ensemble was strictly female . Today , Dixie , now in her 90s , still complains about the music industry 's illogic that prevented her original band from recording . THE BABY Neliska Briscoe was another New Orleans local who achieved national attention in an all-woman band . She 's fondly remembered by a generation of black New Orleanians as Baby Briscoe , acquiring the name as a child star in the 1920s . Her mother , a convent cook who had roots in Mexico ( where many Creoles of color fled during the rise of Jim Crow ) , would take her talented daughter to the Alley Cabaret . There , Baby would wow audiences with her acrobatic dancing and charismatic stage presence . The theatrical entertainers of jazz-chorus lines , dance teams and acrobatic dancers-often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often those performers ' names and artistry that attracted a crowd . Briscoe , who pursued a dance career in New York in her early teens , returned to New Orleans in 1933 as the star attraction of the popular band Joe Robichaux 's Rhythm Boys , which at various times also included trumpet player Ann Cooper and singer Joan Lunceford ( ne Daisy Lowe ) . Robichaux led the band at rehearsals , while Baby-splendid in her trademark tuxedo , baton in hand-conducted their performances at the Rhythm Club . During Mardi Gras dances , Briscoe also fronted the visiting Harlem Playgirls , a Minneapolisbased African American all-woman band organized in 1935 by drummer Sylvester Rice . New Orleans was never simply an origin point for jazz , but an important stop for traveling and migrating musicians , and the Playgirls-including trumpet player Tiny Davis , who would later play with such well-liked 1940s bands as the International Sweethearts of Rhythm-were wildly popular . After the Playgirls ' smash New Orleans appearance in the spring of 1938 , Briscoe joined them on the road for two years , earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the girls ' in the groove ' while swinging out with their hot numbers , has won her a good reputation as a band leader , " wrote The Pittsburgh Courier in 1938 . When the band played New Orleans , black people from all over the city turned out to cheer their local prodigy-turned-headliner . Photograph Opposite : " Dixie " Fasnacht and her clarinet ; Baby Briscoe ( left ) wore the pants in the band . // By the early 1940s , Briscoe settled back in her hometown , this time to marry and to raise a family . She left the stage , but it was a sacrifice her children would " never hear the end of , " according to her daughters . AND THE BAND PLAYED ON In the years following World War II , the first New Orleans " Revival " swept the U.S. , invigorating a younger generation 's interest in early jazz . William Russell was just one of the historians and collectors who sought out original players , and in 1949 he asked Ann Cook to record with other early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now a church lady whose powerful voice rocked the choir at Greater St. Matthew Baptist Church No. 2 . She finally agreed to record not the blues , but a gospel number , " The Lord Will Make A Way " ( available on " Jazzin the Blues , " Document Records ) . She never returned to the blues before her death in 1962 . A second New Orleans revival occurred around 1960 with the opening of new venues devoted to traditional jazz , including the stillthriving Preservation Hall in the city 's French Quarter . Many women have played and led bands at Preservation Hall , such as pianists Sweet Emma Barren , Billie Pierce and Jeanette Kimball , who were among the pioneer instrumentalists in the 1920s but became better-known in the autumn of their careers because of playing the Hall . The gutsy coowner of Preservation Hall , Sandra Jaffe , was female and white , and she went to jail more than once for maintaining an integrated institution in a segregated city . Dolly Douroux Adams played piano and led bands through both revivals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( she died in 1979 ) . Yvonne " Dixie " Fasnacht still lives in the Bourbon Street cottage that she and her now-deceased sister Irma retired to in 1964 . Dixie 's Bar of Music holds another distinction in New Orleans ' history : It was considered one of the city 's first gay bars . Sexuality is not something people of Miss Dixie 's generation discuss easily , but she will agree that the gay crowd was " very loyal . " So were the Fasnacht sisters : In 1962 , when an entire gay Mardi Gras Carnival Krewe was arrested , Miss Dixie posted their bail . In 1997 , she was honored by the gay and lesbian community of New Orleans as a " living testament to the history of gay New Orleans . " Throughout her spectacular career as a dancer and band leader , Neliska Baby Briscoe longed to play an instrument-so she took up the alto saxophone in her 60s . She remained proud of her dance career as well , performing the splits on her 75th birthday and dancing for guests at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain ; it was bone cancer . During the final months of Neliska Briscoe 's life , a hospice nurse told her daughter that Briscoe had become " a little confused , " because she had regaled the staff with fantastic stories about wearing a tuxedo and leading an orchestra . " That is n't confused , " said the daughter . " She really did that . " And women in early jazz ? Yes , they really did that . Sidebar Feminist Jazz in the Park New Orleans Jazz Historical Park Ranger Margie Ortiz took it upon herself to dispel the myth that New Orleans jazz was an entirely male invention . She proposed a study entitled " A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen , " which was supported by the park staff . The resulting 300-page report will soon be used to enhance the educational programming and exhibits at the park . You can visit the park online at www.nps.gov/jazz .

It was just a backhand , though  --  not like when I saw Tommy Bucksmith 's dad wallop him so hard that when he hit the pavement his head actually bounced . I s'pose Richard did n't know about the flips I used to do with Daddy where you face each other and while you 're holding on to your daddy 's hands you climb up his legs to right above the knees and then push off , through the triangle that your arms make with his . It 's super fun . I was just trying to show Richard how it works . Anyway , I learned then and there to stay clear of Richard . I try to stay away from home as much as I possibly can . <p> It 's impossible to get lost in a town called Toast . <p> That 's where I live : Toast , North Carolina . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets are named for what 's on them . There 's Post Office Road and Front Street , which takes you past the front of the stores , and Back Street , which is one street over  --  in back of them . There 's New Church Road , even though the church that sits at the end of it is n't new anymore . There 's Brown 's Farm Road , which is where Hollis Brown lives with his family , and before him came other Browns who Momma knew and did n't like all that much , and Hilltop Road and even River-bend Road . So wherever you set out for , the street signs will lead the way . I live on Murray Mill Road , and I s'pose if you did n't know any better you 'd think my last name 's Murray , but it 's Parker  --  Mr. Murray passed on way before we got here . We did n't change a thing about the Murray house : the way in from Route 74 is just grass growing up between two straight lines so your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you see after you 've been driving till the count of sixty is the mill barn that 's being held up over the pond by old stilts . We still have the board with peeling painted letters that says No Fishing on Sunday nailed up to the tree on the edge of the pond . Just to the side of that , taking up a whole outside wall of the mill , is Mr. Murray 's old sign that shows a cartoon rooster cock-a-doo-dle-doing the words Feed NutrenaBe Sure , Be Safe , Be Thrifty . It 's getting hard to read the words of the poster now that a fine red dust from the dirt outside the mill has settled over it top to bottom . But you can see the rooster clear as day . Tacked up to the door of the old mill is this : " WARNING : It is unlawful for any person to sell , deliver , or hold or offer for sale any adulterated or misbranded grain . Maximum penalty $100 fine or 60 days imprisonment or both . " I copied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The notebook goes flying out of my hands into the dirt . <p> " Betcha did n't see that coming ! " Richard laughs at me as I scramble to pick it up before he gets ahold of it . " Must be something pretty important , you grabbing at it like that . Lemme see there , " and he pulls it out of my hands before I can make a squeak about it . <p> " Give it back . " <p> " ' Collie McGrath is n't talking to me on account of the frog incident ' what 's the frog incident ? " He looks up from my diary . <p> " Give it back ! " But when I go to try to get it back he shoves me away , flipping through the pages , scanning each one with his dirty finger . " Where am I ? I ca n't wait to see what all you write about me . Hmm , " more flipping , " Momma this , Momma that . Jesus H.

" There ! Gave ya something to write about ! " I live here with my stepfather , Richard , my momma , and my sister , Emma . Emma and I are like Snow White and Rose Red . That 's probably why it 's our favorite bedtime story . It 's about two sisters : one has really white skin and yellow hair ( just like Momma ) and the other one has darker skin and hair that 's the color of the center of your eye ( that 's just like me ) . My hair changes colors depending on where you 're standing and when . From the side in the daytime , my hair looks purple-black , but from the back at night it 's like burned wood in the fireplace . When it 's clean , Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , white , white . But usually it 's so dirty it looks like the dusty old letters Momma keeps in a shoe box on her closet shelf . <p> Richard . Now there 's a guy who is n't like anyone we 've read about at bedtime . Momma says he 's as different from Daddy as a cow from a crow , and I believe her . I mean , would n't you have to be likable to make everyone line up to buy carpet from you like Momma says they did for Daddy ? Richard 's not half as likable . I told Momma once that I thought Richard was hateable , but she did n't think it was funny so she sent me to my room . A few days later , when Richard was back picking on Momma she yelled out that no one liked him and that his own stepdaughter called him " hateable . " When she said it I just stood there listening to the tick-tick-tick of the plastic daisy clock we have hanging in the kitchen , knowing it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best carpet salesman in the state of North Carolina . He must 've sold a ton of carpet because there was n't any left for us . We have hard linoleum . After he died Momma let me keep the leaf-green sample of shag that she found in the back seat of his car when she was cleaning it out before Mr. Dingle took it away . The sample must 've fallen off the big piece of cardboard that had lots of other squares on it in different colors so folks could match it to their lives better . I keep it in the drawer of the white wicker night table by my bed in an old cigar box that has lots of colorful stickers of old-fashioned suitcases , stamps and airplanes ( only on the cigar box they 're spelled aeroplanes ) slapped on every which way . Sometimes if I sniff into that shag square real hard I can still pick up that new carpet smell that followed Daddy around like a shadow . <p> Back to me and Emma . Our hair is different colors but our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vanilla difference . Emma looks like someone got bored painting her and just left her blank for someone else to fill in . Me ? Well , Miss Mary at White 's Drugstore always tilts her head to the side and says , " You look tired , chile , " when she sees me , but I 'm not  --  it 's just the shadows under my eyes . <p> I 'm eight  --  two years older than Emma , but because I 'm small people probably think we 're mismatched twins . And that 's the way we think of each other . But I wish I could be more like Emma . I scream when I see a cicada , but Emma does n't mind them . She scoops them up and puts them outside . I tell her she should just step on them but she does n't listen to me . And she never gets picked on by the other kids . Once , Tommy Bucksmith twisted her arm around her back and held it there for a long time ( " until you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at the time , laughing while he winched her arm backward higher and higher ) and she did n't make a peep . Emma 's not scared of anything . Except for when Richard turns on Momma . Then we both go straight to behind-the-couch . Behind-the-couch is like another room for me and Emma . It 's our fort . Anyway , we usually head there when we 've counted ten squeaks from the foot pedal of the metal trash can in the kitchen . The bottles clank so loud I think my head 'll split in two . <p> Richard starts bugging Momma after about the tenth squeak . I do n't know why Momma does n't stay out of his way from squeak eight on but she does n't . Me and Emma , we 've started a thing we call the floor shimmy where , when we hear squeak eight we start to scoot our behinds real slow from the floor in front of the TV toward behind-the-couch . With the volume up you ca n't hear us , and Richard 's concentrating real hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward behind-the-couch . By squeak nine , we 're about two Barbie-doll lengths from the front of the couch , and just before squeak ten we 're sliding between the cool paint on the wall and the nubby brown plaid back of the couch . We used to think it was stinky behind-the-couch , but we do n't even notice it anymore . I brought some of Momma 's perfume there once and squirted it twice right into the fabric so now it smells just like Momma on Sunday . <p> We live in an old white house with chipping yellow shutters . It 's three floors high , if you count the attic where me and Emma sleep . We used to have our own room across the hall from Momma and Daddy 's room , but after he died and Richard moved in we had to go up another floor . But here 's the worst part : Richard 's making us move . I cai n't even think about that right now . When I do n't want to think about something I just pretend there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brain that 's thinking the bad thing and pushes on it real hard so it goes to the back of all the other things I could be thinking about . <p> Momma says it 's trashy to have stuff out front of our house like we do so she goes and plants flowers in some of it so it 'll look like we 've got it there on purpose . Here 's what we 've got : three tires  --  one of them has grass already growing from the pile of dirt that 's in the middle of it ; a cat statue that 's gray like a sidewalk ; Richard 's old car that he says will come back to life one of these days , but when it does I think it 'll be confused since it does n't have any tires on it ; Momma 's old tin washtub with flowers planted in it ; a hammock Emma and me liked to swing in when we were really young , but now one side 's all frayed because we never took it inside in the winter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain rot ; a metal rooster that points in the direction of a storm if one 's coming ; and Richard 's old work boots . Momma up and planted flowers in them , too . I 've never seen flowers in boots before , but she did it and sure enough there 're daisies pushing up out of them right this minute . Oh , I almost forgot , Momma 's clothesline is out there , too . <p> We do n't have a front walk to get to the door to the house . I wish we did . Snow White and Rose Red have a front walk that takes you through an archway of roses . We just have grass that 's been walked on so much it 's dirt . But then you get to the front porch and that 's the part I like best . It makes a lot of noise when you walk on it but I like being able to look out over everything . <p> " What 're you doing ? " Emma asks . Where she came from I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm standing here on the front porch , surveying our yard and all the things we 've got .

" <p> " Who 're you waving at ? " <p> " I was n't waving . " <p> " Were , too . You 're pretending you 're a princess again , are n't you ? " Emma sits in Momma 's old rocker that 's missing most of the seat . She 's smiling ' cause she knows she nailed me . <p> " Was not . " <p> " Was to . What color dress you wearing ?

They 're even softer than the lace . But the best part is my shoes . My shoes are made of glass , just like Cinderella 's , and they have diamonds on the tips so they can match my dress . " <p> Emma 's eyes are closed but she 's nodding . <p> " And here are my loyal subjects . " I sweep my arm across the railing toward the yard . " They all love me because I 'm a good princess , not a mean one like my stepsister . I give them food and money  --  and I talk to them like they 're in my family .

I cai n't tell for sure but it looks like he might not be in too bad a mood right now . I 'm keeping my fingers crossed on that one . <p> " Whatchoo up to on this fine North Carolina day ?
