At the Winter Olympics an all-access pass is called an E credential , and it 's rather like the old E ticket at Disneyland , which granted entry to all the best rides . The 2002 Games pass , emblazoned with a black E , is roughly the size of the golden ticket tucked into a Willy Wonka bar . Remember ? It allowed the lucky holder to tour the chocolate factory . I have a golden ticket  --  an E credential at the Olympics  --  and a week to use it . Its privileges are exactly as Wonka sang : If you want to view paradise/Simply look around and view it/Anything you want to , do it/Want to change the world ? /There 's nothing to it . // So we are standing , at a private party in a Salt Lake City club called Splash , before a chocolate waterfall . Jim Craig , Marion Jones and Danny Kass  --  Olympians past and present , summer and winter-marvel at the machine that produces it , which appears to have sprung from Wonka 's own mechanical pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley Cup , issues an endless cascade of liquid chocolate , into which partygoers dip marshmallows and strawberries impaled on skewers . " It 's like something you 'd see at Caligula 's bar mitzvah , " says a dumbstruck diner . He 's right , of course , and already it 's clear : This week with the golden ticket will be unlike any other . So : Make a wish/Count to three/Come with me .... // The Winter Olympics , like Willy Wonka 's and Walt Disney 's kingdoms , belong to the young . So our E ticket takes us first to the halfpipe final in Park City . There , a P.A. announcer introduces the sport 's first star , Terry Kidwell , as " the grandfather of snowboarding . " He is 38 . An emcee asks a 12-year-old in the grandstand if he 'd like tickets to tonight 's Foo Fighters concert , which will follow the medals ceremony in Salt Lake City . The 12-year-old shouts into the microphone , " That would be sick ! " // Six hours later the boy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , when the American snowboarders who swept the halfpipe shamble onstage . Kass , hair in his eyes , hands sucked into the sleeves of his jacket , looks like a child dressed against his will for Sunday school . For five minutes the New Jersey native stands stoically in the spotlight with his teammates . Then at 9 p.m . Mountain time , before 20,000 spectators and untold millions watching on television , he dips his head to accept a silver medal , and a magical thing happens : The glint on his chest is matched , unmistakably , by one in his eyes . // Picabo Street can see it from 44 miles away , while watching television near the Snowbasin ski resort . " Some of them are little tough guys who tried to act like it was n't their childhood dream to win an Olympic medal , " says Street of the snow-boarders , " but even the toughest one , the one from New Jersey , got a little tear in his eye for a second . That 's what the Olympics are about : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the medals podium now mechanically slides from the stage , and in the snowboarders ' place stand the Foo Fighters . The band 's lead singer is 33-year-old Dave Grohl , the former drummer for Nirvana , the biggest rock and roll band of his generation , and still Grohl professes honor and astonishment to be playing the Olympics . " I want to dedicate this next song to Jim Craig , goalie on the 1980 Olympic hockey team , " he says . " When I was a kid , that guy was my hero , man . I swear to God . I talked to him on the phone today , and that was just the coolest thing in the world . " Grohl adjusts his guitar and says again , " I swear to God . " // Then he plays the first chord of the song My Hero , and the sea of people in front of the stage begins to pogo up and down for warmth . But it apparently does n't work , because everywhere one looks , goose pimples are in evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Snowbasin , site of the men 's and women 's downhill courses , two narrow slopes that come together at the finish , a white wishbone cut into the mountainside . The men 's course is pitched at 38 degrees . The stairs in your house are pitched at 27 . To get a feel for the downhill , simply steepen your staircase by almost half , coat it in ice , increase its length a thousandfold , insert hairpin turns and  --  this part is crucial  --  remove the stairs . Then try skiing down it . // On this day the women are traveling at interstate speed , flying 40 yards in the air off Lindh 's Launch , farther than some professionals can kick a football on Sunday . Petra Haltmayr of Germany is skiing only nine days after dislocating her right shoulder . Every woman removes her helmet at the finish to reveal perfect teeth and uncanny eloquence . The top American finisher  --  in 11th place  --  is baby-faced Jonna Mendes , of Heavenly , Calif. , who holds a giant novelty rose in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " and I 've already had plenty of injuries and surgeries . But it 's worth it . Because how could you not want to be out here doing this ? " // Picabo Street is only eight years older than Mendes , but they have been dog years . After winning gold at the 1998 Games , she had a horrific crash in which she tore up her right knee and broke her left leg . However , during the last three years she has competed again , mostly in Europe , far from her hometown of Triumph , Idaho . Says Street , " My parents used to wait for a 3 a.m. phone call that said , ' I won again , Dad ! ' But in the last three years it 's been , ' I 'm done , and I 'm safe . ' " // After safely negotiating the downhill on this day  --  finishing in 16th place  --  Street announces her retirement . In an instant her youth has been returned to her . " I look forward to sliding around on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . She smiles and says that from this day forward , " I 'll always be a child on my skis . It will be a way of staying young forever . " // If you want to view paradise , simply look around and view it : In Park City two members of the Iranian ski team are giddily camcording one another in front of a chalet . It is hard to think of them , in their black-and-purple Mizuno ski jackets , as an Axis of Evil . Perhaps when their competition is over , they 'll patronize Salt Lake City 's Dead Goat Saloon , whose urinals each contain a plastic screen stenciled with the likeness of Osama bin Laden and the salutary message STOP TERRORISM . // Imagine there 's no countries . It is n't hard to do at the Olympics , especially in the grandstand at the 120-meter ski jumping final , at which Imagine plays on the public address system . What is it about this sport , about these men soaring in space suits , that so captivates the imagination ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skis in a chevron  --  like geese flying in formation backward  --  looks as though he 'll never alight . When he says afterward , " I never would have believed this could be possible , " it is n't clear if he 's referring to his gold medal or the physics of the 133-meter jump that won it for him . Imagine , indeed . // Ammann receives his gold hours later at the Medals Plaza . He is followed onstage by Barenaked Ladies ( and offstage , no doubt , by barenaked ladies ) , whose surprise guests tonight are fellow Canadians Jamie Sal ? and David Pelletier , the wronged pair of pairs skaters , whose Lutzes and Axels have been replayed endlessly all week on TV in Zapruder-like slow motion . " We 'd like to congratulate them for the tremendous class and dignity with which they handled the controversy , " says BNL singer Ed Robertson , who wears only a banjo and a Canada speed skating suit that looks like sausage casing . " Because when we lost the Grammy to Brian Setzer , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , ' Fix ! He sucks ! ' " // Speaking of barenaked Canadians , Francois Gagnon is a sports-writer for Le Soleil , a Quebec City newspaper . After a late night out , Gagnon returns to his hotel room in suburban Salt Lake City . Unable to sleep , he rises from bed , opens his door and stoops to retrieve the complimentary newspaper lying there like a doormat . As he does so , the scribe hears a dismaying click . The door has closed , and locked , behind him . Francois Gagnon is standing in the hallway of the Crystal Inn , in Murray , Utah , stark naked at three o'clock in the morning . So he wraps USA Today around him like a bath towel and reports his problem to the desk clerk , who escorts him back to the room and opens the door . Ten minutes later , according to Gagnon , there is a knock on his door : the police . If he does n't check out , they may charge him with indecent exposure . Gagnon complies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a broadsheet and not a tabloid . " // At the Winter Olympics one gets the most out of life , to say nothing of the Life section of USA Today . Which is how it happens that early in the morning , Dutch speed skater Gianni Romme is photographed  --  for a Netherlands newspaper  --  naked at the speed skating start line , inside the Utah Olympic Oval . In these Winter Games of Wonka and Lennon , some people nevertheless leave nothing to the imagination . // We 'll begin with a spin/Traveling in the world of my creation/What we 'll see will defy explanation . Canadian speed skater Catriona LeMay Doan is married , preposterously , to a Zamboni driver . Bart Doan is also a rodeo cowboy , and when his wife wins the 500-meter final , she skates a victory lap in his black ten-gallon hat . The night before her big race , LeMay Doan confesses , she was a basket case . " It was , " she says , " like I was 12 again . " Reverting to childhood : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling . // Punching our golden ticket at the aerials skiing is Guo Xin Xin , a tiny Chinese woman attempting to land  --  on skis  --  a twisting triple somersault off a jump that is three times as tall as she is . Xin Xin , alas , makes a quarter turn too many and falls , from the sky , flat on her back . Lying there in her helmet and goggles , she resembles the victim of a skydiving accident . But suddenly  --  and to great applause  --  Xin Xin stands , and then she does something even more remarkable : She takes her second jump , another attempt at a triple somersault . She lands it , though only by the hair of her Xinny Xin Xin. // Among Xin Xin 's colleagues on the Chinese Olympic team are two of the world 's finest female short-track speed skaters , Yang Yang and Yang Yang . To help Western journalists distinguish between them , Chinese officials have designated them Yang Yang ( A ) and Yang Yang ( S ) . Yang Yang ( A ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L ) , for Large , though she is precisely the same size as Yang Yang ( S ) , for Small . When Yang Yang ( L ) objected to her nominal inflation , she was christened Yang Yang ( A ) , which does n't stand for anything , or  --  for that matter  --  Anything . // Implausible , yes , but then who would have believed  --  only a week ago  --  in chocolate waterfalls ? " Skiing is all about balance , " long shot Carole Montillet of France said after winning the women 's downhill . So is life . Only four months ago Montillet 's friend and teammate Regine Cavagnoud was killed after colliding with a coach on an Alpine run . Montillet was at the scene of the accident , and for weeks after she was , in her words , " fed up " with the world . In recent days , however , for reasons she chose to keep private , Montillet had found her equilibrium restored . " Now I 'm a very happy person , " she said upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel I have a full life . " Not a single skier expressed disappointment at having lost to her , given all that Montillet had gained . " If you 're paying attention , " said Street , " you see God 's hand in this . " // Such yin and yang  --  or yin and Yang Yang  --  make sports ceaselessly interesting . In the Olympics there really are world-class athletes from Heavenly and Triumph , and several times a day , every day , someone is realizing a childhood dream . // All it takes is imagination . Imagine : Twenty-two years ago , when the U.S. hockey team played the Soviets in Lake Placid , the two nations were engaged , eternally , it seemed , in a game of nuclear chicken . The Olympic teams , too , were sinister strangers to each other . Today the Russians are little more  --  or less  --  than our " economic partners , " as U.S. defenseman Brian Rafalski puts it . Almost all of the players are colleagues in the NHL . Imagine . Evil Empire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week with the golden ticket , the E credential , expires at midnight Mountain time this evening , and  --  as luck would have it  --  so does the U.S.- Russia hockey game . It ends , aptly , in a 2-2 tie , and all about the arena fans benignly fly the flags of both nations . It is an astonishing sight . Simply look around and view it . // Want to change the world ? There 's nothing to it .
