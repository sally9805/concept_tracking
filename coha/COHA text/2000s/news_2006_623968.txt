<p> San Francisco 's Board of Education Thursday night voted to close , merge and relocate more than a dozen public schools to save some of the millions that the district says it lost this year due to declining enrollment . <p> The board did its work during a five-hour meeting before hundreds of angry parents , students and teachers who filled the Everett Middle School auditorium and occasionally shouted  --  or wept aloud  --  as the panel voted on a case-by-case basis . <p> The first vote hardly caused a stir in the crowd : the Japanese Bilingual Bicultural Program will be merged into Rosa Parks Elementary School , the board decided after some debate . <p> But when the board voted to close John Swett Elementary and merge it into John Muir Elementary , Dawayne Baker , a volunteer basketball coach at John Swett , burst out of the auditorium . <p> " What are we supposed to do now ? " he yelled as he cried in the hallway . " Go to John Muir and start all over again ? They do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the black community . They know most of us do n't have a choice . We have to send our kids to public schools . " <p> In the end , the board decided to close four schools , spare six from closure and relocate or merge many others  --  all to save $2.4 million , about half of the $5 million goal . The changes take effect in June , at the end of the school year . <p> " These were modest changes , " said board member Dan Kelly after it was all done . Kelly had supported more changes but did not have a majority vote of the board . " We should have closed more . For all that anxiety , all that stress , all that anger  --  this is all we saved . " <p> Thursday 's meeting was the second by the board in a week to draw hundreds of residents . The first meeting , on Jan. 12 , ended with the board postponing action for seven days in hopes that the Board of Supervisors and Mayor Gavin Newsom would grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another year . <p> But Newsom flatly rejected the idea , saying the city over the past year already has provided the schools with $35 million in money and in-kind services . <p> The closures and mergers represent the biggest upheaval in the district in decades , affecting thousands of students and hundreds of district employees . <p> Among other changes made by the board were the following :  --  Enola Maxwell Middle School , Luther Burbank Middle School and Cabrillo Elementary School will be closed .  --  International Studies Academy will be relocated to the site of Enola Maxwell .  --  Aim High will be moved to the site of Luther Burbank.  --  Downtown High School will move to the site now occupied by International Studies Academy .  --  Center for Independent Studies will be moved to the site now occupied by the Japanese Bilingual Bicultural Program .  --  Edison Charter will be relocated to a site that has yet to be determined , and was not expected to be announced Thursday night .  --  Newcomer High School will move to the site of Edison Charter .  --  Leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to be determined . <p> The board also voted against closing , merging or relocating the following schools :  --  Peabody Elementary , Malcolm X Elementary , McKinley Elementary , Ortega Elementary , Rosa Parks Elementary and Sheridan Elementary will not be closed .  --  New Traditions and Grattan elementary schools will not be merged .  --  Willie Brown College Preparatory Academy will not be relocated .  --  The county programs  --  Community Scholars for Success , Real Alternative High School and Phoenix  --  will not be relocated .  --  Starr King and Daniel Webster elementary schools will not be merged . <p> " We 've staved it off for 15 years , but we have to pay the piper  --  the time is here , " board member Kelly said before the meeting . " To use money just to keep a dwindling school alive is not wise . I understand that it 's difficult , but looking at it overall , it 's not the board 's fault enrollment in particular schools is going down , and it 's not the board 's fault that families have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco Unified School District officials say they have lost 800 to 1,000 students every year for the past five years , a trend expected to continue for the next five years . The board and district staff agree they can not continue to operate the same number of schools with such a severe drop in the student population . <p> The $5 million represents the amount of money lost this year in per-pupil funding from the state . <p> The 26 schools were chosen by district staff because they have fewer than 250 students and use less than 75 percent of their building capacity . The seven-member elected board was charged with deciding which schools from that list should actually close or merge in June . <p> A big concern of the board , parents and school staff members has been the fact that the proposed changes would affect African American students far out of proportion to their representation in the district . Last year , the board closed three schools in the heavily African American Western Addition neighborhood . <p> " To target the same community we did last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanchez , who tried unsuccessfully Thursday night to , once again , delay the school closures . <p> Tiona Mitchell , 18 , a senior at International Studies Academy who lives in the Western Addition , said it was unfair that so many predominantly African American schools were targeted . <p> " I think it 's unsafe , " Mitchell said . " We want to stay in the communities we live in and grew up in . They ( the board ) do n't understand because they do n't live near us . They live in nice neighborhoods . " <p> Omar Khalif , a resident of Bayview-Hunters Point with four children in the schools , told The Chronicle he is helping organize a withdrawal from the schools by African American families . He said the children would instead go to charter schools , private schools and schools run by African American churches . <p> " If we have to fight to be educated in 2006 , I think that 's a shame , " he said . " If they 're going to do what they 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take drastic measures ourselves . " <p> Several board members said they had hoped the city would provide the emergency funds to give the district more time to develop a long-range , more thoughtful plan . <p> Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi introduced legislation at the Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday that would give the schools $5.3 million in the form of a cash advance on Proposition H funds , which were approved by voters in 2004 for arts , music , librarians , sports , preschool and other classroom purposes . <p> The supervisors will vote on the measure Tuesday at the earliest . But board members decided Thursday night that even if the money became available they would not use it , partly because it was not earmarked for keeping schools open , and they fear voters would be swayed against future school measures . <p> Empty desks <p> Enrollment compared to capacity in S.F. schools <p> As of Oct. 2 , 2005 ' 05- ' 06 enrollment <p> School 's capacity <p> Malcolm X Academy Elementary <p> 350 Harbor Rd . <p> 45% <p> Gloria R.
