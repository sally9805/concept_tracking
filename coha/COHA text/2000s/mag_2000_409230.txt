With Toshiba and Sony televisions broadcasting news of East Timor in the den , sushi and sashimi shimmering on the raku dinner plate , Kias and Hondas purring in the garage , feng shui balancing the living room , and ikat , batik and shibori fabrics filling the closet , what part of our lives has n't been touched ? As guest curator for " Asian Persuasion : Contemporary Works with Asian Influence , " at the Gayle Willson Gallery in Southampton , New York ( November 2o-januarY 3 ) , my purpose was to explore the impact of Asian aesthetics on artists in the United States . I was interested in how even a single aspect of Asian art-form , technique , material , color or concept-could serve as the point of departure for a contemporary western work . And though many American artists find inspiration in the Far East , I narrowed my choices to colleagues in the San Francisco Bay Area , where exposure to Asian influences has been pronounced . Eighteen of the 22 artists selected live and work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first met them . About half are of Asian heritage . Ceramics , woodwork and metal sculpture were included in the exhibition , but fiber dominated : paper , baskets , wall cloths and wearables . Many of the show 's participants belong to a long and fruitful line of textile art makers emanating from the decorative arts and design departments at the University of California at Berkeley and Davis , and the California College of Arts and Crafts beginning in the 195os and 6os . Fiberworks Center for the Textile Arts and Pacific Basin School of Textile Art , where many of us continued to take and teach textile-related classes , were additional focal points for the fiber art movement in the 197os and 8os . ( Fiberworks and Pacific Basin closed in the late 8os ) In the design department at LIC Davis during the 197os , Katherine Westphal and Jo Ann Stabb were mentors to Lois Hadfield , Carol Lee Shanks and myself , among many students . Stabb continues to teach there and has seen Keiki Fujita , Carol Nakaso and Adele Zhang pass through as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exhibitors studied in the Far East with master craftsmen : Gary Holt , ceramics ( Japan and Korea ) ; Keiki Fujita , musen yuzen fabric painting ( Japan ) ; Ana Lisa Hedstrom , arashi shibori fabric dyeing ( Japan ) ; Lisa Lee Peterson , weaving ( China ) ; Susan Jamart , plaiting ( India and Polynesia ) ; Coille Hooven , ceramics ( China ) ; and Kimi Masui , ceramics ( Japan ) . Minako Bennett and Adele Zhang originally trained as designers for the garment industry in their native Japan and China , respectively . The 10 makers of wearables share a love of geometry that is so strong a design element in the Japanese kimono and its derivatives , the Korean hanbok , Chinese robes and the non-wrapped garments of India , Tibet and Indochina . Yet these artists are not bound by the cultural traditions that rigidly dictate a garment 's color , sleeve length , pattern and fiber content depending on the wearer . The spirit of their garments blossoms into new forms . Carol Lee Shanks reveres the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric is never cut away when one builds a kimono ; it is folded and hidden in the collar band or stitched into tucks . Shanks finds every thread its own place as she molds Kathryn Alexander 's hand-spun , dyed and woven fabric . The outermost vestment tops several layers of textured silk undergarments : tunic , pantaloons , vest and skirt . Sometimes a single ensemble comprises six or seven layers in as many colors , again resembling the kimono , which historically has been worn with many layers . Working with cheesecloth , Adele Zhang translates sharp contours and surface manipulations into " whisper " clothes that address her status as a new immigrant . She expresses the flexibility she senses in the United States but at the same time suggests the weight of time she carries from Chinese traditions . Minako Bennett creates western curve-with-the body suit jackets out of Japanese shibori ( tie-dye ) which she pieces with handwoven fabrics for a collage effect ; the shibori is set off by the other fabrics as it falls in a fluid swath from shoulder to hem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , span wrist to wrist across the back of a kimono , Katherine Westphal spreads birds or ginkgo leaves across her two hipparis ( Japanese short jacket ) , which she titles Yamadori and Ginkgodori . First she makes dozens of palm-sized pieces of paper by hand , each of which she covers with images of birds or ginkgo leaves . These images are color photocopied from actual shibori fabric onto transfer paper which is applied to the handmade fragments . She then dip-dyes , crinkles and distresses these papers until they resemble supple glove leather ( a similar technique- minus the photocopying-is employed by Buddhist monks when making ritual paper garments ) , and stitches them together to form panels of repeated , dancing images . Woven cotton cloth is the flexible interface between the paper panels , raising an important question : Are the hipparis permanent or temporary ? The layered , translucent apparel in Jo Ann Stabb 's Pacif k Rims series mines her extensive knowledge of costume history , personal adornment and the wearable art movement . Even though Icon Garment-Pacific Rims #2 is unmistakably a Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mylar is unconventional . Inserting a Chinese checkers game board in place of the traditional rank badge , Stabb playfully suggests that Izod , Gap and Nike are merely following the ancient Chinese in the use of clothing insignia to mark social class . Ana Lisa Hedstrom , Keiki Fujita and Lois Hadfield began dyeing silk according to established Japanese methods , but each has taken her craft beyond the traditional . Although the three transform their sumptuous silk paintings into clothing , they also showcase their work in large wall cloths and scarves . Hedstrom uses the arashi shibori technique , in which fabric is folded , wrapped and pleated on a shibori pole . The manipulations cause certain areas to resist the dye . Hadfield has originated a contemporary form of this process that bypasses use of the pole . Her wall piece , a three-panel cascade of color gradations , alludes to the classic three-panel noren that hangs in Japanese doorways . For Hedstrom , piecing is a way to arrange her intricately dyed silks in ways that surprise the viewer with juxtaposed color and asymmetrical shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper is customarily used in Japan as a cut-work stencil for the application of resist paste to fabric before dyeing . Repeated small designs produce an overall pattern the length of the yardage . Carol Nakaso cuts mulberry paper in larger images that tell a story-a gesturing sumo wrestler , a line of laundry hanging from an apartment building . In her hands , the paper , no longer merely a tool , becomes the finished piece . Margaret Dorfman builds her works slice by slice from edibles , then shapes them into " parchment " vessels : luminescent watermelon bowls , transparent star fruit and papaya baskets , glowing beet basins . In the Japanese aesthetic tradition of Wabi-Sabi - finding beauty in humble things- she employs the seasonal offerings of the produce market and extends their moment of exquisite perfection . In a single suitcase Susan Wick displays 16 " Japonesque " booksnew volumes bound with fabric covers in the stitched-cord method prevalent in Asia . She also clothes old books by sewing cloth bindings to the spines and individual pages , partially covering the Chinese text . " Reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Basketmakers Susan Jamart and Hisako Sekijima bring different approaches to their craft . Jamart applies a " mad weave " plaiting technique from the Philippines to a joyful array of grosgrain ribbons . Sekijima discovers her materials in the fields and under trees , then braids , coils or weaves intuitively to restructure these fragments of nature . Contemplating the stylized depictions of the natural world in many eastern art traditions , Darcy Falk renders landscape abstractly in her quilted wall pieces . And Leslie Correll 's study of Japanese ikebana ( flower arranging ) led her to construct a family of spirited vessels , each a collage of wood , paper , metal and wire . Chinese beads , toggles , hairpins and other artifacts stimulate Fumiko Ukai to build neckpieces of understated elegance . Demonstrating her reverence for the ancient components , she constructs patchwork bags to house the pieces when they are not worn . But showing a more playful side , she skirts a color taboo by sometimes sewing into the mix the reds and pinks mandated for children but forbidden to older women in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terse style of haiku poetry in their compact size and exacting format meant to capture a moment in time . A similar ephemeral quality is found in Dennis Morinaka 's bamboo Seasonal Table , in which leaves pinned under a glass insert can be changed . By exploring the venerable aesthetic components of Asian cultures , these artists have extended and expanded varied traditions . The processes serve as grounding in the face of tumultuous social change and a stepping stone to a future of ever greater creative flow between East and West .
