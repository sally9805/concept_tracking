<p> THE Texas governor 's race has turned into a potentially wild , winner-take-all battle from which the victor is likely to emerge with less than half the vote . <p> Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn dramatically changed the dynamics of the contest last week when she dropped her Republican primary challenge to Gov . Rick Perry to run as an independent . <p> She joined satirist Kinky Friedman in the quest for the independents , the disgusted and the disinterested voters of Texas . To get on the ballot , both will have to gather valid signatures from 45,450 registered voters during a 60-day window this spring , a feat most political experts expect them to achieve . <p> If they make it , the November general election will consist of Perry , Strayhorn , Friedman , the Democratic nominee and a Libertarian nominee . <p> " If you 're a political junkie , you 're in heaven right now , " said Dean Barkley , the campaign manager for Friedman . " Everyone will be watching this race . I guarantee you this will be the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 36 percent of the state 's registered voters turn out in a governor 's contest . But this one could push turnout to the levels of 1990 , when half the state 's voters cast ballots in an election that put Democrat Ann Richards in the Governor 's Mansion in an upset over Republican Clayton Williams . <p> All told , 15 candidates filed for governor this year with one of the parties or as an independent . <p> Of that group , political experts think there will be four viable candidates : Perry , Strayhorn , Friedman and the Democratic nominee - a designation currently sought by two front-running candidates , former U.S. Rep. Chris Bell and former Texas Supreme Court Justice Bob Gammage . <p> That the winner is likely to have less than half the vote will not be unusual . Richards in 1990 and Democrat Dolph Briscoe in 1972 won the governor 's race with less than a majority . Strayhorn won the comptroller 's office in 1998 with 49.5 percent of the vote . <p> What would be unusual would be for an independent or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bull Moose Party ran the strongest national third-party campaign in U.S. history in 1912 , taking 27 percent of the national vote in his losing bid . <p> Independent presidential candidate Ross Perot contributed to the 1992 defeat of President George H.W. Bush by taking 19 percent of the vote . <p> Perot was the strongest independent candidate in modern Texas history , taking 22 percent of the state vote . But Bush still carried Texas by winning 40.5 percent of the popular vote . Democrat Bill Clinton received 37 percent . <p> Jesse " The Body " Ventura , a former professional wrestler and actor , surprised the nation by winning the Minnesota governor 's race in 1998 . But the last independent to win the Texas governor 's office was Sam Houston in 1859 . <p> To handicap the race , the Houston Chronicle asked for input from the campaigns as well as several knowledgeable political observers . <p> Mike Baselice : Pollster for Perry <p> Baselice said he thinks Strayhorn 's decision to run as an independent increases Perry 's chances of re-election . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican-leaning state , " Baselice said . " There 's only so many disenchanted party loyalists who are willing to take a stab at an independent candidacy . " <p> Baselice said Texas has a base Republican vote of 50 percent and a base Democratic vote of 35 percent . He said if each party loses 5 percent of its vote and it is added to the independent , the swing vote just reaches 25 percent . <p> " If you gave it all to Strayhorn and none to Kinky , she 's still woefully short , " Baselice said . <p> He predicted Friedman 's campaign will be meaningless by Election Day because he will not have the money to mount a statewide television-advertising campaign . <p> " It cost $1.6 million to run a week of TV properly in Texas , " Baselice said . <p> Tom Pauken : Former Texas GOP chairman <p> Pauken said there is enough dissatisfaction with Republican voters about Perry 's administration and inability to pass a public school finance plan than either Strayhorn or the Democratic nominee can defeat Perry in a multicandidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry will be re-elected , " Pauken said . " He 's alienated a lot of Republicans . " <p> Pauken said gathering the signatures to get on the ballot may be a problem for Strayhorn . <p> " She does n't have a strong organization , and Friedman has been preparing for the past year for what you have to do to run as an independent , " Pauken said . <p> " Assuming she gets on the ballot , she can be a tough candidate in the fall . She hurts Perry , and she hurts him quite badly . " <p> Pauken said Strayhorn 's candidacy will be a big boost for the Democratic nominee because it increases the impact of the Democratic base vote in a divided turnout . <p> But he said Strayhorn has a shot at winning because voters have become disenchanted with both Republicans and Democrats . <p> " They 're angrier at the Republicans at the moment than the Democrats , but there 's a little bit of pox on both your houses , " Pauken said . <p> He said Strayhorn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails . <p> " I see him more as a protest vote or a joke . Now , with Strayhorn in the race , his hopes will fade dramatically , " Pauken said . <p> Brad McClellan : Stayhorn 's son and campaign manager <p> McClellan said Strayhorn knows it will be tough to win as an independent . <p> " It has been 147 years since this has been done , and Sam Houston probably needed fewer votes to win than we need signatures ( to get on the ballot ) , " McClellan said . <p> Houston won his 1859 race with 33,375 votes , according to Richard Rice , historical interpreter at the Sam Houston Memorial Museum in Huntsville . That 's 12,075 fewer voter signatures than Strayhorn and Friedman each need to get on the ballot . <p> McClellan said no one should discount the fact Strayhorn will be the only woman in a field of male candidates running for governor . <p> " It 's just another perspective . It 's that tough grandma . There are more females that vote in the general election than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> McClellan said his mother will take a large portion of the Democratic and independent vote as well as the Republican base because voters are " fed up " with both parties , particularly on issues such as educating children . <p> " We 're the one that 's going to win this race because we cut into that conservative base . And there 's a big base out there . There are people out there who say they 're tired of the labels , and they want to see stuff get done , " he said . <p> Jason Stanford : Bell 's chief consultant <p> Stanford said the complexity of building a voting bloc from Republicans , Democrats and independents will make it difficult for Strayhorn to win . <p> " There are too many cross- purposes . Before , it was simple : She needed to create a general election in a primary , " Stanford said . " Chris Bell 's challenge is to get Democrats to vote for the Democratic nominee . " <p> Stanford said Democratic nominee Tony Sanchez got 40 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote will be enough for the Democratic nominee to win in a multicandidate race against Perry . <p> " Everyone in this race is making a persuasive case to fire Rick Perry , " he said . <p> Stanford said the cost of a Democratic campaign will be less because it can target Democratic voters . He said the multicandidate race also will make it difficult for Perry to attack any one opponent with negative television commercials . <p> " If he puts up $5 million on TV against Chris Bell , none of those votes are going to go to him . They 're going to go to Carole Strayhorn or Kinky Friedman . His return on that dollar is marginal at best , " Stanford said . <p> The other candidates can go after Perry , though . <p> " This is n't a circular firing squad . We 're all pointed at Rick Perry , and he 's got to spend the entire time on defense . " <p> Dean Rindy : Gammage adviser <p> Rindy said he thinks the Democratic nominee will benefit from Perry and Strayhorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year as Perry tries to " crush " Strayhorn 's ability to build momentum . <p> " While the two dinosaurs thrash about in the jungle , we can remain relatively unscathed for the midpart of the campaign year , " Rindy said in a memo to Gammage supporters . " We will hammer home our message to hold our base , while looking far cleaner than our two Republican rivals . " <p> Rindy said Strayhorn 's independent campaign will finish off Friedman . <p> " She simply sucks the air out of Kinky 's message , hogs the media spotlight , steps on his story line and makes it very difficult for him to attract significant numbers of Perot-type conservatives , " he said . <p> Rindy said the Texas governor 's race is developing into a contest like the 1992 presidential contest when Bush barely carried Texas despite Perot 's insurgent campaign . <p> " Bush Sr. barely scraped by in that election , and Rick Perry is not George Bush , " Rindy said . " Her image as an independent is much weaker than Perot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Democratic voters . " <p> Dean Barkley : Friedman 's campaign manager <p> Barkley ran Ventura 's surprise independent victory in Minnesota . He said Friedman can replicate it in Texas . <p> " It 's real simple . What an independent candidate has to do to win is they have to motivate the traditional nonvoting public , or disgruntled voters who have stopped voting , to return to the polls to vote , " Barkley said . <p> " If Carole could pull off the illusion that she is really an independent , it could make it more difficult for us . The jury is out on whether Carole has the qualities to motivate nonvoting people to vote . I know Kinky can . " <p> Barkley said he thinks that in a three-way race the winner will need 40 percent of the vote . In a four-way race , he said the victor could take it with as little as 30 percent . <p> " There 's a lot of dissatisfaction with Perry among conservatives , " Barkley said . " Now that will be a battle between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go for . " <p> He said Friedman also will be able to appeal to Democrats on environmental issues and social libertarian stands such as supporting gay marriage . <p> Barkley said Texas voters also will see a difference in the contest in March and April during the 60 days when Strayhorn and Friedman are gathering signatures to get on the ballot . Both will need to collect about twice as many signatures as they need to guarantee they have enough valid signatures . <p> Valid signatures come from registered voters who cast no ballots in either party 's primary or runoffs . They also can not sign both the Strayhorn and Friedman petition . <p> " A lot of people are going to be bugged to put their signature on a petition . Make sure it 's the Kinky petition you sign , not the Strayhorn , " Barkley said . <p> NOT UNUSUAL <p> Winning with less than a majority : <p> 1972 : Democrat Dolph Briscoe won the governor 's race with 47.9 percent of the vote . <p> 1990 : Ann Richards won the governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Third parties and independents playing the role of protest vote : <p> In modern gubernatorial elections , they take 6 percent or less of the total voter turnout . <p> UNUSUAL <p> An independent or third-party candidate winning : <p> 1859 : The last independent to become Texas governor was Sam Houston . <p> 1912 : Former President Theodore Roosevelt 's Bull Moose Party took 27 percent of the national vote in his losing bid . <p> 1992 : Independent presidential candidate Ross Perot contributed to the defeat of former President Bush by taking 19 percent of the popular vote . <p> NOTES : r.g.ratcliffe@chron.com 1 .

ASSOCIATED PRESS FILE @x IT 'S MIDDAY ON A RECENT Tuesday , and Rachael Irwin , 27 , scurries across the floor on her hands and knees , playing peekaboo with her 10-month-old daughter , Gabriella . The baby 's big blue eyes dance with delight . Like many children her age , Gabriella is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gabriella is in prison . She and her mother are participating in the Bedford Hills ( N.Y. ) Correctional Facility 's nursery program , one of only nine programs in the country that allow incarcerated women to keep their babies with them after they give birth . Nationwide , nearly 2 million children have parents in prison . The number of those with incarcerated mothers , in particular , is growing exponentially : A recent report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the number of minors with mothers in prison increased by more than 100 percent in the last 15 years . " These children are sort of victims by default , " says Paige Ransford , research assistant at the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts ( UMass ) Boston , and coauthor of the recent report " Parenting from Prison . " Most of the children go live with grandparents or other relatives ; one in 10 is placed in foster care . About half are separated from their siblings . These children are prone to a whole host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peers to be in trouble with the law later in life . In the case of women who enter the system as mothers-to-be , the usual excitement of pregnancy is replaced with a sense of dread . The choices that , on the outside , are understood to be a woman 's right-such as where and how to give birth , and whether or not to breastfeed-are transferred from the woman to bureaucrats and officers at the state Department of Corrections ( DOC ) . Of the 115,308 women incarcerated in the U.S. as of 2007 , some 4,000 women-4 percent of women in state custody and 3 percent in federal-were pregnant when they entered prison . In the vast majority of cases , babies are removed from their mothers immediately after birth and placed with relatives or in foster care . However , a small but growing number of states are recognizing that the mother-child bond formed in the first few months of life is crucial to the child 's development , and that the bond need not be broken . " We 're definitely seeing more states grapple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of whom are pregnant , " says Sarah From , director of public policy and communications for the Women 's Prison Association ( WPA ) and coauthor of the agency 's forthcoming report on prison nurseries . Eight states now have some sort of program to house female offenders together with their newborns , the newest being Indiana . The West Virginia legislature recently passed a bill establishing a program in its correctional facility for women , which is slated to open in 2009 . These programs vary widely in the length of time babies are allowed to stay with their incarcerated mothers and in the services provided while they 're in prison with them . South Dakota 's program allows babies to stay for just 30 days-with the mother in her regular cell-while Washington state allows children to stay for up to three years with their mothers in a separate wing of the prison . The Washington facility offers a federal Early Head Start program for prenatal health and infant-toddler development , and partners with the nonprofit Prison Doula Project to provide doula services to the women during and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison was a state reformatory , the Bedford Hills Program is the oldest and largest in the country , with its own nursery wing and space for up to 29 mother-baby pairs . Women live with their babies in bright rooms stuffed with donated toys and clothes . During the day , while the women attend DOC-mandated drug counseling , anger management , vocational training and parenting classes , their children attend a day care staffed by inmates who have graduated from an intensive two-year Early Childhood Associate vocational training program . Although the idea of babies living the first months of their lives behind bars is sad to contemplate , many experts say that the alternative-separating them from their mothers-is far worse . " If a woman is serving a short sentence and can look forward to a life with her child ... so much research addresses the importance of that early bonding relationship , " says Sylvia Mignon , associate professor and director of the graduate program in human services at UMass Boston and coauthor , with Ransford , of the " Parenting from Prison " report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is in prison . All she knows is that she 's getting the warmth and love and attention of this wonderful being called mom . " Among women serving sentences of more than a decade , however , there is no clear consensus on what 's best for the child ; the Bedford Hills program generally only accepts women serving sentences of five years or less . " We do n't want to create a bond that 's guaranteed to be broken , " says the children 's center program director , Bobby Blanchard . Unlike in the general prison population , doors in the program are never locked ; inmates must be able to come and go freely in order to warm bottles , do laundry and comfort crying children out of the earshot of other sleeping babies . Rooms are decorated with photographs and handmade posters that say things like , " Loving yourself is something to be proud of ! " Danielizz Negron , 23 , rocks her 4-month-old son , Jeremiah , while he naps in a stroller . She was six months pregnant when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted a plea deal and turned herself in . " If I had not known about this program , I would not have came in . I would 've been in Mexico somewhere by now , " she says , only half-joking . As the number of prison nurseries continues to grow , some caution against becoming overly sanguine . Prison nurseries are wonderful programs , says the WPA 's Sarah From , however " we should n't be looking to build more prison nurseries , but rather work in the community to put less women in prison .
