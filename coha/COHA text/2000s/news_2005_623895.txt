<p> Solano County 's hidden housing crisis <p> Editor  --  Solano County 's hidden housing problem is coming to light ( " Solano 's hidden homeless , " Nov. 13 ) . <p> Just last week , the lack of affordable places to live in Solano County 's cities was highlighted in a report by the Solano Housing Coalition , Greenbelt Alliance and Non-Profit Housing of Northern California . " Through the Roof : Solano County 's Housing Crisis " highlighted the disparity between homes being built and what local people can afford . In January , 80 percent of Solano residents could not afford the local median home price ( which has since risen by $100,000 ) . <p> Solano County 's housing crisis is hidden by the county 's rampant housing development . But large , single-family houses built on the region 's outskirts are not meeting our needs . We need more housing options for everyone , including the chronically homeless , the working poor and the struggling middle class . <p> Solano County 's cities can start solving the hidden problem of homeless by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . <p> SANDY CARSON <p> Solano Housing Coalition <p> Fairfield <p> Stem-cell research <p> Editor  --  Regarding " Science and democracy " ( Editorial , Nov. 13 ) : Sunday 's editorial attacking California 's new stem-cell research program might better be titled , " Science , democracy and scandal-mongering . " <p> Proposition 71 was sold to the public as a way to fund stem-cell research . That is what was offered , that is what California voted for , that is what the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine is working so hard to provide . Despite lawsuits and gutter-low attacks on the characters of good and decent people , that struggle goes forward . <p> There are problems , of course . Anything new brings change , and those who oppose any aspect of the stem-cell program have the right to speak up . But legitimate differences should be raised  --  not reduced to attacks . <p> Real-life difficult issues , such as intellectual property , are being worked on by the Independent Citizens Oversight Committee , and worked on hard . But do n't take my word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upcoming meetings " for time and place . <p> I have attended almost all 50 public sessions of the ICOC , and they are long , tiring for all participants and wonderful to behold . The committee members are all tops in their field , and they essentially volunteer . They get paid only $100 a day for the actual meetings and zero for the hours it takes for them to read and digest the mountains of material for every agenda item . <p> Proposition 71 was begun by direct democracy . It represents the unvarnished will of the people of California . <p> We want the research to go forward , to alleviate suffering and bring cures . <p> Everything else is just a distraction . <p> DON C. REED , co-chair <p> Californians for Cures <p> Fremont <p> Misjudging the jihad <p> Editor  --  Your lead article in the Nov. 13 Insight section , by John Arquilla , is headlined , " Misjudging the jihad , " and subheaded , " Like their leader , bin Laden 's lieutenants are well-educated , well-traveled and well-heeled . " <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Rep. Lynn Woolsey , who surely has better sources of information than Arquilla . She proposes a policy that " aggressively invests in the development of impoverished nations to address the root causes of terrorism . " In other words , we solve terrorism by solving poverty . Because most of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorists were from Saudi Arabia , it follows that we should aggressively invest there to solve their poverty . <p> BOB KOCH <p> Novato <p> Darfur genocide <p> Editor  --  Although the nonstop genocide in Darfur , Sudan , has not been reported on The Chronicle 's front-page recently , it continues to claim at least 500 innocent people a day . Dispatching its proxy militia , the Janjaweed , to conduct scorched-earth attacks on civilians , the Sudanese government defies all critics . The United Nations ' undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs calls this " the worst humanitarian crisis in the world . " <p> Efforts to stop the violence and to protect civilians from future attacks have been ineffective . Experts on the scene blame the limited number of African Union troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaccessibility of many of Darfur 's villages . The single biggest reason for the inaction is the lack of political will . <p> What can the international community do , especially the United States , to stop this needless tragedy ? Insist that your elected officials support a stronger U.S. contribution to the African Union to significantly increase troop strength in Darfur . Tell them that there must be enforcing of " no fly zones " and sanctions already specified in U.N . Security Council resolutions and the establishing of a secure environment for delivery of humanitarian aid . Ask that we increase NATO logistical airlift support and combat unspeakable sexual violence against young girls and mothers . <p> There is a clear legal and moral imperative to halt the brutal killings and displacement in Darfur . Our humanity is at stake and time is running out . <p> STEVEN KORNETSKY , president <p> KELLY RAMOT , associate director <p> American Jewish Committee <p> San Francisco Bay Area Chapter <p> The condom club <p> Editor  --  Cheers to Berkeley High School for creating the Condom Club ( " Berkeley High 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male , who wants to be sexually active and is not willing or able to financially and emotionally support a child until he or she is 18 , should certainly join the club . Likewise any female . Contraception is between two people . It makes no difference who brings the condoms . Condoms are about family planning ; abortions are about unwanted children . <p> MAYFLOWER DAY BRANDT <p> Berkeley <p>  --  ' Winning ' ways Editor  --  Chronicle cartoonist George Russell 's Nov. 13 editorial cartoon showing the developer 's bulldozer " winning " at Bay Meadows was brilliant . <p> However , it was also clearly unfinished . It failed to show the San Mateo City Council pouring gas into the tank and San Mateo 's special-interest groups pushing and pulling the bulldozer . That 's the way San Mateo runs a horse race . <p> DONNA M. BISCHOFF , member <p> Save Bay Meadows <p> San Mateo <p> Questions on Hetch Hetchy <p> Editor  --  Regarding Don Hodel 's Nov. 13 Open Forum article , " Why we must restore Hetch Hetchy " : There have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory . <p> I am a member of the Yosemite-Mono Lake Paiute Indian community who once resided in camps along the Hetch Hetchy . We Paiutes would like to know what would happen after restoration ? How long would it take to see the valley return to its natural state ? Who would be in charge of taking care of our valley ? Who would be the stewards of Hetch Hetchy ? What would happen to the waters of the Tuolumne River that feed into the Don Pedro Reservoir ? Would there be a visitors ' center with vehicles entering Hetch Hetchy Valley daily ? <p> Those are questions that we , the original owners , would like answered regarding the restoration of Hetch Hetchy . <p> ROGER SALAS <p> Yosemite-Mono Lake <p> Paiute Indian Community <p> Sacramento <p> Editor  --  I marvel at the insouciance with which Don Hodel announces the inevitability of returning Hetch Hetchy to nature at enormous and unspecified cost . As a Peninsula consumer of Hetch Hetchy water , I see that the system is here , it works , it 's pure , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source will not be secure because it will not be in the city 's domain . <p> Water is a scarce natural resource that has already been allocated in this state : Just 10 percent of Central Valley Project farms get two-thirds of its water . Do you suppose these well-financed and politically influential users will readily share their water with non-farmers in San Francisco as demand continues to increase ? Ferocious water wars lie ahead . Keep Hetch Hetchy intact . <p> JAN WELLS <p> Redwood City ( 1 ) Houseless : " Wings " is one of Solano County 's homeless . / Brant Ward/The Chronicle , ( 2 ) Quincy Stivers , left , and brother Aiden toss stones into Hetch Hetchy Reservoir . / Shelley Eades/Special to The Chronicle
