Ashla stood shivering in the darkened streets of Times Square . <p> She was almost used to the total lack of light , and even the eerie absence of sound in a city that ought to have been clamoring with noise , but what she could n't adjust to was the absolute barrenness of humanity . <p> How long had she been in this surreal , postapocalyptic version of New York ? Had it been a week ? Three ? She had lost track . One of the most populous cities in America , and she had yet to see a single soul besides herself . <p> Ashla was a bit hazy on some of the details of when this all had come about , of how and why the world had blossomed into this bizarre , barren landscaping , but she did recall her initial reaction of pure panic . She remembered quite clearly the act of running around to all of the places where coworkers , friends , and even family were supposed to be . <p> Queens . The Bronx . Eastern Long Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . <p> Oh , everything worked all right . Subways . Cars . Machinery . All of it as if the regular occupants of the world would return any moment to pick up and go on just as they always had . Only , there were some strange details missing . There was no television reception or projection . Lightbulbs , neon lights , and anything providing the smallest glimmer of illumination refused to perform their designated functions . That had truly freaked her out in the beginning . The lack of light had made the vast vacant spaces of the city seem somehow claustrophobic and paralyzing . It had gotten better , thank goodness , as her eyes had adapted to the total darkness with a surprising rapidity . She had even grown accustomed to the fact that it always remained nighttime and never turned to day like it should . <p> Things had definitely improved once she stopped thinking of reasons why there might not be a sun . <p> Another odd thing was the food . Food was always fresh for the taking , somehow replenishing itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stocking and rotating it . She never saw any of it happen , it just did . <p> In the end , she had realized that the ideal course of action was to not spend too much time thinking about the details . She never got answers when she did , and only managed to scare herself witless in the process . Explanations escaped her for those and many other anomalous details , but she was weary of the constant heart-racing panic that overwhelmed her every time she thought too hard about her shadowed environs . Instead , she learned to enjoy things ... like foods she 'd never tried before , or sneaking into homes in Chinatown just to see how different they were . <p> There was one light , however . Moonlight . It was the one and only relief to the dark world . The growing cycle of the moon , with its inevitable turn toward fullness , would shed more and more beautifully pale light onto the world around her . Ashla did n't even mind all the spooky shadows it cast in long black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding in them . <p> In fact , her reality remained completely devoid of humanity , just as it had for the better part of a month now . Two months ? More ? Even time seemed to have given up on this lifeless wasteland that made no sense to her . She supposed she had given up as well , eventually trudging away from the overwhelming grief over lost loved ones and even abandoning her furious frustration at her suddenly senseless world . Now she simply wandered New York and the rest of the tri-state area trying to amuse herself . <p> Until then , she had never realized how vital the presence of others could be to a person 's sanity . <p> It had actually been fun for a little while , walking paths and places that were normally so heavily protected by security or warning signs , and examining all the strange inner workings of things she 'd never questioned before . At least , it had been fun until she had taken a bad fall in a subway station and it had occurred to her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one around to help her ; no one to rush her to a hospital for care ; no one to care enough to keep her from rotting away from hunger and thirst alone in a dark , tiled tunnel . <p> She had n't gone belowground since that particular panic attack . Aboveground might not necessarily be less hazardous , but it was far less enclosing and she took comfort in whatever she could at that point . Ashla 's sense of security on the open streets was relative . She was safe from dark , creepy subterranean dangers , perhaps , but she was also left feeling even more alone as towering buildings soared above her , miniaturizing her and making her feel as though she were standing at the bottom of a great abandoned canyon . She had struggled with the ever-increasing fear that someday something might happen and she would n't know what to do to help herself . <p> And then sometimes , some very awful bad times , she could n't even remember all the names of the people she knew . It was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bottom of her soul terrified . Because those were the times when she feared she had simply lost her mind . After all , what other explanation could there be ? What could possibly make her forget her beloved sister Cristine ? Or even her brothers Malcolm and Joseph ? Her parents . It horrified her to think there was anything that could make her forget what it had been like to grow up in her mother 's care . <p> She took comfort that today she remembered it all , and tried not to worry about tomorrow . <p> Other than all of that ... <p> New York City was her playground . <p> Saks . Barneys . Macy 's . Bloomies . Granted , they would have been more fun if there had been some decent light to see by , but she compensated for it by shopping close to windows that filled with moonlight . She walked in whenever she wanted and walked out without needing to pay . Every day she picked a new store to get dressed in . She 'd amused herself enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diamond District , but now she was gravitating back to the retro boutiques she had always loved . She liked the priceless vintage dresses , lace and beads and hand-worked details that were so rare in the modern world . So she made her way to her favorite shop and , before long , was slipping into an ivory gown with a tautly stitched empire waist , a la Jane Austen . It had a silk underlining and hand-crocheted lace over it in a perfect pastel cream . It was unique , delicate and beautiful , the style transporting her back to a time when men fought duels for the honor of a woman . <p> That was when she heard the first resonant clang of metal on metal . <p> She was so startled by the sound after so much silence that she threw herself against a wall and hid , her breath panting and her heart pounding for a full minute before working up the courage to sneak to the window . <p> " Something probably dropped . Toppled over . You 're just being a ninny , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , right up until the moment she heard the second crash of metal against metal , the clang reverberating in the dim world and vacant streets . Understanding crystallized when she heard the hard sound of running feet coming toward her , and she strained to somehow hide and see what was going on all at the same time . <p> She glimpsed the dark shape of a man an instant before a second man plowed up into him and they both came flying toward her . Ashla ducked with a scream and barely got her arms up protectively before they barreled through the plate glass window in a shower of shards . Clothing racks and tables disintegrated as they broke the momentum of the two large-bodied fighting men . A sword , of all things , went skidding across the hardwood flooring , bumping to a stop against Ashla 's bare toes . <p> " Oh , yeah , Ash , you are definitely swimming in the deep end now , " she muttered to herself as she stared down at the weapon . A sword . Not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to realize she had never given her imagination enough credit until she had gone crazy . Now she had to admit that the sword was a neat touch to her little fantasy world . So were the men , for that matter . <p> She watched with dismay as they grappled with each other on the floor amongst the inventory and glass debris . They were both dark-skinned and had dark coloring . The larger man kept his hair long , whipped back tightly into a plait , the jet color of it gleaming in the weak moonlight filtering into the store . His brawny build filled out his clothing almost to test the integrity of his seams . Denim jeans in black hugged tightly to thickly muscled thighs , biker boots holding his braced feet in place against the floor . His shoulders bulged against the dark gray cotton of his dress shirt , and a necklace of some kind dangled almost tauntingly against the disadvantaged man 's cheek below him as they struggled for ownership of the remaining sword . <p> " Give up ! " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know I will win this ! " <p> " I 'd rather kiss the sun , " was the gruff , straining reply from the slimmer man . It was true , Ashla observed with concern , that the other man was outweighed and , while of impressive physique himself from what she could tell , he was also outmuscled . This one 's hair was close-cropped at the back of his neck and around his ears , but there was a little bit of length to the top as it fell back to reveal a widow 's peak . The curve of his hairline made his squared jaw and prominent cheekbones appear deeply exotic . The ebony sheen of his wildly tossed hair set shadows on his already dark eyes , making him appear just a little wicked in his features . The impression deepened as he gave his opponent a slow , amused grin that belied his struggle to keep hold of his weapon . " Give it up , Baylor . You 'll not win this . Not today ! " <p> The observation was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's braced legs , caught him hard , and sent him flying ass over shoulders above the other man 's head . Baylor 's back slammed into the floor , forcing a startled cough from him . Free of his opponent , the other man scrambled to his feet but did little more than stagger up against a nearby counter . His sword hung tiredly from one hand , the tip grazing the ground . He raised the back of a broad hand to his nose , which , Ashla realized , was bleeding . For all his determination and bravado , it was clear even to her that he was exhausted and had taken a serious beating . Despite the dusk of his skin tone , she could see the swelling and color of new bruises appearing on his face and battered knuckles . <p> The one named Baylor was on the floor groaning , trying to recover from a hard shot in the testicles that had to hurt even more than when a woman delivered it . Most men would consider the maneuver fighting dirty , but the weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ashla did n't blame him in the least for resorting to such a brutal tactic . <p> " You ... dare ... to betray ... our people , " the standing man gasped between difficult-to-draw breaths . He was hugging an arm to his side , his ribs obviously hurting him , and Ashla found herself actually worrying that he had broken one or more . She did n't even know him , or what they were fighting about , so why , she wondered , was she starting to show concern for one side over the other ? <p> " There was a time when you were considered the traitor , Ajai Trace , " Baylor growled . " History is written by the one who wins the coup . " <p> Baylor rolled over onto his hands and knees , panting hard and groaning beneath his breath as his movements sent obvious reminders of pain through his reproductive system . He looked up and suddenly Ashla found herself staring into deep eyes of black and menace . But as bad as the scowl initially was , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Well , well . What have we here ? " <p> The snide speculation made Ashla cringe , but instincts she did n't understand caused her to lay her shaking fingers to rest against the grip of the sword by her toes . She was n't going to use it , just ... she would make sure it stayed out of his easy reach . Her gaze shifted to the other male and she was surprised and unexplainably grateful to see he had straightened and , as though in no pain at all , swiftly grabbed up his own sword and slid sturdily into the space between Baylor and herself . <p> " Come now , Trace , " Baylor drawled slowly as the other man 's blade tapped its tip to the jutting point of his chin . The implication was clear . One wrong move and his head would be singing farewell to his neck . " Look at the fear in her eyes . Look at how the Lost one trembles . Do n't you get it ? It means she can see us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind . Everyone in their world knew well enough that the Lost could n't see a Shadowdweller . There was one exception , but even that required a ritual , a priest , and a damn good reason to want to make that kind of contact , which on its own was a preposterous likelihood . Still , Trace had glimpsed the cowering Lost girl shortly after they had come in through the window . Her reaction at the time would be understandable . She could n't see them , but she would certainly see the exploding glass coming toward her . <p> Trace let his gaze flick to his low right and back again , taking a quick mental picture of the female . It was impossible to miss her , really . She was everything his people were n't . Fair . Blond . Wearing white . Fearful . In fact , he could n't seem to help himself as he looked back at her once more , getting a better look at just how light and white she seemed . Even her eyes were bright and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they were staring straight at him . <p> Wide , frightened , but inarguably fixated on him . <p> " Impossible , " he muttered aloud . <p> " Ha ! Proof of your idiotic stubbornness , " Baylor mocked him . <p> " You will shut your treacherous mouth , my friend , " Trace ground out angrily , using the press of his blade on Baylor 's throat to force the other man to sit upright onto his heels . Even despite his quick obedience , the highly honed tip of the blade cut into his skin and started a river of blood flowing down his thick throat . As for Trace , his roaring temper had shifted from betrayed anger to a storm of fury . " Do you think this is how this will end ? Do you really think I will merely take you into my custody and march you to your fate at the hands of my regents ? After you follow me here to engage my ear in whispered plots and backstabbing sedition meant to pit one regent against the other ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Trace assured in a voice that ground to a low and slow resonance of threat , " I am my Lord Chancellor 's vizier , and it is I who advises him , but while I would have you hanged publicly to be made an example of , Tristan would not see you as the threat you truly are . <p> " His Grace , " he continued bitterly , " suffers from the overconfidence of power and strength . A flaw only time will rectify . Also , there is his unshakable foundation of his trust in his sister 's loyalty , a factor which makes him laugh off plot-makers like you . It is a mistake many young regents have made . He forgets that voices like yours will always find the ears of the discontented and disloyal whether they succeed at their intended goal or not . <p> " Their reign is far too youthful to be given such a test , and our efforts at peace with the other Nightwalkers would distract him from realizing that . So no , " Trace assured the kneeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will end with my sword severing those seditious vocal cords of yours and keeping you from ever whispering your ill words to a single other ' Dweller . " <p> " It is against the law for one ' Dweller to take the life of another ! " Baylor reminded him with a sneer . " A law you instigated , if I recall ! How steady do you think this political body will ever be when its own lawmakers can not abide by its own rules ? " <p> " Do not quote my own laws to me , traitor , " Trace hissed through clenched teeth , pushing forward on his blade until Baylor squawked in protest . " Or do you forget that an attack on any of the ruling body is considered an act of treason and war ? In war , the law is suspended with circumstance and proof of cause . " Trace leaned forward to close the distance between their gazes . " Do you forget the dagger you plunged into my back so soon ? " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
