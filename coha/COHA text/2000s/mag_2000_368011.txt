NIGHTMARE Turns out youngsters have reason to fear the dark . Researchers in Europe have found that babies born at night are at greater risk of early death . Studying low-risk births , they learned that infants born between 9 p.m. and 6:59 a.m. were almost twice as likely to die in the first few weeks of life as babies born during the day . A likely cause : hospital-staff fatigue during night shifts . <P> GENDER INEQUALITY By age 4 1/2 , boys usually display better spatial skills and reasoning than girls of the same age  --  skills that are used later in life to do math and read maps . Researchers have long believed this difference is largely biological . But recent studies have shown that while biology does play a role , the nurture factor can not be discounted . In daily play girls are n't encouraged as much as boys to engage in such spatially oriented activities as playing with blocks and puzzles . <P> HIS BIOLOGICAL CLOCK Despite disturbing evidence to the contrary ( i.e. , Larry King , Tony Randall ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think . Scientists have discovered that male fertility  --  much like female  --  declines with age . The older a man is , the longer it takes his partner to conceive , irrespective of her age . The likelihood of a man impregnating a woman in a year of trying decreases 3% for every year after his 24th birthday . <P>  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
