<p> Dry Branch  --  Halfway through the Rolling Stones ' " Voodoo Lounge " tour in 1994 , lead singer Mick Jagger pulled keyboardist Chuck Leavell aside for some gentle chiding . <p> Jagger said Leavell was talking too much about trees during press interviews , and asked that he concentrate more on discussing the music . Leave the tree talk for another time , Jagger said . <p> " Mick was right , " Leavell recalls with a chuckle . " I get a little carried away when it comes to trees . " <p> Leavell 's dexterity on the keyboard and his vast musical repertoire have earned him international fame in the super-energized world of rock music , first with the Allman Brothers Band in the 1970s and then with the Stones , Eric Clapton , George Harrison and others . But it is his passion for trees that has earned the respect of his neighbors in Middle Georgia and tree growers across the nation . <p> Over the past two decades , between touring and recording , Leavell and his wife of 28 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twiggs County near Macon into a textbook tree-farming enterprise . <p> Leavell , 49 , has twice been named Outstanding Tree Farmer in Georgia and in 1999 was named the National Outstanding Tree Farmer . Since then , he has become a spokesman for the Georgia Forestry Association and the American Tree Farm System . <p> Today , he talks as excitedly about loblolly and slash pines as he does about being on stage with Jagger and Keith Richards . <p> " My friends say I am a tree farmer in my heart , " he says , " and a musician in my soul . " <p> Says Jagger : " Chuck is always talking about trees . . . . Sometimes , it drives me crazy . But his passion for forestry is undeniable , and he 's made some strong contributions to the environment through that passion . " <p> Leavell 's passion for trees and conservation also has prompted him to write a new book , " Forever Green , the History and Hope of the American Forest " ( $24.95 , Longstreet Press ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood is one of our most critical resources , one that must be wisely used and conscientiously renewed . " <p> Leavell 's willingness to speak to groups about the importance of tree farming has made him a hero of sorts among private forest landowners , many of whom call themselves the " unsung heroes " of the environmental movement . <p> Last month , testifying in Washington before a subcommittee considering programs for the 2002 farm bill , Leavell said many of the nation 's nearly 10 million private forest landowners are facing immense economic and environmental pressures . Developers , he said , are devouring the woodlands , and as suburbs sprawl outward , land values are soaring , and forests are more vulnerable to development . <p> The son of an insurance salesman , Leavell was born in Birmingham . When he was 6 , his family moved to a small farm near Montgomery , where he lived the life of a country boy  --  playing in the creeks , smelling the blooming honeysuckle , gazing with wonder at the stars , listening to gospel singers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was a very , very happy part of my childhood , " Leavell recalls . <p> It was about that time he also started playing the piano by imitating his piano-playing mother . She taught him to express his feelings and moods on the piano . <p> Ray Charles played a grand piano during a concert Leavell attended when he was 13 . " I was moved by the performance , and I knew then I wanted to be a musician , " he says . <p> Leavell says the " sound " that has made him such a highly sought-after artist is a melding of styles , a blend inspired by Ray Charles and other great music makers  --  the blues musicians who played on street corners and in dives across the South ; gospel singers , both black and white , he heard on the radio on Sunday mornings ; jazz artists like Chick Corea ; and rock pianists like Elton John and Leon Russell . <p> Consumed by his passion for music , Leavell dropped out of his senior year in high school and set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry was being born . In 1972 , his wildest dreams came true when he was asked to join the Allman Brothers Band . <p> He played keyboards with the Allmans for five years ( he plays the sparkling piano runs on the Allman hits " Jessica " and " Southbound " ) until the band temporarily disbanded in 1976 . Leavell then started his own band , the rock-jazz fusion group Sea Level . <p> It was at Capricorn he met Rose Lane White , a tall , self-assured woman who worked at the recording studio . " Her family was a little wary of me at first , " says Leavell , who retains his soft Alabama drawl . " Her daddy warned everyone that Rose Lane was bringing home a musician with long hair . " <p> He and Rose Lane married in June of 1973 . By 1980 , they had two daughters , and Leavell 's career was soaring . <p> A year later , the Leavells got a late-night phone call saying Rose Lane 's beloved grandmother , " Miss Julia " White , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twiggs County to Rose Lane . <p> The farm was a diversified operation with a herd of cattle and acres of cotton and corn and hay . The Leavells decided to move temporarily to the rambling 1870s farmhouse to protect the property until they could decide what to do with it . <p> Right away , they were hit with the stark reality of land inheritance . Estate taxes forced them to sell some of the farm to make the first payment to the Internal Revenue Service . It took 15 years for them to pay off the entire debt . <p> Meanwhile , Leavell and Rose Lane had to decide how to make the farm productive . <p> " It was obvious that I could not do the farming or cattle raising thing , " Leavell says . " I knew nothing about those things , and since I was so much on the road , I knew that I could not devote the necessary time to it . " <p> His brother-in-law , Alton White III , made the pivotal suggestion . <p> " He said , ' There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have cattle , so you might consider planting it in trees , ' " Leavell recalls . " A light bulb went off in my head , and I said , ' Wow , yeah , that 's something I could do . I could raise trees and still go on tours and tend to my music . ' " <p> In the long term , Leavell surmised , growing trees would be good for both the land and the world in general . <p> While on the road with the Fabulous Thunderbirds in the mid-1980s , Leavell took a correspondence course in forestry . He did his homework on the tour bus . <p> Since that time , tree growing has been Leavell 's other passion in life . <p> The Leavells purchased additional acreage and enlarged the farm to 2,200 acres . They renamed it " Charlane "  --  the " Char " stands for Leavell 's formal first name , Charles , and the " Lane " for Rose Lane . <p> Driving down the gravel road leading to Charlane , visitors pass rows of pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The road goes to the old farmhouse , which has been enlarged by the Leavells . Inside , family pictures , some from the early 1900s , fill the walls alongside gold albums , forestry awards and Rose Lane 's paintings . <p> One wall sags with Leavell 's huge collection of vinyl records , CDs and cassette tapes . <p> Two Jack Russell terriers and a cat named Booker make the home complete . <p> The plantation , which costs about $150,000 a year to maintain , has a full-time manager and handyman and several part-time workers . <p> The property also includes a quail-hunting preserve . Charlane can put up 12 people in three separate buildings . A full day of quail hunting , including hunting licenses , guns , dogs ( English setters and pointers ) and home-cooked Southern meals , costs up to $600 a head . <p> Leavell often joins the hunters . " There 's something very special for me about the relationship of the dogs , the birds , the woods , " he says . <p> If he can help it , Leavell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He built a stable for his Tennessee walking horses out of trees damaged by a storm , and he and Rose Lane furnished the interior of their kitchen with wood left over from an old servant 's house . <p> Leavell is a firm believer in education  --  despite being a high school dropout himself . He and Rose Lane have built a 1.5-mile nature trail on Charlane replete with interpretative exhibits about the plants and habitats along the way . At the beginning of the trail , an outdoor classroom is used to instruct the dozen or so school groups that visit the plantation each year . <p> On a typical day this time of year , when Leavell is not on the road or recording , he might crank up his John Deere tractor to harrow some feed plots for wildlife , check on some longleaf pine plantings done earlier this year , check the nature trail for fallen limbs and debris , listen for quail calls to try to determine the nesting possibilities , check on the horses to make sure they have enough water and feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But he does not intend to give up touring or recording . A couple of hundred yards from his farmhouse is his spacious soundproof studio , with several keyboards , sophisticated recording equipment and his pride and delight , a Yamaha grand piano . <p> Leavell often takes his guests to the studio for an impromptu performance . For five recent guests , he played " Jessica " on the piano as passionately as if he were playing for 50,000 concertgoers . <p> The trees , however , are never far from his mind . <p> When he 's on tour , he says , he often finds his mind wandering back to Charlane . " I 'll be thinking , ' Geez , I wonder if I got any rain back home , ' or I wonder how the dogs are doing , if the dog had a litter of pups , " he said . " You ca n't wait to get back home and ride the horses or get into the truck and drive . " Chuck Leavell hugs a tree in a 14-year-old stand of loblolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macon .
