AUGUST 5 , 2005 . KAUAI , HAWAII // Who 's Going to Laugh at Mick Jagger ? // I 'm on Kauai , in Hawaii , today , Friday , August 5 , 2005 . It 's unbelievably clear and sunny , not a cloud in the sky . As if the concept clouds does n't even exist . I came here at the end of July and , as always , we rented a condo . During the mornings , when it 's cool , I sit at my desk , writing all sorts of things . Like now : I 'm writing this , a piece on running that I can pretty much compose as I wish . It 's summer , so naturally it 's hot . Hawaii 's been called the island of eternal summer , but since it 's in the Northern Hemisphere there are , arguably , four seasons of a sort . Summer is somewhat hotter than winter . I spend a lot of time in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and compared to Cambridge  --  so muggy and hot with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of torture  --  summer in Hawaii is a veritable paradise . No need for an air conditioner here  --  just leave the window open , and a refreshing breeze blows in . People in Cambridge are always surprised when they hear I 'm spending August in Hawaii . " Why would you want to spend summer in a hot place like that ? " they invariably ask . But they do n't know what it 's like . How the constant trade winds from the northeast make summers cool . How happy life is here , where we can enjoy lounging around , reading a book in the shade of trees , or , if the notion strikes us , go down , just as we are , for a dip in the inlet . // Since I arrived in Hawaii I 've run about an hour every day , six days a week . It 's two and a half months now since I resumed my old lifestyle in which , unless it 's totally unavoidable , I run every single day . Today I ran for an hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Lovin ' Spoonful  --  Daydream and Hums of the Lovin ' Spoonful  --  which I 'd recorded on an MD disc . // Right now I 'm aiming at increasing the distance I run , so speed is less of an issue . As long as I can run a certain distance , that 's all I care about . Sometimes I run fast when I feel like it , but if I increase the pace I shorten the amount of time I run , the point being to let the exhilaration I feel at the end of each run carry over to the next day . This is the same sort of tack I find necessary when writing a novel . I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write more . Do that , and the next day 's work goes surprisingly smoothly . I think Ernest Hemingway did something like that . To keep on going , you have to keep up the rhythm . This is the important thing for long-term projects . Once you set the pace , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spin at a set speed  --  and to get to that point takes as much concentration and effort as you can manage . // It rained for a short time while I was running , but it was a cooling rain that felt good . A thick cloud blew in from the ocean right over me , and a gentle rain fell for a while , but then , as if it had remembered , " Oh , I 've got to do some errands ! , " it whisked itself away without so much as a glance back . And then the merciless sun was back , scorching the ground . It 's a very easy-to-understand weather pattern . Nothing abstruse or ambivalent about it , not a speck of the metaphor or the symbolic . On the way I passed a few other joggers , about an equal number of men and women . The energetic ones were zipping down the road , slicing through the air like they had robbers at their heels . Others , overweight , huffed and puffed , their eyes half closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world they wanted to be doing . They looked like maybe a week ago their doctors had told them they have diabetes and warned them they had to start exercising . I 'm somewhere in the middle . // I love listening to the Lovin ' Spoonful . Their music is sort of laid-back and never pretentious . Listening to this soothing music brings back a lot of memories of the 1960s . Nothing really special , though . If they were to make a movie about my life ( just the thought of which scares me ) , these would be the scenes they 'd leave on the cutting-room floor . " We can leave this episode out , " the editor would explain . " It 's not bad , but it 's sort of ordinary and does n't amount to much . " Those kinds of memories  --  unpretentious , commonplace . But for me , they 're all meaningful and valuable . As each of these memories flits across my mind , I 'm sure I unconsciously smile , or give a slight frown . Commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has led to one result : me . Me here and now , on the north shore of Kauai . Sometimes when I think of life , I feel like a piece of driftwood washed up on shore . // As I run , the trade winds blowing in from the direction of the lighthouse rustle the leaves of the eucalyptus over my head . // I began living in Cambridge , Massachusetts , at the end of May of this year , and running has once again been the mainstay of my daily routine ever since . I 'm seriously running now . By seriously I mean thirty-six miles a week . In other words , six miles a day , six days a week . It would be better if I ran seven days , but I have to factor in rainy days , and days when work keeps me too busy . There are some days , too , when frankly I just feel too tired to run . Taking all this into account , I leave one day a week as a day off . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every month , which for me is my standard for serious running . // In June I followed this plan exactly , running 156 miles on the nose . In July I increased the distance and covered 186 miles . I averaged six miles every day , without taking a single day off . I do n't mean I covered precisely six miles every day . If I ran nine miles one day , the next day I 'd do only three . ( At a jogging pace I generally can cover six miles in an hour . ) For me this is most definitely running at a serious level . And since I came to Hawaii I 've kept up this pace . It had been far too long since I 'd been able to run these distances and keep up this kind of fixed schedule . // There are several reasons why , at a certain point in my life , I stopped running seriously . First of all , my life has been getting busier , and free time is increasingly at a premium . When I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free time as I wanted , but at least I did n't have as many miscellaneous chores as I do now . I do n't know why , but the older you get , the busier you become . Another reason is that I 've gotten more interested in triathlons , rather than marathons . Triathlons , of course , involve swimming and cycling in addition to running . The running part is n't a problem for me , but in order to master the other two legs of the event I had to devote a great deal of time to training in swimming and biking . I had to start over from scratch with swimming , relearning the correct form , learning the right biking techniques , and training the necessary muscles . All of this took time and effort , and as a result I had less time to devote to running . // Probably the main reason , though , was that at a certain point I 'd simply grown tired of it . I started running in the fall of 1982 and have been running since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jogged almost every day , run in at least one marathon every year  --  twenty-three up till now  --  and participated in more long-distance races all around the world than I care to count . Long-distance running suits my personality , though , and of all the habits I 've acquired over my lifetime I 'd have to say this one has been the most helpful , the most meaningful . Running without a break for more than two decades has also made me stronger , both physically and emotionally . // The thing is , I 'm not much for team sports . That 's just the way I am . Whenever I play soccer or baseball  --  actually , since becoming an adult this is almost never  --  I never feel comfortable . Maybe it 's because I do n't have any brothers , but I could never get into the kind of games you play with others . I 'm also not very good at-one-on-one sports like tennis . I enjoy squash , but generally when it comes to a game against someone , the competitive aspect makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , you can count me out . // Do n't misunderstand me  --  I 'm not totally uncompetitive . It 's just that for some reason I never cared all that much whether I beat others or lost to them . This sentiment remained pretty much unchanged after I grew up . It does n't matter what field you 're talking about  --  beating somebody else just does n't do it for me . I 'm much more interested in whether I reach the goals that I set for myself , so in this sense long-distance running is the perfect fit for a mindset like mine . // Marathon runners will understand what I mean . We do n't really care whether we beat any other particular runner . World-class runners , of course , want to outdo their closest rivals , but for your average , everyday runner , individual rivalry is n't a major issue . I 'm sure there are garden-variety runners whose desire to beat a particular rival spurs them on to train harder . But what happens if their rival , for whatever reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running would disappear or at least diminish , and it 'd be hard for them to remain runners for long . // Most ordinary runners are motivated by an individual goal , more than anything : namely , a time they want to beat . As long as he can beat that time , a runner will feel he 's accomplished what he set out to do , and if he ca n't , then he 'll feel he has n't . Even if he does n't break the time he 'd hoped for , as long as he has the sense of satisfaction at having done his very best  --  and , possibly , having made some significant discovery about himself in the process  --  then that in itself is an accomplishment , a positive feeling he can carry over to the next race . // The same can be said about my profession . In the novelist 's profession , as far as I 'm concerned , there 's no such thing as winning or losing . Maybe numbers of copies sold , awards won , and critics ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but none of them really matter . What 's crucial is whether your writing attains the standards you 've set for yourself . Failure to reach that bar is not something you can easily explain away . When it comes to other people , you can always come up with a reasonable explanation , but you ca n't fool yourself . In this sense , writing novels and running full marathons are very much alike . Basically a writer has a quiet , inner motivation , and does n't seek validation in the outwardly visible . // For me , running is both exercise and a metaphor . Running day after day , piling up the races , bit by bit I raise the bar , and by clearing each level I elevate myself . At least that 's why I 've put in the effort day after day : to raise my own level . I 'm no great runner , by any means . I 'm at an ordinary  --  or perhaps more like mediocre  --  level . But that 's not the point . The point is whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only opponent you have to beat is yourself , the way you used to be . // Since my forties , though , this system of self-assessment has gradually changed . Simply put , I am no longer able to improve my time . I guess it 's inevitable , considering my age . At a certain age everybody reaches their physical peak . There are individual differences , but for the most part swimmers hit that watershed in their early twenties , boxers in their late twenties , and baseball players in their mid-thirties . It 's something everyone has to go through . Once I asked an ophthalmologist if anyone 's ever avoided getting farsighted when they got older . He laughed and said , " I 've never met one yet . " It 's the same thing . ( Fortunately , the peak for artists varies considerably . Dostoyevsky , for instance , wrote two of his most profound novels , The Possessed and The Brothers Karamazov , in the last few years of his life before his death at age sixty . Domenico Scarlatti wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was between the ages of fifty-seven and sixty-two. ) // My peak as a runner came in my late forties . Before then I 'd aimed at running a full marathon in three and a half hours , a pace of exactly one kilometer in five minutes , or one mile in eight . Sometimes I broke three and a half hours , sometimes not ( more often not ) . Either way , I was able to steadily run a marathon in more or less that amount of time . Even when I thought I 'd totally blown it , I 'd still be in under three hours and forty minutes . Even if I had n't trained so much or was n't in the best of shape , exceeding four hours was inconceivable . Things continued at that stable plateau for a while , but before long they started to change . I 'd train as much as before but found it increasingly hard to break three hours and forty minutes . It was taking me five and a half minutes to run one kilometer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marathon . Frankly , this was a bit of a shock . What was going on here ? I did n't think it was because I was aging . In everyday life I never felt like I was getting physically weaker . But no matter how much I might deny it or try to ignore it , the numbers were retreating , step by step . // Besides , as I said earlier , I 'd become more interested in other sports such as triathlons and squash . Just running all the time could n't be good for me , I 'd figured , deciding it would be better to add variety to my routine and develop a more all-around physical regimen . I hired a private swimming coach who started me off with the basics , and I learned how to swim faster and more smoothly than before . My muscles reacted to the new environment , and my physique began noticeably changing . Meanwhile , like the tide going out , my marathon times slowly but surely continued to slow . And I found I did n't enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue opened up between me and the very notion of running . //
