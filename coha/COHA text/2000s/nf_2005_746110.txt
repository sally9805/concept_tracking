Section : ARTS THEATER The playwright drew a line between reaching out and selling out <p> Broadway theaters dimmed their marquees at curtain time the evening after Arthur Miller died . I like to think that somewhere in Times Square at that moment Miller 's raspy chuckle could be heard floating sardonically through Manhattan 's sooty air . He would have been amused by this traditional tribute from the American commercial theater , which for 60 years viewed him with an ambivalence he fully reciprocated . Only All My Sons and Death of a Salesman were unequivocal hits in their initial Broadway productions , way back in the late 1940s . During the last three decades of his life , exactly two of his plays premiered on the Great White Way , 14 years apart , and both flopped . <p> Miller , who died February 10 at the age of 89 , professed never to have expected anything other than " the celebratory embraces soon followed by rejection or contempt " that he defined in his autobiography Timebends as the lot of every serious American playwright operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content to see his later plays produced in the saner environs of England 's subsidized national theaters or America 's regional , non-profit companies . " I was not raised to be surprised when a marriage between commerce and art collapsed , " he explained , referring obliquely to his parents ' troubled union as well as to his native country 's perennial suspicion of high-falutin writers who aimed to do more than entertain . <p> Yet the breakup of art 's marriage to commerce was still bothering him in 1987 , when Timebends was published . His description of the Broadway that welcomed Death of a Salesman was notably conflicted . " I thought the theater a temple being rotted out with commercialized junk , where mostly by accident an occasional good piece of work appeared , " he wrote . But , he continued , " it was also a time when the audience was basically the same for musicals and light entertainment as for the ambitious stuff . ... Serious writers could reasonably assume they were addressing the whole American mix , and so their plays , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would not require specialists or a coterie to be understood . " <p> Miller never stopped regretting the loss of that relatively diverse audience and the resulting diminishment of American theater 's reach . " When my plays were first produced , there was a still-extant tradition that the theater was a public matter , " he once told me . " The theater was the ultimate tribunal in which we were to test all our beliefs . " His most open testament to that tradition was n't exactly warmly welcomed on Broadway in 1953 , when nervous reviewers criticized The Crucible as a tiresome message drama without daring to explain what the message was : that communist-hunting and witch-hunting were equally insane . But it was on Broadway for six months , and it even won a Tony Award . Spectators ran the gamut from politically conservative theatergoers who , according to Miller , froze when they realized what the play was driving at , to the audience on June 19 that stood in silence as John Proctor was taken away to be hanged , knowing that Julius and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <p> It 's difficult to imagine an American playwright today having that kind of broad cultural impact . Miller himself , though he wrote fine dramas into the 1990s , never again quite so successfully probed our social , personal , and political anxieties as he had during his first few years as a professional playwright . ( He touched a nerve one more time in 1964 with After the Fall , which portrayed his marriage to Marilyn Monroe with an admittedly one-sided honesty that was brutally at odds with the media 's sanctimonious breast-beating when she died in 1962 . ) His often crotchety pronouncements as an elder statesman averred that the commercial theater simply had no room anymore for " big , world-challenging plays . " Theater critics and a good many higher-browed intellectuals , however , suggested that time had simply passed Miller by . They might honor his political activism , including defiance of the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1956 and defense of persecuted writers worldwide during his 1965-1969 tenure as president of International PEN , but Miller 's artistic populism led them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moralist adhering to an outmoded tradition of social protest , stubbornly resisting both the stylistic innovations and the radical existential angst of Beckett &; Co . That was definitely the undercurrent in many of the respectful but faintly lugubrious obituaries . <p> Reservations about Miller , whether expressed by a critic patronizing his lack of avant-garde aspirations or a Broadway producer unwilling to finance anything but yet another revival of Salesman , seem to me to reflect a deeper unease with his notion of what theater is . For more than hall a century , everything he wrote and said glowed with the belief that theater is a public art with a mission to bring people together in a public place to speak to them about matters of common concern . That is an old-fashioned idea , and not just because commercial theater is now so ridiculously expensive that its increasingly gray-haired and well-heeled patrons are wary of anything except guaranteed entertainment . It 's more fundamental than that . We live in an age when public libraries and public schools , for example , are too often regarded as institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , and when many people ca n't walk down a street or through a park without isolating themselves in a private space via their cell phone conversations . Theater is a beleaguered outpost of collective life , an activity that can not take place in your living room , online , or over a headset . That is why Miller 's old-fashioned idea is eternally relevant and spiritually indispensable . <p> As I was reading the obituaries , wondering why they annoyed me so much and trying to figure out why Arthur Miller mattered so much to me , ah odd assortment of memories bounced off each other . Surprisingly , they were n't of his work , but of younger artists and more recent shows . I thought of the riveting performance of Tony Kushner 's musical play Caroline , which I saw in the final week of its too-short run at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre , where the actors soared on a current of energy flowing between them and the audience . I thought of last year 's blistering revival of the 1991 musical Assassins , playing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , prompting rumors that the producers had been pressured to shutter Stephen Sondheim 's sardonic ode to presidential killers before the Republican National Convention hit town . I thought of Caryl Churchill 's meditation on cloning , A Number , staged this winter at the New York Theatre Workshop with stadium-style seating encircling the couch that served as the battleground for actors Dallas Roberts and Sam Shepard . The setting recalled both an ancient Greek amphitheater and a 19th-century surgical theater , inviting spectators to observe each other as well as the players while the cast explored Churchill 's thoughts on the complexities of human identity , guilt , and responsibility . <p> None of these three 2004 productions had much stylistic connection to the plays that made Miller famous . All took advantage of the liberation from literal realism that blew into the theater in Waiting for Godot 's absurdist wake : the washing machine sang in Caroline ; a carnival barker brought on the attackers in Assassins ; oblique conversations , roiled by menacing emotional undercurrents , in A Number recalled the work of Harold Pinter ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blunt and direct even when wildly imaginative , has a clear temperamental affinity with Miller ; Sondheim 's cynicism and Churchill 's ease with indirect dialogue and narrative are both equally outside Miller 's range . What all three share with Miller , the quality that made their recent plays spring to mind after his death , is a wholehearted faith in the essential nature of theater . Each of the productions breathed with charged interactions between the performers and the audience and among the audience members . Swept up though I was in the performances , I was always aware of the people watching them with me : the scattered walkouts at Assassins , still shocking 13 years after it was created ; Caroline 's enthusiastic , sometimes vocal crowd , considerably younger and blacker than the Broadway norm ; the intent faces , clearly visible in the spill of light from the playing area they flanked so closely , of the hushed spectators at A Number . <p> We were experiencing these works together , creating with the performers an event that would never be repeated . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices . ( No good dramatist  --  and that includes Assassins ' book writer , John Weidman  --  makes every character onstage parrot an authorial point of view . ) What a welcome change from the torrent of raw information that bombards us beyond the stage door , some of it from sources we ca n't even identify , which leaves us with the daunting task of ordering these fragments into some kind of meaningful understanding . Theater offers us unity . It 's no accident , though it certainly reflects my personal preferences , that these three plays , like Miller 's , couple strong social and political content with explorations of individual longings , fears , and neuroses . Theater at its most exciting and engaging embraces the wholeness of life ; it sees how alone we are , yet how entangled we are with others . Today , we frantically connect via the Internet or our cell phones , but it seems harder and harder just to occupy a particular physical space and to live " in the moment "  --  a state of being , significantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go to the theater , no matter how harrowing ( or trivial ) the show is , I am always happy simply to be in a room with a substantial number of people participating in the same adventure . In our digital , virtual age , I think we crave that human contact more than ever . <p> What does this have to do with Arthur Miller 's fraught relationship with Broadway ? Bear with me a little longer . Another theatrical experience that came to mind when considering Miller 's legacy took place in November , when I watched Eve Ensler , long a mainstay of the downtown scene . She zestfully took advantage of the Booth Theatre 's resources to trot out a bunch of fancy audiovisual toys to amuse her midtown audience at The Good Body , a one-woman show that scathingly and hilariously connected her obsession with her stomach to the larger subject of a global culture that encourages women to be at once narcissistic and self-hating . " It 's amazing to have brought me to Broadway ! " she exclaimed afterward with unabashed egocentricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could move things that concern women to a bigger venue and make them more substantial in the culture . " <p> Although I said it 's difficult to imagine an American playwright today having the impact that Miller once did , I could easily make the contrary point with Ensler 's previous play , The Vagina Monologues . It shattered taboos , was translated into dozens of languages , and ran in theaters around the world . The author used her newfound status to launch V-Day , an annual event that has raised millions of dollars for organizations working to stop violence against women . And her brand of populism inspires just as much unease as Miller 's , though for different reasons : the same sorts of cultural authorities who disdained him as on old fuddy-duddy knock Ensler as a creature of the modern publicity system , regrettably willing to work the media and to enlist pop celebrities to promote her causes . Is The Vagina Monologues a masterpiece ? No , but Caroline is , and Tony Kushner was so determined to move it uptown from its limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential investors and producers , putting himself into the commercial fray in a way that would have had Eugene O'Neill reaching for the whisky bottle . Strange as it seems , Broadway still matters  --  or , more accurately , the audience it can deliver does . <p> Why ? Because the confinement of theater to a coterie , be it subscribers or tourists , is a condition that goads every truly ambitious artist . Sondheim , a generation older than Ensler and Kushner , has made it clear in interviews how painful he finds the loss of the Broadway audience that in the 1950s embraced sophisticated musicals like Gypsy ( for which he wrote the lyrics ) and was willing through the ' 70s to take a look at the more challenging , confrontational shows he created with Hal Prince , from Company to Sweeney Todd . He may have had to accept smaller theaters and limited runs , but no one can make him like them . <p> Younger playwrights and composers have learned to live with the new order , and so have theatergoers looking for something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are developed in workshops and performed to tiny audiences of the artists ' friends and potential backers . Then they move on to the regional theaters or to New York 's nonprofits , which are limited by union contracts to auditoriums seating no more than 499 people  --  and often many fewer . I subscribe to some of these theaters , and I 'm grateful that they exist . But it 's a fairly homogeneous group of intellectuals and bohemians that fills these small spaces , while The Lion King grabs the out-of-towners and the families . The cozy interchange among a few hundred folks will never match the electricity generated when a thousand or more people metamorphose into an enthralled Broadway audience . Lion King director Julie Taymor and Pulitzer Prize-winner Suzan-Lori Parks ( who 's writing a musical for Disney ) are among the avant-garde artists who 've decided they might be able to work in the commercial theater without merely dispensing pabulum to the masses . Venerable nonprofit organizations like the Roundabout and Manhattan Theatre Club have moved to Times Square , while plays that make a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season ) transfer to Broadway houses . The process has changed , but the goals are still the same : to keep theater in the mainstream American cultural landscape , to attract as many people as possible to a medium like no other . <p> Theater , by its nature , assumes that we can communicate with each other directly and in person . That kind of communication is frighteningly endangered in contemporary life , and any art form that sustains it is too important to be abandoned to the happy few . I doubt that Arthur Miller , born in 1915 , thought in those terms , but he felt theater 's necessity in the context of the time that shaped him . No one was ever more contemptuous of Broadway 's crassness than Miller , but he worked there as much as he could because he believed that the popular theater  --  and in this country that 's always been the commercial theater  --  was the arena in which he could convey his ideas to the widest cross section of his fellow citizens . That belief continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimmed marquees on Broadway might have been a fitting tribute to Miller after all . They reminded us of a commercial theater that was once genuinely inclusive , presenting fluff and food for thought to a broad audience . Broadway today is not so immediately welcoming to serious playwrights as it was to the young Arthur Miller , but new generations have found new means to bring us together in new places  --  and to move on to Broadway when they can . In many ways , the American theater is more democratic and broader based than it ever was , even if for every regional nonprofit nurturing new work there 's a 3,000-seat barn of a venue presenting a touring , brand-name musical so over-amplified and dependent on special effects that you might as well be watching a movie . The theater 's special qualities are still being defended and extended by artists who struggle to draw the line between reaching out and selling out . Miller 's vision of theater 's vital place in our public life endures . As it must , if theater is to endure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1961 <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Theater , by its nature , assumes that we can communicate with each other directly and in person . <p> By Wendy Smith <p> <p> Wendy Smith is the author of Real Life Drama : The Group Theatre and America , 1931-1940 .
