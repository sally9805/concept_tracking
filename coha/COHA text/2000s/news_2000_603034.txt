<p> NEW YORK  --  Life in media and technology returned to normal on Tuesday . But after a day of history and hype following America Online 's agreement to acquire Time Warner in a deal now worth $ 145 billion , it was n't so clear what that word  --  " normal "  --  means anymore . <p> Everyone agrees that the competitive landscape will change , probably dramatically , as the largest Internet provider and media company search for new ways to combine and transmit news and entertainment . <p> Time Warner 's movie , TV , music and publishing properties range all the way from CNN to Kid Rock . <p> The new thinking was in evidence at a post-deal meeting of Time Warner managers in Atlanta . <p> " We were all given marching orders that every Time Warner business unit should be thinking about working together " with AOL , says Turner Sports President Mark Lazarus . " We should make every effort , investigate every opportunity . " <p> But outside the companies , the morning after was also a time for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much can be realized in the near term . <p> That 's not easy . It has become hard for even unsentimental pragmatists to figure out what potential deals and high-tech consumer services are realistic , and which are just ridiculous . <p> " There 's an enormous amount of sloppy thinking going on here , " says PaineWebber 's Christopher Dixon . <p> Investors also grew increasingly wary of Monday 's hype . Time Warner shares closed Tuesday at $ 85 , down 5 . And AOL shares slid 6 3/4 to $ 64 1/2 . That lowered the value of the deal to $ 145 billion from $ 160 billion , based on Monday 's stock prices . <p> One assumption subject to new skepticism is that AOL 's combination with Time Warner will inspire a torrent of deals . <p> " These are big damn companies , " Dixon says . " There are not a lot of others that can pull this off . " <p> Still , analysts expect AOL and Time Warner 's rivals to search for ways to match the merged company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and scale . <p> " This is clearly going to force everyone in both the online and offline worlds to go back to the drawing board and reassess their strategic positioning , " says George Boutros , head of high-tech mergers for Credit Suisse First Boston . <p> " There had been a lot of talk about doing these kind of deals , but now that AOL and Time Warner have actually acted , there is certainly a new sense of urgency . " <p> Internet powers that have the stock or cash to make a big acquisition  --  and compelling needs to keep up with AOL  --  include Yahoo , Lycos , Excite At Home and Alta Vista . <p> Microsoft also could join that list , although a major deal would probably exacerbate its unresolved antitrust problems in Washington . <p> Nothing 's too far-fetched <p> But only a few traditional media companies  --  or hybrids of new and old  --  are in Time Warner 's league when it comes to news and entertainment . Sony , General Electric 's NBC , and USA Networks are known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of potential buyers or sellers in this realm would have to include Disney , News Corp. , Viacom and Seagram . It would be a shock , though , if the strong-willed moguls who run those companies agreed to share their power with an Internet company . That 's why some analysts envision a range of deals and joint ventures that blend assets of studios , cable companies and Internet companies . <p> In addition , e-commerce companies may feel emboldened to go after traditional retailers . <p> " This is the bricks-and-clicks era , " says Gary Arlen , a multimedia consultant with Arlen Communications . " Nowadays , nothing is too far-fetched . " <p> For example , online software distributor Beyond.com might want to hook up with a bricks-and-mortar computer seller , such as CompUSA , or even an office-supply company , such as Staples . Another possibility : Online grocers such as Webvan and Peapod might try to forge alliances with supermarket chains such as Kroger or Safeway . <p> " There 's no question that online and offline assets are more valuable together than they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SG Cowen . " Consumers do n't just live in an online world , and companies need to get them wherever they are . " <p> However , Reamer says , people should n't expect a slew of mergers right away . Companies are likely to wait to see how Wall Street treats the AOL Time Warner deal . <p> " You can argue the merits of this deal until you 're blue in the face , " he says , " but the ultimate arbiter is the stock price . " <p> Meanwhile , technology specialists pooh-poohed speculation that AOL and Time Warner might create synergies by making Time Warner 's library of movies and TV shows available to customers of high-speed Internet services . <p> " The transfer of all those assets to a digital format would require billions of dollars and take many , many quarters , " says The Envisioneering Group 's Richard Doherty . <p> What 's more , most studios fear that anything they put on the Internet will become instant fodder for pirates . Encryption standards are n't yet secure enough . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video transmissions  --  particularly for movie-length productions . <p> That could change soon , though . New compression schemes will enable most high-speed services to deliver VCR-quality video , which might be sufficient for those who want to watch music videos on demand . <p> Traditional entertainment video over the Internet " is not for tomorrow , " says Jonathan Taplin , CEO of video-on-demand company Intertainer . But in a few years  --  after studios are sure there 's no security problem  --  " absolutely , totally . I see unlimited horizons here . " <p> Big marketing potential <p> Still , AOL Time Warner could generate additional revenue right away by providing a one-stop shopping service for marketers who want their messages to reach consumers in new and traditional media alike . <p> " Now you can go to General Motors and say , here 's a package across all these media that will reach 90% of your target audience , " says Peter Kreisky , head of the media practice at Mercer Management . <p> " Integrated marketing is what clients are looking for , " says Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They want to own a demographic market , so they have cable TV , a magazine and restaurants . It 's hard for any advertiser who 's trying to reach that demographic to ignore them . " <p> AOL Time Warner would be especially appealing to advertisers who want to reach teenage girls . <p> The WB network , which features shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Felicity , appeals to that market . Time Warner magazines , such as Teen People , also cater to that group . And now , through AOL , marketers who have advertised to those girls on TV and in print can get them while they 're online . <p> " This deal is n't a way for Time Warner to sell ads on the Internet , " says Jim Nail , senior analyst at Forrester Research . <p> " What the Internet can do better than other media is provide a direct connection with customers and prospects . " Ultimately , AOL and Time Warner might most influence the course of the Internet  --  and their company  --  by duplicating a strategy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new channels , led by HBO , CNN and MTV , created and packaged programming that consumers wanted enough to justify paying monthly fees . <p> This time , executives at AOL and Time Warner want to attract new customers with services such as You 've Got Photos and My Jukebox . <p> " Everybody has come to accept that the Internet is here and now , " Dixon says . <p> " But we 're still in the early innings . I do n't believe there are 30 million people who use the Internet on a daily basis . Until you have that , you do n't know what it is . " <p> Indeed , Internet retailers sold fewer CDs , total , last year than retail outlets did of just one title  --  the Backstreet Boys ' Millennium . <p> And , despite the hype , the executives at AOL Time Warner clearly think they know how to seed a new medium . Time Warner 's Gerald Levin helped to start HBO . Ted Turner created CNN . And AOL President Bob Pittman was a force at MTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thor Valdmanis
