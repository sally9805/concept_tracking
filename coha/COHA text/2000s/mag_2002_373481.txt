Investors have been net sellers of stock mutual funds most of the summer . Yet in this abysmal market their love affair with exchange-traded funds , or ETFs , has truly bloomed . In June and July combined , stock funds saw estimated outflows of $60 billion , while ETFs had inflows of $11 billion . What gives them such allure ? All the things that suddenly matter when markets turn rocky : diversification , tax efficiency , low costs and portfolio visibility that would make most fund managers blush . <P> ETFs are stock funds that trade on an exchange like common shares of IBM or Coca-Cola . The first ones were launched in 1993 . Amid heavy marketing by key players , including Barclays Global Investors and Merrill Lynch , asset growth has taken off in recent years , swelling nearly ninefold since 1998 to $88 billion in the U.S. etf inflows this year have already doubled the total from all of last year . ETFs have proved so popular that Barclays extended its line in July to include bonds , the first ETFs of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global portfolio using nothing but ETFs . <P> Here 's how they work : an etf share represents a basket of stocks or bonds typically pegged to a major index such as the S &P; 500 or Morgan Stanley Capital International 's benchmark foreign index , eafe ( Europe , Asia , Far East ) . There are now 102 such ETFs in the U.S. , including some that target specific industries and countries . They can be bought and sold through any broker and can be traded through the day . <P> ETFs have distinct advantages over open-end stock funds . They tend to be widely diversified , and investors can get a daily view of what 's in the fund . The annual management fee is low , and ETFs are tax efficient because the stocks within them seldom change and their unusual structure ensures that holders rarely if ever get socked with a capital-gains distribution . You can even sell an etf short ( bet on the price to fall ) . There are disadvantages , like trading commissions that can quickly erode the benefits of ETFs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sock money away on a monthly basis . ETFs are ideal for those who have a lump sum and want to spread it around the globe , as well as for those who want to speculate on near-term market moves or hedge other holdings in times of uncertainty . Institutions have embraced them , driving down the cost structure ; they may be suitable for you too . <P> Say you have a long-held bond with a big gain . You suspect that rates are going to move up for a while and push bond prices down . Rather than sell your bond and pay tax , you can sell short the iShares Lehman 7-10 Year Treasury ( ticker : IEF ) to hedge against a rate decline without triggering a tax bill .
