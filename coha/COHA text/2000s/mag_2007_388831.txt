Headnote Refrigerator manufacturers are hot for your dollar as they load up their latest models with more style and conveniences in an effort to surpass the more than 11 million units they sold two years ago . Most major brands are now offering French-door models with side-by-side doors above and a freezer below . You 'll even find a French-door setup on builtins from KitchenAid and Thermador . Big brands are also piling on the options as bottom-freezers wind up in more and more kitchens . We tested a Sub-Zero built-in equipped with two bottom-freezer drawers , an arrangement designed for better organization . Price : a cool $7,600 . After months of rigorously testing more than 70 models from 20 brands , here 's what else we learned : Trickle-down takes effect . Features once found only on midlevel and high-end fridges are showing up on less-expensive models.Water filters remove " off " tastes , while temperature-control bins keep food fresh . Spillproof shelves make cleanup a snap , while stainless exteriors are available on tested models as low as $725 . High style drops in price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monogram built-in but the prices give you nightmares , take heart . Both brands offer freestanding models that did well in our tests . While their $3,050 to $3,700 prices still are n't cheap , they 're up to $3,400 less than some of these brands ' built-in models . Water filters vary . All four filters we tested did an excellent job of removing bad tastes , but only the Whirlpool Pur 4396841 and Kenmore Pur Ultimate II 09030 did well overall . The GE Profile SmartWater MWF was judged good ; the Frigidaire PureSource2 SWF2CB , only fair . The Kenmore was very good at removing lead and chloroform , while the Frigidaire was a poor performer in these areas . ( See " Water filters , " on page 38 . ) Innovation continues . Jenn-Air is rolling out an oiled-bronze finish , a style alternative to the omnipresent stainless steel . And LG will unveil a $3,600 sideby- side refrigerator with a built-in 15-inch high-definition TV . HOW TO CHOOSE Start by picking a style that meets your family 's needs.You 'll find the pros and cons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 34 . But since function still trumps form , consider these factors as you research your next purchase on the Web or in stores : Size it up.Whether you 're remodeling your kitchen or simply replacing your refrigerator , carefully measure the space available . Be especially accurate with the width-it 's the most critical dimension because that space tends to be limited by counters , cabinets , and other fixed objects . Also measure the doorways and the route the refrigerator will travel when it 's delivered.When shopping , find out how much space is required for factors like ventilation and door clearance . A small mistake in measuring could be costly in time and money . Check the claims . Manufacturers ' claimed capacity does n't accurately represent how much you 'll be able to stow . It does n't factor in the space eaten up by hardware , dispensers , and inaccessible areas.We measure capacity you can use . Aim for efficiency . Refrigerators consume more electricity than any other kitchen appliance .

Select a reliable brand . You 'll find plenty of capable , low-priced refrigerators in our Ratings . But even a bargain-priced performer could leave you cold if it does n't hold up over time.Our repair history , right , compiled by the Consumer Reports National Research Center and based on 95,000 responses to our surveys , can save you some headaches by helping you choose a reliable brand . With this information in hand , you 'll find a refrigerator that 's not only reliable at keeping food cold but also offers convenience features and styling that make the plain white box an appliance dinosaur . First things first . Choose a type that fits your space , needs , and budget . TOP-FREEZER Best for narrower spaces . These models cost the least of any type , are relatively inexpensive to run , and offer the most storage space for their size . Typical width : 30 to 33 inches . But you must bend to reach for items that you use frequently . Few models offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $1,200 . BOTTOM-FREEZER Best for keeping items at eye level . Many provide abundant storage . French-door models ( below ) are becoming more common . Typical width : 30 to 36 inches . But you must stoop for items at the back or bottom of the freezer . Few have an in-door iceand- water dispenser . Price $700 to $1,500 ; $1,600 to $1,800 for French-door . SIDE-BY-SIDE Best for a kitchen that ca n't fit wide-swinging doors . Most sideby- sides offer exterior ice and water dispensers . Typical width : 32 to 36 inches . But they 're relatively pricey and are n't very space efficient . This type has been more repairprone than topand bottomfreezers . Most shelves are too narrow for large pizza boxes . Price $800 to $2,000 . BUILT-IN Best for a unified look that 's flush with cabinetry . These are either bottom-freezers or sideby- sides ; some brands make a French-door built-in . Typical width : 36 inches or wider . But they are pricey and repairprone , and often require trim panels . Price $4,000 to $7,000 for built-ins ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . closeup THE BIG CHILL At about 5 feet wide , the Kenmore Pro Professional Size Refrigerator/ Freezer two-appliance pair makes a bold statement . Adopting the look of restaurant gear , the fridge and freezer have a stainless finish and exterior temperature gauges . But open the doors , and soft lighting gradually intensifies , highlighting features like a crisper and a meat/cheese drawer with movable dividers for easier organization , and tilt-out freezer bins . You can place the appliances as standalones in different areas of the kitchen . In our tests , this combination proved very good overall . Temperature performance was excellent , and energy efficiency was very good . One caveat : The Kenmore units consume about 60 percent more electricity than the next largest refrigerator/ freezer we tested for this report , the LG LSC27950 , albeit with twice as much usable freezer space as the LG side-by-side . Some drawbacks : This duo was n't quiet , rating fair . Our measurements indicate combined usable capacity of 24 cubic feet ; claimed is 34 . And at a height of 65 inches , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $600 ) raises the height to 79 inches and creates a built-in look . This duo costs about $4,000 with the trim kit ( the refrigerator and freezer run about $1,700 each ) . Brand repair history . Feedback on 95,000 fridges The graphs show the percentage of refrigerators bought from 2002 to 2006 that underwent repair or had a serious problem . Differences of less than 5 points are not meaningful . Maytag was the most repair-prone top-freezer ; Sub-Zero has generally been repair-prone . Built-in bottom- freezers were more repair-prone than freestanding types . Models within a brand can vary , and design or manufacture changes could affect reliability . We lack sufficient data to report on LG . Improve your odds of getting a reliable model by buying a brand with a good repair history .
