<p> On a recent Saturday afternoon in San Rafael , fly-fishing instructor Floyd Dean was expertly casting and reeling , bending and swiveling at the edge of a 40-foot demonstration pool . <p> Twenty or so a-fish-ionados lined the pool , following his every move . It is a rite of spring in this Marin County parking lot  --  the annual Fly-Fishing Fair staged by Western Sport Shop , just across the street . <p> First , Dean demonstrated the " Wyoming cowboy , " twirling his rod in a lassolike motion above his head . " This'n ' ll get your ear , " he warned . <p> Next came the classic " willow cast , " featured in the movie , " A River Runs Through It . " Twenty rapt heads followed every move as the line plopped down gently at the end of the long pool . <p> The fair , which includes fly-tying demonstrations and booths with the latest fishing paraphernalia , is more than a sales opportunity for Western . Special events like this differentiate the 53-year-old retailer from discount chains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they help the independent shop stay afloat . <p> " It 's a small market , so any new competitor who makes a serious run at it will take some business , " said Jim Edgar , who has owned Western for the past 13 years with his wife , Judy . " Their margins will hurt and our margins will hurt . That 's happened several times , but then they go out of business and we survive . " <p> In addition to retail rivals , Western faces the challenge of declining interest in fishing and hunting . <p> The number of Americans who fished at least once in 1999 was 7 percent lower than in 1987 , while hunting was down 33.4 percent , according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association . By contrast , mountain-biking participation rose more than 400 percent , and snowboarding jumped 124 percent . <p> To counteract the downturn , Western offers frequent classes and seminars on topics like bay fishing and fly-tying . ( Flies are the insectlike lures , typically made from animal hair and feathers , that fly-fishers use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hires some of the biggest names in the esoteric world of fly-fishing , like Lefty Kreh and Dave Whitlock . <p> In the fall , Western 's annual Waterfowl Day , featuring decoys , shotguns , duck calls and other equipment , attracts flocks of bird hunters . <p> The store itself , with its high ceilings and timbered paneling , is a relic of the past . A piece of paper scrawled with the words " Bait &; Soda " is taped to a refrigerator in the back . Mounted heads of elk , deer and other game , many of them decades old , line every wall . <p> The heads " are too big for most people to keep in their homes , " so customers store them at Western , said Judy Edgar . " Sometimes customers come in to visit their heads . " <p> Western " is not a slick place " and that 's not the goal , said Jim Edgar . " We like to provide a unique shopping experience in an age when there are n't many . " <p> Despite its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the broadest and most up-to-date in the area . In addition to equipment , it stocks more than 5,000 titles of new and used outdoor books with titles like " In Praise of Wild Trout " and " Lunker ! " ( a type of bass ) . <p> " There are probably four shops in California that are really good and this is one of the best , " said Robert Louis Stephens , a fishing guide who manned a booth at the Fly-Fishing Fair . <p> Western 's customer service is old-fashioned , too , shoppers say . <p> " The guys are helpful , " said Darren Hesse , who attended the Fly-Fishing Fair . " They tell you where the hot fishing spots are , and their information is always good . " <p> None of Western 's employees receive commissions or any kind of incentive pay tied to sales . <p> " Frankly , we think that 's counter to the nature of the service we 're trying to deliver , " Jim Edgar said . It motivates people to sell stuff customers do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store we want to be . " <p> Western does give every employee Christmas bonuses , and managers receive annual bonuses based on subjective performance measures , but not sales , Edgar said . <p> Western , which occupies 5,000 square feet , has been riding high for the past couple of years . Sales rose 13 percent in 1998 and 18 percent in 1999 . Bay Area residents are flush with cash , and some are now dropping $1,000 or more to get completely outfitted for , say , a bone-fishing trip to the Caribbean . <p> Business has n't always been so good . When the Edgars bought Western in 1987 , the store had been in decline for several years . The fact that it still exists is a testament to the Edgars ' love of minding the store , rather than to its financial rewards . <p> Western 's founder , Gene Thompson , started the business in 1947 . It rapidly became a mecca for local outdoorsmen . He moved it to its current space on Third Street from its original Hayes Street location in 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembers that her father greeted every customer by name . A meticulous merchant , he insisted that she arrange bait fish in perfectly straight rows . <p> In the late 1970s , Thompson sold Western to two longtime employees . In the mid- ' 80s it was purchased by a construction-company executive , Al Perini , who soon decided that retailing was n't his sport . By that point , the store had very little inventory , its prices were a bit steep and it was losing money . <p> Perini mentioned his plan to sell the store to a fishing buddy , Jim Edgar , a lifelong management consultant with no background in retailing . The two were fishing for salmon at the time . <p> Edgar bit . " I 'll buy it , " he told his friend . Today he notes , " It was a decision of the heart , not the wallet . " <p> The Edgars installed their son , Jim Edgar Jr. , who had been manager of a camera store , as Western 's manager . Judy Edgar began organizing events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finances without leaving his consulting business , Edgar Dunn &; Co. , in San Francisco . <p> The Edgars made significant changes in the first few years , including reorganizing the floor plan , restocking depleted inventories , hiring more staff and putting more emphasis on fly-fishing . In its earlier incarnations , the store had focused mostly on hunting , a sport that has been declining in popularity in the Bay Area for years . <p> When their son left Western in 1995 for another retail job , Judy and Jim Edgar considered selling the store . But they were hooked . They resolved to keep going and asked a longtime employee , Gene Fassi , to manage day-to-day operations . <p> Revenues , which had doubled under Jim Edgar Jr. , have risen another 50 percent under Fassi . Fly-fishing is the fastest-growing category ; both hunting and other types of fishing are on the decline . <p> The Edgars ' persistance has been rewarded with black ink for the past three or four years , although profit margins remain thin , under 5 percent . ( They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angler , which is profitable ) . <p> Today , Western 's biggest challenge is to find knowledgeable employees with good people skills who are willing to work for a retail wage , said Jim Edgar . <p> As an incentive , Western lets full-timers work 10-hour days , four days a week  --  a schedule that allows staff to spend three days a week hunting and fishing . <p> Many new hires are high school students who work after school and retirees looking for something to do a couple of days a week , Edgar said . These folks do n't demand high wages and the old-timers have extraordinary stores of knowledge about local hunting and fishing spots , Edgar said . <p> Another looming challenge for Western is a 12-screen cinema in the works for downtown San Rafael . The theater would surround Western on two sides and engulf an adjacent parking garage used by Western customers . <p> " Parking is already difficult in San Rafael , " said Jim Edgar . He expects Western to survive if the theater is built , but business may suffer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bay Area that have been in business for at least 40 years .
