Convention be damned . If he 's going to take the Falcons to the Super Bowl , he 'll do it his way . Now , get out of his face . By Paul Attner // Were does Michael Vick fit ? That 's the problem we 've always ad with him and that he has had with himself . Playing a position defined by confining standards , he is a misfit . It 's easy to understand the quandary . The most honored quarterbacks possess special passing skills practiced mostly from within the comfort of a protected pocket . And here he is , blessed more with the gifts of a rare running back than with the qualities of a pure passer , stuck trying to carve out success in a league that does not necessarily have room for the unconventional . He knows he is special , always has . He entertains like no other player , accumulates memorable moments like few others , worries defenses like only rare athletes can . In just his fourth season , he led the Falcons to within one game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2004 ; just wait , we all thought , until he learns to pass more efficiently , stay in the pocket more , become more patient . All that was so wrong . He will never be a prototypical passer or excel at being patient , nor is he a man built to remain anchored . He knew all of that , too , but he would look at the lists of best quarterbacks and his name never seemed to be around the top . He heard what was being said . You ca n't win consistently with a quarterback who runs this much . You certainly ca n't win on those days when the rushing game is controlled and he 's forced to pass . And you 'll see . He wo n't last if he keeps exposing himself like this in the open field as an Inviting lure for ravenous defenders . So he listened and decided to heed . Last season , he tried to be more like the Mannings and Bradys and Palmers of the NFL world . The runs were still there , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them only if he embraced the pocket more enthusiastically and refused to bolt from pressure so quickly . How about that day against the Dolphins : 22-of-31 , 228 yards , a 102.6 passer rating-good enough for him to tell the world : Who says I can " the a pocket passer ? " I do n't know what the hell I was thinking , to be honest , " says Vick about his mind-set a year ago . He knows all too well the results of this image-reshaping : two injuries ( knee , hamstring ) and an 8-8 season in which the Falcons lost six of their last eight-including an embarrassing final-game loss to the Panthers in which he admits he did n't push himself . He made his third Pro Bowl , but it was a hollow achievement . " It was something I wanted to do , " he says about his attempted style remake . " I mean , I knew people were saying that the only way you are going to be perceived as a ( great ) quarterback is by staying in the pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why would I feed into that ? " His answer : No more feeding . If the frenzy over his style is to continue , he wo n't partake . " I am sick of people trying to tell me how to play my game , " he says . " Saying this is right or this is wrong and saying , " You need to do this or that " to be a complete quarterback . Whatever you want to say , whatever you want to think , whatever theory you have , I got mine . And that is to be me . " Being Michael Vick this season has meant conducting an offense in many ways so anti-NFL that sometimes you have to double-check to make sure you 're at a pro game . After four weeks-the Falcons were off last Sunday-Vick sat at No. 5 among rushing leaders , ahead of such elite running backs as LaDainian Tomlinson , Larry Johnson and Edgerrin James . He already has gone over 100 yards twice , extending his NFL record for quarterbacks to seven 100-yard career rushing games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a version of a college-college ! option play . And here are the Falcons at 3-1 , legitimate title contenders again , comfortably committed to chasing a Super Bowl without a conventional quarterback . " What you see now is going to be Mike Vick until the day I retire , to the day I am out of the league , " he says . " All the stuff I worried about ? It is gone . It is gone . Never to return . I ca n't try to be something I ca n't be . " If we needed a sign from the Falcons ' organization that everyone has finally , and forever , bought into the concept of Vick 's being unshackled as a running quarterback , it came early in the second quarter against the Bucs in Week 2 . Vick set up in the shotgun with Warrick Dunn to his side . Vick got the ball , took a step down the line with Dunn moving next to him and , sensing the defenders closing from the outside , handed the ball to his halfback . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained 13 yards . It was the first of eight snaps in which the Falcons would run plays from this scheme , now seen so frequently in college spread offenses . Vick would either hand off , fake and keep the ball , fake and pass it or bootleg it to the weak side . Almost every time , the scheme gouged the Bucs . This was Vince Young at Texas . But Vick in the NFL ? " We had to go to college to get the concept because it was n't there in the NFL , " says Falcons coordinator Greg Knapp . Last winter , Knapp was watching Georgia and West Virginia in the Sugar Bowl and noticed how the quarterbacks were used out of the shotgun . " We can do that , " he thought . Discussions with coaches from Ohio State and Florida solidified his belief . " We were doing the same stuff already but from behind the center , " he says . " But we were calling what Mike should do and sometimes we 'd say , " Gee , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . ' Now we 've empowered Mike with that decision making based on how he reads the defense . " The Falcons had employed this scheme a bit in the opener against Carolina . But the Bucs were n't prepared for an accelerated use of the package . It helped shatter what had been the No. 1 defense in the league last season . Vick rushed for 127 yards , Dunn had 134 , and the Falcons finished with a team-record 306 . " After playing him twice a year for five years , we thought we had a pretty good game plan for him , " says Bucs linebackers coach Joe Barry . " But he exposed us . He Is just a dangerous , dangerous human being . They caught us off-guard , using that option read . You throw that in-and they are a great running team anyway-and it just makes them so difficult to defense . " Part of the defensive uncertainty came about because of how Vick played in 2005 . " I think he got so caught up in having to prove to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and throw it , " says Barry . " You could see times when he would start to take off and then stop and say , " No , I want to throw it to prove people wrong . ' But against us , he said , " Screw It . If I drop back and my first and second reads are n't there , I am out of here . ' That is when he is scary . We 'd have them in third-and-10 , and he would take off like a freakin ' Jet and make the first down . " Vick now is much less stubborn in his decision making at the end of runs , and that is reducing the Injury risk and eliminating what general manager Rich McKay calls " the angst we once had over how much he ran . He knows now how to end the journey , unlike before . " On almost every one of his 38 carries this season , Vick has run out of bounds or fallen to avoid an open-field tackle . " I used to run into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sore shoulders all of 2002 because of that . At times when I was supposed to be getting out of bounds , I was trying to cut it back inside and break a long run . I was greedy . I paid the price for it , and I learned . I want to make plays . But I have learned sometimes you accept what you got , go back to the huddle and do it again . " Now coach Jim Mora tells him before every game , " Do what you do . If that means run every down , then do it . Run when you feel like running it and hock it when you feel like hocking it . " Hocking it ? " Pass it ; just let it go ; do n't hesitate , " says Mora . " Be Michael Vick . " But to be Michael Vick , Super Bowl winner , that passing part still needs to grow . " You score points and win championships by being able to throw the ball , " says SPORTING NEWS and FOX analyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenses , he has to be able to show he can pass . " It will never be a normal passing attack with Vick . So many of his throws now come off rollouts , where he has more room to run if necessary . That brings an unevenness to what the Falcons do . His passing options are limited on movement plays to one part of the field , which makes his attempts easier to defend . And his completion percentage is hindered by other factors : his inconsistent accuracy , too many drops and an emphasis on throwing it away more frequently to avoid hits and big losses . He has attempted to improve . In the offseason , he trained and studied more strenuously , working with new quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave , who quickly won Vick 's confidence . The Falcons say his route anticipation , quickness of release and desire to go deeper into reads all are more impressive . Still , Atlanta 's passing production is n't good enough . Vick does n't need to be the next Dan Marino ; he just has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attempts ( the Falcons would like it to be 55 ) with a woeful 69.8 passer rating . The passing deficiencies have been particularly glaring in the red zone , where the Falcons have scored only three touchdowns in 17 opportunities . It has n't helped that their field-goal kicking was so atrocious they signed old man Morten Andersen . The Falcons spent a good chunk of owner Arthur Blank 's money in the offseason to upgrade their defense , which has put them in position to make a championship run . But with opponents crowding the line to stop the No. 1 rushing offense , Vick has to take advantage of play-action and deep-throw opportunities to make them back off and respect the passing game . Then maybe we 'll finally see whether young receivers Roddy White and Michael Jenkins were worthy first-round picks . " I think they can win a Super Bowl with Mike , " Baldinger says . " If Brad Johnson and Trent Dilfer can get a ring , I believe Mike can do it , too . All he does is win . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the run is taken away . " For Mora , it 's simple : Do n't judge Vick as you do other quarterbacks . " Change is hard for people to accept , " he says . " Peyton Manning and Tom Brady , they are the prototypical quarterbacks , and that is how it is supposed to be done . But that does n't mean it ca n't be done another way . There always will be criticism of Michael because he is different , and it wo n't stop until he wins a Super Bowl . That will validate who he is and what he does . " The difference in Vick extends off the field , too . At 26 , he has matured and is much more at ease , more outgoing than he has been ; he can laugh at himself behind nice deadpan humor . But like most superior athletes , there is an edge to his personality and more than a touch of defensiveness , even if expressed in a soft-spoken way . He certainly is a contrast to the button-down look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip-hop fashion , with long T-shirts , low-hanging baggy shorts , sunglasses and a medallion around his neck , hair in cornrows and pigtails . Atlanta is the center of hip-hop music , and Vick counts among his friends the biggest stars in that industry . Whether his look hinders his ability to gain endorsements and proper recognition for his talents concerns some within the Falcons ' organization . Given his electrifying playing style and his popularity among fans , it makes no sense that in the latest SportsBusiness Daily survey of most marketable NFL players , Vick was ranked ninth , behind even Terrell Owens ( eighth ) . " If you do n't fit , the way I feel , I am not accepted , " Vick says . " I look at it , a lot of the commercials with other players , little things I pick up on , things I am not included in ... I do n't know . I think I have revolutionized the position already and now there are going to be other Mike Vicks after me . At least I hope they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . I love the NFL ; I appreciate being a part of it . I want to play a long time . I Just wish people would back off Mike Vick a bit . " Sidebar Because Vick is decidedly less reckless at the end of his journeys from the pocket , the Falcons have punched his ticket to go . Sidebar " Whatever theory you have , I got mine . And that is to be me . ' Sidebar RUSHING TO THE TOP After four games , Michael Vick is averaging 83.3 rushing yards a game , which puts him on pace to surpass Bobby Douglass ' season record for a quarterback easily . Vick 's pace projects to 1,332 yards , which most running backs would gladly embrace . He also is stalking John Elway , who Is fifth in career rushing by a quarterback . Vick needs just 255 more yards to pass Elway , and if he continues at his career clip of 51 yards a game , he will become the all-time leader in only 35 more games . - P.A. // <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
