The airline practice of allowing young children to fly seated on an adult 's lap was criticized last week when the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that kids under age 2 be restrained in their own seats while in the air . So far , the Federal Aviation Administration has declined to make that mandatory , citing a 1995 study that concluded the added cost of buying another ticket might force more families to drive  --  and risk roadway accidents . Still , the agency advises that children weighing less than 40 lbs . fly in a safety or car seat buckled into their own seat on the plane . If you decide to get your toddler a seat , ask the airline whether it gives discounts on tickets for children under 2 ; many offer up to half off . When flying internationally , parents should check with each airline , since the rules vary greatly . Icelandair and Lufthansa , for example , do n't allow the use of safety seats during takeoff and landing , while Alitalia bans them altogether and charges an extra fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
