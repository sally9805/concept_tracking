1 Edric knew he should head for home . It would be dark soon , and even though he was as familiar with his part of the forest as he was with the back and the front of his hand , there were dangers when the lights went out-wild animals , evil spirits , big glowing eyes attached to who-knew-what , stuff like that . But Beelzebub and Hecate were having such a good time sniffing under every bush and barking all the grouse out from their hiding places that Ed was reluctant to spoil their fun . Besides , he 'd been having a very good day of gathering . Some days there was nothing ; nobody passing through the forest dropped a thing . But today he 'd found a ring with a big shiny pink stone , a collapsible telescope , a book of Greek myths , an almost-new leather jerkin , and a flask half full ( he knew there were some people who would have said half empty ) of a quite palatable wine-rather frisky , with some floral notes and a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a very good day indeed . He heard the dogs yapping their heads off up ahead . Not an encouraging sign . He could tell Bub was working himself into a state , trying to act as fierce as he looked , and Cate was overemoting , as usual . Whatever they were barking at must have gone straight up a tree , taken off for parts unknown , or had a coronary . " Hey , you guys ! " Ed yelled . " Cut that out ! " He came through the trees and saw the two dogs-big shaggy Beelzebub and petite well-groomed Hecate-in front of a clump of bushes , carrying on as if they did n't have a brain in either of their heads . " Hey ! " he yelled again . " Stop that ! " Abruptly they stopped barking . But both noses were pointed at the bushes , both tails out straight and quivering . " What 's in there ? " Ed asked nervously . The light was fading through the trees , casting long shadows that wavered and fooled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or maybe the shadows were n't fooling at all . " Come on , " Edric said in a low voice . " Let 's go home . " The dogs did n't move . " Would you listen to me ? " he pleaded , peering anxiously around as the light grew dimmer . If only he 'd thought to bring along some squirrel knuckles , their favorite treat , he could have lured them away easily . He was n't supposed to be snaring squirrels , of course , since these were King Swithbert 's woods , or maybe King Beaufort's-it was hard to tell where the boundaries between the two kingdoms lay-but who was going to miss a few squirrels when there were so many ? Well , the other squirrels , maybe , but he did n't let himself think about that . Hayes Centaur , King Swithbert 's gamekeeper , was conscientious ( unlike King Beaufort 's more laid-back Claypool Sasquatch ) and would love nothing better than to catch Edric poaching a squirrel , but even he could n't keep count of all the squirrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaufort 's . Ed pushed his way between the dogs , who were quivering so hard that they sent up a faint hum . He extended the collapsible telescope and poked it gingerly into the bushes . " Hello ? " he said tentatively . " Hello , " came a small voice . Edric and the dogs jumped in unison . " Who 's in there ? " Ed demanded gruffly , hoping he sounded seven feet tall instead of his actual three feet , four inches . " Me , " came the small voice . And a handsome little boy with big brown eyes and tousled brown hair-a few leaves clinging haphazardly to it-stuck his head out of the bushes . " Will those dogs eat me ? " he asked solemnly . Edric was so relieved , his knees went weak . " Naw , " he said . " This one " - he put his hand on Beelzebub 's shaggy neck and felt the dog 's shivers of terror- " is a coward who hides behind his big bark . And this one " - he scratched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the center of attention . " Cate wagged her plumy tail vigorously and grinned . " Who are you ? " the boy asked , crawling farther out of the bushes . " Edric 's my name . But mostly I 'm called Ed . And who are you ? " " Christian , " the boy said . " I 'm six . " " Well , come out of there , Christian , and tell me what you 're doing here . " Christian crawled all the way out from the bushes and stood up . " I 'm almost as big as you , " he said , surprised . Ed pulled himself to his full height . " I 'm tall for a troll , " he said defensively . " I 've never met a troll before , " Christian said . Ed stuck out his hand and shook Christian 's . " Now you have . And what about you ? " " I 'm a boy , " Christian said seriously . " Ca n't you tell ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to know is , where are your folks ? It 's almost dark out here . " " I do n't know where they are now . They looked for me for a long time , but their voices got farther and farther away until I could n't hear them at all . " " You mean you were hiding from them ? " Ed asked . " Why ? " " I do n't want to live with them anymore . It 's too hard . " " So you thought you 'd live in the forest ? Do you have any idea how hard that would be for somebody wearing a ... a ... What is that ? A velvet suit ? " " What should I wear instead ? " " What I mean is , somebody like you does n't know anything about living in a forest . That cup of tea is definitely not down your alley , if you know what I mean . What would you do for shelter ? Food ? Heat ? Protection ? " " I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has berries on it . " Ed rolled his eyes . " I can see I 'm beating my head against a dead horse . There are berries now because it 's summer . There wo n't be any in a few more weeks . " He considered for about half a second and then said , " You 'd better come home with me . I can take you back to your folks in the morning . " Christian 's lower lip came out . " I 'll go with you now , but I wo n't go home in the morning . I do n't even know where home is . " Ed put his hand on Christian 's shoulder . " Let 's get out of here . It 'll be pitch-dark in a few minutes , and I do n't want to run into any more surprises . We can finish this conversation once we 're inside . Come on , Bub . Get going , Cate . Let 's get this show on the ball . " Cate scampered ahead , throwing herself into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to Ed , could feel a sick headache coming on-he always got one after he 'd had to be brave-and he could hardly wait to flop down in front of the fire and pull himself together . " What 's that shiny blue stuff up there ? " Christian asked after they 'd wound along narrow rutted paths for a while , doing their bests not to run into any trees , fall in any streams , or become supper for anything else wandering around out there . " Where ? " Ed asked . " Oh , yeah . Great ! That 's the cave . We 're almost home . " The dogs ran ahead and disappeared into the shadows . " You live in a cave ? " Christian asked . " Why is it blue ? " " It 's blue , and red , and green , and pink , and purple , and yellow , too , " Ed said . " It 's a big cave with lots of rooms , and in each room the walls and ceilings are studded with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they glow in the dark . Kind of pretty , do n't you think ? " " Yeah , " Christian breathed as they approached . " It looks like magic . " " Well , maybe it is . I do n't know of another cave like it . When I discovered it , the entrance was all blocked by rocks and dirt . I was sick of being a nomad and knew I 'd finally found my home . Trolls have to spend at least one hundred years of their lives in a cave ; did you know that ? It 's a tradition . I 've been here , oh , must be one hundred and seventeen years now . " In the large yellow-crystal room that Ed used for his main parlor , he built up the fire , stumbling repeatedly over Bub , who was laid out in front of it like a hearth rug , breathing deeply in relief at being safe at home . For supper there was leftover raccoon ragout , seasoned with wild garlic , onion , parsley , sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new strawberries and the wine Ed had found that day . When it was all gone , Ed let out a satisfied burp . Christian imitated him and giggled . " If I did that at home , I 'd be sent to my room , " he said . " Actually , I 'd be dragged off to my room , probably by my ear . " A bit drastic for a burp , Ed thought , but maybe he 'd lived in a cave for so long he 'd lost whatever social graces he might once have had . " And you can forget about taking me back there , " Christian went on . " I 'm tired of being told what to do , and of being too clean , and of not being able to make a mess . Inventing is messy , and that 's what I like to do . My parents will be glad I 'm gone . " " I thought they searched for you all afternoon . " " Oh , they 'll forget about me pretty soon . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father never listens to me . And Mother only cares about how clean I am-and I 'm never clean enough . The rest of the time she just wants to play bezique and piquet with her lady friends . " Ed could see there was no point in arguing with this kid . He figured he could manage to put up with the little squirt for one night and then he 'd track down the parents and hand him over . " Come on , " he said . " It 's late . You can wear this for a nightshirt . " He handed the boy a shirt of thin cambric that he had found beside a pond . Well , he had to admit he could see the owner of the shirt splashing in the pond , but he 'd left him his boots and his breeches , had n't he ? What else did a body need to get home in on a warm summer day ? Ed made a bed for Christian out of furs in the dark-blue-crystal room . Sleeping in there was like sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around you . The little boy looked quite happy bedded down in the furs , the sleeves of his nightshirt rolled up four and a half times . As soon as he put his head down , both dogs came padding in to flop on either side of him . With an arm around each furry neck , he murmured sleepily , " You can throw that stupid velvet suit away . I 'm never wearing it again . " Then his eyes closed , and three sets of soft snores rose to the shining ceiling . " Who does he think he is ? " Ed muttered , picking up the trail of discarded clothing as he went back to the fire in the yellow-crystal room . " Imperious little son of a gun , acting like some big cheese in a small pond , expecting me to pick up after him like I was his servant . " He dropped the clothing in front of the fire and sat on the picnic rug he 'd found years before , way over on King Beaufort 's side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly ; he could tell that much from the scattered plates and utensils and food . Not that there was much food left . Whatever animal had come upon the picnickers had enjoyed the meal more than they had . But Ed had enjoyed the kitchenware , the hamper , the big napkins embroidered with the letter B , and the rug , all of which he 'd hauled home . He shook out each small item of clothing and dusted it off . As he folded the velvet shorts , he heard a faint tinkle . In the pocket he found a gold chain with a golden charm hanging from it . The charm was in the shape of a bird unlike any Ed had ever seen in the forest , though that certainly did n't mean it did n't exist . The world was full of fantastical creatures . The bird seemed to be part pheasant and part eagle . Ed returned the chain to the pocket . Under other circumstances he would have added it to his collection , but he had a feeling the kid 's parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stack of clothing in one of the big picnic napkins , stashed the bundle in the hamper , and settled down with his briar pipe and the book of Greek myths . Nothing like a little fratricide , patricide , matricide , and infanticide to send a fellow right off to sleep .
