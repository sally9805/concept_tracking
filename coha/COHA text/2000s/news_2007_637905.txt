<p> Denial . Anger . Bargaining . Depression . Acceptance . Psychiatrist and author Elisabeth Kubler-Ross ' five stages of grieving have been playing out before our eyes in the unlikeliest of places : the baseball diamond . The sport is trying to come to grips with San Francisco Giant Barry Bonds breaking Hank Aaron 's all-time home run record that has stood for three decades . <p> When Aaron eclipsed Babe Ruth 's record with his 715th homer in 1974 , it was an iconic moment that electrified the world . When Bonds breaks Aaron 's record of 755 , it will be an iconic moment , but only because it will have come in the Steroid Era . Bonds has been stained by steroids allegations , as have scores of Major Leaguers . <p> Baseball is in a funk over what many view as a tragedy for the game . So let 's find a way toward acceptance so that fans can once again embrace the national pastime . One step at a time , after all . <p> Denial : Bonds has flatly denied ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with each passing month , it seems another star player fesses up . Other players say they ca n't discern fellow Major Leaguers bulking up in unnatural ways , yet somehow they can track a pitch at 95 mph . <p> " I do n't know how you can have that swing , consistently , " Red Sox slugger David Ortiz told the Boston Herald about Bonds . " I do n't know how steroids can do that . " <p> The reaction of most ballplayers to Bonds ' pursuit of Aaron is reminiscent of nine seasons ago , when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa chased Roger Maris ' single-season home run record . That 's when whispers of steroid use became front-page news . Yet instead of an investigation , McGwire 's manager , Tony La Russa , wanted to ban The Associated Press from his clubhouse , according to Howard Bryant 's book Juicing the Game : Drugs , Power , and the Fight for the Soul of Major League Baseball . <p> A survey of Major League players by USA TODAY and The Sports Xchange found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best slugger ever . Yet only 8% of fans in a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll agree . <p> Anger : " I think I know who did steroids , and their records will never ring true to me , " said Brooks Robinson , Hall of Fame third baseman with the Baltimore Orioles . " I think it is troubling for a lot of us . " <p> Former players  --  notably those from the Steroid-Free Era  --  have become increasingly outspoken about the role of performance-enhancing drugs in their sport . Dale Murphy , a two-time Most Valuable Player with the Atlanta Braves , described Bonds as someone who " went down the wrong path . " <p> This sense of betrayal spills over into the bleachers , too . You need only peer into the crowd for signs castigating Bonds or read fan blogs to understand the depth of their disdain . Mike Jenkins , blogging on AOL Sports , writes that when Bonds enters the National Baseball Hall of Fame , " All I want to see is ( an asterisk ) next to his name . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consensus during his nine-year tenure as commissioner , but he appears to have run out of options with Bonds . So how to handle the inevitable ? Former commissioner Fay Vincent has advised Selig to be conspicuously absent when Aaron 's record falls . Vincent says Selig 's presence would be an endorsement of Bonds and the Steroid Era . <p> But what happens next is as important as what 's happening today . Baseball appears to be serious about cracking down on the use of performance-enhancing drugs by suspending repeat offenders for an entire season . In addition , the sport is testing for amphetamines . <p> Selig knows baseball is stuck with its juiced past , but he seems to understand that the only way to heal today 's wounds is by restoring the sport to its pure form . <p> Depression : Last year , when Bonds hit his 714th homer , tying Ruth 's record , the fan who caught it was asked whether he planned to give the ball to the Giants slugger . " Probably not , " Tyler Snyder said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging their heads and bracing for The Day The Record Falls ? Probably not . But the Bonds chase that looms over an otherwise uneventful regular season is the equivalent of a long walk to the sports gallows . That 's because baseball will have lost its sense of history along with what was left of its innocence . What has long separated the national pastime from other sports is the ability to compare stars through the ages . That 's next to impossible in football or basketball . Those games have changed too much . But in baseball , we 've been able to debate who 's the better fire-baller pitcher , Bob Feller or Nolan Ryan . Who 's the ultimate slugger , Ruth or Aaron ? That ends with Bonds . <p> Acceptance : During the 1998 home run chase , I visited Aaron at Atlanta 's Turner Field . Our discussion was about home runs : what it feels like to hit one , what it 's like to hit so many in a Hall of Fame career . <p> Aaron 's office overlooked left field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Why do ( today 's players ) feel they have to hit them so far ? My home runs went three , five rows into the seats . No more than that . The ones they hit today go so much farther , some out of the ballpark . I wonder why ? " <p> His tone was whimsical , even slightly facetious . But I 'm guessing Aaron knew the answer . We all do . <p> Once No. 756 flies into the bleachers and the record books , though , we can close this dark chapter in baseball 's rich history . After all , if we can get past the 1919 Black Sox , numerous work stoppages and Pete Rose 's penchant for gambling , ca n't we get past this ? <p> Tim Wendel is a member of USA TODAY 's board of contributors .
