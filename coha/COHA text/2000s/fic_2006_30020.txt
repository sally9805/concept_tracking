Sunday , May 15. 11:00 a.m. vCaMV . Mottled gold on green , like the shimmer of foil or the gleam on a sheen of motor oil , the plant looked unhealthy from stalk to leaves . Systemic cell death . Vein clearing and branding , which appeared as dark varicose veins shooting across withered leaves . Classic . " This ai n't happening , " Stark said . He scanned up the row , looking for more infected spinach plants . His grandfather 's method of defense against vCaMV was to change up the varieties throughout the rows , planting no two plants of the same variety within ten feet of each other , which made for jagged , uneven growth and shaggy rows . Had the method broken down here ? Stark could see the Bloomsdale spinaches , the Olympia , the Sailorman , de Wilde Savoy , and the Oklahoma Green , alternating through the rows . To outsiders , the seemingly haphazard plan looked like madness , but " gold mold , " as the array of variants of cauliflower mosaic virus was commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fedora to block the sun , Stark knelt and clipped a small leaf from the young spinach and slipped it into his field press . " May 15 , " he said to the press , as it sighed nitrogen , enclosed the sample , and consulted with the NIA satellite . A moment later , the field press confirmed the obvious . vCaMV was here , on this farm , the place he grew up . He stood and looked across Nissevalle Valley . The greenhouses had been emptied of sprouts , and fields were planted and primed for summer storms and sun . For nearly two decades , farms from Alberta to Chihuahua had battled seasonal vCaMV outbreaks for meager yields . Gold mold was known to sweep through whole regions in a single season , like a slow-motion prairie fire . But it had never come to Nissevalle . This quop was poised for another very profitable year , and losing shares now would be a disaster . Spinach rippled with passes of May breeze , and so did the corn , low and fluttering . Field hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tillers dogged behind , maneuvering through the tomatoes on preprogrammed weeding missions . The idyllic haze of Nissevalle Farm suddenly looked like so much rot . " Jesus , " he whispered . " It really here . " After eighteen years away from this farm , Henry David Stark was still getting himself apace with death 's routine visits here . It was one thing to behold it in a hot zone , or an anonymous hospital , but another entirely to see death pass between the paddocks and hay barns of his childhood . Yesterday morning in the creamery , loud with lowing and meowing and the mechanical gasp of milkers , a heavy-headed cow swung her face away from bright headlights shooting suddenly through the dawn 's fog and stepped backwards with a stomping hoof , catching a small kitten unawares . Stark had cried out , trying to scare the cat from danger . But blink . Gone . Then , last night in the goat barn , Stark watched as three kids , slick with blood , slid out of their nanny 's body , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . Stark was surprised how such small passings troubled him , after what he 'd seen in , say , China 's Borna outbreak . But he 'd left the CDC 's Special Pathogens Unit to take charge of its Surveillance and Response Central Command two years ago , in order to distance himself from death 's rhythms . In bringing the Central Command ( that is , himself ) to the co-op farm last January , it was inevitable that he 'd synchronize himself with death -- yet again . The biggest rhythm of all , however , was the one that pounded straight to the brink -- the farm 's end . It was always there , that deadly rhythm -- hail , a tornado , financial ruin -- but as a boy , he never listened to it . Standing over the dying spinach plant , Stark felt that countless days on a farm could never make it ordinary . As he began thumbing information about the spinach 's variety and location into the field press , a stylized , red asterisk appeared before his eyes , eclipsing the LED display and his fingertips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinach field to his grandfather , who was just now returning from disking up the green manure field on his International . But the field hands would hear , and most of them had lost their own farms to vCaMV . Yelling that he 'd found gold mold would be like shouting fire in a burn ward . Instead , he took off his hat and waved it over his head . The red asterisk pulsed across his vision again . Congo 's yellow fever , probably . Maybe the vaccination program 's net had n't been cast wide enough , and Queen Mum was alerting him to the need for more stockpiles . Stark glanced at the field hands working their way toward the spinach fields . On a quop farm like this one , everyone was judged by their work . It had always been that way , even from Stark 's childhood , when he could n't wait to get out of the Junior League gardens and show that he could work with the adults . Even with the CDC calling for him , Stark did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled up on the International Harvester he called Methuselah . A tall man , sturdy as a two-by-four , Grandfather 's skin was so dark he seemed made of wood -- and thanks to the krono he 'd received in his forties , he looked half his ninety-one years . " What 's shaking ? " he said over the blatting engine , hands resting on the steering wheel . His heavy work gloves looked absurd with such skinny wrists sticking out of them . " Shaking ? " Stark shouted back . He rarely understood his grandfather 's anachronisms . Or at least , he pretended not to . " Did you find something ? " Grandfather asked from atop the Harvester , older , even , than the man driving it . The tractor wafted an enticing smell toward Stark : cut cover , a green and nourishing smell . Grandfather 's cover crops of choice were buckwheat and oats , and he 'd just tilled a field of them into the dirt , where they would compost and enrich the soil . Grandfather also claimed it was a defense against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases . " Look , I hate to leave , " said Stark , smelling green buckwheat as his grandfather cut the engine . " We all just started , but I got to check in with Mum . " While the tractor gave a protracted cough as it tried to fall silent , a red asterisk lit before Stark 's eyes again . Red ( as opposed to blue or yellow ) usually meant that the Queen Mum was simply alerting him to an emergency . But when Stark blinked at this one to clear his vision , an urgent was waiting for him . He 'd be able to read it on the interface in his contact lens 's receiver , but he would n't be able to save the message or respond to it . It was a one-time shot . Whoever sent this message was desperate and had formatted it so that Stark would receive it without having to use his " brain gear "  - -  a high-ranking official in a major health organization in dire need of speaking with Stark directly . While his grandfather slid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the message . Sunday 15 May URGENT , Attention Dr. Henry Stark , the Ministry of Well-being of the Holy Renaissance is not negotiating this outbreak with momentous etiquette . The message would only be available for a few moments , but he took the time to reread that . Even after a third read , the sentence still made no sense to him . Grandfather realized that Stark was n't paying attention to him . " What ? Bad news ? " Stark did n't answer . Minister Alejandro bore into the kingdom two WHO virologists , but they are commencing on untrue discoveries . This dengue is not dengue . It is not allocated by small flying beasts . Please touch me as soon as possible . I am the unique man witnessing reality . Urgent . Dr. Pedro Mu-oz . Stark pursed his lips , frustrated . The Central Command 's surveillance and response software was falling apart , obviously . " Look , I got to check in . " " I know that , " Grandfather said , slipping off his gloves . Stark gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You start blinking hard right after you get your bat signal , " said Grandfather , gloves in one hand , the other resting on his hip . " Plus , it 's the only time I actually see you look nervous about anything . " Stark smiled . He liked that , though he imagined it was n't the Code Red that made him look nervous . " Something else you should know , " said Stark . " Oh ? " How to say it ? Was it possible to break such news gently ? This was a model farm in many ways , from its Land Reform cooperative structure to its success against vCaMV . In the corner of his eye , the infected plant fluttered like a green fire . Finally , he simply handed Grandfather the field press . " It all in here . " Grandfather took the press without opening it . " Why a doctor of your caliber , upon whom the whole world depends , elects to speak like a backwoods hick is beyond me . Whatever happened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a sour voice . " It clumsy . " " ' It is all in here . ' Say it . " " ' It is all in here , ' " Stark said in a grand English accent , slipping halfheartedly into their old banter . His eyes flitted to the field press . " I got to go . " He turned and ran up the gravel drive to the manor , feeling as though he 'd activated the timer on a grenade and shoved it in his grandfather 's hands . Nissevalle Manor was a four-story mansion built with Land Reform earnings ten years ago , and it housed the fifty-three working members of the quop . The house stood on a small bluff overlooking the farm 's barns and sheds , the quilt of five-acre private fields , and the much larger , hundred-acre cooperative fields sprawling against the southern hill faces in this valley . Stark ran up the dirt road from the spinach field and past the penetrating stench of the poultry barn , then yanked open the back door . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon frying . Dalia the Kitchen Czarina was feeding the early crew down in the dining hall after their shift , and as he ascended the spiral staircase to the fourth floor , Stark could hear a friendly argument about milk prices in the first-floor buyer 's den , someone singing ( badly ) in a shower , the whine of the house pooch , an e-phone ringing on the second floor , the three Wheeler kids speaking in their imaginary language , a tractor 's sudden bleat from the barn , laughter , chimes , a dripping faucet . The cacophony of home . Stark 's fourth-floor room looked west over the members ' private fields . An afterthought of a cubbyhole in the unfinished , pinewood hall , it was icy in winter , broiling in summer , and Stark knew the quop had given it to him because nobody else wanted it . He did n't complain . As a CDC administrator , Stark did n't bring much to the daily workings of a farm . Sure , he was an intern , a weeder when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for the last twenty years instead of accepting the Junior League 's scholarship for college when he was eighteen , he would have been a coordinator with years of experience in the quop by now . His choice of rooms . A senior share at profit disbursement . But now he always had one foot planted in the outside world -- in the Congo , or in the vast urban outbreaks that blossomed from Kazakhstan to Kirkuk . Stark knew that he was occupying a space that might better be filled by a farmer , so small as his room was , he was grateful that the quop was willing to house him at all . Stark opened his bedroom door and swung his canvas bag onto the floor , ready to grab his brain gear , park his rump in the rocking chair , and contact the Command Center 's satellite . But he stopped short , hand still on the doorknob , as he realized that someone was standing in the middle of his room . Half in surprise , half in greeting , Stark said , " Hey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden flash of alarm . It was Earl , the new arrival from Baltimore -- a big , strapping fellow with forearms the size of bread loaves . As their eyes met , Stark was about to step backwards into the hall , but Earl seemed more frightened of Stark . " Oh . Hello , " he said . " I --  " " What going on ? " said Stark . " Why you in my room ? " " Pardon me , please , " said Earl , his bush of black hair bobbing as he took a step toward Stark and the door . " I think I in the wrong room . " Stark snorted in mockery . Everyone knew that new arrivals like Earl stayed with the nonmember interns in the first-floor dorm . With gold mold still wiping out farms every summer , even experienced field hands were lucky to get a membership here . " I think you knew you ai n't in the right room . " Stark 's eyes darted to his brain gear , still dangling like a rubber squid on his rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the discs and his memboard sat , just as he 'd left them last night . His only valuables had n't been touched or taken . " What you want in here ? " Earl looked honestly shocked and embarrassed . " Nothing . I promise . I --  " He took a step toward Stark and the door . Stark blocked his way . " Come on . What you doin here ? You did n't steal nothing that I can --  " " No . Search me if you like . " Earl raised his hands . " I ai n't no thief . " " Then what you want ? " Earl 's face colored . " I met a girl . She told me she lived up on the fourth floor . I thought this was --  " " You lie good , " Stark said . " But you lyin . " His fists clenched in anger -- and fear , as he contemplated what this huge man could do to him if things got rough . " You looking for the head of Surveillance and Response , ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't long , but Earl paused and blinked , and Stark knew that he 'd hit the mark . " No , this girl said --  " " Well , you found me , " said Stark . He spread his hands and let them flop to his sides . " Now what ? You obviously do n't want to interfere with me , or hurt me , or you 'd a done it already . Might as well tell me who you 're with . " Earl sighed and apparently decided he was done with the act and done with Stark , shoving him aside with a hard sweep of his arm . " Go downstairs and pack up , " Stark shouted at Earl 's back , following him to the stairwell and yelling after the man as he ran down the steps . " Gon na see to it you get kicked out ! Tonight ! " Earl picked up speed , running downstairs , but then he stopped and stuck his head into the center of the spiral staircase , looking up at Stark . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer looking for a handout from your grampa ? " " You the one runnin . " Earl grinned wolfishly up at him , and said , " I ai n't the first to get inside your room , Dr. Stark of the CDC . " Then he started trotting down the stairs again , saying , " And I wo n't be the last . " From the Trade Paperback edition . Continues ...
