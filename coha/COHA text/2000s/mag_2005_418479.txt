" Old age " and " retirement " must be rethought and redefined as the baby boomers surge through the later stages of life , according to a renowned authority on aging . // With the breakthroughs in medicine , public health , nutrition , and wellness in recent years , longevity has been steadily increasing . So what age should now be considered old ? Let 's remember that the age selected to be the marker of old age was not sent from heaven or scripted in Moses ' tablets . It was selected in the 188Os by Otto von Bismarck , who Grafted Europe 's first pension plan . Bismarck had to pick an age at which people would be considered too enfeebled to work and therefore eligible for state support and entitlement . He picked 65 . At the time , the life expectancy in Europe and the United States was only 45 years . Now , life expectancy at birth for women has vaulted to nearly 80 and for men to about 74 . In fact , if you were to craft a formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at about 97 . So to continue to use 65 as the marker of old age simply does not make any sense at all . One misconception that people have about longevity is that it means more years added to the end of life . Pew people would say , " If I could live longer , what I 'd really like is to be old for twice as long . " Rather , most people would say , " If I could live a little bit longer , I 'd like to have a chance to reinvent myself . I 'd like to have a chance to pursue some dreams that I might have put on the shelf when I was younger . I 'd like to adjust the balance between work , leisure , and family , with the benefit of the kind of wisdom and experience that comes from having tried a few things out in the first half of my life . " People do n't want to be old longer . They want to be young and middle-aged longer . And many would prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , reflecting a new kind of ageless aging . Photograph // The Longevity Revolution : We 've Only Just Begun During the twentieth century , we did an excellent job of eliminating many of the diseases of youth , such as cholera , typhoid , smallpox , diphtheria , and pneumonia . Childbirth , once a major cause of premature death , has become safer for most women , and more children are born healthier . The effect of these improvements is that more of us are living longer and longer . Extraordinary advances are still ahead . The maximum biological potential age of the human body is somewhere between 120 and 140 years , so with significant breakthroughs in the next quarter century-whether they be in pharmaceuticals , hormone therapy , therapeutic cloning , or stem-cell research-we could add another five , 10 , or even 20 years to a person 's life . The downside , of course , is that chronic health problems will also increase . We 're living longer but not necessarily staying healthy longer . Unfortunately , 59 million Americans have one form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population is overweight . Up to 50 million people struggle with chronic pain due to conditions like arthritis and bursitis . There are about 18 million people with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes . These lifestylerelated chronic diseases have become the modern plagues . In an ancient Greek fable , Eos , the beautiful goddess of the dawn , falls in love with the warrior Tithonus . Distraught over his mortality , she goes to Zeus 's chamber and begs Zeus to grant her lover immortality . " Are you certain that is what you want for him ? " Zeus challenges . " Yes , " Eos responds . As Eos leaves Zeus 's chamber , she realizes in shock that she forgot to ask that Tithonus also remain eternally young and healthy . With each passing year , she looks on with horror as he grows older and sicker . His skin withers and becomes cancerous . His organs rot , and his brain grows feeble . Ultimately , the once-proud warrior is reduced to a collection of pained , foul , and broken bones-but he continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Purdue University graduate student Tetyana Pylypiv ( right ) is studying the lifestyle transitions of older adults for a new doctoral program combining gerontology and sociology . // The story of Tithonus is a fitting allegory for what is occurring in the U.S. health-care system today . While we have eliminated many of the childhood diseases that took our ancestors ' lives , the health-care system is woefully inept at preventing or treating the chronic health problems that arise in life 's later years . Agerelated chronic conditions such as Alzheimer 's disease , arthritis , osteoporosis , diabetes , prostate and breast cancer , and heart disease are reaching pandemic proportions . The most troublesome challenges ahead , however , could be due to the rising incidence of the diseases among the oldest of the old . Although some of today 's over-85 population are fit and independent , 62.5% are so disabled that they are no longer able to manage the basic activities of daily living without help . Currently , 47% of people over age 85 suffer from some form of dementia-a condition that already afflicts 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in promoting the wellness movement since its beginnings 30 years ago , I am convinced that we could all be doing a much better job of both lowering health-care costs and creating a much healthier , more vital , independent life by practicing better health habits . With each birthday , the body struggles with a wider range of problems . For example , I am 55 . I am a relatively healthy and fit person , but I 've got a right shoulder that 's troubled with bone spurs and arthritis . And even though I have n't eaten meat for about 25 years , I have high cholesterol that I grapple with . I also find that it 's a little easier to gain weight now than when I was younger , so I 'm always trying to keep an eye out for my calorie consumption . So even though I am still a youthful , healthy person , each birthday brings on more challenges to work against on a day-to-day basis . When we 're young , we tend to take our health for granted . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice that there are some changes going on and we start to take them much more seriously . And as we look at our own moms and dads , we can see both the positive and the negative outcomes of how well or how badly they have taken care of themselves . As we grow a little bit older , the desire to be healthy , attractive , and potent does n't diminish , but it becomes harder to stay well and to look youthful . These are very powerful motivations . You would n't expect your car to function well if you did n't take care of it . You would n't expect your clothes to look good if you did n't take good care of them . You would n't expect your computer to work well if you did n't maintain it the way it needs to be maintained . More people now realize that , to be healthy , look healthy , feel healthy , and have wellness prevalent in their lives as they age , they need to take charge of their wellness and practice the kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , baby boomers are likely to continue setting new trends in the United States . In my new book , The Power Years , I argue that , instead of viewing life after 40 as a time of decline , retreat , and withdrawal , boomers are coming to see this as a terrific new opportunity to reevaluate their lives and consider their new options . They will be empowered by a great deal more experience and wisdom and will plot new courses . Instead of limitation , I believe they 'll choose liberation-it 's their nature . Boomers are collectively reshaping the middle years of life into a new period for renewal and reinvention . " Middlescence " - an older and wiser version of adolescence-is emerging . History provides us many role models for successful aging . Grandma Moses did n't start painting until she was almost 80 . Galileo published his masterpiece , Dialogue Concerning the Two New Sciences , at 74 . Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Guggenheim Museum in New York at 91 . Mahatma Gandhi was 72 when he completed successful negotiations with Britain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to a multiplying pool of role models for this new , empowered maturity . Warren Buffett remains the world 's most-respected investor at age 75 . Film stars Sophia Loren and Sean Connery are still considered sexy in their seventh and eighth decades . And Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan remains capable and wise at 78 . Many people will reap the benefits of new freedoms as they grow older . As children leave home , parents ' daily responsibilities are reduced . As busy schedules begin to let up , we 'll have more free time than at any previous period of our lives . With these chunks of newfound leisure , we 'll be free to pursue hidden passions and long-suppressed dreams : take a hike , write a novel , or sail the world . As the boomer generation passes into maturity , now is the time for companies to adjust their thinking about men and women over age 50 . When the leading edge of the baby boom first arrived , America and its institutions were totally unprepared . Waiting lists and long lines developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate , and in some hospitals , hallways were used as labor rooms . Similarly , apartments and homes did n't have enough bedrooms for boomer kids , there was a shortage of baby food and diapers , and department stores could n't keep enough toys in stock to meet the multiplying demand . When boomers took their first steps , the shoe , photo , and Band-Aid industries skyrocketed . Similarly , sales of tricycles , Slinkies , and Hula-Hoops exploded as the marketplace was flooded with products for kids . When baby boomers reach any stage of life , the issues that concern them-whether financial , interpersonal , or even hormonal-become the dominant social , political , and marketplace themes of the time . Boomers do n't just populate existing lifestages or consumer trends-they transform them . On January 1 , 1996 , the first baby boomer turned 50 . By the second decade of the twenty-first century , boomers will evolve into the largest elder generation in history . As the oldest members of the babyboom cohort start turning 65 in 2011 , they will swell the ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more than 70 million by 2030 . But boomers will transform the look , meaning , experience , and purpose of maturity . As they reach age 65 , it will not be viewed as " elderly . " Until recently , corporations , marketers , and entrepreneurs paid little attention to men and women over age 50 . There was , after all , little to spark their interest in a group whose members tended to be financially disadvantaged , frugal , and perceived as set in their ways and uninterested in new products and ideas . But Americans in their 50s and older currently earn more than $2 trillion in annual income , own more than 70% of the nation 's personal financial assets , and represent 50% of all discretionary spending power . In fact , their per capita discretionary spending is 2.5 times more than the average of younger households and is particularly strong in the financial services , health care , leisure , wellness , and beauty products categories . The Challenge to Social Security After studying aging issues for more than 30 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially secure old age is to be a part of a very small generation and then give birth to a very large generation . That way , when you are in your 70s and they are in their 40s and 50s , they 'll be paying enormous amounts of taxes for your support . That 's exactly the situation for today 's seniors . In contrast , the baby boomers are part of a very large generation , who , relatively speaking , gave birth to a smaller number of kids to support them . Whereas the boomers ' parents averaged four kids each , boomers themselves average around half that number . Because the boomers are also going to be living longer than anybody ever imagined , it 's going to become increasingly difficult for government entitlements to support retirement at the age and level that we 're seeing now . When Social security was first created in the United States , the average life expectancy was only 63 years , and there were 40 workers supporting each retiree . Now , there are only about 3.2 workers for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years from now-there will only be about two workers supporting me , and I just do n't think they 're going to want to do that . Many people are now choosing to continue working into their " retirement " years . We are on the verge of entering what I will call the " fourth era of retirement . " Four Eras of Retirement The first era of retirement lasted for about 100,000 years and ended in the early twentieth century . During that era , you worked all of your life . That was not considered a bad thing , because work served a variety of purposes . In addition to providing a livelihood , work also offered a way of feeling worthwhile and productive . It was a great socialization activity , where you encountered people of all ages . You felt involved . If you had a very demanding job and your body was no longer able to conduct the work required to do that job , you would be transitioned to a more appropriate function . So if grandpa 's job was to plow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with fixing the fences . But the idea that people were to retire was not a part of our consciousness . Working in maturity was viewed positively . During the Industrial Revolution , all that abruptly changed . By the 1920s , the second era of retirement began and was well established with the Grafting of Social security in the 1930s . This wonderful program had two purposes : First , it was designed to create a thin safety net for older adults in a period of economic frailty . second , with the unemployment levels skyrocketing to 25% , retirement provided an institutional process whereby older people would be removed from the workforce to make room for the young . Then the third era of retirement emerged during the 1960s and 1970s , when we began to think of retirement as the " golden years " of life . In fact , the younger you retired , the more successful you were perceived to be . At the same time , longevity began to rise for adults , and so the post-work period became a stage lasting not two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even longer . Ultimately , people began to think of retirement as a birthright-an entitlement . And that is the era in which we have been situated through the last quarter century . That era is fraying at the edges now , and I believe a fourth is now emerging . The New Retirement Era : From Retirement to " Rehirement " Recent research has shown that the modern retirement experiment is simply not working for most people . About half of all the retirees in the United States say they 'd rather be working , though most do n't want to work full time . Some might like to try doing something different and new , and most do n't want all the pressure they had when they were young . Some even want to work for free as volunteers . A lot of people are now saying , " You know , this golden age thing is just not enough for me . While a few years of leisure is great-decades of nothing to do can be deadly ! " So the new era of retirement will be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehirement is that a lot of retirees are just plain bored : Last year , the average retiree watched 43 hours of television a week . Another reason is that most people simply can not afford to live on a fixed income for 20 or more years . An increasing number of older adults are not interested in acting their age and retreating to the sidelines . Instead , they 'd rather rebel against ageist stereotypes and are seeking to be productive and involved and even late-blooming in their maturity . Again , we can look to a growing cadre of role models for the new style of aging . When you have John Glenn going up into space at 77 , Sumner Redstone running Viacom at 80 , and Lena Home still on the concert circuit at 85 , you are beginning to see the emergence of a new kind of lifestyle hero , an elder hero . These forces are fueling the new , fourth era of retirement . People now do not really want to retire at all . Rather , they want a " turning point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an exhausting career , take a break or sabbatical , and then reinvent themselves . Eventually , I believe , most people will want a better balance between work and leisure throughout their lives . As they mature , they would like to be able to work at what they want , perhaps working fewer hours with more recreation and leisure interspersed . They will want to stay in the game-not relegated to the sidelines . Retirement is in the midst of a sweeping transformation . In the years to come , more older men and women will be starting up their engines and jumping back into the workforce , maybe even having the most-productive years of their lives . Ageless Explorers vs . The Comfortably Content Generalizing about retirees is proving increasingly wrongheaded . Already we are seeing lifestyle or attitudinal differences among different retiree groups today . My firm , Age Wave , in collaboration with Harris Interactive and sponsored by AIG SunAmerica , recently interviewed 1,000 retiree households to find out how folks were doing and whether there were differences in their experience of retirement . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of mature adults , each with its own experience of retirement . We 've named one of the segments the Ageless Explorers-a group that makes up 27% of the older adult U.S. population . These are people who are becoming the new role models for retirement . They feel youthful and active . They want to contribute to their community . They like to learn and make new friends . They 're very much alive-all their pistons are firing , and they want to keep working . They view themselves as aging in an ageless way . When we asked these people when they thought they 'd feel elderly inside , they said " Never . " Another group of retirees we call the Comfortably Contents , comprising 19% of the older adult population . These people are essentially living their golden years-which may turn out to be yesterday 's retirement dream . Their primary desire in this stage of their lives is to simply relax and be free of worry , stress , and obligation . When we asked members of this segment when they thought they 'd feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well be a pleasant retirement for some , but for many people , this life of pure leisure is just not exciting or vibrant enough . My guess is that most boomers will become Ageless Explorers rather than Comfortably Contents . Photograph Payload specialist John Glenn ( right ) showed he still had " the right stuff " three decades after he first ventured into space . He is shown here with Commander Curtis Brown on the flight deck of the space shuttle Discovery . // The third segment , making up 22% of the older adult population , are the Live-for-Todays . These folks define themselves as fun and adventuresome . They 're interesting and lively people , and they love the idea of continuing to grow as individuals . The problem is that they spent so much of their lives living for today that they now do n't have enough money to feel comfortable . They have an enormous amount of worry and regret about how they 're going to make it , and they feel anxious that they may not achieve the level of pleasure and joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of financial preparedness . The fourth and largest category-32%-are the Sick-and-Tireds . These are people who have been beaten down by life , and most are having a miserable time in retirement . They 've got the least amount of money and have done the least to prepare for retirement . The effect of it is that their unfortunate state leaves them feeling hopeless and unwilling to do nearly anything with their lives . When we asked these people if they would like to go to the community college , they said " No . " Would they like to volunteer in their local church programs ? " No . " Would they like to spend more time with their family ? " No . " Take a trip ? " No . " They 've pretty much resigned themselves to the fact that their lives are winding down , and they are suffering their way to the end . Our " Re-Visioning Retirement " study also revealed that about 80% of the next generation of " retirees , " the boomers , expect to be working at least part time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as disconnected as many of today 's retirees seem to be . Instead , they want a different balance in their lives : They want to enjoy extended amounts of leisure time , but they also want to be doing some work-maybe two or three days a week of regular work , or helping out from time to time on a community project , or running a small business from home . Our respondents also said that they want to continue learning and growing in their maturity . They want to be developing their human potential rather than just sitting in the rocking chair and watching TV . The Transformation of Retirement We 're currently at the tipping point in which retirement is transforming into a new model . It is becoming a time for personal reinvention-new beginnings , lifelong learning , and a cyclic blend of work and leisure . In addition to their desire to postpone old age , the boomers ' propensity for personal growth and new lifestyle challenges will also render obsolete the traditional " linear life " paradigm , in which people migrate in lockstep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In its place , a new " cyclic life " paradigm is emerging in which education , work , and leisure are interspersed repeatedly throughout the life span . It will become normal for 50-year-olds to go back to school and for 70-year-olds to reinvent themselves through new careers . Phased retirements , part-time and flex-time work , and " rehirements " will become common options for elder boomers who 'll either need or want to continue working . Most discussions about increasing longevity have been focused on how to live longer rather than on why . I worry that without envisioning a new purpose for old age , we could be creating a future in which the young are pitted against the old . In youth , boomers were self-indulgent in their priorities . In their late teens and 20s , many shared an idealistic commitment to bettering society . During the past several decades of career building and childrearing , these boomers had to put aside many of their early ideals . In the decades ahead , the boomers will complete America 's transformation into a gerontocracy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . If they can step outside their generational tendency toward self-centeredness and wield this power wisely and productively , they could rise to their greatest height and make a remarkable success of history 's first multiethnic , multiracial , and multigenerational melting pot . But if they use their numbers and influence to bully younger generations and gobble up all of the available resources , political " age wars " could erupt in which the young lash out in anger and frustration at the weighty demands placed on their increasingly strained resources . However , if they can learn to exemplify a new kind of wise , mature leadership , when the boomers ' time on earth is over , perhaps they will be remembered as not just the largest generation in history , but also the finest .
