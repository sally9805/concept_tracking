Only This // They led the man to a spot at the middle of the field . A soccer field , grass , with mainly dirt around the center where the players spent most of the game . There was a special section for the handicapped on the far side , a section for women . The orphans were walking up and down the bleachers on my side selling candy and cigarettes . // A couple of older men carried whips . They wore grenade launchers on their backs . // The people are coming , a voice was saying into the loudspeaker , and the voice was right , the people were streaming in and taking their seats . Not with any great enthusiasm , as far as I could tell ; they were kind of shuffling in . I probably had more enthusiasm than anybody . I had a special seat ; they ? d put me in the grass at the edge of the field . In America , I would have been on the sidelines , at the fifty yard line with the coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you are our honored guest . // A white Toyota Hi-Lux drove onto the field and four men wearing green hoods climbed out of the back . There was a fifth man , a prisoner , no hood , sitting in the bed of the truck . The hooded men laid their man in the grass just off midfield , flat on his back , and crouched around him . It was hard to see . The man on his back was docile ; there was no struggle at all . The voice on the loudspeaker said he was a pickpocket . // " Nothing that is being done here is against God ? s law , " the voice said . // The green hoods appeared busy , and one of them stood up . He held the man ? s severed right hand in the air , displaying it for the crowd . He was holding it up by its middle finger , moving in a semicircle so everyone could see . The handicapped and the women . Then he pulled his hood back , revealing his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand into the grass and gave a little shrug . // I couldn ? t tell if the pickpocket had been given any sort of anesthesia . He wasn ? t screaming . His eyes were open very wide , and as the men with the hoods lifted him back into the bed of the Hi-Lux , he stared at the stump of his hand . I took notes the whole time . // I looked back at the crowd , and it was remarkably calm , unfeeling almost , which wasn ? t really surprising , after all they ? d been through . A small drama with the orphans was unfolding in the stands ; they were getting crazy and one of the guards was beating them with his whip . // " Get back , " he was saying , drawing the whip over his head . The orphans cowered. // I thought that was it , but as it turned out the amputation was just a warm-up . Another Toyota Hi-Lux , this one ma-roon , rumbled onto midfield carrying a group of long-haired men with guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had a blindfolded man with them . The Taliban were known for a lot of things and the Hi-Lux was one , jacked up and fast and menacing ; they had conquered most of the country with them . You saw a Hi-Lux and you could be sure that something bad was going to happen soon . // " The people are coming ! " the voice said again into the speaker , louder now and more excited . " The people are coming to see , with their own eyes , what sharia means . " // The men with guns led the blindfolded man from the truck and walked him to midfield and sat him down in the dirt . His head and body were wrapped in a dull gray blanket , all of a piece . Seated there in the dirt at midfield at the Kabul Sports Stadium , he didn ? t look much like a man at all , more like a sack of flour . In that outfit , it was difficult even to tell which way he was facing . His name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man who had pulled his hood back was standing at midfield , facing the crowd . The voice on the loudspeaker introduced him as Mulvi Abdur Rahman Muzami , a judge . He was pacing back and forth , his green surgical smock still intact . The crowd was quiet . // Atiqullah had been convicted of killing another man in an irrigation dispute , the Talibs said . An argument over water . He ? d beaten his victim to death with an ax , or so they said . He was eighteen . // " The Koran says the killer must be killed in order to create peace in society , " the loudspeaker said , echoing inside the stadium . " If punishment is not meted out , such crimes will become common . Anarchy and chaos will return . " // By this time a group had gathered behind me . It was the family of the murderer and the family of the victim . The two groups behind me were toing-and-froing as in a rugby game . One family spoke , leaning forward , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sharia law allows for the possibility of mercy : Atiqullah ? s execution could be halted if the family of the victim so willed it . // Judge Muzami hovered a few feet away , watching . // " Please spare my son , " Atiqullah ? s father , Abdul Modin , said . He was weeping . " Please spare my son . " // " I am not ready to do that , " the victim ? s father , Ahmad Noor , said , not weeping . " I am not ready to forgive him . He killed my son . He cut his throat . I do not forgive him . " // The families were wearing olive clothes that looked like old blankets and their faces were lined and dry . The women were weeping . Everyone looked the same . I forgot who was who. // " Even if you gave me all the gold in the world , " Noor said , " I would not accept it . " // Then he turned to a young man next to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mood tightened . I looked back and saw the Taliban guards whipping some children who had tried to sneak into the stadium . Atiqullah was still sitting on the field , possibly oblivious . The voice crackled over the loudspeaker . // " O ye who believe ! " the voice in the loudspeaker called . " Revenge is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered ; the freeman for the freeman , and the slave for the slave , and the female for the female . // " People are entitled to revenge . " // One of the green hoods handed a Kalashnikov to the murder victim ? s brother . The crowd fell silent . // Just then a jumbo jet appeared in the sky above , rumbling , forcing a pause in the ceremony . The brother stood holding his Kalashnikov . I looked up . I wondered how a jet airliner could happen by such a place , over a city such as this , wondered where it might be going . I considered for a second the momentary collision of the centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died and the brother crouched and took aim , leveling his Kalashnikov at Atiqullah ? s head . // " In revenge there is life , " the loudspeaker said . // The brother fired . Atiqullah lingered motionless for a second then collapsed in a heap under the gray blanket . I felt what I believed was a vibration from the stands . The brother stood over Atiqullah , aimed his AK-47 and fired again . The body lay still under the blanket . // " In revenge there is life , " the loudspeaker said . // The brother walked around Atiqullah , as if he were looking for signs of life . Seeing one , apparently , he crouched and fired again . // Spectators rushed onto the field just like the end of a college football game . The two men , killer and avenger , were carried away in separate Hi-Luxes , one maroon , one white . The brother stood up in the bed of the white truck as it rumbled away , surrounded by his fellows . He held his arms in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to people before they went home . Most everyone said they approved , but no one seemed to have any enthusiasm . // " In America , you have television and movies  --  the cinema , " one of the Afghans told me . " Here , there is only this . " // I left the stadium and walked in a line of people through the streets . I spotted something in the corner of my eye . It was a boy , a street boy , with bright green eyes . He was standing in an alley , watching me . The boy stood for a few more seconds , his eyes following mine . Then he turned and ran . // In the late afternoons the center of Kabul had an empty , twilight feel , a quiet that promised nothing more than another day like itself . There were hardly any cars then , just some women floating silently in their head-to-toe burqas. * Old meat hung in the stalls . Buildings listed in the ruins . // One of those afternoons , a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling and running his finger across his throat . // " Mother is no more , " he said , finger across the neck . " Father is finished . " // His name was Nasir and he repeated the phrase in German and French , smiling as he did . " Mutter ist nicht mehr . Vater ist fertig . " He dragged the finger across his throat again . Rockets , he said . Racketen . His pale green eyes were rimmed in black . He did not ask for money ; he wanted to clean my boots . Then he was gone , scampering down the muddy street with his tiny wooden box . // Kabul was full of orphans like Nasir , woebegone children who peddled little labors and fantastic tales of grief . You ? d see them in packs of fifty and sometimes even a hundred , skittering in mismatched shoes and muddy faces . They ? d thunder up to you like a herd of wild horses ; you could hear the padding of so many tiny feet . Sometimes I ? d wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d let their children run around like that , and then I ? d catch myself . The orphans would get out of control sometimes , especially when they saw a foreigner , grabbing and shoving one another , until they were scattered by one of the men with whips . They ? d come out of nowhere , the whip wielders , like they ? d been waiting offstage . The kids would squeal and scatter , then circle back again , grinning . If I raised a hand , they ? d flinch like strays. // If a war went on long enough the men always died , and someone had to take their place . Once I found seven boy soldiers fighting for the Northern Alliance on a hilltop in a place called Bangi . The Taliban positions were just in view , a minefield in between . The boys were wolflike , monosyllabic with no attention spans . Eyes always darting . Laughing the whole time . Dark fuzz instead of beards . They wore oddly matched apparel like high-top tennis shoes and hammer-and-sickle belts , embroidered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner one of the boys on the hill . His face was half wrapped in a checkered scarf that covered his mouth . Abdul Wahdood . All I could see were his eyes . I kept asking him how old he was and he kept looking over at his brother . His father had been killed a year before , he said , but they fed him here and with the money he could take care of his whole family , $30 a month . " My mother is not weeping , " Abdul said . I could see how bored he was , and his friends definitely noticed because one of them started firing his Kalashnikov over our heads . That really got them going , laughing hilariously and falling over each other . Two of them started wrestling . My photographer and I calmed them down and asked them to pose in a picture with us , and they lined up and grew very grave . After that they stood behind us in a semicircle and raised their guns , not like they were aiming at anything but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on the hilltop bearing a kettle of rice and the boys descended on it . The Taliban came down the road a few months later . I ? ve got the boys ? picture on a bookcase in my apartment . // I drove in from the east . I rode in a little taxi , on a road mostly erased , moving slowly across the craters as the Big Dipper rose over the tops of the mountains that encircled the capital on its high plateau . The cars in front of us were disappearing into the craters as we were climbing out of ours , disappearing then reappearing , swimming upward and then out , like ships riding the swells. // I passed the overturned tanks of the departed army , the red stars faded on the upside-down turrets . I passed checkpoints manned by men who searched for music . I stopped halfway and drank cherry juice from Iran and watched the river run through the walls of the Kabul gorge . There was very little electricity then , so I couldn ? t see much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the ruined architecture , nothing much but the twinkling stars . From the car , I could make out the lighter shade of the blasted buildings , lighter gray against the darkness of everything else , the scree and the wash of the boulders and bricks , a shattered window here and there . A single turbaned man on a bicycle . // One morning I was standing amid the blown-up storefronts and the broken buildings of Jadi Maiwand , the main shopping street before it became a battlefield , and I was trying to take it in when I suddenly had the sensation one sometimes feels in the tropics , believing that a rock is moving , only to discover it is a living thing perfectly camouflaged . They were crawling out to greet me : legless men , armless boys , women in tents . Children without teeth . Hair stringy and matted. // Help us , they said . // Help us . A woman appeared . I guessed it was a woman but I couldn ? t see her through her burqa . " Twelve years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating the phrase like some mantra , like it would get her a job . // For the first time I was talking to a woman I couldn ? t see . I could trace the words as they exited the vent , watch the fabric flutter as she breathed and spoke . But no face . No mouth . " Twelve years of schooling , " she said . She had a name , Shah Khukhu , fifty , a mother of five , missing a finger and a leg . She was hiking up her burqa to show me. // *A burqua is a head-to-toe garment worn by women . //
