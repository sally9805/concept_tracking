Just recently , subscriber K. J. J. from Seattle wrote to say : " You promise in the prelude of " A Little Learning " to bring the readership more stories of the nosphere , and I certainly hope that just was n't to get me to renew my subscription ! " Would we lie ? In a pig 's eye ! While we have several new stories by Mr. Hughes in inventory , none of them concern Guth Bandar , but fret not , nosphere fans ! Guth Bandar makes an appearance in Mr. Hughes 's third novel , Black Brillion , a copy of which arrived just as we were preparing this issue for press . <p> BY COVERING HIS EARS tightly with his palms , Guth Bandar was able to listen to the songs of the Loreleis in various Situations without becoming entranced . That was good , because to be captivated by the heart-tearing beauty of the voices would mean being trapped forever in one of the myriad byways of the collective unconscious - the Commons , as it was called by the fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become an adjunct scholar . Today he was collecting his seventh siren song , this one from a little visited Location where the singers were concealed behind a prototypical waterfall . The water sprang from a crevice in a cliff that soared above a darkly silent forest of ancient hardwoods . It fell as a sun-sparkled curtain into a limpid pool where a rainbow perpetually shimmered over the splash of foam . The song of the unseen Loreleis interwove seamlessly with the sound of the water . The combination of natural and magic sounds was a unique iteration of the siren motif and Bandar was determined to capture and reproduce the effect . He had entered the Location a short distance away , arriving through a node that delivered him to the foot of a spreading chestnut tree . Upon arrival he had immediately sung the appropriate sequence of tones that insulated him from the perceptions of any of the Location 's inhabitants . The most likely idiomatic entity inhabiting this corner of the Commons , apart from the Loreleis , would have been a tragic Hero drawn to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hapless Helper or a Faithful Beast . Bandar had searched the immediate forest but found none such . Their absence argued for his having arrived at a point in the Situation 's cycle where the song-ensorceled entities had already been drawn into the pool and romantically drowned . He ceased intoning the insulating thran and immediately the mingled sounds of cataract and female singers came drifting through the trees . At this distance the song was indistinct but its appeal was strong ; before he knew it , he had already taken an involuntary step toward its source and was even now taking a second . Bandar clapped hands over ears and the sound was shut out . His uplifted foot , about to complete the next step , paused in mid-stride . He stood still . Slowly , in the tiniest of increments , he eased the pressure of his palms against his ears . The faintest sound came to him and he experienced only a slight inclination to move toward it . He took a step , knowingly this time , then made sure to stop before further lightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfall was more clear-cut , the female voices woven through its splash and chuckle . Bandar took two steps sideways . Now a substantial beech stood between him and the deadly glade . He leaned his head against the cool , smooth bark and eased his palms away from his ears . The song insinuated itself , like a delicious itch , into his mind . Using an Institute technique , he fragmented his consciousness , letting part of him absorb the sound while another element of his awareness recited a sequence of syllables . The effect was to distance himself from the part of him that was aching to lift his forehead from the tree and race ecstatically toward the deadly pool . The song 's cycle was no more than three minutes long . Then the voices paused for a few heartbeats and began anew . Rigorously concentrating on the syllabic chant , Bandar let the recording function of his mind gather and hold the melody . He was careful not to compare it to the other six Lorelei songs he had already collected . It would not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed he had it . He broke off the syllabic sequence and again intoned the thran . Chanting , he turned and went farther into the forest . At a safe distance he called into existence the great globular map of the Commons that was the prize and glory of his memory . He consulted its intricate web of colored lines and points of intersection , then went a certain distance to his left . Now Bandar sang a new collection of notes , three short rising tones followed by a long descender . A ripple appeared in the air before him and resolved itself into a vertical slit . He stepped through and emerged onto a stony beach set between the waves of a wine dark sea and a grove of ancient olive trees . Nearby was a clearing overgrown with wild grapes and berries . He had scouted this Location a few days before and deduced that it was yet another version of the Desert Island . Remote and unpopulated earthly paradises were paradoxically popular in the Commons , bespeaking humankind 's perennial desire to get away from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet place to sit and think was one of the island 's attractions , the other was that it was but one node away from the eighth and final Lorelei Location , a rocky islet surrounded by crashing breakers . Again , drowning was the archetypical fate of those who fell beneath the singers " spell , but this one took its victims by the boatload . Bandar went up the beach and into the grove , chanting a thran to hide himself from any idiomats ; even a desert island might have an occupant , perhaps a visiting cannibal whose presence represented some archetypical fear of the Other . He poked about in the greenery but saw no traces of habitation , just a few goats and some pigs snuffling for fallen fruit beneath the olive trees . He went back down the beach and sat on a flat rock , dabbling his feet in the cool water . He ceased chanting the thran and took up the exercise of the syllables again so that he could replay the waterfall song in his mind . Even with the prevention technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost the necessary distance from the song 's insistent beauty . But a fear of sitting enraptured in this spot , endlessly hearing the song until he was absorbed into the Location , helped him to remain unaffected . He listened with critical attention and was pleased with what he heard . The seventh song in his collection was essentially the same as the other six , lending strong support to his thesis that the melody was itself an archetype : humanity 's Song of songs from which all other airs and rhapsodies sprang . If the eighth and final iteration of the Lorelei motif was the same as the other seven , Bandar would prepare a paper for presentation at the Institute 's annual Great Colloquium , to be held a few days hence . He would argue , he believed convincingly , for the Song being recognized as a new archetype , the first to have been identified in millennia . There would be opposition , of course , and it would be led by Underfellow Didrick Gabbris , Bandar 's lifelong academic rival . Gabbris would cite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that could ever have been discovered had by now been found , identified , discussed with full annotation , and for the most part forgotten . But not the Song of songs , Bandar knew . He had researched the matter thoroughly . He believed he was about to add something new and - he relished the pun - unheard of to the annals of the Institute . Gabbris would grind his teeth in helpless rage . Bandar took a moment to envision the event . He enjoyed the images so much that he let them appear on the screen of his consciousness a second time , with minor embellishments . A tiny sound interrupted his reverie , the click of stone against stone . Bandar rose from the rock on which he was seated and turned . A naked woman , lithe and small breasted , with raven hair and emerald eyes , had crept down the beach toward him . Her vulpine features were set in an expression of profound mischief and her hand held an olive wood staff . She was about to touch his shoulder with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tip . Bandar could not step out of her reach ; the flat rock pressed against the backs of his thighs . He opened his mouth to intone the four-and-two thran but before he could complete its opening tetrad the dark wood touched him . His first impression was that she was somehow increasing in size , looming over him so that he found himself looking up at her from about the level of her thighs . He felt a growing strain in his neck . He was having to bend it back so that he might continue gazing at her face . That was , he realized , because he had sunk onto all fours . At the same time he noticed that the odors of which he had been only moderately aware - the faint smell of the sea , the stink of dried seaweed up the beach , the mustiness under the olive trees , the spice of the Nymph 's flesh - had all grown both richer and sharper . To ease the strain in his neck he lowered his head and regarded his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn together into two clumps , the nails expanding and darkening . Hooves , he thought , and a pig 's hooves at that . He heard a giggle from above him , the sound of a malicious girl relishing a prank . Then he felt a sharp pain in his buttocks . She had whacked him across the hams with her staff . He started forward , up toward the olive trees , and was encouraged to hurry when a second blow landed in the same region as the first . " Hurry , pig , " said a voice both melodious and cruel . " Funny , tasty Pig . " A third swat followed . Bandar squealed and scuttled for the trees . THE NOSPHERE , as the collective unconscious was more properly called by the Institute 's scholars , lay hidden in the lower reaches of every human psyche . It was a labyrinth of interconnected Landscapes , Events , and Situations , the cores of every myth , legend , fiction , and joke . Its inhabitants were the archetypical figures that furnished the dreams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maiden , Mother and Crone , Temptress and Comforter , and a host of others . An archetype commonly encountered was the Enchantress , realized in a multitude of motifs : the maleficent Wood Witch who magicked errant hunters into wolf-slaves ; the Faery Princess who beguiled a lovestruck swain through an afternoon that became a decade ; the teasing Coquette whose charms figuratively turned men into animals ; and the island-bound Nymph whose spells went the whole hog . A nonaut like Guth Bandar ought to have been sequestered from her powers by a thran , a specific series of notes - like the protective song of the Singer who visited Hell in the dawn time myth - that removed him from this Enchantress 's purview . But thrans had to be sung continuously , not set aside while the nonaut relished an imagined triumph over a rival . Now , as the Nymph drove him toward the rest of her herd of swine , Bandar endeavored to chant the four-and-two . His corporeal body , seated in his meditation chamber at the Institute , waiting for his consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transposed to his consciousness whenever it went sojourning through the Commons . When that consciousness was transformed into a pig , however , Bandar found that a porcine vocal apparatus could not strike the proper notes . His overlarge ears , flopping against his fatted cheeks , told him that he was producing unmusical skreeks and skrawks . These had no effect on his captor other than to provoke yet another blow from the staff and an admonition to " Keep silence , piggy , else I 'll not wait for your fattening . I 'll smoke your belly and boil your head tomorrow . " He was driven into the olive grove . To his new nose , the place was awash with the smells of mulch and overripe fruit crushed underfoot , overlaid by the rank reek of the goats and the now curiously appealing scent of the other swine . The Nymph drove him into their midst and they made way for him with squeals and grunts , regarding him with sad and knowing gazes . Their attention was soon diverted , however , when their owner struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing a heavy rain of olives . The swine fell upon the fruit with snuffles of appetite . One heavily larded specimen ignored the feed . A piebald boar , he showed not appetite but stark terror as the Nymph favored him with a weighing look . She poked a finger into the fat overlying his ribs and gave a grunt that bespoke a decision reached . She goaded the hog with the foot of her staff and chased him toward a trail that led from the grove deeper into the island 's center . The chosen one gave a shrill cry that , even though a pig 's throat formed it , carried an unmistakably human note of fearful despair . Bandar fought against panic . He also had to exert himself to overcome a growing interest in the ripe olives that littered the grove . He felt an urge to shoulder aside the other swine to get at the choicest morsels . These inclinations only deepened his fear . A consciousness that stayed too long in any Commons Location was at risk of being absorbed . Even the insulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpowering the sojourner and fitting him into the matrix of an Event or Situation . The discovery and mapping of the nosphere over the course of millennia had seen countless explorers inextricably engrossed into Locations . Their consciousnesses had devolved into the semi-awareness of idiomatic entities , or died outright when their virtual flesh had been transfixed by a phalanx 's spears or immolated by a dragon 's breath . Being transformed into a swine worked against Guth Bandar . It threatened to weaken the integrity of his sojourning self . He must leave this Location soon or risk losing his sense of identity . If he forgot who he was he would truly become a transmogrified pig , fattening on olives , until his turn came to encounter the knife and the rendering tub . He tore his attention away from the delicious olives he had been munching while he contemplated his fate . He found he was even more drawn toward a young sow who was giving off an odor that grew more maddeningly compelling the closer she came . A big boar with well developed tusks was shadowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be and felt a growing urge to paw the ground and voice a guttural challenge . Concentrate , he told himself . And get clear of that sow while you 're still more man than pig . He made a great effort and turned his head away from her delightful scent , then deliberately followed his nose toward less freighted air . He found the path down which the Nymph had herded her victim and followed it . No pig would willingly take this course , he told himself , and felt better for it . The path led him uphill through woods for a short while , then leveled off in a long , broad meadow of short grass grazed by sheep . Bandar wondered if all the four-legged inhabitants of the island had been transformed from human idiomats and if the kind of animals they became were determined by the Enchantress 's whims or by their own natures . He could n't account for anything in his own makeup that would qualify him for pigdom , unless it was his penchant for rooting about in academic puzzles and turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were decidedly unpiglike musings , a thought that encouraged him further . He was finding that four limbs and strong hooves made for rapid locomotion . He was almost across the meadow now , following a path of beaten earth . Ahead was a stand of stately trees . Between the boles and branches he could make out an imposing building faced in marble , ornamented with columns antl pilasters and set about with statuary . As he neared the trees he veered off the path and approached by a roundabout route . He came upon a garden with a pool and fountain , beyond which a paved walkway sloped down to a grotto . He followed it , his hooves clicking softly on the stones . It led him to a sunken lawn , shaded by a rocky outcrop beneath which a bower of fragrant grasses had been heaped up and covered with carpets of soft wool . On this reclined a stocky man of middle years , red of hair and beard , who idly contemplated the gold beaker in his hand before he raised it to his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mouth to lose itself in his beard , but he paid it no heed , his bright blue eyes gazing at nothing . A beguiled Hero , Guth Bandar thought . He regarded the idiomat closely , saw neither great thews nor features so striking as to indicate divine parentage , although there were scars on the man 's arms and naked chest . A very old type , he concluded , a swordster when necessary , yet more inclined to the craftiness of a trickster . Bandar was pressing his mind to remember what he 'd learned of this variant of the Hero archetype . There might be some way to play upon its known characteristics to create a strategy that would lead to his being reconstituted as a human being . After which , he would forthwith intone a thran to shield him from the view of Hero and Nymph long enough to put some distance between him and them . A quick chant of a particular seven-tone sequence would open an emergency gate . He would leap through and return to his inert body in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the Nymph came for him with the knife - he might try to conjure the gate while still in pig form . The risk would be that he might arrive back in his body to find that parts of his psyche were still more swine than human . There were already too many people like that on Old Earth - Didrick Gabbris merely the first that came to mind . A voice broke into his thoughts and he realized that the figure on the bower was speaking to him . " I said , " What are you looking at , pig ? ' " Now the idiomat shrugged and drank more wine . " Though even a pig might look at a king . " Bandar contrived as intelligent a face as his porcine features would allow . " Hmmm ? " he said , and though the arrangement of his huge nasal cavity gave the wordless sound a certain honk , he thought it sounded reasonably human for a pig . " I have pigs of my own , " the Hero said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the same sound , but altered the tone so that it sounded like , " Really ? " " Yes , " said the idiomat , " but you know I 'd be happy just to be a swineherd if I could see once more my wife and son . " " Hmmm , " said Bandar , with a nod and a note of sympathy . " I really must do something about getting home , " the Hero said . " Build another ship or something . " This time Bandar 's " Hmmm , " offered encouragement , a spur to action . There ensued a conversation , largely one-sided , in which the Hero King issued observations and Bandar replied with combinations of nods , wags , and hums . The nonaut was surprised how much information could be exchanged even when one interlocutor 's vocabulary could not rise above the barest minimum . " You are decidedly insightful for a pig , " said the Hero . " Indeed , I have known princes who could learn from you . " He drank the lees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood on a nearby table . " If they were n't too busy sulking in their tents or stealing concubines . " The idiomat poured more wine and hefted the goblet , then paused with it halfway to his stained lips . " I like a good palaver , " he said . " It seems to me I have not had a conversation of any depth since ... " He appeared to be consulting a mental timeline that would not hold its shape . " Since a long time , " he finished . " Hmmm , " said Bandar . Engaging in conversation , even under his present disadvantages , was helping to keep pigness at a distance . He was wondering how he could turn this encounter further to his profit . Perhaps the Hero could persuade the Nymph to undo the spell . Focusing on the matter with a pig 's brain was not easy , however . He missed the Hero 's next question . Fortunately the idiomat seemed to be accustomed to repeating himself . " I said , " It seems to me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen any of them , have you ? " An agonized squeal from not far off claimed their attention . Moments later , the Nymph came tripping down the walkway , carrying a gold plate on which lay two fair-sized morsels of raw flesh . She went to where a brazier stood on a tripod and poked at its coals with a knife , blowing them into a glowing heat . Bandar backed into the undergrowth while she was laying the plate on the embers . His sharp ears heard a faint sizzle while his pig 's nose caught a whiff of cooking meat . It smelled delicious . " I 've brought you a little treat , my dear , " the Nymph said , over her shoulder . " Something to restore your vigor . " Bandar realized what the two frying objects were and where they had come from . Not far away must be a most despondent boar . He also had no doubt as to the fate of the king 's erstwhile shipmates . He could not repress a gasp and a shudder . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nymph 's attention . She turned to regard him . The brows knitted above her sharp nose and the green eyes flashed , then narrowed . Bandar was reminded that idiomats , even the Principals of Locations , tended toward simplicity . They were not real people , only rudimentary personas - much like the characters in myth and fiction to which they had given rise . Where people would pause and consider , idiomats invariably acted . " Have you met this remarkable pig ? " the king was saying , even as his consort crossed the lawn , knife in hand and unmistakable motivation in her face . Bandar turned and fled . He had been a healthy young man in his virtual self , therefore he was a healthy young pig . He soon discovered how to go from a rapid trot to a fast gallop , although he was n't entirely sure that pigs were built for the latter gait . He did not stop to ponder the question , however ; he made his best speed with the sound of thudding Nymph footsteps closing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ran up a slope , breaking through a shrubbery of artfully trimmed bushes , then onto another open meadow - this one with donkeys . They scattered as he burst through their midst , heading for a thick growth of trees that climbed toward what looked to be either a high hill or a low mountain at the island 's center . His pursuer 's footsteps grew louder . He put on more speed but soon he heard her drawing near again . And now it became apparent that pig lungs and legs were designed more for the sprint than the marathon , whereas Nymphs were apparently tireless . He could hear not only her footfalls but her breathing as he reached the trees and raced between the boles . Not far in he found thickets of thorn and bramble and into these he plunged without slowing . The sharp protrusions tore at his hide , but pig skin was thick and the scratches caused him far less discomfort than he would have experienced as a man . His long , low , and relatively streamlined shape was also ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the Nymph behind . He could hear her cursing him , her voice receding as he went deeper into the woods . Fortunately , it seemed that her maledictions were not effective unless she was wielding the olive staff . Bandar ran a little farther into the greenery , then stopped in a small open space roofed over with prickly vines . He elevated his ear flaps and moved his head from side to side , but heard nothing to alarm him . He let his wide nostrils sample the air and scented no immediate danger . He bent his forelimbs , then let his hindquarters settle to the forest floor . He had to think . There was no point in seeking to enlist the Hero King 's aid . The red-haired idiomat was the Enchantress 's prize - her control of him was almost certainly what this Situation was all about . She would guard him closely . Nor could Bandar hide out on the island and attempt to reshape his virtual flesh . For one thing , the technique required leisure to concentrate ; he doubted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only time he had attempted the procedure he had distorted himself in freakish ways . Getting from swinehood to humanness was almost certainly beyond him . Bandar 's best recourse was to find a gate and pass through to somewhere less lethal . Then he might plot a course through to some Location where the Principal was a wielder of benign magic who would lift the Nymph 's curse and restore the nonaut to his true proportions . There were relatively few such places and personas - the Commons dealt out more horror than happy fun times - but they were there to be found . And Guth Bandar had the means to find them . He concentrated and summoned the map of the nosphere into virtual existence . He found it difficult to see deeply into the complex webwork of points and lines - his pig 's eyes were not so placed as to enable stereoscopic vision of near objects . Finally , he cocked his head to bring one eye to bear and began to plot a route to salvation . He found that there were two nodes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One was a single-direction gate that would take him into a nightmarish cityscape , an urban dystopia rife with crime and infamy where the only semblance of order was a brotherhood of bounty hunters . It was no place for an innocent pig ; those who might not see him as food on the hoof would likely use him for target practice . The other gate was a multi-destination node : depending on the sequence of tones employed by an approaching nonaut , it might open to any of five places . One was a mellow kingdom of strolling troubadours and itinerant tale-spinners . Better yet , a short jog across that Location would bring him to a gate into a children 's Situation - luckily , not one of the many nasty ones , but a winter fantasia whose magical , merry Principal enjoyed bestowing gifts and bonbons on good little boys and girls . He would surely grant the wish of a good little pig . The multifarious node waited in the meadow of the donkeys . That was a dangerously wide space to cross , especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one trial to find the right notes to activate the exit . But he resolved to hazard the meadow , though he would wait for nightfall . In the meantime , he would practice producing tones from a pig 's throat . THE MOON RODE full and high across a dark blue heaven , flooding the field with silvery light . Bandar stood beneath the last of the trees and surveyed the open space . Pig night vision was no better than the human version , but his ears and nose added a wealth of sensory impressions . The meadow 's inhabitants stood clumped not far away , making donkey murmurs to each other . Of the Nymph there was no sign . Bandar crept out onto the cropped grass , advanced a few steps and paused . He heard nothing . He felt the slight tingle in the back of his mind that told him he was near to a node and went in the direction that made the sensation increase . A few more steps and again he paused , again hearing and seeing nothing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mentally rehearsing the sequence of tones he must sing to activate it . Midway across the meadow , he heard a rustle of motion among the donkeys . He turned to look their way . A slim figure rose from amongst them . It was the Nymph and in her hand was the olive wood staff . Swiftly she laid its leering tip to the backs of the donkeys . With each contact the touched beast changed shape , became longer and lower . Their excited braying became a baying , the deep bell of a hunting pack underlaid by slavering growls . She touched the last of the herd then pointed with the staff . " After him ! " she cried . " Rend him ! " Bandar had not waited for the transformations to be completed . He burst toward the place where the right combination of sounds would call up safety from empty air . But the pack moved faster than even a wellmotivated pig . They swept across the meadow toward him . He could feel the nearness of the node and he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing happened . He realized that running and chanting at the same time , especially with his less-than-expert control of porcine vocal equipment , were affecting his pitch and intonation . He skidded to a halt before the spot where a ripple should be wavering in the moonlight . The air was undisturbed . The pack came on . He could see them , long ears and dark muzzles , black lips drawn back from foam-flecked fangs . The collective sound they made , of appetite and blood lust , sent a shiver through Bandar 's meat . He took a short settling breath and sang the tones again . The beasts were almost on him . The lead hound gathered its hindquarters beneath it and sprang , stretching its lean body through an arc that would bring its jaws to Bandar 's soft throat . The ripple appeared . Bandar jumped . He heard the click of canine teeth closing on empty air . Then he was through . The Commons was the original fount of all myth and legend . Explored over tens of thousands of years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cataloged . Yet among undergraduates of the Institute , the nosphere had paradoxically become the subject of a myth of its own . Though senior fellows and tenured scholars derided the notion , students whispered to each other that they sometimes felt that humanity 's collective unconscious was somehow awaie of their presence - and worse , that their traipsing through Events and Situations was resented . How else to explain the ill luck that too frequently accompanied sojourns among the idiomatic entities ? It was understandable that the early explorers , groping their way from one uncharted Location to another , might fall afoul of an anthropophagie giant or a murderous worm . But with the Commons now as well mapped as any place in the waking world of Old Earth , why should nonauts so often blunder into lethal traps and snares ? Why must the nosphere be so unforgiving ? As a youth , Bandar had shivered at the speculations of his classmates . In his maturity , his views were aligned with the establishment 's . Only the day before this exploration , overhearing a callow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sentient Commons , Bandar had spoken sharply . " The Commons is an aggregate of contending forces . Disunity is its most salient characteristic . Fool contends against Wise Man , Hero confronts Villain , Anima opposes Animus . How can these contentious fragments unite behind a single program ? " Chundlemars had had the temerity to dispute the issue . " Yet a mob , however disparate its members " views on a host of issues , can cooperate to attack an inimical outsider . " Bandar bridled . " The key word in " collective unconscious " is " unconscious , " not " collective , ' " he said . " To become aware of intruders , the unconscious must first become self-aware . Self-awareness is by definition consciousness . Therefore it is a logical impossibility for the unconscious to become conscious . " The student had bent before Bandar 's tirade but had still shown fight . " Perhaps not impossible , but merely difficult , " he had said , " hence its efforts to capture our attention are diffuse and seem inconclusive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brusque gesture had sent the youths hustling off to another corner of the Institute 's grounds . But now as Bandar gazed at the view that had appeared before him the moment he had come through the gate and onto this grassy hill , a frisson of fear caused the skin of his back to twitch . If this Location was the sunny realm of bards and troubadours that he had sought , he ought to be able to see at least one towered and turreted castle , its conical roofs aflutter with gay pennants and gonfalons . There ought to be a fountain or two on verdant lawns and gentle woods with trees as round and symmetrical as a child 's drawing . Instead the noonaut saw a tangled forest broken only by a narrow , unpaved track that wound its way past scattered clearings in which rude dwellings stood next to vegetable gardens . Farther off stood a sturdier edifice of red brick with a slate roof and a chimney from which gray smoke idled . But nowhere to be seen were shaded bowers or romantic ruins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cawing of two ragged birds . His pig 's nose brought him not the scent of flowers and fruited trees but a faint odor of carrion . Not good , he thought . He brought the map into existence again . He examined the symbolic representation of the node through which he had arrived and saw that it was even more multifarious than he had realized . The gate was identified by a yellow heptagon within a green circle , signifying that it led to seven destinations if sung to in one key , and yet another seven outcomes if the thran was dropped a full tone . Yet Bandar had been sure the map had shown him a green pentagon in a yellow circle . He had carefully traced the outcomes . He should be in the land of song and story , on his way to the children 's winter paradise . Instead , as he studied the map , he was not quite sure where he had landed . He tried to focus on the symbols identifying this present Location , but the characters " lines kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist . His impression , however , was that he was in one of the most obscure sites , a subsidiary of a tributary two steps removed from a minor whorl . That meant that there might be few gates out of this Location , perhaps even only one , and he would have no choice but to take it . How had he misread the map ? Accidents were always possible , but Bandar had planned his route with meticulous care . The adolescent fear of being surrounded by a malicious , resentful Commons crept out of the closet . Bandar resolutely thrust it back and mentally slammed the door . Perhaps his pig eyes did not resolve certain colors or shapes as well as his human orbs could . He would be more careful next time . He raised the flaps of his ears and turned in a slow circle on the hilltop . Beyond the squawking of the birds he heard the sound of voices raised in argument . They were coming from a clearing some small way off . The voices offered Bandar a means of discovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and identify the idiomats , deducing from their characteristics the Situation or Event in which he had landed . Then he would find its precise position on the map and from there plot a route to safety . The forest , when he entered it , was of the Sincere/Approximate classification : what the Institute called " forest-like " rather than a truly realistic mix of trees , underbrush , and detritus . Its iconic characteristics told Bandar that he was almost certainly in a Class Four Situation : likely an archetypical joke or one of the lighter tales for children , possibly one so ancient that it had been superseded eons ago by new formulations . But nothing was ever lost in the Commons . Just as Bandar 's essential gene plasm carried all the instructions necessary to build precursor species that had gone extinct a billion years before , so the collective unconscious preserved every Form and Type that the human brain had ever conceived . Still , there were advantages to being stranded in a Class Four Situation : physical surroundings wmild count for little ; the Situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants . That would pose no difficulties if the situation revolved around , say , a sexual encounter between a lusty farmer 's wife and a hired hand . The idiomats would be so intent upon each other that a pig would pass unnoticed . But if he was traversing a tale about a bridge-haunting troll that devoured talking livestock , Bandar might suddenly find himself added to the menu . He therefore made a light-hooved approach to the sound of voices . He was hearing an argument ; that much was clear from the tone even before he could make out the words . That it was a good-natured dispute , carried on without rancor , was a good sign : the disputants were unlikely to have weapons in their hands . Bandar stole closer , weaving stealthily through the generic underbrush . The arguers called each other " Brother , " and seemed to be contradicting each other over the merits of construction methodologies - a pair of artisan monks was Bandar 's first thought . He eased his way through some cartoonishly rendered bushes , finding that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The voices were quite clear now , the argument definitely about the strength of a wall . Apparently winds were a factor here , since one of the disputants was contending that the wall before them would collapse at the first breath . The other replied that its interwoven construction gave the barrier a resilient tensile strength , adding , " The willow bends where the oak falls . " Bandar moved closer . There were fewer leaves between him and the argument now . He could make out something blue . He pressed a little farther forward and saw that it was coarse cloth with yellow stitching , the leg of a utilitarian garment such as a workman or farmer might wear . He inched toward the leg and saw that it ended in a scuffed leather boot . Not so bad , he thought . He was in some Wisdom Story , perhaps a minor variant of the Flexibility versus Rigidity dichotomy . Its idiomats would be exclusively focused on their debate and soon would come a great wind to test one theory over another . Bandar was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have traversed what must surely be a very small Location , found an exit gate , and be on his way . He backed away from the arguing idiomats . But as he did so he found that his pig 's ears were better designed for pressing forward through underbrush , even of the generic sort , than for rearward motion . One of his flaps caught on a twig , which scraped over the protruding cartilage before snapping free . Above Bandar 's head one branch slapped against another and the bush trembled , swishing its broad and simple leaves against each other . " What was that ? " said the champion of flexible walls . " It came from down there , " said the advocate for solid masonry . The first voice dropped to a whisper . " Is it You Know Who ? " The branches above Bandar 's head were swept away by a stout walking stick and he heard the second voice take on a tone of horror and disgust as it said , " No , it 's some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideous ! " cried the other . Now all Bandar wanted was to back out of the bush , turn , and run . But he could not help looking up toward the voices . He saw above him , their features contorted in horror , the faces of two anthropomorphically rendered pigs . " Kill it ! " said Flexibility with an idiomat 's typical decisiveness , and Rigidity raised his heavy cane to put his brother 's advice into action . Bandar squealed and tore himself loose from the bushes , but now the two pig-men were crashing through the undergrowth after him and showing that in addition to their murderous impulses their humanly formed legs and feet could sustain a considerable speed . Bandar deked and jinked , circling tree trunks and leaping over fallen logs . The brothers pounded after him and soon displayed a dismaying intelligence : they spread out , one seeking to cut Bandar off and drive him toward the other . Both , he saw , were armed with heavy sticks . The nonaut dodged a blow that could have snapped his spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the bushes into the sunlit clearing . A structure was in his way , its walls an interlacing of withes and flexible canes bound by fibrous cords , its roof a dense mat of woven reeds . Bandar raced around a corner and galloped across the open space , hearing the thudding bootsteps of his pursuers and the rasp of their breathing . They were gaining . His short pig 's legs were trembling and his pig 's lungs burned . He looked toward the trees on the other side of the clearing , hoping for a thicker bush , perhaps a bramble , through which he could insinuate himself while his pursuers were deterred . But he saw nothing that would suit and the stick-wielding pig-men were almost on him . Then from the woods ahead burst a third pig-man , attired like the others , but with an expression of sheer terror disfiguring its already distorted features . This one paid no attention to Bandar but called to the two others , " He 's right behind me ! He destroyed my house with a single blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the woods . Bandar 's pursuers immediately abandoned the chase and ran in the same direction , cries of panic fading in their wake . Bandar had skidded to a halt , his legs limp as boiled celery , his breath coming in pants . He heard the clatter of the pig-men diminishing as they fled through the woods behind him on the far side of the clearing . Then he heard a new sound , an engine-like chuffing growing louder . It came from beyond the nearer trees . He remembered the discussion of wind and the fleeing pig-man 's mention of a house destroyed by a single blast . An archetypical Storm elemental , he thought , an elemental with a yen to destroy weakly constructed buildings - therefore no danger to a bystander pig . He stood to catch his breath as the huffing and puffing grew louder . From the darkness under the trees , not far from where Bandar stood , a shape emerged . It was a running figure , knees high and elbows pumping , dressed in black overalls over a red shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was the face that caught Bandar 's attention - the long muzzle flecked with foam , the red lolling tongue , the cruel , needle-sharp fangs . Oh , my , he thought , not just Storm , but Appetite too . An Eater . The great golden eyes turned Bandar 's way and the idiomat scarcely broke its stride before swerving toward him . Worse yet , was Bandar 's thought , Indiscriminate Appetite , an Eat-em-all-up . He flung himself back the way he had come , but the slavering pursuer was even faster than the pig-men had been , and here in the clearing there were no obstacles to interpose between the Eater and the virtual Bandar flesh it craved . He was headed for the stick house , specifically for a wall against which stood a pile of unused building materials . He leapt to the top of the heap , sticks flying from beneath his scrabbling hooves , one of them happily striking the Eater 's bulbous nose and causing the pursuer to pull up sharply , though only for the time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pause gave Bandar time to scramble atop the woven roof , cross the peak , and slide down the other side . He heard the beast coming over the roof after him . The trees were too far away ; the Appetite would run him down . Beside Bandar , the door to the house of sticks stood open . He ducked inside and closed the portal after him , glad to see that it was made of thick timbers , closely fitted , and that it had a hinged bar that he could nose into nlace . Scarcely had the barrier been sealed than the Eater struck it with force enough to make the door rattle in its mounts . A second blow followed but the timbers held firm . Now it grew quiet . Bandar put an eye to a tiny gap in the woven wall and saw that the Eater had drawn some distance away . It sat on its haunches and studied the nonaut 's refuge for a few moments , then exhibited the demeanor of one who has thought through a problem and come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air . Bandar saw its thorax expand and contract to unlikely dimensions , and now he knew what must come . Somehow , this idiomat combined the essentials of the Eater and a Storm elemental . He wondered for a moment what demented mythmaker had first welded the two together , then deferred speculation while he sought a way out of the refuge that had become a deadly trap . The floor was packed dirt . Pigs " hooves ought to make good digging implements . He went to the wall opposite where the Storm-Eater worked to inflate itself and frantically scratched at the earth . Fortunately , this was a Class Four Situation so the dirt was made of uniformly homogeneous particles , without rocks or boulders to block his passage . The soil flew , piling up behind Bandar 's haunches as the hole deepened into a passage under the wall . Above the sound of his own labors he could hear the idiomat chanting , " Let me come in , " in a sing-song voice that carried the force of a gusty breeze . There came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the house shook and the door rattled as a blast of air struck the opposite wall . Bandar heard a snapping of sticks and a tearing of cords . He looked back between his legs and saw that the door and the posts that supported it were canted inward . The whole front wall was skewed out of true . He heard another puffing and huffing . The Eater was refilling its body with a fresh storm . A second blast would surely blow the house in . Bandar dug faster , harder , deeper . Soon there was a pig-sized passage beneath the back wall . He wriggled into the hole , scraped more earth out of his way , the narrow hooves doing a gratifyingly fast and thorough job . In a moment , he saw a chink of daylight above him . In another moment , the chink had become a swatch , then a fully realized hole . Bandar wriggled through just as the storm smashed the front wall to flinders . The strong door crashed to the floor , the outer walls blew out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandar squirmed was pulled inward . But he was out in sunlight and across the clearing , keeping the wreckage of the house between him and the Eater . He could hear it thrashing through the debris , alternately cooing to him and smacking wet lips . Bandar ducked into the undergrowth and lay trembling beneath a bush . The Eater kicked at the wreckage of the house , searching for him . Then Bandar saw it notice the tunnel he had dug beneath the back wall . The beast squatted and examined the gouge in the earth , sniffed at it with its elongated snout . Then it raised its head and peered about the clearing . Bandar resisted an instinctive urge to draw farther back into the bushes ; should his movements shake his branches , the Eater would be on him in seconds . Its gaze passed over Bandar without seeing him . After a long moment , its head turned in the direction the anthropomorphic pigs had taken and it rose and set off after them . Bandar waited until it was out of sight , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale he now thought it was , none of the idiomats would return to this part of the Location until the Situation had completed its cycle and begun anew . He brought up the great globe of the Commons and examined it as best he could with one eye , then the other . It was easier to see in the clearing 's bright sunlight than deep in the Nymph 's forest . He found the gate through which he had come from the enchantress 's island - it was still a yellow heptagon within a green circle - and saw where he must be : a small mauve spot in the shape of a diamond , with a white stripe running diagonally from one side to another . Squinting his pig 's eye , he deduced that the exit gate was not far off , somewhere beyond the brick house , where no doubt the Eater was now laying siege to the three brothers . Bandar collapsed the map and thought about the Situation . This was clearly an admonitory tale for children , not as he had thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Three Wayfarers motif that constantly reappeared in endless variations throughout the collective unconscious . It would conclude with one or , more likely , all three of the pig-men turning the tables on the Eater . From the effects of the monster 's wind on the house of sticks . Bandar could guess that the Eater would fail to blow in the brick house . Then , its elemental power literally blown out , it would somehow be captured and destroyed by the brothers . Bandar 's best course was to position himself where he could observe the Situation 's end game . Then during the Pause that always preceded a renewal of the cycle , he could pass through the egress node and move to the next Location : a Landscape of primeval prairie . He might have to dodge vast herds of ruminants and those who hunted them , but more likely he would be alone on a rolling plain of endless grass . The prairie connected to another Location - a mountain valley where no one ever grew old . From there , Bandar could loop back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He trotted down the forest trail and soon came to the clearing where the little brick house stood . He approached warily , staying within the cover of the undergrowth . He did not see the Eater , but he saw that a painted wooden sign that bore the legend " A. Pig " in cursive script had been blown off the door 's lintel to land on a strip of bare earth from which the stalks of petalless flowers grew . The Eater has blown himself out and is probably even now being dispatched by the pig-men , Bandar thought . He crept to one of the shuttered windows and peered between the slats . Within , he saw the trio gathered about an open fireplace in which a deep black cauldron steamed . The bricklayer held the pot 's lid in readiness and all three were regarding the chimney with evident expectation . Of course , Bandar thought , the frustrated Eater descends the chimney , is clapped into the pot to become the pig-men 's dinner . The Eater would be eaten by those he would eat : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commons . He watched to see the final act of the tale . But moments later , he saw a portion of the floor behind the three pig-men suddenly subside . A dark clawed paw emerge . The brothers did not notice . Another paw emerged , then the head of the Eater , then his torso followed . The monster made lipsmacking noises and now , too late , the pig-men turned and saw the horror emerging from their floor , which was of the same friable earth as at the house of sticks . . The Eater was between the pig-men and the door . The single room was small . The victims displayed fright and panic , the beast a terrible single-mindedness . The ensuing scenes were not pleasant to watch . Bandar tore his gaze away and ran as fast as his tired pig 's legs would take him in the direction of the exit gate . He did not fear pursuit by the Eater ; the beast would be occupied in feasting for some time . But Bandar was sure the outcome he had just seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing the monster another way into the pig-man 's house , he had interfered with the Situation , perverting the idiomats from their prescribed course . Among nonauts , the term for such adulterated behavior was disharmony . To cause a single idiomat to behave in a disharmonious manner could cause ripples . To distort an entire Situation , even a minor one , from its proper conclusion was to ignite the fuse for an explosive manifestation of psychic energy . Bandar had no idea what was about to happen within this Location , but he was certain it would not be good for the errant pig who had triggered it . And he had no wish to experience it . His nonaut 's sense told him that the egress node was a short trot along the forest trail , then across a meadow . He followed the tingling in his awareness and soon was running through generic grass . He pulled up short where the gate should be and chanted the appropriate opening thran . Nothing happened . Again his enhanced hearing told him that his pig 's larynx and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sound from behind him made Bandar turn and look . A spiraling vortex had appeared in the air above the brick house . It grew darker as he watched , a miniature whirlwind descending toward the roof . When it touched , dark slates were wrenched loose and sent spinning . A cracking , grinding noise grew in volume as the vortex broke up the timbers of the roof . Beams flew , rafters shot out in all directions like missiles . Now the tornado bored deeper into the structure and Bandar turned back to the gate . He chanted the thran again , but knew the notes were off key . Behind him came a rumbling , clattering noise . It sounded as if every brick in the pig-man 's house was vibrating and bashing against its neighbors , and behind that the whirring roar of the whirlwind grew louder and louder . He could hear limbs cracking from trees and the ground beneath his hooves shook like a nervous beast . The part of Bandar that was more pig than human - a part that grew larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear - wanted to do nothing but run away . He had to force himself to breathe calmly . He did not look behind him , and did his best to ignore the thunderous cacophony of destruction that battered at his sensitive ears . He shaped his jowly cheeks so , and put his tongue here and tried once more . The thran was only three descending notes , then an octave 's jump . Even Chundlemars could have done it on first try . That realization angered the human side of Bandar . The anger seemed to help . He chanted the three and one and the air rippled obligingly . Before he stepped toward the fissure , he took a look back . After all , no Commons sojourner in living memory had witnessed a full meltdown of a Situation , even a Class Four . He could never mention this episode-how Gabbris would gloat - but he owed himself a last glance . Immediately , he wished he had n't . The trees all around the house had been stripped of their leaves and blown flat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual bricks of which it was made holding their relation to each other though separated by wide gaps through which burst eye-searing flashes of intense violet and electric blue light . The house spun faster and faster , the blasts of painful light coming in sharper paroxysms . Bandar saw the pig-men and the Eater thrown around in the heart of the whirlwind , like torn rags with flopping limbs , each burst of blinding illumination penetrating their flesh to show gaping wounds and fractured bones . Above the roaring of the wind Bandar heard a hum like an insane dynamo . The sound became a whine , then a shriek , climbing through the frequency scale until it rose even above the pitch that pigs could hear . Not good , Bandar said to himself . He scuttled toward the gate . But the last glance back had meant he had waited too long . He did not hear the explosion ; it reached him as a shock wave , picking him off his hooves and hurling him through the fissure . He rolled and tumbled across a grassy prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and beams of nonlight streaming through the gap . Bandar got his feet under him and struggled against the wind back toward the node . Objects struck him , none of them large enough to do harm though he heard something heavy thrum past his head . The gate remained open . That 's not supposed to happen . He chanted a closure thran , then had to repeat the notes before the node would seal completely and the light and wind died . That , too , was something he had never seen . Gates closed automatically . Closure thrans were only for the rare circumstance when a nonaut opened a gate , then decided not to go through it . With him and after him had come through the gate elements of the previous Location : some bricks , a hand-sized piece of slate , some fragments of wood and a few unrecognizable gobbets of flesh and splinters of bone . They lay strewn around him , but as he watched all of the debris melted into the long grass of the prairie , like water seeping into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bandar thought . Material from one Location , whether inert or " living , " was not transferable to another . Experiments had been tried in the distant past and the principle of locational inviolability was unquestioned . Now Bandar had witnessed a definite crossover . His report would make quite a stir , if he ever dared to tell what he had seen and , more culpably , what he had done . And if he ever made it back to human form and out of the Commons without being absorbed and lost forever . He turned now and scanned the prairie , saw nothing to cause alarm . Far off above the eastern horizon a vast storm cloud towered into the otherwise open sky and he saw flickers of lightning from its base . In the same direction he could see tiny dots against the darkening skyline . A herd of ruminants , he thought , remembering the horned and shaggy beasts , herding in their millions , that were an essential feature of this Landscape . Neither storm nor herd concerned Bandar . He deployed and examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairie , none of them far away , as if the Location had been designed as a transit zone for wayfarers . There were a number of such nodal gatherings in the Commons , and some scholars had advanced the notion that the convenience of their existence argued for the nosphere having been intelligently designed . Others held that random distribution could as readily account for the clumping of gates . Besides , the prospect of intelligent design raised the question : by whom ? And that led back to the conundrum of a conscious unconscious - a knot that the scholastic community preferred to leave unpicked . As did Guth Bandar at this moment . He determined that the gate to Happy Valley was about a quarter day 's walk to the east . From there he would jump to the snow kingdom and beg a transformation from its Principal . Then he would summon an emergency gate and plop back into his body in the Institute 's meditation room . He set off toward the gate , his spirits bruised but resuscitated . He wondered if he could draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without specifying the events that had triggered it . Perhaps he could profess ignorance of the cause while detailing the results . Anyone who visited the Location would find it back in its cycle ; the idiomats would know nothing of what had happened to their previous incarnations and all evidence of Bandar 's inadvertent tampering would have dissolved . The more he thought about it , the more possible a paper became . He began to flesh out the essential elements of thesis , argument , and recapitulation . The point to be made was that cross-Locational transfer was indeed possible . Perhaps such things happened often , though only at the end of a Location 's cycle when any sensible nonaut would absent himself rather than risk absorption . That 's it , Bandar thought . I 'll say I bravely stayed to witness the cycle 's renewal and thus saw the movement of material through the gate . He would transform his own folly into courage and produce a commendable result . Didrick Gabbris would chew his cuff in envious gall . Cheered , Bandar trotted on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . Thus occupied , he did not notice what was before him until he felt the first gusts of wind on his pig 's face and the first trembling of the ground beneath his hooves . He was at the base of a small rise , its covering of long grass leaning toward him under the pressure of a growing east wind . He climbed the slope and looked beyond it . As far as he could see , to left and to right in the rapidly failing light , the vfoud was a sea of humping , bumping shapes . A million animals were on the move . And they were moving toward him . Above the herd , the sky was almost black with lowering storm clouds , the narrow band between them , and the earth whipped by rain and rattling sheets of hail . Lightning crackled and thunder rolled across the prairie . The herd moaned and blundered on . Behind Bandar was nothing but open plain ; no cover , no obstacle to break the onslaught of millions of hooves . He could not outrun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To left and right was only grass . But ahead , between him and the oncoming herd , the land sloped down to a small river , barely more than a stream , that wound its way like a contented snake across the prairie . In places , flash floods had cut deep into the thick sod and the clay beneath , leaving the stream to trickle between high banks . And one of those places was not far . Bandar dug his hooves into the prairie sod and raced down the slope , the wind battering him now and the rumble of the herd 's coming shaking the earth like a constant tectonic temblor . He did not look at the animals but fixed his eyes on where the river must be , for he had lost sight of it as soon as he had left the top of the low rise . The thunder of massed hooves now equaled the voice of the storm . They would be on him in moments and still he had not found the river . He wondered if he had somehow veered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only hope of salvation . But even as he conceived the thought , the quaking ground suddenly disappeared from beneath his hooves and he plunged into a gully as deep as he was tall - or as tall as he would be were he still in human form . He hit the shallow water with a shock to his forehooves and immediately scrambled to the far bank where the clay had been hollowed out by a past flood . He pressed himself sideways against the cold wall , feeling it cool his heaving flanks , unable to hear his own panting over the crescendo of hooves heading his way . Something dark hurtled above him , the herd 's first fleet outrunner leaping the gully . Then a second and another , then five more crossing the gap as fast as a drum roll . Now the body of the herd arrived , with the storm right behind it , and the light in the gully dimmed to a crepuscular shadow . But there was nothing Bandar wanted to see . He closed his eyes and hoped that the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thrashing hooves . The stampede went on and on , but the soil above Bandar was woven through with the roots of tough prairie grass . It did not give way . In time , it seemed that the shaking of the ground lessened and that the thunder had rolled on across the plain . Bandar opened his eyes . Beasts were still hurtling over his head but there were gaps between them ; the sky he glimpsed through those gaps was a sullen gray rather than an angry black . A few more animals leapt the gully , then two more , then a single straggler , and now , all at once , the herd had passed . Bandar edged out from under , the overhang , wondering how he could scale the almost vertical clay wall and resume his journey . But the herd had left him a stepping stone : not far away lay the carcass of a beast that had plunged into the little canyon and snapped its neck against the west wall . It lay on its side . Bandar was sure he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern lip of the gully . He trotted toward the dead ruminant , looking for the easiest point on the great corpse to begin his ascent . Thus he was almost upon it before he noticed that the tail , which should have been long and thick and tipped by a tassel of coarse hair , was instead short , hairless , and curled like a corkscrew . The animal 's shoulders and chest , both of which should have been covered by a dense , woolly pelt , were naked and hairless . And now , as Bandar circled the carcass , he saw the head : jowly and wrinkled , with sightless little eyes and a squared-off snout that he had last seen on the face of an enraged pig-man who had sought to crack his spine with a cudgel . That 's not right , Bandar said . Farther down the gully , another animal had fallen on rocks , breaking its back . It still lived and was making guttural grunts that Bandar recognized . He had heard the same sounds under the olive trees on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not light at all . Bandar went back to the dead beast and examined it closely . It was not quite a pig , though it was decidedly piglike . But it had horns and was easily four times the size of even the most prize-winning swine , and the color was wrong . It was someone 's idea of how a pig and a herd beast would look if their gene plasms were mashed together . Bandar had no doubt that this beast was a result of trans-Locational contamination . Which meant he would have an even more interesting paper to present , although the degree of his culpability had just taken a quantum leap . If his role in this event became known , he would be branded a vandal and forbidden ever to enter the Commons except as all humankind did , in his dreams . He climbed onto the dead animal and jumped to the east lip of the gully . The sky ahead was clearing , gray clouds scudding aside to reveal patches of blue . He called up the globe of the Commons again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trot from the egress node . He set off with mixed feelings : glad to be nearer to deliverance but uncomfortably aware that the fused idiomats he had left dead and dying in the gully were a reproach to him . He had not gone far before the wind that had been beating at his face faded and died away . He lifted his head and smelled the rain-scoured air . He could not wait to be restored to human form , but he would miss some of the pig 's senses , especially the breadth and subtlety of the world of odors . He trotted on , letting his mind wander , smelling the crushed grass and the various scents of small flowers that appeared here and there along his way . The wind changed direction , but he did not take account of it when it freshened and gusted against his hams . Then a sudden squall brought the sting of hail . He paused and looked over his shoulder . The sky was dark to the west where the storm had gone , but now he saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . That 's peculiar , he thought . He looked up at the roiling vapors , shot through with flashes of lightning . That 's peculiar , too , he thought , seeing that the flashes seemed tinged with blue and even purple instead of bright actinic white light . He watched for a moment longer , then felt a shiver go through his body that had nothing to do with the chill wind . The sparse hairs on his neck rose and Bandar 's pig 's limbs began to tremble and his spine began to shake . His pig 's lower jaw dropped open and he gaped at the vision that was forming in the cloud . It was a vast shape , the most enormous face he had ever seen , but he recognized it : the long muzzle lined with teeth and ending in a twitching nose , the pointed ears turned his way , the suggestion of a crooked hat towering into the sky , and the huge eyes , lit from within by lightning , that were looking back at him . More than pig-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class Four Situation : the Storm-Eater had come too , and it remembered him . The immense face of Appetite rushed toward him , carried on a sweep of wind and chill rain . Bandar ran . THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS , through the personal unconscious of every human being , engages in a constant dialogue with each of us . So went the opening sura of Afrani 's Explaining and Exploring the Nosphere , the first text encountered by students at the Institute for Historical Inquiry . We may address oui questions , oui thoughts , oui hopes and expectations to the nospheie in direct and pointed queries , but it will always and only reply through indirection and coincidence . Bandar knew his Afrani by heart . It was every neophyte 's first assignment , undertaken not only for the knowledge of the book 's contents but for the necessary taming and strengthening of memory . The words indirection and coincidence now rang in his mind as he fled across the grasslands , the roaring , devouring Storm-Eater at his back . The Commons never spoke directly , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barriers between conscious and unconscious - the oracles and the irredeemably insane - its language was always one of riddle and allusion . Bandar could see that he had been enmeshed in a sequence of coincidences ever since he had left the forest of the Loreleis . The Nymph had turned him into a pig , then he had landed in a Situation where pig-men were the idiomats . The Nymph had turned her donkeys into pursuing hounds - why do that , when donkey hooves could be just as lethal to a small pig as canine fangs ? - then he had been chased by an Eater with decidedly houndlike characteristics . And now he was being harried again by a similar manifestation of the idiomat , though now it sought to sizzle him with lightning bolts instead of clamping sharp teeth into his porcine flesh . In the waking world , coincidences were often just the hazards of chance - a coin could be tossed and come up heads ten times in a row - but in the Commons coincidences were never a mere coincidence . Concurrency was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a message . And what could the message be ? The thought rattled in Bandar 's pig 's brain as he galloped on tiring legs across the gently rolling landscape , while bolts of fluorescent energy struck behind and all around him . What question did I put ? he wondered . He had wanted to know about the Song of songs , the Ur-melody wired into the human brain . But now , as he turned the question over in his mind , examining it from all angles , he could not discover even the most tangential relationship to his present predicament . But if not the Lorelei 's song , then what ! A blast of lightning lit the storm-darkened landscape ahead of him and he swerved around the charred and smoking gouge it had made in the prairie sod . Of course , direct questions to the Commons never brought a clear answer . The key to receiving a message was to think about something else . Then the unconscious would steal through the back door , to leave its offering like the gifts of fairy sprites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all unawares , in his bed . So as he ran Bandar turned his thoughts elsewhere , though it was a difficult task with lethal blasts striking all around him . But he took the attempts on his life as encouragement - what better way to get his attention ? - and set his disciplined mind , even housed in a porcine brain , to the work . He rehearsed his activities before entering the Commons . He had dined with the vicedean of applied metaphysics ; he had filled an order of off-world dyes and fixatives for a longstanding customer ( Bandar ran an inherited family commerciant firm , hence his status at the Institute as only an adjunct scholar ) ; he had reprimanded Chundlemars ; he had sketched an outline of his Lorelei paper . And now it came to him . His pig 's tongue and lips could not put it into words , but he could make the appropriate sounds . " Hmmm , " he said , in the tones of one who has seen the light , then , " Um hmm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit up the landscape and by its light , just ahead , Bandar saw an unlikely sight : a hummock of prairie land was transforming itself into another shape . In moments , Bandar found himself rushing toward a small but sturdy brick house , its stout door invitingly open . He crossed the threshold at a gallop , skidded on his hooves as he turned to get his nose behind the door and push it closed . The wind resisted his efforts but he found renewed strength and when the door met its jamb , a lock clicked and the barrier stood proof against the storm . The single room was bereft of furniture although there were three framed pictures on the back wall , each portraying an anthropomorphically rendered pig in a stiff-collared shirt and dark suit . Centered in the same wall was a wide and tall fireplace with a black cauldron simmering over a well-stoked blaze . Bandar crossed to the kettle and found that the handle of its lid had been designed to fit a pig 's trotter , confirming his surmise of what must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forehoof into the handle and prised the lid from the cauldron . It came easily . No sooner was the cover free than the chimney rattled to a downdraft of cold air . Sparks flew and smoke billowed , setting Bandar 's eyes to water and causing him to vent an explosive sneeze . But even blind he could hear the sploosh of something solid arriving in the cauldron . He immediately clapped the lid back into place . The kettle rumbled and shook but Bandar leaned his weight onto the leaping , vibrating top until the commotion ceased . Outside the storm had ended .
