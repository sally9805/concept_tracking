After admiring old New England murals from afar , Jane and Phil Workman did extensive research into the history and techniques of 19th-century itinerant painters and commissioned a few traditional-style murals for their own home // When Phil and Jane Workman lived in Florida , they made frequent antiquing trips to New England . " I always booked us in old B and Bs , " recalls Jane , " partly because I love their murals . " She never dreamed that one day she would be surrounded by murals on the walls of an old New England house of her own . But in 1995 , Phil 's company transferred him to New Hampshire , and the Workmans found this 1805 farmhouse in the town of New Boston . " Because there was a minimum of woodwork and wainscoting on the walls , " says Jane , " I knew the house would lend itself beautifully to the kind of murals and stencil work I love . " She and Phil hired David Wiggins , an itinerant painter in the old New England tradition of Rufus Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , together with Wiggins , they reviewed Jean Lipman 's book Rufiis Porter , Yankee Pioneer for inspiration . Then , like the itinerant painters of yore , Wiggins moved in for a week at a time to work on each room , painting in oil , casein , and tempera . Though the finished murals are certainly striking , they never distract from the 19th-century furniture that the Workmans bought on those up-from-Florida antiquing trips . " The good thing about folk murals , " observes Wiggins , " is that they define the space and create an enclosure , but they do n't really dominate a room .

" The trees , with their free brushwork , are very characteristic of Porter 's murals . " Wiggins says . " They 're important because they lend movement to the scene . " The diamond pattern Wiggins painted on the floor is also typical of the mid 1800s . FOR RESOURCES ADDRESS INDEX . Sidebar The bowback Windsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear the original green paint .

" I said , ' My word , that 's our wall ! ' " Jane recalls . " It 's very rare to find any of these painted panels ; to find one just like ours is really remarkable .
