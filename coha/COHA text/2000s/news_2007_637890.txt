<p> Friday 's 4.2 magnitude earthquake was a wake-up call in more ways than one . <p> The temblor roused Bay Area residents at 4:42 a.m. and , while seismically classified as minor , it was powerful enough to scare even those who experienced the 6.9-magnitude Loma Prieta shaker in 1989 . <p> The head-scratcher was : Why did Friday 's five-second shaking seem so strong ? <p> U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Rufus Catchings said the quake felt very intense  --  particularly in Berkeley , 5 miles from the epicenter off Butters Drive in the Oakland hills on the Hayward Fault  --  because of something called the directivity effect , or where the quake 's energy is directed . <p> " The energy was directed north , so it felt stronger 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) north in Berkeley than at the epicenter , " said USGS seismologist Steve Walter . " There was very strong shaking under Berkeley . " <p> The Hayward Fault is a strike-slip fault , where each side moves horizontally in opposite directions , as opposed to a common fault , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Strike-slip faults " give very strong  --  if you 're nearby  --  initial jolts from the ( primary ) wave and then rattling for a couple seconds from the ( secondary ) wave , " Catchings explained . " Anytime the Earth moves beneath you , it 's a little unsettling , no matter who you are . " <p> The energy moved northwest along the fault and , by the time it rose to the ground in Berkeley , was nearly vertical , Walter said , " so it came up from under Berkeley and hit them harder . " <p> You did n't have to tell that to Alex Sieu . <p> The 20-year owner of Dream Fluff Donuts on Ashby Avenue was already at work when the earthquake hit , knocking a large piece of glass out of his window display onto about 100 doughnuts . <p> " I thought somebody threw a cinderblock , " said Sieu , adding that Friday 's event felt stronger than Loma Prieta to him . <p> Friday 's quake could be felt as far north as Santa Rosa and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Jose , said USGS spokeswoman Leslie Gordon . A few people in the Oakland hills felt a 2.8 aftershock that hit at 5:48 p.m . <p> Gordon said about 5,500 people registered Friday morning to access a map on the USGS Web site , which allows the public to report where the earthquake was felt and how strongly . The map showed weak to light shaking in the East Bay and North Bay , as well as in San Francisco and the northern area of the Peninsula . <p> But it was moderate to strong in Berkeley , lending credence to many East Bay residents ' claims that the initial jolt was jarring  --  and strong enough to knock some bricks off the chimney of Karen Toloui 's home . <p> " Something woke me up  --  my mirror shook , " said 3-year-old Montclair resident Maddy Cometa , who was walking with her tired father to get coffee . Tom Cometa said it was the worst quake he could recall in his 15 years in the Bay Area . He said it knocked down pictures and knickknacks in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that big before  --  it was just like , ' Wow , this was a big one , ' " 14-year-old Louie Reed added as he played hockey in his backyard near the epicenter just off Butters Drive in the Oakland hills , near the Mormon Temple . <p> " It was very sudden , very strong , " said Caroline Aszklar , who lives on Butters Drive . " It woke me up right away . " <p> Don MacInnes , 75 , also lives near the epicenter , on Crestmont Drive . " It really woke me up , " he said . " I 've been through so many earthquakes you get used to them . I have people on the East Coast who call me and say , ' Is n't it terrible ? ' But I tell them by the time you figure out what 's going on , it 's over . " <p> At UC Berkeley 's Boalt Law Library , the early morning shaker damaged several 19th century Swiss law books , whose bindings were ripped when they toppled from shelves . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the unopened boxes of " Harry Potter " books at Sullivan 's Montclair Pharmacy . <p> " Harry survived , " said owner Joe Sullivan , who at first told his son he was having a bad dream when Ryan Sullivan started out of bed yelling " earthquake ! " <p> " At this point , yes , ( I believe him ) , " Sullivan said as he cleaned up shampoo bottles , prescription drugs and other merchandise strewn across his store . <p> Gordon , however , said the quake was " pretty minor " from a geological standpoint . <p> " We consider that a light earthquake . It 's not unusual , " she said . " It did n't interrupt doughnut production . " <p> It 's possible , though , that the temblor was a foreshock that could be followed by stronger seismic events , Catchings said . <p> " To be very honest , we ca n't tell , but we do look at that kind of thing , and it 's not unheard of for something like this to be followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3.8 magnitude quake on another fault about 100 miles north at The Geysers around 10:50 a.m . Friday , which may have been related . <p> " It 's not an aftershock because it 's far away , but it 's within the realm of possibility that it may have been triggered or influenced by ( Friday ) morning 's quake , " Gordon said . " There are commonly a lot of small earthquakes up there . " <p> Gordon and Catchings urged Bay Area residents to use Friday 's seismic event as a reminder to prepare for the Big One . <p> " People should take this as a wake-up call that something much bigger could happen , and take this as a lesson to prepare , " Catchings said . <p> Said Gordon : " Just be ready . " <p> Earthquake preparedness <p> A recent American Red Cross survey found that 83 percent of Bay Area residents are not prepared for an emergency , whether earthquake , terror attack or wildfire . <p> The agency suggests local residents do the following : <p>  --  Make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , and choose two places to meet in the event of an emergency , one outside the home and one outside your neighborhood . Find out how and when to turn off utilities and have a personal contact outside the immediate area . <p>  --  Get a kit : Store supplies that will last three days , and include one gallon of water per person per day , nonperishable food , flashlights , a first-aid kit and a battery-operated radio . You can buy premade emergency kits online , or make your own . <p>  --  Be informed and get trained : Learn basic first aid and CPR , and know to drop , cover and hold on during an earthquake . Stay inside until the shaking stops . <p>  --  If you live in Oakland , you can now get a retrofitting permit for your home at a quarter of the normal cost . The new law also allows home buyers to get a rebate of up to $5,000 on their city transfer tax if they retrofit their homes . There will be grants for retrofitting available in 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information .
