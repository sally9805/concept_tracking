Man and Camel On the eve of my fortieth birthday I sat on the porch having a smoke when out of the blue a man and a camel happened by . Neither uttered a sound at first , but as they drifted up the street and out of town the two of them began to sing . Yet what they sang is still a mystery to me -- the words were indistinct and the tune too ornamental to recall . Into the desert they went and as they went their voices rose as one above the sifting sound of windblown sand . The wonder of their singing , its elusive blend of man and camel , seemed an ideal image for all uncommon couples . Was this the night that I had waited for so long ? I wanted to believe it was , but just as they were vanishing , the man and camel ceased to sing , and galloped back to town . They stood before my porch , staring up at me with beady eyes , and said : " You ruined it . You ruined it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others slept , I climbed the stairs to the roof of the house and under a sky strewn with stars I gazed atthe sea , at the spread of it , the rolling crests of it raked by the wind , becoming like bits of lace tossed in the air . I stood in the long , whispering night , waiting for something , a sign , the approach of a distant light , and I imagined you coming closer , the dark waves of your hair mingling with the sea , and the dark became desire , and desire the arriving light . The nearness , the momentary warmth of you as I stood on that lonely height watching the slow swells of the sea break on the shore and turn briefly into glass and disappear . . . Why did I believe you would come out of nowhere ? Why with all that the world offers would you come only because I was here ? Mother and Son The son enters the mother 's room and stands by the bed where the mother lies . The son believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is her boy , always her boy . The son leans down to kiss the mother 's lips , but her lips are cold . The burial of feelings has begun . The son touches the mother 's hands one last time , then turns and sees the moon 's full face . An ashen light falls across the floor . If the moon could speak , what would it say ? If the moon could speak , it would say nothing . My Name Once when the lawn was a golden green and the marbled moonlit trees rose like fresh memorials in the scented air , and the whole countryside pulsed with the chirr and murmur of insects , I lay in the grass , feeling the great distances open above me , and wondered what I would become and where I would find myself , and though I barely existed , I felt for an instant that the vast star-clustered sky was mine , and I heard my name as if for the first time , heard it the way one hears the wind or the rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me but to the silence from which it had come and to which it would go .
