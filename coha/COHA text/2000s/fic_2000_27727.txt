If you have come for a long stay , you must arrive at Grange House by water . The House sits at the farthest edge of the harbor from Middle Haven town , the last habitation before the harbor gives way to the open sea , and though a road runs between the town and Grange House , it is narrow and rockyentirely unsuitable for the conveyance of large families with luggage . Rather , you must take the night steamer from Boston , which deposits you at the Grange House pier before teatime . I like to stand in the prow of that boat , steaming farther and farther north and east , and be the first to feel the air sharpen and cool , leaving the damp heat of Boston , the shipyards at Portsmouth , and voyaging into the clear silence born in the chill air of Maine . And though I watch for it , I am never prepared for the first sight of Grange House on its point , though I know the approach , and early learned to read where the slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite boulders marking the entrance to Middle Haven 's harbor . If you have arrived this way , most likely you are what the native people like to call a rusticator , a city dweller come for the cooler air of the north . From the pier , the steamer 's side appears lined with such visitors as she draws near , and the captain brings her along at a smart clip . Then he gives the engineer two bells and a jingle and guides her right in . You can see the mate now , waiting with the forward spring line in his hand before he tosses that hawser neatly over the piling just as the bow nudges alongside . He holds it , straining , and she 's inagainst the pier with hardly ajar . You are arrived into a mayhem of unloading , the wharf dipping below the weight of trunks and summer guests . There you stand , surrounded by the men 's cries and the groaning creak of the steamer 's lines straining against the pier ; and then you turn and look up the lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its granite foundation . In such a way , I came again to Grange House in July of 1896 , this place at once familiar and always strange . Long ago , my father had invested in the Grange quarry , but then the place itself took hold . When the quarryman 's mansion turned hotel to a few select city families , he fixed the habit of returning every year , though Mama protested , bemoaning the distinct lack of variety in a landscape of spruce and pine . Nonetheless , the enormous old house suited the high pitch of my nerves that summer . At seventeen , I was as eager to know the world as it seemed eager to shroud itself from me , and fretful at what I thought were my bonds , I had begun to wear my white dresses like flags , a slim Crusoe signaling for the distant triangle of sails to break the flat line of what appeared to me but an endless , dulled sea . As I followed behind my father and mother , I looked up at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there watching our advance up the lawn from the windows of her attic room . I never thought of Grange House without that figure standing in it . That afternoon , I did not see her , but , hoping she still looked for my return , I held my gloved hand up in a small salute . " Maisie , " Mama called from the top stair of the verandah . " I am here , " I replied , dropping my hand down to my side , but she had already swung round to follow my father across the threshold into the House , not lingering to take in the view . I cast one last glance upward , and then , gathering my skirts , took the remainder of the lawn with quick feet . My parents were stopped just inside , next to Mrs. French , the long , wide front hallway stretching past them , with its several doors to the public rooms swung open and the hubbub of teatime voices issuing into the air . It was ever so , year after year : here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut bayberry , the branches stuffed into matching copper pots upon the table , the silvery green leaves waxy as ever against the paper roses upon the wall . It was only I who seemed to change , a knife cut in the vergeless surface of the place , my arrival cleaving one summer from the next . And that afternoon in July , I remember thinking I was like the Prince returning to the Sleeping Beauty 's castle . Let the story begin , I thought impatiently , now that I am herethough what I meant by that , I had not the slightest idea . " Well , well , my dear ! " the housekeeper cried out on seeing me upon the threshold , and she beamed the compliment over to Mama , who smiled absently , pulling off her gloves . " Are we to have our usual rooms , Mrs. French ? I am quite in need of a little rest . " " Yes , of course . Please , Mrs. Thomas , to follow me . " " Welcome , Thomases , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all three turned round , to see the cook of Grange House standing silently there , her arms crossed over her bosom . Mama gave only the briefest of nods before turning to follow Mrs. French , who waited at the bottom of the stairs . " Cook . " Papa bowed kindly to the woman . " Good afternoon , Mr. Thomas , " she answered , dismissing him as she leaned slightly back against the door frame and turned her gaze upon me . Papa never seemed to mind the cook 's inexplicable command of their encounters , and I had by now grown accustomed to this woman 's yearly scrutiny . Yet that afternoon , I relished the chance to consider her in turn , and I calmly lifted my eyes to hers and smiled . For an instant , I thought she shivered . " Maisie Thomas , " she said , swiftly uncrossing her arms , " how you have grown . " And without another word , she withdrew . Never mind , I thought , a bit disconcerted , she is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grange House from belowstairs , and Mrs. French who held public sway in the middle rooms and floors , nonetheless it was the topmost figureshe whom I had watched for on our arrivalwho was the possessing spirit of the place . I dressed quickly for dinner that evening , descending before my parents to station myself at the foot of the stairs and there await the attic inhabitant of Grange House . And long after the other guests had assembled , passing me by with a nod and a greeting , and after Mama and Papa had issued through to join them , it was she whom I now imagined descending the wooden attic stairs from her room at the top of the House to reach the servants ' hall upon the third floor , then down the next stairs into the regions of the second floor , where the large rooms of her family 's time had been changed to accommodate we summer people come to stay . Then on down the widest stairway , into the bright , hospitable lights of a fashionable hotel shining its face up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shiver of bodies just cased in new dresses and thin suits , into the soft mayhem of summer eveningswhen our lives might suddenly thrill , and open . " Miss Grange ! " I smiled up . She caught her breath on seeing me and paused in her descent . " Maisie Thomas . " Though there was pleasure in her voice , the deep-sunk blue of her eyes regarded me with a touch of bewilderment . I supposed she saw what my mirror told : My cheeks now held the shape of a woman 's face , and beneath the dark brown eyes turned to welcome her lay the secret longings of my untried heart . I had caught Mama watching me furtively , as though she read a hidden chapter in my familiar face , and even Jessiewho had dressed and tended me since I was a girlexploded forth from time to time despite herself , ripping out the seams of my bodices and commenting dryly about " welcome attentions . " " Miss Grange ? " I hesitated . She recovered herself . " How greatly you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand beneath my arm so we proceeded together into the hum of the bright gathering . Miss Grange was something of an enigma for the summer guests . She did not own the hotel , yet she inspired a curious respect . When she did choose to come among us , she was greeted as a visiting dignitary , or even as a monarch long exiled from the proceedings of her own court . It is not to be thought that she was important in any pertinent way . Rather , her magnificence derived from the fact of her lineage . Hers was a family whose roots were among the first to stretch down into American soil . No one knew precisely her connection to the men who had built this House , but it was commonly assumed she was a distant and poor relation who had come here to live after the main branch of the family passed away . Thus , her romance derived from her situation : She was the last Grange remaining . The history of her family preceded her into the very rooms it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plutocrats arrived at the fortunes that brought them here . And among the younger guests , there were the whispered rumors of buried wealth , the half-uttered suggestions of a lost love , of a secret pact into which she had entered when she came into the House . Once , Papa told me that she had been an authoress , yet surely none of her stories could rival the stew pot simmering at the back of the guests ' imaginations . Thus was Miss Grange cast as a living character in the casual entertainment of city folk seeking simplicity under the sharp lines of a Maine sky . Simplicity , that is to say , inmixed with a good country intrigue . " Here is Miss Grange , " I said , drawing her to where my parents conversed , and Mama and Papa turned round . Mama 's mouth opened into the vague and generous smile she always gave when her thoughts tended elsewhere , but Papa took Miss Grange 's hand in his , visibly startled . " Butyou are not well ? " Miss Grange stiffened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not reply . " Really , Ludlow , " Mama interposed . " Forgive him , Miss Grange . You look wonderfully well , as always , " and she drew her hand beneath Papa 's arm , turning him as the dinner bell sounded . Gallantly , he offered his other arm to Miss Grange , who did not take it but walked at his side into the dining room . That night , several of the other guests had gone to a supper party being held in a neighboring hotel , so the dining room was laid with quite diminished table settings , and our little group joined the two solitary diners already seated at our customary table : Mr. Cuttingthe illustrious and tiresome schoolmaster , whose head gleamed in the gas-light like a polished knob where he sat , starched napkin at the ready , his spoon poised in his hand , awaiting his soupand the large and definitively unaccompanied Mrs. Hunnowell . It would seem , she informed us without prelude , that she was utterly abandoned . Her husband had returned to Boston for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really could n't say , her eyes rolling indulgently at the empty chair beside her . I smiled . Year after year , Mrs. Hunnowell did not disappoint , remaining the kind of woman whose conversation consisted mainly of melodramas she concocted , her head tilted upward , as if the endings hovered just above us in the painted heavens of the room . I took the abandoned chair beside her , knowing full well that Bartholomew , her son , could never be depended upon to be in the ordinary place at the ordinary time . Having penned a series of very successful travel books for those on their grand tour , Mr. Hunnowell proceeded through life , appearing and disappearing very much like the kind of train he advised young men to catchoff schedule and bound for unknown parts . Mama entirely disapproved of his unsettled behaviora man of thirty , after all ! Even as I could not dismiss him so entirely , I did find him disquieting . One never knew with him precisely where one stoodor rather , where he stood . For every summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide array of rolesbrave gallant , avid sportsman , irreverent parlor manand then a sometimes Bedouin intensity would flash out amongst the parts , making him unreadable , provokingly so . " After all , " Mr. Cutting 's musing broke in , " the day turned out to be fine . " Mama nodded politely at him , and as Mrs. Hunnowell motioned the serving girl forward to begin , I put aside all thoughts of Bart Hunnowell and his character . Amid the clatter of the serving of the soup , I studied Miss Grange across the table . Though she could not be more than fifty , the winter past seemed to have settled an elderly gray upon her cheeks , and a blue vein pulsed too brightly upon her hand . Papa was right . There was something shifted , for I do not think I imagined the heavy sadness deep down in Miss Grange 's eyes , now giving them the kind of deathly beauty of a poem : Pale beyond porch and portal , I repeated to myself , Crowned with calm leaves she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I reddened and looked down . I have been reading too much Swinburne , I thought , and smiled to myself . " Will you please to just look at that ? " Mrs. Hunnowell breathed beside me , and I caught the erstwhile rose hip slip from behind her ear , to fall upon the broad pavilion of her bosom . I followed her gaze out the side window , where , indeed , a fleet and incomplete tableau had formed of the sort the summer guests most appreciated . Now a man 's uncovered head leaned down to whisper into the ear of a young woman . From where we sat , the woman stood too small for us to see more than just the gentle swell of her forehead , though her hand had flown up to rest upon the back of the man 's neck . And then in an instant , they had parted . But just as the young man turned , I caught sight of his face . " Henry Brown ! " I said aloud . " But who is the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reply . Yet something of the tilt of her head had called to mind Halcy Ames , I realized a bit wistfully , watching Henry Brown 's sturdy back and shoulders advance without haste down the lawn toward his boat , oblivious to the rapt attention we paid his small encounter . I could not think of Halcy Ames without a twinge of regret , for once upon a time we had been staunch companions , though she was Cook 's daughter and I a guest . As a child , she had done light maid 's work at Grange House in the mornings , filling each guest room 's fireplace with new wood and making fresh the beds upstairs . Younger than I by two years , she was pretty in her waytiny , her hands completing her tasks as efficiently as wood squirrels about their trees , and I grew accustomed to accompanying her as she went about the beds , fetching clean linens and smoothing spreads at her command . Then one day , she was tidying my mother 's dressing table , straightening the glass bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling Mama 's scarves from her dresser drawer . We were busy talking , standing side by side , looking at each other in the looking glass above the table , resembling nothing so much as sisters that morning , our two small faces animated and dancing as we talkedso we did not hear Mama 's hand on the knob , but when she suddenly spoke from behind us , Halcy jumped so , she knocked one of Mama 's perfume bottles off the table . It made a terrific noise , shattering into several tiny pieces at our feet . " Oh ! You clumsy girl ! " Mama exclaimed . " Just see what you have done ! " I leapt stoutly to Halcy 's defense . " But you startled us , Mama . " " A good serving girl , Maisie , must learn to be always on the ready for the entrance of her mistress without event . Fetch a broom , please , Halcy , and clear this away . " Halcy 's eyes met mine in the mirror as she passed from the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , but from that day on , she began to call me Miss Thomas , and though I teased her about it , she persisted . This insistence on my formal name hurt me so that gradually I ceased to search her out in the mornings , the divide between us widening to a polite silence . Papa 's elbow jostled against me as he rose from dinner . All about me there was movement and sound , and I winnowed back up into the clutter of life . Papa stood , his hand upon Mama 's chair as he listened to Miss Grange recounting the terrible storm that had blown down three of the laurels out front , her combs like smooth shells held against the slick water of her hair . Mama sat poised , I could see , to detail the season 's toll on her own garden . I pushed back my chair , suddenly vexed . Around me in the dining room came the same bursts of voice , the hushed movements of the maids as they cleared away the unused silver and the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above the mantel , the stilted figures of a couple embraced upon their horses in a forgotten English vale . Everything was just as it always was ! I longed for somethinganythingso long as it happened . I sprung out from the slow-moving throng with its discussion of winter , stepping ahead through the low-lit front hall and out , out into the night , onto the piazza , whose white columns glowed against the black sparkle of the harbor under stars . Far down the lawn , some of the men strolled , and their white collars flashed in and out of the dark like fireflies . If they turned to regard the fine old house , I would be indistinguishable , a light shadow of white against the white . Under this blanketing velvet dark containing its faraway men and cigars , I yearned for color , a bright sweep of red flames to flare into being . It was n't clarity or vision I wanted , nosay instead that I had come to perceive there was something I lacked . That year , I had begun to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if pressing my ear to a door . Then it seemed the pages would sing out some strange song and , slight music that it was , I 'd feel an answering swell of dim comprehension , though I knew that mine was the echo of the song , not the song itself . Sorrow ; Rage ; even a high , vaunting Gladnessthese were foreign breezes from countries to which I had never voyaged , so each book became my little craft , each page a sail set out to catch those distant winds upon which Bront , Pliny , Chapman , Ovid , all , indiscriminate , seemed to play . And I would sit at my window and strain into the dark behind the glass , longing to see through into the heat of my life , into the knowledge that I , too , would possess something at the heart of me to tell ; that there was a promise held out for me . For me alone . " Good night , Miss Maisie Thomas . " Miss Grange 's soft voice stole around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt caught out . I turned to my friend . " Good night , Miss Grange . " But she had already vanished through the dark doorway , and I could just hear Papa 's muffled voice inside , pausing in his conversation to bid her good night as she passed by . In my mind 's eye , I followed the tidy figure as she mounted slowly to her room , imagining the light on her table rising , seeing her draw back the curtain to stand at her window . And my eyes refocused with hers , staring out at the white collars pocking the dark lawn . One separated from the crowd with a casual laugh backward over his shoulder . It appeared he had a meeting . My heart throbbed . I strained my eyes into the dark , but the lights from inside the house cast an obscuring perimeter . I stepped around to the corner of the piazza , which ran in front of the now-darkened dining room , and peered out . There ! There was a white dress . It waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs of the man switch through the grasses . The two were meeting in a near corner of one of the fields that stretched by the side of the front lawn . I watched the collar bend , like a star gliding down to the waiting sea . I watched the two white arms rise .
