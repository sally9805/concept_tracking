My relationship with the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant 's cooling tower , which stood for more than 30 years beside the Columbia River in northwestern Oregon , ended on May 21 , 2006 , when the tower was imploded into rubble . I know now that the giant , hyperbolically curved tower I first saw from a train on the other side of the Columbia River was gray . But in my memory the tower appears to glow brick red , and to dwarf the mountains of Oregon 's Coast Range in the background . Built from 40,500 cubic yards of concrete , the tower rose 499 feet above the riverbank , and its destruction was meant to be a moment of high nuclear drama . Portland General Electric ( PGE ) , the utility that operated the plant from 1975 until it was shut down in 1993 , was supposedly signaling its final surrender in Oregon 's expensive " Trojan War " over commercial nuclear power . The Oregonian 's banner headline the following day read " Bye-bye Trojan : Tower is blasted into history . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic demolition was a reminder of a day when I ran away from that cooling tower in the spring of 1981 . I was living on the Oregon coast then with my family , while I tried to write a book about the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant . On that cool spring day I decided to run along the beach at low tide from Tolovana Park to Hug Point and back , some seven miles roundtrip , in an outfit that consisted of scarlet silk long johns , a pair of bright green running shorts , a green sweatshirt , and a green baseball cap with golden wings protruding to the side and back . <p> Northern Oregon beaches were seldom crowded in the spring , and on the day I made that run , more spectacularly attired than I had ever been before , they seemed deserted . I ca n't remember seeing a single person . The solitary sign that I was making an important fashion statement came as I turned at Hug Point to head back home : I was attacked by a gull . While it followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was more offended by my winged hat or my red fights . <p> If I had run north from Tolovana Park instead of heading south toward Hug Point , my chances of meeting appreciative observers would have increased exponentially . I would have been running toward the town of Cannon Beach , and on the southwest end of town is Haystack Rock , a large monolith that attracts a lot of attention . On almost any day without rain there are likely to be people gathered at low tide next to dais huge rock to observe the sea birds that nest on it , as well as the many fascinating creatures in its tidal pools . Past Haystack Rock , almost to Ecola Creek on the north side of Cannon Beach , is a stretch of sand to which William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition led a party of 11 , including the Shoshone woman , Sacajawea , and Clark 's slave , York , on a two-day journey from their winter quarters , Fort Clatsop . When they found what they were looking for , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvested its oil and blubber . Nevertheless , Clark recorded his estimate that the whale had measured 105 feet in its happier days at sea . <p> I ran south that day in 1981 , away from the town , the rock , and thoughts of Clark 's failed whaling expedition , partly because I was fed up with civilization and its cooling towers . I can say without being melodramatic that I was fleeing the Trojan Nuclear Plant 's cooling tower , which rose some 50 miles northeast of the beach where I was running . I had spent the year trying to learn enough to write a book about what it meant . I had come to see the cooling tower as one of the most sensible things about commercial nuclear power , but an accident almost two years earlier at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania had temporarily put cooling towers up there with mushroom clouds as symbols of nuclear danger . And as I thought about the difficulties I 'd encountered during the year , trying to talk with people at PGE who ran Oregon 's only nuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affront . The people at PGE had begun to treat me as an enemy in Oregon 's Trojan War , and they brushed me aside like a pesky mosquito . <p> Being pushed aside by nuclear bureaucracies has long been a family hardship . After World War II ended , punctuated by the two nuclear explosions in Japan , my father left his job at the Swan Island shipyard on the Willamette River and moved up the Columbia River to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington . He kept records on construction projects , probably working with some of the people who made plutonium for the atomic bomb we dropped on Nagasaki in August of 1945 . The rest of our family stayed in Portland , and sometime in the winter of 1947 , I took a train ride to visit Dad for a weekend . I remember the uniformed guards , the high wire fences , the heavily chlorinated water , and the stark landscape . It was a place with the feel of a military base or a prison . The afternoon before I returned to Portland , Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , where we got not a nibble in water I learned many years later had been polluted with high-level radioactive waste , I felt a sense of being watched . In late spring of that year , Dad suddenly resigned from his job and came home . <p> He was out of work for more than a year and spent much of his time at Portland 's main public library writing essays about business . His essays were n't published , and I ca n't find them now . They probably revealed no secrets , although he must have known a few , but they surely expressed his conviction that the sloppy workmanship and irresponsibility he found at Hartford are the inevitable result whenever private business gets mixed up with big government . When he talked with friends about his decision to resign and come home , he told stories of engineers who questioned designs or the quality of materials and were promptly fired or transferred . Now I realize he was talking about carelessness and arrogance blanketed in governmental secrecy , a theme as timely as the current skirmishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably saying too that if the bosses would n't listen to engineers , they certainly would n't pay attention to him . <p> In the summer of 1961 , when I was working for a construction company in Portland , my boss took me aside one day to talk about my father . Maybe I had said something that hinted at my growing skepticism about Dad 's politics , because my boss looked me in the eye pretty intensely , as though daring me to show a sign of youthful , cocksure certitude . He said that Al Nichols was a man committed to doing things right and claimed he 'd seen my quiet , cautious father get very , angry when he ran into careless work . " Your father , " he said , " takes it very personally . " This one-sided conversation made me wonder what Dad might have said to people at the nuclear reservation when he resigned . <p> My father died in 1986 , before the public learned of leaks at Hanford from underground storage tanks for high-level radioactive waste or the continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radioactive iodine from Hanford that got into the local milk supply or the massive radioactive contamination of the Columbia River or the dangerous radiation exposures of workers . But he would n't have been surprised by those revelations . He might have said what I 've come to believe is true , that such atrocities are inevitable in the making of modern war , but he would have emphasized the dangers in carelessness too . Reflecting on the wastefulness and irresponsibility he saw at Hanford seemed to drive him politically to the fight during the years after he resigned . <p> My mother had a gentle spirit and spent much of her adult life caring for sick relatives and friends . She grew up in a working-class , Democratic home , and her father , a union man , drove a city bus . As a married woman , my mother became a conservative Republican along with my father . Her younger sister , Virginia , took political positions well to the right of my mother 's , and for several years she and my Uncle George worked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who , having said the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , were a result of God 's anger at feminists , homosexuals , abortion rights supporters , and civil liberties activists , later sought to soften his indictment by saying it was " ill-timed . " <p> A psychoanalyst might say I was fleeing my extended family as well as civilization and its cooling towers on that day in 1981 , and there would be some truth in this therapeutic view of the matter . But the 2006 dynamiting of Trojan 's cooling tower got my full attention as a political act . The dramatic , well-publicized destruction of the tower was meant to symbolize the end of years of conflict between PGE and those who opposed commercial nuclear power in Oregon . However , cooling towers should be the least of anyone 's worries . We still do n't have a safe repository for the radioactive waste stored in the Trojan 's spent-fuel pool . There continue to be important questions about the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada , although we 've spent $9 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for 2008 , an increase of $49 million from 2007 . Unexpected radioactive isotopes have been found in nuclear plants ' cooling systems , causing long-term radiation hazards much greater than anyone anticipated when the industry planned to encase such plants in concrete after they go out of service . Concrete entombment wo n't be effective unless the most dangerous materials are removed , and much of that work will have to be done with expensive robotic technology . The decommissioning process is sure to produce large amounts of additional high-level nuclear waste because the equipment used for disassembling the reactor will be bombarded by radioactivity . Decommissioning nuclear power plants is much more difficult than toppling cooling towers , and the industry is not prepared to do it properly . <p> And then , of course , there 's the vulnerability of nuclear reactors and spent-fuel pools to accidents , earthquakes , and terrorist attacks . Recent earthquake damage to the largest nuclear facility in existence , Japan 's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant , built to be nearly earthquake proof , makes one wonder about the safety of plants all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 1986 accident at Chernobyl , a result of flawed reactor design and badly trained operators , contaminated almost 20 square miles with radioactive isotopes , some with half-lives of tens of thousands of years . Well-placed explosives would turn a reactor or a spent-fuel pool into a " dirty bomb " that could cause many thousands of deaths and render a wide landscape uninhabitable for a similarly long time . One grim reminder of this danger occurred on September 11 , 2001 , when the four terrorist-piloted airliners passed near some 12 nuclear power plants on their way toward their symbolic targets . <p> On a clear day in mid-April of 1981 , a week or so after my scarlet-legged jog on Oregon 's north coast , I interviewed the president of PGE . After several months of unanswered letters and phone calls , I had mailed PGE management a draft of a short essay I 'd written about their closed-door policy , and the company 's general counsel called to say the list of employees I 'd asked to interview about their nuclear plant was inadequate : William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed to meet . As I walked into Lindblad 's office , the plume from the Trojan nuclear plant 's cooling tower , some 35 miles northwest of Portland , was visible through the window . The office resembled a tastefully appointed chapel  --  the furniture simple , the view through the window as colorful as stained glass . Lindblad himself , tall and severe in a dark suit , might have been a Puritan minister , his faith in nuclear technology angry and deep . He had , as it turned out , no intention of revealing anything about Trojan ; instead , he meant to convince me that my effort to tell its story might be an unpardonable sin . <p> Commercial nuclear power was blessed at its birth with the hope-filled metaphor of beating swords into plowshares , but it was soon apparent to people who thought about it that nuclear plowshares could n't be fully separated from those deadly swords and the secrecy they demanded . Commercial nuclear power , after all , grew out of the Manhattan Project , which was such a big secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after President Roosevelt died , and the connection between commercial nuclear power and nuclear weapons has never been completely broken . Today , the federal government is encouraging domestic utilities to build nuclear plants , although , for almost three decades , building them was n't considered a sound investment . Dangerous uranium mining has also become a growth industry again . At the same time , our leaders have been hinting at the possibility of going to war if Iron persists in processing its own nuclear fuel because it 's a relatively short step from mastering the nuclear fuel cycle to building nuclear weapons . <p> William Lindblad spent most of an afternoon explaining why my version of the Trojan story would be a disservice to humanity . Convincing someone who was more than 10 months into a writing project to drop it is not very different from suggesting to an avid skier who has carried his skis far up a beautiful slope on foot to shoulder those skis and trudge back down , but Lindblad tried . He began by telling me of an experience in California when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A television producer asked him about doing a show on the Diablo Canyon plant , and Lindblad said he was too busy to help . A colleague , however , thought it was wrong to send the producer away , and he cooperated . The result was a television show that led to several lawsuits . His colleague , Lindblad said , left the industry , disillusioned because his integrity had been challenged . <p> " I 've deliberately tried to give you nothing quotable , " Lindblad said as the afternoon wore on , " but here is something : the accident at Three Mile Island is still going on . " Lindblad left his statement hanging in the air as a measure of my inability to plumb the mysteries of nuclear power . Perhaps he meant to say simply this : the accident at Three Mile Island had led to fear and misunderstanding , which two years later were crippling the nuclear industry financially . <p> The ultimate proof that I could not be trusted to tell this story , Lindblad went on , was my choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grind because I assumed nuclear power plants were different from other technologies . <p> To me , the stakes do seem higher for nuclear technology than for most other things humans have built . Humans tend to make errors , and one nuclear error can produce a catastrophe , I was trying to make a point that Jon Gertner later made in The New York Times Magazine on July 16 , 2006 : " Nuclear power plants are arguably the most complicated machines in the history of civilization . " To suggest my balanced view of such matters , I added that I was skeptical of claims made for other high technologies as well . <p> " What is high technology ? " Lindblad thundered . <p> I mumbled something about complexity , dependence on advanced scientific knowledge , initially large capital investment , and expensive maintenance . <p> Peering sternly over his glasses , Lindblad corrected me : for him the cockpit of a DC-10 was high technology , not the control room of a nuclear power plant . High technology , he insisted , was in the eye of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was high tech , that was reason enough to write about something else . This , as it turned out , was PGE 's final negotiating position in 1981 , and I retired from the field of battle a few weeks later to watch from a distance as Enron acquired PGE in 1997 and PGE regained its independence in 2006 , after Enron 's collapse . <p> In 2005 , Gregory Nipper , a graduate student at Portland State University , wrote a fine master 's thesis about Trojan , " Progress and Economy : The Clash of Values over Oregon 's Trojan Nuclear Plant . " Nipper 's concluding sentence made good sense to me : <p> The systematic failure of utilities , contractors , regulatory agencies , and government officials to adequately guard the public interest in the case of Trojan is a salient example of the need for extensive and informed popular involvement in decision making in all arenas and at all levels of politics and society  --  especially when the consequences involved the health , security , and well-being of the people and the environment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jeffersonian conclusion with a statement made by PGE 's nuclear information specialist , Bill Babcock , when I told him that if I wrote the Trojan story well , it might provide an important kind of public education : <p> I think it is impossible to inform the public well about nuclear power . It is totally impossible because to inform the public , you 'd have to educate them to a certain level , and I do n't think you can do that . The schools ca n't do it . People will accept nuclear power when they perceive that they understand it . It has nothing to do with really understanding it . It 's the way they perceive they understand what dying in a car accident is like and therefore accept that risk . <p> To Babcock , Lindblad , and the rest of PGE , apparently , having a skeptic tell the story of their nuclear plant was like inviting Ralph Nader to write an inside history of the Ford Motor Company . And although I published fragments of the story in the years that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people at PGE refused to let me talk with their employees at the Trojan plant . And once PGE management decided I was n't their friend , I could only be their enemy , which turned out to be sort of true . But there is a nice irony : the environmentalists who went to court to keep PGE from building the seven additional nuclear plants they were planning in 1973 , two years before the completion of Trojan , may have saved the company from bankruptcy . That is the lesson I take from the story of the Washington Public Power Supply System ( WPPSS ) across the Columbia River from Trojan . WPPSS ( locally pronounced WHOOPS ) had five nuclear plants under construction after 1975 , projects that led to a huge financial collapse and the loss of many millions of dollars , much of it absorbed by taxpayers . <p> It may be that the dangers implicit in nuclear power were intensified within the United States when we went commercial too quickly . Physicist Freeman Dyson , who participated in some of the early research on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that nuclear technology was taken out of the hands of scientists much too quickly and entrusted to accountants and managers . " We are left , " Dyson says , " with a very small number of reactor types , each of them frozen into a huge bureaucratic organization that makes any substantial change impossible , each of them less safe than many possible alternative designs which have been discarded . " The Bush administration has spent $200 million since 2001 on developing designs for the " next generation " of reactors , and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved three new reactor designs . Because of technological improvements such as fiber optics that will replace miles of control cable , all are likely to be safer and cheaper to build than several types now in use . In addition , standardization of design will increase safety , economy , and speed of construction . But the approved designs are still vulnerable to sabotage , and the safe storage of spent fuel is still a problem . <p> Inadequate security has been another result of rushing to wed nuclear power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the impression that nuclear technology is safe . But unlike France , where 75 percent of electricity is generated in nuclear plants and the military is involved in providing security , American power companies rely for protection on private security agencies of varying competence . Attempting to separate commercial nuclear power from nuclear weapons , the Bush administration has taken to speaking of " civilian nuclear power . " In 1957 , with the Price Anderson Act , Congress acknowledged that private insurance companies were unwilling to take on the risk of a nuclear accident . ( Cost estimates for the Chernobyl accident , so far , run over $350 billion . ) Price Anderson provides both liability insurance and limits on nuclear liability . In addition , the Bush administration now offers as incentives to build new nuclear plants $500 million risk insurance for construction delays on the first two plants and $250 million on the next four . <p> The Bush administration is not alone in pushing for more nuclear power plants . Some environmentalists , convinced that climate change is the greatest single danger faced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only source of energy that can support development in poorer countries without contributing to disastrous global warming . The correlation between electricity consumption and improving health , education , and economic prosperity makes this a powerful argument . Although Greenpeace USA , the Sierra Club , the World Wildlife Fund , and other environmental groups continue to press for conservation and renewable energy while opposing nuclear power , the late Hugh Montefiore of Friends of the Earth and Patrick Moore , cofounder of Greenpeace , as well as James Lovelock , whose " Gaia " hypothesis posits Earth as a superorganism , have all made the case for nuclear power . <p> Maybe we have to admit we 've backed ourselves into a corner , and only nuclear power can save civilization . But such a conclusion seems desperate . It imagines " progress " that can only be energy-intensive industrialization and dismisses the increasing inclination among conservationists to strengthen efficient local economies . It takes for granted the end of conservation well before we have learned to protect the earth we " borrowed from our children , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children 's future on a dangerous technology before we have learned the humility and disciplined care nuclear power demands . Imagining the consequences of a rejuvenated commercial nuclear power industry in the United States , I 'd be tempted to pull on those scarlet long johns and start to run  --  if there were anywhere left to go . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Trojan Nuclear Power Plant cooling tower implosion <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The site of the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada , which is scheduled to open in 10 years <p> By William Nichols <p> <p> William Nichols is a visiting professor at Dartmouth .
