On the highways and backroads of the West , there are pie stops worth a special trip , places where culinary kings and queens reign over empires of flaky crusts and luscious fillings .

Chris Martin provides a sweet interlude to a trip across Wyoming . At left : his four-berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed a pet ingredient or technique , but others confessed to the simplest formulas : " Our pie dough is Crisco , flour , and salt , " says Lysa Sangermano , co-owner of Mom 's Pies . " Not real complicated , but when you have a woman who has made pies for 20 years , it becomes second nature . " And therein lies the truth : A good crust is part art , part science . So what 's a beginning pie baker to do ? After putting Sunset 's recipe testers through a battery of formulas and refinements , we settled on two fine crusts you can rely on . One combines butter and shortening for flavor and texture balance . The other relies on lard for exceptional flakiness . Even inexperienced bakers had good luck with both . Sunset 's Favorite Pie Pastry PREP TIME : About 20 minutes // MAKES : 8 servings 1 . In a bowl , mix 1 cup flour and the salt ( for single crust ) or 2 cups flour and the salt ( for double crust ) .

Gently squeeze about 1/4 cup of the dough into a ball ; if it wo n't hold together , crumble lump back into bowl and sprinkle with more water , 1 tablespoon at a time ; stir with a fork until evenly moistened. 3 . With lightly floured hands , gently squeeze dough into a ball . For double crust , divide in half and shape each half into a ball . Pat dough into a smooth 4-inch-wide round ( 2 rounds for double crust ) . Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill until slightly firm , 15 to 30 minutes . 4 . Lay dough ( 1 round for double crust ) on a lightly floured surface . With a floured rolling pin , roll gently and evenly in short strokes from center of dough outward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , push them back toward center to make round relatively smooth . Occasionally slide a long metal spatula under dough and lift , dusting flour beneath to prevent sticking . 5 . Fold the dough round in half , lift it gently without stretching , and lay the folded edge across the middle of a 9  --  inch pie pan . Unfold and ease dough into pan without stretching . With scissors , trim dough edge evenly 3/4 inch beyond pan rim . 6 . For a single-crust pie : Fold dough edge under itself , flush with pan rim . To flute , press down with your thumb and first finger on dough rim to make indentations ; at the same time , press against dough edge with 1 finger of your other hand , pushing it between your fingers on the rim . Repeat indentations side by side around rim . Bake or fill crust as recipe directs . For a double-crust pie : Fill bottom crust as recipe directs .

Trim edge flush with dough in pan . Fold dough edges under , flush with pan rim . Flute as directed for single  --  crust pie . If dough has no cutout , with a small , sharp knife , cut several 2- to 3-inch slits in top pastry to let steam escape . For a lattice-top pie : Fill bottom crust as recipe directs . Roll second ball of dough as described in step 4 , shaping it as close as you can into a 10-inch square . With a knife or fluted cutter , cut dough into 3/4-inch-wide strips . Arrange half the strips over pie filling about 1 inch apart . One at a time , weave remaining strips perpendicular to and over and under every other strip in the first set ( lifting first strips as needed ) into a lattice pattern .
