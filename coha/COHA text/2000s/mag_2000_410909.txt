The trend is popular among celebrities , athletes and every people // DESPITE needling from parents , sports officials and authority figures , celebrities , athletes , and now teens and adults are taking the body-piercing trend to another level . Once associated with punk rockers , bikers and prison inmates , body-piercing is now popular with middle-class adults in all occupations , including some doctors like psychiatrist Walter Shervington , who has a pierced ear . Today , the " art " has gone far beyond the traditional pierced ear lobe . It now includes the piercing of ear cartilage , the tongue , lips , eyebrows , nipples , navel and genitals . Done without anesthesia , the actual piercing is done quickly and then an object such as jewelry is usually inserted into the pierced area . Despite the risky nature of bodypiercing , the trend apparently is here to stay . It 's cheaper ( $25-$125 ) compared to $50 to $2000-plus for tattoos , according to one published report ; it takes less time than tattoos , which can take hours to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as running back Ricky Williams , who has tattoos and his ears pierced , and basketball 's Dennis Rodman , who has numerous body-piercings , have pushed the trend into mainstream culture . Popular entertainers such as Eve , Janet Jackson , Lenny Kravitz , Sisqo and Nokio of Dru Hill , and Cherokee have made piercing socially acceptable to their teen audience who are especially drawn to " body art . " Why do people pierce their bodies ? " There 's a very , very , sexual component to all of piercing , " says Shervington , president of the National Medical Association . While there is the " radical element , there 's also a great deal of sexual expression embedded in the practice-a little bit of the peacock , " he adds . Nokio of Dru Hill seems to agree with the doctor when he says he did it " for the ladies . It 's something about it . It 's sexual .

" Photograph Popularizing the piercing trend are high-profile celebrities , including basketball star Dennis Rodman and ( above ) Janet Jackson , whose nose-piercing was done for " a spiritual reason , " the multitalented entertainer says . // Janet Jackson , Nokio and several other stars have had their chest pierced . " At any given moment of the day ... a lot of it body-piercing can be very sexual , " she said during a guest appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show . She has also had her tongue and nose pierced . Nose-piercing is quite popular with the stars . Other celebrities with nose-piercings include Eve , Lenny Kravitz , Da Brat and Jermaine Dupri . Athletes have made body-piercing much more visible to the public , although most coaches require their players to remove the studs during a game . Kinsley O'Garrow , a senior lacrosse player at George Mason University , has an eyebrow barbell , a tongue stud and seven other piercings . Her coach says she is concerned about her athletes ' safety , but does n't dictate what they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are , " O'Garrow says of the piercings .

" All cultures paint , pierce , tattoo or adorn their bodies , one anthropologist noted , to attract the opposite sex , boost self-esteem , show allegiance to a particular group or set themselves up as apart or different from the group . Egyptian pharaohs brandished their royalty by piercing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced nipples , according to one writer . Africans and American Indians use body-piercing in rites of passage and religious ceremonies . The art of body-piercing , though always controversial , has been around since biblical times . And society 's reaction to it ( mostly horror and revulsion ) has an early precedent as well . in the Bible 's book of Leviticus 19:28 , God tells Moses : " Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you . " However society 's conventions have n't dissuaded the young and the young-at-heart from the piercing parlors . And that concerns physicians and health officials who are seeing an increased incidence of infections and other serious complications , including blood poisoning , arising from bodypiercings ' rising popularity . One in five body-piercings leads to a serious bacterial infection , according to the Harvard Medical School Family Health Guide . In London , at least one emergency-room physician places the number at one in three people developing serious infections following bodypiercing . Piercing also can allow transmission of tetanus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV virus that causes AIDS is also a possibility , but not as great of a risk as hepatitis because HIV dies at room temperature . Less serious local infections can cause illness , deformity and scarring . Both the American and Canadian Red Cross refuse to accept blood donations from anyone who has had bodypiercing ( or a tattoo ) in the previous year due to the risk of hepatitis . Teens are especially vulnerable to infections and complications because they are most likely to try to perform body modification on themselves and each other because they have to have parental consent to get pierced . Because of that fact , teens are likely to use unsterile instruments and share them without proper sterilization between uses . Most piercing parlors require parental consent for body-piercing for customers under the age of 18 . Although the piercing industry as a whole is not heavily regulated for health and safety standards , one organization , the Association of Professional Piercers ( APT ) , based in San Francisco , does certify members who adhere to strict safety and health requirements . Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate body-piercing . Dr. John ( Jack ) Ward , medical liaison for the APP , says the organization does not endorse home-piercing . " People should use reputable places ; check if a shop is a member of the APP , " Ward says . Customers should also check if the shop has a separate area where the piercing is done , that is not exposed to the public , he adds , saying the popularity of piercing has spread to the middle-class . " In fact , I see more people in the 60 to7O-yearold age group choosing to be pierced . " Anyone considering body-piercing should only go to a reputable piercing or tattoo studio or their physician . Photograph Body-pie-ing has become very popular among those in the music industry . Beyonci6 ( second from l. , ) , one of the members of the singing group Destiny 's Child , proudly displays her pierced navel . // In evaluating studios , the Mayo Clinic recommends the following : An autoclave ( heat sterilization machine regulated by the Food and Drug Administration ) on the premises that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instruments and supplies are pre-sterilized and stored in sterile bags . Needles are in sterile packages , used only once and discarded in a biohazard container . Instruments and supplies that can not be autoclaved are disinfected after each use with a commercial disinfectant or bleach solution . A fresh pair of latex gloves is used for each procedure . If the piercer opens drawers or answers the phone while performing procedure , he is not protecting his customers from infection . Jewelry used in piercing is nonallergenic only ( stainless steel 300 series , gold , niobium , titanium , or platinum ) and has n't been previously used or worn or has been autoclaved . " Piercing guns , " which historically have been used in places that strictly do ear-piercing , should not be used for any kind of piercing . These devices typically ca n't be autoclaved , meaning there is a greater risk of infection . Also , by design , these guns make a less precise incision , also raising the risk of infection . Medical personnel agree that there are no body-piercing procedures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the No. 1 medical concern is the possibility of keloids-overgrowth of sear tissue and permanent scarring as a result of piercing the skin , and the second medical item of grave concern is contact dermatitis , an itchy , scaly rash relating to the metals , such as nickel , used in the body-piercing jewelry . " Many people have a nickel allergy which , in some instances has been known to induce asthma , " he adds . Even with scrupulous sterilization procedures and techniques , problems such as pain , bleeding , infection and scarring can occur . The following are some of the more troublesome piercing locations : Tongue and lips . Dentists say that because the mouth contains so much bacteria , oral piercings present a high risk of infection . This is one of the most common sites for piercing . Dentists say a pierced tongue can cause problems with chewing and speech , jewelry can break teeth or be swallowed , increased saliva flow , permanent numbness and loss of taste . Swelling is very common and the site can take up to six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piercing in this area for women may create scar tissue that could inhibit successful breastfeeding . This area can take 4-6 months to heal . Navel . For those with protruding navels ( outies ) , this is a problematic area to pierce . The best candidates are those with internal navels ( innies ) . Because clothing often causes irritations by rubbing against the pierced area , this site often takes longest to heal-up to nine months . Nose . Another very common piercing site , nose-piercing does n't have an unusually high degree of complications and usually heals in three to six months . APP representatives do n't recommend that noses be pierced with piercing guns because the nose area bruises easily . Eyebrow . Growing in popularity , this site poses a problem because of its close proximity to the eye , medical officials say . If an infection develops , it could spread to the eye . Also the skin around the eyes can stretch or droop , causing eyebrow rings to shift . People also tend to fidget and play with the eyebrow ring , introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts say , complete healing of the site can take as long as two years . The wearer should n't handle or touch the pierced site unnecessarily . As a public health precaution , someone with a recent piercing should avoid pools , Jacuzzis and hot tubs because of the risk of bacteria , infections and should clean the site twice daily with a mild antibacterial soap . So when considering the penetrating issue of body-piercing , AfricanAmerican health professionals advise moderation for Blacks . " What we need to have in mind is what works for White people does n't always work for Black people , " Dr. Shervington says . " There 's a psycho-social context in which this becomes significant as well . I do n't know if you 're going to want to go for the secretary 's job or corporate job with everything jangling and when you open your mouth , out pops this big old ball . " Entertainers and athletes are a different issue , he adds . But in the mainstream , body-piercing may just get under the boss ' skin .
