<p> We 're two weeks into the new year  --  about the time that resolve begins to dissolve , especially for those who 've pledged to change their diet . Now is a good time to take a look at your goals and get realistic . <p> For instance , if you 've pledged to " eat healthy " or " lose weight , " you 're going to need to set some smaller , more specific goals , such as " eat smaller portions " and " eat green , " as in green vegetables . <p> No matter what eating plan you are trying to follow , eating more fruits and vegetables is likely a part of it . In fact , a good resolution is to eat five servings of fruits and veggies each day . But I want to focus on green veggies today because they are acceptable on most diets ( even low-carb plans ) and because many in the green family suffer from bad reputations ( usually because of bad preparations ) . <p> You know that green vegetables are good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in nutrients ( especially vitamins A and C ) and fiber . But to many , asparagus is slimy ; broccoli tastes like dirt ; spinach is limp and salad greens are merely something to chew along with the tomatoes , onions , mushrooms , radishes and dressing . Right ? <p> Well sure , if you 've never had broiled asparagus , roasted broccoli or properly prepared spinach . There are a number of preparations for green vegetables that are so simple and delicious you 'll actually want something green every day . <p> Start with asparagus . This quick method also happens to be the best way to enjoy asparagus , in my opinion . Preheat the oven broiler . Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil . Break off the tough ends of the asparagus spears and place on the baking sheet in a single layer . Drizzle with olive oil . Roll the spears around a bit to make sure they are coated in the oil . Broil for about 4 minutes , until the spears are softened and the crowns begin to brown . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Once they are done , sprinkle with kosher salt and a squeeze of lemon juice . You 'll want this at least once a week . <p> Move on to broccoli . Preheat the oven to 400 degrees . Prepare the baking sheet as above . Cut the broccoli into florets , drizzle with olive oil , turning the florets to make sure they are lightly coated . Roast in the oven for 20-30 minutes , or until the edges of the florets begin to brown . ( If you 'd like , mix the broccoli with cauliflower . ) Sprinkle with salt to taste and enjoy . No messy , heavy cheese sauce required . <p> Spinach , I admit , can be tricky . It 's excellent raw , of course , as a part of salad mix . And it mixes well into a number of other dishes , from dip to meatballs . But one moment too long in the steamer or saute pan , and it 's slime city as a side dish . Try this method . De-stem and rinse a bunch of spinach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a deep saute pan . Cover and cook over high heat for 1 minute . Turn the heat off but leave the lid on for another minute . It 's ready to serve . You may want to sprinkle with salt or lemon juice or drizzle lightly with olive oil ( or do all three ) . <p> Essentially the same method can be used to braise a mixture of greens , including kale , chard , escarole , frisee , spinach and radicchio . Georgeanne Brennan , author of " Great Greens " ( Chronicle Books , $19.95 ) , recommends working with 2 pounds of young , tender greens . ( More mature greens will work , too , but you should remove the ribs . ) Separate the leaves from the heads if necessary and put them in a bowl of cold water . <p> Heat a large skillet or saute pan over medium heat and put the greens , undried and dripping with water , in the pan . Reduce the heat to medium-low , cover and cook for about 2 minutes . Uncover the pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be liquid in the pan . If not , add 1/2 cup water . Cover and continue to cook until the greens are thoroughly wilted but still bright and colorful , about 6 minutes . Pour off any liquid and add 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil , 1 clove of garlic grated or minced and salt to taste . Increase heat to medium-high , stirring to coat the greens with the oil . Cook off excess liquid and then add the juice of one lemon , which will sizzle . Transfer greens to serving dish and serve immediately . <p> There are a number of other ways to enjoy greens , of course . Arugula mixes well into pasta dishes . Many greens , such as endive , cabbage and even spinach , are nice as gratins . Mixing lettuces and greens gives salads more variety . And you can always stuff chicken breasts or pork tenderloins with greens , such as this recipe ( below ) , also from Brennan 's " Great Greens . " <p> MAIN DISH : Pork Tenderloin Stuffed With Chard and Mushrooms <p> Makes 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 40 minutes <p> 1 to 2 pork tenderloins , about 1 1/2 pounds total , butterflied and pounded to about 3/4-inch thickness <p> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt , divided <p> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper , divided <p> 2 tablespoons , plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil <p> 1 shallot , minced <p> 2 ounces cleaned and roughly chopped shiitake or morel mushrooms ( about 1 cup ) <p> 1 bunch chard <p> 2 cups water <p> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter <p> 1 cup dry white wine <p> Preheat oven to 350 degrees .

In a saucepan , over high heat , bring the water to a boil and add 1/2 teaspoon salt . Add the chard and cook for 1-2 minutes and then drain in a colander . When the chard is cool enough to handle , chop it and squeeze out excess liquid . Add the chard to the bowl with the mushrooms and stir to combine . Spread the mixture along two-thirds of the tenderloin in an even layer . Working from the edge with the filling , roll the tenderloin toward the unfilled edge .
