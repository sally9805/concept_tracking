<p> Drive past the Home Depot and Hell 's Point Golf Club , where Ryan Zimmerman worked as a cart boy , cleaning up the balls from the range , and follow the beach grass to the edge of the ocean . Take a right at Sandbridge Market , and head toward the spot where the new condos are scheduled to go up , creating still more traffic on this windblown sliver of beach where Keith and Cheryl Zimmerman bought a fixer-upper on stilts more than a dozen years ago , where they raised their two boys , and where the long line of major league scouts who trekked this way would frequently ask , " Where do you play baseball around here , anyway ? " <p> Never mind that Keith Zimmerman laughs a bit when he says , " This house is a work in progress . " It is home and it feels like it , as evidenced by the surfboard Ryan has stashed on the porch , by the black baseball bats he can pull from his room , by the stories he tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast , a beach kid at home above the sand . It is where the living room is adorned with a few photos of Ryan and his younger brother , Shawn , and also with maritime artifacts , a model lighthouse and a portrait of a seagull taking flight . <p> " I love it , " Ryan said . " That 's where I 'm comfortable . " <p> The truth is , Ryan Zimmerman looks comfortable just about anywhere . It might be in the kitchen of his boyhood home , a hot dog in his hand , his parents a few feet away in the living room . It might be on the green grass of a major league infield , where he made his debut for the Washington Nationals last September , where he will play as the team 's starting third baseman this season , just a year after he was selected with the fourth pick in the draft out of the University of Virginia . He can do this at age 21 because according to Brian O'Connor , his coach at Virginia , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , that 's what really makes him . " <p> The humility withstood the constant questions that came last summer , questions about when he would be called up to the majors even though he was just 20 , even though he spent less than two months in the minors , even though he began his stint with Class AA Harrisburg by embarking on the only prolonged slump of , well , of his life . The humility withstood the accolades Nationals General Manager Jim Bowden doled out after he was drafted , saying Zimmerman had defensive ability comparable to the all-time greats at third base , to Brooks Robinson and Mike Schmidt and Scott Rolen , 32 Gold Gloves among them . <p> " I do n't really stress about too much , " Zimmerman said last week , standing in his kitchen , that half-eaten hot dog on the counter in front of him . " I 've never been a worrier or anything like that . " <p> The humility , it turns out , grew in the small rooms of the weathered gray house that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandbridge section of Virginia Beach and the Massachusetts island Nantucket , where some of Cheryl 's family used to gather . It is where Ryan and Shawn Zimmerman learned to manage tasks other kids did n't need to manage , learned to appreciate things others assume they 'll always have . <p> " I think a lot of his attitude comes from just , unfortunately , they have had a little bit more dose of reality than most junior high and high school kids have had , " Keith Zimmerman said . " He sees the whole picture of what goes on a little bit better than your typical kid had to see it . I do n't know if that was fair or right or wrong , but that 's the way it was . " <p> Cheryl Zimmerman agreed . She is in a wheelchair , and has been since 2000 . In 1995 , she discovered she had multiple sclerosis , a chronic , unpredictable disease that affects the central nervous system . She continued to work as an elementary special education teacher , and for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MS affects roughly 400,000 Americans , and it can impact the body in almost that many different ways . There 's no way to tell how the disease will take hold of a given person . " You could be blind the next day , " Keith said , " or you could go 25 years with absolutely no change . " <p> The change for Cheryl Zimmerman , and the change for her whole family , really came in 1998 , when she was out on a personal watercraft just off the coast of Sandbridge . Ryan and Shawn , just 13 and 10 at the time , were motoring off ahead . Cheryl rode with a family friend . And before she knew it , the friend 's husband had slammed into them from behind . <p> " I looked back , and seeing them stopped , I figured something was wrong , " Ryan said . " I went back , and it was scary . " <p> Cheryl , though , did n't act worried . " I think it 's because me and my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for concern . She broke the L2 vertebra in her back . For someone with MS , such a blow can be devastating . " Anytime you throw in a major operation or a major injury like a Jet Ski accident , " Keith said , " that speeds up the whole process as far as the disease goes . " <p> Cheryl used to run , but those days were over . A lacrosse player in college , she came from an athletic family in her home town of Collegeville , Pa. , where she grew up with Keith . She served as an assistant coach on Ryan 's youth basketball teams and was part of the two-person operation that toted the Zimmerman boys to and from practices and games and , in Shawn 's case , golf matches . <p> If the diagnosis of MS started to change all that , then the accident blew it up . Cheryl fought to continue teaching , returning in January 1999 and working through the next school year . " Finally I said : ' That 's it . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school was a long way from the parking lot . Just getting there had become a challenge . And the disease was progressing . She went to the wheelchair full time . Now she has use of her arms , and her hands a little bit . She can talk and eat without any problem . " But I 'm basically dead weight from my armpits down , " she said . <p> So the reality of day-to-day life at Sandtucket changed . Cheryl could no longer make dinner , so Ryan and Shawn were expected to chip in . They learned to do their own laundry . The family installed a ramp at one end of the house so Cheryl could wheel down to the driveway , where a lift would raise her into the family van . Now she envisions power doors , because maneuvering around the little house is cumbersome in her chair . <p> " We kind of got eased into it , " Ryan said . " When it first happened , it was n't that bad for a while . But as things progressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted . In a way , that 's helped us out a lot . It made us grow up quicker , a lot more than other kids , kids who had their mom there doing dinner all the time or driving them places or whatever . It made us mature a lot faster . " <p> Truth be told , Ryan Zimmerman may have turned out exactly as he is had his mother been running , been cooking , been working like she always did . " He 's never been a flashy kid , " Keith said . But those who know him believe there is a calm in Ryan that comes out more easily because of his mother 's illness . <p> Take those times in college when the Cavaliers would fall down by three or four runs early in a crucial ACC game . <p> " Kids would come in the dugout , and they 'd be uptight , " O'Connor said . " Ryan always had this presence about him to where he never panicked . Time upon time , you 'd hear him say stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Relax . Just play the game . It 's the third inning . ' It really rubbed off on his teammates . " <p> Meantime , he was doing things his teammates could n't do , making plays others could n't make . In the summer of 2003 , he played in a local college wood-bat league . Greg Lovelady , a former star catcher at the University of Miami , served as the coach , and he watched Zimmerman snare a one-hop smash to his backhand side , jump in the air and " with ease , " Lovelady said , " flick the ball across the diamond . " Lovelady turned to his team . " You see that on ' SportsCenter , ' " he said . " You 're talking about Scott Rolen as the only guy in the majors who can make that play , and he makes it in front of your eyes when he 's 18 . " <p> These comparisons would seem to be exaggerations . Scott Rolen ? Brooks Robinson ? Last week , O'Connor was preparing for an upcoming Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the keynote speaker . The Hall of Famer sent a videotape of highlights that will run as he is introduced . <p> " I thought I was watching Ryan Zimmerman , " O'Connor said . " The ball you come in on , the one Brooks made look so easy ? That 's what Ryan does . " <p> Bounce these comparisons off Zimmerman , and he allows that it 's " neat . " But the fact that he does n't treat it as a big deal is one of the reasons his teammates and others in the Nationals organization are predicting a smooth transition to a full-time job in the majors . He hit .397 with 10 doubles in just 58 at-bats at the tail end of last season and made enough of an impression that the Nationals traded veteran Vinny Castilla to make room for him . " Poised , " is how first baseman Nick Johnson described Zimmerman after he had been in the majors a few weeks . <p> " Honestly , " said Nationals catcher Brian Schneider , " he 's the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how good he can be . " <p> How good he can be is the result of natural ability , no doubt . But no one who knows Zimmerman debates that his circumstances play into his attitude . He is low-key about his success in part because his mother is low-key about her disease . " You either go with it , " Cheryl said , before Keith jumped in . " You just do n't let it consume you , " he said . <p> Last week , as the sun set across the beach and the low light shined through the windows of the house , Ryan Zimmerman moved easily through his living room , joking with his parents about old moments in high school , or how his widespread family might embarrass him when they showed up at various games , sometimes sticking their heads in the dugout to see if they could catch a word with Ryan . Cheryl , sitting in stocking feet in her wheelchair , smiled at each retelling , rolling her eyes and laughing . <p> " She does n't let that bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want anyone to act any different when she 's there . How can that not have an effect on you ? "
