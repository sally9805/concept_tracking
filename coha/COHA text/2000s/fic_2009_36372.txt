The first thing Ryan found was a hand with part of an arm . He guessed it was the left hand , but it was hard to tell . He spotted the right foot on the other side of the kitchen , on the floor , next to the high chair . <p> God only knew where the missing eyes and ears were . <p> Living in Pawtucket , Rhode Island , birthplace of Mr. Potato Head , had its ups and downs . But this working-class city of seventy-two thousand on the Blackstone River was no one-spud wonder . It was also the minor-league home of one of the most storied teams in baseball . <p> " Hi , Dada , " said Ainsley . She was wearing only a diaper and her baseball cap  --  her daddy 's team , of course . The Pawtucket Red Sox  --  " PawSox "  --  were the Triple-A minor-league affiliate of the Boston Red Sox , and twenty-four-year-old Ryan James was their rising star . Ryan put his daughter 's partially reconstructed toy aside and gathered up Ainsley in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast ? " asked Ryan , as he put her in the high chair . <p> " Mama , " she said . <p> " Anything else ? " <p> " Dada . " <p> " Coming right up , " said Ryan . <p> Ainsley had fewer words in her vocabulary than most two-year-olds , and anything that she could n't say was either a mama or a dada . Ryan did n't want to get Freudian about the whole thing , but he assumed the dada was a banana . He had no idea what the mama was . He selected a ripe one from the bunch , sliced it up for her , and put the pieces on the tray . <p> " Here you go , gorgeous , " he said . <p> Ainsley ate one bite , then took the biggest piece and threw it right over Ryan 's head . It landed in front of the refrigerator , where the real mama had to duck out of the line of fire as she entered the kitchen . <p> Chelsea sighed and put her hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . " <p> " I think you meant Ainsley , " he said . <p> " What ? " <p> " You said , ' Ryan , please do n't throw food . ' I swear it was n't me . " <p> Chelsea looked flummoxed . " Oh , God . I 'm already stressed . " <p> " Just wait till we have five of these bambinos- . " Chelsea froze . <p> " Kidding , " said Ryan . He wanted only four . Chelsea poured a quick cup of coffee and gulped half of it down . " Why are you so tense ? " said Ryan . She coughed on her java , and he immediately regretted the question . As a minor-league player , Ryan made the standard eleven hundred dollars per month plus a twenty-dollar per diem food allowance . It was n't enough . Chelsea supplemented their income by teaching third-grade English at one of Boston 's prestigious private schools . Three nights a week she attended law school classes at Suffolk University in Boston , a four-year program that would earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Ryan made it to the majors , she 'd keep teaching ; if he did n't , she 'd start a new career . Either way , money would no longer be such an overriding issue in their future . For now , however , finances were tight , and with her full-time teaching responsibilities , her part-time law studies , and an hour-long commute each way between Pawtucket and Boston , Chelsea was struggling to be the good wife and mother . <p> Chelsea said , " I have a very important meeting , first thing this morning , with Mrs. Chambers . The last person I want to keep waiting is the head of school . " <p> " You should eat something . It 'll settle your nerves . " <p> " No time . " <p> " At least take a dada for the road , " he said , holding up another banana . <p> The Ainsleyism brought a smile . <p> " Okay , " she said . " I 'll have a dada . " <p> She went to him and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to cut the stress . That was the great thing about marrying the love of your life . People sometimes said , " I ca n't live without you " without a thought , but when Ryan said those words to Chelsea , he was quite literal . Teammates teased him for being whipped , but deep down they envied him . <p> " Me , me , me ! " said Ainsley . <p> Chelsea gave her a kiss , too . <p> " Ainsley has speech therapy today at eleven , " she said . " Can you pick her up from day care and take her ? " <p> " Sure , " Ryan said . " Batting practice does n't start until three . I 'll take her to your mother 's afterward . " <p> " And I 'll get her from there . " <p> " Then you 're coming to the game tonight ? " <p> There was a long pause . Chelsea 's schedule had n't allowed her to see many of Ryan 's games this season . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Honey , it 's the last game of the season . " <p> " I know . But the semester has barely started , and I 'm already getting into trouble for missing too many classes . " <p> " Do n't they let you make up the class work for family commitments ? Just this one time ? " <p> " Well , I guess I could call the professor and see what he says . " <p> " So you 'll come ? " <p> " I will really , really try . " <p> Ryan took an envelope from the kitchen counter and handed it to her . " I snagged you really great seats . " <p> She hesitated , and Ryan could see that he was adding pressure that she did n't need today . But it truly was the biggest game of the season . <p> Chelsea looked inside the envelope . " There are only two tickets , " she said . <p> " Yeah . One for you and one for Ainsley . " <p> " What about Babes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Babes was the nickname for Chelsea 's younger brother , Daniel . Twenty-one years old and still living with his parents , he suffered from Asperger 's syndrome , an autism-related disorder . He loved baseball and rarely missed a PawSox game . Most of the players were kind to him , but it was a bad practical joke a few years ago that had brought Ryan and Chelsea together . For laughs , one of Ryan 's teammates asked Babes if he wanted a chocolate bar , but it was really Ex-Lax . Around the seventh inning , poor Babes suddenly dropped his baseball mitt and cap and went running home from the stands , a grown man with a load in his pants . Ryan got a three-game suspension without pay for breaking the nose of the jackass who 'd done it . When Babes 's sister came to thank Ryan , the sparks started to fly . <p> <br> Continues ...
