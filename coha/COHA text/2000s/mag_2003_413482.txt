Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Q My four-year-old son is going through a personality change . He used to be very shy and would n't talk to anybody , but lately he 's developed a tendency to act " goofy " and do things that irritate his friends , such as trying to pick them up , getting in their faces and grabbing at their clothes . It 's clear to me that he 's very unsure of himself and is simply trying to engage them , but he ends up just annoying them . How can I help him ? A Many naturally shy people develop a persona designed to mask or compensate for their shyness . I think you 're right in suggesting that your son is acting " goofy " to engage his playmates and that he is struggling . He is only four , however , and his attempts are very new . He 'll need lots of practice and experience , lots of failure before he sorts out a comfortable way of being with his friends .

Although it is painful to watch , it 's probably better to stay on the sidelines unless he asks for help . It 's much more damaging to a child 's self-esteem when mom or dad find him irritating than when other kids do  --  at least at this stage . When you are with him , keep reminding him that you love him as he is and that he does n't have to try to be funny to make you smile . JM Q My husband and I are separated . He takes our kids ( 18 months and four years old ) on weekends and , without fail , every time they return not having had naps or proper sleep at night . They 're exhausted and cranky , and it takes two days before they 're back to normal . I do n't want to prevent them from seeing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better care of them ? A I can see how this could become a particular bone of contention . If your children 's father has the kids only on weekends , it can be tough to interrupt precious hours of fun to enforce rules about chores and bedtimes or anything else . Meanwhile , you 're understandably frustrated having to deal with tired and irritable kids . I 've found that fathers are generally more willing to address this kind of problem when they have a co-operative rather than competitive relationship with their ex-wives . Try joining forces to combat the issue ; make him your ally . If you can find a way to compliment him for all the positive things he does with the kids , and not scold him like an incompetent babysitter , even better . If face-to-face communication is strained , try sending a note each weekend , or communicate through e-mail . That said , it 's worth it to establish a working relationship now , as you 're going to have to share child-care responsibilities for many years to come . JM Q My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now obsessing about our eight-year-old daughter 's . How can I protect my child from developing a poor body image ? A At eight years old , your child is still growing and developing . She needs to eat nutritious meals and be physically active . It sounds as though your wife is trying to help your daughter avoid whatever discomfort she felt growing up , but being obsessive about it wo n't help . I would start by visiting your family doctor who can reassure your wife that your daughter is just fine . If your wife ca n't get past her obsession , consider counselling . A counsellor might help you and your wife communicate with each other about your daughter 's size , and could determine whether your wife needs individual help . Want to read more ?

She 's going into a much bigger school and is scared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she wo n't make any friends and that the work will be too hard . We 've endured many crying fits already , and she has n't even started . Help ! A Start by talking to one of her new teachers or a school counsellor for some advice ; they 've likely dealt with this before . If your daughter has n't had a tour of the school , try to arrange one . Some schools have buddy systems for new students ; check to see if her new school has such a program . She should try to go with a friend from her previous school , so she has some support . Be empathetic but matter-of-fact when she heads off on the first day . Let her know that you understand it is frightening but that you have faith in her ability to cope . You may also want to investigate further why she 's so afraid . Are some kids teasing her about high school ? Have older kids inadvertently told her negative stories about high school ? While it 's normal for any child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're describing here is more than typical nerves . If this fear continues , have her talk to a therapist to try and get to the bottom of it . KL Q My two-year-old son has had chronic ear infections since he was eight months old . He has tubes in both ears , yet continues to get ear infections  --  sometimes only weeks apart . He does not go swimming and has custom-made earplugs , which remain firmly in place when he has a bath . The ENT specialist says I must have gotten his ears wet  --  which I 'm convinced is not the case . What can I do ? A The sheer volume of material written about ear infections should tell you we do n't have all the answers . I am certain your son 's plugs are protective enough in the bath . Here are a few suggestions to add to the list of precautions you 're probably already taking to prevent your son 's ears from getting infected . Make sure no one around him smokes . Also , check that he 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relatively new pneumococcal meningitis inoculation , Prevnar , as it 's known to have a slight effect on reducing ear infections . Does your son have other frequent infections , especially of the skin ? If so , he may need his immune system checked . A final word of advice : If some of these ear infections are mild , and your son 's in good spirits with just a low-grade fever , try not to give him antibiotics . One of the greatest risks from his infections after hearing/speech complications and secondary infections , may be his increased resistance to antibiotics . Good luck , and do n't stop bathing him ! DS Q Can you tell me what body temperature is normal , and what is considered low ? And what does it mean if your child 's temperature is below normal ? A A child 's body temperature varies much more than that of an adult . Generally the range is 36Symbol Not Transcribed degreeC to 37.5Symbol Not Transcribed degreeC ( 98.6Symbol Not Transcribed degreeF to 99.5Symbol Not Transcribed degreeF ) . Body temperature is highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the night . If a child is healthy , a temperature a degree or so lower than the normal range is not a concern . And while we 're on this topic , here 's something to keep in mind if your child is running a fever : A high temperature is often related to infection , yet rarely related to the seriousness of an infection . Mild infections can lead to high fevers in some children . A much more important sign of the seriousness of infection is the child 's energy level . DS <p>
