Children of the Storm Chapter One The encrimsoned sun sank slowly toward the crest of the Theban mountains . Another glorious Egyptian sunset burned against the horizon like fire in the heavens . In fact , I did not at that moment behold it , since I was facing east . I had seen hundreds of sunsets , however , and my excellent imagination supplied a suitable mental picture . As the sky over Luxor darkened , the shadows of the bars covering doors and windows lengthened and blurred , lying like a tiger 's stripes across the two forms squatting on the floor . One of them said , " Spoceeva . " " Russian , " Ramses muttered . scribbling on his notepad . " Yesterday it was Amharic . The day before it sounded like  --  " " Gibberish , " said his wife . " No , " Ramses insisted . " It has to mean something . They use root words from a dozen languages , and they obviously understand one another . See ? He 's nodding . They are standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leave the cat alone ! " The Great Cat of Re , stretched out along the back of the settee behind him , rose in haste and climbed to the top of his head , from which position it launched itself onto a shelf . Ramses put his notepad aside and looked severely at the two figures who stood before him . " Die Katze ist ganz verboten . Kedi , hayir . Em nedjeroo pa meeoo . " The Great Cat of Re grumbled in agreement . He had been a small , miserable-looking kitten when we acquired him , but Sennia had insisted on giving him that resounding appellation and , against all my expectations , he had grown into his name . His appearance was quite different from those of our other cats : longhaired , with an enormous plume of a tail , and a coat of spotted black on gray . With characteristic feline obstinacy he insisted on joining us for tea , though he knew he would have to go to some lengths to elude his juvenile admirers , who now burst into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Darling , let 's stick to one language , shall we ? " Nefret said . She was smiling , but I thought there was a certain edge to her voice . " They 'll never learn to talk if you address them in ancient Egyptian and Anglo-Saxon . " " They know how to talk , " Ramses said loudly , over the duet . " Recognizable human speech , however  --  " " Say Papa , " Nefret coaxed . She leaned forward . " Say it for Mama . " " Bap , " said the one whose eyes were the same shade of cornflower-blue . " Perverse little beggars , " said Ramses . The other child climbed onto his knee and buried her head against his chest . I suspected she was trying to get closer to the cat , but she made an engaging picture as she clung to her father . They were affectionate little creatures , much given to hugging and kissing , especially of each other . " They 're over two years old , " Ramses went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking plainly long before that , was n't I , Mother ? " " Dear me , yes , " I said , with a somewhat sickly smile . To be honest  --  which I always endeavor to be in the pages of my private journal  --  I dreaded the moment when the twins began to articulate . Once Ramses learned to talk plainly , he never stopped talking except to eat or sleep , for over fifteen years , and the prolixity and pedantry of his speech patterns were extremely trying to my nerves . The idea of not one but two children following in the paternal footsteps chilled my blood . Ever the optimist , I told myself there was no reason to anticipate such a disaster . The little dears might take after their mother , or me . " Children learn at different rates , " I explained to my son . " And twins , according to the best authorities , are sometimes slower to speak because they communicate readily with one another . " " And because they get everything they want without having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously understood English , though they declined to speak it ; his little daughter raised her head and fluttered her long lashes flirtatiously . He fluttered his lashes back at her . Charla giggled and gave him a hug . The question of suitable names had occupied us for months . I say " us , " because I saw no reason why I should not offer a suggestion or two . ( There is nothing wrong with making suggestions so long as the persons to whom they are offered are not obliged to accept them . ) Not until the end of her pregnancy did I begin to suspect Nefret was carrying twins , but since we had already settled on names for a male or a female child , it worked out quite nicely . There was no debate about David John ; no one quarreled with Ramses 's desire to name his son after his best friend and his cousin who had died in France in 1915 . A girl 's name was not so easy to find . Emerson declared ( quite without malice , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already enough Amelias in the family . It was with some hesitation that I mentioned that my mother 's name had been Charlotte , and I was secretly pleased when Nefret approved . " It is such a nice , ordinary name , " she said . " Unlike Nefret , " said her husband . " Or Ramses . " She chuckled and patted his cheek . " Not that you could ever be anything else . " Charla , as we called her , had the same curly black hair and dark eyes as her father . Her brother Davy , now perched on his mother 's knee , was fair , with Nefret 's blue eyes and Ramses 's prominent nose and chin . They did not resemble each other except in height , and in their linguistic eccentricity . Davy was more easygoing than his sister , but he had a well-nigh supernatural ability to disappear from one spot and materialize in another some distance away . The bars had been installed in all the rooms they were wont to inhabit , including the veranda , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
