Section : Science &; Technology It 's survival of the fittest online , though the clever and quirky can tough it out <p> During the week of September 11 , the Web returned to its roots as a virtual commune . The network ferried billions of E-mails and instant messages from folks eager to be in digital touch , as phones were dicey , at best , in New York and Washington , D.C. , in the wake of the attacks . IMs on AOL Time Warner 's network spiked to a record 1.2 billion on the 11th ; America Online chat-room users soared to 3 million , as strangers sought solace by sharing rage , fear , and sadness . And information flowed freely on most news sites , as many stripped ads to accommodate huge demand ; ABCNEWS.com 's traffic leapt over 600 percent that Tuesday and is still double its rate before the attacks . <p> While recent events show the Web 's potential to democratize communication , in the past year and a half its promise to do the same for media and commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 2000 , and countless smaller sites have collapsed without notice . Far from flitting among thousands of sites in a utopian dot-com landscape , Web users in March 2001 spent half their time on sites owned by just four firms : AOL Time Warner , Microsoft , Yahoo ! , and the now defunct free Napster . The Web today is " primarily left to the blue-chip firms who do the advertising and the distribution deals , and so end up commanding a much larger proportion of users ' time , " says Mark Mooradian , a senior analyst at Jupiter Media Metrix , which published the study . <p> Money talks . In some ways the dot-com crash was a good and predictable thing . Every new technology  --  remember radio and TV ?  --  has spawned a gaggle of entrepreneurs hoping to cash in . And some fallout is inevitable . When a swath of pet-food sites spring up , " anybody with good business sense realizes that unless the demand for pet food suddenly goes up , the market ca n't support all those players , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Become a Successful E-commerce Merchant . <p> Web survivors share several traits . Many boast solid business fundamentals  --  like profits  --  and truly make life easier . " Overall , " says Broadhead , " the sites that last are the sites that provide value . " Online grocer Webvan flopped while leaner rival Peapod is still saving customers in seven areas the hassle of grocery-store lines . EBay , perhaps the Web 's biggest success story , created a kind of commerce that simply could not exist offline . And customers of JoeAuto.com ease the process of car repair by making appointments online and peeking at their cars ' progress  --  monitored by webcams  --  on their PCs . <p> Undeniably , firms with a real-world presence , along with financial resources , won big . Mall favorite Toys " R " Us weathered a debilitating 1999 Christmas season , while Web-only rival eToys folded . Some deep-pocketed Web firms survived by scooping up the competition : AOL 's acquisition of Time Warner is the flashiest of such deals , but others  --  like job site Monster.com 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Rob Enderle , a research fellow at Giga Information Group , " tends to win . " <p> Selling stuff . Once real-world retailers saw the Web would n't put them out of business , many quickly began using it as another sales and marketing tool . Office-supply store Staples not only maintains a Web site but outfits each of over 1,000 stores with Web kiosks . Shoppers searching for a specific binder can check the kiosk , which displays some 50,000 items in all , compared with the 8,000 a typical store stocks . The lesson for businesses ? More ways to shop often mean more money spent . " When shoppers use all three of our channels , " says StaplesDirect.com President Jeanne Lewis of the firm 's small-business , catalog , and Web units , " their sales are 4.5 times what they are if they were to just shop one channel . " <p> But corporations are n't the Web 's only beneficiaries . Satire mag the Onion ( a recent headline claimed , " Hugging Up 76,000 Percent " since the attacks ) gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped the once obscure pub gain a fame that eight years in print alone never did . <p> So , whither the Web ? In a few years , many experts predict , the current ruling troika  --  AOL Time Warner , Microsoft , and Yahoo !  --  will still be intact . Each will own a " walled garden , " a bevy of sites giving users access to most of the Web 's goodies . Though users will be hard pressed to find an independent site , " the majority of folks will probably live and be happy within the space of one of these , " as less choice also means fewer decisions , says Giga 's Enderle . <p> Not that the Web will likely lose its quirkiness entirely . " By far the biggest use of the Internet is E-mail , " says Hal Varian , dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California-Berkeley . " And that 's very idiosyncratic content  --  even if it 's just Honey , pick up a quart of milk on your way home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans seem a small price to pay , as long as the milk gets picked up . 20 with plenty <p> August 's top sites in daily hits , according to Jupiter Media Metrix .
