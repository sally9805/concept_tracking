He loved to watch fat women dance . I guess O'Connor 's last night on the planet was a happy one because that night he had an eyeful of the full-figured . We had gone out that Saturday night for a drink at Banyon 's , and somehow an honest-to-God bevy of bulging beauties had ended up in the same place . O'Connor never got up and danced with any of these women himself ; I 'm not sure he really would have enjoyed being the dancer as much as he did just watching them swing and sway with amazing grace . I do n't think he heard a word I said all evening , which is just as well , since I was only grousing on a well-worn set of subjects . He just sat there , with an expression crossbred between reverence and desire , whenever some big old gal got up to shake and shimmy . O'Connor and I had managed to remain friends through one of the ugliest divorces in the state of California  --  the divorce of his son , Kenny , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their romance started and we both thought it was doomed from the word go . My sister has been a glutton for lousy relationships for years , so no surprise there . But I 'm still mystified about how a great-hearted guy like O'Connor could have had anything to do with the gene pool of a nasty little bastard like Kenny . My guess was that O'Connor 's ex-wife was a real harpy , even though he never talked about her to me . Barbara told me they had split up when Kenny was a baby . Kenny had lived with his mother until he was fourteen , at which time she had packed him up like worn-out clothing and sent him to live with O'Connor  --  no note , no warning , just a call saying the kid was coming in on a flightfrom Phoenix that afternoon . She had taken off for parts unknown  --  no one had heard from her for years afterward . The dancing ladies called it a night , and we decided to do the same . As I drove him home , he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few too many . The jokes were old , but O'Connor could make me laugh just by laughing this ridiculous laugh of his . It started as a kind of noiseless shaking , then guffawing , on to tears , and he ended by taking out his handkerchief and blowing his big nose . I could never watch this performance with a straight face  --  by the time the handkerchief came out , I was a goner . Kenny 's red Corvette was parked in the driveway , so I pulled up at the curb . O'Connor climbed slowly out of the car . " You 're dear to me , Irene , " he said with a wink and little drunken bow . " O'Connor , please do n't sing it . It 's one o'clock in the morning . People are trying to sleep . " I should have known better ; he was going to sing it anyway , and my plea only made him relish doing so all the more . He laughed as he turned and took his bearings on the front door , heaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to belt out " Goodnight , Irene " at the top of his lungs as he shambled up to the darkened house . This was old hat to me and his neighbors , but next door Mrs. Keene felt honor-bound to turn on her porch light to register annoyance . O'Connor grinned and went on in , waving as he closed the door . The morning after our night at Banyon 's , somebody left a package on O'Connor 's front porch . Mrs. Keene was out watering her lawn and later she said she saw him come padding out in his bare feet and bathrobe to pick up the paper . He was a little hung over , I guess , because she said that he did n't see the package until the return trip . She was a little embarrassed to see him in his robe , so she did n't call out a " good morning " or anything , but she 's a nosy bird and she was curious about the package . Nobody knows exactly what happened after that , except that the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of O'Connor just about everywhere they could go . I was at home , having a lazy morning , hanging around in an old pair of pj 's and reading the paper with the supervision of my big gray tomcat , Wild Bill Cody , when the phone rang . It was Lydia Ames , an old pal of mine over at the newspaper where I used to work , the Las Piernas News Express . " Irene ! Does O'Connor live on Randall Avenue ? " " Who wants to know ? " I asked , wary of her tone . " Shit , Irene ! " Now Lydia has only cussed one other time in her life that I know of , and that was when Alicia Penderson showed up at our high school prom in a gown identical to Lydia 's  --  a strapless affair , only on Alicia it seemed to be working harder to defy gravity . So all of a sudden here 's Lydia on a Sunday morning , talking blue and sounding like she was about to cry . I told her O'Connor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , or so it seemed , but I guess it was really about half a minute . " Lydia , what the hell is going on ? " " Shit , Irene ... " Now she was crying . " Irene , I think you better get over to O'Connor 's place . We just got a report that there 's been some kind of explosion  --  Baker 's on his way to cover it . " The whole time I was getting dressed and driving over to O'Connor 's , I kept telling myself that Lydia was pretty hysterical and that I did n't really know that anything had happened to O'Connor . Maybe just his house , maybe not O'Connor but someone else , maybe some other house . That all started to change when I saw the rising smoke from half a mile away . A slow , cold numbing started in my throat and eventually froze me in place on the sidewalk across the street from his house . Clusters of firemen formed tense huddles with cops . The place was surrounded by fire trucks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance . The house was smashed as if it were nothing more than an egg ; a yolk of mud and debris was spilling out of its broken shell . I wanted to find O'Connor . I felt certain that if they would just let me look , just let someone who had cared about him look , I 'd find him . I sometimes hear about people knowing right away that someone they loved has died , that they feel the dead person 's spirit leave or something . O'Connor stuck around . I heard someone yell " Kelly ! " and turned to see a tall black man walking toward me . It was Mark Baker , the reporter sent out by the Express . " Oh , God , Irene , I 'm so sorry , " he said in a shaky voice . I was n't ready for sympathy , and looked away . He understood and stopped talking , just put one of his burly arms around my shoulders and guided me away from the crowd . Mark took me over to where Frank Harriman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then left to talk to one of the guys from the bomb squad . Frank and I had met when he was a rookie cop in Bakersfield and I was on my first crime beat as a fledgling reporter . Now he was a homicide detective with the Las Piernas Police Department . I had n't seen him for a long time , since before I quit the paper , but this was n't the time to renew old acquaintances . As I stood to one side , Frank noticed me and gave me one of those very protective " are-you-okay ? " looks . I tried to avoid his eyes , and turned away from him , but to my horror looked up to see a coroner 's assistant bagging a little piece of something soft . Thank God I 'm not a fainter . I must have looked bad , though , because Frank took me gently by the elbow and said , " Go home , Irene . " I just stared at him . " You still live in the same place ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was also busy with a tug-of-war  --  one minute I was trying to take it all in , the next , trying to shut it all out . I heard Frank say something about wanting to ask me some questions , later . I figured Mrs. Keene had told him about the previous night 's serenade , but I was past caring . I heard the camera shutters of the forensic team , and out of the corner of my eye kept seeing the coroner 's assistants with their goddamned plastic bags and forceps . I felt sick and weird ... disconnected . Frank was quiet for a minute ; then he asked a cop to drive me home , but I shook it off and told him I could manage . I made sure he had my address , then left . I could feel him watching me as I walked to my car . I did n't look back at Frank or the house as I drove off . As I rounded the corner I saw Kenny 's red Corvette heading toward the house . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't equipped for everyday life , let alone something like this . And for the two-millionth time , I knew I could n't do anything about it . It was a long time before I asked myself what had made Kenny get up and at ' em so early on a Sunday morning .
