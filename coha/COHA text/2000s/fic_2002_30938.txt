I had a cousin , Randall , killed on Iwo Jima . Have I told you ? The last man killed on the island , they said ; killed after the fighting had ceased and the rest of the soldiers had already been transported away to hospitals or to bodybags . Killed mopping up . That 's what they called it . A mopping-up operation . I remember Mother sat down at the kitchen table when she read the news . It came in the form of a letter from Randall 's father , Great-Uncle Sterling , written in hard dark ink , the letters slanted and angry as if they were aware of the meaning of the words they formed . I was in the kitchen when Mother opened it and I took the letter and read it myself . It said that Randall was presumed dead , though they had no information of the whereabouts of his body ; that he had reported to whomever he was intended to report to after the surrender of the Japanese , that he had , from all accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had visited him as a young girl . They lived across the bay from Baltimore , outside Sudlersville . No town , really , just a crossroad and a post office and farms hemmed in by cornfields . Theirs was a large brick house set far back from the road , entirely wrong for that landscape , like it had been hauled up from Savannah or Louisville to prove a point . It stood in constant shadow at the end of an oak-lined drive and I remember our first visit , how we drove through that tunnel of oak slowly , the day blustery , cool . Sterling was not what we in those days called jovial . His wife had died years before , leaving him , old enough to be a grandfather , alone to care for his only child . He had long rebuked Mother 's invitations but for some reason had scrawled a note in his Christmas card that year  --  this was before the war , ' 39 or ' 40  --  asking us to join them for Easter dinner . Mother wore the same Easter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the hallway linen closest , but she had sewed each of us a new Easter dress and insisted Daddy wear a clean shirt and tie . For him this was nothing short of sacrifice . Rita said he acted like those clothes might shatter if he breathed . Daddy turned off the engine and we all sat , listening to the motor ticking . If Mother had lost her determination and suggested we back out then and there , we would have agreed . " Well , " she said , smoothing out the lap of her dress . It was what she did to buy time . We girls were n't moving anyway . We were tired enough ; it was a long drive from Pennsylvania . " Wake me up when it 's over , " Rita said . She always had a line like that . She curled up and thrust her long legs across Betty and me , picking a fight . Betty grabbed her foot and twisted it until Rita shrieked For the love of Pete ! Mother ignored them , reapplying the lipstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked out the window . I 'm not sure about Daddy . No one wanted to make the first move , Betty twisting Rita 's foot harder and Rita shrieking For the love of Pete , get your gosh darn hands off me ! and Mother jerking around and telling Rita to stop using that language and to act her age . The last reprimand struck Rita to the core . She sat up quickly and yanked the door open . Did I say oak ? It might have been walnut . I believe at that point , standing outside the car , we heard the comforting thwack of a walnut on a tin roof , the sound popping the balloon Rita had inflated , releasing us to walk , like a family , to the front door , where Randall already stood , waiting . He had some sort of sweet-smelling water brushed into his hair . This I remember . It was the first thing you would have noticed . He also had red hair , red as mine , and freckles over most of his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand out in greeting . His were the most delicate fingers I had ever seen on a boy , though he was nearly a teenager by then . I have wondered since whether he polished his nails , since they were shiny , almost wet . Remember he was a son without a mother , which is a terrible thing to be , and that Great-Uncle Sterling was as hard as his name . Anyway , Rita and Betty paid him little mind . They followed Mother and Daddy in to find Sterling and we were left , quite suddenly , alone . Randall shrugged as if I had proposed a game of cards and asked if I wanted to see his room . No one seemed much concerned about us , so I said sure . We went down a water-stained hallway he called the Gallery of Maps , after some hallway he had read about in the Vatican lined with frescoes of maps from before the world was round . Anyway , he stood there showing me the various countries , pointing out what he called troublespots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the palest white at the tips , as if he had spent too long in the bath . We continued , passing one of those old-fashioned intercom contraptions they used to have to ring servants . Randall worked a few of the mysterious oiled levers and then spoke , gravely , into the mouthpiece . " I have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears , and sweat , " he said . Churchill , of course , though at the time I had no idea . I simply stood there waiting , watching as Randall hung up the mouthpiece , shrugged again , and opened a door to a back staircase so narrow we had to turn sideways to make the corner . " They were smaller in the old days , " Randall said , and then , perhaps because I did n't respond , he stopped and turned toward me . " Who ? " I said . " People , " he said . " Oh , " I said , waiting . I had never been in the dark with a boy his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We reached a narrow door and pushed out , onto another landing , continuing down a second , longer hallway . The house seemed comprised of a hundred little boxes , each with tiny doors and passages , eaves to duck under , one-flight stairways to climb . Gloomy , all of it , though Randall did n't appear to notice . He talked all the while of how slaves had traveled through here on the underground railway from Louisiana , and how one family had lived in this house behind a false wall he was still trying to find . He said he knew this not from words but from knowing . He said he saw their ghosts sometimes  --  there were five of them  --  a mother and a father and three children , he could n't tell what . But he 'd find their hiding place , he said . He had the instinct . I 'm not sure whether I was more interested in hearing about slaves in secret rooms or hearing about their ghosts . This was Maryland , remember , the east side . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the colored sat starboard , the whites port , and docking felt like the flow of two rivers , neither feeding the other . In Pennsylvania colored people were colored people , and one of your grandfather 's best friends was a colored doctor named Tate Williams , who everybody called Tate Billy , which always made me laugh , since I 'd never heard of a nickname for a surname . Anyway , Randall finally pushed on what looked like just another of the doors leading to the next stairway and there we were : his room , a big square box filled with books on shelves and stacked high on the floor . Beyond this a line of dormer windows looked out to the oaks , or walnuts . I could hear my sisters ' muffled shouts below and went to see , but we were too high up and the windows were filthy , besides . Words were written in the grime . Copacetic , I still recall . Epistemological , belie . " What are these ? " I said . " Words to learn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " I said . This was n't at all what I expected . It felt as if I had climbed a mountain only to reach a summit enshrouded in fog . Randall seemed oblivious ; he began digging through his stacks of books . I watched him for a while , then spelled out HELP on the glass . I asked Randall what he was doing , and he told me to be patient . He was looking for the exact right passage , he said . He planned to teach me the art of " dramatic presentation . " Is n't it funny ? I have no recollection of what he finally found . And though I can still hear him telling me they were smaller then , ask me what we recited in the hours before we were called to the table , legs up , in his window seat , our dusty view that of the old trees , their leaves a fuzzy new green of spring , of Easter , and I will say I have no idea . I know I must have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to keep from my voice ; he with his natural tenderness , as if he were presenting a gift to the very words he read by speaking them aloud . I know that sometimes our knees touched and that we pulled away from one another , or we did not . I wish I had a picture . We must have been beautiful with the weak light coming through those old dormers , our knees up and backs against either side of the window seat , an awkward W , books in our hands . It became our habit to write letters . Randall wrote every first Sunday of the month . He would tell me what new book he was reading , what he 'd marked to show me . I might describe a particular day , such as the time Daddy filled the backyard with water to make an ice skating pond , though we told Mother the pump had broken and it was all we could do to turn the thing off before the rain cellar flooded . Of course , once the sun wore down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your grandmother 's peony bed , Daddy had to tell her the truth . She loved her peonies and fretted all that winter that we had somehow damaged the roots , that spring would come and the pinks she had ordered , the ones with the name that rhymed with Frank Sinatra , would have no company . But everything grew and blossomed on schedule , and we ended up calling the peony bed our lake and threatening to flood it every winter . Randall sent me back a letter about a book he had recently read on the gardens of Kyoto , how the gardens were made of sand , gravel , and rock . No flowers , he said . No pinks . Once in a while they use moss , but even their moss is n't green like we know green . No grass green or leaf green but a kind of grayish , he wrote . You ca n't even walk in these gardens because they 're more like paintings . You view them from a distance , he wrote , their fragments in relation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I was baffled . I knew we were now at war with the Japanese ; we were repeatedly given classroom instruction on the failings of the Japanese character . We had learned of crucifixions and tortures ; we understood the Japanese to be evil  --  not only did they speak a language no one could decipher , but they engaged in acts of moral deprivation our teachers deemed too shocking to repeat . I understood them to be a secret , somehow , a secret we should n't hear . Now , oddly , I knew something of their gardens . The last time I saw him was the Easter of 1944 . He was not yet seventeen  --  can you imagine ? the age of enlistment  --  but would soon be , and he understood that it would be best if he went to war , that Sterling expected him to , that there were certain things that boys did without question . He never spoke of this to me ; I learned it all later . Instead , his letters that winter were filled with some tremendous discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Easter , not beforehand . You can imagine my guesses . Daddy had barely shut off the engine when I opened the door and sprung out . I might have bypassed all those narrow rooms and passageways altogether , scaled the tree and banged on one of those filthy windows , but I could feel Mother 's eyes . She wanted me to slow down , to stay a part of them . In truth , the drive had been a sad one  --  Rita newly married and stationed with Roger in California , Betty oddly silent . Our first visit seemed light-years past , an adventure far more pleasant than it had actually been , a family outing when we were still family . We had grown into something altogether different : guests at a party with little in common . I stood , waiting for everyone to get out of the car , waiting until Mother opened the door and yelled , Hello . Then I ran to Randall 's room . I knew the way , could find it blindfolded  --  through the passageways and up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallery of Maps , the danger spots , the capital cities . I picked up the mouthpiece and recited my Roosevelt impression  --  " I hate war , Eleanor hates war , and our dog , Fala , hates war "  --  just in case anyone was listening . When I got to Randall 's door I saw that it was ajar , so I went in without knocking . He stood facing the line of dormers , his back to me , his stance so entirely unfamiliar , so adult , that for an instant I thought I might have barged in to the wrong room , that for all this time a second , older Randall had lived just next door . " Boo , " I said . I was that kind of girl . He turned , startled , and I saw he had been writing my name on the window grime . He was so thin , rail-thin , we called it . A beanpole . Just legs and arms and wrists and neck . I imagine if he had been permitted to live his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , who would have cooked him certain foods and seen that his scarves were wrapped tight in winter . No matter . He crossed the room to me . " Any guesses ? " he said . " None , " I said , blushing . This was the age of movie star magazines , of starlets discovered at soda fountains . I had plenty of guesses , each sillier than the next , but I knew enough to keep them to myself . He marched me out of his room to the cook 's stairway , a long narrow corridor down to the foyer , then pushed on a second door I 'd always assumed led to the pantry . It took us back to the Gallery of Maps , where he paused , as if expecting me to react . " So ? " I said . He ignored me , taking my hand and leading me to the darkest continent in the Gallery  --  an hourglass stain near the far end tucked behind the door to the musty unused parlor . Randall swung the door shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , where Antarctica would have been . " Look , " Randall said . And then I saw : a tiny black thread , horizontal , a hairline fracture dividing time remaining from time spent unlike the other cracks in the walls , the veinlike fissures that ran through that old house . " A clue , " Randall said . Sometimes , when I think about it , I see the two of us there , Randall and me , from a different perspective , as if I were Mother walking through the door to call us for supper , finding us alone , red-haired cousins , twins sketched quickly : bones , hair , shoes , buttons . Look at us , we seem to say . One will never grow old , never age . One will never plant tomatoes , drive automobiles , go to dances . One will never drink too much and sit alone , wishing , in the dark . Randall knocked on the wall and I heard a strange hollowness . " Right here , " he said . " Right beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from its base like a punching bag . He held it there and got down on all fours , then he crawled in . I followed , no doubt oblivious to the white bloomers Mother still insisted I wear with every Easter dress . The wall snapped shut , throwing us into instant black . It was difficult to breathe , the sudden frenzied dark unbearable . And cold ! As if the chill from all those other rooms had been absorbed by this tiny cave , the dirt floor damp beneath my hands , my knees . " Randall ? " I said . " Here , " he said . Then , again . " Here . " His voice seemed flung , untethered ; it came from every direction and I began to feel the panic that comes over me in enclosed places . I would have cried had Randall not chosen that moment to strike a match . He was right there beside me , touchable , close . I sat as he held the match to a candle on the floor . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its walls papered with yellowed newsprint , the words buried by numbers . Literally hundreds of numbers had been scrawled across the walls , the ceiling . Everywhere you looked . The strangest thing . Some written in pencil , others in what looked like orange crayon , smeared or faint , deep enough to tear the newsprint . There seemed to be no order , no system to them . Just numbers on top of numbers on top of numbers . I could hear Randall breathing . " What do you think they were counting ? " I said . " Heartbeats , " he said . It was the slaves ' hiding place , of course . I crawled to the far corner , my palm catching on something hard : a spool of thread . Red , I remember , its color intact . There were other things to look at . Randall had collected them , and now he showed me , piece by piece : a rusted needle , a strand of red thread still through its eye , knotted at the end ; a leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed on them , an ancient tarot , perhaps ; a yellow tooth , a handkerchief  --  the initials RBP embroidered in blue thread on its hem  --  a folded piece of paper . Randall unfolded it slowly , and I believed , for an instant , that the slaves ' story would be written here . Another clue . But there was nothing to read , simply more numbers , a counting gone haywire . Randall held the paper out to me and I took it , feeling , when I did , the brush of his soft fingers . " It must have been the only thing they knew , " I said , staring at the numbered paper , my own fingers burning . " Or had to learn , " Randall said . " Right , " I said , not fully understanding . " Look , " he said . He held a comb , its wooden teeth spaced unevenly . " I bet they played it , " he said . " I bet they did , " I said . Even then I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something that might match his discovery . But all I could think of was the dark , and the way the candlelight made us long shadows . I pulled my legs beneath me , still cold , and pretended to read the numbers . After a while , aware of his inattention , I looked up . He was bent over , holding the needle close to the candlelight , sewing , it appeared , the hem of his pant leg with a concentration I had only witnessed in his reading . I leaned in to see . RB , he had embroidered , and now he stitched the straight tail of the P. He startled . I 'm not sure we had ever been that close to one another , eye-to-eye , my breath his breath . The candlelight made us look much older than we were , eternal , somehow : stand-ins for gods . " I thought I 'd take him along , " he said , by way of explanation . We remained in the slaves ' hiding place until supper , sitting knee-to-knee , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read some advertisement for Doctor something-or-other 's cure-all , which worked on pigs and people , and we laughed , then he took the stub of a pencil he always kept knotted in his shoelaces and wrote three numbers across the advertisement  --  5 , 23 , 1927  --  the date and year of his birth . He stared at the numbers a minute , and then drew a dash after them , in the way you sometimes see in books after an author 's name and birthdate , the dash like the scythe of the Grim Reaper . " Do n't , " I said , licking my finger and reaching to erase the line . I may have smeared it a bit , I do n't know . At this point Randall grabbed my wrist , surprising me with the strength in those fingers . It was the most wonderful of gestures . He brought my hand to his cheek and kissed my palm , no doubt filthy from crawling around on that floor . He seemed not to care . He kept his lips there for a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away as I was to allow him to continue , held my breath , listening to my own heart beat stronger . There was one other after that . Visit , I mean . The morning Randall came through Philadelphia on his way out . He was going to ride the Union Pacific , in those days a tunnel on wheels chock-full of soldiers stretching from one end of the country to the other  --  some heading east to Europe , others heading west to the Pacific . Your grandmother would tell me stories of worse times , during the early days of the Depression , when she said that same train took children from families who could no longer feed them . She said she remembered a black-haired boy walking by their farmhouse , stopping with his parents for a drink of water . They were on their way to the train , the orphan train , they called it , sending the boy east , where someone from an agency would pick him up and find him a new place to live . She said it was a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms heading out to save the world from disaster . She described children in trains , sitting high on their cardboard suitcases to get a view out the window , their eyes big as quarters , their pockets weighted down with nothing but the few treasures their parents had to give them  --  first curls , nickels , a shark tooth , ribbons  --  things they no doubt lost along the way . That , she 'd say the few times I tried talking to her of Randall , is the worst thing of all . Children given up for good . But I do n't know . I remember the look of Randall stepping off the train . His big , drab coat , his leather shoes polished to a gleam shiny as those fingernails . It was a terrible sight , I can tell you . Mother and I had driven to meet him at the station . I believe it was the only time I ever saw him when I was n't in an Easter dress . You would have laughed . I wore a pink wool skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart . A gift from Rita . I was so proud of those clothes , and the lipstick , Mother 's shade , that I 'd dab with a perfumed handkerchief I kept in my coat pocket . But the look of Randall stepping off the train . He had grown that year even taller , and we could see his thin , worried face above the pack of other soldiers . The morning was blustery , and it felt like there might be snow . Other girls were on the platform slapping their hands together , standing with brothers , boyfriends . We were a collection of women and boys . Mother stepped forward a bit and called out to him , and Randall turned and smiled and rushed over to us , his hand extended . But that was for Mother . When I went to shake it , he pulled me into a hug . He wore the drab , regulation wool coat , as I have said , and a scarf , red , knotted at his neck , and I tasted that scarf and smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco smoke all at once . " Look at you , " he said , and squeezed me tighter . Mother knew of a diner nearby , and we went , though we had to stand some time waiting for a table , the room swamped with boys in uniform . I became aware of Randall watching me , though I pretended not to notice . I had come in to the age of boys finding me pretty , and I felt always as if I walked on a stage , lighted to an audience somewhere out in the dark . Mother chattered , clearly nervous in that big room with all those soldiers , waiters racing to and fro , splashing coffee on the black-and-white linoleum floor , wiping their foreheads with the dishrags that hung from their waists , writing checks , shouting orders to the cooks . Yet all the while I felt Randall 's gaze , as if he needed to tell me something , and that all I had to do was turn to him to find the clue . But there was n't much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Soldiers scraped back their chairs , stood in line to pay their checks . Everyone had the same train to catch . Mother smoothed her skirt out and said she believed we should be heading back ourselves . Then she excused herself , saying she 'd rather use the ladies ' room there than at the train station . Randall and I watched her weave her way around the other tables , some empty , others full . We were , quite suddenly , alone . Have I told you he was handsome ? I did n't know him well , but he had red hair , red as mine , and a kind , thin face . He might have had the most beautiful thin face I have ever seen . I should have told him that then , but I was too shy . This is what I 've been thinking about : maybe he was n't waiting to tell me anything , but waiting to hear something from me . I may have taken another sip of coffee , then . I know I did anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the train up I sat next to a guy from Louisville , " he finally said . " His name was Hog Phelps . " " Hog ? " I said . " Said he was n't the only Hog in his family , said he was from a long line of Hogs . " I looked at Randall and he shrugged . Then he laughed and I did , too . It seemed like such a funny thing to say . I received only one letter from Randall after that . It was written the day before he sailed for the Far East , mailed from San Francisco . I remember that the stamp on the envelope was a common one from that time  --  Teddy Roosevelt leading his Rough Riders up San Juan Hill  --  and that Randall had drawn a bubble of speech coming from his mouth that said , " Carry on ! " I opened the letter with a mixture of trepidation and excitement . I was too young and too stupid to understand what Randall was about to do . I imagined his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be filled with love sonnets , that it would gush with the same romantic pablum I devoured from those movie star magazines . Instead , it described San Francisco  --  the fog that rolled in early afternoons across the bay , the Golden Gate Bridge and how the barking sea lions could be heard from so many streets , and the vistas that he discovered , as if painted solely for him , on the long solitary walks he took daily through the city . He wrote how he seemed to have lost interest in books , that he no longer had the patience . There was no time , he wrote , to sit . He wanted to walk , to never stop walking . If he could , he would walk all the way to Japan by way of China . Hell , he wrote ( and I remember the look of that word , how Randall seemed to be trying out a different , fiercer Randall ) , when I 'm finished with this I 'm going to walk around the entire world . I tried to picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of a barracks , like something I might have seen in Life . I pictured him stooped over , with a reader 's concentration , digging the pen into the regulation paper in the way he would have , if we were talking face-to-face , stressed a word . I saw him in civilian clothes , in the dress pants he wore every Easter . The same ones , as far as I could tell  --  a light gray wool , each year hitched up a little higher and now , leg crossed across one knee , entirely ill-fitting , the RBP far above the ankle . He might have , from time to time , put the pen down and leaned back to think of a particular description , fingering those initials he had stitched in red . It was clear to me even then that he had worked on the letter like a boy who wants to be a writer . Certain words broke his true voice , were tried on , tested for fit . They were a hat too big for him  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randall might have become . The Hell , as I have mentioned . A line from some dead poet  --  I would think of a thousand things , lovely and durable , and taste them slowly  --  I had heard him recite in his room a hundred times , and other words I recognized as words still left to learn . It seemed he wanted to cram everything in . Still , it is a beautiful letter . I have saved it for years . It finds its way into my hands at the oddest times , and when it does I always hold it for a while . Teddy shouts Carry on ! , and I curse him . All of them . Then I pull out the paper , one creased sheath , and unfold it as slowly as I would a gift I 'd never opened . My fear is that somehow in my absence , his words have come undone , been shaken loose , rearranged ; the letters shuffled into indecipherable forms . But there ! My name in salutation , the sweetness of the attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may have pictured me when  --  writing at that desk beneath the window , the metal newly polished , the air fresh , eucalyptus-scented , the sea lions barking  --  he signed Love , Randall , and underlined it with a flourish as elegant as a bow .
