<p> He had watched her speak so many things into existence  --  a home , a job , an education  --  that he knew it worked . If he would just say it and believe it , keep repeating it over and over , it would happen . That is what he had been taught , what he had been shown , what he decided to try . <p> So what that he had played in only five games in his freshman year of high school , or that the state of Arizona had produced national basketball stars about as often as it had encountered a snowfall in the desert . <p> Just speak and believe . Speak and believe . <p> " My name is Richard Jefferson and by the time I reach my sophomore year , I will be all-state . By the time I reach my senior year , I will be all-American . " <p> Fourteen-year-old Richard Jefferson repeated those two sentences into a tape recorder for five minutes . <p> " I would listen to it right before I went to bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , " Jefferson said last week . " It was probably only a total of five or six minutes , but to put it on and then work out or to put it on and watch TV made it something that stuck in your head . And apparently it happened . " <p> Jefferson indeed became all-state as a sophomore at Moon Valley High School in Phoenix and an all-American as a senior . He went on to play at the University of Arizona , and now , with the Nets , he is one of the best small forwards in the National Basketball Association , one whose team is now trying to fight its way to the N.B.A. finals for the third consecutive season . <p> His belief system is a part of his success . Thank his mother , Meekness LeCato , for that . <p> " We always tried to be very cautious about what they listened to , " LeCato said by telephone last week , referring to Jefferson and her two other sons . " Well , Richard had a tape in his room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what it was . When I heard it , I almost fell off my feet . It was Richard making a positive confession about his life by saying , ' I will do this , I will do that . ' He had seen us put the principles of God into action , and he did the exact same thing . I hope he realizes that where he is today is because of the things we did yesterday . " <p> Meekness LeCato used to be known as Wanda Marshall . She was a single mother with three young children living on welfare in Los Angeles . A born-again Christian , she said her fortunes changed when she was taught in church to believe in Proverbs 18:21 , the biblical verse that begins , " Death and life are in the power of the tongue . " <p> In 1986 , she moved to Phoenix because of its lower cost of living , and , through her faith , she began verbalizing positive things that she wished to happen in her life , a common practice in some sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession . She also changed her name to Meekness after a preacher called her by that name at a revival meeting . <p> " That 's how I got off welfare , " said LeCato , who not long after married John LeCato , a friend from her childhood in Philadelphia . <p> " I got a job right away in Phoenix , and every day I went to work confessing what I wanted . I was just using what God had said : ' Death and life are in the power of the tongue . ' I try to be very , very selective with my words because they 're not idle words . Words are full of life and power . " <p> Now , LeCato , a high school dropout , is a member of the English department faculty at South Mountain Community College in Phoenix and is working on her doctorate . <p> In between classes and her obligations at the Phoenix church that she and her husband led for 10 years , LeCato also traveled to Africa for 13 consecutive summers as a missionary , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always told them that if God can get me off welfare and change my life around , then God can do it for my brothers and sisters who are living in poverty , " she said . <p> That is the type of household Jefferson grew up in , and it affected him in any number of ways . One summer , when he was 8 , he joined his mother and his stepfather in Kenya . <p> " It taught me to appreciate other people 's culture , " Jefferson , 23 , said . " So it 's not about listening to one type of music , or liking one type of show or reading one type of magazine . It 's about opening up your mind . " <p> While Jefferson 's cocky , high-flying game is pure hip-hop , he is not . In addition to rap music , he listens to James Brown , Marvin Gaye , Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones . He frequents Broadway shows , and his loft apartment in Weehawken , N.J. , is party central for him and his Nets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as his girlfriend . <p> " There are always people at my house , just hanging out , playing video games , watching TV , playing Ping-Pong , " said Jefferson , who is planning to move to Manhattan over the summer . " Friends from back home , teammates . If you come to my house , we 're always getting into something . " <p> LeCato said her son has always been about having fun . What Jefferson did not find fun was schoolwork . He was an avid reader ; she found him one night in the closet reading with a flashlight . But he was into sports magazines , not textbooks . During junior high school , he was academically ineligible for the school team . <p> Jefferson 's grades as a high school freshman were not much better , but he was allowed to stay on the team . Still , he was a cut-up and his freshman coach wanted nothing to do with him . <p> " He never did anything evil , just annoying , " John Boie , Moon Valley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might all of a sudden chuck up a halfcourt shot during practice . So we moved him up to the varsity , and I told the varsity kids to hit him if he ever said anything , because Richard talked a lot of trash . " <p> Jefferson 's chatter nearly led to fisticuffs several times . As a teenager at Cave Creek Park , where he often played for five hours a day , he had men in their 20 's and 30 's ready to pounce on him , Jefferson and his mother said . <p> " He was so tall that no one knew he was so young , " LeCato said . " But he trash-talked so much that a couple of times , he was about to get whipped . Then , someone would say : ' Man , he ai n't but 13 . He ai n't but 15 . Let him go . " ' <p> Boie and his varsity players ' tough love finally got through to Jefferson . As a junior , he made the honor roll . <p> " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around school just smiling and having a good time , " Jefferson said . " I would hit the books to a degree , but I was a very social person . I do n't think anyone ever questioned my intellect or my intelligence , but they just needed to get me to focus more . " <p> Doing his schoolwork did not rid Jefferson of his playfulness . In the season opener his senior year , he scored a school-record 46 points , all while attempting to get the phone number of a cheerleader from the opposing team . <p> " To me , that story sums up what Richard was like , " said Boie , who speaks with Jefferson by telephone every few months . <p> For all his antics , though , Jefferson said he never forgot the lessons he learned from his parents ' experiences in Africa . Watching them take clothing to Africans and even pay for the schooling of some of the people they were helping made Jefferson appreciate what he had . <p> " That 's one of the things that impacted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how different things are , " he said . " It puts an understanding in your head that your parents might not get you the shoes you want , might not get you the clothes you want , but then they 're going over there and buying shoes for people that do n't have any . So you learn not to complain about much . " <p> Jefferson also learned to be frugal . Some of his friends call him one of the more financially prudent people they know . Instead of chains , he prefers T-shirts with witty phrases on them . His one car is a Mercedes-Benz , but he bought it used from Sacramento Kings guard Mike Bibby , a friend who also grew up in Phoenix . <p> " I spend my money on entertainment , " Jefferson said . " I 'm not a big jewelry guy . I do n't like real fancy clothes . " <p> He added , " I 'd rather go out and have a good time , go to dinner , hang out with my friends , than spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . " <p> " That 's just the way I was brought up , " he said . An upbringing that still resonates . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Meekness and John LeCato , Richard Jefferson 's mother and stepfather , served as missionaries in Africa .
