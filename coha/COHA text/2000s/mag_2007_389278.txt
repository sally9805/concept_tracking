FOR MORE INSTRUCTION THAT FITS YOUR GAME , GO TO GOLF.COM POWER HITTER You hit the ball a long way , but your game needs control and consistency . Get yourself in trouble IF YOU 'RE like a lot of long hitters , your monster drives are matched only by your monstrosities  --  the kind that land you on parts of the golf course that do n't see many visitors . But do you ever actually practice recovery shots ? The next time you 're at the practice range , try playing some shots from the worst locations you can find . Drop your ball between two pine trees , or bury your ball on the downslope of a bunker . Find a patch of two-foot-high weeds and see how many balls you can pop out . Or set your ball on some hardpan and try to pitch it over a bunker to a tight pin . If possible , hit several balls from each location using a different technique and see which shot works best . If you make this drill a regular part of your practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatively the next time you find yourself playing from an ugly spot on the course . LOW HANDICAPPER You play well , but want to shave those last few strokes off your handicap . Pitch it close from a downhill lie EVEN IF YOUR short game is solid , there 's a good chance that playing a pitch shot from a downhill lie still gives you fits . For starters , downhill shots are tougher in general  --  it 's hard to make solid contact from such an awkward position , and it 's much harder to control the flight of the ball because the slope delofts the clubface . Things become even more complicated when playing a downhill pitch , since you usually need less than a full swing , which requires you to properly gauge the correct length of backswing and follow-through to use for the distance you 're trying to cover . There are two important things to remember when you face a pitch from a downhill lie . First , do n't try to do too much with the shot . It 's possible to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not going to be able to pop up a high , soft lob shot . For this reason , pick a target line and a landing spot that will let you hit a relatively low shot that can run unimpeded to the green . Second , adjust your address position . For starters , do n't lean into the hill  --  you 'll almost certainly hit the shot fat . Instead , keep your shoulders as parallel to the slope as possible . You may feel as though you 're going to tumble down the hill , but you can counter this by flaring your downhill foot and keeping your uphill knee flexed . Position the ball just off your right heel and angle your hands and the shaft slightly ahead of the ball . Take no more than a three-quarter backswing , and make sure your hands come through impact in front of the clubhead  --  this will ensure that the clubhead reaches the bottom of its swing arc just as it contacts the back of the ball . HIGH HANDICAPPER You have potential , but must solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLAYER who struggles to shoot lower scores , you naturally concern yourself with the parts of your swing that occur before you hit the ball , specifically your setup and backswing . But did you know that how you finish your swing is the best indication of how well you 've done everything else during your swing ? If you can learn what a good finish position feels like , you 'll have an easier time making the proper series of movements during your swing to ensure that you reach that position . These fundamental finish positions are what you should be trying to achieve . Weight over your front foot By the time your body has stopped turning in your follow-through , about 90 percent of your weight should be on your front foot . If it is n't , you 've made an error . As you move into your follow-through , your front foot should accept your body 's weight by rolling slightly to the outside edge , while your back foot rids itself of most of your body weight by rising up on its toes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot off the ground at the end of your swing without losing your balance . Belt buckle and sternum straight ahead There 's a simple way to know whether you 've correctly rotated your hips during your swing : Check your belt buckle and the buttons on your shirt . Both should face directly at the target when you finish your follow-through . If they do n't  --  that is , if they point right of the target when you finish  --  chances are good that you 're moving your hips laterally through the hitting zone , rather than rotating them . Right shoulder down , left hip up In a good finish , your right shoulder and hip should be lower than the left . This will tilt your upper body slightly to the right , which should mimic exactly the slight tilt to the right that your spine should have at address and impact . Hands over left shoulder Your hands should finish to the left of your head and above your left shoulder . This is an indication that your arms have swung the club freely through impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have lost some flexibility and power , but you still can play well . Tips to hit hybrids HYBRID clubs are one of the most significant equipment introductions of the last 25 years , but while many golfers  --  particularly you and your fellow seniors  --  are rushing to take their 3- , 4- and even 5-woods out of their bag in favor of the new clubs , the fact remains that these clubs are not always a miracle cure . Because they set up similar to fairway woods , hybrids can easily create problems often found with fairway clubs , such as thin and topped shots . The biggest mistake you can make with a hybrid ( or a fairway wood , for that matter ) is to keep your weight on your right side in the downswing in the mistaken belief that you can help " lift " the ball into the air by leaning away from your target . When you do this , the club often bottoms out before it reaches the ball . That means that when the club strikes the ball it 's already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of contact . The result is a low screamer or , worse , an ugly topped shot that rolls about 10 yards . To make solid contact with your hybrids you must transfer your weight to your left foot on the downswing and allow your right heel to lift off the ground as you swing through the hitting area . To do this , make sure to rotate your hips aggressively to the left through impact . This automatically pulls your right heel up off the ground and shifts your weight to your left side , which ensures that the clubhead sweeps through impact and lifts the ball into the air using the loft of the club , rather than getting help from you . STRAIGHT HITTER You keep the ball in play , but a lack of distance puts pressure on your game . Make good putts on bad greens WHILE MANY of you would probably pay a lot of money to putt on the emerald-green carpets you see the PGA Tour play on every weekend on TV , chances are that the greens you encounter in real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an easy way to get your ball rolling smoothly on a slow or spongy putting surface . On softer putting surfaces , problems occur when your putter makes contact with the ball at or just before the low point of the stroke . On fast and neatly manicured greens , you can get away with making level or even slightly descending contact , but if the grass is long or the putting surface is spongy , this stroke will cause the grass to grab the ball and make it skid or pop up , knocking your putt off-line . To counter this , you need to make sure that you make contact with the ball on the upswing . At address , position your head so that your eyes are directly over the target line ( as they always should be ) , but move your head so your eyes are just behind the ball . Moving your head moves your sternum , too , and that 's what defines where the low point of a pendulum-type stroke occurs ( in this case , behind the ball ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upswing , it immediately starts the ball rolling instead of hopping or skipping . You may not be able to smooth out the imperfections on a bad green , but you can start your ball rolling from the get-go , and that 's how you give yourself the best shot of keeping your ball on-line .
