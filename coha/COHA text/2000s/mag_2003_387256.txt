<p> GREEN ONIONS CAUSE MORE THAN TEARS . Recent outbreaks of hepatitis A in several states have been associated with eating raw or undercooked green onions ( scallions ) , says the Food and Drug Administration . In September , outbreaks occurred mostly in restaurants in Tennessee , North Carolina , and Georgia . In late October an outbreak that affected several hundred Pennsylvania residents was connected to a single Mexican restaurant that served undercooked green onions in its salsa . Authorities at both the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control say the contaminated green onions came from Mexico . U.S. officials are currently conducting a prolonged investigation in cooperation with Mexican health authorities . <p> Hepatitis A is a liver disease that develops within six weeks of exposure , according to the FDA Web site . It is usually a mild disease characterized by jaundice ( yellow discoloration of the skin ) , fatigue , abdominal pain , loss of appetite , nausea , diarrhea , and fever . In rare cases , hepatitis A can be fatal . The FDA advises consumers to cook green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe ; check food purchased at restaurants and grocery stores ; and ask whether menu items contain raw or lightly cooked green onions . As a further precaution , the FDA has halted all shipments of green onions coming from Mexican firms suspected of contamination . <p> DO N'T JUDGE AN AIRLINE BY ITS NAME  --  YET . Bankrupt United Airlines ' new low-fare carrier , Ted , will begin flying next February . United created the low-cost airline as an attempt to recapture market share lost to other low-cost competitors such as Southwest , America West , and JetBlue . As a bonus to United customers , Ted will be linked to United 's frequent-flyer program . According to the company 's press release , United is trying to pitch Ted as " laid-back style of fun , to the low-fare travel marketplace , " perhaps trying to mimic the marketing strategy of Southwest , known for its more informal approach to customers . Ted , unlike Southwest , however , will provide pre-assigned seating and an Economy Plus section for " loyal customers . " The new airline will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reno , Nev. ; Las Vegas ; New Orleans ; Tampa , Fla. ; Orlando , Fla. ; Ontario , Calif. ; and Fort Lauderdale , Fla . <p> But what about the name ? Ted was chosen because it is the last three letters in United , signifying a smaller , cheaper alternative . ( See " The Low-Cost Future of Air Travel , " CR , September 2003 . ) <p> CARB WARS : The American bread industry is worried that the growing popularity of low-carbohydrate diets is having a severe effect on sales . The industry 's trade group , The National Bread Leadership Council , even organized a " bread summit " last month that drew representatives from more than 100 companies to discuss the public 's increasing aversion to bread products . The NBLC says that 40% of Americans are eating less bread than they did a year ago . According to CNN Money , estimates of the number of Americans who have incorporated low-carb eating habits vary from 5 million to more than 30 million . A British paper , The Independent , put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bread sales is also unclear . According to a survey by the Bread Bakers Guild of America , about half of the bakers in the United States reported no decline in sales compared to last year , and about 25% said their sales had grown . Companies that make low-carb versions of popular bread-based products , however , are reporting record sales . The Food and Drug Administration , meanwhile , maintains that breads , grains , and pastas are still a central part of a healthy diet . <p> FIRST MP3s , NOW THIS . Scientists at Princeton University , in coordination with computer giant Hewlett-Packard , have created a fingertip-size memory tab that they say will replace CDs in five years , reports Ananova News . The paper-thin device could store more than a gigabyte of information in one cubic centimeter of space and could be used to produce a single-use memory card that permanently stores data . According to the scientists , this new technology would be faster and easier to operate than a CD . Also , the card does not use any movable parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> While the technology is exciting , similar devices that have appeared in the past , such as the mini-disc , failed to resound with consumers . CDs are already experiencing a falloff in sales in recent years because of the growth of M players and online music . <p> BUT DO THEY LOOK REAL ? A divided FDA panel has recommended that the government permit general use of silicone gel implants for breast enhancement , a use that has been banned since 1992 , reports the Washington Post . Although citing health dangers , the panel said that risks were not significant enough to keep the implants off the market . Since the FDA banned the implants , plastic surgeons have relied on saline-solution implants . The issue will be taken up formally by the FDA sometime next year . The FDA usually follows the advice of the advisory panel . <p> Silicone implants were banned after the FDA received reports of women experiencing neurological and connective tissue disorders such as arthritis , lupus erythematosus or fibromyalgia . In 1999 , however , the Institute of Medicine conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implants were not responsible for the health problems . <p> I JUST BOUGHT A DVD PLAYER ! China recently announced the launch of its DVD-alternative , the EVD , in a move designed to save Chinese companies millions of dollars in annual royalties , reports China Tech News . The company , Beijing E-World Technology , says the new EVD format will offer five times the image quality of DVD movies and provide a higher data-storage capacity to cut down on disk space . The company expects the EVD to become the country 's standard for the recording and playback of digital video , replacing the U.S.-made DVD format . According to CTN , industry analysts are not at all confident the new format will translate into broader global sales or compete with the DVD . <p> For now at least the price of an EVD player will definitely limit its appeal in the United States , where a DVD player costs half as much . The other question is whether the great producer of DVDs  --  Hollywood  --  will embrace the EVD format , a notion that seems unlikely for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard . <p> THE FUTURE WAS N'T CONVENIENT . A product designed to usher in the next era in convenience shopping went belly-up earlier this month when McDonald 's cancelled its year-long experiment with the Redbox kiosk , an automated convenience store , reports the Washington Post . Located at strategic areas around the Baltimore/Washington , D.C. , area , the Redbox worked like a super vending machine , dispensing everything from sandwiches to toilet paper 24 hours a day . But with profit margins around 5% , the Redboxes were dependent on high sales to be profitable . Unfortunately for McDonald 's , Washington consumers simply were n't interested in buying eggs out of a steel cage . The Redbox had no connection to McDonald 's fast-food restaurants . <p> Some analysts pointed to the American Consumers ' " long infatuation with quality control and customer service " as a reason for the Redbox failure , reports the Post . In Japan , conversely , vending machines that sell beer and neckties are very popular . Other observers say vending technology simply is n't advanced enough to make it cost-effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about carbonated beverages in public schools , Coca-Cola Co. has announced guidelines for selling soda to grade-school students , reports Bloomberg News . The world 's largest soft-drink maker said no carbonated drinks should be sold in elementary schools during the school day and that middle and high schools should sell carbonated drinks only in vending machines , not in cafeterias . The guidelines also pledge that Coca-Cola will sell 100% juices , milk-based products , juice drinks , and water to students of all grades . <p> Public health officials across the nation have been trying to ban carbonated drinks in school because of the alleged link between soda consumption and childhood obesity . Los Angeles school district , for instance , imposed a ban last year . Coca-Cola 's rules , however , are voluntary . <p> THE NOT-SO-SECRET KEY TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS , say most economists , is the ability to specialize . It accounts , so the theory goes , not only for the variation in economic growth over time but for variation in the economic fortunes of nations and indeed of whole continents . The lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you do well and contract out everything else , say the management gurus . So why is the Postal Service selling art and planning expansion in the face of a declining market for first-class letter mail ? Earlier this year , the President 's Commission on the Postal Service issued its recommendations for postal reform ; unfortunately for the Postal Service , the commission 's recommendations make economic sense : the Postal Service should not expand . Instead , says the commission , its monopoly powers should be reviewed regularly and repealed as appropriate ; it should be subject to all of the financial disclosure rules that apply to private firms ; any rate increases should be held to less than the rate of inflation ; its workforce should be reduced over time ; the pay of postal employees should be brought into line with that of comparable workers in the private sector , and the Postal Service should not be allowed to subsidize some postal products with revenue from other postal products ( favoring some types of mailers at the expense of others ) . <p> Recently , Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the commission . He says its recommendations are " sweeping and substantial " and " particularly useful . " He notes , though , that the board  --  perhaps somewhat pragmatically  --  stopped short of recommending privatization . Without investor-owners , however , it is not clear to whom a proposed Postal Review Board would be accountable , or that it would have a strong incentive to hold rates down and require the Post Office to achieve efficiencies . Geddes asks : " What can the PRB do when the Postal Service states that it must have higher rates to make payroll , as it did in the 1994 rate case ?
