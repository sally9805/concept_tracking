CLONAID(TM) says that five cloned human babies have now been born . Dolly the cloned sheep died on February 14th this year at the age of 6 1/2 . The time seems right to bring back this short-short from 1978 to remind us all that some things never change . For those of you who do n't know his work , Bill Pronzini is one of Barry Malzberg 's most frequent collaborators ; together they have published three dozen stories and novels . Mr. Pronzini 's solo fiction tends to fall in the mystery and suspense genres . His most recent novel , Spook , is his twenty-eighth novel featuring the nameless detective . <p> " I 'M SORRY , " THE LOVELY blond said to Lapham , " but I could never invite a man into my Home Complex that I do n't really know . But thanks anyway for an interesting evening . " And she shut the door firmly in his face . Lapham was very tired of women telling him they did n't invite a man into their Home Complex that they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut in his face . It was 2172 , a new era in interpersonal communication , was n't it ? And he was actually a fairly decent-looking man , was n't he ? Not to mention being a fairly successful pocket deity to many of the Aphid Chorae of Ceres , and having a number of good qualities which included but were not limited to earnestness , honesty , punctuality , and never squeezing his pimples in public . Or taking the bandages off his radiation scars . For some reason , however , women did not seem to like him . So Lapham , in desperation , finally went to the Cloning Foundation and applied for Opposite Gender Replication . He would create the woman who would understand him , so there . Opposite Gender Replication was a recent innovation of the Foundation , and having been established only within the most recent decade and having been made available at terrific expense to people such as Lapham who had reasons to need an understanding ear from those of a different genital persuasion . Lapham permitted his blood to be typed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be charted , his persona to be electromagnetically shocked and his private parts to be fondled in an unseemly fashion . His facial bandages , however , were left respectfully in place by the personnel of the enormously expensive Cloning Foundation . ( He had inherited three-quarters of the asteroid Ceres , which made his lot somewhat easier . ) At the end of this painful and somewhat unprintable process , a pure cell of his was extracted and left to lie in the darkest and most cherished spaces of the Foundation 's nethermost level . Lapham waited for eighteen years . Eighteen years was then as now the age of legal majority and he did not wish to be indicted for statutory rape , even of himself . The years sped by . Lapham invented a cheap substitute for the wheel , and after patenting it , rode it all the way to Proxima Centauri and back . Bored , he created sub-life in one of the testing arenas and fed it to the grateful Aphid Chorae . He waited patiently , amusing himself through all the empty little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , through all of this , deal with women at all . He was saving himself for herself . At precisely oh eight hundred hours on her eighteenth birthday , the pimply blonde clone said , " I 'm sorry , but I never invite a man into my Home Complex that I do n't really know . But thanks anyway for an interesting evening . " And Lapham shut the door firmly in Lapham 's face .
