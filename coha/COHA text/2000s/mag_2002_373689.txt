In the history of Madonna/whore complexes , no one has accomplished as much in 61 minutes as Xzibit has on his wobbly fourth album , Man Vs . Machine . On the exuberantly lascivious Choke Me , Spank Me ( Pull My Hair ) Xzibit is as straightforward as his title  --  a night with him is not about cuddling , ladies  --  while on Missin ' U he tells his dear , departed mother , " What I would n't give for one more day with you . " Xzibit claims this contradiction is part of an allegory ( Man Vs . Machine is apparently a concept album about the difficulty of maintaining both underground and mainstream success ) , but it 's an allegory out of control . The nasty stuff sounds like the usual hard-core crassness , while the nice stuff comes off as treacly . The shame is that Xzibit wastes contributions from guests Eminem and Snoop Dogg and flavorful production from , among others , Dr. Dre.  --  By Josh Tyrangiel <P> After winning her independence from an overeager stage dad , country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album as an adult would reveal her true personality . On Twisted Angel we learn that the real LeAnn Rimes is actually Paula Abdul . The first single , Life Goes On , is passable pop in which Rimes uses her considerable range to overcome dated slang like " daddy mack . " The rest of the album is a catastrophe . The songs are poorly written hip-hop/pop hybrids with production so gaudy you 'll yearn for the organic sound of a Cher record . And unless your name is R.Kelly , you 'll squirm as Rimes marries sex and cliche ( " You opened up my world to paradise , so nice ! /Feels so good , my body liquefies " ) . Rimes is not a girl , not yet a woman  --  and definitely not yet a songwriter.  --  J.T. <P> It 's too late in tom petty 's career for him to monkey with his sound , and on The Last DJ , Petty 's 14th album , he remains a committed minimalist , letting jangly guitars , floating keyboards and his much imitated whine rule the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and The Last DJ contains his most interesting and confident material in a decade . As ever , there are small-time characters with big-time regrets , but whereas previous Petty protagonists had no one to blame but themselves , many of these losers are paralyzed by the grip of corporate culture . On Money Becomes King , he rasps , " If you stretch your imagination , I 'll tell you all a tale/About a time when everything was n't up for sale , " while on the title track he curses the end of creative choice over the airwaves . It 's not a protest song but an elegy  --  one that deserves lots of play over those dying airwaves .  --  J.T.
