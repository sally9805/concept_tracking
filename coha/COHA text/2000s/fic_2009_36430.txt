If Ann-Victoria Hadley had been forced to tell the truth  --  and she never had to be forced ; she always told the truth  --  she would have had to admit that this was not the first time she had been the most hated person in Snow Hill , Pennsylvania . In fact , for most of her ninety-one years , she had made something of a hobby of it . It had started in 1926 , when she was ten . That was the first and last time she had ever entered the Snow Hill Historical Society 's annual Fourth of July Essay Contest . The winner of the contest got to read her essay from the reviewing stand at the end of the Fourth of July parade . <p> <p> " Right in front of everybody ! " Annie-Vic 's fifth-grade teacher had said , as if that was the most important thing in the world  --  doing whatever you did " right in front of everybody . " The teacher was old Miss Encander , a creaking wreck of medical problems held together by nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the time , that everybody in Snow Hill was held together by smugness , and that not even the oppressive June heat that always accompanied the last week of school could excuse Miss Encander for requiring her class to enter that contest . Besides , it was n't fair . In elementary school , the hill kids were still mixed in with the kids from the town . They sat at the back of the classroom in stolid , silent rows and stared at their hands if the teacher called on them . The essay that won the contest was always called something like " Today We Thank Our Founding Fathers . " What did the hill kids have to be thankful for ? There was no plumbing up there in those shacks , and no electricity either , and once or twice a year one of the men died from drinking the stuff they made in a still they kept out of sight in an abandoned mine . <p> <p> " It 's better when they die , " Annie-Vic 's father had said , at the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse when they go blind or crazy and there 's nothing you can do for them . " <p> <p> Annie-Vic 's father was the one " real " doctor in town , but he had wanted to be a lawyer . Then his older brother Thomas had decided to be a lawyer himself , and their father , Annie-Vic 's Grampa Hay , had decided that there was n't enough room for two lawyers in Snow Hill . <p> <p> " It would never have occurred to him that I could pack up and move away and be a lawyer somewhere else , " Annie-Vic 's father said . " It never even occurred to me . " <p> <p> Annie-Vic called her essay " Patriotism , " and that was accurate . It was an essay about patriotism . Mostly , it was an essay about why patriotism was bad for you , and why they should give up celebrating the Fourth of July until they 'd cleaned up everything that was wrong with the country . Annie-Vic had mentioned the hill kids , but she had also mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more advanced in Europe . That was why old Miss Encander had ended up calling her not just a Communist , but a snob . <p> <p> These days , people were calling Annie-Vic an atheist , or  --  worse yet , in the eyes of most of them  --  a secular humanist . Annie-Vic had never heard the term before all this fuss started , and she 'd ended up having to look it up on the Internet . Annie-Vic had a cable Internet connection on her computer at home and a wireless card in her laptop , for when she was traveling . She did a lot of traveling . Her last trip had been just last July , to Mongolia , to see a total eclipse of the sun . She had gone with an AAVC tour group and had her picture taken with her arms around a yak . <p> <p> " Asinine , " Annie-Vic thought now , looking down the long straight line of Main Street . She was thinking of the now , of course , but she was also thinking of that long-ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could have written a much more insulting essay . She could have written one entitled " Snow Hill , Pennsylvania , The Town with the Stupidest People in the World , " or " Miss Encander Should Learn Something Before She Tries to Teach It . " It was a testament to Annie-Vic 's mother that Annie-Vic could never force herself to be that rude . <p> <p> Main Street had stores on it  --  and churches . There were half a dozen churches , even though Snow Hill was a small place . The churches were not the same ones Annie-Vic remembered from her childhood . The buildings were the same  --  except for the Holiness Church , which was new , and all the way at the end of the street  --  but the denominations in them had switched around . The Congregationalists were gone . They had become the United Church of Christ and then just sort of disappeared . Their building had been taken over by the Assembly of God . The Baptists had moved into the church that had once belonged to the Episcopalians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to the Baptist 's old building . Only the Lutherans had stayed where they 'd started out , and almost nobody went to the Lutherans anymore . <p> <p> Annie-Vic leaned over and checked the laces on her running shoes . She did not run  --  she was ninety-one , and she had n't even liked to run when she was at Vassar ; it was a new thing , this driving need to race about everywhere and be athletic  --  but she did walk every day , up and down Main Street if she were in town . In Mongolia she had not walked because she had hiked every day with her group , but on another AAVC trip , to China , she had risen every morning and paced three or four times around her hotel . The Chinese police were not happy with the idea of an American walking around the streets on her own , for what looked to be no reason of any kind at all . <p> <p> There were people on Main Street who were waiting for her and Annie-Vic knew it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her first vacation from college . In those days it was strange for a girl to go to college at all . It was an affront that a girl would go away to a place like Vassar , which was for people who were richer than the Hadleys were , for people who were not Folks . It was important to almost everybody in Snow Hill to be Just Folks . Annie-Vic had always wondered if they had waited for her on Main Street when they found out that she was n't coming home after college , that she had enlisted in the Navy instead . That was in 1937 , and four short years later America was at war . That time , Annie-Vic had managed to stay away for damned near a decade . She still thought of it as the happiest time of her life , in spite of the fact that she 'd spent two years of it in a Japanese prisoner of war camp . <p> <p> " Asinine , " she said again . Then she started off down the sidewalk , moving more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have managed , staring straight ahead as she did . The people who were waiting for her were not going to slow her down , or change her mind . If they were n't all boneheaded stupid , they 'd know it . <p> <p> The first stretch of Main Street was clear of people . It was a working day in the middle of the week , and most of the people who lived in Snow Hill were away at jobs in Harrisburg . Yes , Annie-Vic thought , even Snow Hill was changing . Even Snow Hill could n't stay stuck in the mud of provincial ignorance forever , although it sure as Hell intended to try . Annie-Vic was an imposing figure , and she knew it . She was tall for a woman , even these days , and so spare she could have served as a flagpole with very little alteration . Her arms and legs pumped , the way she had been taught to make them in the cardiovascular health class she 'd taken at the community college . Her hair was thick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cataracts and in no need of glasses except when she wanted to read . Her spine was as straight as a metal rod . <p> <p> " Use it or lose it , " she whispered to herself , under her breath . <p> <p> That was just the moment she was coming up on the Snow Hill Diner , and on Alice McGuffie , standing right outside . <p> <p> " Filthy little bitch , " Alice McGuffie said , in a voice loud enough to carry all up and down the street .
