Haji Zahir is one of three local commanders intent on winning the $25 million bounty on Osama bin Laden . Accompanying Zahir 's fighters on their hunt , I rummaged through what was probably the last of bin Laden 's training camps in Afghanistan . It was in the Milawa Valley section of Tora Bora , in the shadow of the majestic White Mountains . Just below it lie a series of man-made caves stuffed with arms and weapons , while above it is a ridge with more caves where bin Laden was thought to be hiding . <P> Strewn across the terraced slopes that climb the valley were torn strips of Arabic training manuals , bits of a Chinese-Arabic dictionary , some shreds of clothing , a set of parallel exercise bars and a shooting target printed by the National Rifle Association . Trees blown from the earth lay with their roots twisted into clumps like charred driftwood . Bomb craters 50 ft. across and 20 ft. deep were filled with rubble and crossbeams . That the caves still existed was a wonder . They had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge inside the caves would have survived the sorties . <P> The caves were n't five-star accommodations with internal hydroelectric power plants and brick-lined walls  --  the kind sometimes imagined in the computer-generated images of the press . Such commodious quarters might exist higher in the White Mountains , but the ones I saw were simply rough bunkers . <P> Bin Laden , his wives and and 13 children first moved to this part of Afghanistan in 1996 , after being thrown out of Sudan . The network of man-made caves , which the Russians had found impenetrable during their disastrous occupation of Afghanistan , was the perfect place to wage war but a rotten place to raise a family . There were no " facilities , " bin Laden complained to his host , the warlord of the nearby city of Jalalabad . Bin Laden later moved into a compound in Jalalabad that had internal plumbing . <P> Still , the caves are a remarkable refuge . I entered my first one by walking through a narrow 20-ft. passage chiseled into a 60degree mountain slope  --  the effect was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stepped over two rows of sandbags that blocked the passage and came to a 3-ft. opening . I ducked into the mouth and dared go no farther . Not even Haji Zahir 's fighters would follow , and several were making boom noises and gesturing about flying body parts . Everybody expected booby traps or mines . <P> After my eyes adjusted to the darkness , I saw a chamber of about 8 sq . ft. , high enough for a tall man to stand . The floor was dirt and rubble , but there were signs of habitation . I saw two empty white boxes decorated with palm trees and the words " Sherjah Dates . " Scattered on the floor were a few green metal boxes of ammunition with Russian writing on them . Another cave next to it was about the same size and filled with ammunition  --  mostly rocket-propelled grenades and bullets for Kalashnikovs . <P> Having taken the territory , Haji Zahir 's men withdrew from the valley , leaving several of their own dead . But that night the al-Qaeda fighters sneaked back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A commander named Anatullah found them a day later as his men carried the bodies out on woven beds . " We are Muslims , you are Muslims , " he recalls the words on the notes . " Do n't fight us . We are waiting for American troops to attack , and then you will see who wins . "
