HOMECOMING <p> The day I returned to Templeton steeped in disgrace , the fifty-foot corpse of a monster surfaced in Lake Glimmerglass . It was one of those strange purple dawns that color July there , when the bowl made by the hills fills with a thick fog and even the songbirds sing timorously , unsure of day or night . <p> The fog was still deep when Dr. Cluny found the monster on his morning row . I imagine how it went : the slide of the scull 's knife across the lake , the oar heads casting rings on the water , the red bow light pulsing into the dark . Then , sudden , looming over the doctor 's shoulder , an island where there had never before been an island , the vast belly of the dead beast . Gliding backward , the old doctor could n't see it . He neared ; the bow-ball of his boat pushed into the rubbery flesh like a finger into a balloon ; the pressure of boat versus skin reached a tensile limit without piercing anything ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern . The doctor turned , but he was prepared only for the possible , and did n't at first know what was before him . When he saw the large and terrible eye still milking over with death , the good doctor blinked . And then he fainted . <p> When Dr. Cluny came to , the dawn had thinned , the water was shot with bars of light , and he found himself rowing around and around the bellied-up beast , weeping . In his mouth there was the sweet burn of horehound candy , the exact savor of his long-ago childhood . Only when a seagull landed upon the flat chin of the leviathan and bent to steal a taste did Dr. Cluny return to himself ; only then did he skid back over the water to the awakening town , shouting his news . <p> " Miracle , " he called . " Miracle . Come , quick , see . " <p> At that precise moment , I was idling in the park across the street from Averell Cottage , my childhood home . For at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression that the town flooded in winter to make a skating rink , gathering what courage I could . The fog veiled my grand , awkward house , with its original cottage from 1793 , one wing from Victorian 1890 , and another from the tasteless 1970s , turning the whole into something more coherent , almost beautiful . In my delirium , I thought I could see my mother inside with a few lifetimes of family antiques and the gentle ghost that lived in my childhood room , all traced like bones on an X-ray , delicate as chalk . <p> I felt the world around me creak and strain , snapping apart , fiber by fiber , like a rope pulled too tautly . <p> Back near Buffalo I had had a glimpse of myself in a rest-stop bathroom , and was horrified to find myself transformed into a stranger in rumpled , dirty clothing , my once-pretty face bloated and red with crying jags . I was drawn , thin , welted with the bites of a thousand Alaskan blackflies . My hair , shorn in April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like some little chick , starving , molting , kicked out of the nest for late-discovered freakishness . <p> As the night thinned around me , I leaned over and retched . And I still had n't moved when , down Lake Street , there came a muffled trampling sound . I knew before I saw them that the sounds were from the Running Buds , a small , dear band of middle-aged men who jog around the streets of Templeton every morning , in all weather , in ice , in rain , in this fine-pelted fog . When the Buds came nearer , I could hear gentle talking , some spitting , some wheezing over their footsteps . They moved out of the dark and into the glow of the single streetlamp on Lake Street , and seeing me in the park in my little depression , seeing , perhaps , something familiar about me but not quite recognizing who I was at that distance , all six of them raised their hands in my direction . I waved back and watched their thick bodies disappear down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heading up the driveway , passing through the garage doorway , and I opened the door to the mudroom to the smells of straw and dust and bitter orange , the smells of home . I almost turned around , returned to the car , waited for day . I had n't seen my mother in more than a year : I could n't afford the trip home , and , for the first time since I 'd left , she had n't offered to pay . Instead , though , I came in as silently as I could , hoping to have a few good hours of sleep before awakening her . I placed my shoes beside her white nursing clogs , and went through the mudroom , then the kitchen . <p> But although I had expected Vi to be sleeping , she was sitting at the kitchen table with the Freeman 's Journal spread before her , her profile reflected in the great plate glass door that looked out over the two-acre lawn , the lake , the hills . She must have had a night shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hot water , her eyes closed , her face hanging above her tea as if she were trying to steam her features off . They were slipping that way , anyhow : at forty-six , my mother had the worn , pouchy skin of a woman who had done far too many drugs at far too young an age . Her shoulders were slumped , and the zipper in the back of her skirt was open , revealing a swatch of red cotton underwear and a muffin-top of flesh above it . <p> From my position in the kitchen door , my mother looked old . If I were n't already holding the pieces together with both squeezed hands , this sight would have broken my heart . <p> I must have moved or swallowed , because Vi turned her head and looked at me . Her eyes narrowed , she blinked and heaved a sigh , and passed a hand over her face . " Goddamn flashbacks , " she muttered . <p> I snorted . <p> She looked at me again , her forehead creasing . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " <p> " Not this time . Apparently , " I said , coming over to her and kissing her on the part in her hair . She smelled antiseptic from the hospital , but , deeper , there was her own smell , something birdlike , like warm and dusty wings . She squeezed my hand , flushing . <p> " You look horrible . What in the world are you doing home ? " she said . <p> " Oh boy . " I sighed , and had to look away , at the thinning curls of fog on the lake . When I looked back , the smile had fallen off her face . <p> " What . The heck . Are you . Doing home ? " she said , again , still squeezing , but harder with each word until the bones in my hand were crushing one another . <p> " Jesus , " I gasped . <p> " Well , " she said , " if you 're in trouble , you 'd better be praying . " It was only then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung heavily between her breasts , as if my mother had gone to the Farmers ' Museum up the road and blacksmithed her own crucifix out of two hobnails . I nudged the cross with my free hand and frowned . <p> " Vi ? " I said . " Oh do n't tell me you 've become a Jesus freak . You 're a hippie , for God 's sake . Remember ? Organized religion equals bad ? " <p> She released my hand , and tugged the cross away . " That , " she said , " is none of your business . " For a long moment , though , Vi could n't look at me . <p> " Vi , " I said , " be serious . What 's going on ? " <p> My mother sighed and said , " People change , Willie . " <p> " You do n't , " I said . <p> " You should be glad I do , " she said . She dropped her eyes , not yet remembering that I was standing there in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Alaskan tundra . I should have been blowing lichen off definitive proof that human culture existed there over thirty-five thousand years ago , some incisor embedded deep in the ground , some tool still glistening with seal grease , intact from the deep freezer of the steppe . I should have been under the aegis of Dr. Primus Dwyer , PhD , Delano Professor in the Sciences at Stanford University , where in a few short months I was supposed to finish my PhD dissertation , and graduate , heading toward a life of impossible luminescence . <p> When I told my mother in my sophomore year that I wanted to focus my furious ambitions in archaeology , she looked bitterly disappointed for a moment . " Oh , Willie , " she 'd said then . " There is nothing left in this world for you to discover , honey . Why look backward when you can look forward ? " I talked for hours then , of the intensity of wonder when you blew away the dust and found an ancient skull in your hand , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by long-dead hands . Like so many people who have long ago burnt through all of their own passion , my mother recognized mine , and longed for it . Archaeology would take me into the great world , into deserts and tundras , as far away from Templeton as I believed she had always wanted me to be . By now , her ego and a good portion of what inheritance she had left were invested in this dream : me as intrepid explorer of bone and potsherds , tunneling into the vastness of prehistory . Now , in the lightening dawn , she looked at me . A motorboat was speeding across the lake at top throttle , and its whine rose even to us , set two acres back on glowing , overgrown lawn . <p> " Oh , Willie , " said my mother now . " Are you in trouble , " and it was a statement , not a question . <p> " Vi ? " I said . " I messed up big-time . " <p> " Of course , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You can hardly stand to come back once a year for Christmas . " <p> " Goddamn it , Vi , " I said , and I sat down in one of the kitchen chairs and rested my head on the table . <p> My mother looked at me and then sighed . " Willie , " she said . " I 'm sorry . I 'm so tired . Tell me now what happened so I can get some sleep , and we 'll deal with it later . " <p> I looked at her , then had to look down at the table . I traced designs in the waxy residue of its surface . And then I told her one version of the story , vastly abridged . <p> " Well , Vi , " I said . " It looks like I 'm pregnant . And it 's maybe Dr. Primus Dwyer 's . " <p> My mother held her fingers over her mouth . " Oh , heaven help us , " she said . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said it in one exhale , in a great whoosh . I told her that I also tried to run over his wife with a bush plane , and she was the dean of students , and it was probable that charges of attempted manslaughter would prevent me from returning to Stanford again . I held my breath and waited for the knuckled sting of the back of her hand . Despite Vi 's hippie mores , it was not uncommon in my childhood for us to get to this point in our battles , panting and narrow-eyed , stalemated across the table . And once or twice , for my greatest sins , she did send her hand across to settle it all with a smack . <p> But she did n't hit me now , and it was so silent I could hear the two-hundred- year-old grandfather clock in the dining room as the pendulum clicked , clicked , clicked . When I looked up , Vi was shaking her head . " I ca n't believe it , " she said , pushing her tea farther from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exceptional , and here you are , a fuckup . Like your stupid fuckup mother . " Her face wobbled and grew red . <p> I tried to touch her arm , but she snatched it away , as if mere contact with me could burn her . " I 'm going to take a few pills , " she said , standing . " I 'm going to sleep for as long as I can sleep . And when I wake up , we 're dealing with this . " She moved heavily to the door . With her back still toward me , she paused . " And oh , Willie , your hair . You had such beautiful hair , " she said and moved away . I could hear her footsteps on every creaking floorboard in the old house , up the grand front stairway , far away over the hall and into the master bedroom . <p> Only in recent years did such coolness arise between Vi and me . When I was little , I would play cribbage and euchre with my young mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the few sleepovers and birthday parties I was invited to . My mother and I held an odd relationship with the town , as we were the last remnants of its founder , Marmaduke Temple , and direct descendants of the great novelist Jacob Franklin Temple , whose novels we read every year in high school , whose link to me would actually make a college professor burst into tears when I confessed it . But we were too poor and my mother was young , unmarried , and too weird with her macramT and loud politics , and so when we left the safety of our eccentric house , it always felt like Vi and me against the world . I remember vividly when I was ten or so-which would have made my mother my age , twenty-eight-listening outside her door as she wept for hours after being slighted in the grocery store , that one memory standing in for many . I dreamt at night of being so big I could march down Main Street , grinding our enemies under my furious ogre 's feet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mother 's tea to melt the block of ice in my gut . Vi was wrong : I did want to come home . Templeton was to me like a less-important limb , something inherently mine , something I took for granted . My own tiny , lovely village with great old mansions and a glorious lake , my own grand little hamlet where everyone knows your name , but with elaborate little frills that made it unlike anywhere else ; the baseball museum , the Opera , the hospital that had vast arms extending into the rest of upstate , an odd mix of Podunk and cosmopolitan . I came back when I had to , to feel safe , to recharge ; I just had n't had to in so long . <p> For a while I sat alone at the table , watching the crows fall into the vegetable garden , pecking at the heirloom vegetables that thrived every year under Vi 's benign neglect . Then the motorboat that had gone out before zipped back , and soon more motorboats were roaring out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid open the glass door and went onto the porch , in the warming dawn . From where I stood , the hills around Lake Glimmerglass looked like the haunch end of a sleeping lion , smooth and pelted . I watched until the motorboats came back into sight , collectively straining to pull something pale behind them , something enormous and glinting in the new sun . <p> And that 's how I found myself running barefoot over the cold grass down to Lakefront Park , even as weary as I was at that moment . I went past our pool , now so thick with algae that it had become a frog pond , plunking with a thousand belly flops of terror when I passed . I went down the stretch of lawn , across the concrete bridge over Shadow Brook , trespassed over Mrs. Harriman 's backyard until I stood in the road at Lakefront Park , and watched the motorboats coast in . <p> I stood under the bronze statue of the Mohican , the best known of the characters by our town novelist , Jacob Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people from my childhood who nodded at me in recognition , startled by the great change in my appearance , struck silent by the solemnity of the moment . Somehow , none of us was surprised . Templeton is a town of accreted myth : that baseball was invented here ; that a petrified giant , ten feet tall and pockmarked with age , was disinterred from under the old mill-a hoax ; that ghosts lived among us . And we had been prepared for this day by the myths we 'd always heard about a lake monster , the childhood tales around campfires in the summer camps on the lake , the small rumors filtered down . The town crazy , Piddle Smalley , would stand on a bench in Farkle Park wearing his pants backward-urine-soaked , which is why we called him Piddle-and shout about the rain-swollen April day when he stood on the Susquehanna bridge , staring down into the fat river , and something immense passed by , grinning its black teeth up at him . He 'd shriek at the end of his story Glimmey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Most of Templeton was watching as the motorboats cut their engines and glided in . The Chief Uncas tourist boat groaned in the waves against the dock . The Running Buds climbed out with great gravitas , old joints creaking , and secured the beast 's tethers to the iron hitches in the walls at the lake 's edge . And in those brief minutes before the baseball tourists in town heard of our miracle and came running with their vulgar cameras and shouts and poses , before the news trucks drove ninety miles per hour from Oneonta , Utica , Albany , there , in the long , peaceful quiet , we had a few moments to consider our monster . <p> In that brief time , we were able to see it in its entirety . The beast was huge , a heavy cream color that darkened to lemon in places , and was floating on its back . It looked like a carp grown enormous , with a carp 's fat belly and round eye , but with a long , articulated neck like a ballet dancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog 's . The ropes of the motorboat had cut into its skin , and the wounds were open to the day , still oozing dark , thick blood . I stepped forward to touch the beast , then everyone else did . When I placed my hand upon its belly , I felt its porous skin , its hairs as small and delicate as the ones on my own arms , but thicker , as if the beast were covered in peach fuzz . And , though I had expected the early sun to have warmed it , the monster burned cold , as if its very core was made of the ice some said still existed at the bottom of our glacial lake . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
