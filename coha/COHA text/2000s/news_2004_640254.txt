<p> Developers of a proposed Indian casino near Denver would pocket a significant share of the casino 's revenues during its first 12 years of operation , according to the executive spearheading the project . <p> Developers would receive 39 percent of the casino 's net revenues during the first six years and 29 percent over the six subsequent years , said Steve Hillard , chief executive of Council Tree Communications , the Golden-based investment firm financing the project . <p> The so-called ' Homecoming Project ' was launched to help the economically depressed Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma , which are seeking to trade a claim to 27 million acres of land in Colorado for 500 acres near Denver , where the casino would be built . <p> The tribes would receive the rest of the casino 's net revenues , Hillard said , citing a development agreement finalized in October . After 12 years of operation , the tribes would receive all of the casino 's profits , he said . <p> Council Tree 's team of investors , which includes four Alaska native-owned corporations and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Native American Land Group to develop the $ 150 million casino . <p> The cost of building the casino would be repaid with casino revenues within 10 years , Hillard said . <p> Hillard disclosed financial details of the development agreement after The Denver Post obtained a copy of an earlier pact between the Native American Land Group and the tribes dated June 21 . <p> Hillard would n't provide The Post with a copy of the October agreement , saying it contains proprietary information . <p> Under the June contract , which Hillard said is invalid , the developers would have garnered a cut of the revenues before operating costs were deducted . <p> The June contract stipulated that developers receive 15 percent of the casino 's gross revenues during the first 36 months of operation and 18 percent each month thereafter for no more than 12 years . <p> Gross revenues are n't adjusted for operating costs , such as payroll and equipment fees , and other expenses , such as state taxes . Those costs are deducted from the gross revenue to produce the net revenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net revenues instead of the gross after the tribes asked them to ' stand up shoulder to shoulder with them . ' <p> ' Everyone 's got an interest in maximizing the bottom line , ' he said . <p> The June agreement also allowed developers to terminate the contract if a site for the casino is n't acquired within 12 months and if the casino is n't opened within 30 months . Hillard said the October agreement changed those provisions to 24 months and 60 months , respectively . <p> Hillard said Council Tree is spending about $ 1 million to get the project off the ground - an investment that wo n't be reimbursed . <p> The casino is expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in profits for the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes , much-needed funds for the 11,191 tribal members whose per capita annual income is $ 8,011 , Hillard said . <p> H. Fabian Ramirez , an Indian gaming analyst with Fitch Ratings , said most Indian casinos are ' very lucrative . ' <p> ' All of the tribal casinos we have looked at have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian casino in Colorado still faces several obstacles , including opposition from top state officials . <p> Gov . Bill Owens , who must sign off on any tribal casino agreement , is opposed to a casino on the plains . <p> One version of the project has placed it on a site near Denver International Airport , where casino gambling is not permitted by law . The tribes have also expressed interest in a site in Central City , which has had casinos since 1991 . <p> Hillard said the tribes would prefer to build the casino on the plains east of Denver . <p> Owens spokesman Dan Hopkins said that the governor will not bow to the pressure of the tribes ' formal land claim . <p> ' He 's going to do what 's right for Colorado , ' Hopkins said . <p> Hillard said the tribes are aware of Owens ' objection to the expansion of gambling outside the areas of the state where it is currently allowed . The tribes , he said , are willing to negotiate . <p> ' As we go into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . a We recognize that Gov . Bill Owens is not interested in an expansion of gaming but is open to a dialogue within existing venues , ' Hillard said . <p> There also is uncertainty within the tribes themselves about the project . Chief Laird Cometsevah , an elder living in Oklahoma and an outspoken activist for Indian rights , says he is n't sure the Colorado casino would be helpful , because tribal infighting is keeping revenues from two existing tribal casinos in the tribes ' own backyard from from being distributed equitably to tribal members . <p> At a news conference April 14 announcing the land claim , one tribal official initially conceded that there were ' mistakes ' in handling the money from one Oklahoma casino , but added that the tribe was learning from the errors . Another official , however , said during the same news conference that there were no mistakes . <p> Another obstacle the tribes face is that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has never approved a tribal casino outside of the state where the tribe resides . The bureau has rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bureau spokesman said . Such claims are a fairly new phenomenon . <p> ' I think that is a hurdle we can jump over , ' Hillard said . <p> Hillard denied that the tribes ' land petition would open the door for similar claims by the 38 other Indian tribes that also were forcibly removed from their homelands to Oklahoma beginning in the 1800s . <p> There are more than 569 federally recognized Indian tribes in 35 states . The Department of Justice says more than 600 claims against the United States have been filed by Native American tribes and pueblos under the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946 . <p> The last , pursued for more than 50 years by the San Ildefonso Pueblo of New Mexico , was resolved in 2002 . The government agreed to pay the pueblo $ 6.9 million and allow it to purchase 7,700 acres of Santa Fe National Forest . <p> The leverage tribes have when they file land claims is that the doctrine of adverse possession - which allows an entity to take possession of land simply by using it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Nelson , a lawyer who specializes in Native American law with the Denver firm Brega &; Winters . <p> ' With regard to Indian tribes , since they 're deemed to be sovereign governmental entities , that does n't run , ' Nelson said . ' So the fact that there 's been somebody on a parcel for hundreds of years does n't necessarily mean that their claim is extinguished . ' <p> Hillard said he expects to ' move relatively quickly to formulate a settlement . ' <p> Hillard 's group of investors include Arctic Slope Regional Corp. , a $ 1 billion-a-year corporation owned by Alaskan natives . The corporation , known as ASRC , has 11 subsidiaries and 35 operating companies . Other investors include Catalyst Investors , a unit of Denver-based investment bank Daniels &; Associates , and Toronto-based TD Financial Group . <p> An activist Native American shareholder in ASRC questions the wisdom of using the corporation 's money to finance a casino in Colorado , which is more than 8,200 miles from shareholders ' homes around Barrow , Alaska . <p> ' This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said David Maasak Leavitt Jr. , one of three shareholder activists who recently collected thousands of signatures on a petition calling for a special meeting of the corporate board with the shareholders . <p> In addition to questioning the Denver casino investment , the activists plan to ask why shareholders receive what they call a ' pittance ' from the corporation and to seek a voice in board activities . The corporation agreed to meet with irate shareholders in Barrow in May , activist Beverly Grinage confirmed . <p> Conrad Bagne , chief operating officer for ASRC and contact person for Native American Land Group , said the corporation does n't plan to pick up the entire tab for the Homecoming Project . ' I can comfortably say ASRC is not investing $ 100 million or $ 150 million on its own , ' he said . <p> He said that regardless of the casino 's distance from Alaska , shareholders will reap benefits , including return on capital , which can be used to pay dividends to shareholders . <p> An ASRC subsidiary , ASCG Inc. , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $ 300 million tribal casino and resort complex proposal along Oregon 's Columbia River Gorge and the existing Camel Rock Casino north of Santa Fe . <p> Bagne said the firm is not currently in the casino business and provided only design services to those projects . The Oregon and New Mexico casinos ' could have been hotels , casinos or car washes , ' he said . <p> In March , lawmakers in the Colorado House of Representatives passed a resolution calling for Indian casinos that might be built in Colorado by out-of-state tribes to abide by state rules and regulations on gambling . <p> Supporters of the resolution feared the tribes will seek to operate their new casino under tribal rules instead of Colorado 's , leaving the state 's existing 42 casinos at a competitive disadvantage . <p> When asked if the tribes would abide by Colorado laws , Hillard replied : " That is exclusively a matter for good faith negotiations between the state and the tribes .
