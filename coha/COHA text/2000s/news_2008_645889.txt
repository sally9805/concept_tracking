RATING : WILD APPLAUSE Drama . Starring Sean Penn , James Franco and Josh Brolin . Directed by Gus Van Sant . <p> With " Milk , " a great San Francisco story becomes a great American story . <p> Director Gus Van Sant uses the account of one of the country 's first openly gay public officials , who was assassinated in 1978 , to invest the gay rights movement with mythic grandeur , as a successor to all the heroic social protest movements in American history . Van Sant 's point of view may be a matter of politics , outside the scope of a review , but his success in putting over his point of view is a question of art . <p> His success is complete . His shaping of the material is seamless , and the images he evokes are inspiring . <p> At the center of everything is Sean Penn , who disappears into the title role . Gone are his familiar facial expressions . Gone are the pursed lips and the covered , compressed quality . He has Harvey Milk 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the public arena - the physical resemblance is uncanny . But what 's more striking is the spiritual transformation . Penn gives us a man who was once closeted and now , as if in response , lives his life completely in the open . He 's spontaneous as Penn has never been spontaneous . He 's emotional , vulnerable and generous with his laughter . Penn plays him as an utterly liberated man , and this liberates Penn as an actor . <p> Milk 's openness , which makes him an endearing figure , gives the movie latitude to paint a complex portrait without losing the audience 's interest or affection . The Milk who emerges is at times vain and frivolous . His personal life is often messy and sometimes downright farcical , and his Machiavellian streak is n't becoming , even if impressive . He 's no saint , but he has courage and self-knowledge , and you get the feeling that both qualities were hard earned . Van Sant 's Milk is essentially an average man who gets the call . By chance , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and location , Harvey Milk , in the 1970s , finds himself to be the one person best suited to lead the gay rights movement . <p> The movie begins with him in 1978 , making a tape recording to be played in the event of his assassination . We then flash back to 1970 , when Milk , at 40 years old , decides to throw off his closeted life and move from New York to San Francisco with his new lover , Scott Smith James Franco . <p> Van Sant mixes archival footage with new footage - at times , it 's impossible to tell one from the other - and it 's fascinating to see San Francisco in the ' 70s . There 's color and beauty , but also coarseness ; excitement and hope , but with a feeling that something - or everything - just might spin out of control . The depiction looks accurate , but maybe it looks that way only to people , like me , who never saw San Francisco in that era . No matter . Van Sant captures something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legend . <p> By the time he arrives in San Francisco , Milk looks like a hippie , but he 's an old hippie with non-hippie talents , such as a gift for organization and a head for business . He buys a camera shop , and soon his store becomes a community hangout . Before anyone else does , Milk realizes the potential clout of the gay community . He becomes the guy people go to when they get beaten up by the police . He becomes the guy the Teamsters talk to when they want the gay community on their side . A generation ago , it apparently was n't that easy being gay in San Francisco , but Milk realizes the way out of the darkness : He understands that mainstream acceptance will come not through hiding and assimilation but through people being openly and unapologetically themselves . <p> " Milk " contains a second remarkable performance unless you also count James Franco 's , for looking totally OK about having Sean Penn kissing him like he means it . As Supervisor Dan White , who ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chilling study in weakness . White 's intelligence is limited . His self-conception is rigid and inaccurate . His anger is unspecific but towering , and he might be gay , though his homosexuality could be hidden even from himself . Brolin lets us see White 's thought processes , which are slow and easily derailed by self-protective anger . Last month , Brolin played George W. Bush in " W. " This week he 's Dan White . He must wonder sometimes what casting directors are reading into him . <p> Van Sant 's goal in " Milk " is to give the gay rights movement the grandness and impact of the civil rights movement . To do that , Milk must be made into the gay equivalent of Martin Luther King Jr. , who led a moral crusade , fully knowing that he might be murdered along the way . <p> In truth , the King comparison only goes so far . Yes , Milk led a crusade that involved physical risk , and the real Harvey Milk did make tapes in 1977 to be played in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to say Milk was killed because he was gay . His death was more like a fluke , part of a macabre workplace crime that also robbed the city of its mayor . It 's evidence of the film 's effectiveness , its power to incite emotion , that Milk 's death is made to feel like the inevitable consequence of his being a visionary . <p> One truth " Milk " does n't need to amplify or manipulate : It 's that Harvey Milk 's story is part of the San Francisco story , and that story still means something , even to those who came to town years later and never heard of Milk until they got here . Van Sant 's images of the candle-lit procession in the aftermath of Milk 's death , of the tens of thousands filling Castro Street , are as moving as anything on this year 's screen . Those images will mean the same everywhere - that there 's something in the American soul that makes people want to come together and that makes progress unstoppable . <p> Find Documents with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
