<p> ATLANTA  --  Mention the name Roger McDowell to Atlanta Braves pitching ace Tim Hudson , and a smile creases his face . A clown image dances through his mind . <p> " When he played , he had that clown reputation , " Hudson says . " There were a lot of guys like that , but he stood out . As a pitching coach , he 's going to be awesome . He 's personable , easygoing , and he seems excited to be here . It will be good . We do n't need to work all the time . " <p> For the first time since 1990 , the Braves will have a new pitching coach . Old-school Leo Mazzone , who rocked on the bench as he watched Braves pitchers finish first or second for baseball 's lowest earned run average in 12 of 14 seasons , left for the Baltimore Orioles . <p> He was replaced by minor league pitching coach McDowell , once a sinkerball pitcher and super prankster with the New York Mets who took pleasure in setting hotfoots on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing oversized ears and a pig 's nose to the bullpen . <p> But when the Braves pitchers and catchers report to their Disney World spring training site Thursday , McDowell , 45 , will play down his inner prankster and concentrate on learning about Atlanta 's veteran starting pitchers and the young bullpen . <p> It 'll be quite a contrast to the pitcher who climbed out of the Wrigley Field bullpen to watch a couple of innings alongside the bleacher bums and who wore his shirt as his pants and his pants as his shirt  --  giving the impression he walked on his hands  --  to a dugout of laughter in Los Angeles . <p> " He 'll get a lot of respect as a coach because he 'll burn your shoe off if you do n't do what he says , " says Howard Johnson , McDowell 's former teammate and a minor league batting coach in the Mets organization . Seriously , " He 's going to be a great coach because he 's a fun and likable guy . " <p> Instead of stump arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a graying crew cut is filled with binders of statistical pitching charts . <p> " I would n't take back anything that I have done because it 's who I am . I like to make people laugh , " McDowell says . " But I 'm not a player anymore . I 'm a coach , and it 's a different job . I want to do my job , and that 's to get 11 or 12 pitchers ready to pitch a game . " <p> General manager John Schuerholz wanted to hire someone who shared the Braves ' philosophy that strong pitching wins championships ; he compiled a list of 20 candidates to interview . But he kept hearing positive recommendations about McDowell and made him the first to be interviewed  --  and virtually the last . <p> After a five-hour session , " We almost thought there was no need to interview anyone else , " Schuerholz said . " When you have a Hall of Fame manager say , ' I really like this guy , ' you listen . " <p> That manager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and variety of experiences : " He 's been a starter , middle reliever and closer . He 's had a sore arm and a couple of surgeries ( to his elbow and shoulder ) , so he 's been through a lot . " <p> A leader emerges <p> Jerry Royster , manager of the Las Vegas 51s , the Class AAA affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers where McDowell worked as a pitching coach the last two seasons , says McDowell has grown up and he 's an " extremely good " coach . <p> " That jokester stuff , you do n't see much any more , " Royster says . " There are things we all did in the ' 70s and ' 80s I hope we are n't doing any more . He 's going to make life easy for Bobby Cox because as need arises for the pitchers , he 'll be on top of it . " <p> McDowell was a sinker-slider pitcher with five teams from 1985-96 , pitched in three postseason series and has career totals of 159 saves and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mets against the Houston Astros in Game 6 of the 1986 National League Championship Series to get New York into the World Series and then helped them win it all . <p> He is in pinch-me mode to be wearing the Braves ' logo . Last week , when pitchers worked out at Atlanta 's Turner Field during a minicamp that used to be named " Camp Leo , " McDowell was so jazzed , he was up at 5 a.m. the first day and could n't get back to sleep . <p> " Obviously , this is exciting , " McDowell says . " It 's special . No , make that real special , given the history of this organization with its pitching and all the winning . There are a lot of good pitchers here . And how many consecutive division titles have they won ? Fourteen . " <p> What will he do if the pitchers turn some pranks ? McDowell points to Cox 's office , saying that question has to be answered by the boss . <p> Cox says he wants his team to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotfoots  --  but his biggest concern is for McDowell to remain true to himself , not try to change his personality . He wants McDowell to have the freedom he needs . <p> " Let leaders lead , " Cox says . " It 's a long season , so you have to have fun . I 've liked Roger since Day 1 . I 'm not worried about him . I think he 's going to do a great job . We 're happy to have him . He came out of nowhere for us . " <p> Did he ever . <p> Eight days after Mazzone left to join his friend , Orioles manager Sam Perlozzo  --  for three years and $1.5million , the game 's highest-paid pitching coach  --  the Braves hired McDowell . <p> McDowell , who grew up a Tom Seaver fan in Cincinnati and lives in Palm Springs , Calif. , was with his wife , Gloria , and their daughters , Amanda , 7 , and Rachel , 4 , eating funnel cakes at a county fair in Southern California when Schuerholz called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better part of a millisecond to accept , " McDowell says . " It was Oct.29 , a Saturday , at 11:10 a.m . But not that I remember anything about it . " <p> A young bullpen to shepherd <p> Braves pitchers are impressed with McDowell and particularly like that he pitched in the big leagues . Mazzone was a minor league pitcher for eight seasons who never made it to the majors . He worked for years in the minors as a pitching coach and manager . <p> Atlanta 's staff says a good coach is someone who gets to know the players ' mechanics and pitches well enough to offer them advice when things are going bad . <p> " He should be a combination of a pitching coach , psychologist and friend , " says Hudson , who has won 106 games in seven seasons , including 14 with the Braves last year . " A pitching coach is someone who gives you confidence on the mental side of the game . " <p> Mazzone is known for his intensity and fundamentals . He had pitchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were known for having a healthy and strong staff . <p> Hudson says the media make too much out of Mazzone 's departure . At the big-league level , he says , there is n't that much difference between coaches . <p> Kyle Davies , who won seven of 14 starts as a Braves rookie last season , says he feels a connection to McDowell because of his playing career : " He knows what a pitcher goes through day-to-day . He knows his stuff . He 's already been through whatever we 'll face , and he can tell you how he got through it . " <p> As usual , the Braves have a solid rotation , with Hudson and John Smoltz leading the way . McDowell 's challenges will be to straighten out Chris Reitsma , who comes into spring training as the closer after losing the job last season , and to keep the young pitchers in the bullpen moving in the right direction . <p> In a chilly tunnel near the Braves clubhouse at Turner Field , McDowell , wearing a Braves cap and sweats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning on a pitching machine and watching Hudson 's delivery . <p> After the session , the two chat . McDowell asks Hudson about his delivery , philosophy and family . <p> McDowell 's philosophy has n't changed since he was kid . He 's going to preach the importance of throwing strikes and being aggressive . <p> " We do n't always talk baseball , " McDowell says . " I want to know everything about these guys . I feel that if I know them , I can be a better coach .
