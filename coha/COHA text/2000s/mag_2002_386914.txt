R young author 's adventures in lit land . by Troy Patterson Photograph // JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER WALKS OUT OF THE ELEVATOR and up to the door of his Queens apartment , bearing malt liquor and ice cream sandwiches , the makings of an afternoon snack . He juggles his keys , his grocery bag , and the day 's mail-bills , a magazine , a big envelope from his publisher . It is two weeks before the publication date of Foer 's first novel , Everything Is Illuminated , but he 's been the envy of Quality Lit Land since this time last year . In March 2001 , Houghton Mifflin outbid 15 other publishing houses to acquire the book , ponying up roughly half a million dollars . An excerpt in The New Yorker-accompanied by a photo of the author cuddling a pug in a kitschy nightspot  --  promised a formally playful work in which historical inquiry mingles with jokes about dog drool . His agent made translation deals for languages ranging from Finnish to Catalan . And now , opening the envelope , he discovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , early April , and Foer has just turned 25 . As he unlocks his door , he sings in the style of a certain toy-store jingle , " Wel-come to my world . Wel-come to my world . " EVERYTHING STARTED WHILE Foer was an undergraduate at Princeton , where he I majored in philosophy , took a shine to art history , and racked up creative writing prizes . The summer after his junior year , he took a trip through the Ukraine searching for the woman who , family lore had it , rescued his maternal grandfather from the Nazis . ( His mother , who works in PR , and his father , who runs a think tank , raised him in Washington , D.C. ) He 'd hoped to write an account of his findings . " I found nothing , " he says . He 's sitting on a sofa in his Jackson Heights living room , a 40-ounce bottle of Colt 45 in hand . " The nothing that I found was absolute and complete . There was no question , really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could imagine something , or it would be nothing . " He wrote for two months , and rewrote for more than two years , devising a tale which interweaves a fantastical history of his grandfather 's shtetl with the often slapstick quest of one Jonathan Safran Foer and his young , English-butchering Ukrainian translator . The choice to insert a fictional self in the story was not a choice at all . " It was never something I thought about , " he says . " It 's like when we were walking into my apartment : If you were to say to me , Why did you choose that key ? ' I did n't choose . This is the key that gets me in the apartment . " IN THE TWO-BEDROOM FOER SHARES WITH A ROOMMATE , FAT stacks of art books abound . He sits between a wall of classics  --  crammed bookshelves and a wall crowded with friends ' art and a dozen framed sheets of blank paper . As Foer explains , gesturing with his Chipwich , he lucked into possession of a sheet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bashevis Singer : " In our most romantic world , we think it 's what he would have used had he written another page . I got very into this , so I wrote to writers asking them for their next sheet . " The graph paper is from Paul Auster . The folded scrap is from Joyce Carol Oates . // A couple of the donors to this museum of the unwritten contributed to Foer 's first book , last year 's anthology A Convergence of Birds . He edited the collection of riffs on the artist Joseph Cornell while revising the novel and paying the bills as , among other things , a receptionist , a tutor , and a ghostwriter ( " I turned The 12:3s of Prostate Health into The ABCs of Prostate Health ) . Cornell made collages and dioramas , exquisite boxes he 'd present to starlets and ballerinas . Foer tries similar stuff , transforming antique boxes into surrealed-out gifts called ( admittedly meaninglessly ) " portable novels . " FOER HAS READ HIS PHILIP ROTH , BUT THE INVENTOR OF THE fame-addled novelist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the creeping fact of his celebrity . " Maybe if I were the kind of person who lived in the Village and went to lots of parties , my life might change a little bit . But I come out here and make collages and do stupid stuff very much on my own . I do n't think my life 's going to change . " Even as one critic uses the occasion of her review to propose marriage and another charges him with callow treatment of the Holocaust , he remains unflummoxed , and his agent , Nicole Aragi , tells him the same thing she tells all her first-time authors : " Do n't believe any of it . " His editor , Eric Chinski , says , " Jonathan is particularly interested in deflating the idea of the writer as heroic figure . " On his book tour-8 cities this spring , another 30 in the fall-he 'll hand out self-addressed envelopes to his audiences , soliciting selfportraits on 4 " x 6 " cards . " I feel very insistent upon this . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and I read to you and , hey , are n't we all enlightened , that was really fun . ' It 's like , " I give you something , you give me something ; I 'm vulnerable , you 're vulnerable . " ' He 'll also do readings and workshops at high schools . He 's done so once already and calls it the best day of his life . HE PHONE RINGS . THE ACTOR LIEV SCHREIBER HAS BOUGHT the film rights to the book and is calling to work over an idea for the screenplay 's structure . Last year , he got a look at the New Yorker excerpt and arranged to meet the author . " I went expecting to meet ... someone a lot older , " Schreiber says . " Or at least bigger . " " He likes to make fun of my size , " says Foer , who stands maybe 5 foot 10 . " We 've had to pose for one or two pictures just for , like , my momand he 'll , like , kneel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie will actually be made . Nor is Schreiber : " Right now , we 're just enjoying the fantasy of making the film . " ) When the phone rings again , it 's Chinski , calling just to talk . " We 're like a bunch off  --  ing schoolgirls , " Foer says . He twirls a finger through his hair in self  --  mockery . " What did you do today ? He said what ? " Foers having Chinski and the rest of his publishing team over for dinner later in the week . Instead of a book party- " I do n't want to be the center of attention in that way " - he 's hosting a potluck . Which , however , poses complications of its own : " I 'm a bit of a Top Ramen kind of guy . " DOES HE THINK HE 'LL BE A WRITER 20 YEARS FROM NOW ? " If I 'm not dead , which I probably will be , I 'll be pursuing the things that I pursued in that novel , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to know . " Is he serious about imminent death ? " This is a bit of self-diagnosis : So , my heart 's been , like , fluttering .... You know how people use the heart in figurative language ? My heart is racing . ' My heart skipped a beat . ' My heart is no longer the subject of figurative language . It 's all literal .... I 've noticed my heart racing 300 beats a minute regularly , or if I see something that moves me , I can feel a great , great pain in my heart , and I do n't know if this is because I 've been eating too much meat recently , or what .. but it 's really disconcerting and it 's really exhilarating . " When did this condition set in ? " A couple weeks ago , after I turned in my draft . " That would be the first draft of his second novel , which he just handed off to Aragi . " Ever since then , I 've been convinced I 'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . Then we 'll sell a lot of copies . You wan na talk about literary celebrity ? When I 'm dead I 'll be getting laid every night . " <p>
