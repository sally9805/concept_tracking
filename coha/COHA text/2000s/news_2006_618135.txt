<p> A recent column asked readers , " How does illegal immigration affect you ? " ( AJC Gwinnett Opinions , Aug. 11 ) . Here is one reader 's response : <p> This is how illegal imigration has affected me and my family . <p> I believe strongly that I am not the only one experiencing these situations . People of our country need to know what is happening to our livelihood , schools and neighborhoods . <p> The value of my home , based on current sales , has fallen almost 20 percent . As I drive through my subdivision , I make a mental note of the new graffiti on traffic signs and fences , the old , unregistered and abandoned cars , beer bottles and cans from the night before 's drinking fest , six to eight vehicles parked at 60 percent of the homes , trash strewn about front lawns , swing sets and play houses in front yards , homes that have weathered and peeling paint , business vehicles ( irrigation companies , pest control companies , welding companies ) parked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors half open with sheets , blankets and shower curtains hanging to divide the garage into bedrooms for the " other family members , " eight children playing in one yard and living in the house with three adult females and four adult males . <p> Then there is the constant carrying of building supplies  --  drywall and framing lumber  --  being brought into the house to divide the family room or living room into more bedrooms or divide a master bedroom to provide at least one more sleeping area . I have been inside of these houses and seen this for myself . <p> My daughter plays with the children every once in a while . When I come to the house to get her , I ask myself , " Wow , this house is the same as mine , but I have three bedrooms and they have six . How did they fit six bedrooms in 1,500 square feet of living space ? " <p> On a designated Saturday every two to three months , our block captains pass out fliers to all 140 homes notifying the residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block party " and to bring your own brooms , rakes , gloves and trash bags to do a clean sweep of the entire subdivision . Turnout is usually just the block captains , while the other residents sit on the front stairs or peek out windows covered with blankets to see why we are walking on their lawn , as we sweep through the neighborhood picking up the trash they leave in their own front yards . <p> As we move through , picking up trash and sweeping or raking the gutters , my daughter , 10 , and I wonder if it is really worth it , because it is Saturday , and it is inevitable that there will be a group of men that evening who speak no English , standing in a driveway drinking beer and throwing empty cans and bottles in the road . Those bottles break , forcing me to do daily tire inspections on my vehicles , and the cans are left there until the next " block party . " <p> The men laugh as cars drive by and they hear the crunching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , phwet " sound as the cars move on , leaking air out of tires . They have put a cardboard box from a case of beer in the middle of the road . As I approach in my car , they are watching me . I stop just as I get to the box and they begin to laugh as I get out of my car and move the box , which is full of empties . About 20 minutes later , I return from the store and the box is there , in the middle of the road again . The men are standing around , drinking beer , and begin laughing as I pull up and get out to move it . <p> Every day , as I drive through my neighborhood , I encounter a small group of children and teenagers , mostly Hispanic , walking in the middle of the street . They turn to look at me and keep walking , not even bothering to move to the side of the road , so I am unable to drive around them . It has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I reach my cul-de-sac . I realize pedestrians have the right of way , but this is carrying the law too far . What have the parents been teaching these children , I ask myself ? <p> Some of the lawns have not been mowed for three months . Weeds and grass are more than waist high . No lawn work has been done since they moved in . Not even leaves from the past fall have been raked . Weeds have been allowed to thrive curbside on a curve , blocking the view of drivers until they have to swerve into an oncoming vehicle to avoid missing a woman and toddler and infant in a carriage . Dogs are not kept in fenced yards or on leashes . Everything from pit bulls to mutts roam free , and at times they chase children and adults . <p> I have witnessed no less than four accidents in the past month , all involving Hispanic males or females . A few months ago , I was parked in a parking lot and a Hispanic woman backed out of her spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vehicle and causing $4,000 worth of damage . When I said I was calling the police , the male passenger said he could fix my vehicle for $1,000 . Wait a minute ! Why should I pay him to fix something that was the fault of someone else ? I called the police . <p> The Gwinnett County officer arrived and checked licenses , registrations and insurance cards  --  but only mine because the driver of the other vehicle could not speak English , nor did she have a license , registration or insurance card . Because this was on private property , a strip mall parking lot , the officer could not write a ticket . <p> I still wonder why the officer allowed the driver to drive away , and he was right behind the vehicle at fault , following her for a block on a county/state road then turning off . Yes , the officer turned off without stopping the driver and arresting her for not having the documents required to be legally driving on a public road in any state ! <p> On several occasions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamps by non-English-speaking Hispanics who are passing these welfare stamps from one adult to another , five total , to get enough to make one adult 's purchase . I walk out to the parking lot as three of the five drive off in a new Navigator , a one-year old Escalade , and a new Suburban . None of the vehicles had Georgia license plates , in fact none had valid plates . The Navigator had a cardboard tag that said . " TAGG APPLYED FR , JUENE 16 , " the Escalade had a piece of cardboard that said , " LOSTED TAGG NU APPLYED FOR . " <p> This may all sound like I am prejudiced or a bigot . I assure you I am not . I was raised better than that , and my life would sound like a world tour to some and a lifetime of adventure to others , as I made friends all over the world , friends of many different races and religions . I am for immigration , but only legal immigration by people who are ready to accept our laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . <p> I know a large number of these people are not here legally . They buy houses using tax IDs , then either ignore our laws or think they do not apply to them . They ca n't speak , read or write English . They have lowered the integrity of our schools , brought in gangs and trashed our neighborhoods . <p> They should be on notice , however . I will report them . <p> Here is a suggestion for the Gwinnett County Board of Education . Start a one-year mandatory course in English . If a child can not read or write , in English , at their grade level , then the only class they attend for their first year in our school system is " Learning the English Language " for six hours a day during that first year . Once they show proficiency in the English language , they may then attend classes with other English-speaking children . I firmly believe this direction would be better then placing them in classes and making them take mandatory tests that result in poorer school ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those are the ones who obey the laws , work , pay taxes and do n't buy a house in my neighborhood for three or more generations of their family and learn how to speak , read , and write the language of our country , English . <p> Maybe this is all because our government does n't care and wo n't enforce the laws , I do n't know ! <p> But my wife and I hold two of the votes that may or may not be for our lawmakers . Show us that you deserve the votes . Take action against the illegal immigration that is turning our nation backward in time . <p> Robert Kerns lives in Lilburn . Photo : ROBERT J. KERNS
