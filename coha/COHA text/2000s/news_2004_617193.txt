<p> The trajectory of aerospace engineer Parker H. " Pete " Petit 's life changed on a lazy summer afternoon in 1970 when he heard his wife scream . <p> She had just discovered their 6-month-old son , Brett , had stopped breathing during a nap , a victim of SIDS , or sudden infant death syndrome . Petit was able to restart the infant 's heart , but his brain had been starved of oxygen too long and the child died two days later . <p> The Petits buried their son , then drove to the North Carolina mountains for a few days of solitude . It was there that Petit restlessly began sketching out what would become his new life 's work . <p> " Anger is n't a very productive emotion , " says Petit , now 64 , chairman and chief executive at Matria Healthcare . " I wanted to channel my grief into action . I got an idea for an infant heart and respiration monitor that parents could use at home . <p> " That became a series of short-term goals : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had some talent as a project manager , and those steps were things that I understood and knew how to deal with . " <p> The ability to create a successful new business from devastating personal tragedy is exceedingly rare , according to academics who study entrepreneurship . But for those who can convert pain into inspiration , life 's misfortunes can point the way to technical breakthroughs and enduring achievements . <p> James Martin invented aircraft ejection seats and founded the world 's leading manufacturer of the life-saving escape mechanisms after his friend and business partner , Valentine Baker , was killed in the crash of an experimental plane in 1942 . <p> " The personal loss to James Martin was immeasurable , " according to a published history of Martin-Baker Ltd . " It was this painful tragedy that really fired the passionate interest in the safety of air crews , which was later to become the pivot of his life . " <p> Martin-Baker ejection seats are used in a wide variety of U.S. military jets , and the seats are credited with saving 7,032 fliers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a professor and author who studies entrepreneurship , says successful inventors and business leaders must have high " adversity quotients " to overcome the problems they face daily . But those who can turn heartbreak into personal motivation set themselves apart . <p> " There 's a resilient elite who can harness adversity and turn scarring events into fuel to achieve their purposes in life , " he says . " It 's not that they simply think happy thoughts . They do n't . It 's just that their brains are incapable of comprehending the meaning of the word ' impossible . ' " <p> Different point of view <p> Ross Kreines was a 17-year-old basketball player when , as a passenger in a car crash , he broke his neck and was paralyzed . Now he has opened a physical rehabilitation center in New York and plans to expand them throughout Florida . <p> " I saw the health care system from the user 's point of view and thought I could do better , " said Kreines , now 30 , who walks with the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , people in rehab can come to one spot and get the cutting-edge treatment they need . " <p> Kreines began meeting with physical therapists and health care experts two years ago preparing to launch his new venture . <p> " People who have been injured need to approach rehabilitation just like an athlete , " he says . " It 's not glamorous . It 's a down-and-dirty process  --  but I know it works . " <p> Don Brawley 's Eternal Reefs is an Atlanta company that creates artificial reefs from cremated ashes . He founded the company after his father-in-law , Carleton Palmer , asked to be buried at sea . <p> " He was a fisherman , he liked to dive , and he was terminally ill when he asked me to put his remains in a reef where there would be lots of grouper and snapper , " Brawley said . <p> " We came up with this idea for a lasting tribute to him that would be environmentally sensitive . But it did n't occur to me that it would be the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it and started asking if they could make similar arrangements . " <p> Brawley 's company , which employs four full-time workers , charges $1,000 to $5,000 to mix cremated ashes into dome-shaped concrete structures that form the foundation for artificial reefs . So far , the company has placed 250 sets of remains in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico . <p> ' I had a vision ' <p> Commercial success is n't guaranteed , no matter how noble the goal or pure the motives . <p> When aerospace engineer Petit quit his job as a Lockheed manager to build infant monitors , he went deeply into debt . Banks would n't lend him money , and Petit took out a personal loan on the family 's house . <p> Within six months of his son 's death , however , Petit had built a prototype infant monitor in the Georgia Tech electronics lab where he studied as an undergrad . Then , with his family pediatrician , he tested the device at Northside Hospital and became convinced the monitor worked and there was a market for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petit says . " But I had a vision for something I knew I could achieve , and once I had confidence in that , I was willing to take the risk . " <p> Petit went to night school at Georgia State University and earned an MBA in 1973 . His company , Healthdyne , went public in 1981 , then split into three public companies in 1995 : Healthdyne Technologies , Healthdyne Information Enterprises and Matria Healthcare . <p> Updated models of the infant monitors Petit invented are still in use at hospitals and clinics and in the homes of parents with infants at risk from SIDS . As the companies he founded grew and diversified , Petit has taken on many other initiatives . Matria , for example , focuses on managing the treatment of chronic diseases and lowering costs for individuals , health plans and employers . <p> But even today , the father of three adult children and grandfather says he 's often reminded of his original work on infant monitors . <p> " Years ago , I started getting letters , poems and songs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , " he said . " Some were revived after the monitor 's alarm went off . There are a lot of families out there who did n't have to go through the tragedy that we went through  --  and that 's satisfying . " <p> Petit takes a day off work every June 30 , the anniversary of his son 's death , and tries to reflect on the things his company has done and its future goals . <p> He was trying to avoid needless deaths when he designed and built his first infant monitor . But the companies he founded have created thousands of jobs , marriages among employees and wealth for him , too . In 1996 , he donated $5 million to Georgia Tech to found a bio-engineering institute . <p> " I look at this company , all the things that have gone on , all the blessings , " Petit says . " It 's hard to believe it all came about because of one little guy . " These entrepreneurs were spurred by personal tragedies and have created successful businesses .
