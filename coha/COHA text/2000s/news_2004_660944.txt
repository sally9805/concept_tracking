<p> Still flushed with their success in capturing Saddam Hussein , a joint CIA-military commando unit called Task Force 121 has been dispatched to Afghanistan with a new mission to get Osama bin Laden . <p> The elite unit is part of a growing host of intelligence resources joining the hunt along Afghanistan 's border with Pakistan . The momemtum prompted US military officials here in January to predict confidently that America 's most wanted man would be taken this year . <p> But interviews with top Afghan and US intelligence officials reveal a number of reasons the US has failed so far to catch Mr. bin Laden and his coterie of fighters . The difficulties , which can not be easily overcome , are numerous : <p> * Few of America 's local spies trust the US military or US intelligence agents , who by one account rotate in and out within three months . <p> * Most of America 's human intelligence comes from local interpreters , many of whom have their own personal scores to settle , and have a history of giving false information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone intercepts are almost useless in a country with few phones to monitor . <p> " Without human intelligence , this operation will be meaningless , " says a senior Afghan intelligence officer , who requests anonymity . " Instead of catching Osama , the Americans will only create more opposition for themselves . " <p> Most Afghans want the Americans to stay and rebuild the country , this Afghan intelligence officer adds , noting that Afghans regularly provide American intelligence agents and soldiers with tip-offs of Taliban movements . But individual American agents do n't spend enough time in Afghanistan to know who is telling them the truth . <p> " American intelligence agencies change their staff every three months , " he says . " How is it possible for a foreigner to come to Kandahar or Khost , to understand the society or the psychology , to know a man 's tribal relations , his past behavior , his personal motives , whether he is honest or if he is telling a lie ? It is not possible in three months . " <p> Poor intelligence has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the warlord , Badshah Khan Zadran , sent American AC-130 gunships and Navy fighters to attack a convoy of vehicles full of Afghan tribal elders on their way to show allegiance to the post-Taliban government ; 65 civilians were reportedly killed . <p> In July 2002 , at least 48 people were killed and 117 wounded when US warplanes attacked a wedding party in the town of Deh Rawud in central Afghanistan . The US military said a gunship had come under fire in the area . <p> More recently , on Dec. 6 , 2003 , US forces admitted mistakenly killing nine children when they bombed the home of a suspected Taliban commander near the town of Ghazni . The attack , prompted by " extensive intelligence " was precise , but the target left the location an hour before . <p> " I believe as long as you use local , infamous warlords , you 'll always have problems , " says Ali Ahmed Jalali , the Afghan interior minister , who maintains an extensive intelligence service . " Some of these warlords wanted to ensure mistakes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases where misinformation has been fed into the system . " <p> Friends in low places <p> What the US and Afghan intelligence agencies need to start doing , an Afghan intelligence official says , is look for friends in lower places . <p> " There are rumors now that bin Laden is in Pakistan , in Wana , in Pakistani Kashmir , or in Nooristan near the Chinese border , " says the Afghan intelligence officer . " What the intelligence people should do is go to these places and find farmers , or shepherds , or nomads , and build good relations with them , " he says , rubbing fingers together in the symbol for money . " This is how you get information . " <p> Information received from local sources , however , does n't come in English . And the US 's own interpreters - the crucial first filter for tipoffs - are often untrustworthy . <p> " Most of the interpreters and translators have links with Hizb-e Islami and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , " says Mr. Jalali , referring to a former US ally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . <p> " Of all the intelligence that is given to the Americans by their colleagues , perhaps only 20 percent of it is correct , " says Samiullah Qatra , commander of the Afghan border police . " And you might have realized that most of the problems in Afghanistan emanate from tribal rivalries and monetary gain . " <p> US officials with ties to the intelligence community admit that the war in Afghanistan is a difficult game for the high-tech Western spy agencies . <p> " We 're kind of losing there , " says a senior US official in Washington , with knowledge of intelligence operations . " I just think it 's very , very difficult to do anything with 10,000 troops in some of the world 's highest mountains in a place the size of Texas . " <p> But American politicians and the media need to get realistic about what the CIA and other American operatives can do in Afghanistan , this senior official adds . " People who talk about blaming the intelligence services for not getting assets in that area do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending a white-skinned guy to penetrate an Indian reservation . " <p> Yet penetrating that tribal society , and finding out which tribe is harboring Taliban leaders - and Osama bin Laden - is the name of the game . For this , the US official says , US intelligence agents and special forces are hoping for a break . <p> " What do they think - that bin Laden will be sitting in a rocking chair inside a cave waiting for us to pull up ? " says the official . " It will be pure serendipity if we get him . He 'll zig ; we 'll zag and there we 'll both be and we 'll see who wins . " <p> Such chance encounters have reportedly happened before . A French general said Monday that French troops working with US forces in Afghanistan have come close to capturing bin Laden . " On several occasions , I even think that he slipped out of a net that was well closed , " Gen. Henri Bentegeat told France 's Europe-1 radio . <p> But getting advance notice about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggests Mr. Qatra . " When I was a guerrilla against the Soviets , I would never visit home for more than two hours . If my family asked me which road I was taking , I would tell them the wrong direction . I did that to protect myself , because maybe the intelligence people would put pressure on my family . " <p> " It 's not only me that used these tactics , Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden also fought during that time , " Mr. Qatra adds . And it would be difficult to send a spy to infiltrate the inner ranks of either bin Laden or Mullah Omar . " They are surrounding themselves only with people who are 100 percent reliable . The people they do n't trust will be kept far away . " <p> Signs of progress <p> On a visit to Kabul Wednesday , US Secretary of State Colin Powell reiterated the US commitment to the fight and to rebuilding Afghanistan . " The United States is in this for the long haul . Afghans do n't have to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> On the other side of the border , Pakistan has made gains against Al Qaeda and Taliban forces hiding in the tribal belt . An intense firefight Tuesday left at least 15 Pakistani paramilitary forces and 24 suspected Al Qaeda fugitives dead . <p> The US has made some strides in finding the enemy , according to Gen. Hilaluddin Hilal , Afghanistan 's deputy minister of interior . The US is " getting better and better , and they have had big successes , " including raids in Deh Chopan in Zabul Province , Maruf and Spin Boldak in Kandahar Province , Bahgran valley in Helmand Province , and a few operations in Paktia and Khost provinces . In these operations , US intelligence agents and Army Special Forces were able to detect Taliban commanders and take them out . <p> " In the beginning , they just wanted to act very fast , they did n't want to analyze the information first , " says General Hilal . " Now they are thinking more profoundly , checking their information with many more sources . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden , there 's no guarantee the wider war on terror will be won . One former US intelligence officer with experience in Central Asia says the problem with the current war on terrorism is its concept of the enemy , Al Qaeda . <p> " We 've somehow made this sound like a big company , run with a CEO and branch offices everywhere . Mostly these are national religious movements . And they do coordinate , they 're like-minded , they agree on world views . But do they take orders ? " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
