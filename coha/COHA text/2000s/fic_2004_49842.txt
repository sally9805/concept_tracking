THE SCRIVENER SMOOTHS THE DAMP CLAY . With his stylus he presses down the call to the face-off : " Valley of Elah , Exit 27 off the Beersheba-Shiloh Freeway . The day after the first full moon in Kislev . Mark ye this number : 24 . Later . P.S. Ye are toast . " <p> Men whose breath smells of wine and herbs clap Goliath on the back and roar , " Twenty-four , man . Fucking twenty-four ! " <p> " We 're counting on you , boy ! " <p> " Twenty-four ! " they whoop . <p> Not a wineshop in Gath but they 're saying , " What 's your pleasure ? Wine or barley-brew ? " Once , disgrace was Goliath 's meat and shame his wine . Now Goliath does n't go out without his brothers , who like him are possessors of supernumerary digits , so that the number of their fingers and toes totals twenty-four , but unlike him having an ordinary height of three and a half cubits : his posse to protect him from the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking twenty-four ! " <p> " Those goddamn sons of Abraham wo n't know what hit them . " <p> Goliath ca n't stop a goofy grin from spreading over his face . <p> " Next one 's on me ! " shouts another voice from the dark cave of a bar . <p> His brother Lahmi says , " Neither wine nor brew shall pass his lips till the battle hath been joined and won . " Truth : the wine and brew make the headaches worse , but if Goliath says , " I am sore and aching . A thumping is in my head and the very jointures of my body swell and offend me " - well , then it 's just : " Brother , what you need is a good fornication ! " " I know a wanton you could lie with carnally ! " " Corruption , lad , corruption-we all have need of it ! " <p> Lahmi hoists himself up onto a table and puts both his hands on his brother 's shoulders . " Let not his might run out of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make his strength safe and fast , until after our enemies have been smited . When their blood waters the grasses of the Valley of Elah , then shall my brother 's seed flow out from him . " <p> Once Goliath was a boy like any other boy : scampering with his brothers and cousins out of the city gates when they were opened to let a caravan in , feasting on the wild grapes and honey they gathered in the wilderness ; throwing rocks at the soldiers guarding the checkpoints . One day , they had even ventured to the chain link fence topped with coiled razor wire and hung with metal signs inscribed with runes none could any longer decode . In the unpruned trees beyond the fence they saw the fluttering remnants of torn plastic carrier bags hanging like moss in the trees . <p> A wailing hermit , barefooted and white-bearded , patrolling the perimeter of the fence came towards them . The hermit 's fingernails were long and yellowed , mottled like the horn of some beast : " The tale has been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell it to thee , how this place came to be a wasteland giving birth to naught but death : a beast of the air-some scorned god mayhaps , or demon-rained upon the cities of the plain fire and brimstone . The people within those cities became in a flash naught but shadows . " The hermit wept as he spake these words and , weeping still , continued on his way . he turned and called back to them : " Stay away , my lads , stay well away . Megadeath ! Megamegadeath ! " <p> Goliath grew . At first his growth was measured in mere digits and palms : with pride he felt himself to be gaining in stature , leaving his boyhood behind . But he grew and grew . First he towered over his elder brothers by a single cubit , then by two . From an ordinary boy , whom the elders could not always tell apart from his brothers and cousins , he became singular : the one , the only Goliath . he was taunted in the streets : " Fee-fie-fo-fum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> War looms , and everything changes : The endless 24/7 , day-in/day-out , same-old/same-old ; the whole Monday-nothing , Tuesday-nothing , **30;2022;TOOLONG , **44;2054;TOOLONG , **27;2100;TOOLONG thing flies away . No longer do the men of Gath tremble before death : they rush to meet it , eager to be tested , like metal in the fire . It seems the events of their lives , which heretofore have been a mere collection of haphazard incidents , now form themselves into a coherent narrative . The Philistines look back over their own lives , and their life as a people : the course of it has been leading inexorably to zero hour in the Valley of Elah . <p> Pain wakes Goliath . he works his mouth open and shut , twisting it around , unkinking it . he cups his hands around his jaw and rubs . The surfeit of growth hormone that causes giantism results in overgrowth of the bone and temporomandibular joint pain . <p> It 's not just his jaw that aches : the very sinews and joinings of his body do . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee bone 's connected to the thigh bone , the thigh bone 's connected to the hip bone , etc. , and he is aware of every one of those bonds . <p> Sometimes , when he wakes in the night the Negev Desert there is a tribe of beings so colossal that the women of that race could scoop him up in their arms , cradle him like a baby , rub away his pains with ointments of camphor and myrrh and some magical substance of which only they have knowledge . <p> His brothers , sprawled around him on the portico , breathe heavily . That sound mingles with the snuffles and sighs from the sheep and goats in the pens of the adjacent yard . Goliath clambers to his feet and , crouching almost double , passes through the doorway into the house , threading his way across the sleeping forms of other brothers and cousins who during the night migrated into the house from the garden . Peoples of the desert are scavengers , and scavengers are wanderers , following water and the promise of water ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking forage and scrub ; moving from the harvest in the olive groves to tend the terraced hillsides where barley is grown . Inside the houses of their villages they are not still , not even at night : they may fall asleep in the gardens at the core of their houses and then , in the middle of the night , make their way to the roofs , or stretch out upon carpets laid on the inner floors of packed earth . <p> he hears , from the women 's quarters above , the sound of his sister Asthah 's slow and steady rocking , matched by her slow and steady mumbling : " Caleb , judah , Arba , Hebron , Anak , Sheshai , Ahiman , Talmai , Debir , Kirjath-sepher , Othniel , Kenaz . Caleb . " She says again , " Caleb , Caleb , " and whispers out a hollow laugh . <p> At first , when she came back from captivity , every member of the household-old and young , master and servant , male and female-was kept awake by her ceaseless chanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods , the naming of the lines laid across this land . Now her babble has become part of the fabric of their lives . <p> He steps outside , into the moonless night . he hears the chirp of crickets . The stars press close and closer ; it seems they might leave their firmament behind and descend to this earthly realm . he hears the sound of cartwheels rumbling against cobblestones : no doubt some scavenger , seeking discarded wine jugs . The night world of Gath belongs to those who glean in the dumpsters , the eaters of parched corn , the harlots and the vagabonds . <p> " Hey , big boy . " <p> He answers not . <p> The wanton draws closer to him ; the musky scent of attar of roses fills his nostrils . <p> " Do n't be shy . " Her lips so close the words are lambent upon his ear . She strokes a single finger down the ridge of his collarbone . <p> He shakes himself free of her touch . " Gold have I not , silver neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek . Only the pleasure of lying with you . " <p> " You think I have forgot who you are . I know you , and I know your name . Japar . Not long ago you mocked me . " <p> ' " T is ancient history . " <p> " I am at once far more a man than any other man , and far less . You said my thing was like the budded rose of a child . " <p> " That was then , and this is now . " <p> He shows to her his broad back . <p> " You think we harlots are weak-willed ? " she says , massaging his shoulders as she speaks . Her touch soothes his aching joints . " It is no easy thing to be a woman such as I , in this new world of the patriarchs . I shall not easily surrender my desire for you . " <p> " Now you desire me ... " <p> " We all live within these city walls , " she says , her hands kneading deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , do you not ? True enough , once I mocked you , as all once did . But now thou art no longer scorned and pilloried ; now thou art raised up and praised above all men . " <p> " Your hands soothe the aching within me . " <p> " The night is deep , and velvet dark . No one will see us . We can join together in whatever fashion pleaseth us both . " <p> Seeing that he hesitates still , she adds , " Our pleasures shall be manifold . We may sate ourselves not in some grunting act of copulation but in a manner more cunning and more subtle . And in addition to the fleshly pleasures that our joining brings , on the morrow I shall have the pleasure of bragging that I have lain with Goliath , that I have borne our hero 's great weight . And you-you may glory in taking the one who once derided you . " <p> She takes his hand and leads him towards the room where she abides , beyond the souk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pads after her , like an overgrown puppy , watching her haunches ripple beneath the fine linen of her gown , drawing in the musky smell wafting after her . <p> Shortly after Asthah and the others left alive returned , a delegation of women from the tribe of Ruth came down from the hills . The elders barred the city gates against them . The women veiled themselves in white and chanted , clapping in rhythmic time , turning now to the right , now to the left : <p> Isis , Astarte , Diana , Hecate , Demeter , <p> Kali , Demeter , Hecate , Diana , Astarte , Isis . . . <p> Our goddess gave birth to your god . <p> The young men mounted the ramparts of the city walls and hiked up their robes , showing their bare backsides . <p> The women shout , one after another : " Do you think such a sight strikes fear in our hearts ? " " Were you not born of woman ? " " Have not we women given birth to you men ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ? " " Nay a million multiplied by a million times ? " <p> " Get thee hence ! " the men call down . <p> One of the men lifts a bullhorn to his lips and calls out , " What was the first plague visited upon our people ? " <p> " Laser-guided missiles ! " the other men chorus back . <p> " And the second plague ? " <p> " Apache helicopters ! " <p> " And the next plague ? " <p> " Kalashnikovs ! " <p> " And the next ? " <p> " Sidewinders ! " <p> " And ? " <p> " Arrowheadsl " <p> " Hydra rockets ! " <p> " Scuds ! " <p> " And the next plague ? " <p> " F-16s ! " <p> " And the last plague , the worst plague of all ? " <p> " The last plague , the worst plague of all : the plague of feminists ! " <p> It was said that at night a few of the women who had returned from captivity made their way-whether of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's people beyond the walls of the city . <p> The next night Goliath awakens again . He lies still upon the carpet spread upon the earth , staring up at the moon , a newborn 's fingernail . He hears Asthah 's whispered chanting : " . .. from the shore of the salt sea , from the bay that looketh southward , to Maaleh-acrabbim , along to Zin ... " <p> He looks to his left : she is hunkered on the ground next to him , her eyes fixed intently on him . <p> She smiles when she sees him , although she does not cease to speak : " And the fenced cities are Ziddim , Zer , and Hammath , Rakkath , and Chinnereth and . .. " <p> " Hush , " he whispers , " hush . " <p> He stretches out his hand to her , and she takes it . When she first came back , she could not abide the touch of any man , not even him . <p> " Sister , why do you watch over me so ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Horites ... I did not join the women of Ruth . . . Duke Lotan , duke Shobal , duke Zibeon . . . they spoke of healing and I ... duke Anah/Duke Dishon , duke Ezer , duke Dishan ... I would that I could drink their blood . . . And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom : and the name of his city was Dinhabah ... a cup of it would I drain to its very dregs . . . And Bela died , and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead ... " <p> " If it is what thou truly desires , I will hang an Israelite by his toes and let his blood drain from him , and bring it back to thee . " <p> " And Jobab died , and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead ... I would there could be justice . . . And Husham died , and Hadad the son of Bedad , who smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vengeance is a poor second ... And Hadad died , and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead ... Yet the poor second must I take ... And Samlah died , and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead . .. My hatred sickens me . .. And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died ... to lust for blood . . . and Hadar reigned in his stead . . . yet I can no more will myself free of it ... and the name of his city was Pau .. . than will the stars from the sky . . . " <p> " Sister , would it soothe you to walk outside , beneath the stars ? " <p> Her only answer is the slipping of her thin hand into his paw . <p> The night is silent save for her whispering , " Pharez begat Hezron/And Hezron begat Ram ... " Each time she says " begat " her voice lilts upwards as if she were puzzled . <p> In the midst of her chant a single word rises like a bubble in water : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amminadab/And Amminadab begat ? Nahshon/and-stars- " <p> " The stars ? " Goliath asks . " The stars are beautiful ? " <p> " Yes , yes , " she mutters , then hurries on , " and Ram begat ? Amminadab/And Amminadab begat ? Nahshon/and Nahshon . .. " <p> Her shift has slipped down off her shoulder and he glimpses her breast , which could be the breast of any other girl on the verge of womanhood . Her experiences have not marked her ; her body has swallowed up within itself all evidence . <p> Goliath imagines his foot crushing a grizzled face that might have belonged to one of her captors ; he imagines entering the soldiers they will defeat , not with his own member , but with a stick or a spear . <p> " Hush , " he says . <p> Asthah is silent , but rocks back and forth in agitation . Shortly , a plea bursts out of her mouth : " Oh , Brother , let me say my words again . When they do not issue forth , they dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " If silence pains you , you must speak . " <p> She furrows her brow , taps the air with her left index finger . " Nahshon , Nahshon , yes , Nahshon . Nahshon begat Salmon/And Salmon begat Boaz , and Boaz begat Obed . Issue have I none . I beget naught but these begats . " She spits these last two sentences into the void that would usually be a pause for the drawing in of breath . " Obed begat Jesse , and Jesse begat David . " <p> She leans her head against him , not ceasing her muttering . A night breeze blows the scent of olives from the groves on the hillside above the city . <p> At last he speaks the words he has been intending for the past hour to utter : " Last night-I knew a woman for the first time . " <p> He feels her body grow tense , her chanting becoming more frantic . " Caleb , judah , Arba-Kind ? - Hebron , Anak , Sheshai , Ahiman , TalmaiThought you of me ? - Debir-  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thoughts of you . " <p> " Pain ? " <p> " Knowledge had I of her , and there is no knowledge without pain , " Goliath says , but he sees he has not answered her question in saying this . <p> When Asthah 's physical wounds had healed , they took her to the witch doctor . Asthah wailed when a dove was sacrificed so its entrails could be read . The healer steepled his fingers and said to the family : " Post-traumatic stress disorder hath triggered an underlying psychosis .... Go ye to the herbalist and she will give unto thine child an infusion which may alleviate some symptoms . " he raised his gaze , and met that of Asthah 's father : " Hereafter will she be mad , even unto the hour of her death . " <p> They led her home and shut her up safely in the women 's quarters . <p> Goliath 's pain is not the only secret kept locked within the walls of this house . Better she should have been returned to them a corpse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder of their humiliation . <p> The king speaks , and his tribunes and spin doctors and minions sit in the square , underneath the date palms alongside the gurgling spring , and relay what he has said : " Evil must be purged from our world . If the tribes of this land join not with us , we will make our way alone-for are we not the Philistines , great lovers of freedom and defenders of liberty ? Yet the Canaanites are now yoked with us , and the Hittites , and Amorites , and Perizzites , and Hivites-even the Jebusites are getting with the program . " <p> In the distance , dust is being raised by the grunts drilling on the plateaus in the hills above Gath . The sound of their chants fades in and out of earshot of those gathered in the square : " Left right left . . . left right left . .. keep ye in step ... " <p> " All the tribes of the world , " the minions continue , " cry out against the crimes of the Israelites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jericho to tumble down , and then did he not utterly destroy all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , and then , not content with mass murder , add ignominy to horror , torching the corpses of man and beast alike ? Did he not then , unashamed , proclaim these deeds to all the world , and say that his god had commanded him to do this ? And did not their Samson carry out his suicide mission , bringing down the pillars and the roof above , a mass murderer of innocents ? " <p> " Left right left . . . left right left . . . " is carried by the winds coming down out of the hills . <p> A chariot with a bumper sticker that says NUKE SAMMY whips past . <p> Spray-painted in red paint on an adobe wall are the words GOLIATH IS NOT THE ANSWER . A spray-painted X is splayed across it with the words next to it : IF YOU ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STADIUM . <p> The town crier , making his circuit , calls out : " The shadow of the sundial stands at its most paltry : noon is nigh . The king is in his palace ; Dagon in his temple ; all is well . <p> " Weather here in Gath : the sun shineth above us , and sweet rain will fall tonight . Weather in the vale of Elah : current temperature-16 degrees centigrade , with precipitation . Yet take heart , fellow Philistines , for the casting of sticks this morning by the prognosticators reveals there shall be blue skies and bright sun on game day ! " <p> Towards dusk , the warriors troop down from training in the hills . Their faces are streaked with dirt and sweat , so their eyes glisten like black jewels . <p> A beardless youth rushes to Goliath 's house , " Quickly come ! The CO hath need of thee . " <p> His mother calls to Asthah , " A clean linen tunic ! Kohl for his eyes ! Aye , brothers too , give hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice , thrice : " Apace ! Apace ! " <p> " Yet nine days remain until the battle is to be joined , " Goliath says , lumbering to his feet . " The armies of Israel-have they attacked ? " <p> " No , no , fear not- " says the messenger . <p> " My son knows not the meaning of the word ' fear . ' " <p> Goliath stares into his mother 's eyes , which give him no signal of complicity , only her shining belief in him . <p> " All the foot soldiers , " gasps out the messenger , " are called together , arrayed in order , in their brigades and their maniples . The light armored vehicles draw nigh into the square , the pommelers are called for , also the spear carriers and the axemen and the javeliners and the thrusters of pikes . Thou must shew thyself to the armies of our king , that they shall have the sweet foretaste of victory . " <p> As Goliath approaches the center of the city , a brother on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spring , the scent of dates in the air , mixed with the smell of dust raised by a thousand tromping feet , and hears a drill instructor bellowing at one of the recruits : " Once thou was regarded as an insect , but now it is evident that thou art less than that : a maggot . Does thou admit thou art a maggot ? " <p> " Sire , yes , sire . " <p> " Say it , soldier . " . <p> " I am a maggot , sire . " <p> " Louder , damsel- " <p> Espying Goliath , the drill sergeant turns his attention to all the men of his company : " Ah , pray silence , for comes before us now a man who crawleth not on his belly like the spawn of some slug , but a man whose grasp doth graze the very heavens , the one , the only : Goliath ! " <p> Goliath breaks his stride , looks abashed at all the huzzahs and alarums , but his **27;2129;TOOLONG manner just makes the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the assembly , pulls himself up to his full height , adjusts the folds of his robe , and says , " Men , looking out upon you , I see arrayed before me the finest pommels and javelins and chariots and light armored vehicles in all the Fertile Crescent . " Here he pauses for the cheers , which duly come . " Yet it is not with these pommels and these javelins and chariots and light armored vehicles that the victory shall be ours . " <p> Goliath hears his name , spoken by a single voice within the crowd , then taken up in general : " Goliath ! Goliath ! Goliath ! " <p> The commander lets them get pumped up for a while , then raises both his arms next to his head and gestures for silence . <p> " Human factors . Human factors . That shall the battle decide . " <p> " And the greatest of the human factors , " calls out a voice from the crowd , " Goliath ! " <p> " Goliath ! Goliath ! Goliath ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overlord says . <p> The hurrahs ricochet inside Goliath 's head . He wonders what would happen if he were to clap his hands over his ears , hunker down into a squat , rock from side to side , shouting , " Cease ! Cease forthwith ! " But only wonders . <p> " When they see our Goliath , then shall they turn tail and run . For his presence shall strike more fear into their hearts than any of our missiles which seeketh heat or our daisy cutters ; yea , even more than the sight of our stealth bombers in the sky . But then , my men , it must be your duty to turn this rout into a cleansing : we must purge this evil from our worldforevermore . " <p> Still they chant his name . <p> The moon is no longer a Turkish crescent . The moon waxes ; Goliath 's fear waxes with it . He eats the bread of cowardice alone : it is dry and sticketh in his craw . He knows full well what the Israelites will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philistines did to Samson . They will devise some torment that makes having eyes gouged out , being bound in fetters of brass , and forced to turn a grindstone in an unending circuit , a human , eyeless mule-makes that look enviable . <p> That night , Goliath watches the waxing moon above the hills of Judea . The next night it has crossed some boundary , so now it can be said to be swollen like a hunchback or a pregnant woman . Just days now . <p> Asthah finds him in the garden , running his fingernail down a shaft of grass , splitting it in half . <p> She lays her hand on his shoulder ; he shakes off her hand , clambers to his feet , paces . ( Her frantic speech continues , all the while : " The king of Jericho ; the king of Ai ; the king of Jerusalem ; the king of Hebron ; the king of Jarmuth . . . " ) <p> " Pray silence , sister dear . " <p> She lowers her voice , but does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of Gezer ; the king of Debir . . .

Moab , Kadesh , Golan . . . and never will another . . . " <p> " I would it were the day of battle . I can not abide this waiting . " <p> " Gilid , Gilgal . . . in the hills . . . Lebanon , Manasseh . . . the first rain hath . . . Jabbok , Bashan . . . " <p> Goliath speaks for her : " The first rain has fallen ? " <p> " Yea . . .

" <p> " These are the names of Esau 's sons . . . flee . . . Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau . . . his into the hills . . . Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau . . . I with thee . . . And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman , Omar , Zepho , and Gatam , and Kenaz . . . " <p> " How would we then live ? Thou knows what a poor , poor specimen of a man am I. My strength is no match for my vastness : I can neither plow nor sow a field , nor can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might exhibit myself to those who would , in terror of me , push towards me a plate of victuals or a jug of wine and plead that I , in recompense of these offerings , depart and harry them no more ? We are trapped within these walls of Gath , and trapped would we be without them . " <p> " These are the dukes that came of the Horites , duke Lotan , duke Shobal , duke Zibeon . . . locusts and wild honey . . . duke Anah/Duke Dishon , duke Ezer , duke Dishan . . . our bread could be . . . And these the kings : Bela son of Beor reigned in Edom . . . water our wine . . . " <p> He can not say to her : my hatred for the enemy seizes me more fiercely than lust for a woman ever has . I long to see their skulls cracked open , the soft jelly of their brains oozing onto the earth , as a jackal 's jaw spills the slime from a bird 's egg upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mothers , as even a mother hawk , returning to her nest to find it ravaged , her never-born fledgings fodder for some fox , keens as pitifully as any dove . <p> I could speak , Sister , and I could say many words , but those words would be like the words you chant . My language is like a flock of birds that rise up from some outcropping and fly away , disappearing into the infinite sky . And what they would leave behind is the stone upon which they roosted , dark and motionless , the black rock of my hatred . <p> Then , at last , the terrible waiting for the day of battle is coming to an end : the moon is one night shy of full . The soldiers gather in marching order , and set out , to the patriotic shouts ( and muffled sobs ) of the women and the men too young or old for battle . Goliath , in a tumbrel , surrounded by his brothers , is the last to go . <p> Soon they are arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encamped , opposite the mountaintop where the armies of the Israelites are encamped . He finds at the very forefront of the bivouac , a tent of gargantuan proportions for him to therein lodge-an omen unto the enemy . <p> He ambles towards the tent , but the morale officer and his crew stop him and say : " Not yet , brother . Not yet . " <p> One of the crew adds , " For fear , like desire , is always about the event which has not yet occurred . " <p> " College boy , " says the morale officer , and claps his subaltern fondly on the back . " Hold fast , Goliath , let you show yourself in the sliver of time between dusk and darkness . Let the sight of you beget fear in them , and then their night shall be a confinement in which that fear shall swell and grow like a babe in its mother 's womb . " <p> And so he waits , seated at a trestle table at the front of the improvised mess , devouring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , figs , olives , loaves of bread , pomegranate juice mixed with honey and water , goat , a vast pottage of barley . The mess hall grows quieter and quieter and then quiet . Goliath is licking goat grease from his fingers when he notices the absence of talk , hearing nothing but the chirping of crickets and the wind rustling the leaves of the olive trees in the groves below them . <p> And he sees that they are watching him attempting to fill the gorge within him . He surveys the mound of olive pits , the ribs of goat and sheep , the bowls scraped almost clean with the edge of his spoon . Yet he hungers still . <p> He turns his head away in shame . <p> But then he hears a single voice , crying out , " Goliath ! " <p> And then the chant becomes general : " Go-li-ath ! Go-li-ath ! " They clap their hands and stamp their feet upon the earth in rhythmic time , and his brothers urge him to his feet , put a jug of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Go-li-ath ! " <p> " Down ' em , bro ' . Down ' em . " <p> He sets first one , then the other , jug down on the table . If he were to walk down this mountaintop , walk north , might he not live a life in the desert ? Slay with his hands the wild beasts-lions and bears and crocodiles-all other men fear ; or perhaps pluck locusts and doves from the air ? His bones would ache from sleeping in the open ; loneliness would be his lot , but might it not be better than this ? <p> Lahmi fixes his eyes on him . The eyes of his brother are like the eyes of Asthah ; they are like his own eyes . If Samuel 's army routs the Philistines , what fate will befall them ? <p> He hoists a jug into the air , chugalugs down the wine within , repeats the action with the other jug . <p> " Go-li-ath ! Go-li-ath ! Go-li-ath ! " <p> Lahmi hands him another jug of wine , and then another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a spy for the Philistines , conies to their encampment , and gets led into the king 's tent . <p> " Of the giant they have word , and the more they whisper about him , the more his height increases . From six cubits to eight to nine : now the common soldiers say he is the very image of the colossus which bestrides the harbor at Rhodes . <p> " Their morale office brought in a doctor from U. of Bethlehem who delivered unto them a lecture , in which he spoke much of the excess of growth hormone which causeth giantism resulting in carpal tunnel syndrome , hypogonadism , lethargy , male lactation , cardiomyopathy-but afterwards I heard the soldiers aver to one another that it was all just so much BS to keep them from deserting . <p> " Another rumor hath gone round-started I believe by the brass when the lecture by the physician failed to soothe the men-that Goliath is not a man at all but a form of wood or wicker , clothed like a man and animated by guy wires and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common troops doth say : if they have the cleverness to create such a thing , which walketh and talketh and moveth like a man , had we not best fear them , and fear them sorely-for verily what other sorts of weapons might they have ? " <p> Goliath spins from all the wine . How sweet this addled dullness ! He gets led to the front of the encampment , paraded back and forth , men of normal height walking next to him . He sees the watch fires in the opposite valley flickering on the faces of his enemy . <p> Full night descends ; he half-staggers , is half-carried to his tent . In and out of drunken sleep , he hears the women camp followers playing psaltery , tabaret , pipe , and harp , their songs at times elegies for those who have fallen in battles past , at other times taunts directed at the opposite mountain : Our slaves were you once , and again will be . . . . Our god 's greater than your god , our god 's greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . . . . <p> His body being shaken . " The time is nigh . " <p> He groans and rolls over onto his side . <p> " Up , man . The army awaits . " Lahmi holds forth a cup of strong drink , " Hair of the dog that bit you . " <p> " Go ' way . " <p> Lahmi leans towards him , uses all his strength to hoist Goliath 's head up , raises the cup to his lips . " Drink , bro ' . Drink . The enemy masses upon the opposite hillside . Ye must arise . " <p> " We will win or we will lose . . . . " <p> " We will win . " <p> " Yesterday I scarce dared bid farewell to Asthah . I could not bear1 the look upon her face . " <p> " What need have you for fond farewells ? In yet a few hours , the enemy will be routed and you will be home . Sooner than this night shall you see Asthah again ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will she feed you figs and almonds and rub your skin with fragrant oils . " <p> " Ye speak with such great surety . Yet when a battle is undertaken who but Dagon knows where it shall end ? " <p> " Goliath , none of your philosophy . " <p> From outside the tent , Goliath hears the sounds of marching feet as the men form themselves into platoons and then squadrons . <p> Underneath their feet they trample wild sage and rotting figs , releasing smells both sharp and fetid into the air . <p>
