<p> On calm evenings , Betty Wonder can see the air she breathes . <p> Illuminated by city lights , a steady shower of tiny particles cascades down ' like talcum powder , ' she said , from the interstate above her home . <p> She calls it brake dust , but that is just one component . Her backyard air sometimes smells like dog food , courtesy of the Nestle Purina PetCare plant just across Interstate 70 . From the highway itself come all the compounds in exhaust fumes , plus road dust kicked up by 144,000 daily vehicles and the eroded tire and brake-drum particles produced by rush-hour traffic jams . <p> Then there are the various industries whose reported toxic emissions rank her part of Denver , by that measure , the most polluted urban area in Colorado . Thousands of diesel trucks also register the northern edge of Denver as their home . <p> Now she and many of her neighbors fear their air and their lungs will be sacrificed further for the sake of Colorado commuters . State and federal officials are studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one option is a toll road built above the elevated interstate already slicing their neighborhood in half . <p> Colorado 's governor is among those who think a two-deck highway could be the solution to I-70 traffic jams . Among those who do n't is Denver 's congresswoman , who threatened to lie down before the bulldozers in protest . <p> ' They 've got to do something , ' Wonder said , ' but I do n't think that 's the answer . It 'll just bring more pollution . They dump anything here . This is a dumping ground for anything nobody wants . ' <p> Hers is a common complaint in a Denver residential community divided by two interstates , crisscrossed by railroads , inundated by industries and bordered by refineries , a coal-burning power plant and half a dozen current or former hazardous-waste sites . <p> In Swansea , Elyria and Globeville , three neighborhoods in ZIP code 80216 , children play on school grounds shadowed by I-70 and in a city park beside the railroad tracks . <p> Their parents talk of the challenges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer rates but no medical clinics or pharmacies ; ice cream factories but no supermarket ; the aromas of smokestacks but no flower shop . <p> Yet these are also neighborhoods where families have stayed for generations , tending their homes and planting spring flowers in the face of encroaching industry . And at times , their protests have provoked a special degree of government attention . <p> In a first for its Rocky Mountain region , the federal Environmental Protection Agency has undertaken an environmental justice program designed to find innovative ways to improve the health and environment of minority neighborhoods in northern Denver . <p> Now , federal highway officials are being asked to consider the unprecedented step of calculating how the I-70 project could affect the health of neighborhoods . <p> Air and water quality evaluations normally precede federal highway projects . But because of neighborhood health concerns in north Denver , ' we 've asked if we can go beyond what we normally do , ' said Sharon Lipp , the Colorado Department of Transportation co- <p> project manager . <p> Her agency is preparing a $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in collaboration with Denver and the Regional Transportation District . <p> A family of asthmatics <p> Kathy Martinez is one of the neighborhood residents who fear traffic congestion will be relieved at a cost to the congested lungs of children . <p> Her grandson Brandon Herrera- <p> Martinez , a toddler with caramel eyes and tufts of baby hair , sits quietly on her lap , coughing occasionally , as she recalls the night he nearly died . <p> He was 5 months old . When he reached the hospital emergency room , ' his oxygen level was only at 55 percent , ' she said . <p> ' He spent his first Christmas in the hospital , and he came home on oxygen . Oxygen tank , tubes in his nose . a ' <p> Brandon , now nearly 2 , and his 3-year-old brother , Nathan , are the fourth generation of a family that came to the Swansea neighborhood 45 years ago - and the third generation suffering from a disease associated with unhealthy air . <p> ' All three of my children have asthma . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martinez said . ' Cousins grew up in the neighborhood with asthma as well . I do n't have anything to document it , ' but ' I think it 's because of the pollution in the area , I really do . ' <p> She was entering sixth grade when her mother and father , Isabelle and Roy Marquez , moved into a Denver home that looked east across empty fields toward Kansas . <p> ' This is why we bought this house , because there was nothing there , ' Isabelle Marquez said . ' Had we known . a ' <p> Before the 1990s , when the city finally paved their section of Cook Street , her family watered the street along with the lawn to control dust . <p> Now their view to the east consists of the truck , tire and heavy equipment businesses lining both sides of Vasquez Boulevard . Oil refineries and Xcel Energy 's Cherokee Station coal-fired power plant loom to the north , I-70 to the south . <p> ' We have to make do with what we have , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area that includes ' a lot of loyal neighbors - people who care about each other . ' <p> It does n't include a convenient place to buy food . Since the local Safeway closed decades ago , Martinez has driven to Adams County to shop . <p> Today , ' we still do n't have a real grocery store , ' she said , or a drugstore , or a doughnut or flower shop . ' We do have the lovely smell of Purina . We do have the smell of the refineries . That 's very fragrant . ' <p> Nestle Purina officials say there is nothing toxic in Purina 's emissions and odor complaints are rare . <p> Road of worries <p> Some north Denver residents say they were alarmed when Gov . Bill Owens spoke about putting a second deck over the I-70 viaduct to relieve traffic congestion from the Interstate 25/I-70 interchange east toward the growing suburbs and Denver International Airport . <p> ' Basically I do n't like the idea of another highway going over our head . This one is falling down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . ' <p> Holguin , a 23-year-old mother , said she fears a collision on the existing interstate could plunge a car into the Swansea Elementary School playground just north of the highway . She said she worries about the dust and fumes already pervading the neighborhood air , and their effect on her asthmatic stepson . <p> ' You can almost taste the pollution , ' she said . ' The smell can be awful in the evenings . ' <p> U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette , whose district includes those neighborhoods , said state transportation chief Tom Norton broached the idea of a two-deck highway . She replied that she would ' personally lie down in front of the bulldozers ' if Colorado tried . <p> Homeowners in Globeville , Swansea and Elyria ' have been subjected to pollution from the factories and the refineries ; their neighborhoods have already been bisected by the interstate , ' said DeGette , a Democrat . <p> ' I think it 's unbelievably insensitive to those neighborhoods to add to the environmental contamination and the noise and the isolation they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Colorado transportation officials emphasize that a two-deck highway is one of many options , including mass transit and a below- <p> ground interstate , to improve safety and lessen congestion between Denver and the airport . They estimate the project decision is three to five years away . <p> But in any event , officials say , the 40-year-old spans above the Elyria and Swansea neighborhoods should come down . At one meeting with transportation officials , neighborhood residents brought chunks of concrete that had fallen from the interstate . <p> That stretch of I-70 between Brighton and Colorado boulevards remains structurally safe today , but ' it 's basically a very old bridge , ' said Lipp , the state co- <p> project manager . ' It needs to be replaced sometime in the near future . ' <p> Dan Hopkins , Owens ' press secretary , said the governor remains open-minded about the interstate project . <p> Owens has seen elevated toll lanes over highways ' work in other states , ' Hopkins said . ' However , he feels it 's important to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One unresolved question is whether more lanes would necessarily mean more pollution . <p> ' Right now we ca n't say what two-tiering traffic would do , ' said Michael Silverstein , a senior planner at the state Air Pollution Control Division . ' If the cars are moving through faster , they 're not idling in traffic , we could see a decrease in emissions . ' <p> Cleaning up past ills <p> As state officials ponder health questions on a highway project , soil tests for hazardous wastes in north Denver have expanded from homes around Asarco , a Globeville smelter , to Elyria , Swansea and parts of adjoining neighborhoods . <p> Many yards hold trace amounts of poisonous elements : arsenic and lead . The resulting cleanup of a 4- <p> square-mile residential area known as the Vasquez Boulevard/ QJ0 <p> I-70 Superfund site is expected to remove 180,000 cubic yards of dirt from the yards of about 850 homes , much of it destined for the smelter 's industrial land . <p> Meanwhile , some homeowners fear the very ground they live on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited anxiously for five years , breathing with the help of an oxygen canister , for the bulldozer that ripped up his yard and replaced it with a foot of clean dirt and sod this month . <p> During the wait , ' we never did sit in the yard , ' his wife , Florence , said . ' I was afraid of it . ' <p> Lorraine Granado , a community organizer who grew up in the Swansea neighborhood , regularly gives a ' toxic tour ' of ZIP code 80216 to highlight what families here face . <p> Her tour begins with houses built beside the railroad tracks , where families live with nightly noise , fumes and vibrations . It goes to Swansea Elementary , where children play steps away from the elevated spans of I-70 . It passes city blocks where rows of industrial buildings sit directly across the street from homes with tricycles in the front yard and barbecue grills in back . <p> To the north , oil refineries , the power plant , its transmission lines and other heavy industries have spread across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends played as children . <p> ' It 's like the elephant that came and sat wherever he wanted to , ' she said . <p> Her tour heads south into Globeville past the ghostly buildings of the Asarco smelting plant , which deposited poisonous metals in the soil . Today , new homes with a hillside view of the old plant are being built on clean soil where hundreds of apartments were demolished . A pond beside the plant - where children played for years , she said - has been fenced . <p> Few homes remain in Elyria . Between industry and the interstate , its residential area has shrunk to a width of two blocks . In the neighborhood park , children are playing baseball across from a giant auto junkyard and a depot where diesel- <p> fueled Denver school buses park . <p> Railroad tracks form the back boundary of Swansea 's neighborhood park . A safety fence separates the park from the tracks , but it ends abruptly at the park 's edge . A few steps beyond the abbreviated fence there are tank cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> North of the park , where the tracks curve within 40 steps of the nearest homes , one tank car leaked hydrochloric acid in 1995 . Granado was among those who ran door to door that day , warning everyone to flee , as hazardous-materials crews arrived and police cordoned off their neighborhood . <p> A decade later , thanks to a lawsuit settlement , her neighborhood will get a new city park to compensate for that spill . <p> Yet as industry and interstate overtook much of their neighborhoods , many of the remaining residents are fixing up their houses . Fresh coats of paint , new siding and landscaped yards abound . In Globeville , young children bicycled in the street past a homeowner meticulously sweeping her alley . <p> ' You have these wonderful little houses . Surely they 're inexpensive . Surely they 're small , ' Granado said . ' But people take pride of ownership here . ' <p> More than toxic emissions <p> A Denver Post analysis of federal toxic-release data found that industries in ZIP code 80216 - encompassing Swansea , Globeville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - reported emitting 444,748 pounds of toxic compounds on site in 2001 . That was the highest emission level in any urban ZIP code in Colorado . <p> Some large suburban ZIP codes , such as the one encompassing the giant Coors brewery and a container plant near Golden , had higher emissions in 2001 , the most recent year for which toxic-release data are available . <p> Reported toxic emissions are only one measure of pollution . <p> They do not include the accumulated levels of lead and arsenic in north Denver yards . <p> Nor do they account for diesel fumes from trucks , which the EPA now regards as a particularly troubling ' mobile pollution ' source on the highways . <p> In north Denver , ' mobile sources may be a bigger problem ' than industrial emissions , EPA attorney Karen Kellen said . ' We found that 5,000 diesel trucks call their home there . It 's a lot of diesel traffic . That really adds to the overall picture . ' <p> Industry officials say they have significantly reduced neighborhood pollution exposures . <p> Emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Stutz said , but Cherokee Station has reduced three types of pollutants as technology has improved . Dennis Creamer , an official at the Suncor Energy refinery just outside ZIP code 80216 , said it has coupled emission reductions with community-based environmental projects in north Denver . <p> Health connection ? <p> State and federal officials say they know of no study tying disease rates in these neighborhoods to pollution exposure , and the Denver school system reports no unusual incidence of asthma in two neighborhood elementary schools . <p> A study of childhood cancer cases in Denver , however , concluded that children living near heavily traveled highways and streets ' may be at elevated risk of developing cancer , including leukemia , ' from benzene in motor vehicle exhaust fumes . That study was published in a technical journal in February 2000 . <p> Studies in other states have linked hospitalizations for childhood asthma to highway traffic and some lung cancers to diesel exhaust . <p> For two years , Kellen has been working on what she calls a unique environmental justice project for the Rocky Mountain regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money trying to establish whether pollution exposure has caused diseases in north Denver , the agency has searched for ways to reduce that exposure . <p> Those efforts have ranged from reducing refinery pollution to inspecting emissions of nearly every industry in the area to looking for ways to reduce exhaust from the heavy diesel traffic in the neighborhoods . <p> The EPA recognized that in Denver , as in much of the nation , ' low- <p> income and minority communities have historically been disproportionately impacted by environmental contaminants , ' Kellen said . ' We 're trying to find ways to level the playing field . ' <p> In 2002 , a state government cancer study of north Denver neighborhoods found that death rates were higher for certain cancers than elsewhere in the metro area . <p> Last November , a separate state study of the arsenic-contaminated neighborhoods in north Denver did not find that two cancers associated with arsenic exposure , lung and bladder , had increased as a result . <p> It did find , however , ' a generally higher than expected rate of cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as ' statistically elevated ' incidences of eight types of cancer . <p> High cancer rate , no clinic <p> The state studies attributed higher cancer rates partly to lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking , diet and alcohol use , but did not rule out environmental factors . <p> They also identified access to medical care as an issue . Men in north Denver were more likely to die of prostate cancer and women of cervical cancer , both diseases whose survival rates depend on early detection , and residents say there is no medical clinic in all of Globeville , Swansea and Elyria . <p> According to Lorraine Granado , Denver Health recently closed the last local one in Globeville . <p> Granado runs down a list of what the community of 10,000 Denver residents , mostly homeowners , largely Hispanic , many with children , does n't have : <p> ' No day-care center . No Laundromat . No retail shopping - we have bakeries . A couple of Mexican restaurants . No florist , coffee shops , gift shops . We do n't have a Kinko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , and ' we now have no clinic either . ' <p> Dr. Richard Wright , director of community health services for Denver Health , said the Globeville clinic was merged last year with a better-staffed clinic not far from the neighborhood . <p> ' I think it has actually increased the access , ' he said . <p> Near Betty Wonder 's home , house lots where her relatives once lived have been replaced by a barren patch of land littered with trash from I-70 . Beneath the highway , a homeless man sleeps on a decaying mattress . <p> ' All this trash , it just stays , ' she said , surveying the assortment of paper , plastic , cans , bottles , carpet pieces and old mattresses . ' The interstate pretty much ruined the neighborhood . ' <p> Her mother , who stayed in the house Wonder now shares with her son , died at age 66 . <p> ' My mother got leukemia , ' she said . ' The pollution , I do n't know if that had her stucco home came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has stopped trying to battle the sticky layer of dust that adheres to car and house . Her neighbors , a family of newcomers , have not . As Wonder watched in amazement , a young woman methodically washed the house next door with a garden hose . <p> " Anyway , it 's a home , " Wonder said , shrugging . " You learn to live with it . " <p> I-70 PROJECT MEETINGS <p> Two meetings with transportation officials are planned for people to learn more about the status of the Interstate 70 project : <p> May 12 at Montbello Recreation Center , 15555 E. 53rd Ave . <p> May 13 at Bruce Randolph Middle School , 3955 Steele St. <p> The meetings are from 5 to 8 p.m. and will include small-group discussions .
