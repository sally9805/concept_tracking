Bling By ERICA KENNEDY MIRAMAX BOOKS ERICA KENNEDY JOHNSON Chapter One Excuse Me Miss " ' CAUSE WE AI N'T NOBODY , " LaToya said . Lakeesha turned from peering out the window of the Chesterfield Hotel , annoyed because her question- " Why they got us staying in this bum-ass hotel ? " - had been a rhetorical one . There was no view . Just another hotel across Thirty-seventh Street . And From what little she could see , the rooms over there were nicer . " I know , " Keesha said . " But still ... we did n't even get a limo from the airport . " " We did n't need a limo , " Mimi said , busily straightening up . " They sent a car and it was fine . " " Why are you cleaning up Kenny 's room ? " Keesha said , stretching out on the perfectly made bed . " Because I already finished with ours , " Mimi said . " I ca n't just sit around , doing nothing , waiting for the phone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sharing the adjoining room but they were camped out here because their manager , Kenny Hill , would get the call-at the hotel since his cell-phone service had been interrupted for nonpayment-and they wanted to be there when he did . " Let 's eat , " Keesha said . " That 'll give us something to do . " She picked up the room service menu . " We can order food , right ? " She frowned over at Toya . " They pay for that ? " Last night after their audition at the Triple Large offices they had gone to Planet Hollywood for dinner , hoping to spot some celebrities , unaware that itwas a tourist trap populated by autographseekers like themselves where no celebrity would ever be caught dead . " I do n't know , " Toya said wearily . Keesha was always looking for a free meal , literally and figuratively , and it got under Toya 's skin that she was so simpleminded . " You need to ask Kenny . " " Where 's he at anyway ? " Keesha said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It do n't take that long to buy a pack of Newports . " Mimi did n't care about the low-budget accommodations or that there had been no limo yesterday . Keesha thought this whole trip was going to be like an episode of Making the Band-she was obsessed with that show ! Kenny did nothing to dissuade her from thinking it was going to be limos , parties , and Cristal bottles popping , but why on earth would anyone do that for them ? They were nobodies . But they had come here to change that . They 'd all met at Performing Arts School of Toledo . They joked they were like TLC , whose CrazySexyCool album was one of their all-time favorites . Keesha , big-boned and equipped with a razor-sharp tongue , was the crazy component . Toya , a round-faced girl with a heart-warming smile and a degree of self-assurance that belied her years , was the cool . And Mimi ... well , she was n't wild like Keesha and she did n't possess Toya 's innate confidence , so sometimes she felt she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mimi was pretty . Since she was a baby everyone had remarked on it . But in her usual baggy gear , sexy she was not . Tight jeans and midriff-baring tops invited attention , and as a biracial girl in a predominantly black school , she already stood out enough . All she 'd ever wanted was to blend in . Her mother , Angela , was Italian , and Mimi could n't remember her Haitian father . Jacques Bertrand had run out on Angela a year after their only child was born , and the annual birthday cards that had arrived ( late ) with no return address stopped arriving altogether after Mimi 's eighth birthday . She kept the details of her home life to herself as she did most things , managing to pull straight As while dodging the taunts of " white girl " and " high-yellow heifer . " As if she thought she was better than the other girls . Just like many of them , she was raised by an overworked single mother , she rode the bus to school from the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran a disapproving " you think you cute " eye were paid for by the after-school jobs she 'd been juggling since she was fourteen . She never made her looks an issue , they did . Toya , however , was different . She made that clear only two months into freshman year , when Nichelle Griffin had stormed over to Mimi in the cafeteria and began to lay into her for coming on to her boyfriend ( even though it had been Nichelle 's wannabe teenage lothario who had been coming on to a completely uninterested Mimi ) . Toya , who Mimi knew only casually , had calmly looked over her shoulder from the next table and said , " You just mad because you wish you had that long hair . Go get yourself a weave and shut the hell up . " Keesha , always spoiling for a fight of any kind , had jumped up to enter the fray but Nichelle had slunk away before she could . Toya , Keesha , and Mimi had been friends ever since . Later that year , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated endlessly about what kinds of songs they should sing , what kind of group they wanted to be . Keesha and Toya were into hip-hop . Mimi 's tastes fell more on the soul side . She idolized those female artists whose songs stirred something inside her more than an urge to dance . Her mother had harbored dreams of being a singer way back when and music was the only constant in their unstable lives . From Aretha to Alanis Morissette , Sarah Vaughan to Sarah McLachlan , Mimi would close her eyes and try to mimic their every inflection , pretending she was them , not a girl from Toledo who would n't recognize her own father if she passed him on the street . That was how she got through performing onstage . She became someone else-whoever 's song she was belting out . She was pretending to be Beyonce on the night they met Kenny at a local talent show ; Heartsong had just won the top prize and three hundred dollars for their rousing rendition of " Bills , Bills , Bills , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-four with droopy eyes and a seemingly permanent deposit of white crust in the corner of his mouth , Kenny Hill 's name was one they recognized from flyers posted all over town . A part-time club promoter , he told them he knew every musician , nightclub owner , and DJ in Toledo . Which in retrospect , they realized , was n't saying all that much . He proffered a business card that read simply " talent manager " and they did n't know to ask him for any credentials beyond the promises he made . He talked about getting them a record deal and he did n't ask them for money , and so it was that Kenny Hill became their manager . He had arranged for them to sing backup on demos at Wildside Studios in exchange for free studio time to record their own music . He kept telling them that he was setting up auditions with labels but nothing ever panned out . And they 'd graduated high school two years ago ! The day after they tossed their caps , Mimi 's part-time job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing hair at Black Roots ( without a license ) , and Keesha was n't doing much of anything except hanging out with her crazy-ass drug-dealer boyfriend . They 'd finished their demo , using tracks Kenny bought from a local producer and singing generic R &B; lyrics that Kenny had written himself . Kenny Hill-club promoter , talent manager , songwriter . Jack of all trades and master of none . When he finally got a callback from Triple Large Entertainment a week ago , he did n't tell the girls right away that they had a chance at a recording contract . Instead he 'd gotten everything in order-wrangling four coach plane tickets to New York , two $99-per-night rooms at The Chesterfield-before he strolled into Wildside Studios and crowed triumphantly , " Pack your bags , girls . We 're goin ' to New York ! " CALL THE GIRL ? Why did Lamont always have to be so dramatic ? Daryl wanted to call the girl but he could n't even remember the bitch 's name ! La-something . Lavonne ? No , LaToya . Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamont 's assistant and the receptionist if they remembered the name of the " pretty one " because he could n't find the group 's bio and attached photo . With all the groups that had come through the office in the last few weeks , no one could remember a damn thing about any of them . Now Daryl rummaged through all the useless office memos on his desk in search of the package the manager had left with him the other day . Daryl 's office was tiny . So was he . But what he lacked in size he more than made up for in self-aggrandizement . He was five foot five and three-quarters of an inch , but whenever anyone dared to question his height he 'd pull out his driver 's license . Bam ! Five foot seven . People always took that as gospel , as if the DMV actually measured folks . His office would have felt larger if he 'd cleared out the half dozen boxes of demos he was supposed to listen to as the A &R; rep of Triple Large Entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know what A &R; stood for . " Artist and repertoire " he was told . He still did n't entirely understand , but he 'd figured out he was expected to discover new artists and work on their development once they were signed . That he could do , although he really wanted to be a producer solely and forget the office bullshit . He rarely got around to assessing the volumes of material that found their way into the midtown office . Most artists who got signed had already made names for themselves on the street or were affiliated with an established hip-hop clique . The next big thing rarely arrived unannounced via the United States Postal Service . Nevertheless , Paul Mankewich , the label 's V.P. of A &R,; stayed on Daryl 's ass about listening to every single submission . A strapping , floppy-haired white guy in his mid-thirties , Paul Mankewich made six figures and his own hours . He was nicknamed " Witchy " because he had successfully cultivated so many R &B; and hip-hop acts at various record companies that people said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have an official title . He was usually called " the A &R; guy , " which he preferred to being called Witchy 's assistant . Though affable to most , Witchy cracked the whip on his departmental subordinate-mostly , Daryl believed , as a form of insurance . If Witchy failed to meet his monthly beat-up-on-Daryl quota , Witchy was guaranteed to receive a few lashes from the HNIC himself , Lamont " Fat Man " Jackson . Daryl idolized and despised Fat Man with equal fervor . Some days he wished he were standing tall in Lamont 's four-hundred-dollar shoes , making big moves and bigger bank . Other days he hoped Lamont Jackson would keel over and die from a massive coronary and spend all eternity rotting in hell . A few months ago , Fat Man had put out the call that they 'd be branching out into R &B.; They were hoping to find the next Destiny 's Child . In the past two months , they 'd seen twenty-seven groups . None of them got past their first song . After an audition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pink hair who called themselves Shades , it was obvious Witchy was digging at the bottom of the barrel . Lamont had turned to Witchy and said , " Mr. Mankewich , why do I feel like I 'm a judge on American Idol ? " Daryl had fallen back on Lamont 's sofa and laaaaaughed . It was a joy to see Witchy catching some flak for a change , but the most hysterical part was that Lamont was beginning to resemble the fat guy on the show . And then this group Heartsong-the worst fucking name ! - had come in yesterday . Daryl had only listened to their demo as a favor to Meagan , Triple Large 's certified hottie receptionist . She 'd urged him to listen to it , saying the manager was a friend of her cousin 's friend . " Oh well , I 'll give it the VIP treatment right now ! " Daryl had clowned . Like he cared . It was certain to be garbage , but if it brought him one small step toward getting some pussy from Meagan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , it was n't bad . Not bad at all . Witchy was heated when he found out Daryl had flown them in without consulting him . One of the girls , the one with the long braids , had to be twenty pounds heavier than she 'd been when the bio picture was taken . And the manager was annoying as hell ! Daryl had to shove him out of Lamont 's office as he tried to sell him on two other hip-hop acts he managed . The group 's audition did n't seem to ignite much enthusiasm in Lamont although he did n't say that he straight-up hated them , which was his response to most of the twenty-seven who 'd come before . This morning Lamont had called Daryl-at the crack of dawn-to say maybe they did n't need a group after all . Actually his first words were " Where the hell is Witchy ? " Daryl rolled over , looked at the ungodly hour and yawned , " At home sleepin ' maybe ? " Lamont grunted his disapproval , then told Daryl he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they needed just one girl . A solo artist . He wanted to meet with the lead singer of Heartsong . " The pretty one , " he 'd said . Daryl finally found the bio picture ticking out of a stack of magazines on the floor . Mimi . That was her name . He looked at his fake Rolex . Damn ! It was already 4:15 and Lamont wanted her down there by 5:00 . He picked up the phone and dialed the hotel . This chick could be his first discovery . And if a signing came out of this , he would n't let Witchy or Fat Man forget it . Chapter Two If I Ruled the World LAMONT CLIMBED THE WINDING STAIRCASE to his home gym , thinking , Lamont Jackson , Chairman of Augusta Music . Had a nice ring to it . He 'd be able to sell Triple Large to Augusta but he 'd still retain control of the label he 'd founded as well as run several others . How much would the deal reap ? Sixty million ? No , Triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treadmill and poked a few buttons . He usually worked out in the evening after coming home from the office and before going out for dinner and whatever else the night offered . But today he 'd come home right after his lunch meeting with Irv . One of the perks of being a top dawg-you did n't have to account for your whereabouts to anyone . These workouts were often the only time he spent alone in an entire day . At the office he had his minions swarming around and his faithful assistant , Imani , hovering nearby . At night , out at the most exclusive clubs , his entourage was always surrounding him . When traveling in his Maybach or Suburban ( money green , fully loaded ) , his driver , Carlos , was at the wheel . And when he finally fell asleep in this TriBeCa triplex , there was almost always a gorgeous babe in bed beside him . He had tried working out with a highly recommended personal trainer , but the guy had annoyed him and was fired after two sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
