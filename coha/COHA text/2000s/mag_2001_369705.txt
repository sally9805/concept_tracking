Having once riled Mayor Rudolph Giuliani with the " Sensation " show , the Brooklyn Museum has done it again with Renee Cox 's Yo Mama 's Last Supper , in which Cox features herself naked in the place of Christ . It 's all just so much stale postmodern show biz , slick and corny at the same time . Do n't let it divert you from Bob Greene 's hot shots of Papua New Guinea or Beuford Smith 's Hip-Hop poster series , highlights in an otherwise benign but mostly unremarkable show . <P>  --  By Richard Lacayo
