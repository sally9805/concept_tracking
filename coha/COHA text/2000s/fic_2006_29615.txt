Chapter One Last night I killed a man . Pulled a garrote and sliced it into his tight white throat . Held it while the blood bloomed scarlet . He gasped and struggled , breath gurgling . His knees , once strong enough to hold his weight , now shuddered . They toppled and fell . His eyes , whites wide and full of terrible knowledge , stared up at me from the floor where he lay . I watched him die . * * * Moonlight washed the path with a low glow . The man checked his watch and peered out from behind the clump of trees . He tightened his hold on a branch , gaze riveted on the dirt trail . She would come . He 'd been assured of it . And when she did , he 'd be right behind her . Automatically , he felt the knife on his thigh . Just under the rim of his running shorts . Handy . Easy to reach . Soon . She would be coming soon . * * * A scream ripped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of the ceiling . Dark room . No light . Sweat . She was sweating . Something had woken her . Noise ? Blood thudded in her ears . Was that it ? She burrowed inside her head . Dream images . Darkness blurred . Faces smeared . People ? Person . Was someone screaming ? She listened hard . All was quiet . Street light filtered in through a window . One by one she ticked off the gloom-filled surroundings : dresser , mirror , rocking chair in corner . Clothes over the chair arm . Hers . Of course , hers . She was home.In her bedroom . Yet ... was it her bedroom ? It was dark . Why was it dark ? She snapped on the light , and it stabbed through her eyes into her brain . She turned it off , collapsed back down , stared up at the ceiling again . A hammer pounded her skull . Headaches were unusual . At least ... she thought they were . Why was n't she sure ? She sat up , groaning . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 am in digital green . She ran two fingers over her brow , pressed in the sides . Aspirin . She should take some aspirin . She put her feet on the floor and stood . A wave of dizziness gripped her and she stumbled to the chair for her robe . A pair of running shorts and a tank top were draped over the arm , sneakers stuffed with athletic socks sat on the floor . Running . Fresh air , outdoors . The call was fierce and compelling . She could no more resist it than she could resist breathing . Aspirin forgotten , she slipped the clothes on . Immediate relief poured through her . Pulling her tangled hair into a rough ponytail , she staggered down the stairs , and let herself out the front door . The night washed her with cool , gentle air . She gulped it in , feeling better , much better . Setting off down the street , she started off slow , gradually increasing the pace until her legs pumped strength into the rest of her . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was automatic , unthinking . Down the block and around the corner . What she had to do . Was meant to do . Another three blocks and the park loomed to the left , the entrance a black mouth waiting to gobble her up . She headed for it unerringly , breathing easy , legs sure . Dumbarton Oaks Park . It closed at dark , the sign said so , but she plunged past it , unable to stop even if she wanted to . Here and there the city had put up a light , but for the most part the trail was dim , lit only by the moon . But her feet were sure , the path as familiar as the way home . She 'd been here before . At the second bend she headed right , and the first prickle ran over her . She stretched her ears , listening hard . Heard nothing but her own steps . She slowed , then picked up the pace . Branches brushed by , naked and bony against the moonlight . An owl screeched . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no one . Only the dim shade of the path behind her . She plowed on , turning into the track that bordered the creek . The name drifted into her head . Rock Creek . Water gurgled . Swooshed and fell like dark music . Shaking off the jitters , she pounded over the wood bridge . Her feet had just hit the trail again when she sensed him . She checked behind , saw no one , turned back around . Ahead of her , a man had appeared on the trail , bent over one knee and blocking the way . Too late , her foot slammed into him and she went up and over , landing with a thud . She grunted with the impact , but in the next instant , she 'd sprung back up , crouched , ready . A distant part of her mind wondered how she 'd done that . The rest focused on the man as he stood and backed away , limping . " Whoa . It 's okay . I 'm harmless . " He held his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry . New shoes . " He pointed to his runners with one of his hands , keeping the other still raised . " Twisted my damn ankle . " She watched him warily , not moving . " I ... uh ... did n't see you coming . " He smiled tentatively . " Did n't know anyone else was crazy enough to run this time of night . You all right ? " Slowly , she straightened , unclenched her fists . " Fine . " " Good . " He ran a hand over his head with a sheepish expression . " Look , I uh ... do n't suppose you 'd give me a hand ? My car is at the bottom of the trail , but my ankle 's pretty messed up . " He was tall , wiry rather than broad , with long athletic legs under loose , knee-length basketball shorts . His shirt was tied around his waist , so she could see his upper body . No weapons . Why did she even notice that ? Better to notice that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out or was used to physical labor . His hair , clipped tight to his skull , did n't hide much . Military , came the word in her head , and instantly she felt less threatened . Why was that ? " Sure , " she said , and a voice inside her head said , you could take him if you had to . Take him where ? How ? He untied his shirt , slipped it on , winced as he limped toward her . Gingerly , he wrapped an arm over her shoulder . " Thanks . " They started off , him using her body to offset the pressure on his bad foot . " I 'm Jake , by the way . Jake Wise . " " Margo Scott . " The name came to her easily . Why should n't it ? " You looked pretty scary back there , Margo . For a minute I thought you were going to take my eyes out . You some kind of karate expert ? " The question echoed in her head , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Then , as though it had been there all along , the response came . She shook her head . " A bookseller . I own a store in Old Town . You ? " " Lawyer . " He grunted the word , stumbling over a branch . " Here . Georgetown . " Neither construction worker nor soldier . She was vaguely surprised . " You should stick to a track . " " Do n't I know it . Friend told me about this place . Was working late . Thought I 'd try out my shoes . " He smiled grimly . " I 've had better ideas . " His car was parked on the street just outside the park entrance . She helped him to the driver 's side , and he fished out a set of keys from a pocket inside his shorts . He opened the door , propped himself against it , and hopped around to face her . " Can I give you a lift ? I owe you . " " That 's okay . I only live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He shrugged . " Suit yourself . " He slipped into the seat . " Appreciate the help . " " No problem . Take it slow going home . Ice down that ankle . " " Will do . " He closed the door , rolled down the window . " Thanks again . " She nodded and watched him drive away . Her headache was gone . ( Continues ... )
