The arrival of an exceptional new hotel on Kiawah Island has the golf and beach resort buzzing . By Simone Girner // I EMBARKED ON MY FIRST trip to South Carolina 's Kiawah Island Golf Resort with trepidation . I knew that Kiawah , one of the country 's largest golf and beach developments , located on a 10,000-acre barrier island some twenty miles south of Charleston , was a cherished American classic-a Southern seaside resort that discerning travelers , particularly golfers , had sought out since the seventies . As a relatively young newcomer , and a non-golfer to boot , I felt intimidated by Kiawah 's history , by its place among the leading U.S. resorts . It seemed too late to " join the club , " where , I feared , clued-in members would greet each other with secret handshakes and proof of previous visits would be required at the door . As it turned out , I could not have been more wrong . Instead of finding an insiders-only atmosphere , I discovered a resort that was not only a welcoming-and charmingly Southern-host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renaissance , thanks to a special hotel that opened its doors on the island last August . Initially , the announcement of the construction of the $125 million Sanctuary , the most expensive hotel ever built in South Carolina , was met with a mix of anticipation and anxiety among residents and longtime visitors . After all , the Kiawah Island Golf Resort had been developed slowly and deliberately by a series of owners since it opened with one golf course and the small Kiawah Island Inn ( now closed ) in 1976 , and even though a five-star property seemed overdue for this esteemed vacation destination , some people worried that a luxury hotel might irrevocably change the island 's unpretentious nature . Luckily , RiverStone , which now owns the Kiawah resort and oversaw the building of the Sanctuary , was as invested in preserving the area 's historic value as it was in providing modern-day travelers with spa treatments and wireless Internet access . The road leading to the hotel is lined by tall oak trees , whose gnarled branches and thick , leafy canopies give them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The feeling of driving through ancient grounds is a clever illusion , however , for the lush landscape surrounding the hotel is as carefully composed as its cream-colored facade . Adhering to island policy , which forbids the removal of trees unless they are replaced or replanted , the hotel developer moved the property 's more than 150 oaks into their current places using the world 's largest mechanical spade . Though moving them was costly , the replanted oaks provide sun-dappled mood lighting before guests set foot in the lobby and beautifully reflect the hotel 's commitment to blending into Kiawah 's natural and emotional environment . The four-story estate-whose exterior showcases a mix of local materials like slate , Charleston-style brick and copper-evokes a private Southern mansion from the past , an ambience that continues in the interior . The spacious sitting rooms are dotted with 19th-century antiques ; formal , Sargent-inspired portraits preside over carved limestone fireplaces ; and the hand-distressed walnut floorboards are laid in such a way that they creak softly as you walk on them . Leading to the hotel 's east and west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up visions of Southern belles descending with frilly hoop skirts . Despite the decidedly grand interiors , the Sanctuary was designed first and foremost for seaside relaxation , not formal afternoon tea , and the vibe here is one of low-key elegance . It helps that guests , instead of being met by a check-in desk , are welcomed by a fantastic ocean view , thanks to the lobby 's huge windows that fling the greens , blues and grays of the Atlantic into the space . ( Like the oak-lined entrance path , this seemingly natural panorama was painstakingly constructed , as the hotel site had to be raised from a height of seven feet to twenty feet to allow for this vista . ) Ocean views also dominate many of the 255 guest rooms , the smallest of which clock in at 520 square feet . Complete with custom-made furnishings as well as marble bathrooms with deep bathtubs and walk-in showers , the Sanctuary 's rooms are truly comfortable . There are lovely details to be found throughout , like the shuttered bathroom windows that open onto the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed . Techies and workaholics were also considered : rooms have flat-screen televisions , DVD and CD players , and the hotel 's Wi-Fi Internet access extends all the way down to the beach . Every room conies with either a private terrace or a patio , but make sure to book on the upper floors ( the corner suites are particularly winning ) , as public walkways pass in front of the ground-floor accommodations , and I can vouch for the fact that nothing interrupts a quiet seaside reverie like a group of fellow guests marching by . Serious golfers love staying at the Sanctuary for another , very simple , reason : guests get preferred tee-time privileges at the island 's five award-wining courses ( all par 72s ) . Battling it out on Pete Dye 's wickedly difficult Ocean Course , which hosted the unforgettable 1991 Ryder Cup and the 2003 World Cup , is certainly at the top of any devotee 's wish list . Insiders also rave about the Jack Nicklaus-designed Turtle Point Course , with its lovely new clubhouse , and the Tom Fazio-designed Osprey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around four lakes and through glistening saltwater marshes . Before coming to Kiawah , I had never been tempted to pick up a club , but the beauty of these island courses and the warm staff at the Golf Academy ( nineteen are PGA teaching professionals ) had me longing for more time so I could indulge in a first lesson . There 's plenty to do for the nongolfer as well ; active island pursuits include canoeing and kayaking on marsh creeks , tennis ( Kiawah was recently ranked the No. 1 U.S. tennis resort by Tennis magazine ) and bike tours along thirty miles of meticulously groomed trails . I missed going bird-watching with a naturalist-the island is blessed with more than 220 avian species-but I saw white herons , hawks and an egret during my own excursions . Also living on Kiawah are some 400 alligators , a fact I discovered on my first day when a woman walking a large dog stopped me on my bike , pointed in the direction from which I was coming and asked , " Any alligators ahead ? " After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " taunt or feed " the gators had me hiking a touch faster ( and wondering who would attempt either one ) . While the great Kiawah outdoors beckon , the Sanctuary also offers serious pampering at the end of ( or instead of ) an active day . I spent a blissful afternoon at the hotel 's spa-which has twelve sunny treatment rooms , a long list of facial and body therapies and a well-equipped fitness center-and not once did I worry about missing out on other activities . By the main pool , which has a bubbling fountain at its center , I overheard an athletic-looking man confessing to his companion that he was taking the day off from the links . He did n't sound one bit sorry . The beach that unfolds in front of the hotel like a silky sarong was the ideal place for an early-morning yoga session followed by a bike ride on the firm sand ( ten miles of pristine shoreline wrap around the island ) . The opening of the Sanctuary also expanded the island 's dining options , which had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn 's small restaurant . The Ocean Room , the hotel 's signature restaurant , may be a touch too formal for the breezy island setting-it features an abundance of dark mahogany , heavy chandeliers and a jackets-required policy-but chef Chris Brandt 's New American cuisine is excellent , particularly his creative take on seafood . I personally preferred the more casual Jasmine Porch , with its exposed brick walls , humming ceiling fans and white-oak floors . Sitting on the candlelit porch with a steaming plate of Charleston shrimp and grits before me , I barely recalled that both the Sanctuary and I had just recently arrived on Kiawah . On my final day , I wandered into the sales office of the Kiawah Island Development Partners , where I was not surprised to learn that the approximately fifty plots released for construction annually are always snapped up immediately . In the back of the office hung a detailed Kiawah time line that described how in 1782 a progressive general named Nathaniel Greene negotiated a truce with the British for the island . Kiawah , he decided , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safe haven from the Revolution 's battlefields . Driving away from the Sanctuary through the rows of replanted oak trees , I thought about how appropriate it was that this enchanting place on South Carolina 's coast had been a sanctuary some two centuries before modernday travelers discovered and reclaimed it as such . I could only imagine the stories those lofty trees might tell . Kiawah Island Golf Resort is a forty-five-minute drive from Charleston , South Carolina .
