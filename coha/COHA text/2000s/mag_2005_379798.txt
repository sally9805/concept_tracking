At 3 , Alice Waters was sent off to a party wearing a radish bracelet , strawberry necklace and lettuce-leaf skirt assembled from her parents ' Victory garden . It was the beginning of a lifetime of involvement with fresh foods . Chez Panisse , the restaurant she opened in Berkeley , Calif. , in 1971 , ranks among the best in the country . As a chef and food activist , she " may be the most influential figure in the past 30 years of the American kitchen , " says Gourmet magazine . Waters , 61 , talked with TIME 's BARBARA ISENBERG about why consuming and appreciating natural foods is so important . <P> What sparked your passion for the table and its pleasures ? <P> I had an awakening when I went to France at 19 . People were living in a way that seemed to me so rich and layered in terms of experience . I knew it had something to do with eating , because French people spend a lot of time at the table  --  at the caf in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven into their everyday experience . I got seduced by that . <P> Food is considerably less central to American lives , is n't it ? <P> We have a very disconnected way of thinking about food . In other countries I have visited , people think of food as something precious and meaningful in their lives . But we have been closed in by a very narrow experience of eating  --  wanting everything the same all the time , whatever country we 're in . <P> Is it also a matter of seeing food as fuel and fast foods as convenience ? <P> We Americans have never really connected food to agriculture and nature . Food has always remained in the category of maintenance . Do this  --  not with any particular pleasure  --  and as quickly and cheaply as possible . We have to get food out of that place of maintenance , where we overindulge or deny ourselves . We need to bring ourselves into a new relationship with food that connects to the seasons and nature and to our culture and traditions . <P> How might we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the store , I buy pots of herbs . I keep them on a back step or in the kitchen , and they last . They are everything to my cooking . You can change the way tomatoes are cut and which herbs go on them , and it tastes like a new dish each time . Also , when you go to the market , you can see what 's there and then decide what to cook . You may want a soup and that 's fine , but you may not know what kind of soup until you see what is seasonal , ripe or beautiful . <P> Are you encouraged by the growth in farmers ' markets and organic-food stores ? <P> Yes . Today you can find a farmers ' market a couple of times a week in every midsize city in the country . Things are sold when they 're ripe , generally , and people are allowed to taste and judge for themselves . You learn which is the Red Haven peach and which the Faye Alberta , and you can become very sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't , you 're likely to experience great-tasting food because it is ripe , fresh and in season . The organic movement is said to be growing 300% a year in the U.S. , which leads me to believe that people are really hungry for not only the food but also the values that come along with it . <P> How would you describe the larger implications of the " slow food " movement ?
