I WAS N'T SNOOPING . I 'VE read all the advice books and know that children need their privacy . But Tommy had been using the car the night before , and my keys were nowhere to be found , so I looked in his room . <p> Unlike the stereotypical teenage boy , Tommy keeps his room fairly neat . Oh , the bed was unmade , but there was n't any dirty laundry on the floor or used dishes on the desk . A quick glance showed that the keys were n't on his bedside table or the dresser . <p> I started looking in drawers . Perhaps he had put them away without thinking . The top dresser drawer held nothing but socks , and the desk drawer had been missing ever since my husband bought the thing for his first apartment . That left the bedside table . <p> The bedside table drawer held a stack of magazines ( two copies of Rolling Stone covering up a Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue and a Penthouse ; maybe I was snooping just a little ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colored pencils , some pennies , and a matchbox . Inside the matchbox were nine little green triangular pills . I knew exactly what they were , too . Efracol . The seduction pill . <p> After all , I 'd invented it . <p> The name " Efracol " was n't my doing . Some marketing person at Wellaxo came up with that , presumably by pulling Scrabble tiles out of a hat . Its full name is Dibutyl Catecholandrogen , and it first came to my attention during my postdoctoral research at Duke . <p> My thesis project back at Penn had been on neurohormones - a class of messenger molecules which could function both as neurotransmitters and as hormones . I had hoped that the study of neurohormones might clarify the ancient mind/body problem . I 'm firmly a materialist , by the way . I believe that all questions of consciousness and thought can be ultimately answered by the study of the brain . <p> When I got my degree in 1997 , 1 started looking around for a post-doc position . Morris Fischbein at Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great guy . Most tenured researchers like him treat their grad students and post-does as so much unpaid labor , to be rewarded with co-author status on a paper along with the other twenty members of the team . Not Morris . He did his own work - wonderful , groundbreaking work on the formation of synaptic pathways - and let the others in his lab do what they wanted . <p> He was also a fountain of ideas . He once showed me his notebook , an old black grade-school composition book with pages and pages of topics to explore . " I 'm not generous , " he said . " I 'm lazy . I 'll never live long enough to do all these experiments . By giving the ideas away , I can find out what I want to know without doing any of the work . " <p> One of the ideas jotted down in his neat print was " EMOTIONS how does a mental state have a physiological effect ? Neurohormones ? " <p> I took that one and ran with it . <p> Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick fairly basic emotions to study . Shame , loyalty , or jealousy would be too complicated . How do you make a rat jealous ? So I stuck to the basics - things like fear , anger , or arousal . <p> In the end paperwork determined what emotion I studied . Any work with live animals requires a stack of forms a yard high from the Animal Care people . To make my rats frightened or angry would have needed another three-foot stack . But since rats have sex all the time , I did n't need to fill out any forms beyond the initial load in order to study their mating behavior . So I decided to look for the biochemical basis of arousal . <p> Years later , Morris told me , " I remember thinking that your project was the kind of thing only a woman would do . Male scientists would be too embarrassed to admit they were studying what makes a rat horny . " <p> If you want the whole story , you can read my Scientific American article in the November 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work and fifty or sixty dead rats , I had a molecule . Dibutyl Catecholandrogen , or DBCA for short . I could inject a female rat with DBCA and within fifteen minutes she would begin exhibiting all the signs of readiness to mate - ear twitching , lordosis , lubrication . It did n't matter if the nearest male rat was two floors up and on the other side of a concrete wall . Even spayed rats with no uterus or ovaries would respond . <p> I published my results in the Spring 2001 issue of Biochemistry . A week after it appeared I got a phone call . <p> " Dr. Pickens ? My name is Dave Zhao . I 'm a researcher up at Wellaxo . " The name was vaguely familiar . The world of science is still a small town . " You did a paper on autocoids at the Gordon Conference . " <p> " That 's right . I saw your Biochemistry piece about catecholandrogens . Really neat stuff . Anyway , I 'm part of a team working on treatments for sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you be interested in helping us out ? " <p> Researchers in academia always drool over the resources and money available in industry . I tried to sound calm and professional . " I 'd be very interested . " <p> So for the next six months I split my time between Duke and Wellaxo , and did n't get nearly enough sleep . Tommy was in second grade at Durham Academy , and Jonathan was trying to earn enough as a reporter for the News &; Observer to pay the school 's tuition , with a little left over for food and the mortgage . My stipend as an outside consultant with Dave 's team was a big help . <p> My real contributions came at the beginning of the project . I showed Dave and his group how to extract DBCA , and helped come up with a way to synthesize it . I had been concerned with how it worked rather than the structure of the molecule , but the Wellaxo , people needed to know how to build DBCA from scratch . My consulting contract ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly stayed in touch by e-mail . I was looking for a tenure-track job , I was pregnant with Natasha , and the lab had been invaded by MDs preparing the human trials , so there really was n't anything for me to do anyway . <p> The first human trials were done in the spring of 2002 . Dave was kind enough to call me up with the results . " It was amazing , Claudia . We had fifty people in all . Twenty women with sexual dysfunctions , twenty healthy women students from NC State , and ten male volunteers . Half of each set got DBCA . " <p> " How often ? " <p> " Weekly doses over ten weeks . And the results were really something ! The dysfunctionals went from an average of one sexual partnering every month to once a week . But the healthy subjects all went way up . The weekly average beforehand was one point two . Are you sitting down ? " " Yes , why ? " <p> " The average with DCBA was five point seven partnerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a second for me to process that . " Five point seven ? I do n't believe it . What kind of dosage were you using ? " <p> " Five micrograms . About two point five parts per billion blood concentration . " <p> The same as in my rats . " My God , Dave . Those women would have to be having sex every night to get averages like that. , , <p> " One subject reported an average of eight point nine per week on DBCA . " There was a note of glee in his voice . <p> " Jesus . What about the men ? " <p> " They went from an average of one point four to an average of one point eight . And get this - the men in the control group increased by almost the same amount , to one point seven . I 'm thinking placebo effect . " <p> " Probably . Did the tablets work out , or did you have to inject them ? " " Oh , the tablets worked great . Very fast absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the healthy volunteers . Down the hatch , and boom ! Ten horny women . " <p> " It worked that way with the rats , but I thought humans might be a little more restrained . Maybe you should cut the dose for the next round . " <p> " Oh yes . We 're making up a batch of two mike tablets , and I 'm going to put out a general call for volunteers . We 'll run a six-month test , and then the Marketing people want to start clinical trials . " <p> " Clinical trials already ? Dave , maybe we should go a bit more slowly with this . " <p> " Are you kidding ? Claudia , think of all those aging Boomer women hitting menopause . This could be really big . The Legal people have filed already with the FDA for approval to start . Oh , and Marketing came up with a new name : Efracol . " <p> " Efracol ? That 's a dumb name . What 's the matter with DBCAV ? " " Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techs call it . TFD . " <p> " TFD ? " <p> " The Fuck Drug . " <p> I WAS WAITING for Tommy when he got home ( I never did find the car keys , so I wound up calling a cab ) . He stowed his bike in the garage and came in through the laundry room to the kitchen , where I was sitting . " Tommy , come here . " <p> He must have caught the note of anger in my voice , because he dropped obediently into the chair opposite mine at the breakfast table . I set the matchbox down between us . There was a pause . I opened it and poured the pills out onto the tabletop . <p> If Tommy had been really clever , he would have confessed everything right then . But he thought he could lie his way out of it . " Those are n't mine . " <p> " Then why were they in your bedside table ? " <p> " Oh , one of the guys was showing them off last week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a great show of casualness . <p> I sighed . " Tommy , do n't lie . " <p> " I 'm not ! " <p> " You are , damn it ! You should n't have the pills , and you should n't lie to me about it ! This is serious , Tommy - where did you get them and why ? " <p> He sat there , trying to remain poker-faced but blushing scarlet . Finally he said , " I found them . " <p> " You found them ? That 's the stupidest thing I 've ever heard ! Tommy , this can be a dangerous drug . You could seriously harm someone with it . Now for the last time , where did you get the pills ? " <p> Silence . <p> " All right , Tommy , that 's it . You 're grounded . No going out , no phone , no netting . When you 're at home I want you in your room unless it 's dinnertime . No skateboard team or drama after school . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . One by one I picked up the pills and put them back into the matchbox . <p> The first royalty check caught me by surprise . I had signed the patent agreement when I was working in Dave 's lab , but had n't really been paying attention . In academia you think about publications , not patents . But a check for eight hundred dollars is nothing to sneer at , so I put it into the bank and took Jonathan out for dinner to celebrate . The next month a bigger check came . And a bigger one the month after that . People were buying Efracol . At first I was puzzled ; I had n't thought there were so many women with sexual problems . <p> Evidently I was n't the only one puzzled . A Los Angeles Times reporter named Jennifer Bartholemew spent six weeks cruising the club scene on an expense account and wrote a series of articles called " The Seduction Pill . " She discovered that women were n't buying Efracol - men were . They were using it to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than I 'd ever expected . just about every church came out against Efracol , and so did the National Organization for Women , the Center for Science in the Public Interest , and Greenpeace . All the newspapers printed worried editorials , and Newsweek ran a cover story called " Is Science Out of Control ? The Efracol Controversy . " <p> For some reason , the reporters were n't all that interested in Dave Zhao or Will Wiener or the other men on the Wellaxo team . I was the one they all wanted to interview . The cheap irony that a woman had " invented " Efracol was impossible for the media to resist . <p> I managed to duck the television people , but there was one harrowing interview on Pacifica radio . It was a three-way discussion with me in the local radio station in Chapel Hill , pitted against a bioethics guru in Cambridge and a DEA agent in Washington . The Federal agent was fairly polite , but the ethics man kept referring to Efracol as a " mind control substance " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slaves . Afterward I wondered if maybe that was wishful thinking on his part . <p> The worst interview was with a girl writing for one of the local college papers . She obviously had n't read my original paper or the draft of the Scientific American piece that I 'd sent her by e-mail . The first hour of the interview consisted of my explaining things she should have already known . Then she threw the grenade . <p> " it all comes down to one question , Dr. Pickens : why ? " <p> " Why ? Why what ? " <p> " Why did you invent Efracol ? You must have realized how it could be used to harm women ? " <p> " I did n't invent it , I discovered a natural brain chemical which plays an important role in the sexual response of mammals . And I did it to improve our understanding of how the brain works . " <p> " Is that the only reason ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> Her voice dropped low , heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever used Efracol ? " <p> That was when I walked out - which was kind of awkward since it was my office . I had to ask the departmental secretary to get my briefcase and my computer . But how could I stay and admit that yes , I had tried it not long after the clinical trials , and that yes , it had made me desperately horny for a couple of hours ? Not exactly the white-coated image I like to project . When the story finally ran , it described me as " aloof " and " prickly , " and made much of the fact that I was still nursing Natasha at the time . <p> I did get a favorable column in Hustler . <p> Congress got the FDA to put Efracol on the list of Schedule II controlled substances , available only by prescription . Of course , Congress and the FDA could n't stop sleazy doctors from prescribing Efracol by the bushel basket to their male patients . Nor could they do anything about the string of clinics dispensing Efracol that sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or the brisk trade in pirate Efracol between Cuba and Miami . Or the dozens of Web sites telling how to make DBCA in your basement with common household chemicals ( only two of them were at all accurate ; most were simply wrong and at least one was horribly toxic ) . <p> There were reports of Efracol parties , with guests taking big fistfuls of Viagra and Efracol ( sometimes even both at once ) . A candy company made millions selling triangular chocolate candies with a green glaze . A mailorder company in Hillsborough came out with little foil packets containing a condom and an Efracol tablet . <p> In 2003 alone , Wellaxo sold more than a hundred million dollars , worth of Efracol , and one report claimed the unlicensed knockoffs produced in Russia , India , and Colombia made twice that amount . My share of the patent royalties amounted to ninety thousand dollars a year . <p> Duke offered me an assistant professorship , with a fat salary and a lab of my own . Being a famous scientist has its perks - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always welcome at any university . We bought a bigger house right near campus and Jonathan quit his newspaper job to start writing Civil War books . <p> With funding from my own pocket I could study whatever I chose . I dropped DBCA completely and began researching neurochemicals in fish and amphibians , delving into the chemical evolution of the brain . A nice , safe topic . <p> JONATHAN GOT BACK at six , smelling faintly of old paper . He had spent the day in the UNC library , reading crumbly letters written by Confederate soldiers . He was working on a book about free black soldiers in the Rebel army , and had been scouring every archive from Richmond to New Orleans for sources . <p> I met him at the door . " Jon , I found these in Tommy 's room . " I handed him the matchbox full of pills . <p> He opened it , studied them for a moment , then looked at me . " Is Tom home ? " <p> " He got back a couple of hours ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Hardly matters , anyway . We know he did n't get them from the doctor . Probably one of his friends . " <p> " I told him he was grounded until further notice . What are we going to do about this ? " <p> Jonathan sighed . " Oh , I do n't know . Confiscate them , I guess . " He started to head for our office but I stopped him . <p> " This is serious , Jonathan . It 's not some amusing little boyhood prank . What if he tries to give them to Megan ? " <p> " I do n't know if we should do anything . He 's sixteen , for God 's sake . You were n't a virgin at that age , and I sure did n't want to be . He 'll be careful . After all , he 's been hearing about using condoms all his life from school and TV , and I 'm sure Megan has , too . " <p> " That 's it ? That 's all you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condom ? Should n't we at least tell her parents ? " <p> He took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose . " Christ . What do you want me to do ? Act like some Puritan patriarch and tell him to stay chaste until marriage ? Or get Megan 's folks to put her in a convent , maybe ? This is the twenty-first century , Claudia . There are kids younger than Tom and Megan having children of their own . " <p> " It 's not him having sex that I 'm worried about . It 's the pills . Do you want your son using drugs to make some poor girl want to sleep with him ? " <p> " Some poor girl can make him want sex without pills ! " He chuckled but stopped when he saw I was n't laughing . " And why does she automatically become a ' poor girl ' anyway ? Is it such an ordeal , having sex with a man ? " <p> Jonathan and I had been married for nineteen years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much since he proposed . I did n't know what I expected his reaction to be , but it certainly was n't the one I got . " Using the pills to make her want sex is just as bad as forcing her . It 's like rape . " <p> " Then why is n't it rape for a woman to get a man aroused ? Come on , Claudia , you sound like some of those paranoid editorials . It 's a natural chemical , remember ? If a boy with an erection and a case of blue balls is supposed to know that ' no means no ' after two hours of necking , then a girl dosed with DBCA can refuse just as easily . " <p> " You really do n't see any difference ? So if Tasha goes to a party with Efracol in the punch and gets gang-raped , it 's all right with you ? " <p> That got him mad . He stomped off to the office and slammed the door , and did n't come out until dinnertime . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 . A girl in Los Angeles drank a lime daiquiri which her date had laced with an entire bottle of ground-up Efracol tablets . In large quantities , DBCA can cause seizures , paralysis , and heart arrhythmia . Within days of her death , the story was going around that she had been killed by the ultimate orgasm . Two cases of self-administered overdoses followed . <p> A student at Florida State University was raped by eight members of the DKE fraternity after being given three Efracols dissolved in a cup of punch . A high-school girl in Seattle died of internal bleeding after having sex with more than twelve boys in three hours at a party ; she had consumed nine Efracol tablets beforehand ( along with three hashish brownies , a nitrous-oxide cylinder , and five cups of bourbon ) . <p> On Long Island two men and a woman were found to be running a prostitution ring at a cheap motel , using Efracol to recruit girls . The woman invited local high-school girls to " dance parties " at the motel , where they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Male " guests " paid a hundred dollars each to attend the parties . <p> The student orientation packet at Duke began to include a little flyer called " Be Safe ! Know What You 're Drinking ! " It warned female students to avoid mixed drinks or any beverage served in cups . " Drink only from cans or bottles that you open yourself . NEVER let your drink stand open . " A friend on the faculty at Stanford sent me a similar brochure , which advised women students simply to avoid eating or drinking anything when men might be around . <p> It was my turn to make dinner , but I was too upset to cook , so I finally just ordered pizza . It was a very quiet meal . Tommy ate six slices with great efficiency , then excused himself and went back to his room . I could n't even taste what I was eating . Natasha kept up a running monologue about the rabbits in her classroom at school , and Jonathan listened with polite interest . After dinner Jonathan retreated into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Tasha did homework on her pad . <p> At nine-thirty I supervised her bath and preparations for bed . As we said goodnight I found myself wishing she could stay nine forever , innocent and happy , safe from little green pills . <p> Though it was not yet ten , I got undressed and went to bed . Jonathan was still sulking in the office . I lay there restlessly , refighting our argument in my head . After a few minutes I just could n't stand it any more . I got up , pulled on jeans and a shirt , got his keys off the dresser and went out . <p> I drove around for a little while , not really paying much attention to where I was going . I found myself on 15-501 , heading for Chapel Hill , so I followed the road into town and parked in one of the city garages on Rosemary Street . <p> I walked over to Franklin Street . Students from UNC and all the nearby colleges were everywhere , enjoying the warm spring night . The line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I really wanted , I decided , was a drink . <p> The bar down the street was n't as crowded as I had feared . To my chagrin the bouncer waved me in without even looking at my driver 's license . Inside the crowd was mostly seniors from UNC and Duke , with a scattering of grad students and some actual adults . <p> I ordered a Bloody Mary and got a seat at the bar , next to a couple of physics students arguing about warp drives . They ignored me as I sipped my drink and watched the room . <p> There were three young women at one of the high tables along the opposite wall , alternately scanning the crowd and bending heads together for a private conclave . Like most of the other women , they were drinking bottled beer . I noticed each girl kept a thumb over the opening of her bottle when she was n't drinking . <p> Two boys with unsuccessful beards stopped by to chat with them . Pleasant nods , dim smiles . The thumbs stayed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . The girls conferred and laughed . <p> About twenty minutes later one of them looked at the door and nudged her companions , then waved at a broad-shouldered young fellow with large dark eyes and perfect teeth . He came over to talk , and soon the girl who had waved was ignoring her two companions , practically hanging on his every word . <p> She took a sip of her beer and very deliberately set it down on the table , leaving it open and unprotected . A little while later she went off to the powder room with her two companions , leaving the bottle there . The boy did n't do anything to it , but when she came back the two of them went out together . The other two girls stayed behind . <p> FORTUNATELY for me , fame does n't last . Occasionally some reporter would give me a call when a spectacular sex crime made headlines , but a policy of refusing all interviews eventually got them to leave me alone . Not that I was ever a public figure . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autograph . <p> My e-mail folder still gets about ten messages a week from a hard core of fundamentalist Christians and radical feminists . I can spot them right away , as they usually have titles like " YOUR GOING TO HELL " or " 60million women raped eachyear by efracol " or the occasional " Efracol Kills ! " I forward the more threatening ones to Campus Security . So far , none of the writers has done anything but threaten . <p> At parties I talk only about my current research , although invariably some idiot will bring up Efracol and ask me about the latest spectacular sex crime . That 's one reason I do n't go to many parties . <p> And I still get a royalty check once a month . Sales of Efracol have leveled off in recent years - the number of legitimate users is fairly steady , and I do n't get any percentage of the illicit market . But it 's still worth about twenty thousand dollars a year to me . <p> On nights when the moonlight outside makes it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tainted money . Am I living in comfort because women are being abused ? Does Dave Zhao ever feel this way ? <p> Could I have suppressed it ? Maybe . For a while , anyway . But I did n't invent the DBCA molecule . It was there all along , in the brain of every mammal , just waiting to be isolated and described . <p> Maybe I should have looked into the chemical basis of guilt . <p> Jonathan was in bed when I got back , reading Smithsonian and clipping his toenails . He looked up at me but did n't say a word about my little excursion . <p> " I 'm sorry for what I said this afternoon , " I began . " We really do need to decide what to do about Tommy . " <p> " I told you what I think . Evidently it was n't enough for you . How much punishment do you think he needs ? Career opportunities for eunuchs are n't what they used to be . " <p> " Maybe some kind of counseling ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid - make him spend two hours a week in a room with some psych major trying to help him get in touch with his feelings . " He looked at my face and his smile faded . " Sorry . But I do n't think he needs counseling . I mean , he 's a sixteen-year-old boy . He 's desperate to have sex . Now offer him a magic pill that will make girls want to go to bed with him ; how can he refuse ? It 's what every teenage boy dreams of . When I was his age I would have sold my soul to the Devil for something like that . " <p> " But it 's not right ! " <p> " Why not ? " Jonathan was getting annoyed again . <p> " Because it is n't . The pills take away the girl 's free will . " <p> " No they do n't . No more than deep kissing and blowing in her ear do . Think of it as chemical foreplay . " <p> " It is n't the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the pills . It 's as bad as giving her tranquilizers and then raping her when she passes out . " <p> " You keep calling it rape ! Since when is it rape when the woman actively wants to have sex ? Was it rape that night after the blues festival ? Or in your aunt 's basement ? Or a thousand other times ? " <p> " But all those times I wanted you because I love you , not because you put something in my drink ! " <p> " Are you sure I did n't ? " <p> For a second I went cold all over . I felt as if I was about to throw up . My expression must have been really something , because Jonathan got up off the bed in a hurry and took me in his arms . " I 'm sorry , Claudia . God , I 'm sorry . I 'd never do that . I 'm so sorry , " he said over and over . <p> " I know " I said at last . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent for a long time , and when he spoke I realized he had been crying . " I get it now , " he said . " Tomorrow I 'll explain it to Tom . " <p> The next day Jonathan picked up Tommy after school and the two of them went off to Duke Forest together . When they got home with a bag of take-out barbecue for dinner Jonathan was determinedly cheerful and Tommy was very subdued . <p> Jonathan told me about it while we were getting ready for bed . " I talked a lot about trust and respect and how using the drug was a kind of betrayal . He did n't know what I was talking about . it turns out Megan was taking the pills herself ; he was n't slipping them into her drink or anything . " <p> " She knew ? " <p> " Apparently it 's no big deal for them . It 's just another chemical tool in the toolbox . Caffeine to stay awake , steroids to bulk up , beer to get silly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disk into a computer . " <p> " I 'm not sure I like that any better . " <p> " Me neither - it 's a bit of a shock to hear my wildest teenage fantasy described as no big deal . But I guess it makes sense ; Tom and Megan are part of the first generation to grow up with Efracol . It 's a whole new world . " <p> " More like a Brave New World . " <p> " Maybe . I do n't know . I read him the riot act about obeying the law and being honest . I do n't think that will be a problem ; Tom 's smart about following the rules . " He sighed . " He was so practical about it all . I feel old and bewildered . " <p> I cradled his head on my chest . " Would you have tried to slip me Efracol when we were going out ? " <p> " Yes , " he said without hesitation . " Do you hate me for it ? " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have done anything . My brain was steeped in DBCA the moment I met you . " <p> " Scientists are such sweet talkers . " He rolled over and gave a sigh . " So in thirty years are Tom and whoever going to be popping Efracol when they want a quickie ? Or will this go the way of nose bangles ? " <p> " I do n't know . " It felt good not to know . I no longer felt responsible . For better or worse , the world could handle Efracol without my help . " Good night .
