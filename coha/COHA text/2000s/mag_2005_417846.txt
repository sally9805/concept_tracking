Master of Disguise Over time , animals have developed many ways to stay away from predators . A predator is an animal that hunts and eats other animals . Hiding is one of the best ways to stay alive . Some animals hide by looking like the places where they live . To see how this works , let 's look at the leafy sea dragon . You may never have heard of this sea creature , but it is a master of disguise . The sea dragon is covered with skin that looks like leaves . The skin helps the dragon look like a piece of seaweed . A hungry meat-eater would stay away from anything that looks like seaweed . Leaf-like skin is just one part of the sea dragon 's disguise . Its fins make another part . They are small . They slowly push the dragon through the water . So the dragon looks like it 's floating-just like seaweed . The sea dragon 's mouth completes its disguise . The mouth looks like just another seaweed stem . There are even small " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tube that works like a straw . That mouth is great for slurping up the dragon 's favorite food-sea lice . Yum ! Show-offs ! The leafy sea dragon hides to stay safe . Other animals stay safe by showing their colors . They want other animals to see them . Scientists call these bright colors warning colors . The colors tell predators to stay away . You have probably seen animals that have warning colors . Think , for instance , of all those insects that buzz by you on warm days . When one flies by , you likely swat it away . But what happens when a yellow bug flies in your face ? Do you swat it ? Or do you jump away ? You guessed it . Yellow is a warning color . It tells you that the pesky pest might be a bumblebee or a yellow wasp . You do n't want to bug those insects . Some grasshoppers show off their own bright colors . A few are even red and blue . Those colors do n't just look spiffy . They tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes ignore the warning . They still go after the grasshopper . If that happens , the grasshopper has a backup defense . It makes lots of foam . The foam tastes so bad that the predator wo n't do it again . Blending In Many animals use colors to match the place they live in . This is called camouflage . Some even change colors with the seasons . The snowshoe hare has rusty brown fur in summer . It blends in with the colors of fields . In fall , the hare loses its brown fur . It grows thick white fur . The new fur matches the snow in winter . It also keeps the hare warm . On the Ball Color does n't offer enough protection for some other animals . They have different defenses that help them survive in the wild . The armadillo needs all the defenses it can get . It is only about two feet long and weighs 15 pounds . It has small teeth . So it can not even bite to protect itself . Instead the armadillo has an armored shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armor protects this animal from bumps and bruises . The armor also makes it much harder for a predator to eat an armadillo . An armadillo does not just rely on its armor , though . It has a couple of other tricks . When an armadillo spots a predator , it first tries to run away . A scared armadillo darts for the safety of its burrow . A burrow is an underground home . But that 's just the beginning . If an armored armadillo can not get away , it hides in its shell . First it tucks in its legs and ears . Then it rolls its shell together . It turns itself into a living ball . It 's an animal roll-up . Most hungry hunters do n't know how to eat an armadillo roll-up . They can prod and poke . They can toss the roll-up around . But they can not find a tasty bite to eat . Lying Lizard Like the armadillo , the frilled lizard tries to run away when it spots a predator . It darts up a tree . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . But that does n't always work . Sometimes the lizard ca n't just run away . When that happens , it tries to bluff its way out of becoming a tasty treat . It pretends to be bigger than it really is . It also acts tough . The lizard opens its mouth as wide as it can . The skin around its neck pops out like an umbrella . It hisses and whips its long tail around . This makes the lizard look bigger and scarier than usual . These moves often work . They scare some predators away . Other hungry hunters may not be scared exactly . Yet they go looking for other snacks . Few animals want to mess with this crazy critter . Either way , the lizard wins . It lives to eat its own supper of delicious insects and spiders . School Safety Many fish live in groups , or schools . That 's because there is safety in numbers . At the first sign of trouble , schooling fish swim as close together as they can get . Then the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it hard for predators to make a meal out of just one fish . Many other animals also stay safe by moving in groups . Predators can not see individuals in a large group . Common Defenses These are only a few of the ways that animals escape predators . They have other defenses too . Just look around . Cats arch their backs to look big and scary . Green grasshoppers blend into grass . Claws and teeth help animals fight . These adaptations , or useful traits , are quite different . Yet they share one purpose . They all keep an animal from landing on the menu . Sidebar <p>
