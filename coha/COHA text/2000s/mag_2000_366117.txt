When I spoke to Boris Yeltsin by phone on New Year 's Eve , shortly after he announced his resignation , he conveyed a mixture of relief that a tough choice was behind him and confidence that it was the right choice for his country . <P> The manner of his leaving the presidency was vintage Yeltsin  --  bold , blunt , even defiant , but rooted in his core belief in the right and the ability of the Russian people to choose their own leaders and their own course for the future . <P> I met him for the first time in June 1992 , when I was still a candidate for the presidency and he was fairly new in his own job . Since then , in the 19 times we 've met , I have often heard him speak , with unmistakable and sometimes pugnacious pride , about his greatest achievements and , with equally straightforward candor , about where he still had work to do to build a genuinely democratic , prosperous and modern Russia , pursuing its national interests while cooperating with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday he took obvious delight in scoffing at predictions ( " lies , " he called them ) that he would never give up power voluntarily . His critics and rivals wanted to cast him as an autocrat . But the single idea I heard Boris Yeltsin utter more than any other was that his country must never go back to a dictatorship of any kind , especially to the communist system he so clearly detested . His enduring commitment to democracy was evident in his resignation statement , when he said that Russia 's recent parliamentary elections , which brought forward a " new generation of politicians , " had persuaded him that he had finished " the main job of my life . " <P> Now Yeltsin 's designated successor , Vladimir Putin , must be the custodian of Russia 's democracy while running for its presidency in March . If Russia is successful in passing power from its first democratically elected President to its second , then the country 's direction will be in the hands of a new elected President and Duma , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Multiple parties vie for power through the ballot box . There are some 65,000 nongovernmental organizations and approximately 900,000 private businesses where there were none a decade ago . A pluralist political system and civil society , competing in the world markets and plugged into the Internet , have emerged from a totalitarian monolith that was closed off from the outside world and implacably hostile to our values and interests . <P> No one deserves a larger share of the credit for this transformation than Yeltsin himself . For all his difficulties , he has been brave , visionary and forthright , and he has earned the right to be called the Father of Russian Democracy . <P> In saying farewell , Yeltsin was characteristically frank about what has n't gone right under his leadership . He asked " forgiveness " for hopes that have n't been realized . " What we thought would be easy turned out to be painfully difficult , " he said , acknowledging that along with new opportunities for some , the past decade has brought deep hardship for others .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
