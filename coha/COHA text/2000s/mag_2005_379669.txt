For the past two years , scientists , public-health officials and even a high-ranking government official or two have warned about the potential danger of a deadly worldwide outbreak , or pandemic , of avian flu . But it took a couple of furies named Katrina and Rita to really bring home how much can go wrong if you do n't plan for major emergencies . <P> Suddenly old warnings about flu , which had seemed so remote , were sounding a lot scarier . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared in September , once again , that as far as an influenza pandemic is concerned , the question is not if but when , not whether millions would die but how many millions . President George W. Bush talked last week for the first time about how he , as Commander in Chief , might respond to an epidemic , raising the possibility of using troops to enforce quarantines . He also recommended that folks read John Barry 's book on the 1918 pandemic that killed more than 50 million people worldwide and that serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world could face ( see ESSAY ) . A reconstruction of the 1918 virus , reported in scientific journals last week , shows it to be an avian strain that mutated just enough to infect humans directly and easily . <P> The prospect of a flu epidemic makes us wobbly . We bounce back and forth between being scared silly and just plain apathetic . Influenza regularly kills 1 million people a year  --  36,000 of them in the U.S.  --  yet most of us do n't get vaccinated . The new threat requires a different response  --  a healthy respect for the toll that even a moderate pandemic may take on our society and just enough genuine fear to figure out some smart steps to take to minimize the damage . " We need to scare people into their wits , not out of them , " says Michael Osterholm , director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota . With that in mind , here 's a primer on the risks of a flu epidemic and the government 's preparations for countering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BECOME A FLU THAT KILLS PEOPLE ? <P> All influenza viruses  --  if you trace their lineage back far enough  --  got their start in birds , and the great majority stay there . But a handful of flu viruses adapt to the point that they can infect people . Each year the viruses capable of invading human cells mutate slightly in a way that leads to fresh outbreaks , but most people will still have a partial immunity because of previous exposure to similar viruses . Occasionally , though , a strain that had seemed to infect only birds will cross over more or less intact into humans . Because this new strain is so different from garden-variety flu viruses , few people are immune . That is apparently what happened in 1918 and in Hong Kong in 1997 , then later in Vietnam and Thailand and in Indonesia this summer and fall . <P> Virologists named the newest strain of avian flu H5N1 , after two proteins ( hemagglutinin and neuraminidase ) that dot the surface of the virus like spikes on a mace . Since 2003 , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention of health authorities , and at least 60 of them have died . So far , the vast majority have been infected through close contact with birds ; human-to-human infection is still extremely rare . What gives health authorities nightmares is the possibility that the lethal H5N1 could mutate into a virus that is easily passed among humans .
