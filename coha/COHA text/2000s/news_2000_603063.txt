<p> KLAGENFURT , Austria  --  After a tumultuous week for Joerg Haider , the leader of Austria 's far-right Freedom Party and the man accused of being the new century 's version of Adolf Hitler , this day 's very ordinariness seemed extraordinary . It was a day of local photo ops and small- town musicians . There were no rowdy protesters dogging his steps , no diplomatic dust-ups in which to star . <p> As Europe grapples with right-wing extremism in a major capital for the first time since the Nazi era , white-hot international controversy has been Haider 's constant companion . Now , Joerg Haider ( yorg HY-dur ) is making some tactical adjustments to defuse the contretemps over his party 's role in Austria 's new government . Even some of his critics say the world overreacted to Haider 's anti-immigrant party obtaining power . <p> " He 's a right ( wing ) populist . It 's an exaggeration to call him a fascist , and he 's definitely not a Nazi , " says Peter Gerlich , a University of Vienna professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy has been simmering since elections Oct. 3 , when the Freedom Party finished a stunning second with 27% of the vote , its best mark ever . For months thereafter , the traditional power brokers in the conservative People 's Party and left-leaning Social Democrats struggled unsuccessfully to form a government . <p> People 's Party head Wolfgang Schuessel , intent on leading a government as chancellor , invited Haider to share power . That decision loosed an international outcry as Austria 's neighbors feared the goose step would replace the Viennese waltz . <p> The European Union ( EU ) downgraded relations with Austria . Israel recalled its ambassador , saying it would conduct no official business with a government it suspects of having Nazi sympathies . The United States recalled its top diplomat for consultations , though Ambassador Kathryn Walt Hall said Wednesday she would return to Vienna late this week for a two-week stay . <p> Why such a fuss over a provincial politician in a country of 8 million people ? The fear certainly is n't that Austria will reprise the Third Reich ; the landlocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The real worry is that Haider 's seductive appeal will be contagious and spread hate across a continent that was confident it had eradicated fascism . Most European countries have their own far-right or neo-Nazi groups to worry about . In Germany , the DVU has won seats in state parliaments . In France , the National Front gets about 10% support in polls . <p> But none of them has a leader like Haider . To his critics , the smooth-talking governor of Carinthia province , who will not serve in the national government , represents retooled fascism . This is no spittle-spewing , tub-thumping hater . Haider is a natural politician , a polished , telegenic performer who makes Austria 's traditional leaders look and sound like staid 19th century leftovers . He runs marathons , including New York City 's , in 3 1/2 hours . Haider is a stylish dresser  --  the brown shirts in his closet are Armani . <p> " Haider is not Hitler . ... He 's really good . He 's a pop star , " says Walter Famler , publisher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its Sound of Music scenery and rich cultural heritage , might seem an unlikely place to trouble Europe 's conscience . The home of Mozart and Freud , this normally tranquil Alpine nation combines low unemployment with a generous Old World social safety net . Unemployment is a mere 4.2% , less than that in neighboring Germany or France . Workers are eligible for retirement at age 57 . The taxis are spotless Mercedeses . <p> Austrians would n't appear to have many reasons to complain , let alone hate . But Haider 's emergence is the product of both internal and external forces . On the domestic front , after decades of the same political elite governing the country in an old-boys-club arrangement , Austrians thirsted for change . They found it in the Freedom Party . " After elections , we always had the same people in government , " Gerlich says . " I have no sympathy for his policies  --  they are very damaging to Austria  --  but he was the only alternative for many people . " <p> In more fluid systems , demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Haider seems to recognize that the success of his " refreshing new movement " ca n't be cloned by extremists elsewhere . " You can understand the success of the Freedom Party only by ( reference to ) the specific Austrian political situation . No other country had such a rigid division of power between two parties for so long a time . " <p> Austria 's geography also has aided Haider 's rise . Smack on the East-West divide , Vienna was a capital of intrigue and espionage during the Cold War . After the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , the porous borders to the East bloc left Austria vulnerable to a surge of refugees fleeing a near-decade of Balkans warfare . Almost 90,000 came here from the carnage in Bosnia in the 1990s . <p> About three-quarters stayed , unlike the anti-Communist Hungarians who came temporarily after a 1956 anti-Soviet uprising . By 1992 , more than one-third of Austrians were telling pollsters that they feared being overrun by foreigners . <p> Today , fewer than 10% of the country 's inhabitants are non-Austrian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria 's neighbors is fanning popular fears . " We are a small country in the middle of Europe . We ca n't accept refugees from all over the world , " Haider says . " There are nearly 1 million foreigners here . That 's enough . " He voices common concerns when he says EU expansion could open Austria to torrents of Slovenes , Slovaks , Hungarians and Czechs willing to work for far less pay than Austrians . <p> Haider 's prominence is sending tremors through IntegrationHaus , a refugee aid center in Vienna . The center , which provides housing and counseling while refugees wait to learn whether they can stay , gets about half its annual $ 1 million budget from the Austrian and Viennese governments . Lydie Krob , a center official , fears the new rightist government will cut off the cash . <p> Abdul Rahim , an Iranian political refugee , lives in the warehouse-style building with his wife and four children . He doubts Haider will be any worse than his predecessors . " My asylum case is 3 years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long it will take . This is not the problem of Haider . ... This is a problem of ( Austria ) , " he says . <p> Riding the anti-immigrant wave has taken Haider and his party to power . Now , they 'll have to govern amid a looming fiscal crunch that makes higher taxes and reduced services all but inevitable . " Every time he 's been in a position of power and responsibility , he 's shot himself in the foot , " says Hans Rauscher , one of Austria 's top political columnists . " He ca n't keep his mouth shut . " Those opposing Europe 's hottest political star are betting on it . <p> Joerg Haider 's career <p> 1970 : Joerg Haider enters the Freedom Party while a university student . <p> 1979-1983 : Haider serves as member of parliament for the Freedom Party . <p> 1986 : Haider elected head of the Freedom Party . <p> 1989 : Haider elected as governor of Carinthia province , a post he said he would use as a springboard to the chancellorship . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment , " Haider is forced to resign as governor .
