I close my eyes and imagine the touch of my mother 's hand on my forehead , smoothing away the residue of childhood nightmares . Her finger moves across my forehead , tracing letters and words of prayer that I never understood , never wanted to understand , her mouth whispering in nearly silent accompaniment . Now , waking from the nightmare that has become routine  --  bathed in sweat , breathing hard , resigned to the sleeplessness that will follow  --  I remember her soothing touch and appreciate it with an intensity that I never felt when she was alive . <p> I shake my head to dispel the longing . The world has changed around us , and , because of all that has happened , I know it is my time to give comfort and not to receive it  --  not that I have yet proven equal to the task . Shoving myself out of bed , I make the quiet nightly journey across the hall . I pause in the doorway of my sister 's childhood room . Her daughter , Sakina , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each even breath , curled up in the corner of Ameena 's old bed , apparently at ease with the night and its quiet in a way I have not been for a very long time . <p> Every night , I have the same nightmare . <p> I search through a crowd of people on an endless expanse of green lawn , pushing past bow-tied waiters in white uniforms who carry trays piled high with biscuits , sandwiches , and tea . There are tables draped in white linen , chairs occupied by aunties and uncles . Beyond the garden , there is a pavilion trimmed in teak , furnished with cane-backed chairs where the pale , white ghosts of British officers and their wives , the founders of this place , whose names are still etched on plaques at the front entrance , congregate to laugh at the antics of the natives , swirling their gin and scotch , clinking their glasses . <p> My search is urgent , every moment that passes means loss . And death . I know I am dreaming . But the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time , then everything will be all right . As I approach the edge of the crowd , I see what I did not see before  --  that the endlessness is merely an illusion . There are high walls surrounding the lawn . From beyond them , I hear a roar of sound , which drowns out the clinking of glasses , the laughter and chatter of the people around me . Over the walls , which seem to be shrinking , getting lower so that what is outside is starting to become visible , I see crowds of angry people , clouds of dust and debris that hover over a city of ruins . In the distance , I see twin plumes of smoke rising up out of the chaos . <p> I turn away from the fearsome sight and see her . She stands alone , at the other edge of the crowd . A path clears . I run . Before I can reach her , I am distracted by voices behind me , calling my name . I stop and turn to see whose they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another old woman , my grandmother , who shakes her head sadly . An old man dressed like Gandhi , battered and bruised , throws his shoulders back and shouts something I can not hear , raising his fist in protest . There is another white woman , different from those officers ' wives in the pavilion , dancing by herself to a tune I can not hear , her arms encircling an imaginary partner . These are all familiar characters from stories I know , stories I have lived my life by . <p> I turn my back on all of them because Ameena is still there , alone , at the edge of the crowd . She is wearing red , the color she wore at her wedding , her head draped by the long dupatta of her outfit . I begin to run when I see her , shouting a warning she does not hear . From somewhere behind me , a gun is shot . Ameena falls to the ground , the red of her blood darkening the red of her clothing . I scream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside me . A child . She was with me all the time , running through the crowd , trying to save her mother . I turn to face her and see her arms outstretched . I lift my own to meet hers and find I am holding something in my hand . She sees it , too , and recoils . I look down and understand why . I was wrong . The shot did not come from behind me . It came from the gun in my hand . <p> There are no secrets here  --  I know exactly what the dream means . It is what I should do that I can not resolve . I approach the bed and stare down at Sakina for a moment . Her face is hidden , turned away from mine . Her arms are wrapped tightly around a little doll that used to be Ameena 's . I wrap mine around myself and marvel at how easily she has staked her claim . On Ameena 's room . On Ameena 's toys . I remember battles fought with my sister in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which always ended with a story from our mother . But that was long ago  --  in the days when I was young enough to want whatever Ameena had . In the days before I began to roll my eyes at our mother 's stories . As I turn to leave the room , my eyes fall on a jewelry box on the dresser . And the memory of one of those battles is so clear that I can feel Ameena 's arms around me , now , as her daughter sleeps in the room where the skirmish took place . <p> Ameena 's grip around me was so tight that I had to struggle to free one hand . But I did , reaching up immediately to grab a clump of hair and pull for all I was worth . She shrieked , but not as loudly as the howling I had commenced upon losing hold of Ameena 's jewelry box , which she had found me playing with in her room . Her hair was her Achilles ' heel , long and straight , easy to grab and hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was jealous of it . My own , my mother kept boyishly short  --  because I was a wild creature , she said , and it was too much trouble for her to try and keep it tame . <p> <br> Continues ...
