Chapter One Kayla Simone Johnson My life is a complicated one . I used to go out a lot , meet a lot of people , but now I do n't feel like meeting anyone . My ginger brown complexion , long brown hair , and nice shape definitely turn heads . But I do n't care about heads turning anymore , because I 'm content with life . I used to think I needed a man , but now I know better . Actually , now I see I do n't need one at all . I wish other women would realize that , too ! Getting on talk shows arguing over men who lie and cheat and writing books about men . Who needs a man anyway ? I do n't . I met a man who proved it to me . Here is my story . First , I 'll tell you all about the boah , Emar . I met him one cold , rainy Wednesday morning as I was walking across Temple University 's campus . I know the exact time , 11:40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced myself to attend . Once I arrived at the class , I was told my professor would not be in . Damn . I had gotten up for nothing . I was mad as hell . I ca n't believe I 'm only a sophomore and still have two more years of this shit . It was one of those days when you just wanted to stay under the covers . That day , the sun must have gone on vacation and a nasty gray sky was subbing for it . It had to be about twenty-sevendegrees outside , with freezing rain . I had on a gray sweat suit with a white tee hanging out and my Nike jogging sneakers . I was wearing my big coat , but the cold air was still going through my layers . Besides my coat , the only thing that somewhat protected me was my umbrella . In no way did I feel attractive . I knew everybody else was feeling the exact same way-except for this one girl who was coordinated to the tee . Now , how some women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down raining , I will never understand . She was carrying a green , navy , and maroon plaid umbrella and wearing a navy beret that was tilted to the side with her hair peeking out . She also had on a navy wool pea coat with a maroon scarf wrapped around her neck that set it off just right . I was impressed . Here it was , I almost could n't wake up and sis was looking like she was about to pose for Vogue magazine . All she needed was a poodle to walk and she would have been picture-perfect . Well , back to my story . It was cold and I was heading back to my small dorm room at Hardwick Hall when out of nowhere this guy came and got under my umbrella . I gave him a look like , " What the fuck ? " He smiled , and all I saw was his perfect gleaming white teeth , slanted eyes , and oak brown skin . He was about 6-feet 4-inches tall , with jet black hair . He also had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip . " What 's up , sis , can I get under here with you ? " he asked with a huge smile . I did n't say yes or no . He did n't give me a chance . All I knew was somehow he had steered me around and I was now walking in the opposite direction of my dorm . " Where we going ? I do n't know you . Getting all under my umbrella like that . I never saw you on campus . You could be a killer . " I jerked my arm away from his grip . Who the hell did he think he was , anyway ? He was cute , but he was n't all that . " My bad . I 'm not no killer . I do n't bite and you never saw me ' cause I 'm always on the road . You do n't know me ? You like basketball ? " " Yeah , I like basketball . Just not college ball . Why ? " I said , shrugging . " Why not college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the guys who are playing . It 's just a bunch of nobodies running up and down the court . " " I guess I 'm one of those nobodies . I 'm Emar Gerson and I play point guard for the Owls , " he said , shaking his head as if he could n't believe I did n't know who he was . " Really , " I said , embarrassed . " Yes , really . " " Where you got me walking to anyway ? " I asked , trying to change the subject . " I do n't know . You want to get some coffee or something ? " he asked as he glanced at his watch . " I do n't drink coffee , but maybe I can get a tea or something . " So I walked with this cute stranger to the coffeehouse , which was in the middle of the campus student activity center . It was seemed as if everyone was speaking to Emar , who just nodded his head up like , " What 's up ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him because he was a senior and had been at Temple four years , plus he was a star basketball player . Watching him , I was so intrigued with his coolness that I almost bumped into some airhead freshman girls who were just all in the way . " Hey , E , " they said , giggling . He did n't respond . As a matter of fact , he acted as if he did n't know them . He kept me from colliding into the blushing girls by nudging me slightly out of the way . Emar ordered my tea and his coffee and found a table for us . I grabbed us some sugar and poured pack after pack into my hot , steaming tea . Then I leaned forward and inhaled the vapor of this man who stood before me . It was a long , deep breath . Whooph . Emar was the mar , short for marvelous-or was it just that I could marvel all day ? He told me he was an athlete , actor , and poet and about to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be in the second round , ' cause he had hurt his leg his sophomore year and needed to prove himself . The scouts had been saying he got it but he was n't cut out for the NBA . But Emar was sure somebody was going to grip him up . Plus , his coach had put the word out and a couple of teams had been inquiring about him . All he had to do now was prove himself . I took another sip of my tea as my thoughts raced from today to tomorrow with Emar Gerson . I imagined myself being Emar 's girl , being Mrs. Gerson and the perfect life we would live together . I could see myself watching from the sideline of one of E 's games . Probably in Chicago somewhere , cheering him on . I would be a basketballer 's wife . I would travel with my husband all over the country . Or maybe I would just stay home , go shopping , and do rich things , like take my Pekinese dog to the hair salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would get massaged , manicured , pedicured , facialed , and pampered all day . I would have a personal cook and a fitness trainer available twenty-four hours a day to get me into shape after I gave birth to Emar Jr . To keep myself busy , I would find a favorite charity to dedicate myself to . And I would hire an interior decorator just to decorate my car . Yeah , I would be rich and have nothing better to do than to spend E 's money from his 56.9-million-dollar Nike contract . When I start thinking E 's been acting up , I 'll go over to Mrs. Jordan 's house for marital tips . I 'll ask her how her marriage survived . And she 'll confide in me because I 'll remind her so much of herself when she was younger . She 'll tell me what to do to keep Emar in check , and even share some of her favorite recipes with me . We 'd even call each other every now and then just to keep in touch . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be together . It was fate . How else would you explain my not even wanting to go to class , getting up anyway and throwing on my old gray sweat suit only to meet him in the middle of a rainstorm ? Anyway , it was still pouring down rain outside and the coffeehouse was becoming crowded . The manager asked us to leave . We had already stayed past the time allowed , which was two hours , and he needed our table . We tried to keep ordering food so we could stay , but I was full from cookies , tea , and a turkey sandwich . Emar had three coffees and a bagel . We had to face it : It was time to go . I did n't want to leave Emar . He was so interesting . I mean , the only thing I said in those two hours was an occasional " Really ? " He told me so many basketball stories-how he actually met Michael Jordan at a basketball camp and played with Kobe Bryant in a summer league . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't wait to play against him again . " Where to now ? " I asked Emar as I gathered my things . " To my room . Can you hang ? " he asked as he picked up his book bag and turned toward the door . I could n't say no to my dream of happily ever after , could I ? I had to seize the opportunity . " Yeah , I can hang , " I replied , trying to sound unimpressed . I knew exactly what he was talking about . He wanted some of me and I wanted a piece of him . He licked his plump , juicy , bubble-gum-colored lips as he led me out of the coffeehouse and across campus to his dorm room . His roommate , Rodney , was there . With his short , fat body , light skin , and curly hair , he looked like a bad imitation Heavy D. But I did n't have to look at him long . He scattered in a matter of minutes , leaving Emar and me alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't . He took his time . He sat down on his black-and-white striped sheets , then grabbed a pillow and put it behind his head and leaned against the wall . Then he turned the television on with his remote . When Emar noticed I was still standing by the door , he patted the space next to him and said , " Come have a seat . You do n't have to be scared . " Once I sat down next to him on the bed , he started playing in my hair . Then he asked me if I wanted to watch a movie . " Sure , what do you have ? " I asked . He jumped off the bed and pulled a box out of the closet that was full of VHS tapes . He joked and asked me if I wanted to watch a porno . " Ill no , boy . " I said in disgust . " Psyche , " he said , grinning . We watched a comedy , then a gangster flick . Do n't ask me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was getting dark and the lights were out . I could feel Emar 's hands going up and down my back . His touch sent waves of exciting energy into my system . I knew I should n't have sex with a guy on the first date . Damn , it was n't even a date . We had just met about five hours ago when it was so cold and now it was so unbearably hot where I was lying . But ... but ... there was no excuse . Fuck it . I gave him some . Fifteen minutes later , after the intensity and fire was over , I wanted him to hold me , snuggle with me , and cuddle me . But Emar did the exact opposite . He went from burning hot to ice cold in a matter of minutes . He leaped up from the bed and said he had some running around to do and needed to take a shower . I smiled and said " OK . " I knew what time it was . He might as well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence on TV . Yeah , I could catch a hint . Mr. Emar Gerson was throwing me out . When he was in the shower , I wrote my number down and left it on his dresser next to his watch . Nah , I was n't going to act pressed , like what had just happened meant something when it did n't . It was just another blow to take on the chin , and not a very powerful one at that . I should have been blocking myself , keeping my guard up . Instead , I had let my opponent into my zone and he hit me . It was my own fault . You ca n't be doing crazy stuff like meeting a man and having passionate sex with him when you do n't know him . If he wanted me , he would have to call me . I threw on my coat and left . On my way home , I began to feel like a slut . Bad thoughts started racing through my head . What if he do n't call me-or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and disrespects me ? He could start going around telling everybody he " had me " like some nutty guys do . Emar could be a nut . That would ruin everything . There were plenty of guys on campus who had been trying to get with me for the last two years . They would feel some type of way to know all it took was some smooth talk , a little tea , and a bunch of basketball stories to part these legs . By now , I was walking so fast , I was almost jogging . I was sweating . My heart was pounding and tears were streaming down my face . I wiped my tears away as I noticed people getting off the bus coming home from work . It was only 6:30 in the evening , but all I wanted to do was go home and get in my bed . But it was taking forever to get there . It had gotten colder-at least it felt that way . Finally , I reached my building , where I flashed my school ID at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Damn . Who was there but my roommate Tuesday with her **52;958;TOOLONG serf , and her boyfriend , Sherman , with his reformed nerdy wannabe-bodybuilder serf . There they were , cuddling in front of the television , watching a rerun of " Married with Children . " Damn . I could n't even cry in peace . They were the last people I needed to see . They were just so happy , so perfect , so fucking sickening . All that lovey-dovey bullshit depressed the hell out of me . I must have had get out written all over my face , because suddenly Tuesday jumped up and said in her always happy tone , " Kayla , we were about to get something from the Chinese joint . Want us to get you something ? " " No , " I responded sadly , dropping my book bag on our pine desk . " OK , see you later then , " Tuesday said as they left . After I heard the door slam , I thought about how I wished I could tell Tuesday about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , she would just look at me with judgmental eyes and give her typical goody-two-shoes opinion . No thank-you . She was so good . I was so bad . She had good grades and a good man . I wished I had a Sherm , a nice considerate man . Well , I almost did . When we first started school , I met Sherm first . But I thought he was a corny young boah . He used to meet me after classes and help me do my laundry . He was nice , but I did n't like him romantically . So I dissed him . I thought he was a nut . He was too damn nice . But Tuesday saw something in him . She worked with him and molded him . Shit ! How was I supposed to know he was going to turn into such a good man ? I know I will never have what they have . Never ever . Good things like that do n't happen to me . I thought about calling Yaz . She would understand . Yazmine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship for the most part . I mean , her boyfriend do be doing his thing , but they 're happy . I could ask her for some advice . Nah , I did n't feel like talking to her either . I did n't feel like talking to anyone . Sleep is more understanding . It does n't ask any questions or criticize . So I dozed off around 7:30 P.M. The rain tapping on my window woke me up . I got up out of the bed and looked at the alarm clock . It was 3 A.M. I could n't believe I had been asleep for so long . Tuesday had n't come home . She must have stayed with Sherman . I walked to the bathroom and then crawled back in the bed . But this time , I had a hard time falling asleep . I kept thinking about Emar Gerson and how I had played myself . Continues ...
