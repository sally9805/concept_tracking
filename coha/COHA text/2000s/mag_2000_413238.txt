" WILL I END up in a wheelchair ? " It 's the first question manyi people ask when told they have MS . The use of any type of mobility device is often viewed as the hallmark of disability , the ultimate sign of defeat . Viewed from a different perspective , however , canes , walkers , motorized scooters , or wheelchairs help people live active lives . They promote independence , conserve energy , and generally make life easier . TIME TO REFOCUS Before people can begin to see mobility devices this way , they first need time to deal with their frustration and loss . When waling becomes difficult , people need to grieve . It 's normal to feel sad and angry about a limitation that alters one 's life . Changes of this kind force people to develop a different picture of themselves , and changing self-image is never easy . It requires letting go of the old self and gradually redesigning a new one that can incorporate the limitations . Grieving is a natural part of this , and will ebb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process also involves tackling some difficult questions : Who am I now that I can no longer do things the way I used to ? What are my goals now ? What will they be in the future ? What changes do I need to make ? What are my options ? This is a crossroad where a new set of choices needs to be made . It 's not surprising to feel overwhelmed , and I would urge people who feel this way to talk it over with a doctor or a counselor . The National MS Society can refer callers to counselors who are familiar with these issues . I have some questions that may help people who are stopped at this crossroad . EXHAUSTED OR ENERGIZED ? The most common symptom of MS is fatigue . At one time or another , virtually everyone will experience a tiredness that interferes with daily activities . People who have to concentrate on each step they take may find themselves too tired to focus on the world around them . The effort to get from one place to another can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place . But many people with MS resist using mobility aids for fear that they will become dependent on them . Sometimes wellmeaning family members or friends insist : " You can still walk-you do n't need a mobility aid yet . " In reality , energy is one of our most valuable resources , and people with MS can use mobility aids to protect this precious commodity . Devices can get them where they want to go with enough energy to be productive-and have funonce they get there . Many people ( including some health-care professionals ) are concerned that using mobility aids is " habit forming " ; they think once a person sits down , she or he may never get up again . This is a distorted view of the reality of MS fatigue . People with MS definitely need exercise , preferably a regime they design with a physician or physical therapist . Using up precious energy struggling to walk can be a poor choice . GIVING IN OR TAKING CHARGE ? Using a mobility device is " giving in to MS " many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would crown MS the winner . I would recommend reframing the image . Try to think of MS as a series of battles to be fought rather than a big war to be won . We have no cure as yet , but we do have a variety of ways to reduce battles to minor skirmishes . Mobility devices can become tools for winning , not giving in . A cane or a rolling walker , for example , can prevent falls and show others that the problem is medicalnot substance abuse . A scooter can make shopping trips manageable , and visits to a museum or zoo a pleasure instead of a trial . A person might use a cane or nothing at all on the best days , and go with a walker when feeling more fatigued . A wheelchair or scooter may even make a new sport possible or reopen the door to an old favorite . People in scooters bowl , fish , and play golf . Others use wheelchairs for tennis or basketball . DEPENDENT OR INDEPENDENT ? People with MS often say that using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer they resist , the more independent they feel . In reality , mobility devices allow people to go where they want without having to rely on others . They can keep pace with everyone else , " walk " side-by-side , and share laughter and conversation . Family members , friends , and co-workers ultimately benefit too . They no longer find themselves worrying about the person with MS getting hurt in a fall or becoming too tired to stand . EMBARRASSED OR EMPOWERED ? Many people struggle to walk unassisted so others wo n't stare , feel sorry for them , or think less of them . They may accept a cane , but resist a walker or crutches . And some will stay at home rather than be seen in a scooter or wheelchair . In other words , they dread being stigmatized or labeled . It 's worth remembering that mobility devices often help people look less disabled . A person struggling to walk may look like a drunk . A person using a cane looks purposeful , and may even give off an aura of confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with others and arrives looking ( and feeling ) in control . People who use aids do sometimes have the experience of being treated as though they 're invisible . This example is all too common : A man in a wheelchair and his wife go into a restaurant to have dinner . The server turns to the wife and asks what her husband would like to have . In this uncomfortable situation it 's important to remember that the server is probably not being intentionally unkind or insensitive . Most people have little understanding of disability , and simply do not know what is and is not appropriate . To handle this , the wife might say , " I do n't really know what he would like , but I 'm sure he 'll be happy to tell you . " Or , the husband might respond , " I 'll be happy to give you my order . " In other words , people often need to be shown how to respond . Consider the young woman in a scooter waiting at a street corner for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her was about to make some pitying or derogatory comment , she sped across the street . The man caught up to her and said , " Can you please tell me where you got your scooter ? It looks great . Something like that could really help my wife . " Author Affiliation <p>
