1 <br> Word to Life <p> I am not who you think I am . If you love me , you love me for the wrong reasons . <p> Females tell me they love me because I 'm tall . They love when I stand over them and look down . They love when I lay them down and my height and body weight dominates them . <p> Females tell me they love me because I 'm pure black . They say they never seen a black man so masculine , so pretty , so beautiful before . <p> Females say they love my eyes . They 're jet black too . Women claim they find a passion in them so forceful that they 'll do anything I say . <p> Females tell me they love my body . They beg me for a hug even when there 's nothing between me and them . They want to be captured in my embrace , and press their breasts against my chest . <p> Some females ask if they can just touch me . Some tremble when my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arms . They surrender when I lift them up . They whine and moan in rapture . Some cry their pleasure . Some shake . Some pee . <p> Some of ' em even say they love the way my teeth look in my mouth and how my feet look in my kicks . <p> Females tell me they love the way I walk , like I 'm soon to own the world . <p> Most females say they love that I 'm quiet . Then shiver when I finally talk . <p> All of the women show me that they love my guns , the fact that I walk with two of them at times . Even the ones who get scared fall in love with their fear of me . Then they come at me even harder . <p> Some females say I 'm too serious , then shield their eyes to hide their feelings from the shine when I finally smile . <p> I ca n't lie , I enjoy the good times that some of these women offer me . But I do n't take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know me . All the shit that they are in love with is just my style and my looks , all window dressing . <p> I know that a man is his own beliefs , his own ideas and actions . If you knew me , you would know what I believe . If you knew what I believe , then you would understand how I think . You would understand my ideas and actions . Only then should you decide . Either you believe what I believe , or you admire what I believe and want to get with those beliefs . If not , in the long run , we got nothing in common . I ca n't take you seriously . I got ta go . You got nothing that makes me want to stay . <p> I do n't come from where you come from . I do n't think like you do . My whole situation is different . I come from a country of real men who take real life , real serious . <p> I would n't trade places with an American-born man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , a son has a first name and three last names . The three last names are the names of his father , grandfather , and great-grandfather . Any male who can not identify his father , grandfather , and great-grandfather is already lost . <p> These three names are what makes a boy who he is . There is no talk of role models and celebrities . A son is raised under his father 's wing , with a grandfather to guide and a great-grandfather as a blueprint , plus an army of uncles nearby . <p> Where I 'm from , a man does not bow to any other man . A man bows down only to Allah . Only Allah created the heavens , the galaxies , the universe , and all of the millions of creatures within . <p> My father had three wives . Not one wife , one wifey , and a bunch of random bitches on the side . <p> Where I am from , a man wants to marry a woman and establish a strong family . A man can have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fairly and provide them with love , separate homes , food , guidance , and presence . <p> There is no such thing as domestic drama . A woman feels fortunate to be selected by a quality husband , a family man , who will be by her side for her entire lifetime . Families are permanent . <p> When a man is ready to build his family , he selects a woman who he likes , who is from a family who raised her right , a woman who knows how to love and live . She has to be good for him , his beliefs , and plans for life . Someone who brings him peace , progress , and pleasure . Then he is down for her for real . <p> She is down for him too because she feels his strength , craves his love and attention , feels safe tucked at his side , and is confident that every day he is making the right moves for her , his family , and himself . <p> Our women do n't argue with their man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do . It is the same thing he watched his own father do and not do . So he does it . Even if a man selects the wrong path , his punishment is between himself and Allah . His woman can not punish him , judge him , or nag him to death . <p> In my country , a wife is not a whore or ex-whore . Every move a woman makes matters . She can bring dishonor to her man and family even with a simple glance at another man , if it is held for too long . <p> Even where I am from , there are whores . They know their place too . They stay within the walls of the illegal whorehouse , never to be glorified , honored , claimed , or married . A whore , where I am from , is the opposite of arrogant . She is used but never celebrated by decent men or women . She knows that she can never enjoy the lifestyle and contentment of a respected sister , daughter , mother , or wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good family and suddenly behaves whorish is severe . She will be isolated by her parents , family , and friends . Her father and mother may lock her away and confine her to one room in the house . In some cases , she is even murdered by her own husband , father , or brother for bringing shame and dishonor to her family and the people who raised , guided , loved , and provided for her . <p> The family member who commits the murder is not arrested . The whole country acknowledges that a woman is sacred . Every move she makes is either building her family up or breaking it down . Every thought she has is felt and considered by her children . Every word she speaks either teaches or misleads . She must remain honorable , pure , and righteous , otherwise there will be no happiness , no family , and no reason to exist . <p> Mouthing off ; fucking her man 's friends , brothers , and cousins ; running away with the children ; aborting the babies ; lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing who the father is ; yelling and disrespecting ; doing drugs ; drinking ; parading around mostly naked ; acting crazy ; our men do n't stand for that . We have not experienced that . We never will . <p> Our women know their place . They stay in it and live and thrive there . They remain there happily . Our women give love and are loved even more . She is respected , protected , and provided for . She lives proud and at peace . <p> Where I am from , liquor is illegal and forbidden . We believe that it makes a man behave with ignorance . After drinking liquor , the next step , we believe , is to disgrace God , and destroy yourself and your family . <p> In my country , homosexuality is nonexistent . For the absolute majority it is unknown and undone . There have been one or two of those who have traveled out to other places in Europe or America and come back with this bizarre behavior . However , they could never remain with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up missing . <p> There are no tears for the man who enters into the exit , and builds a life where there can be no balance , reproduction , or family . <p> Where I am from , adultery is a crime for a man or a woman . Even to fuck someone else 's sister or daughter just because you feel like it or like the way she looks , without approaching her family for marriage , means that you have brought about a battle between dishonored families , yours and hers . The man who commits adultery will be punished by his family . The woman who commits adultery will be considered ruined . <br> <p> Where I am from , men work . Whether he works his own land and is paid in the foods the Earth produces ; whether he works someone else 's land ; whether he is paid in cash , cattle , or otherwise ; he works . Hard work is a man 's way of providing for and demonstrating that he loves his family . <p> Each man must have a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meats , vegetables , fruits , jewelry , clothing , crafts , furniture , vehicles , parts and supplies , or other items . Or he may provide services as a doctor , carpenter , construction worker , engineer , lawyer , driver , educator , or performer . But no man can sit doing nothing . His family , backed up by the entire community , would never allow it . <p> When I talk about where I am from , which is almost never , both males and females feel uneasy . Some look at me in disbelief , like I 'm a fucking liar . Others stare off in complete boredom , like it is not a life they would ever want to live . But I feel fine . People where I am from are happy , while almost everybody I know in America feels fucked up , empty , and dissatisfied , especially the Black people . <p> At fourteen years young , I became a citizen of the United States . It was supposed to be a great day , to be remembered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what is known as the best country in the world , America , after having been born and living inside of what Americans consider the worse place in the world , the continent of Africa . <p> We got dressed up and took the A train to City Hall in New York City . We recited some things that we had already memorized . Then it became official . <p> I should say it became legal . I was an American on paper . I never became one in my heart or mind . <p> The year I became an American was the same year I got locked up . I went from the projects , to juvenile detention , to prison . Each year I became more and more familiar with the American Blacks . The ones who look just like me . They range from very light skin to my rich dark color , as it is back home . When I first arrived , they were Afro-Americans , then Blacks , then African Americans , and eventually niggas . <p> They talked like they were the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on other Blacks arriving from any other country in the world . They hated every accent besides their own . They was quick to catch an attitude and say some shit that I could tell they really knew nothing about . <p> There was no real way for me to separate myself from them . We all looked the same , wore the same clothes , spoke the same slang . All united by our Air Jordan kicks . <p> I do n't talk a lot . Where I 'm from , the boys and men are trained to leave the blabbering to young girls . <p> It was n't too long before I realized that if I said nothing for the rest of my life , shit would only get worse . I 'm telling my story so Black people worldwide will know that we was n't always fucked up . Also , that a good life takes great effort and sacrifice , but feels so much better than what we all got now . Besides , if the authentic men do n't say shit , there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living side by side with niggas , and watching them play themselvesevery second of every day , the broke ones all the way up to the rich ones , is killing me . <p> I 'm not a preacher , politician , pimp , or celebrity . Most of them could n't go to hell quick enough for me . A man who does n't say what he means or do what he says , craves attention and misuses it when he gets it , does n't share what he knows and earns , deserves death . <p> I am not who you think I am . My people are not who you think they are . Our culture and traditions are unknown to you . Sometimes it takes someone from the outside to show you how you look and do . If you 're American born and raised , you 're bound to get it twisted . You ca n't see yourselves or do n't know yourselves . You 're too accustomed to looking at life from only one fucked-up angle . <br> <p> Everything you have ever seen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that the storyteller is the most powerful person in the world after God . My grandfather said be careful who you listen to and what they are saying . The storyteller is clever and masterful and has already decided exactly what he wants you to think and believe . <p> The storyteller has the power to make people feel good or bad about themselves . The storyteller has the power to make people feel strong or weak , ugly or beautiful , confident or defeated . <p> Unfortunately , all of the stories being told to Blacks in America , Europe , Africa , and the Caribbean have made Blacks worldwide feel low , weak , crazy , backward , and powerless . So low that the storyteller has set the conditions for Blacks to be robbed of all of their stuff and too stupid to recognize it . <p> So put your brews and blunts on pause .
