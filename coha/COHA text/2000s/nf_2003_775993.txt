Politics and the Creative Imagination // For some time I have been puzzling over the sources of the creative imagination . I began close to home with an effort some years ago to probe the creative imagination among historians , but I have tried to go beyond that , to uncover some general clues to the sources of those mysterious impulses that propel the mind beyond familiar ground into unexpected territories-that account for the sudden appearance of creative configurations of thought , expression , vision , or sound . // At times the creative imagination seems to work in isolation , when an individual , impelled by some uninstructed spark of originality , glimpses relationships or possibilities never seen before , or devises forms of expression never heard before . But most often the creative imagination does not flare in isolation . Creative minds stimulate each other , interaction and competition have a generative effect , sparks fly from disagreement and rivalry , and entire groups become creative . We know something about how that has happened-how such creative groups have formed-in art , in science , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe , has happened in politics , though in ways we do not commonly perceive . I do not mean sudden turns in legislation or public policy . I mean the recasting of the world of power , the re-formation of the structure of public authority , of the accepted forms of governance , obedience , and resistance , in practice as well as in theory . // The creative reorganization of the world of power and all its implications has happened at various points in history , but rarely , if ever , I believe , as quickly , as successfully , and-so it seems to me-as mysteriously as by a single generation on the eastern shores of North America two hundred years ago . // The Founders of the American nation were one of the most creative groups in modern history . Some among them , especially in recent years , have been condemned for their failures and weaknesses-for their racism , sexism , compromises , and violations of principle . And indeed moral judgments are as necessary in assessing the lives of these people as of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from the outcome of their efforts , which they could only hopefully imagine , and ignore their main concern : which was the possibility , indeed the probability , that their creative enterprise-not to recast the social order but to transform the political system-would fail : would collapse into chaos or autocracy . Again and again they were warned of the folly of defying the received traditions , the sheer unlikelihood that they , obscure people on the outer borderlands of European civilization , knew better than the established authorities that ruled them ; that they could successfully create something freer , ultimately more enduring than what was then known in the centers of metropolitan life . // Since we inherit and build on their achievements , we now know what the established world of the eighteenth century flatly denied but which they broke through convention to propose-that absolute power need not be indivisible but can be shared among states within a state and among branches of government , and that the sharing of power and the balancing of forces can create not anarchy but freedom . // We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal , written constitutions , upheld by judicial bodies , can effectively constrain the tyrannies of both executive force and populist majorities . // We know , because they had the imagination to perceive it , that there is a sense , mysterious as it may be , in which human rights can be seen to exist independent of privileges , gifts , and donations of the powerful , and that these rights can somehow be defined and protected by the force of law . // We casually assume , because they were somehow able to imagine , that the exercise of power is no natural birthright but must be a gift of those who are subject to it . // And we know , what Jefferson so imaginatively perceived and brilliantly expressed , that religion-religion of any kind-in the hands of power can be the worst kind of tyranny-that , as he wrote in his most eloquent state paper , // to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on the supposition of their ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magistrate being , of course , judge of that tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment . . . Truth Jefferson concluded in his Act for Establishing Religious Freedom is great and will prevail if left to herself . . . she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error , and has nothing to fear from the conflict unless , by human interposition , disarmed of her natural weapons , free argument and debate-errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them . // These were extraordinary flights of creative imagination-political heresies at the time , utopian fantasies-and their authors and sponsors knew that their efforts to realize these aspirations had no certain outcomes . Nothing was assured ; the future was unpredictable . Everywhere there were turns and twists that had not been expected . Though they searched the histories they knew , consulted the learned authorities of the day , and reviewed the masterworks of political theory , they found few precedents to follow , no models to imitate . They struggled with logical , ideological , and conceptual problems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more difficult the problems appeared . // So they were asked : How could constitutions that were to restrict the exercise of power effectively dominate the agencies that had created them ? // Were individual rights to be protected against the state ? Who could define them ? // Conscience was declared to be free . But was not religion , and specifically Christianity , the ultimate source of morality and probity and hence of justice and fairness ? So should Christianity not be enforced as a matter of state policy ? // There was no end to the problems , and there was never any certainty in the outcome . Some of the problems in the course of time would be solved , some persist to this day and will never be fully resolved . But what strikes one most forcefully in surveying the struggles and achievements of that distant generation is less what they failed to do than what they did do , and the problems that they did in fact solve . One comes away from encounters with that generation , not with a sense of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations of their own world-but with a sense of how alive with creative imaginings they were ; how bold they were in transcending the world they had been born into . // How did that happen ? What accounts for their creative imagination ? What conditions made it possible ? // I do not know the answers to those questions . But surveying that lost , remote world , one comes repeatedly on a distinctive element that seems to have played a significant role . It does not account for individual genius , for the sheer power of intellection or for the inspired capacity to reconfigure familiar elements into new patterns and structures . These are the ultimate qualities of the creative imagination . Yet there are circumstances , underlying conditions , that have an empowering force on latent capacities that otherwise would remain inert . // In a brief but brilliant essay entitled " Provincialism , " the art critic Kenneth Clark commented on the differences between metropolitan and provincial art . Through the centuries , he wrote , metropolitan art , emerging from dominant centers of culture , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , creating standards and forming assumptions that only idiots , Clark wrote , would challenge . But in time metropolitan art , for all its successes-and in part because of them-becomes repetitive , overrefined , academic , self-absorbed as it elaborates , polishes , and attenuates its initial accomplishments . A kind of scholasticism sets in , while out on the margins , removed from the metropolitan centers , provincial art develops free of those excesses . Artists on the periphery introduce simplicity and common sense to a style that has become too embellished , too sophisticated , too self-centered . The provincials are concrete in their visualization , committed to the ordinary facts of life as they know them rather than to an established style that has taken on a life of its own . And they have a visionary intensity , which at times attains a lyrical quality , as they celebrate the world around them and strive to realize their fresh ambitions . // There are dangers in the provincial arts , Clark points out : insularity ; regression into primitivism ; complacence in the comforting familiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the vigor of fresh energies ; they are immersed in and stimulated by the ordinary reality around them ; and they transcend their limited environments by the sheer intensity of their vision , which becomes , at the height of their powers , prophetic . // Thus Kenneth Clark on provincialism in art . To a remarkable degree I believe the same might be said of provincialism in politics and the political imagination-particularly the politics of Revolutionary America . // The American founders were provincials-living on the outer borderlands of an Atlantic civilization whose heartlands were the metropolitan centers of England , France , the Netherlands , and Spain . The world they were born into was so deeply provincial , so derivative in its culture , that it is difficult for us now to imagine it as it really was-difficult for us to reorient our minds to that small , remote world . We can not avoid reading back our powerful cosmopolitan present , the sense we have of our global authority and our expanded social consciences-reading back all of that into that small , unsure , preindustrial borderland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics in eighteenth-century America was metropolitan , transcultural , European if not universal ; but the reality of the Americans ' lives , the political and social context in North America , was parochial , and the provincialism of those borderland people had , I believe , in political thought precisely those creative qualities that Clark describes in provincial art . // How provincial were they ? There is literary evidence , some of it eloquent . William Byrd II , returning to Virginia in 1726 after ten years of intense striving in England 's literary and political circles , called his native land a " silent country , " in which at times he felt he was " being buried alive . " Though surrounded by " my flocks and // my herds , " he wrote back to England , " my bond-men and bond-women , and every soart of trade amongst my own servants , " he was lonely . There was no one to respond to his wit , his satire ; no one to acknowledge his intellectual achievements , no way to establish his worth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . He was no longer in the world . Nostalgically , he kept his rooms in London , practiced his languages-every day some Greek and Latin and a bit of Hebrew-read diligently , remorselessly , in several European languages , built up his library into a formidable collection of over three thousand titles , and continued to write , for his own satisfaction , while pouring out to his diary his longings for a greater world . // There were other isolated bookmen and old-fashioned virtuosi-the learned Pennsylvania Quaker James Logan , for example , more successful and consequential a scholar and scientist than Byrd-who were similarly remote from the metropolitan culture , similarly dependent on echoes from abroad . And later , in the pre-Revolutionary years , there would be an outpouring of belles lettres in the North American towns and cities-a plethora of literary efforts and polite discourses in coffeehouses , clubs , salons , and tea tables , all " aping metropolitan rites and fashions , " all aspiring to images of a greater beau monde , all refracting metropolitan styles in amusement , wit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London physician down on his luck , emigrated to Charleston , South Carolina , rose through his professional skills and his reputation as what he called " a great wit and a great Scholard , " a veritable " vir literatus , " to achieve , in that center of provincial culture , wealth , position , and status , while pumping his English correspondents for word of literary developments in London , inquiring after his old acquaintances and literary idols , and // hoping that his friends , in their " walks thro ' Moorfields and the Stalls . . . would pick me up some pamphlets and 2 or 3 penniworth of Learning good and old . " He would consider that " a singular favour , " // For Fortune plac 'd me in a ruder soil , // Far from the Joys that with my Soul agree , // From wit , from Learning-far , oh far from thee ! // Later , in 1763 , Benjamin Franklin , back in urban and enterprising Philadelphia after years in England , knew better than anyone else how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he had launched his Junto 's program of cultural development . But he wondered why it was that the " petty island " from which he had just returned-a mere stepping-stone in a brook next to America , " scarce enough of it above water to keep one 's shoes dry " - should have , in almost every neighborhood , more sensible , virtuous , and elegant minds than could be collected in " 100 leagues of our vast forests . " The most gifted Americans , he wrote , merely " lisp attempts at painting , poetry , and musick. " // But the witness of art and architecture is more objective and more revealing . // The young John Adams spoke with envy of the rich and powerful in his world , of a smug , arrogant American aristocracy , of elegant American mansions , of grand estates and grand prospects . But what was the scale ? How grand was grand ? // Some of the grand places he and his contemporaries knew are familiar to us-they have survived or been rebuilt-though we do not often think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
