<p> During the past two years , Lutheran North head baseball coach Matt Neidigk has had a total of five seniors on his team . <p> But Neidigk is not about to give up . <p> ' We have a lot of great kids . The future looks really good for us . ' <p> " It is a rebuilding process , but we have been competitive , " Neidigk said . " They take five teams to the playoffs out of our district ( TAPPS District 4-4A ) . We still hope to be one of them . " <p> The Lions , who advanced to the regional final two years ago , were 7-8 overall and 0-4 in league after the first 15 games of the season . That is solid improvement over the 5-21 record from 2002 , when the Lions had just three seniors on the team . <p> " We have made some strides this year , " Neidigk said . " We have a lot of great kids . The future looks really good for us . " <p> Lutheran North 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grable . Brand , who is batting .330 and plays third base when not on the mound , is being recruited by Mary Hardin-Baylor . <p> " He also could go play soccer , too , " Neidigk said . " He is an excellent soccer player , too . " <p> Sophomore shortstop Brandon Guzman leads with the team with a .350 batting average and 18 RBIs . Junior catcher Raymond Luna is hitting .300 with 17 RBIs . <p> " Raymond has been our team leader all season , " Neidigk said . " I am glad we have him back for another year . That is going to be a big positive for us . " <p> Sophomore pitcher Randy Wakefield has posted three victories . <p> " Randy is probably our No. 1 starter right now , " Neidigk said . " He is young but he is very talented . " <p> Neidigk said Houston Christian , Second Baptist and Fort Bend Baptist are the leading teams in TAPPS District 4-4A . <p> " They pretty much have the top three spots locked up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logjam between Lutheran South , John Cooper , us and Westbury Christian . We have two big games with Cooper ( coming up ) . That might determine our postseason fate . " <p> Lutheran North plays six games in the final two weeks of the season . <p> " We have been competitive , but we have n't got over the hump , " Neidigk said . " We lost 1-0 to Kinkaid ( in a non-district game ) . We had a chance in the bottom of the sixth and the bottom of the seventh , we just did n't come up with the timely hit . <p> " That kind of has been the story for us lately , " he added . " We have to come up with the clutch hit and the clutch defensive plays if we want to make the playoffs . " <p> Lutheran North has defeated St. John 's 9-8 and placed second in the Northland Christian tournament . <p> " We lost to Northland Christian 4-3 in the finals ( of the Northland Christian tournament ) , " Neidigk said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that is kind of how our season has gone . We have got to pick it up a little over the final two weeks of the season . " <p> <p> St. Thomas track <p> Aaron Cottrell did n't feel the need to change much when he took over as head track and field coach at St. Thomas . <p> Cottrell plans to follow the lead of his predecessor , Santiago Santos , who led the Eagles to their first Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools Class 5A track championship . <p> " We 've got pretty much the same kids , and the coaching staff is intact , " Cottrell said . " We have a great shot at repeating , if we stay healthy and everyone performs up to their capabilities . " <p> St. Thomas has done well in early-season competition . The Eagles finished sixth or better in every meet , with the exception of the Highlander Invitational at The Woodlands . <p> They won a tri-meet with Bellaire and St. John 's , placed third at the St. John 's Rebel Relays and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've had some quality results , but we have n't hit our stride , " said Cottrell , whose team will try to defend its title at the TAPPS District 3-5A meet at home on April 23 . That 's the final meet before the TAPPS State Championships May 2-3 at Baylor University in Waco . <p> Senior Cyd Robinson has probably been the most improved athlete on the squad . Robinson , who ran on several relays at state in 2002 , was clocked in 49.5 seconds in the 400 meters during the recent TSU Relays . <p> " Cyd 's time is already two seconds faster than the winning time at state last year , " Cottrell said . " He 's a kid who has continued to get stronger and faster . We 're expecting big things from him . " <p> Robinson also vies in the 200 and could medal at state in that race , in addition to competing in the long jump . <p> But the biggest threat at state is senior Gavin Fleming , who can earn medals in no less than four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's meet . He was third in the 110 hurdles ( 15.74 ) , third in the high jump ( 6 feet ) , fourth in the long jump ( 20-9 ) and fourth in the pole vault ( 13-6 ) . <p> Already , Fleming has gotten better in every event . He 's lowered his time in the 110 hurdles ( 14.7 ) , cleared 6-5 in the high jump , gone 21-6 in the long jump and soared 14-3 in the pole vault . <p> " Gavin could be the high-point man at state , " Cottrell said . " He could be top three in every event and win the pole vault . " <p> St. Thomas also will lean heavily on senior Geoff Bennett , another multi-event standout . Bennett was a state champion last year in the 110 hurdles ( 14.99 ) and triple jump ( 44-4 1/2 ) and was a silver medalist in the 300 hurdles ( 40.93 ) . <p> The only thing that could hold Bennett back is a nagging injury . <p> " Geoff has a stress fracture at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Hopefully , he 'll be at 100 percent for district and state . " <p> Cottrell said Bennett will need to be on top of his form this spring . <p> " From what I understand , hurdles probably will be the toughest races at state , " Cottrell said . " El Paso Cathedral has a great kid , and there are several other fast ones in TAPPS . " <p> Senior Billy Kana is another veteran from last year 's state championship group . Kana was a bronze medalist in the 300 hurdles ( 41.24 ) and also finaled in the 110 hurdles . <p> " Billy won the St. John 's meet ( in the 300 hurdles ) , " Cottrell said . " He 's been impressive so far . " <p> Senior Aaron Damian also is a St. Thomas athlete who could score . Damian was third in the 100 ( 11.65 ) and seventh in the 200 ( 24.06 ) at state in 2002 . <p> " Aaron 's one of our best sprinters and an important part of our relays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record-setting quarterback in football , is another quality athlete . But Locke , who was second in the pole vault ( 14-0 ) last year , wo n't be available for a few weeks . He is traveling in Europe as a member of the under-19 U.S. national rugby team . <p> " Andrew will miss a month or so , but he 's such a great athlete , I 'm not worried , " Cottrell said . <p> Junior Michael Rozelle has gone 13-6 in the pole vault and should uphold St. Thomas ' tradition in that event . The Eagles managed a 1-2-4 finish last year en route to the title . <p> " I have to give a lot of credit to my assistant coach , " said Cottrell of Nathan Labus , a former University of Houston star who coaches St. Thomas vaulters . " He gets those kids ready every year . " <p> While the pole vault is perhaps St. Thomas ' best event , the Eagles do have three relays that can hold their own with anyone in TAPPS . <p> St. Thomas won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kana , Damien , Bennett and Robinson has already run a 44.28 . <p> The 4x200 relay of Fleming , Robinson , Damian and Kana turned in a 1:32.2 at the Strake Jesuit Relays and could make it on the awards podium in Waco . <p> The 4x400 relay of Locke , junior Michael Pena , Fleming and Robinson also could make it a sweep . <p> Other individuals who could deliver a few points at district and perhaps state are sophomore sprinter-jumper Elegy Etter , junior Jay Ambosy and senior Jack Shallock in the distance events and senior half-miler David Lynn . <p> " We 're not as powerful in the distance races , but we 're well-stocked in the sprints , relays and field events , " Cottrell said . " This is a senior team that is going to do some damage . "
