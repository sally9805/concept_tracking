Last week 's conviction of the founders of The Pirate Bay did not shut down the filesharing website . Instead , it has boosted the ranks of its supporters and raised awareness of an ideological and legal battle for control of how the Internet is used . <p> The court ruling handed down one-year jail sentences to each of the four men and assessed $3.6 million in criminal damages . The global entertainment giants that brought the case , including Warner Bros. , Fox Movies , Sony Music , and EMI , claimed it as a major victory . <p> But even as the founders were being sentenced , 10 million Internet users were busy downloading music and movies via their website . And the verdict has been appealed , meaning that the website may remain unaffected for years - and become a standard-bearer for those who argue for a free flow of media and information over the Internet , unfettered by state and corporate control . <p> " There is a growing social movement around this issue in Sweden . It goes beyond filesharing and downloading free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and Internet analyst at Stockholm 's Royal Institute of Technology . " It includes people who are concerned about surveillance laws and who feel the Internet is being developed by governments and corporations instead of the common man . <p> " The Pirate Bay , " he adds , " has a lot of sympathy right now . " <p> Within three days of the ruling , the Pirate Party - which campaigns for copyright reform - gained more than 15,000 new members , doubling in size to become the country 's fourth-largest political party . Several Internet service providers ( ISPs ) , including Telia Sonera , the country 's largest , said they would not block The Pirate Bay website and would no longer keep records of any sites visited using their networks , thereby protecting their customers from potential lawsuits . <p> Why Sweden ? <p> Sweden developed a reputation as a haven for online piracy after it invested in high-speed broadband in the late 1990s and its reluctance to tackle filesharing became clear . The presence of The Pirate Bay , one of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures titled " How To Dismantle A Multibillion Dollar Industry As A Hobby " - made the accusation hard to deny . <p> Until recently , politicians and police chiefs did little to enforce Internet copyright laws , says Jan Rosen , chairman of the Swedish Copyright Association . <p> " There was a laissez-faire attitude and the main political parties have been very reluctant to take a stance , " he says . <p> That stance may be related to the tradition of openness in the country , he says . " The Internet has been seen as a media that is open and free . Politicians were reluctant to challenge that view . But eventually , criticism from overseas became too embarrassing and the government began to act more forcefully . " <p> Pressure from the global recording industry , as well as the US and Hollywood , led to police raids in 2006 . The Pirate Bay 's servers were seized , yet the site was back in business within days , using other servers located in the Netherlands . The ensuing publicity doubled the number of users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 3 million registered members . <p> Ruling being appealed and resisted <p> Last week 's ruling was intended to send a strong signal , says Peter Danowsky , the lawyer representing the recording industry association , IFPI , in a case that sought nearly $14 million in compensation for lost revenue to artists . " The Pirate Bay is one of the most devastating operations from a rights-holder 's perspective , not just because of the number of users but also because they are so clearly building and creating public opinion in favor of filesharing , " he said . <p> Mr. Danowsky believes the verdict will help turn the tide of public opinion . <p> " Until now , many disputed whether the website was illegal . Some compared it to a car manufacturer , which can not be held responsible if drivers do n't follow traffic rules , " he said . <p> The Internet providers refusal to block the website from their networks is tantamount to " siding with the Pirates , " argues Danowsky , adding that recording studios may consider further lawsuits to force them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending , it is unclear whether they can succeed . <p> Still , downloaders are facing at least a few more constraints . <p> Sweden 's Internet battles opened on a wider front earlier this month when a tough new law came into force obliging ISPs to reveal the identities of customers suspected of uploading or downloading illegal content . <p> The day after the law came into force , Internet traffic dropped by a third , and in the months preceding it , tens of thousands began signing up for anonymizing services that hide computers on the Internet . The ISPs recent decision to stop saving Internet traffic data is a response that will no doubt please many customers . <p> ' A fight for the control of knowledge and culture <p> Critics of new Internet legislation reaching statute books across Europe - Ireland recently introduced a " three strikes and you 're out " law , banning repeated copyright offenders from the Internet , and France is debating a similar approach - claim that the measures pose a growing threat to personal integrity and will hamper development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloading copyrighted material , you need to control the Internet and sift through all communications , " says Rick Falkvinge , leader of The Pirate Party , who refers to the verdict as his party 's " ticket to the European Parliament " in next June 's elections . <p> " The establishment and politicians have declared war against a whole generation , " he says . " This is a fight for the control of knowledge and culture . " <p> Magnus Eriksson , a spokesman for the Swedish file sharing lobby group Pirate Bureau , a driving force behind The Pirate Bay , echoes that sentiment . " The freedom of the Internet is threatened now in a very real way , " he says . " The danger is that the Internet will be turned into just a marketplace for copyright industries and the whole cultural and economic dynamic will be lost . <p> " Verdicts like this can scare people off developing new Internet networks and services because , if they contain links to copyrighted files , the owners could wind up in court . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says that selling copies of music and movies is outdated in a digital age , and that the future of the entertainment industry lies in selling access over the Internet . He cites the example of bands such as Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails , which have successfully cut out the middle man and sold their music directly to fans . <p> Stricter law enforcement may even accelerate moves to new models . <p> " More people are getting scared of downloading illegally now , and they are signing up for paying online services , " he says . " We 're at the start of a major format shift that will probably last 10 years . New legal services are coming online all the time , and verdicts like this will increase pressure on the industry to start working with them and making content available .
