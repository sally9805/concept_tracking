In this season 's postelection pulse taking , morality re-emerged as a top voter concern . But it has been a consistent theme for the Rev. Billy Graham , 86 , preacher to millions over six decades and counselor to 10 Presidents . TIME 's Sonja Steptoe caught up with him as he embarked on what will probably be his final round of crusades , beginning last weekend at the Rose Bowl . <P> YOU 'RE SUFFERING FROM PARKINSON 'S , AND YOU HAD TWO SERIOUS FALLS EARLIER THIS YEAR . HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW ? <P> One fall broke my left hip , and I had to have a new hip put in . In the second fall , I broke my pelvic bone in three places . The only way at my age to get healing of the pelvic bone is to stay in bed , so I 've had to stay in bed most of this year . I feel a little weak from that , but I feel fine otherwise . <P> WILL YOU RETIRE FROM PREACHING AFTER THE JUNE EVENT IN NEW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , in every stadium , so it will be like going home again . I do n't think I can go on forever . I do n't know of any clergy who has held meetings in big stadiums like this at my age . John Wesley may have come close , but he spoke to smaller groups in churches . <P> YOU 'RE KNOWN AS THE MINISTER TO PRESIDENTS . WHAT 'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO PRESIDENT BUSH ? <P> I 've known him for many years . We 've taken summer vacations with him at Kennebunkport in Maine . We love the Bush family , especially his father and mother . I consider his father one of my closest friends . <P> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE EXIT-POLL RESULTS SHOWING THAT ONE-FIFTH OF VOTERS LISTED MORAL VALUES AS THEIR TOP CONCERN ? I sense that people are searching for purpose and meaning in their lives . Many feel lonely and are out of touch with the culture . <P> DO YOU THINK GOD , FAITH AND RELIGIOUS VALUES SHOULD HAVE A MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN PUBLIC LIFE ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 200 years has indicated that this is a nation under God . It 's reflected in various ways , such as the words of the Pledge of Allegiance and the presence of Bibles in public places like hotels . <P> DO YOU APPROVE OF GAY MARRIAGE ? <P> I believe marriage is between a man and woman . <P> WHAT ABOUT PLACING THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS ? <P> So many people today are breaking the Commandments , they need to be reminded of them . I would like to see them displayed in many places . If you go to the Supreme Court or to many of the public buildings in Washington , you see them on plaques . It indicates that historically we have attempted to present to the American people the basic moral-law foundations , which I think are contained in the Ten Commandments . <P> BEYOND POLITICS , ARE THERE ISSUES SUCH AS POVERTY , FAMINE OR THE AIDS CRISIS THAT YOU 'D LIKE TO SEE CHRISTIANS EMBRACE NOW ? <P> As an Evangelist , I try to address how the Bible speaks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those issues and more in my upcoming crusade sermons . The big issue is sin . From the very beginning , man rebelled against God in the Garden of Eden and that has been inherited by the entire human race . It 's a problem all over the world and in our own hearts . That 's why the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the answer to sin , because when he died on the Cross , he took the sins of the world upon him .
