Chapter One Herman Strockmire Jr. , attorney at law , got his fourth severe ventricular arrhythmia at 7:45 Tuesday morning while riding up to his borrowed office on the thirtieth floor of the Century City high-rise . It was the day before he was scheduled to appear in federal court to argue his case to protect the monarch butterfly . He was in the plush-pile elevator , rocketing upwards at blast-off speeds , his ears popping every ten floors , his short , bulging body feeling as if it were pulling at least two Gs . His heart arrhythmias always started with the same curious sensation : first a mild loss of energy , followed by a sinking feeling as if a hundred extra pounds had just been strapped onto his five-foot-eight-inch , lunchbox-shaped frame . This heavy sluggishness was immediately accompanied by a sensation of light-headedness that quickly left him-short of breath , dizzy , and slightly woozy . Fifty-five-year-old Herman did n't have to take his pulse to know that the old ticker had just gone into severe arterial flutter . He did n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faded briefcase down , grabbed his fat , furry left wrist , and wrapped his stubby fingers around it , finding his pulse . " Jesus , " he muttered into the elevator Muzak . " It 's doing a damn fandango . " He did n't want to count beats ; did n't have to , really . He knew from past episodes that it was up over 150 , maybe as high as 185 . I do n't need this now , he thought . On the thirtieth floor the elevator doors hissed open revealing the art deco foyer of Lipman , Castle &; Stein , Entertainment Law . They had thoughtfully placed a marbleized mirror on the opposing wall ( actors love mirrors ) and Herman Strockmire Jr . was forced to take a depressing personal inventory as he stepped off the elevator into his own sagging , bulging reflection . He looked like shit . In the last ten years his Bavarian gene map had veered . The decade had turned him into a stocky carbon copy of his dead father . Herman Strockmire Sr. had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the humid heat of a Pittsburgh mill , each thudding , hammering stroke of the metal press pounding the poor , elder Herman shorter and lower , until the old German immigrant seemed like a fun-house distortion of a human being . Now , as Herman Jr . studied himself in the law firm 's marbleized mirror , he saw his dead father : short , Teutonic , absurd . The hand of gravity was reaching out with gnarled fingers and pulling him down toward the grave , while his runaway heart spun wildly out of control . Herman 's borrowed office at Lipman , Castle &; Stein was an accommodation that his dear friend , Barbra Streisand , had arranged for him . These power brokers were her show business lawyers and they constantly reminded him of their huge respect for her star power . $tar was spelled with a dollar sign at Lipman , Castle &; Stein . The partners , two Jerrys and a Marty , had acceded to Barbra 's " request " and loaned him a small , one-window office that overlooked Century City and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that defied natural selection Herman had learned that most agents and entertainment lawyers were named Jerry or Marty , with a liberal sprinkling of Sids . Herman had spent the last two weeks in this slick retreat , doing pretrial deps and federal court writs . Because the trial started tomorrow , Herman had driven in from Barbra and Jim 's beach house early that morning , via Malibu Canyon Drive , just before sun-up . Dear , sweet , politically conscious Barbra had not only prevailed upon her show biz attorneys to loan Herman the office while he was in L.A. , but she had lent him the use of the ocean front pool house at her Malibu estate while she and her husband James Brolin were on vacation in Corsica . Herman and his thirty-year-old daughter , Susan , had been residing there , using the cars and eating the food , and had permission to do so until Herman 's current federal case was adjudicated-which , he figured , would be in about two weeks-if he did n't die of a coronary first . He shuffled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like a sultan 's harem than a shitter . Black marble floors , brown Doric columns , and decorator washbasins wit arched dolphin faucets profiled under directional pin lights . The little , gilded , flippered critters spit water delicately into hammered artificial gold sinks . Herman hefted his briefcase full of writs , pretrial motions , and law books onto the marble counter and popped the latch . It wheezed open like a broken accordion . He rummage around inside for his pill bottles and , finding the Warfarin first , shook two of the little capsules into his palm . They were blood thinners to prevent strokes during an arrhythmia . He dug out the bottle of Digoxin that was supposed to control his heart rate , then grabbed a paper cup from the built-in dispenser . He had never before been in a corporate men 's room that supplied Dixie cups . Herman tossed the pills into his mouth and washed them down . That was when he got a second look at himself in the well-lit bathroom mirror . He was used up and tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no choice ; he had to go on . He was on a mission , maybe the most important of his life . An entire species of butterfly was about to be wiped out by biologically enhanced foods . It was n't just any butterfly he was fighting for , but the **26;239;TOOLONG monarch , the majestic creature that had introduced Herman to the wonders of nature as a child . He had studied the beautiful orange-and-black-winged treasures for hours as a boy , lying on his stomach in the grass behind his parents ' tiny row house , marveling at their delicate markings , seeing in them God 's divine artistry . The monarch butterfly , once the most common in North America , was now in danger of going onto the endangered species list . Unless Herman blocked the FDA , EPA , USDA , and all the other federal letter agencies that controlled bio-enhanced foods , these priceless treasures of nature might disappear forever , unintended victims of the new gene-spliced Frankenfoods . Specifically corn . His federal lawsuit was for injunctive relief and damages on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been filed and fast-tracked to beat the spring planting season . If successful , it would stop this year 's trans-genetic corn crop from going into the ground in May and would pay out damages to his two client organizations . However , the real reason for the suit was to force the government to reexamine the long-term , downstream effects of bio-enhanced food . Herman felt a surge of anger as he had these thoughts , and with it adrenaline coursed through his tired , sluggish body , doing god-knows-what to his already jackhammering heart . He fumed about his lawsuit and the arrogant disinterest of the government watchdog agencies and private labs he was suing . The biologically enhanced corn was engineered to kill off mites and pests that ate the cornstalks , but because of inadequate or sloppy testing , it was killing the monarch butterfly as well , and no one else seemed to give a damn . Herman stood in front of the men 's room mirror and glowered at his sagging jowls and shaggy , curly hair that always seemed unkempt . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had " mixed his numbers " again . Herman was colorblind and used a number scheme to stay in one color zone or another . He had the clothing taste of a mill worker , which , like his poor dead father , he 'd once been . He never paid attention to trends , always bought cheap , and wore it until the stitches broke . After all , he reasoned , it was hard to dress for success when you were built like a steamer trunk . His lovely daughter , Susan , light of his life , friend , colleague , and paralegal , carefully chose his court attire , sewing little numbers on the labels of matching outfits . Unfortunately , he had dressed in the dark this morning , not wanting to wake her . She 'd been up all night , typing pretrial motions . He had decided this would be a number-3 day , but standing in the dark closet , squinting at the numbers , he had mixed some 8s in with the 3s . He now realized he had on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow tie . He thought he must look like the host of a Saturday-morning cartoon show . Herman turned away from the mirror , unable to stomach any further self-examination , grabbed his heavy briefcase , then lugged it down the hall to the borrowed office , turned on the lights , and sat behind his desk . Across the Avenue of the Stars the sound stages of Twentieth Century Fox movie studio were already teeming with activity . The productions started very early , almost at the crack of dawn . At 8 A.M. trucks , cars , and actors were already bustling between sound stages , well into their morning labors . Lipman , Castle &; Stein took a more gentlemanly approach to the morning . He 'd learned that agents and lawyers in show business started at around nine-thirty with a leisurely power breakfast , usually at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills , or Jerry 's Deli in the Valley . Most of the hip Lipman crowd came sharking in at 10:30 or 11:00 toting their expensive wafer cases-young , lean , sculpted men and women with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling , lumbering walrus in this sleek , fast-moving school of piranhas . He decided not to tell Susan about the tachycardia when she got in . She would just insist he go back to the hospital . The doctors at Cedars-Sinai had " converted " him once already last week , using medication . It had taken four hours on an IV bag . His condition was called ventricular arrhythmia , which was more dangerous than the supraventricular kind . The first episode had hit him six months ago without warning . His second arrhythmia occurred four months later , and now this one made two in ten days . Not a good sign . The cardio docs at Cedars were urging that a " procedure " be performed . Procedure was their PR-friendly way of saying operation . But Herman could n't take two weeks off now . He had just dragged three federal agencies and four private research labs kicking and screaming into court . This case finally had a hearing date set for tomorrow , and if he missed it he 'd never get back in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the new crop of genetically engineered corn went into the ground , it guaranteed that millions more monarch butterflies would die . Herman was determined to prevent this from happening . He felt as if he was the only one left protecting one of God 's great treasures . In the meantime he was popping more and more pills , which seemed to be doing him less and less good . The morning dragged by like mud oozing downhill . It was eleven o'clock when Susan finally came through the door and dropped her briefcase on the chair opposite his desk . Every time he saw her he was overcome by her style and beauty . She had inherited all of her mother 's physical perfection and mental activity but none of her shallowness . Okay , maybe that was harsh , but , damn it , that 's the way he felt . His ex had a keen mind but no interest in using it . Lillian was a wealthy country club brat who had rebelled against her waspish upbringing by choosing Herman Strockmire Jr . over a field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been puzzled by her choice , until he finally realized it was just her spoiled way of giving her domineering father the finger . Take that , Daddy , you controlling , overbearing shitheel ! Lillian had said she loved Herman 's idealism , that she had never met anyone with thoughts as deep as his ... thoughts about the environment , or civil rights , or governmental abuse . She once complained that all her country club friends ever worried about was their golf scores . She fascinated him like a delicate crystal treasure . He used to marvel at her classic , fine-boned beauty as she flitted around in their small , rundown Boston apartment , fluffing pillows and promising to do the dishes that were piling up in the sink . Her allowance , given to her by her father each month , was more than Strockmire Sr. took home from his mill job , and it helped Herman through the last year of Harvard Law School . So , although he resented taking the money , it allowed him to quit his side jobs and concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut to get his diploma . However , Lillian soon found out that a steady diet of idealism and heavy thoughts , like her membership in the Vegan Society , was boring . Bottom line : Herman was pretty much of a drag . " You 're no fun , " she 'd pout . " No fun and always brooding . Would it kill you to smile , for Chrissake ? " But Herman , flesh out of law school , was already overwhelmed with the injustices he saw all around him . Injustices that nobody else seemed to care about because there was no money to be made in fixing them . He passed on an offer from an old-line Philadelphia law firm in order to pursue his passion for important legal redress , filing a rash of lawsuits : Miller v. USDA-a drug-testing case ; Billingsley v. CIA-domestic espionage ; Clark v. FBI-Fourth Amendment search and seizure . More and more , Herman found he had powerful federal agencies on the other side of the " v. " His IRS tax audits became annual and punitive . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was constantly fighting city hall , overmatched , and behind the eight ball . Like most members of spirited-but-pampered species , Lillian soon flitted away from him , as beautiful and carefree as the monarch butterfly he now defended , leaving behind one lasting treasure-his daughter , Susan . Lillian had bestowed her physical genes on Susan as surely as the old mill worker had cursed Herman Jr . with his . But Susan also had Herman 's single-mindedness and sense of social outrage . Unlike her mother , she never became bored with Herman 's struggle . She often seemed more dismayed at the injustices they fought against than he did . Sometimes Herman Strockmire Jr . wondered how he and Lillian had made such a remarkable creature . Both of them were so flawed : Herman-plodding , overinvolved , and physically unremarkable ; Lillian-beautiful , pampered , and quick-tempered . In Susan , they had filtered out their worst traits without losing any of their best . Talk about miracles . " You heard from Roland yet ? " Susan asked , carrying a stack of pretrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side table , kicked off her shoes , then sat and put her nyloned feet up on his desk . " Nope . Guess he 's still up in San Francisco looking for the lab where those pricks are hiding their research . Once I get the right data bank I 'll spring a discovery motion on them , and hopefully they wo n't have time to digitally erase the evidence before I get ahold of it .
