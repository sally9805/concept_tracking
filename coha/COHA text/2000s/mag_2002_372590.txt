Michelle Biederman has dropped by for a pop before work . " We may as well do the acne scars too , " says Dr. Robert Weiss , as he positions the firing end of his Cool Touch laser in a bed of fine lines just below her right eye . Pop ! goes the laser , emitting a pulse of invisible light and a white puff of subzero cooling spray . Biederman feels something like the snap of a rubber band . After Weiss blasts the wrinkles under the right eye , he does the left . By the time he gets to the acne scars on her chin , her right eye is getting red and puffy . <P> That 's what Dr. Weiss is after . The idea is to heat up the underlying dermis , stimulating fibroblast cells to produce collagen , which pushes out fine wrinkles and scars . " This temperature sensor is monitoring things , " says Weiss , 49 , as he points to a fail-safe device on the laser . " If the temperature rises too high in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Doctors have been going after wrinkles for years with face-lifts and now laser and chemical peels , which burn away the epidermis and 50 to 100 microns of dermis , resulting in fresh skin growth . What 's new is the emergence of " nonablative " lasers and light sources , including Cool Touch , manufactured by ICN Pharmaceuticals of Costa Mesa , Calif. , and IPL ( Intense Pulsed Light ) , made by Lumenis of Santa Clara , Calif . Both technologies , when used by a skilled physician , avoid even temporary damage to the epidermis and leave few if any telltale signs . For that reason  --  and because quick sessions can be scheduled before work or during lunchtime  --  these new treatments are popular among busy professionals . Cool Touch estimates that 250,000 of its procedures will be performed this year , up from 150,000 in 2001 . <P> These new lunch-hour face-lifts will not get rid of deep wrinkles . But they typically eliminate about half the fine wrinkles that make many boomer men and women look older than they feel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments , at $250 to $550 apiece . For Biederman , who was originally treated by Weiss three years ago , this is a maintenance visit that she makes once or twice a year to keep her fibroblasts producing collagen . She has also had IPL treatments to get rid of spider veins and age spots , but she has never considered a full surgical face-lift . " That 's overkill , " she says . " I would also rather spend money doing this than $150 on eye cream that does n't work . " After her treatment , Biederman , 47 , will drive 20 minutes to Owings Mills , Md. , where she works as a human-resources supervisor . By the time she arrives , the redness and puffiness will be gone . <P> Weiss is booked three months in advance  --  and a quarter of his patients are men . Baltimore financial manager Adam Fein , 44 , was not looking for cosmetic surgery when he wandered in with a wart on his foot . But six treatments later , his acne scars and spider veins are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it works , " says Fein , " why not take advantage of it ? " <P> In Washington , Dr. Eliot Battle , a Harvard researcher , has opened a new clinic called Cultura : Skin Care for All Skin Colors . He is using Cool Touch on patients with darker complexions , whose skin often gets discolored by harsher treatments . In New York City , many financial professionals make a lunch-hour pilgrimage to the uptown dermatology clinics of Neil Sadick , Lori Polis and Roy Geronemus.
