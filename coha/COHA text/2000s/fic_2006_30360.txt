THE TIME OF OUR SINGING By RICHARD POWERS FARRAR , STRAUS AND GIROUX DECEMBER 1961 In some empty hall , my brother is still singing . His voice has n't dampened yet . Not altogether . The rooms where he sang still hold an impression , their walls dimpled with his sound , awaiting some future phonograph capable of replaying them . My brother Jonah stands fixed , leaning against a piano . He 's just twenty . The sixties have only begun . The country still dozes in its last pretended innocence . No one has heard of Jonah Strom but our family , what 's left of it . We 've come to Durham , North Carolina , the old music building at Duke . He has made it to the finals of a national vocal competition he 'll later deny ever having entered . Jonah stands alone , just right of center stage . My brother towers in place , listing a little , backing up into the crook of the grand piano , his only safety . He curls forward , the scroll on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano edge , while right hand cups in front of him , holding some letter , now oddly lost . He grins at the odds against being here , breathes in , and sings . One moment , the Erl-King is hunched on my brother 's shoulder , whispering a blessed death . In the next , a trapdoor opens up in the air and my brother is elsewhere , teasing out Dowland of all things , a bit of ravishing sass for this stunned lieder crowd , who ca n't grasp the web that slips over them : Time stands still with gazing on her face , Stand still and gaze for minutes , hours , and years to her give place . All other things shall change , but she remains the same , Till heavens changed have their course and time hath lost his name . Two stanzas , and his tune is done . Silence hangs over the hall . It drifts above the seats like a balloon across the horizon . For two downbeats , even breathing is a crime . Then there 's no surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude of hands starts time up again , sending the dart to its target and my brother on to the things that will finish him . This is how I see him , although he 'll live another third of a century . This is the moment when the world first finds him out , the night I hear where his voice is headed . I 'm up onstage , too , at the battered Steinway with its caramel action . I accompany him , trying to keep up , trying not to listen to that siren voice that says , Stop your fingers , crash your boat on the reef of keys , and die in peace . Though I make no fatal fumbles , that night is not my proudest as a musician . After the concert , I 'll ask my brother again to let me go , to find an accompanist who can do him justice . And again he 'll refuse . " I already have one , Joey . " I 'm there , up onstage with him . But at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always sit at concerts : eight rows back , just inside the left aisle . I sit where I can see my own : fingers moving , where I can study my brother 's face-close enough to see everything , but far enough to survive seeing . Stage fright ought to paralyze us . Backstage is a single bleeding ulcer . Performers who 've spent their whole youth training for this moment now prepare to spend their old age explaining why it did n't go as planned . The hall fills with venom and envy , families who 've traveled hundreds of miles to see their lives ' pride reduced to runner-up . My brother alone is fearless . He has already paid . This public contest has nothing to do with music . Music means those years of harmonizing together , still in the shell of our family , before that shell broke open and burned . Jonah glides through the backstage fright , the dressing rooms full of well-bred nausea , on a cloud , as though through a dress rehearsal for a performance already canceled . Onstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The drape of his hand on the piano 's black enamel ravishes his listeners , the essence of his sound before he even makes one . I see him on this night of his first open triumph , from four decades on . He still has that softness around his eyes that later life will crack and line . His jaw quakes a little on Dowland 's quarter notes , but the notes do not . He drops his head toward his right shoulder as he lifts to the high C , shrinking from his entranced listeners . The face shudders , a look only I can see , from my perch behind the piano . The broken-ridged bridge of his nose , his bruised brown lips , the two bumps of bone riding his eyes : almost my own face , but keener , a year older , a shade lighter . That breakaway shade : the public record of our family 's private crime . My brother sings to save the good and make the wicked take their own lives . At twenty , he 's already intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sound that holds his audience stilled for a few stopped seconds before they can bring themselves to clap . In the soar of that voice , they hear the rift it floats over . The year is a snowy black-and-white signal coming in on rabbit ears . The world of our childhood-the A-rationing , radio-fed world pitched in that final war against evil-falls away into a Kodak tableau . A man has flown in space . Astronomers pick up pulses from starlike objects . Across the globe , the United States draws to an inside straight . Berlin 's tinderbox is ready to flash at any moment . Southeast Asia babies piles up behind the viewing glass of maternity hospitals from Bar Harbor to San Diego . Our hatless boy president plays touch football on the White House lawn . The continent is awash in spies , beatniks , and major appliances . Montgomery hits the fifth year of an impasse that wo n't occur to me until five more have passed . And seven hundred unsuspecting people in Durham , North Carolina , disappear , lulled into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , no one has heard my brother sing but us . Now the word is out . In the applause , I watch that rust red face waver behind his smile 's hasty barricade . He looks around for an offstage shadow to duck back into , but it 's too late . He breaks into leaky grins and , with one practiced bow , accepts his doom . They bring us back twice ; Jonah has to drag me out the second time . Then the judges call out the winners in each range-three , two , one-as if Duke were Cape Canaveral , this music contest another Mercury launch , and America 's Next Voice another Shepard or Grissom . We stand in the wings , the other tenors forming a ring around Jonah , already hating him and heaping him with praise . I fight the urge to work this group , to assure them my brother is not special , that each performer has sung as well as anyone . The others sneak glances at Jonah , studying his unstudied posture . They go over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the left hook of Dowland , striving for that floating sustain above the high A. The thing they can never stand far back enough to see has already swallowed my brother whole . My brother hangs back against the fly ropes in his concert black , appraising the choicer sopranos . Stands still and gazes . He sings to them , private encores in his mind . Everyone knows he 's won , and Jonah struggles to make it mean nothing . The judges call his name . Invisible people cheer and whistle . He is their victory for democracy , and worse . Jonah turns to me , drawing out the moment . " Joey . Brother . There 's got to be a more honest way to make a living . " He breaks another rule by dragging me onstage with him to collect the trophy . And his first public conquest rushes to join the past . Afterward , we move through a sea of small delights and epic disappointments . Congratulating lines form up around the winners . In ours , a woman hunched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My brother amazes me , extending his performance , as if he 's really the ethereal creature she mistakes him for . " Sing forever , " she says , until her caretaker whisks her off . A few well-wishers behind her , a ramrod retired colonel twitches . His face is a hostile muddle , duped in a way he ca n't dope out . I feel the man 's righteousness , well before he reaches us , the rage we repeatedly provoke in his people simply by appearing in public . He waits out his moment in the queue , his anger 's fuse shortening with this line . Reaching the front , he charges . I know what he 'll say before he gets it out . He studies my brother 's face like a thwarted anthropologist . " What exactly are you boys ? " The question we grew up on . The question no Strom ever figured out how to read , let alone answer . As often as I 've heard it , I still seize up . Jonah and I do n't even bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I make some motions , ready to smooth over the misunderstanding . But the man backs me off with a look that chases me from adolescence for good . Jonah has his answer ; I have mine . But he 's the one in the spotlight . My brother inhales , as if we 're still onstage , the smallest grace note of breath that would lead me into the downbeat . For a semiquaver , he 's about to launch into " Fremd bin ich eingezogen . " Instead , he pitches his reply , buffo-style , up into comic head tones : " I am my mammy 's ae bairn , Wi ' unco folk I weary , Sir ... " His first full night of adulthood , but still a child , giddy with just being named America 's Next Voice . His unaccompanied encore turns heads all around us . Jonah ignores them all . It 's 1961 . We 're in a major university town . You ca n't string a guy up for high spirits . They have n't strung up anyone for high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . My brother laughs through the Burns couplet , thinking to leave the colonel sheepish with eight bars of good-natured cheek . The man goes livid . He tenses and puckers , ready to wrestle Jonah to the ground . But the eager line of admirers moves him along , out the stage door , toward what the prophetic look spreading across my brother 's face already knows will be a paralyzing stroke . At the end of the conga line , our father and sister wait . This is how I see them , too , from the far side of a life . Still ours , still a family . Da grins like the lost immigrant he is . A quarter century in this country , and he still walks around like he 's expecting to be detained . " You pronounciate German like a Polack . Who the hell taught you your vowels ? A disgrace . Eine Schande ! " Jonah caps a hand over our father 's mouth . " Shah . Da . For Christ 's sake . Remind me never to take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Polack ' ? You 're crazy . That 's what they 're called , bub . " " Yeah , hub . " Ruth , our mimic , nails him . Even at sixteen , she 's passed for the man more than once , over the phone . " What the hell else you going to call people from Polackia ? " The crowd flinches again , that look that pretends not to . We 're a moving violation of everything in their creed . But out here in classically trained public , they keep that major-key smile . They push on to the other winners , leaving us , for a last moment , once again our own safe nation . Father and eldest son reel about on the remnants of Schubert still hanging about the emptied hall . They lean on each other 's shoulders . " Trust me , " the older one tells the younger . " I 've known a few Polacks in my day . I almost married one . " " I could have been a Polack ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Polack in one of many alternate universes ? " They babble to each other , the shorthand jokes of his profession . Clowning for the one none of us will name this night , the one to whom we offer every note of our contest prize . Ruth stands in the stage footlights , almost auburn , but otherwise the sole keeper of our mother 's features in this world . My mother , the woman my father almost did n't marry , a woman more and longer American than anyone in this hall tonight . " You did good , too , Joey , " my little sister makes sure to tell me . " You know . Perfect and all . " I hug her for her lie , and she glows under my grasp , a ready jewel . We wander back to Da and Jonah . Assembled again : the surviving four-fifths of the Strom family chorale . But Da and Jonah do n't need either of us accompanists . Da has hold of the Erl-King motif , and Jonah thumps along , his three-and-a-half-octave voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hand . He hums the way he wanted me to play it . The way it ought to be played , in heaven 's headliner series . Ruth and I draw near , despite ourselves , to add the inner lines . People smile as they pass , in pity or shame , some imagined difference . But Jonah is the evening 's rising star , momentarily beyond scorn . The audience this night will claim they heard him . They 'll tell their children how that chasm opened up , how the floor dropped out of the old Duke concert hall and left them hanging in the vacuum they thought it was music 's job to fill . But the person they 'll recall wo n't be my brother . They 'll tell of sitting up in their seats at the first sound of that transmuting voice . But the voice they 'll remember wo n't be his . His growing band of listeners will chase Jonah 's performances , prize his tickets , follow his career even into those last , decoupled years . Connoisseurs will search down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . My brother 's sound could never be recorded . He had a thing against the permanent , a hatred of being fixed that 's audible in every note he ever laid down . He was Orpheus in reverse : Look forward , and all that you love will disappear . It 's 1961 . Jonah Strom , America 's Next Voice , is twenty . This is how I see him , forty years on , eight years older now than my older brother will ever be . The hall has emptied ; my brother still sings . He sings through to the double bar , the tempo falling to nothing as it passes through the fermata 's blackness , a boy singing to a mother who can no longer hear him . That voice was so pure , it could make heads of state repent . But it sang knowing just what shape rode along behind it . And if any voice could have sent a message back to warn the past and correct the unmade future , it would have been my brother 's . WINTER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except his family , singing together on those postwar winter nights , with music their last line of defense against the outside and the encroaching cold . They lived in half of a three-story Jersey freestone house that had weathered over half a century to a chocolate brown , tucked up in the northwest corner of Manhattan , a neglected enclave of mixed , mottled blocks where Hamilton Heights shaded off into Washington Heights . They rented , the immigrant David Strom never trusting the future enough to own anything that would n't fit into a waiting suitcase . Continues ...
