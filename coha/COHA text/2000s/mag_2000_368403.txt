The U.S. Capitol dome , symbol of our democracy , turns out to be cast iron painted to look like stone  --  a massive , mighty but hollow facade . There must be a hidden meaning in that . In this five-episode series , author-illustrator David Macaulay ( The Way Things Work ) looks at megastructures  --  bridges , domes , skyscrapers , dams and tunnels  --  and the aspirations they embody . The series is probably a touch light for architecture buffs . For the layperson , it 's an engaging look at how and why humankind shaped the landscape with seemingly impossible structures , and was shaped in turn by them . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
