Triple gold medalist Fu Mingxia does n't expect anyone to remember her . Sure , China 's mop-haired diving diva was the youngest gold medalist in Barcelona , at 13 , and a double winner in Atlanta . But when she ducked out of the limelight at 18 , her whispery voice citing mental exhaustion , the former child prodigy figured her glory days were done . Even today as she trains for Sydney , Fu downplays her talents . " I 'm old and a little fat now , " jokes the 22-year-old . " I 'm yesterday 's news . " <P> Until next week , anyway . Despite her doubts , beating the waif who enchanted Barcelona and dazzled Atlanta represents a high degree of difficulty . Fu 's jumping-bean antics have matured into an aquatic elegance that could raise this veteran above a crop of agile young rivals , some of whom perform the scary dives that were once her exclusive domain . <P> Fu never expected to be training for the 2000 Olympics . She left competition in 1996 and dived into normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . For two years , not once did she clamber onto a board . " The last thing I wanted to do was dive , " she recalls . " I just wanted to be a kid without any pressures . " <P> Childhood is expendable for China 's sporting machine , which churns out young athletes to boost the country 's image . Flexible first-graders are packed off to gymnastics and diving camps while their lankier counterparts head for the volleyball courts . Fu joined the diving assembly line at age 7 and was shipped off to a Beijing sports school a couple of years later . Homesick , she cried for the first few months . But during nine-hour practices she was trained to empty herself of all emotion , particularly fear . <P> Soon Fu was skimming so close to the board during her dives that her short hair sometimes brushed the end of the platform before she sliced into the water . She saw her parents once a year . Occasionally they would come to diving meets in her native Hubei province , and Fu would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually , she knew they had visited only by the care packages her mother left in the locker room . <P> It was while daydreaming during an economics lecture  --  and have n't we all ?  --  in 1998 that China 's Olympic poster girl realized that diving could actually be fun . She missed the water , the exhilaration of soaring through the air and sliding into the tank with barely a ripple . " Taking a break took the pressure off diving , " she says . " It made me realize that I loved the sport and that I could do it on my own terms . " <P> In January , less than a year after she re-emerged , her crisp dives captured a silver medal at the Diving World Cup . The gold went to 18-year-old compatriot Guo Jingjing , Fu 's main rival in the individual events and partner in synchronized diving , a debut sport at Sydney . " Guo is China 's young star , " Fu says with a smile . " But do n't count the big sister out yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her country , not for her coach , not for her fans , but for herself . The nine-hour practices have been replaced by a more manageable five hours . " Practicing just for the sake of practicing is pointless , " Fu says , snapping her gum . She enlivens drills by blasting pop music , thumping techno beats that she hopes will propel her past Guo.
