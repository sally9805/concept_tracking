The Winterthur Museum , Garden and Library in Winterthur , Delaware ( see Pl . II ) , has enthralled collectors and delighted the public for fifty years . In honor of our founding in October 1951 , our anniversary festivities continue through the spring of this year . We are honored by this special issue of The Magazine ANTIQUES , and welcome this opportunity to showcase our progress in collecting , exhibiting , and interpreting the arts made or used in America between 1640 and 1860 . In this issue we share fresh Insights into the collecting achievements of our founder , Henry Francis du Pont ( Pl. 1 ) , and we present new acquisitions and research since his death . We also launch a new vision to build upon our excellence and to provide ongoing inspiration to visitors for the next W years . Born at Winterthur in 1880 , Henry Francis du Pont , also known as H. E or Harry , was the third generation of du Ponts to dwell on the grounds . He was the great-grandson of the DuPont Company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Winterthur had once been part of E. I. du Pont 's estate , and was split off to become a farm for his daughter , Evelina Gabrielle ( 1796-1863 ) and son-in-law , Jacques Antoine Bidermann ( 1790-1865 ) . They named it for Bidermann 's ancestral home in Switzerland . By the time H. F du Pont inherited the property from his father , Henry Algernon du Pont ( 1838-1926 ) , the acreage had been expanded from the original 450 acres to 2,400 . Young Harry grew up in a decidedly formal and European atmosphere ( see Fig. 1 ) , like others of his social class . An undistinguished student , he did not take a serious interest in his studies until he discovered horticulture and agriculture courses at Harvard University 's Bussey Institution.I He first revealed a penchant for design when he became involved with his father 's project to remodel and expand the house at Winterthur in 1902 . That fall his mother , Mary Pauline Foster ( 1849-1902 ) , died-a devastating loss that caused him to give up plans for graduate study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . When the elder du Pont was elected to the United States Senate in 1906 , he gradually transferred management duties to his son , until by 1914 , H. E was in charge of the entire estate , including the considerable agricultural enterprises of Winterthur Farms . H. E set about improving the Winterthur herd of dairy cattle . In 1916 he married Ruth Wales ( 18891967 ) of New York City in an elaborate ceremony in Hyde Park , New York . Although they maintained other residences , the couple made their home at Winterthur , and H. F continued to oversee the interior decoration . His taste remained European until he was in his early forties , when he first took notice of American antiques . In 1923 , while visiting Electra Havemeyer Webb at Shelburne , Vermont , he was struck by the colors and simple design of an eighteenth-century New England pine dresser filled with pink and white Staffordshire ceramics ( PI . III ) . The dresser might not have sparked an outright conversion had its discovery not been quickly followed by a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beauport , in Gloucester , Massachusetts . There he found Photograph // the inspiration for the Winterthur we know In the late 1950s and 1960s , thanks to the generosity of Henry Francis du Pont 's cousin-in-law H. Rodney Sharp ( 1880-1968 ) , Winterthur acquired a group of historic buildings in the small tidewater town of Odessa , Delaware , south of Wilmington.3 Odessa contained some of Delaware 's most important eighteenth-century Georgian architecture ( see Pl . V ) , and it offered something H.E could never achieve at Winterthur-a village intact on its original site . Odessa 's charm and history continue to attract and fascinate visitors today . Du Pont collected voraciously throughout his life and adapted spaces in his former residence accordingly . The bowling alley became a lane of shop fronts and the squash court a town square flanked by the facades of four early American buildings . He contin ually improved the period rooms , upgrading a furniture form , acquiring the perfect object or textile to accompany a color scheme , or creating a vignette of historical as well as artistic significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executors , he listed elusive objects and comments on where to install them if acquired . Surrounding the 175-room mansion and inspiring many of its interior color schemes is the Winterthur garden , certainly the greatest example of an English " wild garden " in this country.4 Just as he composed rooms , du Pont the artist improved upon nature , adding color , creating a composition , or opening up a vista onto a sixty-six-acre trompel'oeil masterpiece that brilliantly belies its artifice ( see Pl . VII ) . Du Pont 's genius was born of his own discipline in mediating the relationship between his taste and his acquisitiveness . However beloved the plant or the object , it had to contribute to a greater aesthetic experience . Fortunately he had ample land and resources to add settings and experiences for his collection and garden . The catalyst for his genius was his own pursuit of excellence , in quality and in education . Only a year after opening his house as a public museum he pioneered a partnership with the University of Delaware to train decorative arts curators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American decorative arts scholarship . The library du Pont founded is world-renowned for the study of American arts and material culture . The conservation laboratory is host to one of the most respected art conservation graduate programs in the world . The first five articles in this special issue highlight du Pont as the great collector and tastemaker of the colonial revival . The following five essays address new directions for acquisitions , room installations , and research . They demonstrate Winterthur 's continued commitment to preserve and enhance its collection and programs ; to further the understanding , appreciation , and enjoyment of American heritage by people of all ages ; and to foster , conduct , and publish fundamental research in the fields of American art , material culture , history , and preservation . Of the approximately eighty-five thousand objects in the Winterthur collection , more than twenty-two thousand have been acquired since du Pont 's death , strengthening our ability to teach and exhibit the American material culture of our forebears . Yet Winterthur is much more than an assemblage of distinguished components . H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed into a magnificent country estate modeled on English stately homes . He was the consummate country gentleman , and he nurtured each element of a great country house : its history , architecture , garden , collection , library , and agriculture . He was known to describe himself as a farmer , and so he was . That same relentless pursuit of excellence resulted in one of the finest dairy herds in American history ( see Fig. 2 ) . Winterthur was home to more than 250 people who worked the farms ; ran the post office and train station ; staffed the mansion ; and cared for the collection , garden , orchards , and golf course . When du Pont began to plan for the Sidebar today-rooms of early architecture decorated with American antiques . With Sleeper 's assistance , H.

In 1924 the American Wing opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City . In 1926 John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colonial Williamsburg in Williamsburg , Virginia . When Henry Algernon du Pont died late in December 1926 , leaving Winterthur to his son , there was no longer any question about what H. E intended to do with the family home . Thus began Henry Francis du Pont 's legendary pursuit of American arts that continued unabated for the rest of his life . By 1929 he had begun a huge addition to Winterthur that dwarfed the family homestead , all to present his growing collection of early American architecture and furnishings . As early as 1930 he considered turning the house into a museum . In 1948 he began construction of another residence on the estate , and early in 1951 , he gave the last dinner party in his boyhood home and moved out The Winterthur Museum was born .

He kept intact nearly one thousand acres , the core of Winterthur that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design for everything he orchestrated at Winterthur . He integrated masterpieces within rooms , rooms with the garden outside , and the garden with the surrounding farmland landscape ( see Pl . VI ) . That grand design was a crown that bore all of Winterthur 's many jewels . Winter-thur was and remains a great American country estate , perhaps the most culturally significant of all that survive as public institutions . As we celebrate our golden anniversary , we commit ourselves to preserving the estate and its history We pledge ourselves to the vision H. E du Pont expressed for Winterthur in the last decade of his life : I sincerely hope that the Museum will be a continuing source of inspiration and education for all time , and that the gardens and grounds will themselves be a country place museum where visitors may enjoy as I have , not only the flowers , trees , and shrubs , but also the sunlit meadows , shady wood paths , and the peace and great calm of a country place which has been loved and taken care of for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country estate Museum ... to show the Americans of the future what a country place and farm were like.5 And so it shall . // <p>
