After Sept. 11 , 2001 , President George W. Bush made three major changes to the grand strategy that the U.S. had pursued for a half-century . He reduced reliance on permanent alliances and institutions , broadened the traditional right of pre-emption into a new doctrine of preventive war and advocated coercive democratization as a solution to the problem of terrorism in the Middle East . His September 2002 National Security Strategy was widely seen as revolutionary . <P> The ultimate success or failure of Bush 's effort at transforming American grand strategy will be judged by history . Top officials believe that no matter who wins the 2008 election , the logic of the situation will compel him ( or her ) to follow the broad lines of Bush 's approach . As Vice President Dick Cheney has said , " Ten years from now , we 'll look back on this period of time and see that liberating 50 million people in Afghanistan and Iraq really did represent a major , fundamental shift , obviously , in U.S. policy in terms of how we dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentally changed circumstances in that part of the world . " <P> Perhaps . But it might help to look at the history of previous efforts at transformation . <P> Over the past century , half a dozen Presidents have tried to radically transform American strategy . At the turn of the century , Theodore Roosevelt sought to adapt U.S. foreign policy to match the nation 's new position in world politics . But while he persuaded Congress to back his efforts to bolster U.S. hegemony in the western hemisphere , he failed to overcome long-standing suspicions of balance-of-power politics in Congress and among the U.S. public . As a result , his transformation proved untenable . Woodrow Wilson came to office focused on domestic issues but ultimately intervened in World War I , leading him to envision a transformation of world politics through the spread of democracy and the creation of new international institutions . But his reach exceeded his grasp , and the succeeding decades witnessed the rejection of his policies and the return of American attitudes that favored a more traditional distancing of the country from the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lasting success was limited to the team of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman . Roosevelt used the opportunity provided by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to commit the U.S. to multilateralism . In the words of Yale historian John Gaddis , Roosevelt expanded American hegemony by scrapping both isolation and unilateralism : " He never neglected , as Wilson did , the need to keep proclaimed interests from extending beyond actual capabilities . " He linked Wilsonian ideals to a realist vision , combining the attractive power of his Four Freedoms with the idea of four policemen ( later five , with the addition of China ) as permanent members of the U.N . Security Council . And in the Bretton Woods economic institutions , he laid a basis for global economic stability . <P> F.D.R. initiated a strategy that lasted more than a half-century , in part because Truman , his successor , adapted his policies to the changing situation at the end of the war by adding the Marshall Plan and NATO to contain Soviet power . Subsequent cold war Presidents made incremental changes within that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
