For most foreign leaders traveling to South Africa , dropping in on Nelson Mandela is the equivalent of meeting the Queen in London  --  a task both customary and pleasant . But for President Bush 's visit to the country on July 8 , a session with the world 's most sanctified icon of social justice " is not on the schedule , " a senior White House official tells TIME . This is probably no oversight . The former South African President is , after all , among the most persistent and vitriolic critics of the Bush Administration 's Iraq policy . <P> Just last Friday , Mandela lauded French President Jacques Chirac for opposing the U.S. invasion of Iraq  --  and that was one of Mandela 's tamer shots during what has been a nine-month barrage of criticism . In January , Mandela called Bush a " President who has no foresight , who can not think properly , " and accused him of " wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust . " Mandela has also accused the U.S. of ignoring the U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has repeatedly called the U.S. a " threat to world peace . " During a visit to Ireland last week , he told his audience that the U.S. and Bush " are a danger to the world . " <P> The White House , for its part , seems content to let Bush 's itinerary serve as riposte . Despite Mandela 's " unfortunate comments not just about the President but also about America in general , " the White House official says , Bush means " no disrespect " by not meeting with Mandela . " We 're focused on spending time with those who are in office now . " <P> Perhaps , but Mandela may have anticipated the snub . Asked at the press conference last Friday if he would discuss the Iraq war with President Bush , he replied , " I know he 's coming to see President Thabo Mbeki , but I can not be sure if he 's going to want to meet me . So I wo n't be able to tell him anything . " And Mandela seems ready to initiate detente @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added , " and I do n't have to repeat it .
