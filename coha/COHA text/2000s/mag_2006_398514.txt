Section : ELECTION 2006 AFTERSHOCKS <p> George Herbert Walker Bush is a proud father ; tears easily come to his eyes when he thinks of his children , all of them , and there is gracious deference in his tone when he talks about the son he calls , with emphasis , " The President . " He is not given to boasting about or bragging on his family ; he still hears his mother 's voice warning him to avoid " the Great I Am , " but several times over the past few years the 41st president has mentioned to visitors that the 43rd president has read the Bible in its entirety  --  not once , the father says , but twice , sticking two fingers in the air . If so , then the incumbent may recall the Song of Moses : " Remember the days of old , consider the years of many generations ; ask thy father , and he will show thee ; thy elders , and they will tell thee . " <p> Ask thy father , and he will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Bush seems to be taking . Last week the president lost both houses of Congress and 16 more Americans died in Iraq , bringing the U.S. death toll to 2,844 , with little discernible progress in sight . The war there has now lasted 44 months , the amount of time that elapsed between Pearl Harbor and VJ Day . <p> In a conference room filled with commemorative shotguns in his Houston offices last Wednesday , the father settled in to watch his son 's post-election press conference on TV . Lunching on pizza , Bush Senior listened as George W. Bush said the loss of Congress was a " thumping , " promised to " work with " a commission on Iraq chaired by James A. Baker III and Lee Hamilton , and announced that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was resigning . Within two hours the president was in the Oval Office with Rumsfeld and his replacement : Robert M. Gates , Bush Senior 's CIA director and the president of Texas A &M; University , the home of Bush 41 's presidential library . <p> In Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled away from their pizza . Reporters were calling and e-mailing : would 41 talk about 43 's shake-up ? The answer was no , though two perfunctory statements were issued ( one for the College Station Eagle and one , as the former president put it , " for everybody else " ) . Still , the reality spoke for itself . Dad 's team was back  --  a remarkable course correction in the political life of the son and , quite possibly , in the life of the nation . <p> The American people , as politicians like to say , spoke last week  --  and spoke in no uncertain terms . The 2006 vote does not suggest an eagerness for a sharp left turn . It seems , rather , to be a plea for a shift from the hard right of the neoconservatives to the center represented by the old man in Houston . The re-emergence of Iraq Study Group voices such as Baker , Gates and Alan Simpson  --  all longtime friends of Bush Senior  --  is not unlike the entrance of Fortinbras at the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the removal of Rumsfeld  --  an ancient rival of Bush Senior 's from the Ford days  --  is a move toward the broad middle . The apparent triumph of pragmatism over ideology on Iraq was welcome news , at least to the public . In the new NEWSWEEK Poll , 67 percent favor Bush Senior 's internationalist approach to foreign policy over his son 's more unilateral course . <p> Did 41 help bring Gates to the Pentagon ? The White House denies it , but , as a Bush friend told NEWSWEEK , " his fingerprints are all over this . " ( The friend refused to be identified for fear of alienating the family . ) Given the mists of secrecy that envelop the 41-43 relationship , it is striking that the broad Bush circle believes he had a hand in the Rumsfeld succession : as an old CIA director , 41 rarely leaves any clues at all . <p> What the two Bushes discuss has long been a subject of endless guesswork . " In my experience , the two men spent most of their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " former White House chief of staff Andy Card told NEWSWEEK . " They spoke to each other much more as father and son rather than as president and former president . " Still , politics and policy do come up . " It would be wrong to assume that they never discuss Iraq , the state of play in the world and some personalities , " Card said . " But it would also be wrong to assume that they discuss these things all the time . They are mutually deferential to one another . " <p> The Bush family psychodrama is the stuff of perennial speculation but little information , since the two people who know the most about it  --  the father and the son  --  speak of it so infrequently . Yet its complexity , its blend of love and rivalry , is rich analytical territory . ( Maureen Dowd of The New York Times , an unlikely e-mail pal of 41 's , has spent so much time contemplating the generational drama that she ultimately published an excellent book on the topic , " Bushworld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the most revealing on-the-record remark about their relationship made by either man , the son once told Bob Woodward that his father is " the wrong father to appeal to in terms of strength . There is a higher father that I appeal to . " <p> As the war has gone badly and the years have ticked by  --  2003 , 2004 , 2005 and now much of 2006  --  the senior President Bush , the man who managed to capture just 37 percent of the vote in 1992 , has grown in stature . Raising taxes and capping domestic spending in 1990 , refusing to exceed the United Nations mandate after expelling Saddam from Kuwait , and deftly managing the end of the cold war and the reunification of Germany loom ever larger . Given the mid-term reaction to the son 's inattention to alliances and to the details of postwar Iraq , it is clear that many Americans are nostalgic for the skills and sensibility the first President Bush brought to the Oval Office  --  a reversal of historical fortune that has come , sadly for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In terms of foreign policy , it is true that 41 was more a realist than an ideologue  --  the prose to Reagan 's cold-war poetry . And it is also true that the son would prefer to be remembered not as a second George Bush but as a second Gipper  --  a big , transformative president who confronted a mortal threat to the nation with steely soul and soaring words . Hence , it seems , the innate appeal of the neoconservative argument , advanced in part by Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney ( a 41 figure who got neocon religion after 9/11 ) , to strike Iraq in a noble bid to transform the Middle East . <p> In classical terms , the tragic figure is someone whose inherent flaws are evident from the beginning . In the wake of September 11 , we knew our president 's virtues . He was resolute , disdainful of dissent ; like his hero Winston Churchill , Bush dismissed critics he believes spin around with " the alacrity of squirrels . " But we also knew Bush 's vices . Resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism can breed isolation . <p> Hindsight , of course , is a luxury , and life often appears clearer in retrospect than it does at the time , in the arena . The bet Bush has made in the Middle East is a grand one , and history is made , and people are freed , by grand gambles . The American Founders gambled with Britain in 1776 ; Churchill gambled with Germany in 1940 ; Reagan gambled with the Soviet Union in the 1980s . The line between triumph and tragedy is a thin one , and things may yet work out . <p> Or so we must believe . Faith is important to the Bushes , always has been , and to return to the Bible the president knows so well , there is a New Testament verse familiar to patrician politicians from Theodore Roosevelt and his cousin Franklin to Prescott and George H.W. Bush : " To whom much is given , " the Scriptures say , " much is expected . " Much has been given to George W. Bush , and now , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in , he has been given another great gift : one more chance to set things right . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Jon Meacham <p>
