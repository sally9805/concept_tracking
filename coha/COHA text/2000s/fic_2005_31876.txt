Chapter One A Brief History of My Shortened Life It was not my fault . If only the group had followed my original itinerary without changing it hither , thither , and yon , this debacle would never have happened . But such was not the case , and there you have it , I regret to say . " Following the Buddha 's Footsteps " is what I named the expedition . It was to have begun in the southwestern corner of China , in Yunnan Province , with vistas of the Himalayas and perpetual spring flowers , and then to have continued south on the famed Burma Road . This would allow us to trace the marvelous influence of various religious cultures on Buddhist art over a thousand years and a thousand miles-a fabulous journey into the past . As if that were not enough appeal , I would be both tour leader and personal docent , making the expedition a truly value-added opportunity . But in the wee hours of December 2nd , and just fourteen days before we were to leave on our expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've finally said it , as unbelievable as it sounds . I can still see the tragic headline : " Socialite Butchered in Cult Slaying . " The article was quite long : two columns on the left-hand side of the front page , with a color photo of me covered with an antique textile , an exquisite one utterly ruined for future sale . The report was a terrible thing to read : " The body of Bibi Chen , 63 , retail maven , socialite , and board member of the Asian Art Museum , was found yesterday in the display window of her Union Square store , The Immortals , famed for its chinoiserie .... " That odious word- " chinoiserie " - so belittling in a precious way . The article continued with a rather nebulous description of the weapon : a small , rakelike object that had severed my throat , and a rope tightened around my neck , suggesting that someone had tried to strangle me after stabbing had failed . The door had been forced open , and bloody footprints of size-twelve men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then out the door , and down the street . Next to my body lay jewelry and broken figurines . According to one source , there was a paper with writing from a Satanic cult bragging that it had struck again . Two days later , there was another story , only shorter and with no photo : " New Clues in Arts Patron 's Death . " A police spokesman explained that they had never called it a cult slaying . The detective had noted " a paper , " meaning a newspaper tabloid , and when asked by reporters what the paper said , he gave the tabloid 's headline : " Satanic Cult Vows to Kill Again . " The spokesman went on to say that more evidence had been found and an arrest had been made . A police dog tracked the trail left by my blood . What is invisible to the human eye , the spokesman said , still contains " scent molecules that highly trained dogs can detect for as long as a week or so after the event . " ( My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an alleyway , where they found bloodstained slacks stuffed in a shopping cart filled with trash . A short distance from there , they found a tent fashioned out of blue tarp and cardboard . They arrested the occupant , a homeless man , who was wearing the shoes that had left the telltale imprints . The suspect had no criminal record but a history of psychiatric problems . Case solved . Or maybe not . Right after my friends were lost in Burma , the newspaper changed its mind again : " Shopkeeper 's Death Ruled Freak Accident . " No reason , no purpose , no one to blame , just " freak , " this ugly word next to my name forever . And why was I demoted to " shopkeeper " ? The story further noted that DNA analysis of the man 's skin particles and those on both the blood- spattered trousers and the shoes confirmed that the man was no longer a suspect . So who had entered my gallery and left the prints ? Was n't it an obvious case of crime ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no mention of a further investigation , shame on them . In the same article , the reporter noted " an odd coincidence , " namely that " Bibi Chen had organized the Burma Road trip , in which eleven people went on a journey to view Buddhist art and disappeared . " You see how they pointed the shaking finger of blame ? They certainly implied it , through slippery association with what could not be adequately explained , as if I had created a trip that was doomed from the start . Pure nonsense . The worst part about all of this is that I do n't remember how I died . In those last moments , what was I doing ? Whom did I see wielding the instrument of death ? Was it painful ? Perhaps it was so awful that I blocked it from my memory . It 's human nature to do that . And am I not still human , even if I 'm dead ? The autopsy concluded that I was not strangled but had drowned in my own blood . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information has been of any use whatsoever . A little rake in my throat , a rope around my neck-this was an accident ? You 'd have to be brainless to think so , as more than a few evidently were . At the postmortem , photos were taken , especially of the awful part of my neck . My body was tucked into a metal drawer for future study . There I lay for several days , and then samples of me were removed-a swab of this , a sliver of that , hair follicles , blood , and gastric juices . Then two more days went by , because the chief medical examiner went on vacation in Maui , and since I was an illustrious person , of particular renown in the art world-and no , not just the retail community , as the San Francisco Chronicle suggested-he wanted to see me personally , as did esteemed people in the professions of crime and forensic medicine . They dropped by on their lunch hour to make ghoulish guesses as to what had happened to cause my premature demise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out , and said brutish things about the contents of my stomach , the integrity of the vessels in my brain , my personal habits , and past records of my health , some being rather indelicate matters one would rather not hear discussed so openly among strangers eating their sack lunches . In that refrigerated land , I thought I had fallen into the underworld , truly I did . The most dejected people were there-an angry woman who had dashed across Van Ness Avenue to scare her boyfriend , a young man who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and changed his mind halfway down , an alcoholic war vet who had passed out on a nude beach . Tragedies , mortal embarrassments , unhappy endings , all of them . But why was I there ? I was stuck in these thoughts , unable to leave my breathless body , until I realized that my breath was not gone but surrounding me , buoying me upward . It was quite amazing , really-every single breath , the sustenance I took and expelled out of both habit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And everyone else 's as well , it seemed , inhalations of hopes , exhalations of disappointment . Anger , love , pleasure , hate-they were all there , the bursts , puffs , sighs , and screams . The air I had breathed , I now knew , was composed not of gases but of the density and perfume of emotions . The body had been merely a filter , a censor . I knew this at once , without question , and I found myself released , free to feel and do whatever I pleased . That was the advantage of being dead : no fear of future consequences . Or so I thought . When the funeral finally happened on December 11th , it was nearly ten days after I died , and without preservation I would have been compost . Nonetheless , many came to see and mourn me . A modest guess would be , oh , eight hundred , though I am not strictly counting . To begin , there was my Yorkshire terrier , Poochini , in the front row , prostrate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beside him was my good friend Harry Bailley , giving him the occasional piece of desiccated liver . Harry had offered to adopt Poochini , and my executor readily agreed , since Harry is , as everyone knows , that famous British dog trainer on television . Perhaps you 've seen his show-The Fido Files ? Number-one ratings , and many , many Emmy Awards . Lucky little Poochini . And the mayor came-did I mention ? - and stayed at least ten minutes , which may not sound long , but he goes to many places in a day and spends far less time at most . The board members and staff of the Asian Art Museum also came to pay respects , nearly all of them , as did the docents I trained , years ' and years ' worth , plus the people who had signed up for the Burma Road trip . There were also my three tenants-the troublesome one , as well-and my darling repeat customers and the daily browsers , plus Roger , my FedEx man ; Thieu , my Vietnamese manicurist ; Luc , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most surprising to say , Najib , the Lebanese grocer from my corner market on Russian Hill , who called me " dearie " for twenty-seven years but never gave me a discount , not even when the fruit had gone overripe . By the way , I am not mentioning people in any order of importance . This is simply how it is coming to me . Now that I think of it , I would estimate that more than eight hundred people were there . The auditorium at the de Young Museum was crowded beyond belief , and hundreds spilled into the halls , where closed-circuit television monitors beamed the unhappy proceedings . It was a Monday morning , when the museum was usually closed , but a number of out-of-towners on Tea Garden Drive saw the funeral as a fine opportunity to sneak into the current exhibit , Silk Road Treasures from the Aurel Stein Expeditions , a testimony , in my opinion , to British Imperial plundering at the height of cupidity . When guards turned the interlopers away from the exhibits , they wandered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various obituaries that lay next to the guest book . Most of the papers gave the same hodgepodge of facts : " Born in Shanghai ... Fled China with her family as a young girl in 1949 ... An alumna of Mills College and guest lecturer there , in art history ... Proprietor of The Immortals ... Board member of many organizations ... " Then came a long list of worthy causes for which I was described as a devoted and generous donor : this league and that society , for Asian seniors and Chinese orphans , for the poor , the ill , and the disabled , for the abused , the illiterate , the hungry , and the mentally ill . There was an account of my delight in the arts and the substantial amounts I had given to fund artist colonies , the Youth Orchestra with the San Francisco Symphony , and the Asian Art Museum-the major recipient of my lagniappes and largesse , before and after death-which enthusiastically offered the unusual venue for my funeral , the de Young , in which the Asian was housed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bursting with pride . Instead , it struck me as nonsensical . I heard a roar of voices coming from every bit of chatter from every dinner , luncheon , and gala I had ever attended . I saw a blur of names in thick , glossy programs , my own displayed in " Archangels , " below those in the fewer-numbered and more favored " Inner Sanctum , " to which that Yang boy , the Stanford dropout , always seemed to belong . Nothing filled me with the satisfaction I believed I would have at the end of my life . I could not say to myself : " That is where I was most special , where I was most important , and that is enough for a lifetime . " I felt like a rich vagabond who had passed through the world , paving my way with gold fairy dust , then realizing too late that the path disintegrated as soon as I passed over it . As to whom I had left behind , the obituary said , " There are no survivors , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was sadly true , all my family was gone-my father , of a heart attack ; one brother , of alcoholic cirrhosis , although I was not supposed to mention that ; the other brother a victim of a road-rage accident ; and my mother , who passed from life before I could know her . I do n't count my stepmother , Sweet Ma , who is still alive , but the less said about her the better . The choice of an open-casket ceremony was my fault , the result of an unfortunate aside I had made to a group of friends at a tea-tasting party I had hosted at my gallery . You see , I had recently received a ship 's container of fantastic items that I had found in the countryside of Hubei Province . Among them was a two- hundred-year-old lacquered coffin of paulownia wood made by a eunuch singer who had performed in palace theatricals . In death , most eunuchs , except those in the upper echelons of service , were given only the most perfunctory of burials , without ceremony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit tablets in the temples . In yesteryears , people rich and poor prepared for the netherworld by making their coffins long before they ceased to hear the cock crowing the new day , and the fact that this eunuch was allowed to make such a grand coffin suggested that he was someone 's pet-the prettier boys often were . Alas , this adored eunuch drowned while fishing along the Yangtze , and his body went sailing without a boat , swept away to oblivion . The eunuch 's parents , in Longgang Township , to whom his possessions had been sent , faithfully kept the coffin in a shed , in hopes that their son 's wayward corpse would one day return . The subsequent generations of this family grew impoverished by a combination of drought , extortion , and too many gifts to opera singers , all of which led to their losing face and their property . Years went by , and the new landowners would not go near the shed with the coffin , which was reputed to be haunted by a vampire eunuch . Derelict with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds , the mud of floods , and the dust of time . Then , when a newly rich farmer started construction of a miniature golf course to adjoin his family 's two-story Swiss-style villa , the shed was unearthed . Amazingly , the coffin had only superficial rot and not much cracking from shrinkage ; such is the quality of paulownia , which , though lightweight , is more durable than many harder woods . The exterior had more than fifty coats of black lacquer , as did its short four-legged stand . Beneath the grime , one could see that the lacquer bore whimsically painted carvings of sprites and gods and mythical beasts , as well as other magical motifs , and these were continued on the interior lid of the coffin as well . My favorite detail was a playful Tibetan spaniel on the portion of the lid that would have been opposite the corpse 's face . Having been protected from sunlight , the interior art on the lid was still exquisitely colored against the black lacquer . Neat bundles of paper lined the bottom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended tenant of the coffin and the same man 's unpublished poems , tributes to nature , beauty , and-most intriguing-romantic love for a lady from her youth through premature death . Well , I presume it was a lady , though one never knows with some Chinese names , does one ? The coffin contained two other objects : a smaller lacquer urn with the name of the eunuch 's dog , the Tibetan spaniel , and a small ivory-rimmed box in which three calcified peas rattled about , said to be the eunuch 's manhood and its two accompaniments . I could immediately see the coffin was both a millstone and a treasure . I had a few clients-people in the film industry-who might have liked this sort of odd decorative piece , particularly if it still held the petrified peas . But the proportions were awkward . The top extended beyond the length of the coffin like the duck-billed prow of a ship . And it was monstrously heavy . I asked the farmer to name his price , and he spit out a number that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ridiculous , " I said , and started to leave . " Hey , hey , hey ! " he shouted , and I turned back and uttered a sum that was one-third his initial offer . He doubled that , and I retorted that if he was so enamored of a dead man 's house , he should keep it . I then split the difference and said I wanted the infernal box only to store some surplus items I had bought , after which I would chop up the coffin for firewood . " It has lots of room for storage , " the farmer boasted , and upped the ante a wee bit . I heaved the biggest sigh I could muster , then countered that he should make arrangements for his men to deliver it to Wuhan harbor for shipment with the rest of my brilliant bargains . Done ! Voila tout ! Back in San Francisco , once the coffin arrived , I put it in the back room of my shop and did indeed use it to store antique textiles woven by Hmong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had guests over for the tea-tasting . We were sampling different pu-erh tuo cha-which is , by the way , the only tea that improves over time ; anything else , after six months , you may as well use for kitty-cat litter . With the fifth tasting round , we had come to the gold standard of aged teas , a twenty-year-old vintage of the aptly named " camel breath " variety , which is especially pungent but excellent for lowering cholesterol and extending the life span . " But should I die sooner than later , " I jokingly said , " then this " - and I patted the enormous funerary box- " this magnificent vessel to the afterworld , the Cadillac of coffins , is what I wish to be buried in , and with the top raised at my funeral so that all can admire the interior artistry as well .... " ( Continues ... )
