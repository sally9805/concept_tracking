Early winter in modern-day America It was sheer stubbornness keeping Mary Sutter alive now . She still had something she needed to say , and she refused to give in to the lure of death until she was done giving her instructions to her sister , Grace . Grace sat by the hospital bed , her eyes swollen with unshed tears and her heart breaking as she watched Mary struggle to speak . The gentle beeps and soft hums were gone ; the countless medical machines monitoring her decline had been removed just an hour ago . A pregnant stillness had settled over the room in their stead . Grace sat in painful silence , willing her sister to live . The phone call telling Grace of the automobile accident had come at noon yesterday . By the time she had arrived at the hospital , Mary 's child had already been born , taken from his mother by emergency surgery . And by six this morning , the doctors had finally conceded that her sister was dying . Younger by three years , Mary had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . She 'd also been the bossier of the two girls . By the time she was five , Mary had been ruling the Sutter household by imposing her will on their aging parents , her older half brothers still living at home , and Grace . And when their parents had died nine years ago in a boating accident , it had been eighteen-year-old Mary who had handled the tragedy . Their six half brothers had come home from all four corners of the world , only to be told their only chore was that of pallbearers to their father and stepmother . After the beautiful but painful ceremony , the six brothers had returned to their families and jobs , Grace had gone back to Boston to finish her doctorate in mathematical physics , and Mary had stayed in Pine Creek , Maine , claiming the aged Sutter homestead as her own . Which was why , when Mary had shown up on her doorstep in Norfolk , Virginia , four months ago , Grace had been truly surprised . It would take something mighty powerful to roust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Mary only had to take off her jacket for Grace to understand . Her sister was pregnant . Mary was just beginning to show when she had arrived , and it was immediately obvious to Grace that her sister did n't know what to do about the situation . They 'd had several discussions over the last four months , some of them heated . But Mary , being the stubborn woman she was , refused to talk about the problem with Grace . She was there to gather her thoughts and her courage and decide what to do . Yes , she loved the baby 's father more than life itself , but no , she was n't sure she could marry him . Was he married to someone else ? Grace had wanted to know . No . Did he live in the city , then ? She 'd have to move ? No . Was he a convicted felon ? Of course not . For the life of her , Grace could not get her sister to tell her why she could n't go home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary would n't even tell her the man 's name . She was closed-mouthed about everything except for the fact that he was a Scot and that he had arrived in Pine Creek just last year . They had met at a grange supper and had fallen madly in love over the next three months . She 'd gotten pregnant the first time they made love . It was another four months of bliss , and then Mary 's world had suddenly careened out of control . In the quiet evening hours during a walk one day , the Scot had told her a fantastical tale ( Mary 's words ) , and then he had asked her to marry him . Two days later Mary had arrived at Grace 's home in Virginia . And for the last four months , Grace had asked Mary to reveal what the Scot had told her , but her sister had remained silent and brooding . Until she had announced yesterday , out of the blue and with a promise to explain everything later , that she was returning to Pine Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone call came . Mary had not even made it out of the city when her car had been pushed into the opposite lane of a six-lane highway by a drunk driver . It had taken the rescue team three hours to free Mary from what was left of her rental car . And now she was dying . And her new baby son was just down the hall , surprisingly healthy for having been pulled from the sanctuary of his mother 's womb a whole month early . A nurse entered the room and checked the IV hooked up to Mary , then left just as silently , leaving Grace with only a sympathetic smile and a whisper that Grace should let her know if she needed anything . Grace rushed to follow her out the door . " Can she see the baby ? " Grace asked the nurse . " Can she hold him ? " The nurse contemplated the request for only a second . Her motherly face suddenly brightened . " I think I can arrange it , " she said , nodding her approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby in his mother 's arms as soon as possible . " She laid a gentle hand on Grace 's shoulder . " I 'm sorry , Miss Sutter , for what 's happening here . But the accident did a lot of damage to your sister , and the emergency cesarean complicated things . Your sister 's spleen was severely ruptured , and now her organs are shutting down one at a time . She just is n't responding to anything we try . It 's a wonder she 's even conscious . " The nurse leaned in and said in a whisper , as if they were in church , " They 're calling him the miracle baby , you know . Not one scratch on his beautiful little body . And he 's not even needing an incubator , although they have him in one as a precaution . " Grace smiled back , but it was forced . " Please bring Mary her son , " she said . " It 's important she sees that he 's okay . She 's been asking about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find Mary awake . Her sister 's sunken blue gaze followed her as she rounded the bed and sat down beside her again . " I want a promise , " Mary said in a labored whisper . Grace carefully picked up Mary 's IV-entangled hand and held it . " Anything , " she told her , giving her fingers a gentle squeeze . " Just name it . " Mary smiled weakly . " Now I know I 'm dying , " she said , trying to squeeze back . " You were eight the last time you promised me anything without knowing the facts first . " Grace made a production of rolling her eyes at her sister , not letting her see how much that one simple word , dying , wounded her heart . She did n't want her sister to die . She wanted to go back just two days , to when they were arguing the way sisters did when they loved each other . " And I 'll probably regret this promise just as much , " Grace told her with false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you probably will . " " Tell me , " she told her sister . " I want you to promise to take my baby home to his father . " Grace was stunned . She was expecting Mary to ask her to raise her son , not give him away . " Take him to his father ? " Grace repeated , slowly shaking her head . " The same man you ran away from four months ago ? " Mary weakly tightened her grip on Grace 's hand . " I was running back to him yesterday , " she reminded her . " I 'm not making any promises until you tell me why you left Pine Creek in the first place . And what made you decide to return , " Grace told her . " Tell me what scared you badly enough to leave . " Mary stared blankly at nothing , and for a moment Grace was afraid she had lost consciousness . Mary 's breathing came in short , shallow breaths that were slowly growing more labored . Her eyelids were heavy , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen on deaf ears . But then Mary quietly began to speak . " He scared me , " she said . " When he told me his story , he scared the daylights out of me . " " What story ? " Grace asked , reaching for Mary 's hand again . " What did he tell you ? " Mary 's eyes suddenly brightened with a spark of mischief . " Lift my bed , " she instructed . " I want to see the look on your face , my scientist sister , when you hear what he told me . " Grace pushed the bed 's lift button and watched her sister sit up . Mary never called her a scientist unless she had some outrageous idea she wanted to convince her was possible . Grace was the rocket scientist , Mary was the dreamer . " Okay . Out with it , " she demanded , seizing on that one little spark like a lifeline . She settled a pillow behind Mary 's head . " What did lover boy tell you that made you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Finally . The man has a name . Michael what ? " Mary did n't answer . She was already focused on gathering her words as she stared off into space over Grace 's right shoulder . " He moved to Pine Creek from Nova Scotia , " Mary said . " And before that he lived in Scotland . " She turned her gaze to Grace , her drug-dilated , blue eyes suddenly looking apprehensive . " He told me he was born in Scotland . " And then , in a near whisper , she added , " In the year 1171 . " Grace straightened in her chair and stared at Mary . " What ? " she whispered back , convinced she had heard wrong . " When ? " " In 1171 . " " You 're meaning in November of 1971 , right ? " Mary slowly shook her head . " No . The year eleven hundred seventy-one . Eight hundred years ago . " Grace thought about that . Fantastical was putting it mildly . But then she suddenly laughed softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he believes in reincarnation ? " She waved her hand in the air . " Heck , half the population of the world believes they 've led past lives . There are whole religions based on reincarnation . " " No , " Mary insisted , shaking her head . " That 's not what Michael meant . He says he spent the first twenty-five years of his life in twelfth-century Scotland and the last four years here in modern-day North America . That a storm carried him through time . " Grace was at a loss for words . " Actually , " Mary continued , " five of his clan and their warhorses came with him . " Grace sucked in her breath at the sorrow in her sister 's eyes . " And where are these men now ? And their ... their ... horses ? " " They 're dead , " Mary said . " All of them . Michael 's the last of his clan . " Her features suddenly relaxed . " Except for his son now . " She reached for Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I was going back . Family is important to Michael . He 's all alone in this world , except for our baby . And that 's why you have to take his son to him . " Mary let out a tired breath . " I 'm dying . " She looked at Grace with sadly resigned eyes . " You have to do this for me , Gracie . And you have to tell Michael I love him . " Tears were spilling over her cheeks . Grace stared down at her sister through tears of her own . " Will you listen to yourself , Mare ? You 're asking me to take your son to a madman . If he really believes he 's traveled through time , then he 's touched in the head . You want him bringing up your child ? " Mary released a shuddering breath and closed her eyes again . A stillness settled over the room once more . Mary was asking her to take a child  --  her nephew  --  to a man who was not sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could Mary ask such a thing of her ? And how could she not grant her sister 's dying wish ? The door opened again with a muted whoosh , and Grace looked up to see a clear plastic basinet being wheeled into the room . White cotton-covered little arms waved in the air , the sleeves so long there was no sign of the tiny hands that should be sticking out of the ends . Grace had to wipe the tears from her eyes to see that Mary was awake again , straining to see her baby . " Oh , God . Look at him , Gracie , " Mary whispered , reaching toward him with a shaking hand . " He 's so tiny . " The nurse placed the basinet next to the bed . She put a pillow on Mary 's lap and carefully placed Mary 's cast-covered right arm on top of it . Then she picked up the tiny , squeaking bundle from the basinet and gently settled him on the pillow in Mary 's lap . " He 's so pink , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so beautiful . " " He 's thinking it 's dinnertime , " the nurse said . " You might as well feed him a bit of sugar water if you feel up to it . " " Oh , yes , " Mary said , already tugging at his blanket . The nurse repositioned him in the crook of Mary 's broken arm and handed her a tiny bottle of clear liquid with a nipple on it . The tubes sticking in Mary 's left hand tangled in her child 's kicking feet . The nurse moved around the bed , handed the bottle to Grace , and carefully removed the IV from Mary 's hand , covering it with a bandage she pulled from her smock . " There . You do n't really need this , " she said , hanging the tubes on the IV stand . She took the bottle of sugar water back and stuck it in the fretting baby 's mouth . Free now , Mary awkwardly but eagerly took over . The nurse watched for a minute , making sure Mary could handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to leave you in privacy , " the nurse said , her eyes betraying her sadness as she smiled at Mary and her son . She looked back at Grace . " Just ring for me if you need anything . I 'll come immediately . " Panic immobilized Grace . The nurse was leaving them alone ? Neither one of them knew a thing about babies . " Look , Gracie . Is n't he beautiful ? " Mary asked . Grace stood up and examined her nephew . Beautiful ? He was unquestionably the homeliest baby she had ever seen . His puffy cheeks were red with exertion , his eyes were scrunched closed , his chin and neck blended into a series of overlapping wrinkles , and gobs of dark straight hair shot out from under a bright blue knit cap . " He 's gorgeous , " she told Mary . " Pull off his cap , " her sister asked . " I want to see his hair . " Grace gently eased off her nephew 's cap but was immediately tempted to slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears popped out a good inch from his head , pushing his now freed hair into frenzied spikes . He looked like a troll . " Is n't he beautiful ? " Mary repeated . " He 's gorgeous , " Grace reconfirmed , trying with all her might to see her nephew the way her sister did . Mary was the animal lover in the Sutter household and was forever dragging home scruffy kittens , wounded birds and chipmunks , and mangy dogs . It was no wonder Mary thought her little son was precious . He was . Homely , but precious . " Let 's undress him , " Mary said . " Help me count his fingers and toes . " Startled , Grace looked at her sister . " Count them ? Why ? Do you think he 's missing some ? " Mary gave a weak laugh as she wiped her son 's mouth with the edge of his blanket . " Of course not . That 's just what new mothers do . " Grace decided to humor her sister . Gingerly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny nightshirt . It was a difficult task as the baby , now happy with a full belly , kept kicking his legs as he mouthed giant bubbles from his pursed lips . Finally , with her two good hands and Mary 's unsteady uninjured one , they freed his legs . Grace held up first one foot and then the other and counted his toes out loud . She counted them again . Twelve . Six on each tiny foot . Mary gave a weak shriek of joy . At least , it sounded joyful . Grace stared at her numbly . " Gifts from his daddy , " Mary said in a winded whisper . " Michael has six toes on each foot . " And this was a joyful thing ? Grace wanted to ask . Being deformed was good ? " Pull his shirt and diaper off , " Mary said then . " I want to see him naked . " Grace was afraid to . What other surprises was the clothing hiding ? But she did as her sister asked , even though she feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what she was doing . Heck , she had n't even played with dolls when she was a kid . She had hiked and fished with her father until she was eight , until one of her older brothers had brought home a biography of Albert Einstein and she had discovered the world of science . From then on it was telescopes , science books , and mathematical formulas written on chalkboards . Grace took off the baby 's nightshirt and peeled off the diaper . She gasped and quickly covered him back up . Mary pulled the diaper completely off . " You 're a prude , Gracie , " Mary said , cupping her baby 's bottom . " He 's supposed to look like that . He 'll grow into it . " Mary traced the outline of his face , then possessively rubbed her fingers over his entire body . " Get a new diaper before we get sprayed , " she said . Grace quickly complied . And between the two of them and their three hands , they eventually got him changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strings at his feet when she noticed a tear fall onto her hand . She stopped and looked up to find Mary silently crying as she stared down at her son . " What 's the matter , Mare ? Are you in pain ? " she asked , holding the baby 's feet so they could n't kick out and hurt her . Mary slowly shook her head , never taking her eyes off her son as she ran a finger over his cheek again . " I want to see him grow up , " she whispered in a voice that was growing more fatigued , more faint , by the minute . She looked at Grace . " I want to be there for him when he falls and skins his knee , catches his first snake , kisses his first girl , and gets his heart broken every other day . " Grace flinched as if she 'd been struck . She closed her eyes against the pain that welled up in her throat , forcing herself not to cry . Mary reached up and rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had done to her son 's . " So it 's up to you , Gracie . You have to be there for him , for me . Take him to his daddy , and be there for both of them . Promise me ? " " He 's not sane , Mary . He thinks he traveled through time . " Mary looked back at her son . " Maybe he did . " Grace wanted to scream . Were the drugs in her sister 's body clouding her judgment ? Was she so fatigued , so mentally weakened , that she did n't realize what she was asking ? " Mary , " she said , taking her sister by the chin and making her look at her . " People ca n't travel through time . " " I do n't care if he came from Mars , Gracie . I love him . And he will love our son more than anyone else can . They need each other , and I need your promise to bring them together . " Grace walked away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grant such a promise . She did n't know a thing about babies , but she was intelligent and financially stable . How hard could it be to raise one little boy ? She could read books on child-rearing and promise him a good life with lots of love and attention . She had never met this Michael the Scot , and she sure as heck did n't like what she did know about him . But then , she was even more reluctant to deny Mary her wish . This was the first time her sister had ever asked anything of her , and she was torn between her love for Mary and her worry for her nephew . " Come get in bed with us , Gracie , " Mary said . " Just like we used to . " Grace turned around to find Mary with her eyes closed and her child clutched tightly to her chest . The infant was sleeping . Grace returned to the bed and quickly lowered it . Without hesitation she kicked off her shoes , lowered the side bar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Ummm . This is nice , " Mary murmured , not opening her eyes . " When was the last time we shared a bed ? " " Mom and Dad 's funeral , " Grace reminded her . She laid her hand on the baby 's backside which was sticking up in the air . " Do n't you think we should give this guy a name ? " she asked , rubbing his back . " No . That 's Michael 's privilege , " Mary said . " Until then , just call him Baby . " " Baby what ? You did n't tell me his father 's last name . " " It 's MacBain . Michael MacBain . He bought the Bigelow Christmas Tree Farm . " That was news to Grace . " What happened to John and Ellen Bigelow ? " " They still live there . Michael moved in with them , " Mary said , her voice growing distant . She turned and looked at Grace , her once beautiful , vibrant blue eyes now glazed with lackluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As solid as a rock , " she said , closing her eyes again . Except he believes he 's eight hundred years old , Grace thought . She moved her hand from her nephew 's bottom to her sister 's hair , brushing it away from her forehead . " I 'm still waiting for your promise , " Mary said , turning her face into Grace 's palm . Grace took a deep breath and finally spoke the words she had so stubbornly , and maybe selfishly , been avoiding . " I promise , Mare . I 'll take your son to Michael MacBain . " Mary kissed Grace 's palm and sighed deeply , settling comfortably closer . " And you 'll scatter my ashes on TarStone Mountain , " she said then , her voice trailing off to a whisper . " On Summer Solstice morning . " " On ... on Summer Solstice . I promise . " Grace left one hand cupping Mary 's head and the other one cradling Baby as a patient , gentle peace returned to the room . Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling the weakening drum of life beneath her tear-dampened cheek . In two hours it was over , without the pain of a struggle . Mary 's heart simply stopped beating . The only sound that remained was the soft , gentle breathing of a sleeping baby .
