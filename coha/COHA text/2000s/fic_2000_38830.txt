WE REACH HIM TOO LATE , pulling him out of the curing pond , nothing left but a melted body and a pain-twisted face . For a moment or two , we talk about the dead expeditor , how he was good and why he was n't perfect , and why he killed himself - because he was imperfect , but noble is why . Then we wash his face and kiss him , as is customary , and I deliver the body to Scrap . <p> Our plant manager needs a report , but she does n't want stories of another suicide . She tells me that she does n't . So I describe it as an accident , another misstep from the high corundum mesh , and maybe we should repair those railings during the next down cycle . But she does n't want to hear that , either . " No cycles but up . " She is delivering a threat . " We 're too far behind as it is , Jusk . " <p> I nod . I smile . Then I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n <p> " Three shifts , " she warns . Which means ten shifts , or more . Then she gives me a hard stare , eyes and silence informing me that it would be so lovely if this little problem vanished on its own . <p> I step outside . <p> Traffic is scarce in the main corridor . I walk exactly as far as I can without leaving home , waving at the passing birth wagons until one pulls off . The driver shows me his cargo , but only one of the newborn is large enough to do the job . I ask what it will take for that big one to be lost during delivery , and the driver says , " I ca n't . " He says , " That 's a special rush order , that one . " <p> A lie , most likely . <p> " Wait , " I tell him . Igo inside , then return with a piece of raw Memory . Memory has no color and very little mass , and of course it is incomplete . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's ever traded . Laying it flush against his forehead , the driver sighs and grows an erection , then says , " Deal . " It 's the Memory of one of His long-ago lovers - a popular commodity . The driver is even willing to help carry the newborn through the closest door , he 's so eager . Then I give him a look , asking where he got that Memory . <p> " I found it , " he says . " I do n't remember where . " <p> " Good , " I say . <p> My crew is at work . Standing in the main aisle , I can see our entire line - bug ovens and the furnace ; the curing pond and finishers - and I see the tiny faces that look over at me , curious and eager . <p> " Keep working , " I tell them . Then , " Thank you . " <p> With laser shears , I cut the newborn out of its sack . It 's a big worker , all right : shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfold the long , long limbs , then engage its systems . There 's no way to be certain what job it is meant to do , but anyone can be anything , if needed . All that matters is that we serve Him . <p> I kick the newborn in its smooth crotch . <p> With a flutter , its eyes open , absorbing light for the first time . <p> " My name is Jusk , " I tell it . " I 'm your superior . This is my right hand . Shake it with your right hand , please . " <p> It obeys , without hesitation . <p> " Stand , " I say . Then after it succeeds , on its first attempt , I tell it , " Walk with me . This is your introductory tour . Pay close attention . " <p> " I shall . " <p> " What is my name ? " <p> " Jusk . " <p> " On your left is a stack of crates . Look at them . And now look at me . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " What are the dimensions of the third-largest crate ? " <p> " Point one by point one by point four standard . " <p> " Now , without looking , tell me the serial number on the top crate . " The newborn recites twenty-three digits before I lift my hand , stopping it . <p> " Good , " I say . " You 're integrating nicely . " <p> The mouth ca n't yet smile , but I sense pleasure . Pride . " What do you make here ? " my new expeditor inquires . <p> " Bone . " <p> Its eyes are simple black discs , yet by some trick of the light , they seem astonished . Or disappointed , perhaps . <p> " It 's not a glamorous product , " I concede , " but bone is vital . " What would He be without a skeleton ? Without His handsome , most perfect shape ? " You 'll be my expeditor . That 's a critical job . Before you begin , you 'll need to find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . " <p> It nods . <p> " Culture a sense of self , " I advise . " My strongest workers have the strongest identities . " <p> It says nothing . <p> " You 'll find everything you need in Personnel . Mock-flesh . Eyes . Everything . " I watch it for a moment , then add , " Most of us pattern ourselves after someone from His past . A trusted friend , a ) over . Whomever . just as long as it honors Him . " <p> The newborn is a head taller than 1 , and strongly built . Simple eyes gaze at my face . At my workers . Everywhere . Then it speaks quietly , warning me , " I 'm not supposed to be here . I was intended for another duty . " <p> " Except you 're needed here . " I have given these tours to more than a hundred newborns , and none has ever acted disappointed . " Come with me , " I tell it . " I want to show you something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corundum mesh . The ceiling and distant floor are polished diamond , smooth and lovely , and the walls are a rougher diamond , catching and throwing the light . I point to Personnel , then the back doorway leading to the warehouse , and I name each of the five assembly lines . Every line has its own bug oven , squat and rectangular , the exteriors plated with gold . <p> " You 're my expeditor , " I promise . " You 'll feed my oven whatever raw materials it needs . " <p> " Your expeditor , " it repeats . <p> " Once you 've got your name and face , visit the warehouse . Ask for Old Nicka . He 'll show you what else you need to know . " <p> " How big is this place ? " <p> " Huge , is n't it ? " I love this view . I always have . " It 's nearly five thousand standards long , from Assembly to Shipping . " <p> " Yet this is all so tiny , " my expeditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I look at the faceless face , uncertain how to respond . <p> " How many workers ? " it asks . <p> " Including you and me , five hundred and eleven . " <p> " And who am I replacing ? " <p> Newborns never ask that question . They 're too grateful to be alive , and the prospect of anything else should be unimaginable . <p> " Was it a suicide ? " I hear . <p> " No . An accident . " <p> Beyond the eyes is doubt . Clear and undeniable doubt . <p> " Why bring up suicide ? " I have to ask . <p> The tiny , simple mouth seems to almost smile . " I must have overheard something . I 'm sorry . " <p> New ears might have heard one of my people whispering , yes . <p> " We run a careful clean shop here , " I warn it . <p> Softly , very softly , it says , " Due . " <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes Due against its own bright chest , in His language . " That is me . " <p> " Fine , " I allow . <p> Gazing down at my home , and his , Due tells me , " It 's surprising . You only make bone , but look how beautiful this is .... <p> As if it should be anything else , I think . <p> " I think I 'll stay , " proclaims Due . <p> As if any of us , in any large way , has the burden of choice . <p> AGES AGO , WHEN the construction teams were erecting our plant , there were plans to include a large chapel where we would have worshipped Him in our spare moments . It would have been a glorious chamber filled with inspiring Memories free for the touching , plus likenesses of His family and trusted followers . But according to legend , a sudden decree put an end to that indulgence . Instead of a chapel , the workers were told to build a fifth assembly line , increasing the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every existing chapel inside older plants were to be converted immediately , their space dedicated to making more of whatever those plants produced . <p> Time is critical , the decree tells US . <p> Maybe not with its words , but in the meaning that the words carry between them . <p> Hurry , He calls to us . Hurry . <p> " That new man - " <p> " Due ? " <p> " Gorgeous . " Mollene giggles , dancing around her work station . " I just wish he 'd notice little me ! " <p> Nothing on or about Mollene is little . <p> " So he found himself a pretty face , " I say . <p> " Not pretty , " she warns . " Gorgeous . The whole package is . Handsome and strong ... but not too strong ... <p> " Which means ? " <p> " He 's delicious , " she purrs , and that from a woman who has tasted more than a few . " Am I right , Tannie ? Tell him I 'm right ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are old , nearly as old as this plant , and while they 're both durable , it 's a durability built in different ways . Tannie is small , quiet and glum , not prone to courage or her partner 's hyperbole . Yet even she admits , " He 's one of the most beautiful creatures that I 've ever seen . " <p> " I told you , Jusk ! " cackles Mollene . <p> " You did . You did . " <p> The women are a good team . A great team , even . When I was made line foreman , I had an inspiration , putting them together at the bug oven 's mouth . It takes good hands and balance to handle the freshly made bone , and it takes experience . And nearly two thousand shifts have passed since my inspiration . Much has gone wrong on the line , but nobody 's better than Mollene and Tannie when it comes to giving our bone its first look and delicate touch . <p> " A glorious , gorgeous man , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You like to have your looks at me . Do n't you , Jusk ? " <p> Her mock-flesh is old and often-patched . The knees and elbows are worn thin , a band of softness encircles her waist , and her big strong confident hands are shiny where the real Mollene peeks through . Yet even still , she is spectacular . Broad thighs and hips serve to carry her central features - two jungles of shaggy black mock-hair , and between the jungles , a pair of enormous , endlessly vigorous breasts complete with fat nipples that she paints a shouting red at the start of every shift . <p> " I love looking at you , " I tell the magnificent woman . <p> She giggles , and in thanks , gives me a few good bounces . <p> As I recall , Mollene fashioned herself around the partial Memory of an early love-an insatiable older woman from His long-ago youth . By contrast , Tannie based herself on the wife of one of His current deputies - the kind of woman who has said perhaps five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But of course everyone is important to Him . <p> He treasures every face , no matter how small the person behind it . <p> As I think , a sheet of hot white bone emerges from the oven , built of fibers and resins and a maze of finger-thick pores . Together , in a single motion , the women lift the bone and place it gently , gently onto the aerogel belt . It looks like perfect bone , at first glance . Mollene lifts a laser pen , ready to sign her name where it wo n't be too obvious . Every worker does it ; a signature is a harmless way to leave a trace of yourself . But she pauses , noticing several coagulated masses of bugs clinging to the far side . To Tannie 's side . Each mass looks like a drop of honey - a gooey golden substance that I 've seen only in His memories - but unlike honey , the clusters are hard as jewels , and in a glancing fashion , alive . <p> " How 's the bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the bugs . Sometimes they 're just stragglers , and the bone beneath is fine . Is perfect . " It looks all right , " says the old woman . But then she touches it , and shudders , jerking back her hand in pain . <p> " What is it ? " I ask . <p> Tannie cradles the hand with its mate , her tiny brown eyes staring off into the distance . " The bone 's bad , " she says . " Something 's wrong ... in the oven ... " <p> Mollene curses enough for three people , and with a relentless strength , she jerks that sheet of bone off the belt , getting beneath it and carrying it to the pallet where she 's been stacking Scrap , her substantial ass jiggling in time to her quick steps . <p> I take her place , for the moment . <p> The next bone is even worse . instead of a seamless snowy white , it 's a pissy yellow , and the pores are more like out-and-out holes . Something 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news , of course . Our plant is more than ten thousand shifts old , and over time these bugs acquire mutations . Subtle failures of control . And a nasty tendency toward laziness . <p> With an iridium hammer , I smack the emergency kill switch . <p> Diamond chains and matching gears come to a grudging halt . <p> What next ? I wonder . <p> Maintenance should be told - that 's policy - but Maintenance means slow solutions and acidic , accusing questions . <p> Hanging beside the oven area suit and helmet and boots . Each is made from antigen-free mock-bone . That 's how we fool the oven and its bugs . And they have to be footed , or they 'll assume that an intruder is just another raw material - a collection of soulless atoms waiting to be gnawed to nothingness , one atom at a time . <p> Bugs ca n't recognize a helping hand . <p> They 're stupid , and dangerous , and I despise them . <p> Mollene returns while I 'm dressing . With her voice and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful . " <p> You do n't rise to foreman without knowing caution , at least now and then . <p> The oven doors are gold-faced bone , heavy and slick . The chamber beyond is furiously hot and singing with bugs . Most of the mindless bastards are too small to see . Bristling with jointed arms and buckytube mouths , they build perfect fibers of proteins and plastics , ceramics and shape-memory metals . Other bugs , larger by a thousandfold , knit the fibers together . Then the largest few extrude the resins that finish the bone , creating a simple perfect and wondrously strong skeleton worthy of Him . <p> Duty grabs me , forcing me deeper into the oven . <p> The closest sheet of new bone is gray-black and brittle , its comer shattering with a touch of my gloved hand . <p> I crawl beneath the bone , then look up . <p> Clinging to the oven 's ceiling , to one of the oven 's bug-wombs , is some sort of phage , round and jeweled with spikes and sucking mouth parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one hand . But as I grab the phage , it strikes back , a stream of brownish fluid rolling thick down my arm , making it taste wrong . Making it seem dangerous . <p> The oven panics , marshaling every defense against the intruder . My arm is the intruder . <p> I wrench the phage loose , then I 'm running in a cowardly stoop , fleeing across a dozen standards of tangled and rasping bug heaven . <p> My suit is pierced . A burning begins on my hand and forearm , then the pain falls to nothing in the most terrible way . Glancing down , I see a ragged stump that 's being gnawed shorter by the instant , an army of tiny sparkling flecks trying to kill me . <p> The phage lies on the floor behind me . <p> Using my good hand , I grab it . But more of that damned juice leaks out , splattering wildly , the bugs launching a second assault , happily gnawing away my final hand . <p> I have nothing left to hold with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with more luck than skill , I kick it , sending it flying through a gap in the doorway . Then I stagger out after it - what is left of me - my arms shrunk to wagging stumps and my helmet half-digested . But I see Mollene standing in the golden light , waiting for me with those lovely breasts ; and if I was n't half-dead and repulsive , I would kiss her breasts . And I 'd kiss Tannie 's tiny ones . That 's how good and how awful I feel . <p> Poor Jusk , I tell myself . <p> Nearly murdered , and desperate for the saving taste of love ... <p> " You 'll like these arms , " the man promises , not caring the slightest about what I like or do n't like . " They 're good arms , mostly . " <p> I do n't know him . He wears extra-thick flesh like everyone in Maintenance , and a solid broad face , and judging by the smooth , unworn condition of his hands , he 's very young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free to work on me , what with the bug oven damaged and nobody sure how bad it is . <p> " How do the arms feel ? " <p> " Wrong , " I admit . <p> " Lift them . And again . " His careful adjustments make everything worse . " Now once more . Is that better ? " <p> " Much , " I lie . <p> He seems satisfied . " Yeah , they 're good arms . We did n't need to refurbish them all that much . " <p> " What 's important is you , " says another voice . A tense , acidic voice . Stepping into view , the plant manager conjures up a look of haggard concern . To the maintenance man , she says , " They need help at the oven . " <p> He makes a grateful retreat . <p> I gesture with my tight arms . " What do we know ? " <p> " About the phage ? It was built for sabotage . " She speaks in a confidential tone , admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a contaminate from outside . The sloppiest bug ovens are making some freeranging parasites ...... <p> " Why lie ? " <p> " Do you want to deal with Security troops ? Do you , Jusk ? " <p> The obvious occurs to me : Who 's in the best position to sabotage a bug oven ? Its line foreman , of course . <p> She watches as I flex my new arms , then she steps close to me , using a spare tool to make her own adjustments . I forgot that she began in Maintenance , back in that remote era when the plant was new . Her face belongs to His mother - a strong handsome face that was popular in the early shifts but is n't seen much anymore . She looks young , exactly the same as she looked when He saw her as a young boy , complete with the wise sparkle in the pale brown eyes . <p> Leaning closer , her mouth to my ear , she whispers , " That new man . How exactly did you find him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due ? Due ? " She keeps saying the name , softer and softer . Then finally , without hope , she asks , " Do you know where that wagon was taking him ? " <p> " No . " <p> The wise eyes are distant . Who can she contact , in confidence , who might actually know something ? Who can help us without Security finding out that we 're involved in an unthinkable crime ? <p> Again , I lift my arms . " They feel fine now . Thanks . " <p> Once more , she says , " Due ? " <p> " Good arms , " I say , for lack of better . <p> Then she looks at me , asking , " You know where they came from , do n't you ? " <p> From the recent suicide , sure . But I was rather hoping to get away without having to mention that . <p> I am Jusk . <p> In my locker , set between a flesh patch kit and a sample of the first bone that I helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it in Personnel . Whenever I place it against my forehead , I see my face just as He saw it . Not unhandsome , I like to think . But there 's a vagueness about the edges , which is why this Memory is here . A tangle of imperfections make it unworthy when it comes to His glorious rebirth . <p> I know precious little about the man behind that face . <p> A loyal deputy , he is . <p> And judging by the clues , someone trusted . Practically a friend . <p> In the Memory , the deputy tells Him , " You look twenty years younger , sir . It 's remarkable what these treatments can accomplish . " <p> He laughs in response - a calm and wise and enormous laugh - and with a voice that I have always loved , He promises , " And this is just the start of things . " <p> He lifts His hand before His own eyes . <p> I 'm helping to rebuild that hand . Inside it is the bone that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His deputies , too . <p> " In a few years , " He says , " we 'll all be gods .... 11 <p> " Yes , sir - " <p> " Just fucking wait ! " He roars . <p> Then the hand drops , and I can see my face smiling , and the man behind that face smiles , saying , " I can hardly wait , sir - " <p> THE BUG OVENS are down for inspection , every line useless , and for the time being , a holiday holds sway . People distract themselves with talk and little parties . The usual orgy claims its usual corner , perched on a mat of scrap aerogel . Lubricated with grease , the bodies almost glow , limbs twisting and mouths crying out , the participants working at their fun with an athletic despair . I pause for a moment , watching faces . Where I should be is on my belly inside my own oven ; foremen should show the proper interest , even if they ca n't help make repairs . But I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> She 's not in the middle of the lovers , which is unlike her . <p> Hearing a stranger 's voice , I walk up the polished aisle , coming across a second group of people doing something unexpected . <p> They are sitting quietly , listening as the stranger speaks calmly , describing the true shape of the world . <p> " We live on a great sphere , " he says . " What seems perfectly flat to little us actually falls away in every direction , equally and always . Without end . " <p> I know that voice but not the handsome face . <p> Due . <p> " Pick a line , " says the newborn , " then walk it . Provided you stay true to that line and live long enough , you will walk around the world . But of course that trip takes trillions of shifts . By the time you return home , this facility will be gone , its atoms scattered over that enormous world , and not so much as single memory of us will persist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , eager to absorb the lesson . <p> " And our round world is part of another , still larger world , " the newborn continues . " A trillion trillion times larger and several times older . And infinitely stranger . That world is a ball , too , but in its own peculiar fashion . " <p> I find myself listening . The voice compels me to do nothing but . <p> " Think of a black cold emptiness , " says Due . " That larger world is carved from that blackness , and within it are an uncountable sprinkling of little worlds like ours . " <p> Mollene leans closer to him , begging to be noticed . <p> Due grins at his largest admirer , then asks , " What 's the shape of an atom ? " <p> " It 's round , too ! " Mollene exclaims . <p> Not exactly , I remind myself . The furious wanderings of electrons can make a round shell , but it 's too easy to call them balls . <p> Yet Due agrees with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his smile nearly guileless . " What if I tell you that Creation - all there is and all there can be - is always built from spheres ? Round atoms become round worlds , and those worlds become the rounded universe , and there is no end to the round universes that make up Creation .... 11 <p> I work hard to say nothing , to let this useless noise vanish on its own . <p> But Tannie , standing at the back of the audience , asks the obvious : " How do you know these things ? " <p> Due expects the question . He welcomes it . Nodding , he waits for a moment as if in reflection , then confesses , " I do n't know how I know . I was born thinking these things , the same as I was born with these simple hands . " <p> What could I say to that ? <p> Keeping silent , I try to look unimpressed . There 's no easy way to wrestle Mollene away from her new love . Instead , I slip behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ? I need to talk to you . " <p> She seems glad for the distraction . <p> " Have you ever heard such talk ? " I ask the old woman . <p> I expect her to say , " No , " but instead she tells me , " When I was a newborn , the old discussed strange things . " <p> " Like worlds within worlds ? " <p> " Sometimes . Yes . " <p> The audience is asking questions . How big is the world in standards ? And exactly how much bigger is the blackness beyond ? But the dimensions are n't part of Due 's special knowledge , it seems . " You and I ca n't comprehend these distances , " he warns . " We 're too tiny . Too limited by a long ways . " <p> Too stupid , he means . <p> In a careful murmur , I ask Tannie what I meant to ask her partner . " Did that newborn come close to you ? While you were working , I mean . Did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> She looks at me , a worn hand wiping at her patched forehead . <p> " Mollene must have flirted with him , " I add . " I 've seen the symptoms . " <p> " I never saw him near the oven , " she assures me . " He was returning to the warehouse for supplies , and he paused for a moment , just to see what new bone looks like . " <p> " And to flirt ? " <p> She shakes her head . " I know what you want , but I ca n't give it to you . " <p> I 'm not sure what I want , yet I feel disappointed . <p> Another thought occurs to me . " When you touched that bad bone , you made a face . Why ? " <p> She shakes her head for a long moment , then says , " I do n't remember . " <p> I mean to press her , but suddenly Mollene is talking . " But what does all that mean ? " she blurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't understand . " <p> The newborn smiles , and with an easy charm , he says , " Maybe what I 'm saying is that everything is tiny . Even those wonders that we look at as being enormous ... they 're always small in comparison to something ... and never quite so wondrous ... " <p> The words do n't sound important , but they hit me like a wall of tumbling bone . <p> Due is talking about He who is our purpose . <p> Without ever breaking taboos , he tries to diminish our great and glorious Him . <p> Old Nicka has ruled the warehouse for my entire life , and he has always been Old Nicka - a small man not meant for physical labor , clad in mock-flesh worn transparent by the ages , his face patched and patched again , its original shape irretrievably lost . Yet despite time and wear , he can tell you exactly how many nine-gauge buckybug wombs are in storage , and how many are on order , and which of them will most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expeditor ? " I ask Old Nicka . <p> His response is nothing but honest . " He 's smart in the worst ways , and stupid where it hurts , and dreamy , and he talks too much , and he 'll never be any sort of expeditor . If you want to know what I think . " <p> I nod , then mention , " You never thought I 'd make much of one , either . " <p> " So where are you now ? " <p> " I 'm the line foreman . You know that . " <p> " Because you could n't cut it as an expeditor . " A crooked smile shines . " But so tell me , Jusk . Why ask about that newborn ? On his first shift ... ? " <p> " Curiosity , " I offer . <p> His eyes are mismatched in color and size . The newer eye , brown and huge , regards me for a long moment . " Do you want to speak with the boy ? He 's in the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? Did you lose track of your inventory ? " <p> " No ! He just needs practice with his counting . " The battered old face is masterful when it comes to scorn and outrage . " Next time you buy a newborn off a wagon , make sure that he can count . " <p> I nod . <p> " Is there anything else ? Or do you want all of my time ? " <p> Someday , Old Nicka will die from simple age - the rarest of deaths - and once I forget how he was , I 'll miss him , sentimentality winning out over good sense . <p> " Due is dreamy and talks too much , " I repeat . " Does he talk to you ? <p> " Not anymore . " <p> " But when he did ... did he talk about the universe , and Him ... ? " <p> " What about Him ? " Old Nicka growls . <p> I repeat what Due said , and what it seemed to mean , and what Tannie claimed to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds familiar , " Old Nicka admits , thoroughly unimpressed . " But this piss about calling Him small ... that 's just stupid ... even for you , Jusk ... ! " <p> I bristle , but remain silent . <p> " We ca n't measure His size , or any other quality . " A tiny hand , more metal than flesh , is driven into my chest . " Not His wisdom . Not His goodness . None of those things are knowable <p> " I realize that , " I mutter . <p> " Child , " Old Nicka replies , both eyes focusing on the highest shelves of his empire . " We are too small to know anything but this . What we can see , what we can count . " He withdraws his hand , then promises , " If someone ever tells me that He is small , I will kill him . Immediately , and gladly . And with His blessing , of course . " <p> THE SHIFT ENDS , FINALLY . <p> With the blaring of the first klaxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last of the new bone is packed , then shipped . The freshly repaired bug ovens are placed into sleeping modes . Trash and every tool are set in the open . Then with a practiced haste , we begin to climb the bright blue corundum stairs , zigzagging up and up as the second , final klaxon roars , warning us that the janitors are being released from their bunkers . <p> I pause , just for an instant . A silvery wave of frantic , nearly mindless machines are racing down the aisles , spraying their spit and piss into every corner , then working their way back again , licking up their juices , and with them , consuming every unwelcome molecule of grease , any diamond grit , plus severed toes and the flesh of workers too foolish or too feeble not to make the long climb . <p> The world beneath grows dark , and very loud . <p> One last set of stairs takes me to the roof . As always , my crew sits together , in an Orderly line . Umbilicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding ports . What comes from Him tastes especially delicious tonight ; I think it , and others say it . Wagons race back and forth in the main corridor . We talk among ourselves , discussing the past shift - gossip , mostly - and we make plans for the next shift . I make our plans . But I slowly realize that nobody hears me , including me . Due is talking . Again . <p> This newborn is incapable of saying anything that is n't strange . <p> " What do we know about Him ? " he inquires . " What is His nature ? " <p> He is everything to us . He is vast and vital , and we exist only to serve Him . Everyone born is born with that knowledge . <p> " But how do we serve Him ? " asks Due . " Tell me : Why does He need the likes of us ? " <p> Because something horrible has happened to Him . Unimaginable violence has tom apart His body and His mind . We have been born to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build the rest of Him from the soulless atoms . <p> But Due knows that already . He knows it , yet he ca n't give the answer in ordinary terms . " This bone plant , and the twenty million million plants just like it ... they constitute a civilization ... a civilization that arose just to serve Him ... ! " <p> The most noble of civilizations , I tell myself . <p> " Why is this our shape ? " he asks , regarding his naked self . " Two hands , two legs , and one two-eyed head ... why are such things important ... ? " <p> A long pause . <p> More than my crew are listening to him . His audience stretches across the roof ; every line crew maintains a respectful silence . <p> " By wearing this shape , " I hear , " we are honoring Him . " <p> The voice belongs to Mollene . <p> With a stern patience , Due says , " Honor is something given . But our shape was given to us , not chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way ? " cries an irritable voice . <p> My voice . <p> " This shape is adaptable . And more important , it is familiar . " Due waits for a moment , then adds , " We resemble Him in many ways , of course . Intellectually and emotionally , he once was much aswe are now . " <p> I feel a weakness spreading through me . A deep chill . <p> " Then He became more than us . The bugs made him stronger and immortal , and they refashioned his mind , making it swift and powerful . " A long pause . Or does it just seem long ? " At first , the bugs did n't have us to help them . But of course even tiny souls know the hazards of relying too much on nanoscopic agents . These agents are industrious , and stupid . And dangerous . What if they mutated and slipped free of their ovens , out of our plant and across our civilization 's borders ... spreading over the true world ... ? " <p> Bugs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of my own hands . <p> " Between the very small and very large stands us , " Due proclaims . " We have been placed here to control the bugs , and in that sense , we are defending the world . " <p> A shudder and low moan move through his audience . The words have an authenticity that dispels doubt and every question . Revelation , I 'm thinking , is a substance more real than sapphires , more perfect than the purest diamond , and it 's always too small to be seen . <p> " That 's why we exist . To protect the world ... <p> " And to protect Him , too , " I add , by reflex . <p> Due says nothing . <p> Then after a long moment - it is a long moment , this time - he asks , " Why does He make us wear these faces ? " <p> " Nobody makes us , " I begin to say . It is our giggling at what 's obvious . " We are showing that we care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pulled away . <p> The new shift begins with the Maxon . <p> Due is sitting like everyone else , legs extended before him . He stares at me as if he has always been staring at me , yet he says another 's name . " Tannie ? Why do you think He wants us to wear these faces ? " <p> The old woman is behind me , hiding behind others . <p> Quietly , with both conviction and genuine amazement , she says , " We look like the people ... the people He can trust ... " <p> " Why should that matter , Tannie ? " <p> She stands slowly , regarding her own hands and saying , " I do n't know why . " <p> Still , always , Due stares at me . <p> " If someone is so glorious , so wondrous ... why should He worry about the trust from such tiny things as us ? " <p> No one speaks . <p> A Memory wagon is sliding past us , delivering its cargo to the growing mind . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops sit in alert postures , front and aft , missing nothing as they gaze at the sky and at us . <p> So many troops , I 'm thinking . Is this a new policy ? <p> And if not , why have I never noticed them before ! <p> " Have you learned anything about him ? " <p> " About who ? " asks the plant manager . <p> " My new expeditor , " I remind her . " You were going to ask about his origins . Or did I misunderstand ... ? " <p> She acts indifferent , preoccupied . <p> " Nothing suspicious to find , " she assures . " An uneventful manufacturing cycle . Designed for heavy labor in a memory plant , which is where he was being taken . And that 's why he acts a little peculiar , I 'm sure . Memory workers need different sorts of minds . " <p> I want to feel sure , like she does . That 's all I want . <p> " Here , " she says , handing me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple memory , but the red color means that it 's a rush . I place the order against my forehead , the specifications flowing into me . I barely hear the plant manager warning , " We have to have it finished as soon as possible , or sooner . <p> " Questions ? " she asks , wanting none . <p> I shake my head , then hesitate . " What about his face ? " <p> " Whose face ? " <p> " Duels . I do n't recognize it . " I notice something in her gaze , then ask , " Have you ever seen anyone with that face ? " <p> A shrug , then a wistful grin . <p> " I wish more men wore it , " she chimes . " Whoever 's it is . " <p> I deliver the rush order to my line , giving it to the feed crew who use it to program the bug oven . This particular bone is full of diamond and superconductive fibers , which is unusual . But not remarkable . What catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed into the oven . Why is it already here ? <p> " He said we 'd need it , " my feed chief replies . <p> " Who said that ? " <p> " Due . " <p> I shake my head , complaining , " I did n't have the order till now . " <p> " I do n't know . Maybe the boy heard something . " The giant man scratches his broad round face , then adds , " Or maybe he 's a good expeditor after all . " <p> Old Nicka might have heard about the order , then told Due to bring the barium ; I tell myself that 's what must have happened . Starting down the line , I 'm preoccupied , my eyes watching my naked toes . Suddenly someone is walking beside me , and I wheel and take a clumsy step backward , as does my companion . He has my shape , my face , but a rich golden color to his bare flesh . I stare into the gold-embossed oven , and the strangest notion occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond measure . If I step away from the oven , my reflection dies . Which , I think , helps explain its desperate expression . <p> In the distance , loudly , a woman cries out , " No , no ... ! " <p> I blink a few times , then turn . <p> " Someone stop her ... no , Tannie ... ! " <p> Mollene is screaming . I break into a run , finding her at her station , but Tannie missing . The big woman tugs at her false hair , looking up , and following her eyes , I find her partner sitting on the high catwalk , in a gap in the old railing . it takes forever to understand what Tannie is doing up there . It takes too long . <p> " Get her , " Mollene begs me . " Save her , Jusk . " <p> Without hope , I start up the zigzagging stairs . Tannie is already above the curing pond . Suicides are usually swift ; she can jump fifty times before I 'll reach her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be waiting for me , rocking nervously back and forth , the corundum mesh leaving its mark in her thin rump . <p> Glancing at me , the little woman manages an odd smile . <p> I stop short , asking , " Why are you even thinking this , Tannie ? You 've done nothing wrong . " <p> " Have n't I ? " The smile is enormous , and joyless . " Oh , Jusk ... you ca n't understand what I 'm thinking ... " <p> The curing pond is directly below us , waiting for new bone . <p> " He 's not what we think he is , " she tells me . " He lies to us . All the time ... " <p> " Who 's that ? Due ? " <p> She shivers , saying , " Not the expeditor , no . " <p> " Then who - ? " <p> But I know who she means . Interrupting myself , I shake my head , telling her , " That 's ridiculous . Stupid . How can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , and I touched it ... I saw what 's real ... " I want Tannie to jump . Now . <p> " I saw the Memories we are n't suppose to see . " Her steady voice does n't match her soft forlorn face . " The terrible things that He has done with his hands . The awful orders that He 's made others carry out <p> " Shut up , " I tell her . <p> " How else can he rule the world - ? " <p> " Tannie ! " I shout . " You 're talking about bone . Bone does n't have memories . But you could easily , easily be insane . Have you thought that - ? " <p> A contemptuous look nearly slices me in two . <p> " Come here , " I say , offering a band . " I 'll take you straight to Maintenance . We 'll get you back to normal . Before our next shift ... all right ... ? " <p> The odd smile returns . " That newborn 's right about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " We exist for a purpose . We 're supposed to protect the world . " <p> I do n't know what to say . <p> She sighs , rocking forward and gazing over the brink . <p> I move , not even thinking first . I drive suddenly with my legs and grab with both arms , trying to sweep up that little body before the insanity takes her . <p> My arms close on air . <p> Suddenly I 'm lying on the corundum , watching Tannie shrink away , vanishing even before she strikes the pond . Then a furious storm of bubbles erupts , pulling what I ca n't see even further out of sight . <p> " Where 's the newborn ? " <p> Old Nicka looks up from a supply wagon 's manifest , discounting me with a glance . Only when his face drops again does he say , " In the back . Counting . " <p> The warehouse always feels enormous , mysterious . In that , nothing is new . What works on me is a powerful sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I make my next turn , I 'll become lost . It has happened more than once . A worker loses his bearings , and the shift ends without him . Then the lost man is found dead in a nameless comer , starved of power and picked bare of mock-flesh by the relentless janitors . <p> I shout for Due ; no one responds . <p> A whispering voice is counting . I follow its rhythm , coming upon him sitting behind a stockpile of assorted rare earths . His back is to me , long legs stretched out before him and a pair of giant diamond-hulled bugs balancing his hands . " One , two , " he says . " One , two . One , two . One , two . " <p> I stop short , and wait . <p> Due does n't look at me . He simply pauses , regarding the bugs as he says , " I was told to count . I 'm counting . " <p> Even the back of his head is handsome . <p> " You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , admitting , " Something awful has happened . " <p> Due turns , finally . His gray eyes are warm , but their black centers radiate a withering heat . " Does it involve me ? " <p> " No . " <p> He seems surprised , if only for a moment . <p> " One of my line workers is dead . A bone handler ..... " <p> Eyes flicker . " That fat woman ? " <p> " Her partner . Tannie . " <p> I ca n't read any emotion . It 's unfair to expect grief from newborns , but this face seems more than adult . It 's almost ancient . I 'm the newborn here , and how can I hope to outsmart this bizarre , supremely gifted monster ? <p> " I need your help on the line , " I tell him . <p> Again , the eyes flicker . " You want me to handle the bone - ? " <p> " Until we find another newborn . " <p> " Who expedites ? " <p> " No one , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the order , and we wo n't finish till the end of the shift . " <p> A curt nod , then he rises , bugs glittering in his hands . <p> " What kind of bugs are those ? " I ask . <p> " Five-gauge knitters , " he lies , setting them on an obscure shelf . <p> I step back . <p> " Besides , " he comments , " if I 'm working with you , you 'll be able to keep your eyes on me . Right ? " <p> I say nothing , knowing it is n't necessary . <p> THE NEW BONE is meant for His skull . That 's why it 's been reinforced with diamond , and that 's why it carries superconductive fibers : This bone must protect His vast mind , and it needs to be porous to His great thoughts . <p> I watch that bone come out of the oven , pure white sheets punctuated with gray-black veins . Mollene is educating her new partner about how to check the product , then carry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does n't flirt , much less try to seduce . And to her credit , when Due says something about the reinforced skull - " Why does someone so loved need so much protection ? " - Mollene responds with a disinterested shrug and sharp words : <p> " Love drags other emotions along with it . Envy and jealousy , and worse .. from what I can see ...... <p> The belt carries the new bone down to the curing pond , and after its bath , it is hoisted into the air , cleaned and dried , then given a final measurement with lasers and eyes . Then the sheets are wrapped in aerogel and stacked . One hundred sheets at a time are inserted into armored boxes , then those boxes are sealed and loaded into a parked wagon . It 's the third box that I have pulled aside , on my own authority . " Open it , " I say . My packing crew obey . " Now pull out the top sheet , " I tell them . They do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? they ask . Not answering , I tell them to stack the second sheet on the first , just as they will lay in His skull . The superconductive materials are aligned , then the third sheet is added . And the fourth . My crew does n't balk until the thirtieth sheet , but that 's enough . I hope . Ignoring their complaints , I place my forehead against the gray-black material , and nothing happens . The electric surge coursing through me is my embarrassment . In front of everyone , I 'm acting insane . <p> I start to rise , slowly . <p> And I pause . <p> Faint gray marks have been left on the edges of the bone sheets . Alone , they 're senseless . But stacked together , they become a word . A faint but unmistakable signature . Jusk , I read . A hundred times . <p> I kneel down , pressing my forehead against my name . <p> Laughter blossoms behind me , then vanishes . <p> Beneath a brilliant blue sky ... people are running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited than afraid , trying to remember what is happening ... what I 'm doing here ... <p> " ... five times ... with rocket slugs ... P ' His bodyguard steps up beside me , a tall , strong , and very pale man walking fast despite a gaping hole in his armor , a healing crater in his chest . I smell blood and pain killers on his breath , and smoke hangs thick in the air . " The assholes got past us . Not me , I mean ... I did my job .... " He hesitates , measuring his words . " Dropped two of those assholes myself . Took a round for Him , too . just wish I could have taken more , of course ... P ' <p> " Of course , " I mutter , my voice brittle . Unfamiliar to me . <p> " But He 'll be all right . No problem . " The bodyguard wobbles , then straightens himself . " How in hell did they get past us , sir ? " <p> I shrug , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who were they ? " <p> " Do n't know , " he says . " Separatists , or free-thinkers , I 'd guess ... unless it 's something closer to home ... ! " <p> From inside His own government , he means . <p> I say nothing . <p> " Out of our way ! " the bodyguard shouts . " The deputy wants to see Him ... " <p> I am the deputy . Among the hundreds , perhaps thousands of grieving sycophants , Isee the maintenance man who installed my new arms . And my feed crew chief . And Old Nicka , as well as a weepy , pain-wracked Tannie . Except these are n't the people whom I know , just as I 'm not Jusk anymore . <p> " Look what they did to Him ! " Tannie screams , in anguish . " How could they ... ? ! " <p> The crowd parts for me - out of respect , and fear - and He is revealed . Five rounds punctured His defensive array and His body armor , entering His flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been shredded . Composite bone is scattered , useless . One round even managed to puncture His skull , the warhead shaping its blast to obliterate His soul . But what is intact is what startles me . Beneath the shredded brain is a bloody but whole face - Due 's face - gray eyes opened to the blue sky , staring down Death itself . <p> The man with Old Nicka 's face kneels , a hand pressed against my back , " Do n't worry , sir , " he mutters . " I 've called for His full catalog . It 'll be on site in two minutes . " <p> The catalog is His memory , saved for emergencies . <p> " An hour , tops , " he promises . " Then He 'll be conscious again . In charge . " <p> I nod , saying nothing . <p> " I wish we could have captured one of those assassins , " he says , giving the bodyguard a reproachful glance . " Apparently they were n't using even the simplest nano-system . A pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You should n't , sir , " says the bodyguard . " It might muddy up the healing cycle , if your little friends get mixed in with His ... " <p> My hand stops short , then drops , touching a fragment of freshly killed bone . <p> Hopefully that will be enough .... <p> " Sir , " I hear . " Step on back , please . We 've got to let him heal on his own , sir . " <p> I rise , nodding . <p> And for the first time in years , I feel the smallest beginnings of hope .... <p> The plant manager invites me into her office . Set on a medium-high catwalk , it affords an impressive view of the entire plant . But all I can see is the stranger sitting behind her desk . He wears the bodyguard 's face and body , and over his flesh is diamond mail of the sort used by Security troops . Suspicious eyes look at me , then move about the office . Even the most benign object seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking the bone , " says the manager . She makes no attempt to introduce our guest . " Find anything ? " <p> I shake my head . " No , nothing . " <p> " Neither have we , " says the bodyguard , or whatever he is . Then he grins , adding , " We do n't need to unpack bone to make sure that it 's all right . " <p> I took at the manager . " What 's going on ? " <p> " Ask me , " says the bodyguard . <p> I turn to him , saying nothing . <p> " You purchased a newborn . Due is his chosen name . Is that right ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And you 're suspicious of him ? " <p> I nod . <p> " There 's no reason to be . He has a simple defect , something that happens on rare occasions . " The lie is well-practiced , seamless . " He 's responsible for some of your troubles , but they are n't very serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after everything , I want to believe him . <p> With a careful voice , I ask , " If you 're familiar with the problem , why do n't you just take him out of here ? " <p> My manager says , " Jusk ... " <p> " We are getting him . Do n't worry . " The bodyguard smiles , casually scratching his crotch . " I 'm here as a formality . As I understand it , you 've had several conversations with the newborn . Correct ? " <p> " I am his boss - " <p> " The warehouse manager claims that you 've spoken to Due at length . Do you remember the subjects ? " <p> I hesitate . <p> The bodyguard 's suspicions are focused squarely on me . <p> Through the crystal walls of the office , I can see my line stretching out below me . Due and Mollene are handling the latest bone , working together smoothly . Perfectly . The bodyguard 's associates are stalking Due . They creep along the narrow aisles , each wearing diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments , everything is going to end . Whatever everything is ... <p> " Jusk ? " says my manager , in pain . " Can you answer his question , please ? " <p> I look at the bodyguard , and smile . <p> The ovens and belts stop in place and every light suddenly goes out , an instant of shocked silence followed by the rattling charge of janitors , and then , by hundreds of distant , white-hot screams . <p> I bolt downstairs , pushing against the panicked flow of bodies . <p> A limping figure slams against me , and I know those pendulous breasts . " Where is he ? ' I I shout at Mollene . " Where 's Due ? <p> " Jusk ... ? " she squeals . " Are you all right ? " <p> She is n't . The janitors have plucked the meat off one of her legs , then tried to take the leg , too . But all I can think about is my expeditor . " Is he with you ? Did he say anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pressing her mouth to my ear , she says , " I 'm tired , Jusk ... so tired ... <p> I slip past her , reaching the floor just as the dim emergency lights come on . A single janitor is calmly dismantling one of the security troops . Simple eyes regard and dismiss me , then the machine returns to its task , removing another limb , inflicting careful misery on its victim . <p> An electric saber lies forgotten against a pallet . <p> it accepts my hand , which it should n't do . And it slices into the pallet on my first attempt , beads of pure calcium bouncing frantically across the diamond floor . <p> I run with the quickest beads , making for the back of the plant . <p> " Due , " I call out . " Show yourself , Due ! " <p> Silence . <p> When everything works normally , the warehouse is dimly lit . The indifferent glow of the emergency lights are nearly useless inside that cavernous place , accomplishing nothing but to make the shadows darker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Due . " <p> Someone moves in the shadows . <p> " You 're going to run out of tricks , " I tell him , dropping my saber to my side . " Eventually Security is going to catch you and kill you , and what 's accomplished ? A single bone plant is a shift behind in its work , which is nothing . Some or most of its workers have to be replaced , but that wo n't take long . And He ends up being reborn just the same . <p> " Is that what you want , Due ? " <p> In the blackest shadow , flesh brushes against a pallet . <p> I step closer , saying , " I 'm sorry . That I stole you away from your mission . That I doubted what you were telling us . And now that I know better , I 'm very , very sorry that He 's going to live again ... <p> " If there 's anyway that I can help - " <p> A figure charges out of the darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a hammer , I realize finally . Then I look at the patched face , realizing that it 's Old Nicka , not Due , and too late by a long ways , I start to lift my saber , backing up , my sputtering voice saying , " No , wait ... ! " <p> A sharp , clean noise comes from nowhere . Everywhere . <p> Old Nicka collapses at my feet , the hammer missing my head by nothing , then banging its way to the floor . <p> " You are mistaken , " I hear . " But it 's an easily forgiven mistake . " <p> Due appears on my left , the handsome face offering a smile tinged with sadness . " I 've never wanted Him to stay dead . Even if that was possible , it would be dangerous . There would be a terrible civil war afterward , then someone would replace Him . Who knows who ? And would that person be a more benign leader ? You ca n't tell me yes , Jusk , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conceding the point . <p> " We 're here to protect the world , " he promises . " And the best way to do that is to rebuild Him , but improve Him , too . To give Him insights so far lacking in Him , and a spirit worthy of His station ... " <p> With a flourish , Due hands me that pair of five-gauge knitters . <p> " But about the rest of it , you 're right , " he tells me . No more smiles , just sadness . " I 'm about to be caught , and I 'll be killed . Which leaves you with a debt to pay .... " <p> He says . " The best of luck . Now , and always . " <p> Due has already cut a hole in the back wall of the warehouse , and when I climb through , in an instant , I 've left the only home that I 've ever known . <p> The birth wagon waits . <p> Its driver wears Mollene 's face and body , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me to climb into the back end , and whatever happens , I should n't talk . Then she climbs in after me and shuts the gate , hesitating briefly when the sound of fighting comes from the warehouse . <p> A bomb detonates somewhere close , shaking us . <p> The wagon drives itself , and this new Mollene gets me to lie on my back , then checks to make sure that I have both of the knitters . <p> " What are these things supposed to do ? " I inquire . <p> " When it 's time , they 'll explain themselves . " Then she warns me firmly , " You must stay quiet . " <p> I nod . <p> The woman has a knife with the thinnest of blades , and leaning over me , she says , " Now I need to remove your flesh . To make you look like a newborn again . " <p> I nod again , compliant as a newborn . <p> More bombs detonate . We 're a long way from the plant , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the Security troops . <p> With a practiced surety , the woman cuts at my legs . <p> Then , higher . <p> I ca n't help myself . I reach up with both hands , grabbing one of the enormous breasts , sucking on the brownish red nipple exactly as He must have done in His youth . Desperately . Gratefully . Wishing the moment will never end . <p> " Stop that , " she tells me , pushing my face down again . <p> But I ca n't . I need the touch of flesh . Any flesh . So I grab hold of her again , and eventually she stops fighting me . I cling tight until nothing 's left of Jusk but a shiny body and his familiar face , and even then I wo n't let go easily , sucking with a metal mouth when my fleshy one lies in the pile with the rest of the Scrap . <p> Author Affiliation
