Toxic Bachelors By Danielle Steel Random House Danielle Steel 1 The sun was brilliant and hot , shining down on the deck of the motor yacht Blue Moon . She was 240 feet , eighty meters , of sleek , exquisite powerboat , remarkably designed . Pool , helipad , six elegant , luxurious guest cabins , a master suite right out of a movie and an impeccably trained crew of sixteen . The Blue Moon-and her owner-had appeared in every yachting magazine around the world . Charles Sumner Harrington had bought her from a Saudi prince six years before . He had bought his first yacht , a seventy-five-foot sailboat , when he was twenty-two . She had been called the Dream . Twenty-four years later , he enjoyed life on his boat as much as he had then . At forty-six , Charles Harrington knew that he was a lucky man . In many ways , seemingly , life had been easy for him . At twenty-one , he had inherited an enormous fortune and had handled it responsibly in the twenty-five years since . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running his family 's foundation . Charlie was well aware that few people on earth were as blessed as he , and he had done much to improve the lot of those less fortunate , both through the foundation and privately . He was well aware that he had an awesome responsibility , and even as a young man , he had thought of others first . He was particularly passionate about disadvantaged young people and children . The foundation did impressive work in education , provided medical assistance to the indigent , particularly in developing countries , and was dedicated to the prevention of child abuse for inner-city kids . Charles Harrington was a leader of the community , doing his philanthropic work quietly , through the foundation , or anonymously , whenever possible . Charles Harrington was a humanitarian , and an extremely caring , conscientious person . But he also laughed mischievously when he admitted that he was extremely spoiled , and made no apologies for the way he lived . He could afford it , and spent millions every year on the well-being of others , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , had no children , enjoyed living well , and when appropriate , took pleasure in sharing his lifestyle with his friends . Every year , without fail , Charlie and his two closest friends , Adam Weiss and Gray Hawk , spent the month of August on Charlie 's yacht , floating around the Mediterranean , stopping wherever they chose . It was a trip they had taken together for the past ten years . It was one they all looked forward to , and would have done just about anything not to miss . Every year , come hell or high water , on August first , Adam and Gray flew to Nice and boarded the Blue Moon for a month-just as they had done on her predecessors every year before that . Charlie was usually on the boat for July as well , and sometimes did n't return to New York until mid- or even late September . All his foundation and financial matters were easily handled from the boat . But August was devoted to pure fun . And this year was no different . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat shifted gently , at anchor , outside the port of St. Tropez . They had had a late night the night before , and had come home at four a.m . In spite of the late night , Charlie was up early , although his recollections of the evening before were a little vague . They usually were when Gray and Adam were involved . They were a fearsome trio , but their fun was harmless . They answered to no one , none of the three men were married , and at the moment none had girlfriends . They had long since agreed that , whatever their situations , they would come aboard alone , and spend the month as bachelors , living among men , indulging themselves . They owed no one apologies or explanations , and each of them worked hard in his own way during the rest of the year , Charlie as a philanthropist , Adam as an attorney , and Gray as an artist . Charlie liked to say that they earned their month off , and deserved their annual trip . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't . His single status , he claimed , was by happenstance and , so far , sheer bad luck . He said he wanted to get married , but had n't found the right woman yet , despite a lifetime of searching . But he was still looking , with meticulous determination . He had been engaged four times in his younger days , although not recently , and each time something had happened to cause the wedding to be called off , much to his chagrin , and deep regret . His first fiancee had slept with his best friend three weeks before the wedding , which had caused a veritable explosion in his life . And of course he had no choice but to call off the wedding . He had been thirty at the time . His second bride-to-be had taken a job in London as soon as they got engaged . He had commuted diligently to see her , while she continued to work for British Vogue , and could hardly make time to see him while he waited patiently in the flat he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two months before the wedding , she admitted that she wanted a career , and could n't see herself giving up work when they got married , which was important to him . He thought she should stay home and have kids . He did n't want to be married to a career woman , so they agreed to part company-amicably of course , but it had been an enormous disappointment to him . He had been thirty-two at the time , and ever more determined to find the woman of his dreams . A year later he was sure he 'd found her-she was a fantastic girl , and was willing to give up medical school for him . They went to South America together , on trips for the foundation , to visit children in developing countries . They had everything in common , and six months after they met , they got engaged . All went well , until Charlie realized his fiancee was inseparable from her twin sister , and expected to take her everywhere with them . He and the twin sister had taken an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates and endless arguments each time they met . He felt certain that they would continue to dislike each other in alarming ways . He had bowed out that time too , and his would-be bride agreed . Her sister was too important to her to marry a man who genuinely despised her twin . She had married someone else within a year , and her twin moved in with them , which told Charlie he 'd done the right thing . Charlie 's last engagement had come to a disastrous end five years before . She loved Charlie , but even after couples counseling with him , said she did n't want children . No matter how much she said she loved him , she would n't budge an inch . He thought at first he could convince her otherwise , but he never did , so they parted friends . He always did . Without exception . Charlie had managed to stay friends with every woman he had ever gone out with . At Christmastime , he was deluged with cards from women he had once cared about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men . At a glance , if one looked at the photographs of them and their families , they all looked the same . Beautiful , blond , well-bred women from aristocratic families , who had gone to the right schools , and married the right people . They smiled at him from their Christmas cards , with their prosperous-looking husbands at their side , and their towheaded children gathered around them . He was still in touch with many of them , they all loved Charlie , and remembered him fondly . His friends Adam and Gray kept telling him to give up on debutantes and socialites and go out with a " real " woman , the definition of which varied according to their respective descriptions . But Charlie knew exactly what he wanted . A well-born , well-heeled , well-educated , intelligent woman who would share the same values , same ideals , and had a similarly aristocratic background to his . That was important to him . His own family could be traced back to the fifteenth century , in England , his fortune was many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had gone to Princeton . His mother had gone to Miss Porter 's , and finishing school in Europe , as had his sister , and he wanted to marry a woman just like them . It was an archaic point of view , and seemed snobbish in some ways , but Charlie knew what he wanted and needed , and what suited him . He himself was old-fashioned in some ways , and had traditional values . He was politically conservative , eminently respectable , and if he had a fling here and there , it was always done politely , with the utmost discretion . Charlie was a gentleman and a man of elegance and distinction to his very soul . He was attentive , kind , generous , and charming . His manners were impeccable , and women loved him . He had long since become a challenge to the women in New York , and the many places where he traveled and had friends . Everybody loved Charlie , it was hard not to . Marrying Charles Harrington would have been a major coup for anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had searched the world , looking for the right woman , the perfect one for him . And instead he met lovely women everywhere , who seemed delightful and appealing at first , and always had a fatal flaw that stopped him in his tracks just before he got to the altar . As much as it was for them , it was disheartening for him . His plans to marry and have children had been thwarted every time . At forty-six , he was still a bachelor , through no fault of his own , he said . Wherever the right woman was hiding these days , he was still determined to find her , and Charlie felt sure he would , one day . He just did n't know when . And for all the impostors masquerading as the right women , he was able to detect their fatal flaws every time . The one thing he consoled himself with was that he had n't married the wrong one . He was determined not to let that happen . And he was grateful that so far he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fatal flaws . He knew the right woman was out there somewhere , he just had n't found her yet . But one day he knew he would . Charlie sat with his eyes closed and his face to the sun , as two stewardesses served him breakfast , and poured him a second cup of coffee . He had drunk a number of martinis , preceded by champagne the night before , but after a swim before he sat down to breakfast he felt better . He was a powerful swimmer , and a skilled windsurfer . He had been the captain of the swimming team at Princeton . Despite his age , he was fiercely athletic . He was an avid skier , played squash at every opportunity in the winter , and tennis in the summer . It not only improved his health , but he had the body of a man half his age . Charlie was a strikingly handsome man-tall , slim , with sandy blond hair that concealed whatever gray he 'd acquired over time . He had blue eyes and , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a stunning-looking man , and his preference in women ran to tall , thin aristocratic blondes . He never thought about it particularly , but his mother and sister had both been tall blondes . His mother had been spectacularly beautiful , and his sister had been a tennis star in college when she dropped out to take care of him . His parents had both been killed in a head-on collision while on vacation in Italy when he was sixteen . His sister had been twenty-one , and had left Vassar in her junior year , to come home and take on the responsibilities of running the family , in the absence of their parents . It still brought tears to Charlie 's eyes when he thought about his sister . Ellen had said she would go back to finish college when he went to college two years later . It was a sacrifice she was more than willing to make for him . She had been an extraordinary woman , and Charlie adored her . But by the time he left for college , although he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ellen was ill . She had managed to keep the seriousness of her illness from him for nearly three years . She said she was too busy working at the foundation to go back to college , and he had believed her . In fact , she had a brain tumor , and fought a valiant battle . They had determined early on that the tumor was inoperable because of its location . Ellen died at twenty-six , just months before Charlie graduated from Princeton . Charlie had no one to see him graduate . With his sister and parents gone , he was virtually alone in the world , with a vast fortune , and a great sense of responsibility for all they left him . He bought his first sailboat shortly after he graduated and for two years he sailed around the world . There was barely a day that went by that he did n't think about his sister and all she had done for him . She had even given up college for him , and had been there for him in every way until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their family life had always been harmonious and loving . The only thing that had gone wrong in his early life was that everyone who had loved him , and whom he loved , had died , and left him alone . His worst fear was of loving someone else , and having them die too . When he 'd come back from traveling the world on his yacht , he was twenty-four years old . He had gone to Columbia Business School and gotten an MBA , and learned about his investments , and how to run the foundation . He had grown up overnight and become responsible for everything in his world . Charlie had never let anyone down in his life . He knew that neither his parents nor Ellen had abandoned him intentionally , but he was alone in the world , without family , at a very young age . He had remarkable material benefits , and a few well-chosen friends . But he knew that until he found the right woman , he would be alone in important ways . He was n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a woman like his mother and Ellen , a woman who would stand by him till the end . The fact that they had ultimately left him alone and terrified was n't something he admitted to himself , not often anyway . It had n't been their fault . It was simply a rotten turn of fate . Which made it all the more important for him to find the right woman , one he knew he could count on , who would be a good mother to his children , a woman who was nearly perfect in every way . That was vital to him . To Charlie , that woman was worth the wait . From the Hardcover edition .
