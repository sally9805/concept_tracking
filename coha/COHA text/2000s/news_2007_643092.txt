<p> Fatou Faye was not the first person to head for Spain from her run-down corner of Dakar , the Senegalese capital . Half a dozen friends and relatives left before her , squeezing into wooden fishing boats and wagering their lives on the high seas for the chance of a future in Europe . <p> " Some succeeded , " Ms. Faye said flatly . " Some were sent back . Some drowned . " <p> But there was no dangerous sea voyage for Ms. Faye , a 32-year-old mother of two who came to Spain under circumstances that thousands of her compatriots can only dream of : on a plane , with a visa and a job that pays five times what she earned back home . <p> Ms. Faye is one of the first Senegalese workers to be hired under a Spanish labor plan that offers legal passage and a one-year work permit to some with the idea that by raising the possibility of reaching Spain legally , young Africans will be dissuaded from throwing themselves on the mercy of the Atlantic . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims to bring hundreds of workers to Spain this year with renewable one-year visas and jobs . Workers on one-year permits may have their contracts extended , at which point they have the right to bring over their immediate family . Ultimately , officials here say , the plan is to bring in thousands of immigrants through the program . <p> " I thought , ' Thank God . I will be able to help my father and mother , my brothers and sisters , ' " Ms. Faye said of the moment when she heard she had a job waiting for her at Acciona , a major Spanish building and cleaning company . <p> In January , she flew with 72 others to Spain , where Acciona helped her find the three-bedroom house she shares with four other Senegalese on the edge of this small industrial town . She now earns $960 a month after taxes , as part of a cleaning team at a ham processing factory . <p> As Europe struggles to cope with an unstinting flow of desperate migrants to its southern shores , Spain 's African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won praise for the government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero . <p> Several companies are in the process of hiring people in Dakar to come to work in Spain for a year , potentially more . Those companies include McDonald 's ; Carrefour , a French retailer ; and Vips , a Spanish convenience store chain . <p> " It 's advanced thinking in terms of migration policy , " Peter Sutherland , the United Nations special representative for migration , said in a telephone interview . " It 's trailblazing . " <p> Supporters of the program say they are under no illusion that it will fix Europe 's migration problem . <p> " When you measure the volume of people we can hire against the needs of their countries , it 's a drop in the ocean , " said Miguel Angel Garcia , head of human resources for Vips , which has hired 25 people from Senegal and is in the process of hiring 40 more . " But we just have to keep working , drop by drop . " <p> A surge in sub-Saharan migration last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Africans try to use as a gateway to Europe , prompted Spain to toughen its stance on immigration and , along with the rest of Europe , extend the cordon around its shores with international patrols . <p> This year , the number of arrivals has fallen steeply : about 6,000 migrants landed in the Canaries in the first seven months , compared to 13,000 in the same period of 2006 . Spanish officials and emergency workers based in the Canaries attributed the decline to better maritime surveillance and cooperation from countries like Senegal , as well as rougher seas . <p> Mr. Zapatero 's immigration policy has not always drawn applause . Spain 's decision to legalize 600,000 immigrants in 2005 infuriated some European partners , who believe it encouraged a flood of migrants . <p> But as Europe closes its door to illegal immigrants , Spain is opening a small window of possibility . Labor Minister Jesus Caldera signed an agreement with Gambia on Wednesday to invest $1.3 million to train Gambians who could be recruited to work in Spain . In July , Spain signed similar agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for humanitarian reasons that Spain is reaching out to African migrants . Rapid economic growth has forced companies to look abroad to cover a dearth of local labor . Thousands of migrants are hired from Eastern Europe , Morocco and Latin America each year to pick strawberries , wait tables and work in the country 's booming construction sector . <p> " There are parts of Spain where it 's impossible to find qualified workers , " said Juan Manuel Cruz , head of labor relations for Acciona . He said the group of Senegalese workers was " very well trained , with strong language skills " and had " a huge will to work . " <p> For Ms. Faye , the message behind the new Spanish labor program was clear . Senegal announced the plan after it agreed to take back hundreds of illegal Senegalese migrants from Spain in September . <p> When Ms. Faye boarded a Spanish government plane bound for Madrid in January , it had just returned a group of illegal Senegalese immigrants to Dakar . No migrant in Spain illegally in the past two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There need to be more contracts like this , more possibilities for young people to come here , " said Issa Faye , 30 , no relation to Fatou . He was earning $130 a month driving a taxi in Dakar when he was recruited by Acciona to work in Torrijos , about 1,800 miles from his home . <p> Mr. Faye said that getting to Europe was a local obsession . He had made three unsuccessful attempts , once losing about $1,600 to an immigration agent . <p> " If a person has no alternative , he will board a fishing boat , " he said . <p> Spanish officials say the government approach to African migration squares with existing efforts to raise Spain 's profile in the region under a three-year Africa Plan unveiled in 2006 . Spain has opened new embassies in Cape Verde , Mali , Niger , Guinea and Guinea-Bissau , and has installed full-time diplomatic representatives in Liberia , Gambia and Sierra Leone . <p> " We want to completely change the parameters of Spain 's relationship with Africa , " Bernardino Leon Gross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview . <p> Even though migration has risen to the top of the agenda , Mr. Leon said , Spain is trying to maintain a long view and deal with the factors that prompt migrants to leave home in the first place . <p> Mr. Sutherland of the United Nations said that Spain 's approach could serve as an example for Europe . " Immigration involves foreign affairs , health , economics , border affairs , all of those things , " he said . Immigration is " clearly a European problem , so the Spanish efforts have to be married into a European policy , " he said . " Europe does n't stop at the Pyrenees . " ##
