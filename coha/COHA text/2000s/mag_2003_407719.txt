Catherine Zeta-Jones gets personal about how motherhood and marriage ( to Michael Douglas ) have changed her , the secret to dressing for her shape and why she refuses to apologize for her amibition . By Nancy Collins // Photographed by Peter Lindbergh Michael calls me Dame Doom because I will always see the worst-case scenario , " laughs Catherine Zeta-Jones as she sinks into plump cushions on the veranda of the sprawling manor house in Bermuda that she shares with husband Michael Douglas . " It 's my Welsh , blackIrish part . I coud n't believe my luck winning the Oscar , then spent the next three weeks thinking something was going to go wrong with my daughter 's birth . All this good stuff ca n't be happening to me . I said , " Please God , take the Oscar back , just make everything okay with Carys . ' ' " Apparently , God was listening , because on April 20 , Carys Zeta Douglas , a beautiful replica of her mother , with a dainty version of her dad 's famous cleft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Catherine woke up in the middle of the night in their New York apartment with labor pains . " I said , " Michael ' ' - nudge , nudge-'get the clock . ' When the contractions were a minute apart , we left Manhattan for the hospital in New Jersey . If it had been rush hour , I would 've had the baby in the car . " Fortunately , Carys had the grace to wait until the epidural kicked in . ( " After my son , Dylan , I told Michael , " Next time we do this , I 'm having the epidural before I conceive ! ' ' " ) " Women are going to hate me , " says the actress , " but I pushed Dylan out in 30 minutes , Carys in 10 . As for breast-feeding , well , Dylan I nursed for 10 weeks and Carys for just under four . Once her baby nurse fed her a bottle for the night , she did n't like me very much . " Which was not entirely a bad thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner without my husband having to look at the clock and say , " My wife has to go to the bathroom to pump . ' Partnership is so important . Babies are ours for borrowed time ... soon enough , it 'll be , " Thanks for everything . See you . ' I do n't want to look at my husband then and say , " Hey , remember me ? How I breast-fed for a year-and-a-half ? ' ' " She pauses . " I have two children , projects I 'm producing , a household to run .... Without Michael 's support , I 'm lost . " It is hard to imagine Catherine ever truly lost . After all , this is a woman who in a three-year rush married Michael Douglas , popped out two kids and three movies , took on the role of global spokeswoman for Elizabeth Arden and T-Mobile and tap-danced her way to her first Academy Award-picking up the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Chicago some 30 minutes after belting out the film 's nominated song , " I Move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tm eight months pregnant , but when in my life will I get the chance to be up there along with Paul Simon and U2 singing an Academy Award-nominated song ? ' I thought , No matter what , I 'm having a great night at the Oscars . " But then , Catherine has always been someone who knows what she wants , a woman with ambition-a word she wholeheartedly embraces . " People make it sound like I want money and fame , but I have ambitions for everything ... making this house complete , getting the damned toilet door put on right , learning to sail . I ca n't imagine myself without ambition . " In her new film , Catherine plays a dame burning up with it . Intolerable Cruelty does for divorce lawyers what The Player did for Hollywood execs-that is , it sends them up in smart , hilarious style , courtesy of those masters of the skewered perspective , Joel and Ethan Coen . Draped in an array of glam frocks , Catherine plays " a sophisticated broad , " an oft-married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's slick-talking divorce lawyer , George Clooney . " I love the idea of being attracted to the person you hate more than anyone else in the world , " chuckles Catherine . " It 's a nice mix of brutality and finding your true love . " When it comes to her own true loves , Catherine 's conversation never veers far from her children and husband , who has absconded to Ireland with a couple of pals for a golf-junkie weekend , calling by cell phone to inform his wife that the boys , having knocked out 18 holes , are roughing their way to the next nine . Dressed in a short , Christian Lacroix print skirt , Havaianas flip-flops and a black Lycra " cheap-o " T-shirt , Catherine looks younger and more vulnerable than the sophisticated , public image she projects . She is , in fact , direct , warm and fun-lots of fun . Her luxurious black hair is pulled back in a casual twist , and though she is wearing makeup , she assures it 's a rarity in her island life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she packed on during pregnancy-a weight gain on full and glorious display as she traveled around the world promoting Chicago . As the miles piled up , so did the pounds . " It did n't bother me . I said , Okay , I took off the 50 pounds I gained with Dylan , I can do it again . ' ' " At this instant , Dorothy , baby nurse to both of Catherine 's offspring , appears , cuddling a snoozing bundle of femininity , Carys Douglas , swathed in an elaborate , off-white antique silk dress . With three-year-old son Dylan , a brown-haired , moptopped dynamo , finally coaxed into his afternoon nap , his mother is left to marvel at the differences between her babies . " When Dylan was born , what freaked me out was that he was a boy , that I had made ... balls , " she laughs . " Dylans a showman ; it 's in the genes . He loves to sing , and since I 'm a musical-comedy fan , he knows all the songs from Chitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , " I 've arrived ! " while Carys was much more pensive . In fact , Michael 's mom told me she 's like he was as a child-thoughtful . " Her husband , she adds with obvious pride , is " amazing with our kids . At night , Michael says , " Honey , go on to dinner . I 'll bathe Dylan and put him to bed , and I 'll see you later . ' Even when Dylan was a tiny baby-and I was in that breast-feeding stage where you 're too tired to get out of bed-Michael would get him , put him on my chest , burp and change him . Later , he 'd put him on the other side and do it all again . " The couple 's devotion to parenthood is hardly surprising , since kids were on Michael 's mind , at least , the first time he laid eyes on Catherine in person , at the 1998 Deauville Film Festival . He declared : " I want to father your children . " " Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , when everybody was saying we were just a Hollywood fling , we knew what we had , " says Catherine . " I never stopped to question what being pregnant might do to my career . Other than quickly saying no to projects I could n't do , I was thrilled . " She was also in for a crash course on what it means to be famously pregnant . " One British magazine said that with Dylan I was " too posh to push , ' ' " she recalls , " and that I had scheduled a C-section when , in fact , both my kids were natural childbirths , but with medication . " Catherine stops , a ferocity creeping into her voice as she prepares to address the ubiquitous pregnancy police . " Look , I never signed up to be a role model for anybody other than my children , " she says . " I never wanted to be a political spokesperson . I have my own problems , and I 'll deal with them . If I 'm seeking help , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame me if I slip up or if I do n't do what you thought I was going to do . " What Catherine always wanted to be was a performer . When she was enrolled in dance classes at age four , at a church behind the Jones house in Swansea , Wales , it quickly became apparent to her frustrated performer of a father , a candy manufacturer , that the kid had talent . " We woke on Sundays , Elvis Presley and Van Morrison blaring , my dad singing along , " she chuckles . " So he really focused me . " As her " coach , " he designed a club act , schlepped his daughter to endless competitions-one of which , an audition for a stage production of Bugsy Malone , saw Catherine , in true American Idol style , queuing for seven hours with " thousands and thousands of other kids " before landing a lead in the London show . In a decision that the new mother doubts she could make for her children , Catherines parents allowed her , at 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , where she snagged the lead in a West End revival of 42nd Street by 17 , beginning a career that would make her a star in England . " I lived with my former tutor , a single mother . I had a room with a bed , chest of drawers and closet . For someone from the sticks , I was streetwise . " Catherine moves into present time , reeling off from memory a six-month travel/work schedule that will have her hopping continents and tackling projects that include playing Tom Hanks ' love interest in Steven Spielberg 's film Terminal . In the end , her life appears to be a Herculean feat of management , a skill she has learned a lot about from her husband . " Every Friday , he says : " Okay . TGIF . Come on , honey , this pile of papers has been sitting here for a week ; out it goes . ' ' " Michael 's organizational tentacles have even reached into his wife 's closet , introducing her to clothes archiving , something he has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever worn-the red Versace from my first Oscars , all my movie clothes , even the outfit I wore the night I met Michael-is dry-cleaned , archived and put into cold storage in Los Angeles . " Catherine describes her relationship with designers as " something I never take for granted . " During the months of events surfounding Chicago , it was Valentine , Narciso Rodriguez , Richard Tyler and Donatella Versace who kept her ever-glamorous despite her ever-burgeoning waistline . " To my disdain , I had to measure myself for the cutters the whole way throueh , " she laughs . " It 's humbling to send gigantic waist measurements to Versace couture . " Wisely , Catherine and Co. chose to emphasize her growing bosom-the crux , as it turns out , of her own fashion philosophy . " I need structure . These breast-feeding boobies need to have support , so I 'm a big fan of undergarments . I tell designers , " Lets start there and build out . ' When I 'm in an evening dress , I need to feel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs , recalling when she swept into the Golden Globes wearing a revealing Versace and " a goddamned huge Fred Leighton diamond at my neck . Michael said , " I do n't know how you can put that diamond on when those bosoms are so big . You ca n't focus . ' ' " The actress is the first to admit that when it comes to being Catherine ZetaJones , it takes a village , or , more precisely , Team Zeta , as she 's dubbed them , a coterie of professionals she calls her " security blanket " : hairdresser Karyn Huston , makeup artist Cindy Williams and voice coach Joy Allison . " When I go to a function , it 's business , a performance , so often I like to be different characters ... Sophia Loren in Dolce &; Gabbana ... a marquesa in Versace . I tell Dylan , " Mommy ca n't read you bedtime stories tonight . ' ' " When she is n't working , Catherine admits that many times she simply ca n't be bothered . " Michael says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get together with people . But by the time we get the kids to sleep , it 's 8 o'clock . So to get all dolled up and go out ... " she trails off . If anything , says the woman who once described herself as volatile , marriage and motherhood have calmed her down . " Michael and I never raise our voices to our children or each other . In the past , my reaction would 've been to dramatize things-the louder you shout , the better they 'll hear you-more out m of insecurity than anything else . " These days , of course , it is difficult to envision what could possibly make her feel insecure . " Personally and professionally , " she admits , " this last year is going to be a hard one to beat . But , " she continues , the lilt of challenge in her voice , " I 'm definitely ready to go back to work . I was always my father 's little girl . And though Michael loves his sons , he has no idea what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . " She pauses , a glint in her eye . " As my dad always said to me , " You show " em , babe . You show " em what you 're made of ! ' ' " Catherine Zeta-Jones can be seen this month in Intolerable Cruelty .
