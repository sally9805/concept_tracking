<p> Miami  --  When former Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell moved with his family to south Florida 3 1/2 years ago to take a job with a nationally prominent law firm and settle into a palmy second life near the beach , this was n't in the game plan . <p> Not the ugly dormitories . <p> Not the prison guards . <p> Not the prison food . <p> A week from now , Campbell , 53 , will walk into Federal Correctional Institute , Miami , and surrender the clothes on his back and the money in his pocket . He 'll put on white underwear , white socks , a green shirt , green pants and black shoes , and disappear into the prison population . <p> There , for the next 2 1/2 years , he 'll serve his time on three federal tax charges , bunking in the minimum security Federal Prison Camp Miami , a collection of dormitory-like buildings . Across the yard sits the high-security prison , its walls topped with coils of razor wire , its most famous inmate Manuel Antonio Noriega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in FCI Miami . <p> The setting is a far cry from the life Campbell hoped to have cut out for himself and his family  --  wife Sharon , children Billy and Christina  --  when he left office in 2002 after two terms as mayor and while Atlanta City Hall was under the cloud of the federal investigation that led to the conviction of 10 people in his administration . <p> Boom to busted <p> As mayor , Campbell presided over Atlanta during boom times . The city hosted the 1996 Olympics , expanded the airport  --  the economic engine of the region  --  and downtown saw a reduction in crime and a revival of neighborhoods . <p> But Campbell was indicted in 2004 and charged with racketeering and failure to report his taxes . He was acquitted in March of corruption but convicted of not paying taxes . Sentenced in June , he is appealing his conviction . In prison , Campbell 's living quarters will be a 10-by-10 foot cubicle probably shared with another prisoner , said prison spokesman Pete Diaz . <p> The cubicle is in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishings are hard and spare : linoleum floor , bunk , nightstand and a metal locker , where Campbell will store the prison garb he wears every day until he walks out a free man in February 2009 . <p> Federal officials declined to give an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter a tour of the facility or grant an interview with Warden Jorge Pastrana . But attorneys with clients who have been inmates in Federal Prison Camp Miami describe the prison using terms like " dorm life " and " college campus . " <p> From the outside , FCI Miami is unforbidding . The grounds are grassy , with a few palm trees sprinkled around . There 's a soccer field , a basketball court and an exercise track where last week , at midday , several inmates were walking and jogging in shorts and T-shirts . <p> There 's no guard gate at the main entrance off 137 Avenue . Visitors can drive in , park out front and take the covered walkway inside the stucco and red tiled roof main building before they encounter their first prison guard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates are powerless and the routine numbing , but , by prison standards , the facility where Campbell will spend the next roughly 912 days is n't dangerous , said Howard O. Kieffer , a Santa Ana , Calif. , attorney who specializes in federal prisons and whose clients have served time at FCI Miami . <p> " The inmates know if they step out of line , they 'll be sent to the higher security prison , and they do n't want that , " said Kieffer . " Probably the most violent thing Campbell will encounter at FCI Miami is if somebody shouts at him for breaking in line at the clothes dryer . " <p> Upscale neighborhood <p> Through his attorney , Michael Coleman , Campbell said that if he must be incarcerated he is glad it will be close to his family . <p> About 80 miles north of Miami is Ballenisle , a gated country club community in Palm Beach Gardens , where Campbell and his family live in a $690,000 home he bought in December , just before going to trial in Atlanta . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few blocks away . It 's a one-story stucco with red terra cotta roof and sits beside the 14th hole of one of the community 's three golf courses . <p> Campbell 's Ballenisle neighbors include the tennis players Venus and Serena Williams and St. Louis Cardinals ' Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Chris Carpenter . Golfer Tiger Woods lives about eight miles away in a $40 million estate on Jupiter Island . <p> As an attorney with nationally-known attorney Willie Gary 's firm in Stuart , Fla. , Campbell billed at least $300 an hour  --  the industry standard minimum for large firms , according to American Lawyer magazine  --  and reportedly was on track to become a partner , which would be worth millions in compensation . <p> In about three weeks , he 'll be given his prison job , working 7 1/2 hours a day , Monday through Friday , with weekends off . His starting wage , said Diaz , will be 12 cents an hour . <p> Eventually , Diaz said , the former mayor may make as much as 40 cents an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  whom witnesses testified at his trial would spend hours in casinos playing $500-a-hand blackjack  --  will pocket $3 a day . He can request the prison job he wants , but his present and former careers wo n't matter in the decision , said Diaz . <p> " If he wants a clerk 's job , and the clerk 's job is already taken by another prisoner , we wo n't give that job to him . That would create animosity among the prisoners . We fill the jobs according to the needs of the prison . " <p> Campbell could be a groundskeeper , orderly , plumber or cook . " The job assignments in federal prisons are usually the opposite of what makes sense , " said attorney Kieffer . He added that since Campbell was a lawyer , and there are prison regulations about prisoners giving legal advice , " the last place they 'll put him is in the law library . " <p> Unless he 's a cook and has to rise at 5 a.m. to prepare breakfast for the approximately 400 inmates , Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll make his bed , clean up his cell , eat breakfast at 6:30 and report to work at 7:30 . There 's an 11 a.m. lunch break , then he 'll return to work until 3:30 , then report to afternoon roll call at 4 p.m . After that is free time until lights out at 11 p.m . <p> His recreation will be limited to reading , writing and watching TV in a group room . He wo n't have access to a computer , and he 'll be limited to 300 minutes a month on the telephone , for which he 'll be charged 12 cents a minute , said Kieffer . He can only call to a list of approved telephone numbers . <p> For exercise , there 's the prison 's gym , exercise track and outdoor basketball court . Prisoners sometimes organize softball games and soccer matches , said Diaz . <p> The money Campbell makes will be banked in a prison account to pay his expenses , such as phone calls . Outsiders can contribute to the fund ; but the most money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diaz . Prisoners can buy things such as sneakers and sunglasses at the prison commissary . Also , they can buy snacks  --  Doritos , Fig Newtons , canned tuna  --  which are popular because of the tedium of the chow hall menu . <p> " It 's based on a military diet , " said Kieffer . " Lots of fat , lots of starch , lots of pasta . Then more fat , more starch and more pasta . " <p> There are no conjugal visits in federal prison . During visits , conversations are not electronically monitored , said Diaz , but the behavior of prisoners and their guests is strictly regulated . <p> " When people visit , they sit at a table on opposite sides , " said the spokesman . " And we do n't encourage touching or hugging , although a greeting when the person arrives and one when they depart are allowable . " <p> Ocala , Fla. , lawyer Henry Ferro had a client not unlike Campbell who was sentenced to FCI Miami . Alberto Gutman , a Florida state senator convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferro said Gutman described life in the camp as " like dorm life . It 's not a dangerous place , and these are not dangerous people . " <p> The punishment at FCI Miami is the monotony for prisoners such as Gutman and Campbell , who were powerful men who lived exciting lives . <p> " People are not breaking big stones into small stones at FCI Miami camp , " Ferro said . " They 're just bored .
