1 <br> I had n't been shot at in a while , and no one had hit me in the head for a whole month or two . It was kind of a record , and I was starting to feel special . <br> Brett and I were upstairs in our little rented house , lying in bed , breathing hard , having just arrived at the finish line of a slow , sweet race that at times can seem like a competitive sport , but when played right , even when you 're the last to arrive , can make you feel like a winner . <br> In that moment , life was good . <br> Brett sat up and fluffed her pillow behind her back and pushed her long bloodred hair to the side with one hand , shoved her chest forward in a way that made me feel mighty lucky , said , " I have n't had that much fun since I pistol-whipped a redheaded midget . " <br> " You do n't know how romantic that makes me feel , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to hide . " <br> " I thought he just came out of hiding , " she said , and winked at me . <br> Thing was , she actually had pistol-whipped a midget . I was there . She was trying to find her daughter and save her life , but still , it was ugly , and I was a party to it . I will say this , however , in favor of the midget : he took his beating with stoic pride and refused to take it while wearing his cowboy hat , an expensive Stetson . He wanted it right on the skull and that 's where he got it . <br> " You know , I think they prefer being called dwarf instead of midget , or Little People , " I said . <br> " No kidding . I do n't know about the rest of them , but the one I worked over , I just call him Pistol-Whipped . " <br> " Do you ever feel bad about it ? " <br> " Nope . " <br> " He died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol whipping . " <br> This was also true . He ended up dead another way , but , man , that had been some pistol whipping . She had also set her ex-husband 's head on fire and put it out with a shovel , which is a far cry from a water hose . My sweet baby , at times , could make a man nervous . <br> She said , " Speaking of little guys , " and took hold of my crotch . <br> " Little guys ? " I said . " That 's supposed to fire me up ? " <br> " No . I 'll fire you up . " <br> She chuckled and slid over close and I took her in my arms and we snuggled . Things were looking operational when there was a knock on the door . <br> Typical . <br> I looked at the clock on the nightstand . Eleven p.m . <br> The knock came again , louder . <br> I got up and pulled on my robe and bunny slippers , and cursed . " Keep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible salesman . " <br> " Will you bring me back his head , please ? " <br> " On a platter . " <br> 2 <br> Downstairs , I went to the window , eased back the curtain and took a peek . Two big black guys , one supported on a stick , were standing on the steps . My best friend , Leonard Pine , and an ex-cop buddy , Marvin Hanson . <br> I opened the door . <br> " Sure is n't good to see you , " I said to Leonard . <br> Leonard pushed on in . He was decked out in cowboy boots , jeans , a faded snap-pocket shirt that was a little stretched across his broad shoulders , and a shit-eating grin . " Now that 's no way to be , " he said . <br> " Your timing as usual is impeccable , brother , " I said . <br> " Thank you . " <br> " Leave your horse and hat at the corral ? " <br> " The horse is wearing the hat , " Leonard said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he deserved a little token of my appreciation . You can bet he 'll call tomorrow . " <br> " You 're funnier earlier in the day , " I said . <br> Marvin came in more slowly , using the cane . <br> " Like them foot rabbits , " he said , nodding at my shoes . <br> " Yeah , me and them are buds , " I said . " You 're getting around good . " <br> " You should have seen me before we went dancing . Those hip-hop steps have a way of making you weak . " <br> " We went for tacos , " Leonard said . " This guy , you ca n't get him to do nothing fun . His idea of a good time is chewing gum with a fruity flavor . " <br> " Where 's the love of your life ? " I asked Leonard . <br> " John ? " <br> " No . Winston Churchill . " <br> " He 's mad at me . " <br> " Imagine that . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other bitches and then I got mad enough to take a dump in the middle of the bed , and did . " <br> " Overshare , " I said . <br> " We both forget what started it , and we 're both holding out for an apology . I will , of course , cave , and then we 'll be back to normal . You got anything to eat ? " <br> " I thought you ate tacos ? " <br> " Two , maybe three hours ago . " <br> " I 'm not feeling all that friendly right now , " I said . " Why would I want to feed you ? " <br> " Interrupt something ? " Leonard said , sliding into the kitchen to open the refrigerator . <br> " Yeah , me and Brett were just setting up the checkerboard . Marvin , why do you hang with this riffraff ? " <br> Marvin found a soft chair and was sitting there , stretching out his leg , rubbing his knee . " I hang with him because I pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " <br> " Leonard said you love late-night company . " <br> " He 's a lying sonofabitch . " <br> " Hey , boys , " Brett said . <br> I turned and saw her coming down the stairs . She had on a white shorty robe and her hair was bed fluffed and her legs were long enough to make a giraffe drown himself . Her eyes were half closed and she was beautiful . <br> Leonard came back into the living room , empty-handed . <br> Brett finished off the stairs , said , " Hi , Leonard . " <br> " Hi , Brett . You got anything to eat ? " <br> " John lets you out to play this late ? " she said . <br> " I 'll make it up to him tomorrow , " Leonard said . " I 've got some moves , honey . If you like , I could show Hap some of my tricks , though it would be purely theoretical , of course . " <br> " Your biology sucks , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " <br> " Hi , Marvin , " she said . <br> Marvin smiled , gave her a little wave . <br> " I 'm having milk and cookies , " she said . " Anyone else ? " <br> " Me . Me , " Leonard said . " Are the cookies by any chance ... vanilla ? " <br> " They are , " Brett said . " Hap keeps them just for you , baby . There 's also your favorite . Dr Peppers . These are from the only plant where the original formula is used . We drove over there special to get them . " <br> " We were passing by the plant , " I said , " so I thought , why not . " <br> Leonard looked at me and batted his eyes . " You are the sweetest bastard ever squatted to crap over a pair of shoes . " <br> " Cookies are n't just for you , " I said . " I like them too . And Dr Pepper . " <br> " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . He drinks that diet crap . Go sit down . Milk or Dr Pepper with your cookies ? " <br> " Need you ask ? " Leonard said . <br> " Marvin ? " Brett said . " How about you ? " <br> " Milk and cookies sounds fine . " <br> " Great , " she said . " Hap , get your ass in there and get the cookies . Some for me too . Chop-chop . " <br> I started toward the kitchen . As I passed her , she grabbed my arm . " Just kidding , " she said . " I 'll get them . I was just evaluating your training . You get an A. Later I 'll give you a treat , and it wo n't be a dog biscuit . " <br> She leaned forward and kissed me on the lips . <br> As I started back into the living room area Leonard said , " Good dog . Next you 'll be off the newspapers and using the yard . " <br> " That 's my goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far end from Leonard , who had kicked off his shoes and was stretching his legs out . <br> " I ca n't see what Brett sees in you , Hap , " Leonard said . <br> " It 's the parts you do n't see , " I said . <br> " Nor do I want to . " <br> " I 'm thinking , maybe , " I said , " you did n't really come over here to interrupt my sex life and have milk and cookies . " <br> " I 'm having Dr Pepper , " Leonard said . " Dr Pepper that you got special just for me . " <br> " Go to hell , Leonard . " <br> " You 're right , Hap , " Marvin said . " We did n't come over to have milk and cookies . It 's a little more complicated than that . " <br> 3 <br> We finished up our milk and cookies , Leonard his Dr Pepper and cookies , then Brett went upstairs to bed . The treat she offered me would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay Leonard 's fault , and gave him a black mark on my mental chalkboard . No star for you , asshole . Next time I 'd get RC instead of Dr Pepper , see how that pulled his chain , maybe get some of those nasty coconut cookies he hated . I hated them too , but the punishment was worth consideration . <br> We went out in the yard to talk so Brett would n't be bothered by our big mouths . She had bought some metal lawn chairs and put them out there , and I kept expecting to come out some morning and find they 'd been chair-napped , as our part of the neighborhood was getting bad . Used to , you could leave your wallet on the porch swing and no one would bother it . These days , you left a cheese grater out , someone would steal the holes . <br> It was a nice night and there were n't too many lights on our street , and the sky was clear so you could look up through the limbs of the elm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was too cool for crickets and there was n't any traffic on the road out front . The air smelled fresh and a little sweet , like a baby 's breath , and in that moment I was glad we lived there in that house with that yard and that big elm , in what the old books about the South used to call genteel poverty . <br> After seating ourselves in the lawn chairs , I crossed my legs and dangled a bunny shoe . <br> Leonard said , " Man , you could have at least put on pants . That robe is a little too peekaboo . " <br> " My motto , " I said , " is if you 've got it , flaunt it . " <br> " What you 're flauntin ' is enough to make a man turn a gun on himself , " Leonard said . <br> Marvin said , " I got a job proposition to discuss . " <br> " You 're gon na love this , Hap , " Leonard said . <br> I looked at Marvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think you 're going to throw a parade , but here it is , " Marvin said . " My daughter 's daughter , her boyfriend , he 's been beating on her . " <br> This fit in with the theme Brett and I had been discussing . Maybe I should just send her over there with a shovel . If there was a dwarf , I could send her with a pistol . <br> I said , " Boyfriend ? Your granddaughter ? What is she , like twelve ? " <br> " Eighteen . " <br> " Get out , " I said . <br> " They grow fast , " he said . <br> " And she 's a cutie , " Leonard said . " You should see her . A dirty old hetero man like you , you 'd love her . " <br> " You 've seen her ? " <br> " Photograph , " Leonard said . <br> I turned to Marvin . " So what exactly is the deal ? " <br> " Well , he whipped up on her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he got out and I beat him a little bit with my cane . It wore me out and it did n't do my cane any good and I scuffed up a good pair of shoes . I had to get a new cane and have the shoes shined . That ai n't a quarter no more . White boys are doing it now , by the way . They like at least five dollars . " <br> " Inflation , " Leonard said . <br> " How old is the boyfriend ? " I asked . <br> " Twenty-five or so , " Marvin said . " I do n't know exactly . Old enough to be a better person than he is . Old enough for me to kill him and drop his body in a hole somewhere . " <br> " So you beat him with your cane , and now you want ... what ? " I said . " Sounds like to me you took care of the problem , gave him an attitude adjustment . Did you leave the old cane up his ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deal is , " Marvin said , " he did n't like it much , that beating , and he has friends he can go to . And my leg , it 's just getting good , but it 's not that good . I can whip one ass easy enough , but multiple asses , not so sure . And I 'm only up for one ass at a time , maybe once a week during certain hours after lunch and well before sunset when the stars are aligned just right ... I was lucky I caught him alone , without his posse . " <br> " Call me foolish , " I said , " but since you used to be a cop , did it occur to you that you might want to call the law and maybe have them go over there and do the domestic violence thing ? " <br> " Therein lays the Shakespearean rub , " Marvin said . <br> " That sounds like something I 'd like on my middle leg , " Leonard said . <br> " You see , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy she 's with , he 's kind of a drug dealer . " <br> " Kind of ? " I asked . <br> " Okay , " Marvin said . " Absolutely he is . And if the law gets involved , well , she could get involved . " <br> " I 'm not loving this at all , Leonard . " <br> " I was being facetious . " <br> I turned to Marvin . Fearing I already knew the answer , I asked , " Why would she get involved if the law got involved ? " <br> " Because she is selling grass out of their trailer , and they , as I said , are drug dealers . As for the law , they are in the drug dealer 's pocket , in there with the lint and the pocket change . So it could really turn out bad . " <br> " I probably should know this already , " I said , " but what about Gadget 's father ? Maybe he can do something . " <br> Marvin shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a point of talking about him much . He ran off when she was a fetus , and now her mother is at her wits ' end . " <br> " So what you need from us is ... ? " I asked . <br> " I need someone to do some serious ass whipping , and bring her home . If you can get by without the ass whipping and just bring her home , that 'll do . But I 'd like to think there will be an ass whipping . Not meaning her ass , of course . " <br> " What if she does n't want to come home ? " <br> " I think she will . I think she would have the other day , but at the last minute she did n't . I 'm not up to snuff . I burned myself out and did n't have any energy left , so I had to let her go . There was n't anything I could do . I bluffed my way out to the car and got out of there . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring her home . " <br> I studied on this a moment , looked at Leonard . He gave me a small nod . I said , " We 'll do it , but she does n't want to come home , I do n't know what to tell you . That 's the case , we bring her back , she 'll just run off again . " <br> Continues ...
