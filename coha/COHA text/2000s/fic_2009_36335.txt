Darlov , Afghanistan <p> <br> " That 's the end of it . " Joel Levy stepped back from the bed of the truck with a sigh of satisfaction . " Now , can we get the hell out of here , Emily ? I do n't like the look of those clouds . All we need is to get caught in a snowstorm to make this trip a total waste of time . " <p> " It 's not been a waste of time , " Emily Hudson said as she zipped up her fleece-lined jacket . But Joel was right , the temperature had dropped dramatically in the last hour , and the air had a bite to it . " Just because we did n't find anything that we have n't seen before does n't mean that those artifacts are n't worth saving . It means something to these people , this country . " <p> " Save the lecture for your class at the university , " Joel said . " All I know is that we drove all the way up here into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us seems to give a damn about . And no wonder . Most of those artifacts are less than a hundred years old . " <p> " And you wanted to find Alexander 's sword or a new version of the Bible . " Emily made a face at him . " And I 'm not lecturing you . Do you think I 'm nuts ? I know it would be hopeless . I do n't know how you got your doctorate . You 're no scholar , you 're an Indiana Jones wannabe . " <p> " You 're just jealous . " Joel grinned . " You want to be Indiana Jones , too , but you 're weighed down by paperwork and responsibility . All that stuff is sapping the joy of life out of you . You should never have taken this job , Emily . " <p> She shrugged . " It needed doing . " <p> " And the U.N . was n't willing to pay anyone else enough to risk their necks like we do . " He corrected himself , " Like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle down and write my memoirs . " <p> " No publisher would buy it . You 're only twenty-seven . " <p> " But I 've aged in the last five years I 've worked with you . I 'll lie a little , embroider a little , and then Spielberg will buy my book for the movies . " <p> " Good luck . " Joel was always threatening to quit , but he never did . He had a fine mind , but he was too restless for university work and liked moving from country to country . He 'd certainly had enough of that working with Emily . The U.N . sent them to the hot spots and war zones of the world to catalog , verify , and move the contents of museums to special preservation centers until it was considered safe to return the cultural treasures to their home bases . Not only did Joel have a Ph.D . in Archaeology and Antiquities , but he was fluent in Hebrew and several other Middle Eastern languages , making him invaluable to Emily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry her . No more ships that pass in the night . " <p> He flinched . " Maybe I 'll go on one more job with you . " <p> " Is that the last load , Emily ? " Al Turner stuck his head out the window from the driver 's seat . " We 'd better hit it . It looks like snow . " <p> " I 'm surrounded by weathermen , " Emily said as she turned back to the museum . " That 's it , Al . You and Don go on . Joel and I will take one more look around , then follow you in the other truck . " <p> " Do n't be too long , " Al said . " You do n't want to be caught by weather in these hills . I know the U.N . said they 'd cleared the area of bandits , but they 've been wrong before . " <p> No one knew that better than Emily . She and Joel had almost been blown up in Baghdad when the military had assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe zone . Joel swore that the U.N . had pressured the military to make a hasty judgment . The artifacts in that museum had been priceless , and the U.N . had not wanted either theft or damage done as a result of the war effort . It would have been " awkward . " <p> The museum had been booby-trapped , and there had not only been treasures lost , but Emily had ended up in the military hospital in Germany with a concussion . Like Joel , she was now wary about trusting any reports of peace in any region . " It 's been pretty peaceful so far . And I just got a call that our military escort is almost here . " <p> Al scowled . " They should have been here hours ago . They were supposed to meet us before we even entered this zone . " <p> " That 's what I told them . They stopped to help remove a land mine at a village near here . You 'll probably run into them before you 've gone far . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll see you in Kabul . " <p> She watched the truck go down the hill and then lifted her gaze to the mountains of the Hindu Kush to the north . Magnificent mountains whose rough paths had been walked by Alexander the Great , Russian invaders , and local warlords . They always looked austere , but with those storm clouds hovering over the peaks , they were particularly forbidding . She turned to Joel . " Let 's go back and check the cellar again . We were working so fast that I did n't get a chance to examine the walls to see if there were any cubbyholes where the curator might have hidden anything . " <p> He followed her into the building . " Why would n't he have taken anything valuable with him ? " <p> " He might have done it . The report said he 'd been killed by bandits while he was trying to get out of the area . But you know we 've found hidden artifacts before . " It was n't that unusual for museum staffs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Maybe you 'll find the Holy Grail . " <p> " Not likely . " He glanced around at the empty cases of the first-floor exhibition room . " We did n't find one display case that could have preserved anything ancient . Cheap , very cheap . I ca n't figure out why they even had a museum out here in the boondocks . There 's only a little village in the valley , and that 's practically deserted after all the bandit activity in the area . " <p> That had puzzled Emily , too . The area had just been opened to the U.N . after a violent year of bandit and Taliban activity . It was strange that the museum had appeared to be untouched by the violence taking place around it , but perhaps stranger that it existed here at all . " I was told the museum was funded by Aman Nemid , a member of the National Council who was born in that village . He 's very proud of it . He was the one who requested we be sent here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that curator would have considered an old print of Casablanca an art treasure . " <p> " It was . I liked that movie . " She was already on her way downstairs . " I know , I 'm a sentimental slob . " <p> " Yep , " he said as he followed her . " You need someone to jar you into the real world . I ca n't understand why you 're not a cynical , hard-bitten shrew , considering the job you do . " <p> Her brows rose . " You mean I 'm not ? What a concession coming from you . " <p> " Well , I have to keep you in line . You 'd be impossible to work with if I did n't . " <p> " I am cynical , " she said quietly . " I just ca n't let it poison me . There are scumbags walking this earth , but there are good people too . I figure if I look straight at the goal ahead , maybe I wo n't see the ugliness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And good company helps the bad medicine go down . You qualify at least seventy percent of the time . " <p> " Ninety percent . " <p> " Eighty-five . " She was looking around the dim cellar . It had been used as a storage area as in most museums , and they had packed up everything that qualified as a possible artifact . There were rusting farm tools thrown in the corner , but they could n't have been over twenty years old and had probably been used in the garden in the back . The few wooden storage boxes piled across the way had already been searched and deemed not worth transporting . " You check that wall . I 'll do this one . If you see any cracks , any thickness that might conceal a compartment , give a shout . " <p> " I know the procedure . " Joel moved toward the wall and turned on his flashlight . " But we 're not going to find anything . Give it up , Emily . " <p> " Your approval rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just look . " She did n't blame Joel for being reluctant to waste time here . This job had gone wrong from the time they had arrived in Afghanistan . They were supposed to have been sent to Iraq again but had been diverted to Kabul . Then there was the snafu with the military escort , and when they arrived here , the museum had been deserted and the supposedly priceless artifacts as disappointing in value as Joel claimed . Well , all she could do was do the job and hope the next one went better . She turned on her own flashlight . " I want to get out of here , too . But I need to leave knowing that I did n't miss anything . " <p> " Yes , boss , " Joel said . " It 's only fair to tell you that I 'm rethinking the hard-bitten shrew . " <p> " I 'll live with it . " She started going over the walls , first visually , then with the tips of her fingers . " I 'll just watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maybe I 'll remember that some men are willing to sacrifice what they want now and then . " <p> " That hurt . When you were down with flu , did n't I do your paperwork on that job in Chevnov ? I 'd say that was a gigantic sacrifice . " <p> " You only did it because you wanted to use it to blackmail me for the rest of my career . " It was a lie . Joel had been as caring as a mother with her child when she had been ill . He had found her a decent doctor and finished the job in Chevnov himself . No one could be a better friend than Joel had proved to be . She 'd be devastated both personally and professionally if she lost him . " Check those walls . " <p> " Okay . Okay . " He shined his beam on the walls . " But I bet Humphrey Bogart would n't have wasted his time . There 's no drama in this . Boring . " <p> " But Ingrid Bergman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about duty . " <p> Joel sighed and repeated , " Boring . " <p> " I 'M DONE , " JOEL SAID . " NARY a cache in sight . Do you need any help ? " <p> " No . I 'll only be a few more minutes . " She moved a few feet , her gaze narrowing on the wall . " You 'd just get in my way . " <p> " If you take any longer , I 'll build a bonfire of those trunks . " He blew on his hands . " We 've only been down here ten minutes , and it 's like an icebox . " <p> " A few more minutes , " she repeated absently , her fingertips probing the rough stone wall . <p> Joel leaned back against the wall , watching her . She probably did n't even feel the cold , he thought . Once Emily focused on a project , nothing existed but the work at hand . That was the reason she was admired and respected by military and diplomats alike in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had credentials out of the stratosphere . She was only thirty , but she had been working for the U.N . since before she had gotten her degree . At first , she worked under Oxford Professor Cordwain , but she had taken over after he opted out eighteen months later . <p> More power to her . He would n't have her job on a bet . He did n't mind being on the team , but he liked his personal life , and Emily had none . Every time she started to have a tentative relationship , she was sent to another part of the world . <p> Why had n't he tried to get her into bed ? They worked together with a closeness that should have lent itself to a more sexual intimacy . God knows , she was attractive . Maybe not in the usual sense . She was tall and thin , but with a grace and strength that were kind of sexy . Her brown eyes were wide set and slanted , giving her a faintly exotic appeal . She wore little makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her short blond-brown hair was always clean and shiny . <p> So why had n't he hit on her ? <p> Because he 'd sensed the fragility beneath the strength . In spite of what she faced every day , she was a dreamer , and dreamers could be hurt . She wanted to believe in a better world that had all the beauty of the past , and ignored the fact that the past had been as violent as the present . <p> No , she did n't ignore it . But she refused to dwell on it . Maybe that was why he liked her so damn much . She wanted the world to be good and was doing something about it . She was right , he only wanted the adventure , the excitement , and the friendship that Emily gave him . <p> And occasionally , when he was on leave , a roll in the hay with Maggie Nevowitz , who was cute and bawdy and not at all fragile . <p> " Nothing . " Emily took a step back . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell me why I 'm freezing my balls off down here ? " <p> Her smile lit her face . " Because it could have been . " She started for the stairs . " The most magical words in the language . " <p> He followed her . " No , the most magical words are heat , food , and sex . " He turned up his collar as they went outside . " Brrr . " His gaze went to the mountains . " It 's coming fast . Look at those clouds . " <p> " Then let 's get going . " She jumped into the passenger seat of the truck . " At the speed you drive , we should be out of the province before the storm catches up to us . And the military escort will meet us long before then . It should be okay . " <p> " Yeah . " He did n't move , his eyes on the roiling gray-black clouds . He was feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature . His chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation . It was as if those threatening clouds were alive and stalking him . <p> Stupid . <p> " Sure . " He tore his gaze away from the approaching storm . " It 'll be okay . " <p> " THEY 'RE COMING . " BORG FELL down beside Staunton on the side of the hill overlooking the road . " Just a few minutes away . " He lifted his rifle . " Shall I blow out the tires to make them stop ? " <p> " No , they 'll stop . " Staunton lifted his binoculars . " They have a reason . We do n't want to damage the artifacts in the back if they skid off the road . " He focused his glasses on the front seat of the approaching truck . " Yes , there she is in the passenger seat . Emily Hudson . She 's smiling and talking to the man next to her . What 's his name ? Levy . No sexual relationship , but they 're friends of long standing . And her attitude toward him leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're going to see it soon , " Borg said . " We should be ready . " <p> " I 'm ready . " Staunton said . " I 'm always ready . " He put the binoculars down . " Stop worrying , Borg . " <p> " We ca n't delay that escort any longer . They 're going to be right on top of us within thirty minutes . " <p> " Thirty minutes can be a long time . I 've prepared everything . It will all go well . " <p> " Sure . " Borg clenched his hand on the stock of the rifle . Staunton had ice water running through his veins . The bastard was always cool and certain of everything . " Do you think she has it in that truck ? " <p> " I hope she does . " He smiled . " It will be so much easier for her if it 's there . " <p> " FOR PETE 'S SAKE , WILL YOU turn off Bruce Springsteen ? " Joel asked . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . " <p> " You 're never satisfied . " She started searching her iPod . " I 'd think you 'd appreciate the difference between The Boss and Casablanca . ' Born in the U.S.A. ' is definitely not sentimental . " <p> " But he goes both ways . ' Dancing in the Dark ' is a little too  --  what the shit ! " He jammed on the brakes . " It 's Al 's truck ! " <p> Emily 's eyes widened in horror . " My God . " <p> The truck was turned over and artifacts were strewn all over the gravel road and bordering ditches . <p> " I do n't see Al or Don . " Joel opened the door . " Where the hell are they ? " <p> " No ! " Emily grabbed his arm . " Do n't get out of the truck . Get us out of here . " <p> " No way . I have to find  --  " <p> " You know what we 're supposed to do when we run into anything unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the escort . This could be a trap . " <p> " And it could be a hit-and-run by those son-of-a-bitchin ' bandits or Taliban . If our guys are hurt , they could bleed to death before we can get back to them . " He grabbed his gun from the glove box and jumped to the ground . " Stay here . I 'll check it out . " He strode toward the overturned truck . " Call for help . " <p> If he was going to do it , then she could n't let him go in alone . She grabbed her Glock and got out of the truck . " Be careful , dammit . Do n't go barging in and  --  " She stopped as she saw the blood . <p> A thin red stream was running toward them from behind the truck . <p> She forgot about being careful . She was around the truck before Joel got there . <p> " God in heaven , " she whispered . <p> Al was crumpled near the ditch . His head had been almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don was half under the truck as if he 'd tried to get away from the attack . He had n't succeeded . Bullet holes peppered his entire torso . <p> " Butchers , " Joel said huskily . " They did n't have a chance . " <p> Emily tore her gaze from the bodies . Bodies . So impersonal a word . These had been her friends and companions . " We ca n't do anything for them . We have to get out of here . " <p> He did n't move . " Sons of bitches . " <p> Emily grabbed him by the arm . " We have to leave . Now . They could still be  --  " <p> " And they are . " She whirled to see a tall , loose-limbed man with sandy hair coming toward her , an AK-47 cradled casually in the crook of his arm . " Do n't lift your guns . This weapon could cut you in two before either of you could press the trigger . " <p> " You killed them ? " She stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted anything in the truck , they would have let you have it . Those are our orders . We 're not supposed to fight to protect those artifacts . " <p> " But , love , I needed a distraction . " He raised his thick sandy brows . " How else could I be sure to engage your attention ? " <p> His voice was smooth , casual , and had a faint Australian accent . In comparison , his words were shockingly ugly and cold . " Now lay your guns down on the ground . Very carefully . " <p> Emily hesitated . " Do it , Joel . " She put her gun down . <p> Joel did n't move for an instant , then reluctantly laid his gun down , too . <p> " Very smart . " The Australian lifted his fingers to his lips and gave a piercing whistle . " Time to check your cargo . Stand very still while we do it , and you may live for a while longer . " <p> " Bastard , " Joel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Of course . It 's always best to keep a cool head when violence is involved . " He glanced at the six men who had streamed down from the hill . " Borg , be quick about it . I want to know in the next five minutes . " He turned back to Joel . " If you 'd been a little cooler , we might have lost you . I saw the lady trying to make you stay in the truck . If you 'd been less emotionally involved , you could have  --  " <p> " It was n't his fault , " Emily interrupted . " I would probably have done the same thing . " <p> " You 're defending him even in these circumstances ? You must be very good friends . I ca n't tell you how happy that makes me . " <p> Emily was watching his men carelessly tossing artifacts out of the back of the truck . She flinched as a three-foot-high vase broke . " Tell me what you 're looking for . You do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to doing your job . Preserve and protect . " <p> " That 's right . " She had to figure a way to get out of this . The situation was too dangerous to make mistakes . " Let me protect the rest of these artifacts . Tell me what you want . " <p> " I will if we do n't find it . " He called , " Borg ? " <p> " It 's not here , Staunton , " A short , burly man with thinning brown hair jumped to the ground and motioned to the other men to leave the truck . " I thought maybe in the vase , but it was n't there either . " <p> " Look , there was n't anything valuable in this museum , " Emily said . " If anyone told you there was , they lied . " <p> " I was told there was a very valuable item , and my source is very reliable . " He shook his head . " Which means that you 're lying . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our orders are to give up any artifacts if it means risking personnel . What are you looking for ? " <p> He tilted his head and studied her expression . " Zelov 's hammer . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Maybe you do n't recognize it by its name . But I 'm sure you 'd recognize the treasure hidden in the handle . You 're an expert in Russian artifacts . Was it too tempting for you to give up ? " <p> " We do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , " Joel said . " There were n't any tools on display at the museum . Certainly none with any hidden compartments . " <p> " No tools at all ? " <p> " There were used gardening tools in the cellar of the museum , " Emily said . " Go check those out . " <p> " I will , " Staunton said . " You 're being very cooperative . I 'm impressed . " " Then let Joel leave . You do n't have to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse . " No way . " " He does n't like the idea , " Staunton said . " Neither do I. " He <p> smiled . " But I do like the idea of getting out of here . We 've run out of time . " He turned away . " I 'll call the helicopter . Bring them . " <p> Borg was coming toward them . Emily tensed . Going anywhere with these murderers might be a death sentence . She had no choice but to make a move . <p> Her gun that she 'd dropped at Staunton 's order . <p> She fell to the ground , reaching for it . <p> " Oh no , bitch . " Borg swung viciously , and the stock of his rifle struck her in the temple . Darkness . <p> " WAKE UP . I 'M GETTING IMPATIENT . " <p> Emily tried to open her eyes , but the pain was too great . <p> " Wake up ! " She was lifted by her shoulders and slammed against the wall . <p> Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staunton was standing before her . " I thought you might be playing possum . I 've actually been very lenient , but it 's time we got down to business . My employer wants answers and is n't at all pleased with me . " <p> Australian accent , deadly words . <p> Don and Al lying butchered by the side of the road . <p> The memory jarred her into full consciousness . Her gaze flew to Staunton 's face . " You killed them . " <p> " We 've already gone into that . You 're beginning to bore me . We 've already moved on . " He shook his head . " And I 've already lost time because you were stupid enough to try and go for that gun . I do hate waiting . " <p> She glanced around her . She appeared to be in a hut of some kind . " Where am I ? " <p> " The mountains . Actually quite near the stronghold of my good friends who used to rob and pillage this area . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali regards himself as a warlord . Unfortunately , the national government does n't agree . He 's a little too barbaric for them . " <p> " Then I can see why you consider them friends . Why did n't you get them to rob our trucks ? " <p> " I could n't trust them . But I had them do their part . " <p> " The killings ? " <p> " No , I did that , but of course I 'll give them credit . " <p> " Or blame . You do n't think the U.N . is going to sit still for this , do you ? " <p> " No , but this country is still barbaric in many ways . The civilized world does n't always know how to handle barbarians , and the U.N . is nauseatingly civilized . There have been bandits wreaking destruction here for centuries . Very few are brought to justice because they know these mountains . " He smiled . " I hate to disappoint you , but there wo n't be any cavalry coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will be disappointed . Westerners do n't just disappear without a cry being raised . " <p> " I 'll take my chances . " <p> " Why ? It 's crazy that you  --  " She stopped as fear surged through her . " Where 's Joel ? What have you done with him ? " <p> " Nothing yet . He 's just been placed in the hut next door . I thought it more convenient . " <p> " Convenient for what ? " <p> " Persuasion . " He squatted beside her , and his hand wrapped around her throat . " For him . For you . " <p> " Do n't touch me . " She moistened her lips . " I told you that I do n't have what you want . Did you check the basement of the museum ? " <p> " Yes , we went immediately to search it . There was no hammer , though the other tools were of Russian make . " His hand tightened on her throat . " A conspicuous absence , would n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools . They appeared to have been used . They might be . There was nothing of value in that museum . You have to be wrong . " <p> " I could be . But my employer believes it was there before your arrival . He said he was absolutely certain it was . That makes it necessary for me to make very sure . He said to explore every option . . . extensively . " <p> " We do n't know anything about any hammer . " <p> " You 'll have to convince me . " He drew even closer to her , his blue eyes glittering in his long face . " And I 'm going to be very hard to convince . " <p> " Use a lie detector . Give me truth drugs . " <p> " There are ways to beat both of them . I 'm an old-fashioned man . I believe traditional methods are best . " His voice was soft . " Shall I tell you what I 'm going to do ? I 'm going to take your friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you think he 's had enough , all you have to do is tell me what I want to know . " <p> Panic . <p> " What big eyes you have , " Staunton said . " You 're frightened . It 's an awesome responsibility to have the power to stop another 's pain , is n't it ? Tell me now , and we wo n't start it . " <p> " Why Joel ? " she asked hoarsely . " Why not me ? " <p> " Your turn may come . I believe this will be much more effective . Besides , I 've always found that torturing women has bad side effects . For some reason , it 's regarded as particularly heinous and rouses opinion against you . Seems unfair , does n't it ? Sexist . But if by chance you ever got free , I 'd be hunted down without mercy . No , you 'll tell me where it is after a few days of our persuading Levy . " <p> " I ca n't tell you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it . " <p> " I almost believe you . But I have to be sure . " He rose to his feet . " I 'm going into Levy 's hut now . Borg is waiting for me . Do n't try to leave . There 's a guard outside , and my bandit friends are camped a short distance from here in the hills . " He drew a machete out of the holster at his hip . " I think I 'll start on his fingers first . You 'll be able to hear him screaming . " <p> " Do n't do it . There 's no sense to it . He does n't know anything . I do n't know anything . Please . " <p> " You 're begging ? " <p> " Yes , " she said unevenly . " Do n't hurt him . " <p> He was staring at her . " You feel things with such intensity . What a delight you 'd be to break . Begging is always satisfying , but it 's not enough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn , we 'll have to move on to the bigger stuff soon . Then I 'll bring you in to watch . " <p> " But we do n't know anything . " <p> He was gone . <p> Dear God in heaven . Panic was flooding through her . It was a nightmare . How could she stop it ? How could she convince him ? Why would n't the bastard believe her ? Maybe he was bluffing . Maybe he only wanted to scare her . <p> And then she heard the first scream . <p> Excerpted from Deadlock by Iris Johansen . <br> Copyright 2009 by Iris Johansen . <br> Published by St. Martin
