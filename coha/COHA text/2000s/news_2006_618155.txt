<p> Ole Miss Chancellor Robert Khayat likes to tell the story of the former Rebels football player who had a little too much to drink one night and ended up parked on the school president 's lawn . <p> The punishment ? No one outside the football program ever found out . <p> " There was a time when you could just let the coach handle it , " Khayat said . <p> That time is officially over . <p> Spurred in part by pressure from their bosses , college football coaches are cracking down on bad player behavior this offseason like never before . Gone appear to be the days when breaking the law  --  or team rules  --  just meant running stadium steps at the crack of dawn . <p> That still happens , but it 's also coming with a suspension at a lot of places . Or worse yet , a dismissal from campus . <p> " Tolerance for bad behavior is dwindling , " Mississippi State coach Sylvester Croom said . " And justifiably so . " <p> It 's happening at programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Georgia , Ohio State to Southern Cal . <p> Even Oklahoma , where in the old days under coach Barry Switzer the football program earned a renegade reputation . Last week , on the eve of preseason practice , the Sooners kicked starting quarterback Rhett Bomar off the team . Bomar , who was expected to lead the Sooners to a run at a national championship , was found to have accepted money for work he did n't do for a local car dealership . <p> Still reeling from an NCAA finding in May that former basketball coach Kelvin Sampson had improperly made more than 200 phone calls to recruits , OU did n't hesitate once the facts were known . Bomar and his roommate , offensive lineman J.D. Quinn , were gone . <p> No suspension . No appeal . <p> Just gone . <p> " I thought it was extraordinary , " said former college coach Gerry DiNardo , now an analyst for ESPN . " I do n't know that Oklahoma 's motives were completely pure because of the Kelvin Sampson situation . But if other schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it represents a very significant change . " <p> Players are quickly becoming aware that the college football landscape is changing when it comes to bad behavior . When Georgia coach Mark Richt was an assistant at Florida State , the Seminoles had a reputation for letting things slide when players broke rules . This year , Richt has suspended four players for multiple games . <p> " At his old school they used to call them the ' Criminoles , ' " Georgia defensive back Tra Battle said . " People would just get in trouble and trouble and trouble . ... I can tell that punishments are getting harsher , and that is the trend that Coach Richt has done , too . " <p> What caused shift <p> So what has suddenly changed ? Why are coaches quicker to give the hook to athletes who get out of line ? <p> Well , for one , university presidents have grown tired of the negative press . <p> " I believe we 've gotten to the point where we realize that one bad incident erases a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've had our issues , but right now the attitude is that just going out and embarrassing yourself and your university ... coaches just are n't going to put up with it any more . " <p> That includes Tennessee 's Phillip Fulmer . Known for a long time as a player 's coach willing to give athletes second and third chances , he brought down the hammer after a 2005 full of bad moments off the field and on it . <p> In what Fulmer called " a 52-minute conversation that left no stone unturned , " he made it clear to his players there would be zero tolerance for bad behavior in the future . <p> " We basically told them that this was the way it was going to be , " Fulmer said . " If you want to be a part of the way we 're going to do things , we 'd love to have you on board . If you do n't , then cross the line . " <p> Last week , Fulmer acted on his threat when freshman tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk driving . Less than 24 hours later , he was off the team . Smith 's father , Daryle , was a Tennessee player . <p> Another Vols player , Marsalous Johnson , was charged with waving a gun at a sheriff 's deputy while driving on I-40 . A toy gun was found in his car , and Johnson was charged with aggravated assault . Johnson was suspended for at least four games and was forced to move into a dorm . He was also forced to leave his car at home . <p> " We 're not playing , " Fulmer said . " I think there is less tolerance now because we want to spend our time with the young people who appreciate the opportunity they have  --  and not the handful who do n't . " <p> Since Virginia Tech became a national power under Frank Beamer , the school has also had its share of player misconduct . But things changed after January 's Gator Bowl , in which Hokies quarterback Marcus Vick stomped on the leg of a Louisville player in front of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative . ESPN replayed the play again and again . Vick , who already had a long list of behavioral problems in his time in Blacksburg , Va. , was immediately dismissed from the team . <p> At the recent ACC football media days , the players representing Virginia Tech showed up for interviews wearing ties . They conceded that discipline would be a little tighter this season . <p> " I tell our alumni that we put a lot of stock in how we handle ourselves off the field , " Beamer said . " Every day now , I pull a newspaper clipping where somebody has gotten into trouble . I show it to our team and say , ' Do n't let this happen to us . ' " <p> " We knew it was time to make changes , " Hokies defensive back Aaron Rouse said . " He really did n't have to tell us . " <p> Bad news travels fast <p> It 's a new world for college football players . Get in a bar fight now and it 's on someone 's Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed off on million-dollar contracts for coaches and tens of millions for improved facilities , know a few headline-making wrong moves by a handful of athletes can jeopardize everything , including revenue . <p> Georgia is coming off its biggest fund-raising year . The last thing school President Michael Adams wants to read when he picks up the morning paper is a story about another football player getting in trouble . <p> " There is too much at stake , " he said . <p> But presidents like Adams think the stiffer penalties their coaches are handing down send the signal that schools take off-field incidents seriously . <p> Hurrah for that , some fans say . <p> " I like to win more than anybody , but not at any cost , " said the Rev. Bert Love of Cartersville , who 's been a Tennessee season-ticket holder since 1949 . " Like anything else in life , if you do n't have discipline you 're not going to succeed . And in this case , when a young person embarrasses himself , he also embarrasses the university . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard line against athletes ' misbehavior is sometimes easier said than done . In an era of 85 scholarships and tremendous pressure to win , some coaches believe they have to go the extra mile to rehabilitate players and keep them on the field . <p> " The bottom line is that we 're held accountable to win games , " said Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville , who suspended linebackers Tray Blackmon and Kevin Sears for several games after alcohol-related incidents . " And to win , your best players have to be on the field . You try to help a guy as much as you can , but if you reach a point where his behavior is hurting the entire team , then you have to put your foot down . " <p> When the NCAA 's scholarship limit was 105 , coaches could afford to lose a few players without seriously harming their teams ' chances of winning games . If one or two had to be cut loose to maintain discipline , other good ones were waiting in line for opportunities . <p> " When I played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys waiting to take my job if I got out of line , " said Croom , who played at Alabama from 1972-74 . " Today , there might be two  --  and the players know that . Some of them will test a coach , knowing he 's under pressure to win . " <p> Eventually , many coaches discover , you reach a point of diminishing returns if you let discipline slip in order to keep a few guys on the team . <p> " It 's very hard not to be tempted to be the nice guy and let a few things slide , " Vanderbilt 's Bobby Johnson said . " Players can make some compelling rationalizations for their behavior . However , the next time the same incident happens , the next player wants the same easy way out that you gave the last guy . You might as well not have the policy at all . " <p> Players too insulated <p> One expert believes part of the problem when it comes to players behaving badly is the lack of social skills needed to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The fallacy of sports participation is that we thought it would benefit young people from a social standpoint , " said Peter Roby , director at the Northeastern University Center for the Study of Sports In Society . " The truth is that to get to this elite level they buy into the idea that they have to be focused on their sport 24 hours a day to the exclusion of all else . We 're creating a generation that is so narrow in their focus that they do n't acquire the necessary critical thinking skills . " <p> DiNardo seconds that . <p> " Stardom intoxicates some of these kids as much as any alcohol or drug , " he said . " And when you 're intoxicated , regardless of the reason , you make bad decisions . " <p> In 1996 , the NCAA eliminated the practice of housing entire athletic teams in single dorms . It also got rid of " training tables , " where athletes were required to eat all of their meals . <p> The theory : It would allow athletes to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But the reality of that decision , Khayat believes , has been much different . <p> " I know what I 'm saying will fall on deaf ears , " Khayat said . " But I believe today 's student-athlete is more isolated than ever from campus life . They 've moved off campus into apartments . They take their meal money and eat at McDonald 's . They go to class , to practice , to the weight room and then to tutorials . Today , our student-athletes need more help and supervision than ever before  --  and we are giving them less . " <p> Housing athletes in dorms to monitor their every move is n't the answer , Roby said . <p> " If we think that the only solution is to sit on these guys 24 hours a day , then we 're not helping them , " Roby said . " We have to give them the kind of values that help them make good decisions . " <p> Some schools are trying . <p> At Ole Miss , every freshman athlete must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . <p> And at Mississippi State , Croom brings in experts in law enforcement and social etiquette to teach his players lessons some of them are n't getting at home . <p> " It 's simple things , like taking off your hat when a lady is in the room , " Croom said . " It 's learning how to interact with other students and professors . It 's treating faculty members with respect . It 's hard work , but you have to do it . The easiest thing to do is to do nothing . " <p> The bottom line ? Times are changing , and players are starting to get the message . <p> " Coming into college is a different situation for us , " said Thomas Brown , a running back at Georgia . " We are still between the ages of 18 to 22 or 23 . We are still pretty young , and we have a long way to mature . <p> " But I most definitely think the punishments are getting stiffer . People are looking into it more , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished if you do wrong .
