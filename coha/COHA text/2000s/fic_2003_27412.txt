Mary , Called Magdalene By MARGARET GEORGE Viking She was carried to a place she had never been . It was much more vivid than a dream , it had a depth and a color to it , and exquisite detail that made it seem more real than the time with her mother in the courtyard , more real than the dreamy hours she spent sometimes looking out at the great lake of Magdala , the one so grand they called it a sea : the Sea of Galilee . She was elevated , put on a high pillar or a platform , she could not tell which . And all around her were people , gathering at the base of it , looking up at her . She turned her head to the side and saw that other pillars had other people on them , that there was a whole row of them , stretching as far as she could see . The sky was a yellowish color , the color she had only seen once , when there was a sandstorm . The sun was blotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Then someone came to herwere they flying , was it an angel how did they get there ? and took her hand and said , " Will you come ? Will you come with us ? " She felt the hand holding hers , and it was smooth like a piece of marble , not cold , not hot , not sweaty , but perfect . She wanted to squeeze it but dared not . " Yes , " she finally said . And then the figureshe still did not know who it was , she dared not look at the face , only at the feet in golden sandalslifted her up and took her away , and the journey was so dizzying that she lost herbalance and began to fall to plummet , and it was very dark beneath her . She sat up with a jolt . The oil lamp had burned out . Outside she could hear the gentle sound of the water of the great lake , not far from her window , as it lapped the shore . She held out her hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the being had let her go , had dropped it ? She rubbed it hard . No , let me cleanse my hand ! she cried out , silently . Do n't abandon me ! I can wipe it off ! " Come back , " she whispered . But the only answer was the stillness of the room and the sound of the water . She rushed into her mother and father 's room . They were sleeping soundly ; they did not need a lamp , they slept in darkness . " Mother ! " she cried , grabbing her shoulder . " Mother ! " Without permission , she climbed into the bed and huddled under the warm covers next to her mother . " What ... what is it ? " Her mother struggled to form words . " Mary ? " " I have had such a strange dream , " she cried . " I was taken up ... into some heaven , I do n't know where , I only know it was not of this world , it had angels , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She paused , gasping for breath . " I think I was ... I was called . Called to join them , called to become part of their company ... " But it had been frightening , and she had not been sure she wanted to join them . Now her father sat up . " What 's this ? " he said . " A dream ? A dream about being called ? " " Nathan " Mary 's mother reached out and tried to restrain him , by touching his shoulder . " I do n't know if I was being called , " Mary said in a small voice . " But there was this dream , and people up on high places , and " " High places ! " cried her father . " That is where the ancient heathen idols were . In the high places ! " " But not up on pedestals , " Mary said . " This was different . The people being honored were standing upon them , and they were people , not statues .... " " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why ? " " They asked if I would join them . They said , Will you come with us ? ' " Even as she recited it , she could hear the sweet voices . " You must know , daughter , that all prophecy has ceased in our land , " her father finally said . " There has been no word uttered by a prophet since Malachi , and that was four hundred years ago . God does not speak to us that way any longer . He speaks only through his holy Law . And that is sufficient for us . " But Mary knew what she had seen , the transcendent glory and warmth of it . " But , Father , " she said , " the message , and the invitation , were so clear . " She kept her voice low and respectful . But she was still shaking . " Dear daughter , you have been misled . It was but a dream , brought on by our preparations for Jerusalem . God would not call you . Now return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , but her mother thrust her aside . " Do as your father says , " she ordered . Mary returned to her room , the majesty of the dream still enveloping her . It had been real . She knew it had been real . And if it was real , then her father was wrong . In the hours just before the sky would lighten , the household made ready for its pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the Feast of Weeks . Mary had been excited , because all the adults were so eager for the trip , and because all Jews were supposed to long for Jerusalem . But she had most looked forward to the journey itself , for the seven-year-old had never been outside Magdala , and there were sure to be adventures on the way . Her father had hinted at them when he told her , " We will be traveling to Jerusalem by the short route , through Samaria , so it will take us only three days instead of four . But it is dangerous . There have been attacks on pilgrims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Samaritans even still have idols , I have heard . Oh , not so openly any longer , not by the roadside , but ... " " What kind of idol ? I 've never seen an idol ! " she asked eagerly . " Pray that you never do ! " " But how will I know an idol if I see one ? " " You 'll know , " her father said . " And you must shun it ! " " But " " That 's enough ! " Now Mary remembered this , but all her earlier curiosity about Jerusalem was eclipsed by the dream , still so vivid to her in the darkness . Busying herself with the final preparations , Mary 's mother , Zebidah , had suddenly broken off measuring grain into the travel sacks and bent down to her daughter . She did not mention the dream . Instead she said , " Now , as for this trip , you must not mingle with any of the other families coming , except for the few I tell you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only want to go to Jerusalemand even the Temple Ias some sort of holiday . Stay with the other observant families . Do you understand me ? " She looked hard at Mary . In that instant her pretty face was not pretty but forbidding . " Yes , Mother , " she said . " We keep the Law zealously , and so it must be , " her mother continued . " Let all those other ... transgressors look to themselves . It is not our duty to save them from their negligence . And mixing with them will contaminate us . " " Like mixing milk and meat ? " Mary asked . She knew this was absolutely forbidden , so much so that anything pertaining to them must be separated . " Just so , " her mother answered . " And worse , because their influence does not fade away after a day or so , like that of the milk and meat . It stays with you , corrupting and corrupting . " They were ready . The six families making the journey together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the road above Magdala for the larger groups from the nearby towns to join them for the trip to Jerusalem . Mary would start out riding a donkey : the youngest traveler in the family , she did not have the stamina to walk long distances . Perhaps on the return journey she would be so toughened that she would not have to ride at all . That was her hope . The dry season had begun , and already the sun felt hot on Mary 's face . It hung brazenly over the Sea of Galilee , where it had risen earlier from behind the mountains . At dawn those mountains across the lake had been the color of tender grapes ; now they showed their true colors of dust and stone . They were quite bare , and looked , Mary thought , malevolent . But perhaps that was because the land of the old Ammonites had such a bad reputation as Israel 's ancient enemy . What was it the Ammonites had done that was so bad ? King David had had trouble with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there was also that evil god they worshiped , although Mary could not at first remember his name . He made the Ammonites sacrifice their children to him , putting them into the flames . Mo ... Mol ... Molech . Yes , that was his name . She held up her hand and squinted across the lake . She certainly could not see any temples of Molech from here . She gave a shudder , even in the warm sun . I wo n't think any more about Molech , she told herself sternly . The lake , gleaming in the sun , seemed to agree . It was too beautiful for its blue waters to be stained with thoughts of a blood-dripping god ; it was probably the most beautiful place in all Israel , Mary firmly believed . No matter what was claimed for Jerusalem , how could anything be lovelier that this oval body of water , bright blue , surrounded by hills cupping it protectively ? She could see fishing boats out on the waters ; there were a great many of them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were salted , dried , traded , and shipped all over the world . Magdala fish were a presence on tables as far away as Damascus or Alexandria . And a presence in Mary 's own home , for her father , Nathan , was a leading processor of the fish hauled into his warehouse , and her oldest brother , Samuelalthough he had taken to calling himself the Greek name Silvanus for trading purposeswas the business manager , dealing with both local people and foreigners to arrange sales . Thus the big mosaic of a fishing boat that decorated their entrance hall indicated the source of their wealth . Every day as they stepped across it they could be reminded and give thanks for their good fortune and God 's multitude of fish in their sea . An east wind struck the waters of the lake and made the surface of the water tremble ; she could see the ripples of water that did indeed look like harp strings . The old , poetic name for the lake was Lake Kinneret , Lake Harp , because of its shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . Mary could almost hear the fine sound of plucked strings , singing to her across the water . " Here they come ! " Mary 's father was gesturing to her to urge her donkey back toward the others . Down the dusty road she could see a very large caravan approaching , with even a camel or two besides donkeys and the mass of walkers . " They must have celebrated the Sabbath too long yesterday , " said Mary 's mother , tartly . She was frowning ; the late start was a nuisance . What was the point of delaying the departure until after the Sabbath if they were to lose a half-day anyway ? No one ever started a journey the day before the Sabbath , or even the day before that , if it was a long journey . The rabbinical law forbidding walking more than about a Roman mile on the Sabbath meant that would waste a dayas far as travel was concerned . " The Sabbath is such an excuse to waste time , " said Mary 's brother Silvanus loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crippling us in the foreign trade ; the Greeks and Phoenicians do n't take one day off out of every seven ! " " Yes , we know about your pagan sympathies , Samuel , " said Mary 's other older brother , Eli . " I suppose next you 'll be running naked in the gymnasium with all your Greek friends . " Silvanusalias Samueljust glared at him . " I have n't time , " he said coldly . " I am too busy helping Father run the business . It 's you , with all your spare time studying scripture and consulting with rabbis , who have the leisure to go to the gymnasium or any other place of amusement you want to . " Eli flared , as Silvanus knew he would . The younger man had a hot temper , despite all his efforts in studying the ways and whys of Yahweh . With his fine , straight-nosed profile and noble bearing , he could pass for Greek , thought Silvanus . Whereas hehe almost laughedlooked more like the little scholars who were always bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Learning . Yahweh must have a mighty sense of humor . " The study of Torah is the most important thing a man can do , " Eli said stiffly . " It supersedes all other activity in moral worth . " " Yes , and in your case it precludes all other activity . " Eli snorted and turned away , pulling his donkey with him , so that its hindside was facing Silvanus , who merely laughed . Mary was used to hearing this exchange , in various forms , between her twenty-one-year-old and eighteen-year-old brothers . It was never resolved and it never even progressed . Mary 's family was deeply observant , adhering to all the rituals and religious strictures ; only Silvanus seemed restless in what her father referred to as " the perfect Law of the Lord . " Mary wished she could study that Law at the little school attached to their synagogue , the beth ha-sefer , and see for herself . Or that she could steal the knowledge that Silvanus , who did not seem to want it , had acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school , since they could have no official place in religion . Her father had sternly repeated the rabbinical dictum , " It would be better to see the Torah burnt than to hear its words upon the lips of women . " " You should learn Greek so you can read the Iliad , " Silvanus had once suggested to Mary , with a laugh . Naturally Eli had countered with a shocked blast . But Silvanus had replied , " If someone is shut out of her own literature and knowledge by stupid rulings , is she not then forced to turn to another ? " Silvanus had a point ; the Greeks welcomed others into their culture , whereas the Jews guarded theirs like a secret . Each action was the result of thinking theirs was superior : the Greeks thought that one taste of Greek culture would instantly win anyone over , whereas the Jews felt theirs was so precious it could be desecrated by offering it to any and all passersby . Naturally this made Mary all the more curious about both of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then she could tap into the magic and mystery of the holy writings herself . The two traveling parties met and merged on the fork of the road up from Magdalathere were now about twenty-five families to make the journey . Many were related , distantly or otherwise , so large numbers of third , fourth , fifth , and sixth cousins would meet and play en route . Mary 's family was traveling only alongside other very observant families . As they regrouped to form the procession , Eli could not resist one aside to Silvanus . " I do n't know why you are making this journey at all , " he said , " since you have no sympathy with our way of thought . Why go to Jerusalem ? " Instead of a sharp retort , Silvanus said thoughtfully , " For the history , Eli , for the history . I love the stones of Jerusalem , each of which tells a storyand tells it clearer and finer than the words in the scrolls . " Eli ignored his brother 's solemnity . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't written in the very scriptures you scorn ! It is n't stones who talk and tell us their tales , it 's scribes who record it for posterity . " " I 'm sorry that you credit only yourself with the finer feelings , " Silvanus finally said . He halted and fell back into another group ; he would not be traveling close to his brother on this journey . Mary did not know which one to keep near , so she went over to her parents . They were walking resolutely , their faces set for Jerusalem . The sun beat down , its brightness causing them to squint and shield their eyes . Clouds of dust were blowing . The startling green of the Galilean spring grass had begun to fade , replaced by a dun mat ; the jewel-colored wildflowers that had dotted the hillsides had wilted and disappeared . From now until next spring , the landscape would become progressively browner , the glorious burst of nature 's love merely a memory . Galilee was the lushest part of the country , the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel . The branches of the fruit trees were laden with new apples and pomegranates ; the bright-green early figs were peeking from under their leaves . People were gathering them ; new figs never remained on the trees long . * * * The unwieldy group lumbered up over the crest of the hills surrounding the lake , where Mary could glimpse it one last time before it disappeared from sight . Farewell , Lake Harp ! she sang to herself . There was no pang of goodbye , only anticipation of what lay ahead . They were on their way , the road was calling them , and soon all the hills Mary had seen from her earliest-remembered days would vanish , to be replaced by things she had never seen . How wonderful it would be , like getting an extraordinary present , opening a box filled with glittering new objects . ( Continues ... )
