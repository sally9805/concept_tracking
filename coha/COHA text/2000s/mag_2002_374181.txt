Why Ca n't We Catch bin Laden ? <P> How soon will it be before Osama bin Laden strikes again ? Let 's forget Iraq and focus on getting him before he gets us . Karl McNish St. Petersburg , Fla . <P> It should come as no great surprise to anyone that the U.S. has been unable to catch Osama bin Laden WORLD , Nov. 25 . It took 17 years to catch the Unabomber , Ted Kaczynski ; 23 and 27 years , respectively , to catch Kathleen Soliah and James Kilgore of the Symbionese Liberation Army ; and for six years and counting , Eric Rudolph , the alleged ' 96 Atlanta Olympics bomber , has been at large , happily grilling venison burgers deep in the backwoods of our own backyard . Stephen Phillips Narberth , Pa . <P> Why do n't we double the reward for bin Laden and add an offer of citizenship in the U.S. or a country of one 's choosing ? It would be cheaper than trying to get him through the means we are using now . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reward . He is probably hiding among people who do n't know what a scoundrel he is . Robert King Normal , Ill . <P> I believe that bin Laden is dead . but as long as the American people think he is still alive , they are nervous and motivated to keep up the fight . For this reason , the government will not tell us whether he is dead . Michael Trovato East Brunswick , N.J. <P> Each release of an audio-or videotape alleged to be of bin Laden alerts the intelligence communities of the world to an impending assault . Security forces increase their vigilance , intelligence communities go on red alert , and local citizens become more safety conscious . Any possible terrorist activity will automatically be more difficult to accomplish after an advance warning has been given . So why would a terrorist want to give us advance warning ? I am not convinced for a moment that these tapes are authentic . I believe they are designed to keep the flames of Western paranoia burning brightly , so that the U.S. juggernaut to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> We ca n't catch bin Laden because he has built a wall of friends around himself . In contrast , America is building a wall of enemies . For example , after receiving a message of sympathy from Iran about Sept. 11 , we declared that country part of the " axis of evil . " Michael A. Brown Columbia , Md . <P> I am perplexed that we never suggest the most likely hideout for bin Laden  --  Saudi Arabia . Where do you go when there is no place left to go ? You go home ! His rich family has the financial ability and the political influence to protect him . He could easily exist there without our knowledge . George Merriweather Ojai , Calif . <P> Bin Laden would have been caught ages ago if media and government leaks did not warn him and his followers of every strategy the allies are using to try to catch him . Breaking the Enigma code in World War II contributed massively to the success of the campaign against Germany and significantly shortened the fighting . This was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code or announce that it had been broken . The Germans never knew any of this until after the war was over . Does anybody believe that an equivalent secret could be kept today ? Nicholas Boote London
