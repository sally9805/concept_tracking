EXCLUSIVE Headnote Her husband wo n't clean , her kids wo n't eat , and she ca n't remember-the last time she got a manicure . Intimate talk about her " out of control " lifeand why she 's loving every minute of it . Photograph Happy together : Faith bonding backstage with her husband , Tim McGraw , during a 1999 rehearsal . // It was n't supposed to be like this . Faith Hill was supposed to vanish for a while-after a whirlwind year of winning awards ( including three Grammys ) and appearing in countless music videos , TV commercials , and concert arenas . Faith , 36 , and her husband , country singing superstar Tim McGraw , were heading home to Nashville for a well-deserved time-out , and to await the birth of their third child in early 2002 . Things did n't turn out exactly as planned . For starters , Faith 's new baby , Audrey Caroline McGraw , was born by cesarean section on December 6 , 2001-a month early . And rather than vanish , Faith has remained very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 11 , her version of " The Star Spangled Banner " was played repeatedly on the radio ; today , her hit single " There You 'll Be " ( from the film Pearl Harbor ) is a staple on most stations . In January , she was nominated for yet another Grammy , and Billboard recently named her the most-played female artist of 2001 . As Faith jokes , " I ought to disappear more often . " In fact , Faith Hill has a history of never quite doing what she 's supposed to do . In her tiny hometown of Star , Mississippi-where she was adopted as an infant and grew up with loving parents and two older brothers-few doubted she was destined for stardom . Nashville , though , did n't agree at first . The female country stars who preceded her were mostly cute and spunky . Faith , however , with her willowy five-foot ten-inch frame and long , sleek hair , is classically beautiful and undeniably sexy . Eventually , she would blend the wholesome family values revered in country music with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth album , Breathe , is still racking up multi-platinum sales , and she has endorsement deals with Pepsi and Cover Girl .

" Photograph 1983 Left , Faith stands fait tall as a freshman cheerleader at McLaurin High School in Mississippi . 1995 Right , embarking on a big career  --  with big hair to match-at the Country Music Awards . // Married in 1996 , Faith and Tim have two older daughters : Gracie , four , and Maggie , three . Only a few weeks after little Audrey 's arrival , Faith settled in to chat about her busy-and blissful-life . As she spoke , her southern accent grew stronger , as did her laughter , which is both hearty and girlish . The past year did n't go the way Faith thought it would , but she 's got plenty to smile about . KATE COYNE : The first and most obvious question is. how are you feeling . FAITH HILL : You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and night , I actually feel great . Audrey 's not sleeping through the night yet , of course . That wo n't happen for some time . But , honestly , I feel pretty good and healthy . Tell me a little bit about Audrey 's arrival . Audrey 's birth was actually a decision that my doctor and Tim and I made , all three of us . We 'd been expecting her to come early . But not quite as early as she came . I went in for a routine doctor 's appointment , and the doctor felt she should be delivered right then . A few hours later , there she was . It was just one of those things where we had to get everything together quickly . But despite all that , we felt so blessed to have another child coming into our lives . It 's so wonderful ! Was it overwhelming to go from a routine checkup to giving birth ? Well , the whole experience was incredible . But Tim and I work well under pressure , and we have incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you 're there , in that moment , you have a feeling of , Aaagh ! I 'm not ready for this ! I do n't have this ready , and I do n't have that ready . But you know what ? All of that flies out the window when you 're talking about another child .... I think to myself sometimes , I can not believe that I have three children . But we wake up each day and just tackle that day . You have to do that if you want a good life . Was Tim all right in the delivery room , what with you having a C-section and all the drama ? Did he feel faint at all ? He did n't , but it 's definitely something that even the strongest of stomachs sometimes ca n't handle . I mean , I ca n't imagine me sitting there watching it go on . I probably would n't be able to handle it . But Tim takes it in stride , and it really is such a miracle . It 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your life . Bountiful joy . That 's what it is . And to have it happen during the holiday season ... Actually , weeks before Audrey was born , I kept saying to my doctor , " OK , so we 're sure the baby 's going to come early . But I 'll pray that it 's not the week of Christmas . " I know the Man Upstairs has everything to do with it , but when you have two toddlers-they 're at that perfect age where everything about Christmas is so magical to them . I was just praying so hard that it would n't take place the actual week of Christmas , because I did n't want anything to take away from that . We got lucky . How did you feel when the tabloids started printing stories about Audrey 's health ? Really , I did n't pay any mind to them . I guess some people get their joy out of writing stuff like that , unfortunately . I ca n't imagine how anyone would get joy out of reading about a sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were wrapped up in our lives , and that certainly was n't something that was going to disrupt it . Our family and our close friends knew what was going on , and those are really the only people who should know in a situation like that . So , really , we did n't let it bother us . The only time those things bother us is when they hurt other people in our lives . It 's one thing to be hurt yourself-and Tim and I , our armor is a little stronger than it used to be when it comes to the tabloids-but when it gets into hurting other people who are completely innocent ... then it 's a little bit of a different story . Then these publications get a couple of phone calls and a couple of letters . Laughs . Photograph 2000 Left , sleek and sophisticated , Faith knocks em dead at the Academy Awards . 2001 Right , in concert and embracing her country roots-torn jeans and all-while performing In London . // I can imagine . Do you still want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding goods Maybe we should talk six months from now . I do n't know . Laughs . No , we do want more . We do . Yes , this is hard . There 's no question about it . Sometimes , with three , it 's like , What 's going on in this house ? It 's crazy . And our house is always a little wild . But you just have to let your feet hit the ground running and think , Well , OK , this has to be a joyful day because this is absolutely out of control . Laughs . How does Maggie feel about aout not being the baby ? Has it dawned on her that she 's not the littlest one anymore ? Well , we do n't say that . We do nt say , " Audrey 's the baby now . " We just say that Maggie 's a big girl , that she 's a big sister . And that 's really all we say . I mean , I still call her my baby . No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie 's always been so sweet and precious . But Tim and I were worried about her , about that middle-child syndrome . Obviously we 've only had Audrey for a few weeks . So , there 's a lot that we have to experience that we do nt know about . But Maggie is really sweet with her . Every morning she wants to go right in and touch her , and she tells her she loves her . And if Audrey is fussing , Maggie says , " Oh , it 's OK , Audrey . I 'm here . I 'm here . " And of course , Gracie just thinks that she 's a live baby doll . I 'm sure she wants to put all sorts of outfits on her . Oh , yes . Gracie wanted to paint her toenails yesterday . Audrey 's not quite big enough yet for that , though . Those are some little feet . You 've survived the terrible twos with both girls . Are there any battles that you 're struggling with now , where they 're concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of things  --  especially how to get them to eat . We called up our pediatrician and asked , " What if they just do n't want anything to eat ? Nothing at all ? " And he said , " Then do n't give them anything . " Sounds a little easier said than done . Oh , yeah . I 've gone the milk shake route sometimes . Even for breakfast . I 've said , " OK . So you 're not going to eat anything .... How about a milk shake ? " Just to put something in their little bellies . But , you know , everyone assures me that when they 're hungry , they 'll eat . And I guess that 's right . You and Tim seem like a very old-fashioned couple . Do you have traditional husband-and-wife roles at home ? We 're pretty much half-and-half , especially when it comes to the kids . Tim really participates . He 's there to do all the fun things  --  throwing " em up in the air and rolling around on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need . We take turns getting up at night . He gets up at midnight . I 'll do three . Vice versa . And he really gives them baths , feeds them , cooks . He does it all . The only thing he does n't do is clean . But , actually , over the Christmas holidays , he cleaned more than I have seen him clean ever . I mean , he was picking things up ! I even told my mom , I was so impressed . Then one night we 're lying in bed and he turns to me and says , " OK . I 'm done . No more cleaning . " It was like , OK . I 've filled my quota for the year . It does seem incredible that you handle so much . Do you ever just stop and think : How on earth am I doing to do all this ? Sure . And that 's why I chose not to work much during this pregnancy . With two toddlers , basically , I just did not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I wanted to do , and do them well . I thought it was time to take a much-needed break . There comes a point when it 's time to pull back and get things together , put the brakes on for a while . And I did n't really want to be onstage pregnant this time . I did n't want to worry about what I looked like . Laughs . Are you taking any steps to prevent your life from getting as hectic as it did before ? Well , I did n't necessarily choose to be that busy before . It was like , once I was on that train , how could I get off , and how could I turn down things that came my way ? Not every day had me slammed to the wall , but a lot of times , yes , it was like that . I certainly did n't sit back and anticipate it would be so insanely busy . And I 'm certainly not sitting here thinking , You know what ? I 'm going to be just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I am very excited about my next record , and I 'm very excited about trying lots of other things too . But maybe , hopefully , I 've learned some things along the way . Clearly , I need to take better care of myself . I tend to put myself last , and Oprah is always saying you ca n't do that ! So , I need to watch a few more episodes of Oprah so I can really get a good grip on taking care of myself . So that 's probably something I 'll do differently . Of course , I think I 've vowed that before ... two years ago ! I do n't know why , but it seems to be harder for a woman to let go , take a deep breath , and do the little things that bring us simple pleasures . What sort of simple pleasures do you feel you 've been missing Things like get a manicure and read a book and wash my hair ! I know every woman out there can probably relate to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife and a mother and a singer . But there is a thing called reality that sometimes has to intrude , and some things suffer because there 's just too much going on . How has your life changed since September 11 ? What 's changed for me the most is that I think all the time now about what a gift it is to have a family and friends , to have those relationships . It 's something that we all take for granted ; I know I do sometimes . And I do n't want to do that anymore . Now I just feel a need at the end of each day , when my head hits the pillow , to know that everything is OK with my family ; and if there 's somebody that I should have called or a letter I should have written that I did n't , hopefully , I 'll take care of it now . I do n't want to ever say , " Wow , I wish I would have kept in touch or reached out . " Certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should n't take for granted . I know you 've always wanted to raise your kids on a farm-are you more anxious now to really get started on that dream ? We started on that before September 11 , in fact . We actually do have a farm now . We want our kids to have their feet in the soil , to have a life with the land . They 're going to experience so many places and so many things that Tim and I could n't even imagine when we were growing up . We ca n't even relate to the world that our kids live in . So we just think that it 's important for them to understand the importance of simple , wholesome things . Did you make any New Year 's resolutions ? So many women want to lose weight . You know what ? I 've definitely got to do that . The baby weight , definitely . But I 've always hated to work out . Ugh ! How could anyone get any enjoyment out of that at all ? But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audrey was born , just this week , and it makes a big difference . I started yoga just before I got pregnant with Audrey , and it 's a great workout . I do it in a strengthening way so that it 's for more than just my mind . So , one challenge that I really hope I can stick to is continuing this , because I 've never been great at it . I just hated it . And I 've always been too busy . It was like , OK , I do n't really have time for an hour-long workout , and I sure wo n't miss doing it . Have you heard that breast-feeding helps lose baby weight ? Oh , yeah ! Gosh , yeah ! I 've breast-fed all three of my babies . It really does help . It also gives for a great shape , you know , cleavage-wise . Laughs . You mentioned that there are lots of other things you 'd like to try . Are you considering acting ? Absolutely . I 've actually been reading lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of those things I really want to do well . I do n't want to do it just because I can get my foot in the door . I want people to say , " Wow ! You know what ? She 's got potential . " Any other goals ? Your list seems pretty long ... But you know , I have a great life . I ca n't deny that . I have worries and fears just like everybody else . But I certainly feel that I have every reason to wake up each morning and be very happy . * <p>
