How does the future look from here ? The Millennium Project 's State of the Future Index helps us keep score . Photograph // The future could be a little better or a whole lot worse , according to the latest Millennium Project findings . Using 2002 as a base , the Millennium Project 's Global Outlook Panel projected best-case , worst-case , and median outcomes from their trend analyses of each variable . The future will depend on how threats such as growing nuclear proliferation and AIDS deaths are handled , says author Theodore Gordon . // Is the outlook for the future changing ? If so , has it improved or worsened over the last decade ? Is it likely to improve over the next few years ? If so , what is responsible for the changed outlook ? The problems of the moment often obscure real progress or lasting threats , making it hard to answer questions such as these . If asked whether the future looks better or worse today than it did in the past , many people might respond in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are real problems , to be sure , and may influence the future for many years to come . But there have been real improvements in the last few decades as well , as measured by life expectancy , infant mortality , public health , and literacy rates . We need a way to measure the state of the future that takes account of both the good and bad factors in order to give planners and decision makers better perspective . With such a measure , we can evaluate the consequences of proposed actions in terms of their impacts on the future outlook . We can also begin to answer questions quantitatively about whether the future is getting better or worse . The Millennium Project 's State of the Future Index ( SOFI ) is an experiment in combining historical statistics with forecasts of selected global indicators . It is designed to depict whether the future promises to be better or worse , calculate the direction and intensity of change , and identify the factors responsible for that change . As decision makers gain confidence in this Index , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national , and local levels . Nations could be ranked by their SOFI scores to determine if their future outlooks had improved or worsened relative to the global outlook , and leaders could then examine the reasons behind those differences , positive and negative . // Forecasts for Unemployment // As the Millennium Project points out , however , creating an index can lead to loss of detail about the variables that it includes . An index of global conditions can mask variations , for better or worse , among regions , nations , or groups . For these reasons , many people interested in tracking social or economic conditions prefer to keep distinct and separate the variables that they consider important . Nevertheless , constructing the SOFI requires that we collect , project , and analyze the distinct variables so that the detail is not lost and so that the tool gives a comprehensive view that is difficult to obtain otherwise . In 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 , the research program of the Millennium Project conducted an initial investigation into the development and potential uses of the Index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 countries asked what variables were most important to the future outlook , what the best and worst scores for these variables might be over the next 10 years , and their relative importance . Photograph Forecasts for Adult Literacy Rates // Based on this survey , these variables were selected to form the basis of the Index : * Infant mortality rate . * Food availability . * GNP per capita. * Households with access to safe water . * Carbon-dioxide emissions . * Annual population addition . * Percent unemployed . * Literacy rate , adult total . * Annual AIDS deaths . * Life expectancy . * Number of armed conflicts . * Developing-country debt . * Forestlands. * Rich-poor gap . * Terrorist attacks . * Violent-crime rate . * Population in countries that are not free . * Secondary-school enrollment. * Population with access to local health care . This year , another variable was added : the number of nations with ( or thought to have ) nuclear power . Researchers obtained two decades of historical data for each of these variables , then developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical data . These time-series extrapolations assumed that the future history of the variables could be determined solely by the past ; obviously this is only true when no new forces of change emerge to alter the extrapolation . To help overcome this limitation of the extrapolations , the Millennium Project also looked at potential developments that could profoundly affect the Index variables . These included : Photograph Forecasts for Atmospheric CO2 // * Increased use of biotechnology in agriculture , improving food availability , animal health , and insect and disease resistance in plants . * Wider availability of inexpensive , very-long-term contraceptives. * Increased Internet use by dissidents , criminals , and terrorists for communications . * Establishment of the International Criminal Court . * A global economic depression reducing per capita GDP by 15%. * Weapons of mass destruction used by terrorists . New forecasts could then be created for each of the variables that accounted for such future-altering developments as these ( using trend-impact analysis ) , resulting in high , medium , and low projections . To get a single Index rating for the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worst numbers might be for each indicator in 2011 , as well as the relative importance of each indicator in the best ( most-desirable future ) or worst ( dystopian ) scenario . A novel feature of the analysis is the use of weighting factors that are not constant : The importance of food is higher for a hungry person than a well-fed one . Photograph Forecasts for Annual Population Additions // The Index reveals that the outlook for the future is largely positive based on the last two decades of improvements in infant-mortality rates , food availability in low-income countries , per capita GNP , access to safe water , adult literacy , life expectancy , freedom , secondary-school enrollment , and access to local health care . At the same time , it is getting worse due to deterioration in carbon emissions , unemployment , forest-lands , rich-poor income gap , annual AIDS deaths , and developing-country debt . This year 's research found that the projected SOFI is bimodal-improving for the most part , but with a significant chance of deterioration . The lower projections resulted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists , increased likelihood of nuclear proliferation , and failure to stem the exponential rise of deaths from AIDS . The Millennium Project views the work to date as promising but still experimental . The Silicon Valley Node of the Millennium Project is improving the analysis programs to make them easier to use in policy applications . The global inquiry drawing on the Millennium Project 's panels will probably be repeated in order to collect revised judgments about the most-important variables , the best-case and worst-case values of those variables , and the potential perturbing future developments . Several Project Nodes are considering the possibility of constructing State of the Future Indexes for their own countries and regions . The Millennium Project also plans to introduce the concept of the State of the Future Index to selected decision makers and help them to integrate the concept into their thinking and planning for a better future .
