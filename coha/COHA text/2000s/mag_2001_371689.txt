Some of the most valuable residue of the Taliban collapse in Afghanistan may turn out to be paper . FBI , CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency officials have quietly mounted a crash intelligence project to collect and analyze attendance rosters , pay ledgers , letters from home and other paperwork in bombed-out al-Qaeda training camps . From these and other sources , counterterror specialists are racing to assemble a master list of thousands of radical jihadists who studied and bonded at the camps , then scattered around the globe to form " sleeper cells . " " A lot of documents have been left behind , and we 've got to get our hands on that stuff , " says an official . To that end , orders have gone out to military and CIA personnel on the ground to preserve every scrap found , down to notes from wives and scribbles on matchbooks . Yet even with a list of names , intelligence agents will have a daunting task . Ahmed Ressam , an Algerian al-Qaeda operative who turned government witness after being convicted of a plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrations , has told the FBI that camp officials banned the use of real names and handed out aliases . U.S. counterterror experts hope to pierce this security veil by showing photos of suspected jihadists to Afghans who worked in the camps as cooks , drivers , translators , bookkeepers and in other positions but who have turned against the Arab al-Qaeda followers . They will also be asked to describe unusual scars , missing fingers and other physical characteristics of terrorists they knew in the camps . All this information will go into a database to be shared among allied intelligence and law-enforcement agencies . <P>  --  By Elaine Shannon
