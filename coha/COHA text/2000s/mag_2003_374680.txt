" A Twist Of Fate , " TIME 'S account of James Watson and Francis Crick 's discovery of the structure of DNA , was extensive and thorough THE DNA REVOLUTION , Feb. 17 . I am studying biology in high school , and my textbook gives the impression that Watson and Crick completely deciphered the molecule in no time flat . Learning that they made mistakes at first , as everybody else does , reignited my interest in high school biology . MICHAEL YEE Huntington Beach , Calif . <P> Thanks for putting a human face on gene science and showing that it is not Frankenstein-like experimentation . In a country in which key decision makers rarely understand basic scientific concepts , it was heartening to think that your articles may perhaps educate the people who vote on legislation affecting scientific issues . NICK KNOWLTON Pittsburgh , Pa . <P> Unlocking the mystery of the DNA molecule opened the doors to understanding some but not all secrets of life . One of the remaining mysteries is how some scientists readily recognize the inherent complexity in the structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life came about from chaos by mere chance . Though the probability of that happening is outrageously remote , we scientists who choose to believe in the God of Creation are frequently ridiculed . PHILLIP A. NICKEL , PH.D . Grants Pass , Ore . <P> " The Secret Of Life , " Nancy Gibbs ' thoughtful overview of how cracking the DNA code has totally changed our lives , raises the journalistic bar for all magazine writers . She made the miracle of gene science appealing to creationists , evolutionists , businessmen and homemakers . Her essay is as beautiful as the structure of the DNA molecule . DOUGLAS TAIT Beach Haven , N.J. <P> Re " Future Visions " : As someone who has training in genetics and now works as a minister , I was amazed by the scientists ' views on how genetics will have changed the world 50 years from now . Overeating without getting fat ? Living for 150 years ? How out of touch with reality these " visionaries " are ! The poor of the world do not need a map of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic health care . The future your experts describe is one that will be available only to the rich and powerful . ( THE REV . ) DANIEL WOLPERT Crookston , Minn . <P> Reading your predictions reminded me of the line " If you want to make God laugh , tell him your plans . " Perhaps , to avoid hubris , we would do well to recall the words of Thomas a Kempis : " Man proposes , but God disposes . " DAVID SWIFT Pawling , N.Y . <P> &gt;&gt; Though it 's a challenge to illustrate the microscopic intricacies of the genetic code , some readers reminded us how much trickier it is to depict DNA 's outward expression in the human form . " Is that Adam and Eve on the cover ? " asked a Minnesotan . " Then those belly buttons have got to go . " An " appalled " Missouri man agreed that the image showed too much ; he declared it " pornographic . " But in anticipation of such a reaction , a reader in El Salvador counseled , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beautiful and nothing to be ashamed of . Lighten up .
