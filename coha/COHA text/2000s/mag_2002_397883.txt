With their son about to be sentenced , John Walker Lindh 's parents speak-about his childhood , his spiritual quest and his transformation into the " American Taliban " Photograph " We were always close . Now we 're closer , " says Marilyn Walker ( center , with Naomi , Frank and Connell in San Francisco on Sept. 24 ) of her family . Photograph A bedraggled Lindh was identified in Dec. // It was only a glance , but Frank Lindh felt a sudden wave of apprehension . Riding to work in San Francisco on a crowded BART train one morning last December , he looked down and saw the first news photo of his son John Walker Lindh , the scruffy convert to Islam who had just been seized in Afghanistan , on the front page of another commuter 's paper . " I knew then , " says Frank , 49 , " that nothing would ever be the same again . " Nothing , that is , except the way he views his child . Even now , his parents maintain that John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made some questionable decisions . As Frank , a lawyer for Pacific Gas and Electric , and wife Marilyn Walker , 51 , a health-care aide , see it , their son is guilty of nothing worse than going on a spiritual journey that went awry . " I would n't do anything differently , " says Frank , in an interview with PEOPLE , the first the family has granted . " I think we raised John well , and we 're proud of him and love him . " The U.S. government and a considerable number of ordinary citizens take a dimmer view . After being charged last February with numerous counts , including terrorism , for his actions in Afghanistan , Lindh accepted a plea bargain in July . In return for pleading guilty to the less serious charges of supporting the Taliban and carrying explosives , he agreed to a likely sentence of 20 years in a federal prison , which is scheduled to be imposed at a hearing in Virginia on Oct. 4 . While that may close the legal proceedings against him , the Lindh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , with a number of open questions .

At the time , Frank , a government policy analyst , had applied to law school at Georgetown University . Marilyn , who had been an aide in a home for the disabled , gave up work to be with the kids . Through much of elementary school in the Washington , D.C. , suburb of Silver Spring , John was enrolled in programs for gifted students . " Music and math and languages are so easy for him , " says Marilyn . Religion was an important but not central component of the family 's life . Frank was and remains a practicing Roman Catholic who took his kids to church regularly . Though raised Catholic , Marilyn had drifted away from the church , and her real fascination was with Native American religions . " I became very interested in their spirituality , " she says . By 1991 Frank had transferred to his law firm 's office in San Francisco , and the family moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning point for John came at age 12 , when he saw the Spike Lee movie Malcolm X , a biopic of the Black Muslim leader . What enthralled him was the final scene of the movie , which showed thousands of Muslims making their pilgrimage to Mecca to pray at the Great Mosque . " When he talks about that last scene , his face still lights up , " says Tony West , one of Lindh 's lawyers . " He says that seeing all those people in humbleness and equality all praying together really inspired him . " Lindh began immersing himself in the world of Islam . He read books on the subject as well as the Koran itself in English . By the time he was 14 he considered himself a Muslim . He adopted the name Suleyman ( a variation of Solomon ) al Faris and at 16 had his formal induction ceremony into Islam . When he 'd go to his mosque , the small Islamic Center of Mill Valley , he would wear a white robe and kufi . Though his parents insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had no problem with his religious commitment . " We always accepted his interest in and conversion to Islam , " says Frank . From the start , Lindh exhibited the zeal of a convert . " He was more enthusiastic about Islam than the believers who are born into it , " says Abdullah Nana , 23 , whose father is the leader of the Mill Valley Islamic Center . Lindh attended an alternative high school in Larkspur , Calif . After he passed the state proficiency exam , his goal became learning Arabic , which would enable him to read the Koran in the original text . He focused on Yemen , a rustic , tribal nation on the Red Sea , where a classical form of Arabic is spoken .

" If you were going to study French , " says Frank , " you 'd go to France . " But as Prof. Kahaled Abou el Fadl , who teaches Islamic law at UCLA , points out , Yemen is rife with fundamentalist fervor , which could have an effect on an impressionable mind . Says Prof. el Fadl : " If my own son were Lindh 's age and came to me and asked to go to Yemen to study , I would say no . " Marilyn says that she did check up on the country and heard nothing especially worrisome , though there were widespread reports of kidnappings . In retrospect she regrets giving her okay . " Now , knowing what I know , " she says , " I would n't let him go . " When he returned home in 1999 , John told his family he wished to live austerely and practice celibacy . His parents were accepting . " There are many priests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in robes , only black . So this seemed familiar to me . " In any case , John 's family had undergone a major change of its own while he had been away . Frank and Marilyn had legally separated . ( Frank now lives in San Rafael , Calif. , while Marilyn resides in nearby Fairfax ; they share custody of Naomi . ) The couple wo n't discuss the problems in their marriage except to insist that they did n't have an unduly negative effect on John . " There is no connection between his conversion to Islam and our split , " says Marilyn . " Some people are seekers , and he is one of them . I know that sounds New Age , and some people wo n't get it . But he was n't doing this out of a void . He wanted this kind of life out of a pure motive . " His headlong rush into Islam accelerated in the months that followed . John headed back to Yemen in February 2000 but stayed only a short time . He wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Khizar Hiyat , a member of a fundamentalist group , Tablighi Jamaat , whom he had met at the Mill Valley mosque . Hiyat encouraged Lindh to enroll at a madrassah , a fundamentalist school , in the town of Bannu in northern Pakistan . Conditions at the school were spartan . Lindh studied 12 hours a day at the three-room academy , though the town did boast a cybercafe , where he was able to send regular e-mails to his family . After a few months there , however , he sent a message saying that he was going to the mountains and might be out of touch for a while . It would be eight months . What he did n't tell them was that he had decided to become a holy warrior for the Taliban , who then controlled Afghanistan despite a long-running struggle against the Northern Alliance . His parents and lawyers maintain that in doing so Lindh was simply trying to be true to his new faith . " John was told that Muslim women and children were being raped and killed by the Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt it was his duty to take up arms in their defense . " In June 2001 , his family says , he arrived at a Taliban camp in Afghanistan , where he and a few other recruits at one point met Osama bin Laden . He later told his lawyers he had been unimpressed with the terrorist leader , and they contend that Lindh had no further dealings with Al Qaeda . But in its original February indictment the U.S. government declared that the camp was in fact an Al Qaeda base , where Lindh underwent a seven-week course in terror . In any event , his family had become increasingly worried about him , so much so that Frank began visiting mosques near home , asking if anyone there knew his son and had heard from him . Brosnahan says Lindh was asked by Taliban superiors if he wanted to carry out missions in other countries but that he refused . After the terror attacks on Sept. 11 , his mother and father became frantic . " No one knew what might happen , " says Marilyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan . " Would someone think he was a spy and hurt him ? " According to the Lindh camp , John had no opportunity to flee Afghanistan after Sept. 11 . Instead , he wound up in the Afghan town of Mazar  --  i-Sharif , where he was taken prisoner by U.S. allies in late November . But others believe he could - and should-have raised a white flag and walked earlier . While imprisoned with other Taliban captives , he was questioned by CIA agent Johnny " Mike " Spann on Nov. 25 , but he refused to answer any questions . During a prison uprising a few hours later , Spann was killed and Lindh wounded . There is no evidence that Lindh played a role in the revolt , but that is little consolation for the Spann family . " He was fighting for the Taliban , " says Johnny Spann , Mike Spann 's father . " He had a chance to tell Mike " I 'm an American . I have information that will save Americans ' lives . ' He did n't do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back to the United States . Officials say he has been cooperative but appears to know little of any consequence . As it stands now , Lindh will have to serve at least 17 years of his sentence before he is eligible for release . His family has visited him several times at his Virginia jail , and they write regularly . His brother Connell says John has recently been reading a novel by Saul Bellow . " We 're always talking about books , " says Connell . Lindh continues to be an observant Muslim , and his family continues to accept that , and him , unconditionally . " We really miss him , but we 're here for him , " says Marilyn , " and always will be . " * Bill Hewitt * Maureen Harrington in Marin County and Colleen O'Connor in Washington , D.C.
