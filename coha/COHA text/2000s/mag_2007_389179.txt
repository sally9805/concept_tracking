Headnote This year 's circus truly is a clown 's delight . DEMETRIUS ALEXANDRO CLAUDIO Amadeus Bello Nock , or just plain Bello , is anything but plain . " I never focused on being different , " he maintains . " I 'm just naturally a different person . " And how ! For starters , this is first time in the 137-year history of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &; Bailey Circus that a production has been named after a performer . However , Bello ( a seventh-generation member of a Swiss circus dynasty ) views his role in The Greatest Show On Earth 's " Bellobration " not only as a performer , but as an artist , engineer , and creator-and with good reason . Like his father before him , he designs most of his own equipment , including the uniquely contrived double Wheel of Steel , on which he defies gravity in a heart-stopping cat-and-mouse routine alongside childhood friend Nikolas Wallenda . Meanwhile , Nikolas ' wife , Erendira , partners with Bello on one of his most daring signature acts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , whom Bello credits with teaching him nearly every circus skill and apparatus . Actually , it 's two poles , both 68 feet high and , like with the Wheel of Steel , Bello and his respective partner leave the audience gasping in disbelief one moment and then exhaling in relieved laughter the next . Little wonder that , by age nine , Bello , joined by his brothers , was part of a tight-rope-walking troupe known as The Nerveless Nocks . " It 's daredevil stuff ; it 's comedy-it 's shocking and scaring people , as well as making them laugh . So I like to say " scaring them silly , ' ' " says the 39-year-old father of three . Drawing on performance roots that date from 18th-century Europe and a host of ancestors that include not only famed daredevils and acrobats , but renowned musicians and opera singers , Bello describes himself as a naturalborn stuntman and comedian , and his performance as an inherent extension of his personality . He wears very little makeup and no red nose . His very tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way since he was 12 years old . Bello , whose parents worked for Ringling Bros. when they came to this country in the mid 1950s , honors his father 's style and his own regard for tradition by wearing a tuxedo , slightly oversized , as his now highly recognizable costume . " I always want to capture the attention of children , " he asserts . " After my performance , adults will remember being a kid again . " Bello sees the circus as " never changing and ever changing , " explaining that , while the show keeps its most treasured traditions , it constantly is incorporating contemporary ideas , aspects , **25;1614;TOOLONG , thus maintaining its relevance as an icon of the live entertainment industry . Much to the delight of the audience , the Ringling Bros. show , produced by Feld Entertainment , certainly has all the requisite circus icons : an intimate preshow , ringmaster , highwire acts , trapeze artists , human cannonballs , acrobats , lots of clowns , equestrian performers , marching elephants , and , perhaps best of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaring tigers . That 's one place that even Bello did n't dare go . Sidebar The Flying Poemas originally hailed from Argentina , but the troupe has gone multi-national , thanks to spinning , swinging , and somersaulting performers from Russia , Moldova , and the U.S. Right : The hatless Alberto Aguilar joined Ringling Bros. in 2003 , performing a comic high-wire act with Bello . Two years later , his brother Mauricio came aboard and appreciative audiences have been ooohhhing and aaahhhing ever since . Opposite page left : Belle 's father was the inventor of the 68-foot-high Sway Pole-its tantalizing back-and-forth motion when mounted leaves the crowd gasping in fear and amazement . Having Bello onboard is a hair-raising experience-even for the elephants . A seventh-generation member of a Swiss circus dynasty , Bello is joined by Nikolas Wallenda ( a descendant of the Great Wallendas ) on the Bello brainchild known as the double Wheel of Steel . There once was a 500-pound white tiger named Rhino who created his own segment of the act by unexpectedly jumping through his trainer 's legs while the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tabayara Maluenda . The preshow proves a delight for audience members of all ages , as the circus floor becomes a place where individuals can get up close and personal with the performers-as well as the horses , elephants , and tigers ! The folks at Ringling Bros. and Barnum &; Bailey know you simply can not have The Greatest Show on Earth without a cache of colorful clowns who possess all sorts of talent including , of course , the ability to juggle .
