Broken By Kelley Armstrong Random House Kelley Armstrong Changes Clayton does n't do " unobtrusive " well . Not even when he tries , and that afternoon , he was trying his damnedest . He was downwind of me , at least two hundred feet away , so I could n't smell him , see him or hear him . But I knew he was there . As I stood under the oaks , I could n't suppress a twinge of resentment at the pressure his presence added to an already gut-twisting situation . Yes , I 'd been the one to suggest the run , leaping up from the lunch table and declaring I was ready . He 'd asked if he should stay inside-possibly the first time in our fifteen-year relationship that Clay had been willing to give me space . But I 'd grabbed his hand and dragged him out with me . Now I was blaming him for being here . Not fair . But better than to admit that what I felt was not resentment but fear-fear that I would fail , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath and filled my lungs with the loamy richness of a forest emerging from winter , the first buds appearing tentatively , as if still uncertain . Uncertain . . . good word . That was what I felt : uncertainty . Uncertainty ? Try abject , pant-pissing , stomach-heaving terror-I took another deep breath . The scent of the forest filled me , called to me , like Clay 's presence out there , beckoning-Do n't think of him . Just relax . Ifollowed the sound of a rabbit thumping nearby , upwind and oblivious of me . As I moved , I saw my shadow and realized I was still standing . Well , there was the first problem . I 'd undressed , but how would I Change if I was still on two legs ? As I started to crouch , a pang ran through the left side of my abdomen and I froze , heart pounding . It was probably a random muscle spasm or a digestive complaint . And yet . . . My fingers rubbed the hard swell of my belly . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise . I could feel it with my hand , feel it in the tightening waistband of my jeans . Clay tried to avoid the question-smart man-but when pressed he would admit I did seem to be showing already . Showing , when I was no more than five weeks pregnant . That should n't be . Yet one more thing to add to my growing list of worries . At the top of the list was this : the regular transformation from human to wolf that my body required . I had to Change , but what would it do to my baby ? My fear over losing my child came as a revelation to me . In the nearly three years I 'd wrestled with the thought of having a baby , I 'd considered the possibility that the choice would n't be mine to make , that being a werewolf might mean I would n't be able to conceive or carry a child to term . I 'd accepted that . If my pregnancy ended , I 'd know that I could n't have a child . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't believe I 'd been so cavalier . This was more than a collection of cells growing in me , it was the actualization of a dream I 'd thought I 'd lost when I became a werewolf . A dream I was certain I 'd given up when I decided to stay with Clay . But I had to Change . Already I 'd waited too long , and I could feel the need in every muscle spasm and restless twitch , hear it in my growls and snaps whenever someone spoke to me . Twice I 'd come out here with Clay , and twice I 'd been unable-or refused-to Change . Make it a third , and Clay and Jeremy would be flipping coins to see who locked me in the cage . That was a safety precaution-being Change-deprived makes us violent and unpredictable-but given my surly behavior this past week , I would n't blame them if they fought over the privilege . Just Change , goddamn it ! Get down on your knees . . . See ? That feels fine , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There . Now concentrate-My body rebelled , convulsing so hard I doubled over , gasping . Change into a wolf ? With a baby inside me ? Was I crazy ? I 'd rip , tear , suffocate-No ! I pushed up onto all fours and cleared my head , then opened the gate only to thoughts bearing the pass-code of logic . Was this my first Change since I 'd become pregnant ? No . It was the first since I 'd learned I was pregnant , two weeks ago . I must have Changed a half-dozen times between conception and testing . Had anything happened during those Changes ? Bleeding ? Cramping ? No . So stop worrying . Take a deep breath , smell the forest , dig your fingers into the damp soil , hear the whistle of the April wind , feel the ache in your muscles . Run to Clay , who 'll be so happy , so relieved . . . My skin prickled , stretching , itching as fur sprouted-My brain threw up the brakes again and my body tensed . Sweat trickled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toes into the soft earth , refusing to reverse the process . Relax , relax , relax . Just stop worrying and let your body do the work . Like constipation . Relax and nature takes over . Constipation ? Oh , there was a romantic analogy . I laughed , and my changing vocal cords squeezed the sound into a hideous screech , more worthy of a hyena than a wolf , which only made me laugh all the harder . I toppled sideways and , as I lay there , laughing , I finally relaxed . The Change took over , spontaneous . My convulsions of laughter turned to spasms of pain , and I twisted and writhed on the ground . The pain of a Change . Yet some still-panicked part of my brain convinced me this was n't the normal kind of pain-I was killing my child , suffocating it as my body contorted . I must- Must stop- Oh , God , I could n't ! I tried to stop-fighting , snarling , concentrating on reversing to human . But it was too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was determined to see it through . Finally , the pain ended , gone without so much as a lingering ache , and I lay on my side , panting , then leapt to my feet . Damn it , not so fast ! Be careful . I stood there , motionless except for my tail , which would n't stop whipping from side to side , as if to say " Well , we 're Changed . What are you waiting for ? Let 's run ! " The rest of my body did n't disagree with the sentiment , though it let the tail do the shouting , settling for subtler displays of restlessness : heart tripping , ears swiveling , muscles tensing . I refused to move , though ; not until I 'd taken inventory , made sure everything was as it should be . First , my belly . No obvious signs of distress . I panted , letting my chest rise and fall , testing whether the movement seemed to hurt anything . It did n't , though my stomach did let out a growl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know I 'd just devoured a three-course lunch . Ungrateful stomach . But the other part of my belly , newly filling with life , felt fine . I lifted my paws one at a time , stretching and rotating my joints . Good . My nose and ears had done fine picking up that rabbit . And the still-wagging tail was obviously working . Okay , enough of this . I stepped forward . One paw , two , three , four . . . No sudden scream of complaint from my belly . I broke into a lope , then a run , then a headlong dash across the clearing . Still no signs of distress . Next , the tougher moves-the wolf maneuvers . I crouched , wiggled my hindquarters , then leapt at an imaginary mouse . As I hit the ground , I wheeled around , teeth bared as I snapped at an unseen foe . I bounded across the clearing . I jumped and twisted in midair . I pranced . I lunged . I charged . I chased my tail-A wheezing sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my tail still caught between my teeth . There , across the clearing , was a huge , golden-haired wolf , his head between his forepaws , eyes closed , hindquarters in the air , body quivering with that strange wheezing noise . His eyes opened , bright blue eyes dancing with relief and amusement , and I realized what that noise was . He was laughing at me . Laughing ? I 'd just gone through a horrible trauma , and the guy had the nerve to laugh ? I knew half of that laughter was relief at seeing me Changed , and I admit I probably looked a little silly gallivanting alone in the clearing . But still , such indignities should not be tolerated . With as much grace as I could muster with tail fur hanging out of my mouth , I swept around and stalked in the other direction . Halfway across the clearing , I wheeled and charged , teeth bared . His eyes widened in " oh , shit " comprehension and he backpedaled just in time to get out of my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I loped along the path , muzzle skimming the ground . The earth was thick with the scent of my prey-a deliberate move , as he weaved and circled , permeating this patch of forest with his smell , hoping to throw me off the trail . I untangled the web of trails and latched onto the most recent . As I picked up speed , the ground whooshed past beneath me . Ahead , the path opened into a clearing . I pitched forward , straining for the open run , but before I hit the edge of the clearing , I dug in my claws and skidded to a graceless stop . I stood there , adrenaline roaring , urging me to find him , take him down . I closed my eyes and shuddered . Too eager . Keep that up and I 'd run straight into a trap . After a moment , the adrenaline rush ebbed and I started forward again , cautious now , ears straining , muzzle up , sniffing as I walked . My eyes saved me this time . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in the cloud cover and I caught the glint of gold through the trees . He was downwind , crouched to the left of the path 's end , waiting for me to come barreling out . I retraced my last few steps , walking backward . An awkward maneuver-some things easily accomplished on two legs are much more difficult to coordinate with four . Once I 'd gone as far as I could , I craned to look over my shoulder . The trees closed in on me from either side . Not enough room to guarantee a silent about-face . I took a careful step off the path . The undergrowth was soft and moist with spring rain . I prodded at it , but it stayed silent . Hunkering down to stay below branch level , I started forward , looping to slink up behind him . Once close enough to see through the trees , I peered out . He was crouched beside the path , as still as a statue , only the twitch of his tail betraying his impatience . I found the clearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hit him square on the back and sank my teeth into the ruff around his neck . He yelped and started to rear up , then stopped . I let out a growling chuckle , knowing he did n't dare throw me off in my " condition . " All I had to do was hang on-He dropped , letting his legs fold , his body cushioning my drop , but the suddenness of it was enough of a surprise that I let go of his ruff . As he slid from under me , he twisted and pinned me , his teeth clamping around the bottom of my muzzle . I kicked at his underbelly . He snorted as my claws made contact , but made no move to fight back . He looked down at me , indecision flickering in his eyes . Then he released my muzzle and his head shot down to my throat . I wriggled , trying to pull out of the way , but he only buried his nose in the ruff around my neck and inhaled deeply . He shuddered , legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a soft growl , and he twisted off me and dove into the woods again . I scrambled to my feet and set off in pursuit . This time he had too much of a head start , and I could only get close enough to see his hindquarters bounding ahead . He flicked his tail up . Mocking me , damn him . I surged forward , getting close enough to hear the pounding of his heartbeat . He veered and crashed into the forest , off the trail , and I chortled to myself . Now I had him . Cutting a fresh path would slow him down just enough to let me-A brace of ptarmigan flew up , almost under my feet , and I slid to a halt , nearly flipping over backward in my surprise . As the panicked birds took to the sky , I got my bearings again , looked around . . . and found myself alone . Tricked . Damn him . And damn me for falling for it . I found his trail , but before I 'd gone a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stopped , ears going up . A grunt , then panting . He was Changing . I dove into the nearest thicket and began my own Change . It came fast , spurred by a healthy double shot of adrenaline and frustration . When I finished , he was still in his thicket . I crept around to the other side , pulled back a handful of leaves and peered through . He was done , but recovering , crouched on all fours , panting as he caught his breath . By the rules of fair play , I should have given him time to recuperate . But I was n't in his neck , forearm jammed against his windpipe . I leaned over his shoulder . " Did you think you could escape that easily ? " His lips formed an oath , but no sound came out . His shoulders slumped , as if defeated . Like I was stupid enough to buy that . I pretended to relax my grip . Sure enough , the second I did , he twisted , trying to grab me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways . Before he could recover , I was on top of him , my forearm again at his throat . His hands slid up my sides , snuck around and cupped my breasts . " Uh-uh , " I growled , pressing against his windpipe . " No distractions . " He sighed and let his hands slide away . I eased back . As soon as I did , he flipped me over , still far more gently than usual , and pinned me as securely as he had in wolf-form . He eased down , belly and groin against mine . He slid his hands back to my breasts and grinned at me , daring me to do something about it now . I glared up at him . Then I shot forward and sank my teeth into his shoulder . He jerked away . I scrambled up , then pinned him , hands on his shoulders , knees on his thighs . He struggled , but could n't get me off without throwing me.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
