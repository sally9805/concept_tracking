Most critics , including me , spend much of their allotted space discussing the pleasures of art - of observation , of recognition , of making connections . But what about the pain ? <p> Some people skirt contemporary art because it occasionally appears to treat its audience aggressively , even abusively . <p> I am thinking not of the nearly unendurable tedium of Matthew Barney 's cinematic epics , for example , but of effects deliberately conceived and contrived to unnerve . <p> David Hammons New York gallery show of a huge , empty space in total darkness , with only a tiny blue LED for each visitor , comes to mind . So does Alfredo Jaar 's " Lament of the Images " 2002 , in which , after reading three brief historical texts by David Levi Strauss concerning the whiting out of information , viewers rounded a corner to confront a wall of light whose intensity seemed tolerable at first , but before long drove one from the room . <p> For an example closer to home , recall the frigid room in which Olafur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art . <p> While a certain public will watch slasher movies with relish , visitors to art venues apparently come more often seeking aesthetic equivalents of consolation or , in today 's mass-marketed museum realm , the feeling of plugging into cultural celebrity . <p> But for much of the 20th century , artists who styled themselves avant-garde , and even some who did n't , devised means to derange the expectations and sensibilities of observers in the name of a disillusioning modernity , of social revolution or just pure orneriness . But with the avant-garde behind us , as nearly everyone acknowledges it is , what excuses remain for artists contriving the shocks to the psyche and senses that we occasionally encounter in contemporary art ? <p> Two fresh examples that I happened to experience in Pittsburgh last month linger vividly in memory . The more intense of the two , " Zee " 2008 by Austrian Kurt Hentschlger , defies reproduction . It occupies , through December , the Wood Street Galleries in downtown Pittsburgh , a project of the nonprofit Pittsburgh Cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visitor to " Zee " enters a dimly lighted foyer with two doors in the wall opposite an attendant 's desk . Visitors wearing pacemakers or known to have respiratory problems , epilepsy or migraines are discouraged from entering the piece , and wisely so . The drone of sound from within the installation muffles conversation even among people standing just outside it . <p> Inside , all utterances drown in waves of pulsing , enveloping sound . Although I could hear other people shouting to one another inside " Zee , " I could not tell whether they succeeded in communicating . <p> The visitor to " Zee " enters through a narrow vestibule , brightly lighted and suffused with a thin , nearly odorless fog . Open the door to the main space and the fog confronts you as a permeable plenum . Once one enters it , the only sources of orientation are the feeling of the floor underfoot and a waist-level rope that , one is assured beforehand , circuits the space and eventually leads to the exit . <p> In a matter of seconds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelm all other sensations , and even memory , inducing an almost sickening sense of imprisonment in immediacy . Did Hentschlger have " the fog of war " in mind ? It certainly seems a pertinent association . <p> The sole compensation for this immersion is hallucinations - or so they seemed to me - of faintly pulsing kaleidoscopic geometry , fugitive crystalline figures that seemed to come from behind one 's eyes . <p> What a relief when the door handle at the exit finally materializes just beyond the rope 's end . <p> The reward for this ordeal became apparent only when I returned to street level and daylight : Suddenly , everything took on an astonishing clarity and definition . My eyes recoiled from the strange mingling of overload and deprivation in " Zee " to experiencing ordinary vision as purified and miraculous , the doors of perception cleansed , as commended by William Blake . <p> Hentschlger 's piece , in other words , delivered literally on the hackneyed promise that art will refashion one 's way of seeing the world . The effect lasted only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal that engendered it . <p> " Gravity of Light " 2008 , a powerful installation by Doug and Mike Starn , relied on more conceptual justification for its sometimes painful intensity . Another event under the auspices of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust , " Gravity of Light " occupied for three weeks a derelict industrial space known as the Pipe Building . <p> Here visitors had to put on safety glasses before entering the long , run-down vacant space . Deep shadows added to the difficulty of walking over a pitted brick and sand floor . A single light source - but what a light source - stood high at the far end of the space : a carbon arc lamp flickering , at its brightest , with the equivalent of 50,000 watts of electric light . It was as if a small star had somehow made its way indoors . <p> In the bays of the factory walls , the Starns hung seven of their very large composite photographs - the smallest measuring more than 12 by 8 feet - printed on friable-looking , but quite stable , gampi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at colossal scale a statue of the blind eighth century Buddhist monk Ganjin . He personifies the immemorial metaphoric association of light with insight . Other images , representing earlier Starn projects , included moths , denuded trees and immensely magnified leaves decayed to a lacework of veins and stems . <p> These elements coalesced into a mute meditation on light , time , growth and decay . The carbon arc , painful even to glance at but fascinating in the purity , intensity and immediacy of the light it shed , acted as translator . It translated into physical sensations the pictures symbolism of our ambivalence toward growth and our own embeddedness in nature . sbox <p> " In a matter of seconds , the strobe light and drubbing sound that pervade the fog in Kurt Hentschlger 's " Zee " over- whelm all other sensations , and even memory , inducing an almost sickening sense of imprisonment in immediacy .
