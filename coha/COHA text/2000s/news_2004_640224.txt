<p> The white plastic gift bag Grace Fellowship members were handing out at Monday night 's screening of Mel Gibson 's ' The Passion of the Christ ' said it best . <p> Along with questionnaires for religious scholars who attended and an invitation to ' explore the meaning of Christ 's Passion ' at the Lakewood church , there were a packet of Kleenex and a bag of M &Ms.; <p> The message was twofold : This graphically violent film about Jesus Christ 's final 12 hours will move you to tears . But then again , this is the movies . <p> This combination of belief and boffo box-office potential makes the release of ' The Passion of the Christ ' a unique moment in the culture . The film is an ancient , cherished story translated through modern storytelling , a melding of the secular with the sacred on a scale unprecedented in contemporary America . <p> It is a tentative partnership reflected in both the controversy surrounding the film and the timing of its release . ' The Passion ' opens today , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the same Hollywood that made Gibson a star but did n't help him make this film . <p> The move of evangelical Christianity into the broad popular culture is not entirely new . The Christian music scene is robust , bolstered by such crossover bands as multiplatinum-selling Creed . In the parallel universe of literature , the ' Left Behind ' series - a last-days saga inspired by the Book of Revelation - has emerged as a publishing phenomenon . <p> However , religion-based art is new terrain for Gibson , who has spent a lifetime as the son of a staunch Catholic traditionalist and more than 20 years as one of Hollywood 's favorite sons . He is the biggest movie celebrity ever to take on a religious movie as his personal project . <p> Both aspects of the man were on display a week ago during his appearance on ABC 's ' Primetime ' with Diane Sawyer , an hour-long interview that was the apex of Gibson 's arguably brilliant marketing of a movie on which he spent $ 25 million to $ 30 million of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about the two controversies his movie has stirred : Is the film anti-Semitic ? And is its violence too graphic ? <p> Until today , the question of anti-Semitism commanded the most attention . ( ' Who Really Killed Christ ? ' asked a Newsweek cover story everyone was taking about . ) And those who judge the son by the rants of his father will still have plenty of fodder , thanks to a recent interview given by Hutton Gibson . As for the Holocaust , the elder Gibson said , ' It 's all - may ( sic ) not all fiction - but most of it is . For instance , the gas chambers and crematoria at Auschwitz would not do the job . ' <p> But it is the movie 's brutal images of Christ 's suffering that are beginning to fuel the more recent debates . Some observers have already deemed it the most violent film they 've ever seen . <p> ' I 've heard people say that most of his movies are very violent , ' says John Dominic Crossan , professor emeritus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Who Killed Jesus ? ' ' It 's just one more violent Mel Gibson movie . But the truth is that it really expresses the theology behind it , and that 's what you have to judge . It has this sort of shock value . ' <p> The clash of values was readily apparent when ' Primetime ' cut to commercial , switching from a defensive , then animated , Gibson to William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy pitching for Priceline and Whoopi Goldberg hawking Slim Fast . ABC also was promoting its upcoming made-for-television biopic ' Judas ' as well as a Peter Jennings ' Easter-season feature on the apostle Paul . <p> The interview that aired Feb. 16 did n't top ' CSI : Miami ' in the ratings for the night , but it did come in second with 17.1 million viewers . <p> Controversy has again turned out to be good for business . The Thursday after Gibson 's appearance on ' Primetime , ' Newmarket Films , the company distributing the movie , announced it was increasing the number of theaters for opening week from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold Mountain , ' another independent film , and 2,300 more than Newmarket 's surprise Oscar contender , ' Monster . ' The other movie currently playing about Jesus ' life , ' The Gospel of John , ' is on only a fraction of that number of screens . <p> ' The growth and the awareness of the public , the size of the release and the way it 's expanded has been amazing , ' says Newmarket president Bob Berney , who picked up the film in October . ' The publicity and the controversy had already been established when we came along . But the mainstream interest in the film , even though it 's subtitled and very graphic , that broad populist want- <p> to-see awareness has been the surprise . ' <p> The film 's website - which Gibson 's company Icon Productions runs - is getting more than 20 million hits a day , according to Berney . <p> ' It is an audience who wants either to see religious films or is supporting this film as a way of saying Hollywood does n't serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there will be an audience for any kind of religious film that comes out ? I think only if they 're really good . You ca n't put out any quickie Bible movie or religious film . ' <p> Chris Sharrett , communications professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey , sees another reason for the increased demand for a supply of spirituality-themed works . <p> ' If you look at the cinema of the last couple of decades , religiosity shows up quite a bit , ' says Sharrett , author of ' Crisis Cinema : The Apocalyptic Idea in Postmodern Narrative Film . ' <p> ' All of this is part and parcel of a new religiosity that makes absolute sense at a time when people feel more and more disempowered , when jobs are disappearing by the day . ' <p> Disempowered perhaps . But in Gibson 's new movie , Jesus gets a makeover . The ' effete ' Christ of moviedom , as Gibson called him , now takes his beating like a man - or a Mel Gibson hero . <p> ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the revolutionary character , ' says Bruce Shelley , professor of church history at Denver Seminary . ' All this pain and suffering . That 's not a gentle Jesus . That 's steel . ' <p> That imagery will challenge both believers and nonbelievers . <p> ' The images of Jesus people used to have over their bed , that 's no good , ' says Seton Hall 's Sharrett . ' You have to be a macho guy . That brings in a distinct ideological take on a religious narrative . ' <p> Bring on the theological debates , says Crossan . <p> " The Passion ' is going to force all Christians - and this is a good side of the movie - to examine some of their presuppositions , ' he says . ' The vision of God that 's in this movie is rather ghastly . A pastor coming out saying , ' It really made me love Jesus , ' I really understand . But what do you think of God now , that 's what I really want to know . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're dealing with a monster . ' <p> But Crossan adds : " Absolutely see the movie . Just do n't be numbed . Because it is going to be the most brutal movie you 've ever seen . " <p> FILM VIOLENCE UNSPARING <p> Adults wondering whether to take children - or even themselves - to the extremely graphic ' The Passion of the Christ ' should know that many critics consider it one of the most violent movies ever made . <p> On screen , Jesus is punched , kicked , flogged and effectively flayed alive for nearly all of the 126 minutes . And that 's before the Crucifixion itself , when Mel Gibson 's cameras do not turn away from pounding nails in hands or spearing open the lifeless Christ . The bloodletting is relentless , energetic and in tight close-up . The sounds of the Roman soldiers whipping Jesus are amplified to the level of gunshots . <p> When you think it 's gone as far as it can , a raven perches on one of the crosses and plucks out an eyeball . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the assaults on Jesus : A donkey carcass crawls with maggots as Judas hangs himself , and a serpent tail wiggles from the nose of Satan . <p> Viewers will debate for themselves whether the violence is courageously unsparing or misguidedly overblown . But there is no denying the level of gore . <p> - Lisa Kennedy
