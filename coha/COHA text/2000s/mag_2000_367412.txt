As a medical reporter , I 'm keenly aware that health news is confusing . And yes , I admit we journalists sometimes distort the issue by reporting results in starkly black-and-white terms , without much nuance or guidance on how to interpret them . Often we raise false hopes and complicate the lives of doctors who have to tell patients that the " cures " they 've heard about in the media are still in the future . So when I arrived in steamy New Orleans last week for the American Society of Clinical Oncology 's annual meeting , I knew I would have to be very careful in choosing what clinical studies to cover . I did n't anticipate an easy time in the Big Easy . <P> To give you some perspective , 22,000 oncologists from around the world had descended on the town to give 2,600 papers on screening , diagnosing and treating every type of cancer . Where to start ? <P> For a few years now , " smart " drugs have been the hottest trend in cancer treatment . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells . In the past year alone , the FDA has approved three such drugs ( for non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , breast cancer and leukemia ) . And more are in the pipeline , because scientists are becoming increasingly skilled at designing drugs that target specific , critical molecular processes that tumor cells need to survive . Herceptin , for example , takes advantage of the fact that most breast-cancer cells overproduce a certain growth-factor protein ; the drug preferentially seeks out tumor cells in which the protein 's concentration is high . <P> So it did n't really surprise me when I awoke one day to see a front-page newspaper story on c225 , an experimental drug aimed at colon cancer . Was it the next Herceptin ? For some insight , I sought out a few experts . " I think the drug has promise , " said Dr. Derek Raghavan , chief of medical oncology at the University of Southern California . " But my take on listening to the talk was n't that it was the breakthrough of the meeting . " Nor , he implied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you know a little about the drug-approval ritual , you 'll understand why . <P> Every drug has to go through three testing phases before it gets the FDA 's O.K. In Phase I it is tried on a handful of human patients after extensive testing on animals . Researchers are interested mainly in determining the harmful effects of the treatment , not necessarily how well it works . Indeed , only about half of all cancer agents make it beyond Phase I. Of those that do , about 70% flunk Phase II , during which scientists attempt to find out whether the drug actually does what it is supposed to do . <P> Only after the drug survives Phase III should you really start paying attention . During this phase , the treatment is tried on at least 300 patients , and researchers look to see if it works better than existing therapies . By then , too , side effects are known , any claims of good results are much more reliable , and chances of FDA approval are much higher . As it happens , the front-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showed benefit in just 8 of 40 patients . <P> So keep in mind that headlines are a good way to see what 's new in cancer care , but read carefully before getting too excited about a new therapy . Look for hints of how far along the drug is : for example , how many patients are taking it . You might find that it 's not quite ready for prime time .
