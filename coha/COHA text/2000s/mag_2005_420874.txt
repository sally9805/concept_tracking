From hiring a coach to selecting a franchise quarterback , through a videotape scandal and the tragic loss of a player , this is the inside story of the 49ers ' restoration By Paul Attner // The 49ers ' owner stands in the middle of the locker room , carrying a football . " A lot of you were here last year , but there is one guy who was n't , " says John York . He hands the football to his new coach , and the players cheer as Mike Nolan holds it high . They close in , raise up their arms as one , reaching to touch the ball . It is a sweet moment-a moment 240 days in the making . In the context of a season , of course , one victory can be buried by weeks of decline . But for a franchise once so majestic that all others stood jealous , admiring its five Super Bowl trophies , even this season-opening 28-25 victory over the Rams last Sunday is one to relish . It is joy for a franchise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked structure , direction or strong leadership-a joke of a place with an awful stadium and weak ownership . This was a team stripped of playmakers and hope , without a general manager , coach , president , personnel director or any veteran front office football sage . And now a win . But it is more than that . It is a team mostly young but with an unlikely maturity grown from an offseason like none other-an offseason marred by fallout from news that a club official had produced a racially and culturally offensive in-house videotape ; an offseason turned tragic by the nightmare of watching teammate Thomas Herrion die in the locker room after a preseason game . It was almost more than they all could take . " You think of what these guys have been through-so much , it 's hard for anyone to understand . It seems like five seasons already , " says Nolan , sitting alone 90 minutes after the game . " I am so happy for them . " It is mid-January when York identifies Nolan as the coach he hopes can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intimate look at what has happened since then , an extraordinary 240 days for a franchise wanting so desperately to become dominant again . The hiring John York and Mike Nolan laugh about it now , how the new coach of the 49ers came so close to never being the coach . Nolan had done poorly in an NFL- produced interview tape , and York wants to drop him from a list of candidates that included Jim Schwartz and Mike Heimerdinger , both of the Titans , Romeo Crennel of the Patriots and Tim Lewis of the Giants . But York 's son , Jed , 24 , and Paraag Marathe , 28 , a Stanford MBA and soon to be 49ers cap guru , are intrigued by Nolan and persuade York to keep him on the list . This is a hire York must get right . In 2003 , when the 49ers last needed a coach , general manager Terry Donahue conducted the search without help , and he chose Dennis Erickson . But now both have been fired and York , who owns the team with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit himself . At his behest , Marathe already had culled a pool of candidates by first identifying the NFL 's 10 most successful coaches over the past 20 years and then determining common characteristics , which are used to compile a group of possibilities . From those , five are chosen . Photograph The first evidence of the re-emergence of the 49ers , a process 240 days in the making , was their win Sunday . Photograph The first evidence of the re-emergence of the 49ers , a process 240 days in the making , was their win Sunday . // During York 's six years in charge , the 49ers have gradually disintegrated . He came in believing the franchise was like any of his other businesses . " It was a mistake , " he says . Football , he finds , is n't a normal business , not with all the fan interest and media scrutiny . Then he errs again by firing coach Steve Mariucci after winning the NFC West in 2002 . He is savaged regularly in the local media , which dismisses him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in showing that York has learned , that he can turn the 49ers into winners again . " I do n't agree with what is said about me , " he says , " but nothing will change until we win . " On January 13 , Nolan , the Ravens ' defensive coordinator , has a dazzling interview . " He 's on an expressway going 70 miles an hour , " says York . " The others sometimes hit a bump and wander off , but not Mike . He 's figured out how to pave the road all the way . " Even after 18 years in the league , Nolan , 46 , has never lusted after a head coaching job . But almost from the minute the 49ers contact him , this seems right . Some of it is because his dad , Dick , coached the club from 1968-75 , winning three division titles . But even more , it 's because of his own experiences . He has carefully developed beliefs about how to build a strong team around three basics : personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . An hour after another interview on January 16 , Nolan is offered the job . He and his wife , Kathy , travel the next day to Youngstown , Ohio , where the Yorks live . After a family meal , Nolan and York discuss the coach 's contract . At dinner before his first interview , Nolan had aggressively questioned York about his reputation for being cheap and difficult . Nolan wants to know how York will fix the 49ers ; he is told the Yorks will spend what it takes , even family money , to get it right . Now , they disagree about two sections of the contract , including one that gives York say over the last eight spots on the final roster . Nolan argues this cuts into his authority and ability to succeed . By 2 a.m. , the two fix their differences . " I found out right then he was serious about wanting this to work , " says Nolan . Nolan already has convinced York about something else . He wants to be the voice of the franchise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York agrees . This now will be the coach 's show . The early days A few hours after his introductory press conference on January 19 , Mike Nolan walks into the head coach 's office . This is where Bill Walsh and George Seifert and Steve Mariucci once sat ; even the furniture has n't changed . It hits him . " This is a really big job , " he thinks . Something else . " This furniture is really , really old . " By the start of training camp , the furniture is gone amid an office redecoration . In three months , Nolan will make the first pick in the draft . But on this day , there 's no one in charge of personnel , no assistant coaches . And York has decided not to hire a general manager . He 's tired of front office bickering , and he admires how the Eagles and Patriots have succeeded splendidly with a coach-and-personnel director setup . But Nolan has final say over all personnel decisions , including the draft . In essence , he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well before training camp , Nolan was telling his players their goal was to win the NFC West-something his father accomplished three times . // Two weeks later , Scot McCloughan , 34 , is given player personnel responsibilities , reporting directly to York . Previously the Seahawks ' director of college scouting , McCloughan is a protege of Ron Wolf 's and , like Nolan , the son of a football guy . His dad , Kent , played for the Raiders and still is a scout . Nolan and McCloughan have met once , at Scot 's interview ; now they have the difficult challenge of developing a relationship amid the pressure of making that No. 1 choice . York signs off on Nolan 's plan to methodically rebuild the roster . " You can take the junior college approach and bring in lots of pretty girls and never get it right , or you can be smarter , " Nolan says . " In this league , if you do it right , you can get it done pretty rapidly . " The 49ers have cap room but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennings and defensive end Marques Douglas . Nolan also wo n't blindly purge a roster woefully lacking in depth and stars . Instead , he will gradually add his kind of player : smart , tough , passionate , caring about teammates . He keeps calling it his vision ; it 's what drives him . For now , improvement will come from strong coaching and from players he finds are more skillful than he first thought . Photograph The weight of the franchise eventually will be on Smith 's shoulders , but not until Nolan believes he 's ready . Photograph The weight of the franchise eventually will be on Smith 's shoulders , but not until Nolan believes he 's ready . // Nolan is not a sexy hire . He knows critics wanted Pete Carroll or Mike Holmgren . Nor is he imposing . At 5-11 , 175 pounds , he is wiry thin and softly handsome . Dan Reeves , who first brought him into the league as a Broncos assistant , once told him he should go to Hollywood . He is genuine , intense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent . And he hates the hypocrisy of his profession . But he also laughs easily and frequently at himself . His marriage is particularly neat . He and Kathy are affectionate and complementary . Warm and caring , she bakes cookies for the coaches every Tuesday and organizes lunches for their wives . He takes on very little without discussing it with her first . He has few friends , trusts few people . That 's why it 's important to have Mike Singletary , the former Bears great who was the Ravens ' linebackers coach , as assistant head coach . Singletary is someone he can lean on . Trust is also why Nolan hires his sister Nancy to be his administrative aide . More than anything , he loves leading . " I like being in charge , making decisions ; 1 really do , " he says . He is the strong leader the team has lacked . And to York 's surprise , he also wants to be aware of all nonfootball aspects of the franchise . Nolan takes six weeks to hire a staff ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it 's essential that his roster of mostly young players is guided by quality teachers . He changes the conditioning program , dropping machines for free weights and installing veteran Johnny Parker to run it . Under Erickson , this was an undisciplined squad with few rules and little direction ; Parker will hand the 49ers their first taste of a demanding , structured environment . Something else , too ; Nolan still ca n't figure out the keypad that is used to get into the coaches ' parking area . Photograph Herrion ( 72 ) was a guard low on the depth chart , but his death had a profound impact on the team . // The draft becomes the first major test of the working relationship between Nolan and McCIoughan . In March , Nolan identifies Utah quarterback Alex Smith as the probable No. 1 choice . Smith is not unanimously considered an elite player , and they debate the selection for weeks before ultimately picking him . Donahue had drafted horribly , so it 's also essential the team receives a transfusion of young talent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his preparation is apparent during the draft ; he is organized , confident and unrattled by Nolan 's constant questioning . Nine of his 11 choices make the final roster . The videotape On June 1 , the San Francisco Chronicle publishes a story about a videotape produced the previous year by Kirk Reynolds , the 49ers ' well-respected public relations director . The tape , viewed by the players in August 2004 for media relations training , is bawdy and distasteful , including scenes of partially naked women and caricature depictions of gays and Chinese-Americans . In culturally diverse San Francisco , the video becomes a RR. disaster for the 49ers . The Yorks , who issue an immediate apology , are criticized relentlessly in the local media . For the franchise , it is shocking that the tape was made and that no executive knew about or stopped it . For Nolan , the tape and its fallout are both difficult and challenging . A devout Catholic who taught his four kids verses from the Bible , he is disgusted by the video and troubled by internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was produced on Erickson 's watch , Nolan is left to answer questions about it . It pains him to see the 49ers being ridiculed again , negating all the goodwill generated since his hiring . And so much has gone right , including the successful draft . Even his first formal meeting with the players , at the start of an April minicamp , is a triumph . He announces a target : Win the NFC West . It seems an audacious goal for a 2-14 team , but he needs to focus the players forward . " A lot of guys did n't care on Sundays last year ; you could tell guys had basically given up , " says fullback Fred Beasley . " He 's given us responsibility . That 's what we missed the last two seasons . " Photograph Reynolds " training video , made a year before , was an embarrassment to the new regime .

He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle corporate affairs . Nolan is influential in the hiring of Aaron Salkin , a former Falcons public relations director , to replace Reynolds . Nolan wants to fill the front office with football guys who understand how to be professional and build a winner . " I find the tape distasteful and not representative of how my wife or I believe , " says York . " We are beyond the negative part . It 's not the way we are now . Mike being here only makes my job easier because we have one and the same message . " Thomas Herrion Minutes after their August 20 exhibition game in Denver , the 49ers gather in the locker room to recite the Lord 's Prayer . They end with " Amen . " And Thomas Herrion , a guard with practice-squad aspirations , ( alls to the ground in a seizure . His teammates scream for the trainer . Medical personnel turn the locker room into an ER unit . York , a pathologist , helps cut away his uniform . Some 49ers pray ; others yell encouragement : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They look on , disbelieving , as doctors use a defibrillator to try to start his heart . The heart monitor does n't change . He is removed on a stretcher for a local hospital . Later , before they fly home , the players assemble in a hangar at the airport . " Thomas has passed away , " Nolan tells them . Herrion was 23 . An autopsy later reveals he had heart disease . Everyone is grieving , many are in shock . It is a team on the emotional brink , in need of guidance and strong leadership . What follows is a remarkable week of compassion and emotion and empathy . The players receive grief counseling . They ask questions of the doctor who administered to Herrion in the locker room . They attend a private memorial service , where guard Eric Heitmann , a trained pianist , plays an original composition and receiver Otis Amey performs an original rap song . Sobs fill the church . Throughout the days after Herrion 's passing , Nolan tries to think like a parent , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think what happened and the way it happened , we were at the bottom of the barrel , " says Jennings , the left tackle . " As a group , you can either go up or go down . We had no choice but go up . " On Friday , the 49ers beat the Titans at home in the third exhibition game and assemble in the locker room . They say the Lord 's Prayer . Nolan hesitates before starting . The next day , a contingent of 49ers flies to the funeral in Fort Worth . The players volunteer to pay for the funeral ; York says he will handle it . " We have definitely seen Coach 's efforts to be straight and honest with us in his decisions , and how he handled the tragedy of Thomas Herrion really impressed me , " says safety Tony Parrish . " But it 's all surreal now . Did it really happen ? Were we really there ? " Amid all this , Nolan must deal with a football situation . Just before camp , Marathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to terms with Smith , who signs a six-year deal covering 70 pages and 17 addendums that could earn him $57 million . But in the first two preseason games , Smith struggles as a starter and Tim Rattay , last year 's No. 1 , excels in his relief . It 's obvious Smith is n't ready . Nolan meets with both individually and tells them that even if Rattay is benched during a game , he will remain the starter . There will be no quick switch . When Smith eventually does take over , Nolan wants him to realize he also will benefit from this stability . Photograph Johnnie Morion 's catch and Bryant Young 's salute to the fans were signs of Nolan 's successful coaching debut-but he knows he still has much work to do . // Nolan knows no one thinks his team will be any good . One ranking of individual players has few 49ers among the top 60 at any position . " That 's OK , " he says a couple of days before the Rams game . " I feel we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Thomas , has made us stronger . I have n't even talked to them much this week . They know what they have to do . " No one knows what sustained effect the death of Herrion will have on the team 's emotions . His locker remains untouched , a daily reminder of the loss . A decal with his number is on the back of every helmet . " It is amazing how tragedy can pull people so close , but that 's what has happened to us , " says Jennings . " Thomas will always be part of this team . We know he is in our hearts . We wo n't forget him . " The game Dick Nolan is n't at the opener . He is in the early stages of Alzheimer 's disease and does n't travel well . His slow deterioration affects his son . Mike stumbles to explain his own mental state with all that has happened . But it helped that he and Kathy slipped away the previous weekend for an afternoon near the ocean . The 49ers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets available for this one until late in the week . York pays $2 million for a preseason marketing campaign linking past glories with Nolan 's presence ; he knows the fans are saying , " Improve the product . " That 's why he also underwrote the costs of a pro personnel department . " Did n't 1 say I would spend what it takes ? " he says . Minutes before kickoff , Nolan thinks of his father . The night before , his brother gave him his dad 's 1956 NFL championship ring , won as a member of the Giants , and now Mike has it on his finger . It has been 30 years since a Nolan-coached 49ers team won at home ; his dad would have loved this one . These 49ers hold the Rams to just four field goals through three quarters and get two touchdown passes from Rattay , a 75-yard punt return for a score from Amey and an emotional interception in the final minute from safety Mike Adams to end the Rams effort to tie or win the game . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trick offensive plays ; they 'll keep future opponents guessing . For those who were part of the 2-14 embarrassment , it is a wonderful day , a step toward that NFC West title . For York , it is a smile . " It 's wonderful , " he says . For Nolan , it is confirmation of preparation and belief in his players . For Jennings , it is more . " Thomas was everywhere out there today , " he says . " He 's probably upstairs cheering his ass off for us . " Next is Philadelphia . " Got to go to work , " says Nolan , finally heading for the shower . Sidebar Good starts in San Fran have not been abundant Mike Nolan should find some comfort in a study of the 49ers ' coaching history . In his first year as head coach , Bill Walsh compiled a 2-14 record , same as the previous season . But by 1981 he had won Super Bowl 16 . Nolan 's dad , Dick , had a 7-6-1 first season in 1968. - P.A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
