1 . <br> The day begins wrong . Melvin feels it upon waking , as though he has slipped his right foot into his left shoe and must shuffle along with a wrong-footed feeling all day . That today is Christmas Eve brings no comfort at all . <br> It is not the first morning to begin this way . Throughout his forty-five years , Melvin Vallara has periodically awakened to a nuisance in his stomach , an inner itch of ill portent that could bode anything from a bee sting to a gruesome bull-on-bus accident . Both events occurred on his seventh birthday , and he still has not forgotten that bull , how it bounced on its back before landing on its side . <br> This is what the Bible says : I tell you the truth . . . no prophet is accepted in his hometown . Nor , Melvin would add , in his own family . His mother believes that the inner itch has more to do with gas than foresight , and like her mother before her , Ammachi calls upon an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goo from the boiled grounds of a medicinal root , while her granddaughter Linno watches from the doorway of the kitchen . <br> " Which root ? " Linno asks . <br> " The name , I do n't remember . A multipurpose root , " Ammachi decides , borrowing an English phrase she heard from a Stain-Off ! commercial , one in which a cartoon soap sud possessed eyes and a smile . <br> Linno delivers the bowl of multipurpose root goo to her father , who is draped across his bed , an arm over his eyes . When he sees the bowl , he responds by turning away , onto his side . He is a man of few words , but clearly he and the goo have met before . <br> Linno believes . She is thirteen and dutiful , convinced that part of her duty is to champion her father 's prophecies , even though he lacks the frothy beard and brooding of biblical prophets and his name falls short of the weight and might of an Elijah or a Mohammed . In fact , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight , balding , his forehead growing longer by the year . Linno tries to make up for the little attention he gets by bestowing as much as she can , so she supports his decision to stay home from morning Mass . She also hopes that Ammachi might let her support him from home . <br> It is not to be . In the end , Linno leaves along with the rest of the family and returns from church to find Melvin still asleep , his hands in fists by his face , as if to pummel ill fortune away . <br> But then , there is the Entertainment to consider . <br> Melvin forgot to purchase the Entertainment from the Fancy Shoppe the day before , and now here they are  --  Linno and her younger sister , Anju  --  home from morning Mass with less than sixteen hours until midnight Mass , and no Entertainment ? Unacceptable . Unfair . The Entertainment is tradition , a promise upon waking , a beautiful , blinding answer to the holy punishments of morning . Without the Entertainment , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to house , proud as roosters in their red mufflers , belting melodies and collecting church donations all through the night . <br> Late afternoon breezes swell the sun-gilded trees that lift and sigh , sifting the light between their branches . There is still time left in the day to visit the Fancy Shoppe , if Melvin can be persuaded . Ammachi refuses to go back out once she has unpinned the Christmas brooch from her shoulder , a brass dove that she nests in its velvet-lined case , where it will remain until next Christmas Eve . She removes the embroidered shawl draped over her shoulder and goes about the house in the white chatta and mundu that all Syrian Christian women used to wear , so few now still starching their blouses and pleating their wraps despite the patterned profusion of saris surrounding them . <br> Her brow still furrowed from the severity of her worship , she sits in a white plastic chair , her eyes closed , her swollen , lotioned ankles perched on the daybed across from her as Linno reads aloud from the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district politics , lambasting corrupt politicians as if they are standing before her , a row of sulking children . But lately , large-scale developments have been attracting her rebuke , particularly new plans for the construction of a national highway , a network of roads and bridges , three to six lanes thick , that will send vehicles speeding from Kashmir to Bangalore , and west to east in a third of the usual time . " With double the waste , " Ammachi warns . Examining the map , the dark passages splayed across the country , she rejects its unpronounceable given name  --  the Golden Quadrilateral  --  and coins it instead " the Golden Colon . " <br> During Ammachi 's indictments , Linno sketches her grandmother along the margins of the newspaper , paying special attention to her bun , a silver-gray swirl that maintains its integrity without help from a single hairpin . These sketches interest Melvin more than the news itself , so much so that he neatly tears out and saves his favorites . Gracie , his wife , used to tease that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a souvenir . He is sure that had Gracie lived to see these sketches , she would have saved them as well . They seem to belong to the hand of someone much older , who understands not only the anatomy of the face but the way muscles hold emotion , the way eyes possess life . He keeps the drawings in a faded cigarillo box that bears the face of a mustached white man on the lid . <br> While Linno draws Ammachi , Anju follows her father through the bedroom , the sitting room , and even hovers around the outhouse , reciting in English from the Book of Isaiah as he does his business . At nine years old , Anju is a valiant Bible Bowler , her brain an unbeatable vault of Scripture that she draws upon to give herself authority , even when faced with a sighing audience . Unlike Linno , Anju will not accept defeat . At least five times a day , she pulls on the tip of her nose , believing that her efforts will somehow win her a straighter one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting room , translating and interpreting the text as verses of fortitude and godly reliance , closing her case with the reminder that he never got her a birthday gift . <br> When logic fails , Anju 's argument devolves . She whimpers , tugging at the hem of her T-shirt ( " Eddi , stop stretching it ! " Ammachi warns ) , and threatens to run away , which is a predictable threat , as she is always running away and Linno is always sent to fetch her . The only mystery lies in which neighbor 's house Anju might choose as her sanctuary . Usually Linno finds her sitting on someone 's front step , bleakly toeing patterns in the dirt until she spots Linno in the yard . Anju always comes away quietly , gradually softening beneath the weight of her sister 's hand on her shoulder . Sometimes , after a silence , Anju will ask , " What took you so long ? " <br> Melvin retires to the daybed with his arm over his eyes while Ammachi lectures , while Linno draws , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until at last he says , " Enough . " Melvin sits up and rubs his eyes with his fists , muttering that it is bet- ter to disappoint God than to disappoint daughters . " At least God forgives . " <br> Linno accompanies her father to the Fancy Shoppe , riding sidesaddle on the back of his bicycle , her heels held away from the spokes . They cut through mingled smells of dung , earth , freshwater , pesticides . They bump along between paddy fields that , in stillness , reflect the sky 's blue with such clarity that grass seems to spring from liquid sky . At the water 's edge , a medley of palms bend low , falling in love with their likenesses , while webs of light spangle the dark undersides of the leaves . Whenever a bus appears on the horizon , Melvin pulls over to the side and waits for the bus to groan past , spewing dust and diesel in its wake , before he plunges his foot down onto the pedal . Her view of the road is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down to the unsettling clutch of his fingers around the handlebars . <br> Linno wonders what kind of gut feeling struck Melvin on the day her mother died . Perhaps he had seen her funeral face in dreams , with skin so spackled over with paint that she seemed a porcelain replica of the person she had been . Here was her lineless forehead , every wrinkle erased like a past swept clean . Here was her tiny smile , as though amused by a secret . <br> After the funeral , the albums were all packed away in trunks , but a single photo of Gracie remains within reach : the newlywed photograph , a black-and-white double portrait that every couple took in those days , tucked in a back pocket of Ammachi 's Bible . Gracie appears vaguely pretty but in a sharp , plain way , considerably shorter than Melvin , and cheerless . Husband and wife stand next to each other , shoulders touching , gazing sternly up into the camera as if being summoned into battle . <br> . . . <br> The Entertainment comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Linno and Anju spend the evening dutifully guarding the bag from interference , though no one wants to interfere more than they do They shove wads of chapati into their mouths , fixated on the bag . They argue over who should hold it and how . Anju tries to educate Linno about a rarely read passage in the Bible , which suggests that younger sisters should always get their way . Anju is a strange little sieve of general knowledge , continually dribbling answers to questions that no one has asked . This one Linno knows not to believe , just as she did n't believe it that last time with her Cadbury Fruit &amp; Nut . <br> After dinner , the girls have no choice but to wait on the front step , swatting at mosquitoes , the Entertainment placed equidistant between them . Theirs is a small brick and stucco house with a thatched ola roof , humbly crouched among the slanting coconut trees that are charming by day yet spindly , looming and long-armed by night . Two lanky tree trunks span the brook in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , testing their balance and bravery , light as birds on a branch . <br> As the night softens with fog , the family collects on the front steps . Dragging a plastic chair behind her , Ammachi mutters that this is a show she has seen before , and what it has to do with Yesu 's birth , she does not know . For the first time in history , Melvin allows Linno to assist him , while Anju is told to sit on the steps . In mute protest , Anju takes a pose beyond her nine years , legs crossed , head tilted , fingers laced around her knee , like a woman in a magazine . <br> From the paper bag , Melvin lifts a parcel whose label displays two words in red block letters : rainbow thunder . Out of the parcel , plastic crackling , Melvin pulls a bundle of sparklers . <br> These Linno lights as reverently as if she were lighting candles at church . All else around her dissolves into shadow and there is only the single captive star , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Even Ammachi accepts a sparkler and , equally transfixed , begins circling hers in figure eights , watching the wild spray of orange light , frowning a little when it dies to a glowing ember . <br> And then , what fire ! One aerial miracle follows the next . There is the Volcano  --  a small cone that splutters before erupting into a great geiser of liquid flame , rising , rising , borne on a splendid gushing noise . The Mouse , which Melvin lights from the throat of an empty toddy bottle , a faint sizzle before the white-pink bullet shoots into the trees and spirals over the branches . And finally , the Necklace , a length of tiny dynamite that Melvin ties to a low branch of the jackfruit tree . When he lights the fuse , everyone plugs their ears against the sound , a violent rifle crack , mercilessly loud as it pop-pop-pops all the way up to the branch . <br> A silky smoke roams over the ground as Ammachi murmurs , grudgingly , that firecrackers are not so bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice set of mugs over these light tricks any day . " In a rare embrace of Western custom , she cites the examples of other countries where the father gives Christmas gifts to the entire family . Even his mother . <br> Melvin points out that his sister , Jilu , is American . " When was the last time she gave us anything ? " <br> " Hah , Jilu was American ! Now she is in Canada . And what do you mean anything ? " Ammachi rattles off a list of items : " Soap , socks , a fitted sheet , Tang . . . " <br> " Those socks were used . And that fitted sheet only fit half a bed . " <br> While Ammachi and Melvin argue over Jilu 's largesse , Linno begins untying what is left of the Necklace from its branch . Several links remain on the blown fuse . <br> Anju calls out , " Eh , Linno , we already lit that one . " <br> Linno is studying the remnants of the Necklace when she looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pinned , suddenly , by the look of fear in a grown man 's face . <br> " Drop that  --  " Melvin says , or begins to say , she can not tell . <br> Because from this point , everything happens with a slow grace , in the space of seconds . Linno feels nothing and sees everything , in all its strange clarity . The links exploding in her palm , fire flowering and blazing above the watch that she wears facing in so she can check the time discreetly when she is at school . The face of the watch , splashed with light , now a flickering gold coin and above it , her hand held captive by a star , the shifting folds of flame and heat giving way to that time when her mother slit her finger while scaling a fish , how astonishing it was , the scarlet simplicity of what dripped from her , wet petals on the edge of the sink . <br> And then Linno realizes that what she thought was the screaming of wind is a sound that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Continues ...
