<p> It 's raining in the tunnel . After a downpour , water drains through the old hospital , trickling toward the foundation . <p> As it seeps into this whitewashed brick passage , it drips on three young people whose splashing footfalls echo in the gloom . <p> Down here in the basement , it 's unlikely that the security guards they avoided outside will find them . But they keep quiet , alert for noise or light . <p> In rooms opening off the tunnel they see outdated medical instruments , old files , a rack of moldering fur coats and luggage that once belonged to patients . <p> They push past the wood lattice blocking an alcove . Mice scatter as flashlight beams bob over stacks of white boxes containing bandages , slings and vials of medicine . Around the room are shovels , sand bags and 35-gallon drums of water - civil defense rations . <p> This place is a forgotten fallout shelter , a legacy of mid-20th century preparedness . Finding it here in the basement of this abandoned mental asylum in Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , members of a group called Dark Passage . <p> They are part of a subculture in cities around the world that visits off-limits places . From subway tunnels and bridges to shuttered factories and abandoned buildings , they chronicle their excursions in magazines , photographs , on Web sites and even in formal meetings modeled on those of Victorian exploration societies . <p> They call themselves " urban explorers . " <p> Police call them trespassers . <p> The law often stands between urban explorers and the destinations they approach like irreverent tourists . And their hobby leads them to places loaded with rotting staircases , rodents and toxic materials . <p> What draws them ? <p> " The appeal to me is to go to places that tell a story , " says Julia Solis , who began Dark Passage almost three years ago . " It 's like an archaeological expedition . It gives you insight into a whole other time period . " <p> She was one of those creeping through the asylum 's terra incognita . The expedition was documented in a video made grainy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirping of crickets . <p> Clandestine expeditions are as old as mischief itself , since kids were first emboldened to check out that creepy , boarded-up house down the block . <p> But as an avocation with a name , urban exploration can be traced to 1977 and the formation of the San Francisco Suicide Club . <p> Among the club 's exploits : an annual black-tie , potluck dinner on the walkway of the Golden Gate Bridge , and tours of the Oakland subway in formal dress . <p> " I would n't say that exploring the urban environment was invented in San Francisco , " says John Law , also known as Sebastian Melmoth , an early member of the club . " But to use it as a playground , the Suicide Club was the first group to pursue that in the extreme . " <p> Others have followed . <p> Members of the Jinx Project are drawn to New York 's lows and highs , its subway tunnels and bridges . <p> In Detroit , Daniel Kosmowski , embarked on a crusade to save the historic Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw how " strip miners " were gutting and selling it piece by piece to scrap yards and antique dealers . <p> A writer , Julia Solis feeds her fiction with the odd artifacts and remnants of human history discovered in abandoned asylums . Photographs she 's taken capture the eerie aura of their crumbling interiors . <p> Whatever their specialty , urban explorers crave what Melmoth calls the " negative spaces " of urban environments . " I ca n't even look at a sewer grate without wondering what 's underneath , " he says . <p> Urban explorers claim to have little in common with the graffiti artists , vandals and squatters who also frequent their destinations . <p> " It 's very important to me that the places are left exactly as they are , " Solis says . " Do n't change them , do n't take from them , do n't put graffiti on the wall even though the place is slated for demolition . " <p> To learn the history of the hospitals she visits and to improve the odds of returning , Solis has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards , seeing the sprawling structures as museums in the rough , have even given her permission to poke around , she says . <p> But to police , trespassing is an offense , not a recreational activity . There 's a good reason subway tunnels with high-voltage rails and condemned factories laced with PCBs are off limits . And police do make arrests . <p> The latest issue of Infiltration , " the zine about going places you 're not supposed to go , " is dedicated to accounts of getting caught in the act . <p> One explorer tells of getting collared for climbing a 25-story construction crane . Another recounts a bust by police of a party in an enormous Uniroyal tire beside a Detroit highway . Most of those caught were fined ; one excursion culminated in a night in jail . <p> " We 've found them in all the subway tunnels , " says Mike Walker , a security spokesman for the Toronto Transit Commission . " Anywhere there 's an opportunity to infiltrate the system , they 'll take that as a challenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to get in . Ever , " claims an associate of Solis who gives only his nickname , Tindalos . " More often than not , someone 's been there before us . " <p> Using tactics that helped them fight graffiti artists , transit cops in Toronto - the city where Infiltration is published - monitor the same communication tool explorers use most . <p> " Almost all our information comes from intelligence gathering , especially Web surfing , " Walker says . " We know all the players , all the instigators . " <p> By picking up tips on the Web , Walker says , transit police have been successful in foiling expeditions before they start . <p> Investigators have even made housecalls . A note left in a Toronto subway tunnel recently led them to a Web site , an e-mail address , and eventually to the doorstep of an explorer going by the name Devastator . <p> " Our goal is to educate rather than enforce , " says Walker , who would not elaborate on the encounter , but made it clear that Devastator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If we come across somebody bragging , " he says , " we 'll track them down . " <p> If representation on the Web is an accurate measure , urban exploration is thriving as a global subculture . <p> A Web ring dedicated to touring " off-limits locations " links 78 sites , with countries as far-flung as Australia and the Netherlands represented . <p> " The Internet has played a big part in establishing contacts , " Vern Chastree , 21 , writes in an e-mail from Melbourne , Australia . Chastree , who goes by the name " id , " is a member of Cave Clan . <p> " It 's a very close community , " he writes . If they meet like-minded international visitors , " Cave Clan members are more than happy to show them around . The same courtesy is often extended to us . " <p> To foster such contacts , the Jinx Project publishes a magazine dedicated to urban exploration . <p> " We do n't cover adventure in the sense the word is used in the media , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughing Boy " Deyo . " We do n't have much interest in bungee jumping or the other Mountain Dew variety of extreme sports , " he says . <p> The explorers of an earlier era returned from mountaintops or jungles to describe their exploits before groups like the Royal Geographical Society , the science-minded set that supported Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay 's conquest of Mount Everest . <p> Today 's urban explorers imitate them , and not just in jest . Every month the Jinx Athenaeum Society 's meetings at Manhattan 's Gershwin Hotel provide a forum for active and armchair urban explorers . The gatherings feature lectures , performances and debates on such subjects as urban exploration 's portrayal in the media . <p> " We want to foster any impulse for adventure , " says Jinx member " Lefty " Leibowitz . " We want to open people up to the idea that an adventurous life can be led anywhere , even in the city .
