SCOTTSDALE , ARIZONA Joel Royer laid a hand on Hallie 's forearm and cleared his throat in an effort to get her attention , but she could n't look away from the body , the remnant , the wax figure that had once been her stepfather . Dear Lou , good cop , solid citizen , erstwhile knight in shining armor . He 'd been at the core of her life since she was six , and his passing had left her scrambling for balance . " It 's over , " Joel murmured , with undisguised relief . " Let 's get out of here . " His palm rested lightly on the small of her back , barely touching her and yet poised to administer one of those skillful , all but imperceptible shoves that always made her grind her back teeth a little . In that place , and in those circumstances , barely holding on the way she was , she wanted to whirl on him , spitting invectives . " I 'll meet you outside , " she said instead . Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , given the maelstrom of angry grief raging inside her , a psychological fire storm that showed no signs of dissipating anytime soon . Her resistance did not please Joel , but then , very little about her ever had . She was alternately too smart , then too stupid . Too ambitious , too lazy . Too strong , too weak . He hesitated , as if preparing one of his brilliant arguments , then sighed and walked away to join the other mourners milling in the entryway and on the sidewalk outside the funeral home . There would be a wake at the Late Shift Tavern , a celebration of Lou 's life and career , packed with cops , retired and active-duty , and their wives , but there was no graveside service on the schedule . Lou had left clear instructions that he was to be cremated , and he trusted Hallie to dispose of his ashes at her discretion " wherever , " as he 'd put it . She smiled ever so slightly to recall that Lou-esque stipulation , specific , but leaving room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his death , she had n't thought as far as potential ash-scattering locations yet . She reached out , touched his right hand . The chill was hard , penetrating , and her first instinct was to recoil , but she did n't give in . She looked back , making sure the room was empty , and then turned to Lou again , squeezing his icy fingers once , lightly . Tears stung her eyes , and she sniffled , as jerky eight-millimeter images flashed through her mind : Lou , trying to pass himself off as Santa Claus that first Christmas after he joined the family , when Hallie was in first grade , and waxing skeptical where such things as sleigh-driving saints , elves and flying reindeer were concerned ; Lou , proudly filming her dance-school recitals , drill team and cheerleading exploits and various graduation ceremonies , too : Cactus Ridge High , Scottsdale Community College , and culinary school . Lou , keeping a brave vigil at her mother 's bedside , while Cheryl died a lingering and unjust death from cancer . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known he was crumbling inside , broken by the most profound loss of his life . He 'd carried on , for Hallie 's sake and his own , and that , too , was vintage Lou . His creed had been a simple one : show up , stick it out , never sit on the bench if you can be in the game . " You were the best , " Hallie whispered to him now , hoping his spirit was somewhere nearby , close enough to hear , and at peace now . God knew , he had n't been himself the past few months ; he 'd been stressed out , and more than a little cranky . " You adored Mom . And you did n't just accept me , or tolerate me I was your kid . You really , truly loved me . Thank you for that , Lou . Thank you for coming along just when we needed you and for hanging in there for all the ups and downs . " From behind her , probably in the open doorway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to know Joel was back , hovering , hurrying her along , mentally prodding her as if they were still married , instead of three-years divorced . She suppressed her irritation again , already on emotional overload . She needed to choose her battles , more now than ever before , and she simply did n't have the resources for an all-out skirmish with Joel . She leaned down a little closer to Lou . " I know you 'd tell me to walk away from all this and never look back , if you could , " she told him softly , " and you 'd be right , too . Still , I do n't think it will come as any great surprise to you that I ca n't just let this go , because I 'll never have another coherent thought if I do . I 'll find out who shot you , and why , and I 'll see them pay , if it 's the last thing I ever do . " " Hallie ? " Joel 's voice was gruff . He was closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower lip and closed her eyes for a moment . When she opened them again , she thought she saw the barest suggestion of a smile touch one corner of Lou 's mouth . Her imagination , of course . " Good-bye , " she said gently . Then , spine straight , shoulders squared , she turned and walked back down the aisle , between the pews and the rows of folding chairs squeezed in to accommodate the sold-out crowd , toward the man she should never have married in the first place . " You 're going to the wake , right ? " Joel wanted to know . Tall , with sleek brown hair , stylishly cut , he looked more like an uptown lawyer than a struggling assistant D.A . The twins , Kiera and Kiley , now seven , had inherited his distinctive blue-gray eyes . Kiley had his persistence , too , and his tendency to make a federal case out of everything . It seemed to Hallie that her most sensitive nerves had migrated to the surface of her skin , jangling a discordant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely focus her eyes , but the people gathering at the Late Shift were Lou 's colleagues and friends , some of whom had known him since his days at the Academy . She owed it to them , and to Lou , to put in an appearance , although truly the last thing she felt like doing was hoisting a glass . Unless , of course , the glass contained white wine , to be consumed by candlelight while she soaked neck-deep in her old-fashioned bathtub at home . There had to be some kind of informal send-off , of course . Lou had made the most of his time on the planet , but his passing was premature to say the least . He 'd been fifty-eight years old , and in excellent health , with a lot of good living still ahead of him , and he 'd died cruelly , in the very place he should have been safest , taking five shots in the chest when he 'd surprised a burglar in his living room . That , at least , was the official position ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " Hallie answered , albeit belatedly . " I 'll stop by for a little while . " " The kids are okay ? " Joel was trying , she gave him credit for that . Although he paid support , and made all the appropriate father-noises , whenever she rattled his cage , anyway , she knew he was n't really interested in their children . On some level , he was a child himself , unwilling , or perhaps unable , to share the nest . " They 're with Mrs. Draper , across the courtyard , " Hallie answered , with a distracted nod . An odd numbness was beginning to roll in , like a fog , from the far edges of her consciousness . She should have welcomed any semblance of oblivion , she supposed , blessed and embraced any respite from the gnawing sorrow , and the wild , quiet fury ; instead , she struggled to stay grounded . If she was going to keep her promise to Lou , and to herself and she was , by God she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem a little shaky to me . " Go away , Joel , she wanted to say , leave me alone , but again she held her tongue . " I 'm fine , " she lied . The truth was , in the five days since Lou 's murder , she 'd barely slept or eaten . Her stomach lining burned twenty-four-seven , probably eating a hole in itself , and a low-grade migraine pulsed at the base of her skull . She 'd replayed old tapes from her answering machine over and over , fast-forwarding through countless mundane messages , seeking the unique timbre of Lou 's voice , trying to find some hint there , some clue that he 'd been in trouble . There had n't been any red flags , and yet . . . Oh , she was anything but fine . The police were looking for a burglar , a cheap hood with a drug habit and a quick trigger finger . Hallie , meanwhile , was haunted by an inexplicable certainty that the killing had been about something else entirely , something a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside , in the crisp October sunlight , fading now as the afternoon wore on toward another long night , Joel moved to touch Hallie 's back again . She skirted him , offered a hand to Lou 's captain , who was waiting on the sidewalk , next to the limo . " Thanks for being here , Lenny , " she said . Genuine tears brimmed in Lenny Bennedetto 's eyes . His wife , Rose , held his arm and leaned against him , offering silent comfort . " Lou was a decent guy , " he said . For Lenny , notorious for understatement , this was unbridled praise . " It 's a shame this had to happen . " Hallie nodded . Kissed Lenny 's cheek , then Rose 's . " You 're coming by the wake , of course ? " Rose asked . Lou had liked her , said she looked out for other cops ' wives . " For a little while , " Hallie agreed , suppressing a sigh . For Lou , she would do it , drink a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his many friends , slip out as soon as she could . " I 'll make sure she gets there okay , " Joel offered . Once again , Hallie was annoyed . Once again , she stifled the feeling , kept her mouth shut . Let this day be over , was her mantra . I just want to go home . Joel settled her in the back of the limo , then slipped in beside her , sitting a fraction of an inch too close on the sleek leather seat . Hallie moved over a little . " How 's Barbara ? " she asked . She liked Joel 's latest fiance he 'd had several since their divorce though she did n't know her well . She applied acrylics at Sue 's Nailhouse , took an endearing pride in her work , and , best of all , she was nice to Kiera and Kiley . Joel took her hand , and she did n't have the strength to pull away . " Never mind her , " he said . " I 've been thinking , Hallie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean . After all , we have the kids " Hallie stared at her ex-husband , amazed . They 'd done nothing but fight while they were married , and the divorce had n't done a great deal to change that . She 'd worked hard to build her reputation as a chef , then open her small restaurant , Princess and the Pea , and build it into a thriving concern . She 'd pursued her goals single-mindedly , made a life for herself and the twins , put aside cash , paid off piles of old bills . She was n't about to revisit her misguided past . " You ca n't be serious , " she said . " I know I made some mistakes , " he allowed . Generous of him . She reached the end of her rope with a painful yank , nearly strangled on the impact . " Right , " she said . " You started sleeping with your secretary before our honeymoon was over . Then there was that girl who sold shoes at Nordstrom , followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefcase " " Hallie . " He was scolding her . God , the nerve , the unmitigated gall of the man to even think there was a chance they could start over , let alone make the suggestion right to her face . It came to her that he was still holding her hands and she wrenched free , as exasperated with herself as she was with him . " Do n't , Joel , " she said . " Do n't say another word . Our marriage is over heck , it was probably over before it started . Let 's just leave it at that , because if this conversation does n't stop right here , right now , I 'll say something I 'll regret , and I do n't want to do that . " " Of course you do n't . " He smiled fondly , certain of his irresistibility . " Because of Lou , " she clarified . He gazed soulfully into her eyes for a long moment , injured . " Because of Lou , " he echoed . Hallie simply shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purring at the curb in front of the Late Shift , where Lou had played darts and billiards and swapped stories with old pals . After her mother 's death , the place had been a second home for him , a congenial refuge where there was always light , music and good beer . The bar was packed , and people seemed to surge toward her from every direction , kissing her cheek , patting her hand , telling her what a great guy Lou had been . Swamping her with emotions that nearly took her breath away . She smiled resolutely , listening and nodding at intervals , trying hard not to cry . For the better part of two hours , she kept up the front , avoiding Joel to the best of her ability , listening to tall tales about Lou 's exploits as a vice cop , tucking them away in her heart like matchbook covers and postcards in a scrapbook . There was only one customer in the Late Shift whom she did n't recognize , an older man , with a long face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome once , maybe even athletic , given his tall , rangy frame , but time had extracted its full measure , moment by moment , year by year . She might have thought he was there by accident , and not a mourner at all , the way he sat keeping his own counsel and nursing a cup of coffee at the far end of the bar , talking to no one , except that every time her glance strayed in his direction , she caught him looking right back at her . He was n't even trying to be subtle about it . Prompted by a certain distracted curiosity , she made her way toward him , perched on the edge of the empty stool next to his . He managed a lugubrious smile as he took in her trim dark suit and pearls , raised his coffee cup slightly off the saucer , as if to toast her . " Hello , Hallie , " he said . She studied him , tilting her head to one side . Maybe he was a member of Lou 's bowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her stepfather 's boisterous backyard barbeques . " Have we met ? " " Once or twice , " he said . " It 's not important . " He put out a hand . " Name 's Charlie Long , " he explained . " Lou and I were buddies , and business associates , after a fashion . " Hallie felt a strange quickening , deep in her middle , in that place where gut instincts hang out , as she shook his hand . " I did n't see you at the service , " she said . " I try to avoid funerals . " Charlie took a pack of cigarettes from the inside pocket of his tobacco-scented suit jacket , shook one out , offered it halfheartedly to Hallie . As he 'd probably expected , she refused , and he lit up , drew deeply on the smoke , exhaled across the wide surface of the bar . " Well , thank you for coming to the wake , " Hallie said . The brief silence that had fallen between them , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lou would have appreciated that . " Charlie gave a raspy chuckle that Hallie might have read as contempt if she had n't caught a glimpse of sad amusement in his hound-dog eyes . " Lou and me , we said all that needed to be said , before the fact . I 'm here for two reasons , Mrs. Royer one , I wanted to talk to you , and two , I believe in hiding in plain sight . " She did n't correct him , though she had n't used her married name since the divorce . In her mind , she was Hallie Waitlin , Lou and Cheryl 's daughter . A little shiver moved up her spine . Here it came , the news she 'd expected , suspected , and dreaded , all at once , from the moment she 'd learned of Lou 's death . She braced herself , waited . " These guys , " Charlie said , cocking a thumb over one slumped shoulder , apparently to indicate not just Lou 's friends , but the police department itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-time thug , just somebody who did n't expect to get caught tossing a house , and panicked when he did . " He paused , studied her face , made a visible decision to trust her . " It 's bullshit , pure and simple . " He took a very small manila packet from the same pocket where he 'd stashed his cigarettes earlier , laid it on the bar , nodded his approval when she automatically palmed the item and slid it into her purse . " Lou Waitlin could have handled any fruitcake cat burglar . This was a professional hit . Company business . " Hallie 's mouth fell open , and her stomach dropped , spinning . She wanted to protest that Charlie 's theory was crazy , something out of a movie or a bad detective novel , but she knew it was n't . The idea resonated only too well with her own admittedly nebulous suspicions . Charlie looked around casually , spotted Joel making his way through the crowd , just as Hallie did . " I 'd better get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to take out the packet he 'd given her then and there , see what it contained , but she did n't move . She watched as Charlie Long laid a five-dollar bill on the bar and shouldered his way through the crowd of cops toward the door . Joel reached her side . " Who was that ? " " No idea , " Hallie said , frowning . " Are you ready to go home ? " " Yes , " she replied , secure in the truth of that single word , if nothing else . He peered through the front window at the street , squinting a little . " The limo is gone . " " I 'll get a cab , " she said , and hurried away before he could offer to join her . All she could think about , in that moment , was the packet Charlie had given her ; whatever was inside would change her life , probably irrevocably . A sensible person would toss the thing into the nearest trash bin and forget about it . Hallie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned . Outside , the night breeze was picking up and there was no sign of Charlie . Maybe , Hallie thought , with grim fancy , she 'd imagined him , along with their brief but patently disturbing conversation . By some miracle , a cab was passing ; she raised one hand , well aware that Joel was probably headed in her direction at that very moment , and the car rattled to a stop at the curb . She jumped in , spouted her address , and felt a dizzying sense of relief as she looked back through the rear window . Joel was on the sidewalk , hands stuffed into the pockets of his stylish overcoat , watching the car pull away . Within twenty minutes , she was home . She tipped the driver generously and dashed up the walk to her own door , fumbling a little with the key . Inside , she flipped on the hall lights , paused beside the telephone table in the hallway the light on the answering machine was blinking debated her options for a moment , wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pressed the play button . Mrs. Draper might have called with some concern about Kiley and Kiera . The voice she heard was totally unfamiliar , the tone quietly callous , and somehow insinuating . " I saw you at the bar , Hallie , " the man said . " What was in the package ? " Hallie laid a hand to her heart , her breathing rapid and shallow , her eyes wide with alarm . The message ended with the click of a receiver being replaced , and she knew , even before she checked the caller ID screen , that the effort was wasted . Unknown name , unknown number , it read . She turned around , locked and bolted the door behind her , then walked through the dining room to the spacious kitchen . Through the window over the sink , she could see the courtyard , still riotous with summer roses , and the lights of Nora Draper 's townhouse . She fumbled for the phone hanging near the stove , speed-dialed the number . Her neighbor answered immediately , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckle with relief . She freed her shoulder-length hair from its clip at the back of her head and ran the fingers of her right hand through it . She would shed pearls , suit and pantyhose as soon as it was feasible . " It 's me , Hallie , " she said . " I 'm back . Are Kiera and Kiley okay ? " " Why , bless your heart , " Nora replied , " they 're just fine . We 're having a slumber party . " Hallie swallowed in an effort to rein in her emotions a little . " You 're sure you do n't mind keeping the girls overnight ? " " Mind ? I 'm enjoying every moment . " There was a gentle pause . " Are you all right , dear ? Do you need anything ? I just hate to think of you over there all alone , trying to cope with a loss like this . You could sleep here , you know . I 'd fold out the hide-a-bed . " Hallie smiled , blinking back tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said quietly . She would examine the contents of the little manila envelope now , have that private glass of wine she 'd been promising herself , that long , hot bath , and then slip between the sheets , close her eyes and , please God , step outside her life , however temporarily , into sweet oblivion . Time enough to think about the phone message when the daylight returned . " I 'll come and get the girls in the morning . " " You 're exhausted , " Nora said kindly . " Get a good night 's sleep . " " I will , " Hallie promised , missing her long-dead mother sorely , missing Lou . She had her daughters and a few friends acquaintances , really , since her long work days had n't left much time for socializing and she was used to being independent , but she 'd never felt more profoundly alone , or more vulnerable . She hung up , checked the front and back locks again , then sat down at the dining room table , opened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers trembled slightly as she lifted the flap and turned the package upside down . There was a little brass key inside , with a paper tag attached , on which Lou had written , Virgin Mary . Hallie smiled and shook her head , immediately breaking the code . She held the key against her heart for a long moment , then carried it into her bedroom and set it carefully on her nightstand . She proceeded to the adjoining bathroom , where she lit candles and started water running in the tub , then backtracked to the kitchen for a glass of Chardonnay . After a long , restorative soak , she put on a cotton nightshirt and crawled into bed , where , to her great surprise , she slept soundly until the twins awakened her the next morning , leaping on the mattress and bouncing with their usual exuberance . Hallie groaned , then laughed , then got out of bed . At the start of that day , so innocent and so ordinary , she could not have imagined how it would end . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she was dressed , and the three of them had had cereal and fruit at the breakfast bar . Two sets of blue-gray eyes regarded her solemnly . " Grampa 's dead , " Kiley said , as though that dispensed with any need to set foot in the man 's house . " Do n't say that , " Kiera protested . " It 's true . " " Enough , " Hallie said , and poured herself a second cup of coffee . She was stalling . Lou 's place , without Lou . It would be like a body without a heart . The girls missed him terribly ; he 'd been a surrogate father to them , since Joel was n't interested . " If you 'd rather stay with Mrs. Draper , I 'm sure it can be arranged . " " I want to go with you , " Kiera said . " Me , too , " Kiley decided . Hallie went into her room , collected the key , slipped it into the hip pocket of her jeans . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locked up the condo , and loaded the kids into the backseat of her navy blue BMW . When the seatbelts were fastened and the engine was humming , they started across town . Lou 's split-level rancher was in a modest section of Phoenix , on a tree-lined street . While many houses in the Valley of the Sun boasted stucco walls and tile roofs , with courtyards and rock gardens instead of lawns , Lou 's was a simple brick affair with green shutters . There were flower beds and green grass in the front yard , though it was starting to look a little overgrown . Hallie hesitated for a few moments , just sitting there in the driveway with the BMW still running , then switched off the ignition , pocketed the keys , and got out . Virgin Mary , she thought , remembering the scrawled letters on the key tag , and headed for the storage shed in the backyard . The door was padlocked , but Hallie knew the combination , and she opened it easily . Kiera and Kiley , having no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawnmower , an assortment of tools , and boxes of Christmas paraphernalia , among other things , raced toward the tire swing Lou had put up years before , for Hallie , and left their mother to her mysterious pursuits . It took half an hour of dusty exploration , but Hallie finally located the nearly life-size plastic Nativity set that had graced the front yard every holiday season , from the Friday after Thanksgiving until the second of January . Each piece was swaddled in newspaper , and she unwrapped Joseph , a shepherd , and one of the Wise Men before coming at last to Mary . Upending the statue on the cement floor , she found a metal cashbox wedged into the base . Stomach fluttering , she pulled it out , rewrapped Mary , and put her back with the other decorations . Then , after running her hands down the thighs of her jeans , she brought out the tagged key and turned the lock . At first , the contents seemed innocuous documents , printouts downloaded from the Internet , newspaper clippings , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallie closed the box , held it protectively in both hands as she stepped outside into the fresh air and sunlight . Kiera and Kiley were playing on the tire swing , getting along for once , laughing . Hallie looked around , the hairs rising on the back of her neck , then made her way to the relative privacy of the covered patio , where Lou had probably grilled a million hot dogs and hamburgers over the years . She sat down at the picnic table , feeling weak in the knees , the box before her , and raised the lid again . The computer printouts were maps to places in the desert , campgrounds mostly , and parks . Some were marked , in Lou 's handwriting , with small , indented X 's . The snapshots showed men in various bars , and other dark places , exchanging things , or just talking in earnest . Hallie recognized several of the men , and her flesh prickled . She unfolded a document , smoothed it on the surface of the picnic table , and scanned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone conversation , and the subject was some kind of shipment , being brought in from Mexico . Hallie felt another sick quiver in the pit of her stomach . This was stuff she did n't want to know , and the names , many of them all-too-familiar , were ones she did n't want to recognize . She looked over her shoulder , and was startled to see Joel standing by the swing , hands in the pockets of his chinos , chatting with the girls . Their faces were upturned , adoring . Hallie felt a sudden urge to race across the lawn , gather her children close , hustle them away . Instead , she froze , there where Lou had served so many summer meals , watching as her ex-husband looked up , met her gaze , and ambled toward her . His hands were still in his pockets . He was just a few feet away when she found her voice . " What are you doing here ? " she asked . Stupid question . His face was in some of the pictures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought , if you knew this stuff , why did n't you warn me ? She knew the answer , of course . Lou had been pursuing a major investigation , and he had n't expected to die before it was completed . He would n't have compromised the case by discussing it with a civilian , even if that civilian was his stepdaughter , with children sired by one of the suspects . " Just thought I 'd see how you 're doing this morning , " Joel said . He was trying not to look at the open cashbox and the papers , but he did n't succeed . " What have we here ? " Hallie was surprised at how easily the lie sprang to her lips . She even managed a cordial smile . " Stocks , bonds , some appraisal photographs , " she said . " It seems Lou left me something besides this house and his pension fund . " " Let 's have a look , " Joel suggested , as if he had every right . Hallie shuffled everything back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " It 's all pretty straightforward , " she said . " I can handle it . " He frowned , and she got to her feet , cradling the box . Smiling . " Why do n't you and Barbara stop by the restaurant Saturday night ? " she said , talking too fast , too eagerly . " I 've got a new dish you might like to try . On the house , of course . " Joel arched an eyebrow , still watching the box . " Okay , " he said , uncertainly . Then he rustled up a smile of his own . " I could take the kids for the day . Give you a little break . " A chill danced up Hallie 's spine . " We have plans , " she replied lightly . " Stop by the restaurant Saturday night , Joel . " He got to his feet . " Girls ! " Hallie called . " Come on . Time to go . " " Let me have the box , Hallie , " Joel insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallie chimed . She 'd never make it to the BMW , still parked in the driveway in front of the house , but Lou 's old pickup was behind the shed , facing the alley fence , and the keys were probably in the ignition . Nobody in their right mind , Lou had always maintained , would steal that worthless truck , but he could always hope . She started toward the girls , and the pickup truck , her strides long , her heart pounding in her throat . She shuffled her surprised daughters into the front seat of the old rig , tossed the box in after them , and scrambled behind the wheel . Joel was several yards behind her , but he was taller , and intent on the chase . Hallie had passed easily under the clotheslines , but Joel had gotten himself entangled , affording her precious moments to start the sputtering motor and push down the locks on the doors . " Mommy , " Kiera piped up . " What are you ? " Hallie stepped on the clutch , shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , knocking it down , jostling into the alley . " Daddy is chasing us ! " Kiley announced , looking back through the oval window . " Mommy , stop ! " Hallie shifted again , and barreled toward the end of the alley , picking up speed with every jostle and bump . A glance at the rearview mirror showed Joel standing in the alley , glaring after her and swearing . It would n't be long until he regained his senses and came after them , but Hallie had grown up in that neighborhood , and she knew every side street , every shortcut , and every dead end . By the time he got back to his car , she and the girls and the evidence Lou had gathered would be long gone . Kiley tried again . " Mommy ? " Hallie took the corner on two wheels , tires screeching . " Fasten your seat belts , girls , " she said . " We 're going on a little trip . " The first thing she did , once they had left Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
