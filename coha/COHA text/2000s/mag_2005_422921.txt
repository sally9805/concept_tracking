Photograph Susan Taylor and Cornel West at The Essence Music Festival Empowerment Seminars , held over the July Fourth weekend at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center just weeks before the devastation that would engulf the city . // Cornel West-scholar , activist , writer , preacher , teacher-sat down with me in New Orleans this summer at The Essence Music Festival , which we have held in the city 's Superdome and Convention Center over the July Fourth weekend for 11 years . Dr. West and I spoke about sisters ' and brothers ' pressing need to love one another more fully . We had our conversation in a place where Black love would be all that would hold us together after the city and the Gulf were deluged and left with mass devastation , death and despair . The horror the world watched unfold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Brother West wrote in The Observer , " the most naked manifestation of conservative social policy towards the poor , where the message for decades has been : " You 're on your own . " " Poor Black people 's humanity , he added , has been rendered invisible , so they were not a high priority once the affluent had gotten out and the helicopters came for the few ; most of the people stuck on rooftops and in shelters and left to die on the side of the road were poor and Black . " From slave ships to the Superdome was not that big a journey , " he observed . The Black middle class now has an even greater obligation , Professor West said , to actively love the 33 percent of Black children living in poverty and to fight for them . And " now that the aid is pouring in , vital as it is , " he cautioned , " do not confuse charity with justice . I 'm not asking for a revolution . I am asking for reform . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here , our conversation at the Convention Center about how we sisters and brothers can love one another more strongly and stand together on solid ground : Brother Cornel , throughout our history here , Black love has been under siege : We do n't fully understand how 250 years of slavery along with continuing racism and oppression have deeply fractured our lives and relationships . Our young suffer in underserved schools and are corralled into prisons ; disparities in health care , housing and employment cripple us . But strong partnerships will strengthen us so no forces arrayed against us can win . How can we create healthier , lasting relationships ? You do n't learn how to love without being courageous and free . The challenge for us brothers has been mustering the courage to really look at ourselves , examine ourselves and find out who we really are . In a certain sense this means learning how to die and allowing a new self to emerge . This is important in all relationships and necessary if we are to love in a substantive way . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have n't loved deeply enough . This is a difficult task given that Black culture and this society do n't encourage emotional honesty , intimacy or self-love in men . So how do we begin to shift ? How can brothers like you encourage more men to be who they truly are and be true to their emotional selves ? We have to form fellowships and networks of brothers who are trying to exemplify the courage to love . But courage is relatively sparse ; people who want to be free are always a small group . Most would rather languish in conformity , complacency and even cowardice . But what is life for but to learn to love and be free and courageous ? Are you brothers having these very critical discussions among yourselves ? Absolutely ! And the conversations are rich , because we have to be vulnerable . We have to be willing to be emotionally naked and to risk showing aspects of ourselves that we 're not always proud of . But the fellowship helps us overcome the fear we have of facing ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . We brothers here in America wrestle with a profound rage . We have to be on the defensive all the time and ready for the next insult or assault . So it feels much more natural to pose and posture . When you 're on the defensive all the time , it 's very difficult to risk opening yourself and being vulnerable . But at the same time you say to yourself , I ca n't go through life in this posing posture without really loving or knowing what it 's like to be free , because I 'll never know me . What is it we women need to know about the interior lives of our men that is difficult for them to articulate ? I think a number of sisters already know , because you have studied the brothers , loved the brothers , reflected on the brothers-sometimes more than the brothers have reflected on themselves . But the major thing to know is how a mature response to the profound rage can be enacted and that it takes the form of a certain kind of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correction . Because it 's so easy for us brothers to manipulate sisters ' patience , as the sisters attune to our rage . If a woman is either too patient or even too submissive and deferential , she easily becomes an object of manipulation . So we want sisters to acknowledge the rage , but we also need love , patience and correction . It 's the only way we will grow . Some brothers are denying the rage , the way America wants to deny the source of the rage , which is racism . Many Black women are tired , disappointed and hurt . Some have run out of patience and have given up . Sisters want respect and fidelity , help with finances , chores and caring for the children . What can Black women do to build the supportive and self-respecting partnerships they deserve without sacrificing themselves ? The patience I 'm talking about goes hand in hand with the willingness to be tender , to be sweet and kind without being manipulated by brothers . You want to do it in such a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own integrity . Because both of us-men and women-are wounded . And I think in life the fundamental question is whether you choose to be a wounded hurter or a wounded healer . And choosing to be a wounded healer is always difficult , but it is spiritually mature , morally correct , and in the end the most rewarding . Women feel most deeply wounded when we are betrayed by infidelity . Infidelity has dissolved as many relationships as economic pressures have , and this situation is having a disastrous impact on Black families . Is it just all about sex ? Do some men just want multiple partners , or is infidelity driven by a hunger and a longing for something deeper that men and women need to understand ? I think it 's both . On the one hand there 's just a certain kind of greed , a sense of wanting everything , having one 's cake and eating it too . The whole culture sends the message-through the mass media and advertising-that you can have it all . But what they 're talking about is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not talking about what you experience when you look into the eyes of your child , your mother , your loved one , your valued one . The one who will be there when you 're in a wheelchair , or in the hospital with you when you 're down and out . That 's the joy that is pushed to the background . We 're bombarded with the need to have pleasure , which encourages greed and a self that 's without constraint . But on a deeper level , compulsive sexual behavior does bespeak a certain void that many of us brothers have . And we have a fear of dealing with the void , because it will require much more than just going to the next club or getting the next phone number . You 're going to have to truly deal with people you love , and change your life . You really have to have someone who you can be honest , candid and open with or you 'll end up drifting . Our relationships have to be substantive . If you just settle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start questioning why you 're with this person . My husband , Khephra , says so often that our great need is for brothers to grow up , mature and take responsibility for their relationships . Securing our children and recovering our communities demand that we all make major changes in our lives and in our relationships . Photograph Princeton professor Cornel West , author of the seminal Race Matters , shares his hip-hop smarts in his recent CD , Street Knowledge . // Historically , for Black people , religion has played an important role in getting us to think about changing our lives . Jesus changed many a Negro 's life ; I can testify to that myself . This is not to say that the church is n't flawed as an institution , and leadership needs to meet a lot of challenges . But there is no doubt that religion has made a lot of Black people examine themselves , put restraints on themselves , and become more responsible and accountable to something outside their egos . The breaking down of narcissism-that 's very much what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void that is still there , that narcissism does n't even fill . It 's after your 105th affair and you 're still lonely-it 's time to check yourself . Something is wrong . Video images and messages in the music that degrade Black women are having a tremendously negative impact on our community-glorifying pimp life , portraying our young women as disposable sexual objects , and encouraging young men to be players forever , instead of even trying to mature . We seem so far away from our needed cultural shift . We have to be real enough to tell the truth , to talk about the consequences of being a player , that in the face of death , dread and disappointment , the playing wo n't fill the void that you have to come to terms with and that it 's actually going to reinforce it . If your mother dies , the strip club wo n't provide the resources to deal with that loss . But we do see folks in hip-hop culture undergoing changes . For all we know , 50 Cent may end up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of experiences . You 've been married three times , and now you 're single . What have you learned from those unions ? I 've learned that I need to confront my own fears and anxieties more candidly so that I really know who I am . So what I bring to the table is not looking for someone to fill my void , so that I 'm not looking outward to find fulfillment , but already have a certain sense of it I can share with another . This takes a tremendous level of spiritual development . I have to attend to keeping doubt and fear from getting in the way of my happiness and development . What gets in your way , and how do you get past what could hinder you ? The kind of calling that I have requires so much running , so much traveling and so much intense interaction with larger publics . This goes hand in hand with a certain loneliness in the depths of the soul . You have to take time to cultivate relationships . And when you 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult to do that . And so I have to ask myself if I have a fear of wanting to take more time to cultivate a relationship or to reprioritize some of my life . Or is it easier for me to just stay on this intense schedule , and then think that somehow I 'm going to succeed in a relationship ? And how do you answer that question ? Well , I think I know it in my head , but the question is , can I enact it in my own heart and soul and in my practice ? Because as I get older , my schedule tends to intensify . I have two children , so I 've already had my chances in a certain sense . My son , Cliff , is 28 and my little daughter , Zeta , is 5 . Talking about joy-that 's as deep as it gets . I 've got to make them the priority , no matter what , and give them some idea of what it 's like to be deeply loved , so they are cultivating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey . What kind of relationship would you like to see your son , Cliff , have ? Well , I do n't want him to emulate me . I want him to find himself and be himself . But most of all I want him to be mature , to have a highly cultivated capacity to love , to be patient , to open himself and be vulnerable . And the same is true when my little daughter matures . She 's got to be willing and able to deal with the patriarchal ego and wounded pride of our men ; and she still has to keep track of male humanity in such a way that she 's open to it , even as she deals with some of the scars that sadly will come just from being a woman in a patriarchal world . Black children will continue to catch hell as long as we do n't partner better or love each other better . And until building healthy relationships becomes a priority , we wo n't be able to handle the challenges undermining our progress . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for freedom and courage enacted . Black people have taught the world how to lament in the spiritual . We have taught the world how to deal with darkness and still smile . With our funk we taught the world how to boogie down and shake-even under Jim Crow . But we also need to learn to love each other . It 's the most revolutionary thing we can do . Yes , how we relate to one another is a deeply spiritual issue . And it is the key to our transformation . Sidebar ON INFIDELITY : " There 's just a certain kind of greed .
