Soaring high above Noreela , it was easy to believe that the world had ended again . The evidence of scared , scattered communities lay spread out below , all of them illuminated against a darkness that should not be . Ten thousand faces would be searching for the sun but seeing only this unnatural dusk , and Lenora wondered what they would think were they to spy the hawk . Would they know ? Would they have any inkling of what they were looking at ? She thought not . But soon that would change . For most of the night , Lenora had been trying to avoid the Mages ' attention . She sat motionless and silent , as far back on the hawk 's tail as she could go , two short swords buried in the creature 's hide to provide precious handholds . She watched her masters with a sense of fear the likes of which she had never felt before . The Mages had changed so much . They were strangers to her now . For the past three hundred years , Angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthy musings on revenge . Lenora had served them and listened-their trusted lieutenant-and over time they had become shadows of themselves : mad old things who showed only occasional flashes of their former brilliance and brutality . Ensconced in their volcano retreat on Dana'Man , they had been fading away , though they had still retained a certain power . Things that once ruled a land could never lose that . But their glories hadbeen vanishing into history , and the more time passed , the more Lenora 's impressions of them had been dictated by memory . The Mages ' power had become a self-perpetuating myth in her own mind . Now that they had taken back their own , Lenora no longer had to rely on memory . Angel still clasped the body of the farm boy to her chest , like a mother mourning her dead child . She had cut open his skull , then she and S'Hivez had torn into his torso , searching for something vital amongst his brains and flesh . From that moment , Lenora had felt the raw power surging from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three hundred years . They had moved bones and organs aside , found what they sought and eaten it . Then they had seemed to grow , though their size never changed . They remained silent , contemplative , and everything suddenly seemed to flow through rather than around them . And later , when dawn should have been ushering away the night , Angel and S'Hivez had cursed the sky . Angel had been holding the boy 's tattered corpse ever since . The hawk had died moments after they finished rooting through the boy 's insides , and Lenora thought they would fall . But then S'Hivez had buried his arms in the creature 's neck , delving inside just as he had probed the dead boy 's carcass , and the creature had risen again , bearing them northward . Going away , a voice said . Lenora looked around , squinting against the wind . She had heard that voice intermittently since the fight with the Monks and machines , and she knew what it was : her dead , unnamed daughter 's shade still craving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face in the hawk 's stiffening hide and cried tears tainted with anger . She lifted her head slightly and her tears were caught on the wind , blown into Noreela 's skies . She hoped they would spread and fall with the next rains , casting her sorrow across plains and valleys , mountains and lakes , where vengeance would be hers . They were a long way from Robenna , and it was falling farther behind with every heartbeat . But now that she knew she would return , the heat of revenge was growing brighter within her heart . The people of Robenna had driven her out , poisoned her and murdered her unborn child . Given time , their descendants would pay . " Dreaming of death and vengeance , Lenora ? " Lenora looked up into Angel 's eyes . The Mage had crawled back along the hawk 's spine and now sat astride its huge tail , her face a hand 's width from Lenora 's . She was beautiful . Whatever time had done to her , she had undone . The might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential seemed to light her from within . Lenora tried to speak , but she was lost for words . " Do n't worry , " Angel said . She drew closer still , until her blazing eyes encompassed the whole world . " So am I. " " Mistress . . . " " I frighten you ? " Angel raised an eyebrow . Lenora averted her eyes . " That 's only right . Fear is good , Lenora . You remember the first time I touched you , casting out your pain and driving away death on that burning ship ? You were filled with fear then also , but it was fear of the Black . I saved you from death to serve me , and you 've done so ever since . But you 've become casual about your fear , as S'Hivez and I have become blase about our desires . We 've always wanted to regain magic , but maybe pain grew to suit us better . Perhaps we became too used to life as outcasts . " The Mage looked off past Lenora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that 's true , Lenora ? " " No , Mistress . You 've always been Mages , with or without magic . " Angel smiled , and Lenora felt a brief stab of jealousy-she was aware of how she looked with her bald head , scarred body and black teeth-but she cast it aside . " Lenora , you need never lie to me . You 're almost one of us . You came with us out of Noreela three hundred years ago ; you think the same way about this accursed place , and you want the same thing . So we 're almost the same . . . except you do n't have this . " She reached out and touched Lenora 's forehead . At first , the point of contact burned . Then the sensation changed from heat to one of intense cold-a chill that would freeze air and crack rock-and Lenora 's eyes closed to accept whatever Angel was handing her . There was one single image : the death of Noreela . Lenora viewed it at the speed of thought , north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and valleys , deserts and lakes , and everywhere finding the stain of destruction on the landscape . A city lay in ruins , buildings burned down into ruined heaps , streets strewn with smoking corpses , waterways polluted with rotting flesh . Farms and villages were equally devastated , their inhabitants laid out in neat lines and fixed to the land by wooden spikes . An army lay dead on a hillside , muddied armor already rusting beneath the blood spilled from the thousands of corpses . A great river was home to a hundred boats , all of them submerged , each of them filled to their watery brims with naked corpses . And all the while , Noreela itself was suffering great traumas . A mountain range swam in fire , only the highest peaks still visible above the flames . On an endless plain the ground was cracked open , but instead of fire and lava rising up , the land 's innards rolled out across the grass , giant coils of molten earth and stone hardening in the twilight and venting scampering things the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground melting away , water bursting into flame . . . The whole of Noreela was in chaos , and at its center pulsed a magic grown darker than ever before . " There , at the hub , " Angel 's voice said . " That 's us . " And Lenora saw . The fleeting visions slowed , settling toward a huge wound in the land . The wound bled . In the center of this sea of blood , floating in a boat forged from the bones of countless victims , writhed two ecstatic shadows . The Mages , joyous with the victory of vengeance found . Angel removed her finger from Lenora 's head . " The future ? " Lenora gasped . " No one sees the future . I showed you what I want of the future : Noreela drowning in blood . And with your help , S'Hivez and I will make it so . " Angel paused , looked down at her hands , then continued . " You have no idea of this power , Lenora ! It 's like being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that heat anywhere , to do anything . S'Hivez and I have been communing with shades , and they are working for us already . I can see what 's happening in the land because the shades tell me ! We know that the Monks are dead back in the valley , and the machines are still once again . We know that the Duke 's army is weak and formless in Long Marrakash . We know that night is here for Noreela , and it is our night . I can step from one side of the land to the other simply by closing my eyes . " Lenora was speechless . The energy came off Angel in waves , and the whole of Noreela pivoted on the Mage 's every utterance . " Our army is yours , " Angel said . " When it lands at Conbarma , you will be there to welcome it in and arm it with the greatest weapons we can make . And then you will take Noreela . " " You 're leaving ? " Lenora asked , aghast . Angel turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going ? " " You question me ? " " Of course not . " Angel laughed , as if dismissing Lenora 's query and her own stern answer . But she said no more , leaving Lenora wondering what the next few days would bring . War , for certain . More bloodshed and death than she had ever imagined . But with the Mages leaving the Krote army to its own devices , Lenora found doubt stoking her fear . SHE SOON LOST track of time . The constant twilight was unsettling , as if some angry god had swiped the sun from existence . To begin with , Lenora had been able to keep step with time as it drifted by . But as that day passed and they flew on into the steady night , she became confused . She found herself glancing to the west , hoping to see the smudge of a bloodred sunrise , but there was only twilight . As the Mages had taken daylight from the world , so had they removed night , leaving the land perpetually in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained . The life moon was a silvery disc , low down to the horizon in the east , nervously peering above the edge of the world . The death moon , bright and dusty yellow , rode high in the north . They flew toward it , and it seemed to leak some of its sickly hue across the landscape . There were those who believed that the moons were the remains of ancient gods , banished to the skies by a mutual hatred and destined to gather as many souls as they could in an eternal competition . The life moon was losing , and the death moon was yellow with the swell of wraiths . Soon , moon-followers believed , it would burst . Lenora had no time for such phony religions . She knew her gods , and they rode this dead beast with her . And now that the Mages were here , Noreela had no room for alternative beliefs . She was lucky ; few people ever spent time with their deities of choice . They flew on , heading northward for Conbarma and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing distract them . Noreela was a banquet spread below them , waiting to be plundered and pillaged just as they had dreamed about for three hundred years . Lenora could see larger towns now as they went farther north , splashes of illumination across the shadowed land , and twisting ribbons of light where caravans traveled the surrounding countryside . She would have so loved to land , take on one of these groups and show them the true meaning of fear . Since the battle for Conbarma , the whole land had changed , and she craved the feel of an enemy 's blood on her skin once more . But the hawk carried them on , its dead tentacles trailing behind them , gas sacs still gushing to keep them afloat , and Lenora knew that the Mages had a more encompassing revenge in mind . There would be slaughter , and blood would be spilled . But first they had an army to welcome . IT HAD BEEN dusk when they left the machines ' graveyard , and when they sighted the Bay of Cantrassa below them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had been gone for almost two full days , and she hoped that her warriors had prepared Conbarma for the arrival of the Krote ships . They would be only days away , perhaps even now passing the northernmost reaches of The Spine . Time was moving on , and war was close . As S'Hivez guided the hawk down to follow the coastline to Conbarma , Lenora found herself eager to dismount . She craved some time away from her masters . She was tired , her skin was burned by the cold wind and she felt dizzied by the power she had been close to for so long . The Mages exuded a force that sent Lenora 's tired mind into a spin . They were like holes punched in reality , so alien that even she , their servant and lieutenant , could barely endure their presence . For a while , the voice of her daughter 's shade whispered in her mind . Lenora shook her head and Angel glanced back , the Mage 's eyes a piercing blue against the twilit sky . " Conbarma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against skin . He spoke so rarely that Lenora had forgotten his voice . She leaned sideways and looked down at the sea to their right . The surging waves swallowed the death moon 's yellow light and spread it like a slick of rot . To their left she saw the port of Conbarma nestled in its own natural bay . She was glad that the fires of the battle had been extinguished . S'Hivez delved deeper into the dead hawk 's neck and brought it down , curving into a glide that would take them to Conbarma from the sea . They passed just above the waves . The hawk 's trailing tentacles skimmed the water , throwing up lines of spray , and by the time they reached the harbor there were several hawks aloft , their Krote riders armed and ready to repel an attack . Lenora managed a smile . How their moods would change when they saw what this thing brought in ! S'Hivez landed the hawk on the harbor 's edge . He extracted his hands from its dead flesh and flicked fat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the symbolism in this , but she guessed not . Angel had always been the one for that . The hawk deflated beneath them , spreading across the ground like a hunk of melting fat , and immediately its stink grew worse . Lenora glanced at the dead boy lying between the Mages . She wondered why Angel had brought him this far . Lenora slid from the hawk , but had trouble finding her feet . Nobody came to help . She looked up , hands on her knees , cringing as her legs tingled back to life , and then she realized why . None of the Krotes were looking at her . The Mages were kneeling side by side on the ground . Their hands were pressed to the dusty surface before them . S'Hivez seemed to be chanting , though it could have been the sound of the sea breaking against the mole . Light began to dance between their fingers . Dust rose . Stones scurried away from their hands like startled insects . Dozens of Krotes-those with whom she had flown from Dana'Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing pale in the moonlight as they saw who had arrived . One or two glanced at Lenora and then away again , back to the Mages , fascination overpowering the fear . It 's good to be scared , Lenora thought . That was what Angel had told her . The Mages had always been a formidable presence , but now they were so much more . There was something so dreadfully wrong about the exiled Shantasi and his ex-lover that Lenora found it difficult to look at them . It was as though light were repelled from their skin . She thought of the shapes she had seen in her vision : two wraiths aboard the bone boat on a sea of Noreelan blood .
