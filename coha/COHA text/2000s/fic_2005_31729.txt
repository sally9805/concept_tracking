It was a cigarette burn . . I could scarcely have been more shocked if I 'd discovered it on my own flesh , appearing out of nowhere , like stigmata . But it was n't on me . It was on my grass green carpet , Aisle 3 , Condolences/Get Well Soon , where I knelt , rooted in horror . " Dear God , " I said . " Dear God . Dear God . " " Girl , get a grip , " Fredreeq called out , barging through the front door of my shop , Wollie 's Welcome ! Greetings . " I can hear those ' Dear Gods ' all the way out to the parking lot . Did someone die ? Is it Mr. Bundt ? Please tell me Mr. Bundt died and I can take the day off and go to the beach . " " He 's not dead . He 's due here any minute . I was doing the final Dustbusting , and look , look --  " I waved at the carpet . " At the last inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was French Provincial . I ca n't pass this off as French Provincial . " " No . " Fredreeq loomed over me . " Cigarette burns are strictly Trailer Park . White Trash , no offense . " She leaned down , sending a wave of Shalimar my way . " That 's one hell of a burn . That is the mother of all cigarette burns . That 's a cigar burn . " I looked up at my friend and employee , took in her attire , and said it again . " Dear God . " Earrings the size of teacups dangled from delicate earlobes . Zebra- print stockings stretched from the hem of a very short , very tight skirt to a pair of velvet stiletto heels . " Yeah , I know , I 'm pushing the envelope here . " Fredreeq straightened up and moved to the cash register counter . " Is it the stockings ? You think bare legs are better ? " It was a tough call . I was n't wearingpanty hose myself , but I had on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red sweater with a dalmatian applique . It had seemed like a good outfit an hour earlier , but now I was n't so sure . I 'm over five foot eleven . Next to Fredreeq , I could look like a piece of playground equipment . " Maybe , " I said , and turned to scratch at the cigarette burn with my fingernail . " You 're black , which I always think makes the high heels-no stockings look --  " " Less slutlike ? " " No , " I said , " just more --  " At that moment , Mr. Bundt walked through the door of Wollie 's Welcome ! Greetings , setting the Welcome ! greeting bell to ringing . I jumped to my feet , planting a red high-top right on the cigarette burn . " Good morning , Mr. Bundt , " I said . " Welcome . " A pink carnation graced the lapel of his beige Big and Tall suit . There was something incandescent about Mr. Bundt , his skull as shiny as his wing tips , the few strands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , like one long eyebrow . He saw me and smiled , and for a minute I thought it was going to be all right , but then he saw Fredreeq . Well , he could hardly miss her . She was sitting on the counter , a bunched-up chunk of stocking hanging from one foot as she struggled to get a stiletto heel off the other . Mr. Bundt stared for a moment and then -- and here 's what I admired about him -- he turned and began inspecting the Welcome ! Greetings racks , beginning with Birthdays , Juvenile . If there was a Welcome ! way to handle every situation in life , this man , either from instinct or training , knew exactly what it was . Mr. Bundt was the field representative for the Welcome ! Greetings Corporation , devoting his life to inspecting all Welcome ! shops seeking an upgrade to Willkommen ! status . Willkommen ! status allowed Welcome ! shop managers to buy their shops . This was what I longed for . This was the stuff my dreams were made of . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Bundt dropped out of sight behind the Condolences/Get Well Soon rack , checking stock in the bottom drawer . I motioned to Fredreeq to hurry up with her changing routine . " Wollie , " his disembodied voice said , " is this Frank Sinatra ? " For a minute I thought he meant in the drawer . Then I realized he meant on the stereo . " Yes , " I said . " ' That 's Life . ' The song , as well as the album . " Mr. Bundt rose , his skull appearing slowly from behind the card rack . " Would n't we be safer with easy listening ? Here in Los Angeles , KXEZ . " Mr. Bundt was based in Cincinnati , yet knew every major easy listening station in his territory , North America . It was a gift . " Frank Sinatra isn't -- safe ? " I asked . " No one is safe , Miss Shelley . " His sudden use of my surname chilled me . " No album , no CD . Not for a manager who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Willkommen ! " Willkommen ! The word acted upon me like a bell to Pavlov 's dog . I stared at him , poised to respond appropriately . " KXEZ radio can be trusted , " he explained . " They have done their market research . Even their advertisements provide reassurance . Favorite albums , on the other hand , are expressions of personal taste that run the risk of --  " " Mr. Bundt , blame me , " Fredreeq called out . " I keep changing the music on her . Easy listening is very difficult for my people . " Mr. Bundt pretended to just now notice Fredreeq . She 'd moved behind the counter , where , from the waist up , she looked almost normal . " Yes , well , " he said . " The music is not for you , Ms. Munson , but for the customer . Let 's remember that key phrase in our company 's Promise to the Public : ' We are here to soothe , not to offend . ' " " Is headquarters aware that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not respond . I thought maybe he was n't sure what " banality " meant but did n't want to ask . I was a little fuzzy on it myself . I gestured to Fredreeq , who hit the stop button on the music system , cutting off Frank mid-note . For a moment there was silence , except for the sound of a distant car alarm on Sunset Boulevard . And so we were all able to hear , very clearly , when the phone machine clicked on -- the ringer having been turned off -- and a voice choked out the words , " Wollie ? It 's me . Murder , Wollie . Murder . Cold blood . He 's talking , he does n't know I 'm here , I 'm going to have to -- no . No . NO --  " Within seconds I was across the selling floor , reaching over the counter for the phone that Fredreeq was handing me as though we 'd choreographed it . " Hello ? " I said . " P.B. ? " My brother hung up . I hung up too and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything was fine , we 'd been through this dozens of times , P.B. and I , whatever it was , and it would turn out okay . Then I turned and smiled at Mr. Bundt . " Heh , " I said . It was the best I could come up with . Mr. Bundt stared at me , his eyebrows so high it looked as if he 'd had a face-lift in the last half minute . " Murder ? " he said . " Murder ? " " Nothing to worry about , " I said . " Family . . . thing . " " What is ? " " Whatever -- that was referring to . You know . Just -- family stuff . " Mr. Bundt looked doubtful . " That was a relative on the phone ? " " Yes . " " Should n't you . . . deal with it ? " " Oh , no , " I said . " He 'll call back . " " Had n't you better call him ? " " No , he's -- difficult to reach . " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state mental hospital ? No . Mr. Bundt 's eyebrows finally lowered . " I suggest you take care of this now , Miss Shelley , because we do n't want this person calling back during the hours of operation and startling the customers the way he just startled us . " " Yes , of course . " I picked up the phone and dialed the number from memory , long-distance , the 805 area code . " This hardly ever happens . " " I should hope not . Welcome ! policy frowns upon family matters intruding upon business . Is this a close relative ? " There was a tug on my heart , but I shrugged in a manner that I hoped indicated a second or third cousin . There are people made uncomfortable by the notion of a paranoid schizophrenic in the immediate family . My call was answered by a recording , which I also knew by heart , and I gave it half an ear . I watched Mr. Bundt head for the freestanding racks -- the spinners -- that display the small , independent card lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , as I myself was one of these freelancers , there was a lot at stake there . Mr. Bundt picked a card and studied it so closely he appeared to be searching for drug residue . It was one of mine , a Good Gollie , Miss Wollie . After a moment , he handed it to Fredreeq . She pointed out the writing inside . They appeared to disagree . She shook her head . He nodded . They did it again . Nodding and shaking , they headed my way . The hospital 's outgoing message droned on in my ear , as the two of them went around me , to the cash register side of the counter . Fredreeq opened the file drawer , probably to show Mr. Bundt sales statistics on the card . And that 's when his gaze fastened on the List . I 'd taped the List to the antiqued gold counter weeks ago , as a reminder of the Dating Project specifications . Fredreeq and I had become so accustomed to seeing it , we 'd forgotten about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone , a trickle of sweat sliding south between my breasts . Please God , let him go blind , I prayed . Not forever , of course . For fifteen or twenty seconds . Then I sprang into action , slapping my hand down on the counter right smack on top of the List . Mr. Bundt peered at it , trying to read between my splayed fingers , then said , " Miss Shelley , what on earth is written here that 's not fit for public consumption ? " " Mr. Bundt , " I said , " I promise you the public never sees that ; come around to this side of the counter and you 'll see how impossible it is to read it from here . " He stood his ground . " What is it , Miss Shelley ? " Fredreeq piped up . " Okay , I confess . These are soul mate qualifications . I 'm looking for a soul mate . " " Fredreeq --  " I said . Mr. Bundt frowned . " I thought you were married . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long-suffering husband . " Working here at Welcome ! Greetings showed me I had real high professional standards and real low personal ones . So I made a list . I 'm finding my next man strictly by the book . " She moved my hand aside , slapped a file on top of the List , and slid it down an inch . " You see , number one is A Good Name . " Mr. Bundt said , " A good reputation , you mean . " " Okay , yeah . " Fredreeq smiled . Mr. Bundt reached beyond her and moved the file down an inch . " Number two : Not a Convicted Felon . Surely that 's not a recurring problem , Ms. Munson ? " I reached over the counter and slid the file over the List again . Fredreeq picked up a receipt book , and began to stamp pages with the Have A Nice Day stamp we used to spruce up our receipts . It seemed an odd thing to do . Mr. Bundt reached over and moved the file . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fredreeq stamped him on the hand . Hard . I mean , it must have hurt . I gasped . Mr. Bundt jumped backward , and I moved in on him , solicitous , but also wedging my body in front of the List . I offered turpentine to remove the ink , but he waved me away . As he waved , his right hand showed the word " Nice . " " Let 's lose this . " I turned to the List and ripped it off the counter . " There . Gone . " The rest of the inspection tour went better , but then , it could hardly have gone worse . I managed to keep him away from the cigarette burn , which , I realized , must have occurred during Uncle Theo 's Wednesday Night Poetry Reading , and somehow escaped my notice for thirty-two hours . Mr. Bundt found no fault with my Passover/Easter decorations , although he did raise an eyebrow at my small selection of seasonal books , Baby 's First Easter Story , A Child 's Haggadah , and Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to call my peripherals beyond reproach : wrapping paper , sealing wax , snow globes , crystal balls , astrological calendars , collectible watches , bookends , bookplates , bookmarks , sterling silver yo-yos , and dollhouse furniture . The other forty-one Good Gollie , Miss Wollie cards on their own spinner passed muster , then Mr. Bundt checked the books and asked if I had additional resources , in the happy event that I won my Willkommen ! upgrade . " Because I must tell you , most of our franchise candidates are more fiscally stable . " " Mr. Bundt , you do n't have to worry . I 've been approved for four small business loans and I have a -- a nest egg -- earmarked for the down payment . I 'm stable . I 'm fiscal . " " Yes , well . Do n't count your nest egg before you 're hatched . You have two more inspections prior to Decision Day . " He nodded toward the wall calendar , where the Monday after Easter was highlighted . " These next inspections , however , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes people ? " " To observe the shop in action , " he said , " through the eyes of ' a customer . ' Should you achieve Willkommen ! status , supervision will cease , so we must determine now your level of fitness . " Mr. Bundt leaned in , smelling of breath mints . " No more morbid family phone calls , Wollie . You will not wish to remind anyone of the error made with your predecessor . " My predecessor , Aldwyn Allen , two weeks after Aldwyn 's Welcome ! Greetings had been upgraded to Aldwyn 's Willkommen ! Greetings , had hanged himself . In the shop . Nobody knew why , nor had I been able to find out exactly where it had happened . I liked to think it was the utility closet , the only piece of the premises I had no emotional attachment to . I walked Mr. Bundt out to his Lincoln Continental , chatting to divert his attention from his surroundings . The shop was on Sunset Boulevard , east of Highland , smack in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mini-market called Bodega Bob , Loo Fong 's Chinese Fast Food , Neat Nails Plus , and a Colonel Sanders knockoff , Plucky Chicken . The good thing about the location was , there were no other greeting card shops for 2.7 miles . The bad news was , this little piece of Hollywood was not optimum in terms of sales . " Seedy , " an old boyfriend once called it . Fredreeq put it another way : " It 's like your shop was headed for the suburbs and got off at the wrong bus stop . " It was n't the prettiest corner of the world , but I could n't afford the franchise if it were . And my philosophy was , hookers need greeting cards too . There were no hookers this morning , just a man sleeping in a wrecked red Fiero in front of Loo Fong 's , whom Mr. Bundt , by the grace of God , seemed not to notice . Corporate policy stated my jurisdiction included the shop and all public areas connected to it , but you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , I hugged Fredreeq , dodging her earrings and absorbing her Shalimar . She patted my back . " Yeah , I know , I 'm a saint . Saint Bullshit . What was I gon na do , watch you tell him whose List that really is , Miss Compulsive Honesty ? Okay , I 'm gon na go put myself back together . " She pulled her panty hose out of her pocket and headed toward the back room , then stopped with her hand on the doorknob . It was my pice de rsistance , that doorknob , a ceramic lemon attached to a door that was painted as a tree , set in a wall-length mural of a lemon grove . " Wollie , is P.B. all right ? " " Yes . I mean- " With a sense of unease , I picked up the phone and pressed redial . " He 's been off his ziprasidone because of his foot thing , which is why he 's talking murder . He 's delusional again . " The hospital 's after-hours recording greeted me once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Still too early . The thing is , I do n't want to leave a bunch of messages . Once he 's back on his meds , these episodes just embarrass him . " " Well , you 're the boss , Wollie . " Fredreeq disappeared into the back room , her voice trailing off as she said , " But to quote somebody famous , just ' cause your brother is paranoid , does n't mean that somebody is n't dead . " Despite repeated attempts , by early evening I still had n't talked to my brother . The psych tech on P.B. 's ward told me he seemed fine , but refused to take incoming calls . I was dressing for a date in my apartment , a one-room-pluskitchenette that barely contained the old grand piano I lived with . The apartment 's main appeal was its price and its proximity to my shop-sixty-nine steps if you used all back entrances . On the radio , the closing music of the talk show Love Junkies swelled . " Chemistry shmemistry , " said Dr. Cookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly manic edge as she raced against her own closing music . " You wan na get laid , go for chemistry . You want the long haul , the ring on your finger , go for character . The whole trick to keeping the guy is finding the right guy in the first place . How ? Honey , I could write a book . I am writing a book . How to Avoid Getting Dumped All the Time , hitting the stands next Valentine 's Day , and- " My phone rang . I turned off the radio , feeling the thrill I always get when I hear a reference to myself on the air . I was the research for How to Avoid Getting Dumped All the Time . Well , me and fourteen other women across the United States . We were the Dating Project . " Hello ? " I said , but there was silence on the other end of the phone . " P.B. ? " A guttural noise answered me . It could have been the growl of an animal . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexplicable chill . As though a flame had been extinguished . " P.B. ? " Click . Silence .
