WATTSTAX The 1973 concert film loses some soul as a rerelease R , 104 mins . ( Sony Pictures Repertory ) If you want to see what really early break dancing looked like-we 're talking prehistoric-check out the moment in Wattstax when Rufus Thomas , the rambunctious jester of Memphis soul , performs a cocky little number called " The Breakdown " and a handful of kids in the audience begin to bend , flop , and shake their limbs as if electric currents were zapping through them . The dance is pure play ( a few of these impromptu groove artists wear hats twice as big as their heads ) , yet it 's clear now , in a way that it was n't then , that the daffy street movements would soon begin to fuse into something far grander : the cultural revolution of hip-hop . This particular scene unfolded on the sunny afternoon of Aug. 20 , 1972 , during a seven-hour concert held at the Los Angeles Coliseum to commemorate the Watts riots of 1965 . The music was soul , blues , und @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert King , the Staples Singers , and Isaac Hayes , and barely a white face could be seen in the stands . At the time , the notion of 110,000 African Americans turning out for their own Woodstock seemed nothing less than a triumph of solidarity . Yet if you go to see Wattstax , the 1973 film of the event that is being rereleased for the first time in 30 years ( it has never been available on video or DVD ) , it may strike you that what once looked like an exultant expression of black unity now carries , in hindsight , an eerie aura of segregation . Any 1970s nostalgia is tempered by a grateful awareness that we are now , in many ways , less divided . I wish I could say that Wattstax was an ecstatic soul celebration , but most of the performances , while enjoyable , fall short of memorable . Two of the best are n't even from the Coliseum concert : The Emotions do a delirious spiritual at a local church , and Johnnie Taylor , singing " Jody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On stage in the middle of the Coliseum football field , most of the other performers , such as Little Milton and Luther Ingram , burn less brightly , though Rufus Thomas has a tremendous bit in which he waves the audience out onto the field to dance to " Do the Funky Chicken . " The new " special edition " also includes a climactic appearance by Isaac Hayes , which was cut entirely from the original film due to a dispute over music rights . His performance of " Shaft " is far less dramatic than his signature outfit : bare chest bedecked with gold chains-I mean real chains-that make him look like Mandingo dressed by Karl Lagerfeld . Wattstax , like Woodstock before it , presents a music festival as a larger political statement . Jesse Jackson , in full " fro , introduces the concert by exhorting the crowd to shout " I ... am ... somebody , " and the director , Me Stuart , cuts from performance sequences to encounter-group dialogues with Watts residents to clips of Richard Pryor improvising at a local bar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his persecution . Yet it must be said that the movie , arriving as it did on the cusp between civil rights optimism and the street fire of blaxploitation , now plays with a strangely desultory air . Three decades ago in America , a stadium concert that featured musicians of universal passion could still bill itself , proudly , as separate but equal . To see Wattstax today is to realize why that moment had to end . B <p>
