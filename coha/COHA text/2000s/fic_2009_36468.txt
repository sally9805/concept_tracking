Paris , September 1997 , Monday Afternoon <p> AimTe Leduc 's fingers paused on the keyboard of her laptop as she felt a sudden unease but it vanished as quickly as the mist that curled up under the Pont Neuf . At least , she thought , thanks to the cleaning lady , the chandelier gleamed , the aroma of beeswax polish hovered , and Leduc Detective 's office shone . For once . It should impress her high-powered client , the Private Banque Morel 's administrator , who was due in ten minutes . <p> AimTe checked for lint on her Dior jacket , a flea-market find . She heard a footstep and looked up expectantly . <p> A woman in her late thirties stood in the doorway to the office . She was a tall , light-complected mulatto , wearing a denim skirt and clutching oversize sunglasses in her hand . She stepped inside , her gaze taking in the nineteenth-century high ceilings and carved moldings as well as the array of computers . <p> " This place is n't what I expected , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AimTe did n't recognize . <p> " Maybe you 're in the wrong place , Mademoiselle , " AimTe said , irritated . " Our firm handles computer security only . " She ran her chipped red fingernails over the Rolodex for the card of a female private detective in the Paris region . <p> " Non . " The woman waved the card away . She 's persistent , AimTe thought . And for a brief moment , as the breeze fluttered through the open window and a siren whined outside on rue du Louvre , AimTe sensed that she was being subjected to a curious scrutiny . It was as if this woman was measuring and found her , like the office , wanting . <p> AimTe glanced at her Tintin watch impatiently . " As I told you- " AimTe 's cell phone beeped . " Excuse me , " she said and dug in her bag , found it , and listened to the message . The client she expected was in a taxi ... minutes away . <p> " The owner of this establishment knew my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now more pronounced . <p> Even after all this time , former clients called expecting to find him , AimTe thought sadly . " You 're referring to my father , Jean-Claude Leduc , " she said . " But he passed away several years ago . " She used a euphemism instead of graphically describing his death during a routine surveillance in the Place Vend ( me from an exploding bomb . <p> " Passed away ? " The woman blinked . " And you 're his daughter ? " <p> AimTe nodded . " We 've put the old case files in storage . DTsolTe . " <p> " But you do n't understand . " The woman tilted her head to the side , gauging something , ignoring AimTe 's words . Her fingers picked at the strap of her straw bag . <p> " Understand ? Mademoiselle , I am waiting for a client who is due any moment . " She checked her phone again . " Make an appointment , and then I 'll see what I can do for you . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the photo behind AimTe 's desk . It was of her father caught in time : younger , his tie loose , grinning . The one AimTe kept to remind her of what he 'd looked like alive , not the way she 'd last seen him , charred limbs on the morgue 's stainless-steel table all that remained after the explosion . <p> " My father- " <p> " Our father , " the woman interrupted . " I 'm your sister , AimTe . " <p> The phone fell from AimTe 's hand . <p> " But I do n't have a sister . " <p> " It took time to find this place , to make sure , " the woman said . Her voice quavered , her confidence evaporating . " And to summon the courage to come here . I need to talk with you . " <p> AimTe steadied herself . " There 's some misunderstanding , Mademoiselle . You 're ... " <p> " Mireille Leduc . " <p> Stunned , AimTe looked for some resemblance in the almond-shaped eyes , the honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth : that full pout of the lips , those white teeth . Could her father have had another child ? <p> " You have proof ? I 'm sorry , but you walk in here and claim you 're my sister , " AimTe said . " How do I know you 're ... that what you claim is true ? " <p> " You 're shocked , " said Mireille , her voice urgent . " Me too . I had no idea until three weeks ago . During the coup d'Ttat , I had to leave Haiti . I only found out .... " <p> " Haiti ? " AimTe shook her head . " Papa never went to Haiti . " <p> " Your father and my mother had a relationship in Paris , before you were born , " the woman said . " I can show you photos . " <p> AimTe felt the air being sucked out of her lungs . Glints of afternoon light refracted from the prisms of the chandelier into myriad dancing lights . It was as if she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . <p> The wire cage elevator whined up to the office landing and rumbled to a halt . Her client had arrived to tell her the verdict . Would Morel , a prestigous private bank , extend Leduc Detective 's data security contract ? <p> " I never knew my father , " said Mireille . Her mouth pursed . " Was it a one night stand or a grand amour ... who knows ? " <p> " That 's not like Papa . He would n't have fathered a child and just- " <p> " Mademoiselle Leduc ? " A smiling middle-aged woman in a navy pantsuit knocked on the frosted glass panel of the open door . " Am I disturbing you ? " <p> " Of course not , Madame Delmas , please come in . " AimTe forced a smile , stuck her trembling hand in her pocket , and gestured to a Louis Quinze chair with her other . " The data analysis report 's ready . " <p> Perspiration dampened AimTe 's collar . " Why do n't you start reading the report while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mireille paused next to AimTe on the scuffed wood of the landing , a vulnerable look on her face . " Maman went back to Haiti . I do n't know if he knew she was pregnant . " <p> A cough came from inside AimTe 's office . One did n't keep a client like Madame Delmas waiting . <p> The woman calling herself Mireille Leduc gripped AimTe 's hand hard . Hers was as hot as fire . A thin red string encircled her wrist . " Mesamey , " she said . <p> " I do n't understand , " AimTe said , her voice low . <p> " Mesamey is the Krey=l word ... I do n't how you say it in French . I 've only been here a week . Would you say surprised ? " <p> AimTe felt a frisson course through her . " But what do you want ? " she asked . <p> " Please , I lost my papers . I did n't know who else to ask . " <p> " Papers ... you mean you 're illegal ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're sisters . I am in some trouble . I thought my father could help . This man who 's been helping me gave me a file , and .... " <p> Madame Delmas 's chair scraped on the floor , a fax machine whirred , and the office phone rang . <p> " I 'll wait for you in the corner cafT , " Mireille said . " You 'll meet me , AimTe ? " <p> What else could she do ? AimTe nodded . Her eyes followed Mireille down the dim spiral staircase until the last glimpse of her curly hair disappeared . She could still feel the heat of Mireille 's hand on hers . Then she realized she did n't know her address or even how to reach her . <p> Time to get to the bottom of this , AimTe thought , emerging from her building into the warm air of the rue du Louvre . The limestone building fatades , with their wrought iron balconies and pots of geraniums , shimmered in the late-afternoon sun . AimTe 's heels clicked over the uneven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaiming " New leads in Princess Di 's death . " September 1997 , two weeks after Princess Di 's accident in Pont de l'Alma , and the media would n't quit . Nom de Dieu , she thought , why could n't the paparazzi let the poor woman rest in peace ? <p> A group of laughing schoolchildren raced by , joking about their recent vacations . September was time for la rentrTe , the return to work and school , when the city emerged from the summer doldrums like a dog shaking its wet fur . <p> AimTe hurried into the corner cafT , searching for Mireille . Only a few tables by the window were occupied : two financial types in business suits huddled in conversation , an old couple with their dog arguing over an article in Le Soir , and the locksmith in his overalls , his heavy-lidded eyes semi-closed , at the counter . <p> No Mireille . <p> Suspicion mingled with disappointment . The slim thread of hope that Mireille might really be her sister began to fray . She 'd always wanted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true . Yet how nanve to credit a stranger who walked into her office , promised proof , and vanished . <p> Grow up ! she told herself . She had to grow up . And she repressed the longing she 'd always felt for family , any family . <p> " Bonsoir , Zazie , " she said to the young girl with red hair and a splash of freckles who smiled at her from behind the counter she was stocking with Orangina bottles . " Has a woman asked for me ? Curly hair , light caramel-colored skin , wearing a denim skirt ? " <p> " Un moment , AimTe . " Zazie helped out in the cafT after school while her mother tallied accounts and her father took deliveries . Frugal and close-knit , in true Auvergnat fashion , the whole family worked together . <p> " So was she here , Zazie ? " <p> Zazie shrugged . " Better ask Maman , she 'll be back in a minute . " <p> Maybe Mireille had stepped out for a moment but would return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile floor , which was littered with sugar wrappers and cigarette butts . She wanted proof of the truth of the woman 's claim . If Mireille was working a scam , expecting money , she 'd be disappointed , AimTe thought , as she considered Leduc Detective 's finances . <p> " Your usual , AimTe ? " Zazie asked . <p> " Make it a double . " AimTe hiked her bag up on her shoulder and nodded to the locksmith next to her , who was nursing a beer . The faint stain of twilight tinged the trees and traffic leading to the Pont Neuf . She scanned the outdoor pavement : only anonymous passersby and Maurice , the one-armed veteran news vendor , selling newspapers at the kiosk . <p> " So you 're working tonight , AimTe ? " <p> There was a click and bubble of steam as the dark liquid dripped into a demitasse cup . Tacked on the wall were children 's stick-figure crayon drawings . <p> " I 've got a new client . " AimTe twisted the blond highlighted strands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her new look , responsible for a big check to the stylist at the coiffeuse . <p> She scanned the cafT again , looking through the windows to the shadowy street . Still no Mireille . Her impatience mounted . <p> " Try to remember , Zazie . Was there a woman with sunglasses , big ones ? A tall woman with light brown curly hair ? " <p> Zazie lifted the demitasse of espresso onto a small white saucer . " Lots of people come in here . " She hefted a thick textbook onto the counter . " I 've got a geography test tomorrow . " <p> AimTe unwrapped a sugar cube , stirred her coffee with the little spoon and wished she had a cigarette to go with it . Too bad she 'd quit . Second time this month . <p> Zazie chewed her pencil , then leaned forward as if confiding a secret . " AimTe , " she said , " I may have a case for you . " <p> " Really ? " AimTe smiled . <p> " Oui . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in geography . " <p> AimTe nodded , noticing the hint of mascara on Zazie 's lashes . Zazie must be twelve or thirteen now . " You like him , Zazie ? " <p> Zazie blushed . " Paul 's father went out to buy cigarettes and never came home . " <p> A child 's cry came from somewhere in the cafT 's kitchen . <p> " His father left one day , AimTe . Just like that ! " <p> AimTe averted her eyes . Like her own American mother , a seventies radical . A mother who had n't been home when eight-year-old AimTe returned from school that rainy March afternoon . Just a note telling her to stay at the next-door neighbors ' . And an empty armoire . <p> " Paul thinks his father is a secret agent who had to go on a mission . " <p> More likely a deadbeat dad who skipped out . <p> " Could you find Paul 's father , AimTe ? " <p> " That 's the flics ' job , Zazie , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Through the cafT 's window AimTe saw a flash of denim . But this woman was blonde . Not Mireille . <p> " Paul wo n't go to school . He 's waiting for his father .... " Zazie paused , wide-eyed . " I saw his mother at the market , crying . You 're a detective . Ca n't you find him , AimTe ? " <p> AimTe sighed , seeking an excuse . The sharp ache she herself felt , a knife-edged pain-wanting to know what had happened to her own mother-never stopped . <p> Zazie pushed another espresso toward her . " Paul 's got an allowance ; he can pay you . Please , AimTe , " she pleaded . <p> " No promises , Zazie . It depends on whether my friend still works at the Commissariat . " <p> She pulled out a black lipstick tube , swiped Chanel Red across her lips and blotted them with a cafT napkin . Again , AimTe scanned the people walking by on the pavement . Still no Mireille . <p> She heard another cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates . <p> A moment later , Virginie , Zazie 's mother appeared , hefting a baby on her on an ample hip . Smears of honey glistened on the baby 's cheek . <p> " Do you remember a woman who came in here looking for me , Virginie ? " <p> AimTe repeated her description . <p> Virginie brushed a wisp of hair from her forehead . " Last time I 'll serve her ! " Virginie 's eyebrows shot up in disapproval . " She did n't say a word , just pointed her finger . " <p> AimTe kept her mouth shut . <p> " Like she 's too good to talk with the likes of me , like I 'm the hired help , " Virginie said . <p> " Pointed to what , Virginie ? " <p> Virginie reached for a cafT napkin wedged between the pastis and Dubonnet bottles on the shelf in front of the beveled mirror . <p> " She left this for you . " Virginie 's mouth puckered in a moue of distaste . <p> " You mean that lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The one in the raincoat ? She ran away . " <p> AimTe leaned over the counter . Sometimes she got more sense out of Zazie than from her harried mother . <p> " What happened , Zazie ? " <p> " The motorcycle pulled up . " Zazie gestured out the window to a small alley . " She looked scared . Then she ducked behind the counter . I saw her bend down . " <p> " Like she was hiding ? " <p> " Then she ran away . Out the back door away from the motorcycle . " Zazie shook her head . " I did n't know she 'd been waiting for you , AimTe . " <p> The napkin was marked with a damp brown circular coffee stain . She turned it over and saw her name written on it . She unfolded the napkin and read the scribbled words " Loge B. 2A5C , 61 rue Buffon . " The Latin Quarter . <p> " AimTe ? " Zazie asked , tugging her sleeve . " Do you know her ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Zazie . " She palmed a ten-franc note into Zazie 's hand . " Big sisters have it tough . Treat yourself to an Orangina . " <p> AimTe turned the ignition key of her faded pink Vespa scooter . She stepped on the kickstart pedal , popped into first gear , and edged the Vespa into the traffic crawling past the Louvre 's Cour CarrTe and into a cloud of diesel exhaust from the Number 74 bus . She wished she 'd worn jeans instead of the Dior pencil skirt and heels . <p> She drove by pet shops and bouquinistes , the secondhand book stalls on the banks of the Seine . On her left , Notre Dame 's gray shrouded , scaffolding-wrapped hulk was in the midst of a seemingly eternal cleaning . As she crossed the Petit Pont to Saint Michel , the Seine beneath flowed khaki-green flecked with copper in the last rays of the sun . <p> On the Left Bank she bypassed tree-lined Boulevard Saint Michel heading up rue Saint Jacques , a part of the ancient pilgrimage route to Compostela in Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Ages until the nineteenth century classes had been taught in Latin . The streets narrowed in the Latin Quarter , one of the oldest of Paris , home to churches , Roman ruins , universities , the Grandes Ecoles , book stores , and , now , research facilities . It was still an intellectual center . The cobbled passages were traversed by students spilling out of small bars tucked into medieval two-story timbered buildings . Strains of remix from the DJ du mode wafted in the warm air , along with the fumes from the cigarettes everyone smoked . <p> By the time she had woven her scooter through the warren of streets below Montagne Sainte-GeneviFve , darkness had descended . Her knuckles ached from squeezing the brake levers on the steep inclines . All the way here , she had wondered who Mireille had run from and why she 'd left an address on a napkin for her . <p> AimTe located 61 , rue Buffon , opposite the nineteenth-century Natural History Museum , which stood in the leafy gardens of the Jardin des Plantes . Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall plastered with old , curling advertisements posted despite the faded DEFENSE D'AFFICHER warning . A small weathered plaque said OSTEOLOGIQUE ANATOMIE COMPAR+E . It was the comparative anatomy research facility . She pulled out the napkin and entered 2A5C on the digicode keypad . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
