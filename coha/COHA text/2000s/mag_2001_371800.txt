The videotaped bin Laden coffee klatch has the distinctive atmosphere of evil with its feet up  --  sated , self-satisfied , laughing . It 's a disturbing impression . <P> When evil performs in public , it usually comes onstage in full makeup , with lurid lighting and horrid effects , riding a horse backward . Here we see evil backstage , with its makeup off  --  the smirking , kicked-back thuggishness , say , of gangsters twirling pasta and gloating over the success of the St. Valentine 's Day Massacre . <P> Mafiosi , of course , do not punctuate their conversation with " Allah is great ! " and " Praise Allah ! " The bin Laden home movie mixes ejaculations of piety with postgame Islamic towel snapping and a chillingly cynical amusement at the sucker martyrs . Combine the piety and the thug 's mirth , and you get something of that lounging insolence with which Satan , at the opening of the Book of Job , answers God 's " Whence comest thou ? " with : " From going to and fro in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " A sneering theological swagger . Evil usually feels comfortable with itself . If it had doubts , it would not be evil . <P> You can not watch the tape without thinking of Hannah Arendt 's famous phrase " the banality of evil . " Because 9/11 has caused such reverberations in the world , people have subconsciously endowed bin Laden with the size and force , the diabolical cunning , of a supervillain or , in some parts of the world , of a superhero . The video produces a severely diminishing effect  --  something like listening to the Nixon Oval Office tapes ( though radically different orders of crime are under discussion ) . The grainy video brings down the image of bin Laden in something of the way that the Taliban blew up the giant statues of Buddha at Bamiyan . <P> Arendt coined the term banality of evil in order to try to define the ( terrifying ) ordinariness of Adolf Eichmann , the Nazi bureaucrat who helped manage Hitler 's killing machine . Each age , it may be , gets its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run the Nazi regime 's program of industrial extermination . In the videotape , bin Laden seems to radiate  --  if that is the word  --  a different sort of banality : the unexpected ordinariness of his awfulness . <P> Is it the conversation of a madman ? No . An evil genius ? Part of the deflation is an atmosphere of ineffable near-stupidity . The recollected premonitions in dreams about soccer teams made up of airplane pilots , for example . Stupidity is evil 's dimwit half-brother . It dawns on you as you watch the tape that bin Laden may be like one of those not quite bright real-life hoods who strut around with the Godfather movies unreeling in their minds , the theme music playing in their inner ears ; Al Pacino has given them the dialogue , a myth of themselves . Bin Laden is the John Gotti of jihad.
