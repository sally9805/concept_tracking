North and South Divide // AMERICA IS DIFFERENT . Today , when American " exceptionalism , " as it is called , has become the subject of academic study , the United States , except in wealth and military power , is less exceptional than it was in the years when it was to be reached only by sailing ship across the Atlantic . Then , before American culture had been universalised by Hollywood , the technology of television , and the international music industry , America really was a different place and society from the Old World , which had given it birth . Europeans who made the voyage noted differences of every sort , not only political and economic , but human and social as well . Americans were bigger than Europeans-even their slaves were bigger than their African forebears-thanks to the superabundance of food that American farms produced . American parents allowed their children a freedom not known in Europe ; they shrank from punishing their sons and daughters in the ways European fathers and mothers did . Ulysses S. Grant , the future general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , recalled in his memoirs that there was " never any scolding or punishment by my parents , no objection to rational enjoyments such as fishing , going to the creek a mile away to swim in summer , taking a horse and visiting my grandparents in the adjoining county , fifteen miles off , skating on the ice in winter , taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on the ground . " It was a description of childhood as experienced in most prosperous country-dwelling families of the period . The Grants were modestly well-to-do , Jesse Grant , the future president 's father , having a tanning business and also working an extensive property of arable land and forest . But then most established American families , and the Grants had come to the New World in 1630 , were prosperous . It was prosperity that underlay their easy way with their offspring , since they were not obliged to please neighbours by constraining their children . The children of the prosperous were nevertheless well-behaved because they were schooled and churchgoing . The two went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably indulgent father though he was not a doctrinal Christian . Churchgoing America , overwhelmingly Protestant before 1850 , needed to read the Bible , and north of the Mason-Dixon line , which informally divided North from South , four-fifths of Americans could read and write . Almost all American children in the North , and effectively all in New England , went to school , a far higher proportion than in Europe , where literacy even in Britain , France , and Germany lay around two-thirds . America was also becoming college-going , with the seats of higher education , Harvard , Yale , Columbia , Princeton , the College of William and Mary , established and flourishing . America could afford to fund and run colleges because it was already visibly richer than Europe , rich agriculturally , though it was not yet a food-exporting economy , and increasingly rich industrially . It was a newspaper country with a vast newspaper-reading public and a large number of local and some widely distributed city newspapers . Its medical profession was large and skilful , and the inventiveness and mechanical aptitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So too was the vibrant and passionate nature of its politics . America was already a country of ideas and movements , highly conscious of its birth in freedom and its legacy of revolution ; anti-imperialism had been its founding principle . During the decades before the Civil War , America was experiencing an industrial boom and its own distinctive industrial revolution . England 's industrial revolution had taken its impetus from the development of steam power , fuelled by the island 's abundant deposits of coal and directed to the exploitation of its large deposits of metal ores . Early-nineteenth-century America was also beginning to dig coal and iron ore , of which its soil contained enormous quantities , but at the outset it was two other sources of power which drove its proliferating factories and workshops : waterpower and wood . The rivers of New England , New York , and Pennsylvania were harnessed to turn waterwheels and its extensive forests to supply timber for burning . In Europe the days were long gone when forests could be cut down to supply heat . The Continent , outside Scandinavia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , trees were still an encumbrance which had to be felled to provide land for farming , but which also , when sawn , provided the raw material for every sort of building and manufactured item . America needed deforestation if its soils were to be farmed in the future , and in that process industrialisation and land clearing went hand in hand . During the 1830s and later , New York City consumed several million loads of wood every year , cut and stripped from Maine and New Jersey . It was only gradually that mines were dug and extended , originally by immigrants from the English coalfields and Welsh valleys , but by 1860 production in the Pennsylvanian anthracite fields had increased fortyfold in thirty years . By that date a distinctive economic geography of the United States could be discerned , with expanding industrial regions centred on New York and Philadelphia , exploited coalfields in New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and the Allegheny region of the Appalachians , a developing industrial region around Pittsburgh , and a thriving textile and engineering zone in southern New England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force had fallen below 40 percent , while it remained above 80 percent in the South . An economic map would show that there was no industrial centre south of a line drawn from St. Louis to Louisville to Baltimore ; in the South nine-tenths of the population lived in the countryside , but in the North only a quarter . Timber also provided the steam power for paddleboats , which by 1850 were to be seen on every navigable waterway , and the railway locomotives , which were becoming familiar on the tracks which were stretching out to link all the more important cities to one another and to the seaboard ports . By 1850 there were 9,000 miles of track in the United States ; by 1860 , 30,000 . Rivers and then canals had been the means of transportation and distribution in the early stages of the boom . Canal boats and river steamers were rapidly overtaken in importance by the railroad . By 1850 , America had surpassed Britain , home of the railroad revolution , in miles of operating track ; indeed , American track mileage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The United States was still an industrial client of Europe , particularly Britain , from which most manufactured goods came , but that was due to Britain 's head start in the industrial revolution . By the end of the century this would no longer be the case . In the meantime , America was ceasing to be a predominately rural country and becoming an urban one . At the outbreak of the Civil War , America had more country-dwellers than town-dwellers , many more in the South , but the trend was for town-dwellers to outnumber country-dwellers . Cities were being founded at a breakneck rate and growing at exponential speed . The old cities of colonial settlement , Boston , New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , retained their importance , but new cities were appearing and expanding , particularly beyond the Appalachian chain and even beyond the Mississippi ; for a time Cincinnati promised to be the most important of the new metropolises , but it was rapidly overtaken by Chicago , which grew from a population of 5,000 in 1840 to 109,000 in 1860 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the United States itself , whose population increased from 5,306,000 in 1800 to 23,192,000 in 1850 . Part of the increase came from migration , though the decades of mass immigration lay in the future ; most of it was the result of a high birthrate . The astonishing productivity of the United States furnished work for all who chose to stay in the towns , while the abundant availability of land for settlement in the new states beyond the Appalachians and the Mississippi attracted would-be farmers , or employed farmers seeking better land , in large numbers . In whichever direction a visitor to the United States looked , the country was growing . // It was not that America was giving up the land . On the contrary : in the twenty years before 1860 enormous areas of the subcontinent were put under the plough ; but the work was done by internal migrants who abandoned their homes on the thin , worked-out soils of New England , Virginia , and the Carolinas to trek westward into the new land in and beyond the Mississippi and Missouri valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public land was sold at $2 an acre , with a quarter to be paid down and four years to pay off the residue . By 1820 the price had gone down to $1.25 an acre . Land was sold in subdivisions of a section of 640 acres . By 1832 the government accepted bids for a quarter of a quarter section , 40 acres . In 1862 Congress passed the Homestead Act , which allowed a settler free possession of 160 acres if farmed for five years . The legislation effectively transferred eighty million acres of public land into private hands , and accommodated half a million people . American land policy was the making of such states as Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois , the Middle West proper . As settlement moved on to the more distant lands of the prairies in Iowa , Kansas , and Nebraska , the first comers got the best of the deal . The prairies were settled during an uncharacteristic era of moist climate , which conferred bountiful crops on the hardworking . By the twentieth century , desiccation had set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not exclusively by free men . Cotton profits pulled plantation owners westward into new lands during the period 1830-50 , particularly onto the dark , rich soils of the " black belt " of Alabama and Mississippi , but even as far away as the river lands of Texas . It is calculated that 800,000 slaves were moved , by their owners , from the Atlantic coast farther inland between 1800 and 1860. // America was growing not only in population but also in wealth . Not yet an exporting country , except of cotton , its enormous internal market consumed all that could be produced . The whole of America was industrialising in the 1850s , particularly those parts settled since the eighteenth century : New England , Pennsylvania , New York , and some of Virginia . The industrialisation had its centre in Connecticut , which had both excellent river and canal connections with other parts of the region , and plentiful waterpower to drive factory machinery . Even as a pre-industrial economy , America wanted and bought the output of New England 's workshops and factories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . It was in Connecticut that what came to be called " the American system of manufacture " first established itself . The American system also became known as the " system of interchangeable parts , " which is exactly descriptive . A well-educated and well-trained workforce learnt to make parts in metal or wood to such narrow tolerances that one manufactured item could be assembled from a random selection of parts . The American army 's rifle , the Springfield , was such a product . It so impressed British visitors to the Springfield armoury that the British government bought the appropriate machinery to equip its armoury at Enfield for the Crimean War . When in 1861 the American government was gripped by demand for large quantities of rifles , the Enfield armoury supplied much of the need . Because the Springfield and Enfield products were manufactured in almost the same calibre , the Enfield being slightly larger , American cartridges fitted both quite satisfactorily , so well in fact that Union soldiers did not differentiate between Springfields and Enfields . Many good republicans thus went into battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown on the plate of the lock . The " system of interchangeable parts " also enabled the manufacture and assembly of clocks , watches , household and agricultural machinery , and the increasing number of labour-saving devices which American inventiveness brought to the world . America was chronically short of labour , both in town and country , so that any device that could multiply the work of a pair of hands was rapidly adopted . The sewing machine , which allowed housewives to dress themselves and their families at home or the local dressmaker to set up as a businesswoman , was widely adopted across America as soon as it was perfected . American farmers meanwhile were buying reaping machines , binders , and seed drills which could perform the tasks for which labour was lacking . The most significant element of mechanisation antedated the nineteenth century . It was the invention by Eli Whitney in 1793 of the cotton gin , a machine that separated the cotton fibre from the seed on which it grew , the boll . The gin revolutionised cotton production . A process which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a pound of cotton could be completed by the machine in a few minutes . Little was turned into manufactured goods in the South , which , having sent raw cotton north to be spun , then had to buy it back as woven cloth or finished apparel . // The South 's dependence on the industrial resources of the North underlay a visible social split . The South remained , as the North had been in the eighteenth century , agrarian and rural , with most Southerners living on the land and working as subsistence farmers , raising corn , hogs , and root crops , most of which they consumed themselves or sold locally , while the Northerners began during the nineteenth century to migrate from the land to towns in which they found wage-paying work . The readiness during the war of the two sides to fraternise at times of truce , formal and informal , and the willingness of both to be taken prisoner dispose of the idea that North and South were markedly different societies ; despite the war , Americans remained American . Accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Southerners spoke , the soldiers of the two sides resembled each other much more than they differed . Both , in overwhelming majority , were country boys , in their twenties , farmers ' sons who had left their land to join the army . Nevertheless , North and South were different , and the differences showed in the character of the armies . // Southerners were almost without exception small-town boys , or the sons of small farmers . Only a minority were slave owners . Of the South 's white population of five million , only 48,000 were identified as planters , that is , men owning more than twenty slaves . Only 3,000 owned more than a hundred slaves , only 11 more than five hundred , truly staggering wealth in times when a fit , young field hand cost a thousand dollars . The white-pillared mansion , surrounded by shade trees and at a distance from the cabins of the field hands , existed , but more substantially in the imagination of outsiders than in reality . Of the four million slaves in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most owned only one or two and used them to work subsistence farms on which they raised corn-maize , to Europeans-and pigs . Most Southerners were hand-to-mouth farmers who owned no slaves at all . // ( Continues ... ) //
