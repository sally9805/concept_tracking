Oprah is n't the only one attracting people to book clubs . Through parish Bible study groups , Catholics are growing in understanding of scripture , enlivening their faith , and getting closer to God and one another . // Gary Hoffman 's passion for the Bible has caused him to wind up in prison . " When you begin to reflect on scripture , it calls you deeper and deeper , " he says . " I remember several times when we would hold Bible study sessions in our home . They were supposed to go for an hour and a half or two , but then people would start reflecting on how a passage applied to their own spiritual journey , and they 'd really get into it . It would go on and on into the night . " There were several times when this happened , and it would really be getting late , and I 'd say , Look , my wife and I are going to bed . You people are welcome to stay here and continue this discussion , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would stay and keep talking ! That 's part of the enthusiasm that people get when they begin to get into scripture . " Hoffman wound up in prison-if only just visiting-because he and the people with whom he studied the Bible felt called , once they got deeply into the Bible , to action . " You can not study scripture without realizing you are ping called to be more active in your faith , " says Hoffman , a permanent Bacon in suburban Minneapolis who got involved in prison ministry . But how many Catholics can say they really understand scripture and feel comfortable discussing the Bible , say with Protestant friends ? How many Catholics are even attempting to better understand the inspired word of God by taking part in Bible study or scripture reflection groups ? Is becoming more knowledgeable or comfortable with the Bible a priority for Catholics ? Deacon Hoffman 's situation at St. John the Baptist Parish in Excelsior , Minnesota gives an anecdotal answer to questions like these . When Hoffinan began an intensive Bible study program four years ago , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is finishing up the program , the group is down to 12 . This in a parish of nearly 600 families . Californian Leaette Boyles has 40 or 50 people participating in the two Bible study groups she leads in her parish of 4,000 families in suburban Los Angeles . The story is the same at many U.S. Catholic parishes-if they even have Bible study groups . The numbers do n't disappoint Hoffman or Boyles or others involved in Bible study programs in parishes across the country . Fathey Bill Martin felt he had " a pretty good response " when 20 to 30 people " kept coming back " for his first try at a scripture series at his new parish , Guardian Angels in Oakdale , Minnesota . " Would I like to have had a thousand people there ? Sure , " Martin says . " But from the things I learned doing this session , hopefully we 'll have more when we do one this fall . " Scripture.com Many see Catholics and Bible study today the way investors look at a start-up company : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , one of the founders of the Catholic Bible Institute in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles , views Bible study as being in its infancy . " As Catholics we have n't always been exposed to the Bible , but that 's changing , " says Murdy . " I think once people are exposed to the Bible in a pastoral way-as having applications for your life , for your prayer lif  --  they develop their own hunger and thirst for the Bible . " // Steve Mueller says there is a reason Catholic appreciation of the Bible is still limited . " Generally , Catholics were not brought up with scripture , " says Mueller , author of The Seeker 's Guide to Reading the Bible : A Catholic Perspective ( Loyola Press , 1999 ) . " Especially older Catholics were told the Bible really was n't our book . If we wanted to know about spirituality we were told to read the Catholic spiritual writers . " Boyles confirms that attitude . " My mother-in-law 's Bible says right in the beginning , Not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Catholics are breaking out of that tradition , according to Roy Dick , a religious education coordinator at Guardian Angels in Oakdale , Minnesota who runs several Bible study programs there . " A primary thing driving people to come to our Bible programs is that people feel that the Bible got neglected when they were children , " Dick says . " They feel they got shortchanged as Catholics , and that there is a lot of richness in the Bible . They want to capture some of that richness they felt they missed . " What Mueller , Dick , and others feel turned the tide and opened up the world of scripture to Catholics was the Second Vatican Council . Better popular translations of the Bible made it more readable , but Catholics also became exposed to more of scripture at weekend liturgies with the advent of the three-cycle lectionary that came as a fruit of the council 's liturgical reforms . Catholics began hearing more both of the Old and New Testaments at Mass , Mueller says , and preaching became focused on breaking open those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they might apply the biblical lessons to their own lives . Abbot Gregory Polan , O.S.B. , a scripture scholar from Conception Abbey in Missouri , sees that weekly exposure is having its effect on people . " The truth of the situation is that Catholics are becoming more and more aware of the richness of the Bible , " he says . " It 's taking a whole generation for this to take root , but I think in a number of ways we 're moving . " There have been so many indications that before Vatican II Catholics were not encouraged to read the Bible . Today , developing a spirituality of the Bible is an aspect of Catholic life that is just growing and growing and growing . It 's not that uncommon for parishes to have one or more Bible study sessions each week . Yes , there are many Catholics who do n't easily read the Bible . But there are many who do . " Count Delores Frerich among those . The Hereford , Texas mother of five and grandmother of 11 has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nearby Vega , Texas for 10 years now . She knows it has changed her life and the lives of others in the group . " Our group started after we did Renew the Paulist Fathers ' parish renewal program in our parish , " Frerich explained . " We felt like we needed more adult education . We wanted to learn more about our religion . It seems like the church uses the Bible more nowadays , and we felt we could understand more if we knew more about the Bible . " What started as a group of eight has grown to 15 women who meet on Wednesday evenings at 5:15 in the parish hall . They use the Little Rock Scripture Series ( see box on previous page ) and take turns leading the sessions . " Over the years , we kind of have a little bond going that ties us to one another , " French says . " I think it 's brought us closer to God and closer to each other . Before we used to keep things to ourselves . Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while . This involvement with the Bible has helped me turn to God almost ev ery day . " Frerich says she has seen how at least two non-Catholics have been attracted to the church by one of the members of her Bible study group . She has also watched as participation in the Bible study group brought another woman back to church . " 1 think it 's helped our parish a lot , " Frerich says . Now she 's also become involved in teaching religion to young people at Immaculate Conception . " I would n't have done this before I started learning more about the Bible , " French says . " I did n't think I was qualified to teach religion before . Now I feel I have something to offer . " How it 's done Dan Beshara is another Catholic who is sold on the Little Rock Scripture Series . Although developed by his home archdiocese , it has spread across the country to be used by some 7,000 parishes . " I like the focus on a particular book of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a member of St. Bernard Parish in Bella Vista , Arkansas , " and with the booklet you get with each series , you get a commentary to read and discussion questions you can write your own response to in order to prepare for the group session . " While Delores French 's group in Texas uses just the booklet , Beshara 's Bible study group uses the 20-30 minute video lecture that teaches about a particular passage to work in concert with the group discussion of each week 's questions . " The videos are just excellent , " Beshara says . " I always gain new insights . And I find it 's enriching to hear what other people have been prompted to think about after reflecting on scripture . I like the group contact . I like it all ! " With six or eight groups of 10 or 12 people each going all the time , St. Bernard has made Bible study a regular part of its adult faith formation effort , Beshara says . While some see Bible study as in its infancy among Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series has matured nicely to middle age . This year marks the 25th anniversary of the program , and sales of booklets have been averaging about 100,000 for the past five years or so . The Little Rock series also has branched out to open the Bible to a wider audience . Along with Spanish-language versions of its courses , it also has a young adult version and video-based courses that require less reading . " I think it 's the format of the series that makes it successful , " says Lillian Hess , producer of the audiovisual lectures for the Little Rock Scripture Series . " It includes individual study and reading of the Bible . The study guide has questions to reflect upon in prayer and a commentary to help that reflection . " The material is divided up so that there is an assignment each day to encourage daily reading of the Bible and reflection . " Participants meet weekly in groups of eight to 12 or more with a trained leader who facilitates a discussion of responses to the questions from the study guide that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio or video version or one presented by a local speaker-develops and clarifies the theme of the week . Prayer is also a regular part of each week 's session . Lea Boyles is another fan . " I use the Little Rock series when I 'm first starting out with a group , " says Boyles , who leads two groups at St. Margaret Mary Parish in Lomita , California . " They have a very good commentary to study from and a very good program guide for the leader that gives you a structure to follow , which really helps a lot . " The video lecture series is one we often use because the videos are so interesting and so good . They 're kind of entertaining , not so difficult , and yet instructional . The people who are at the beginner 's stage of Bible study are not expecting to do a lot of homework . A lot do n't even have a Bible . " Boyles also recommends the Paulist Fathers ' Share the Word program , which is contained in a handy , easy-to-follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections . " That 's a good , simple Bible study , " she says . " It 's lectionary based , and that 's a real good place to start , because you 're going to hear those readings on Sundays . You read them , discuss them , then you hear that same word proclaimed and broken open by the homilist . " Boyles , however , only feels comfortable in leading her parish Bible study groups , she says , because she has been trained  --  and trained thoroughly-through the Catholic Bible Institute , a three-year program developed in Los Angeles . Boot camp for Bible leaders Kay Murdy and Dorothy King used to go all over the Los Angeles area taking scripture courses . Their hunger to know more eventually led to a partnership between the archdiocesan Office of Religious Education and Loyola-Marymount University to develop a course that met the need for Catholics to delve more deeply into the Bible  --  and to train facilitators to help them do that . The Catholic Bible Institute ( CBI ) , now in its sixth year , trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , September through May . " We had great presenters each month - Bible scholars like Fathers Eugene LaVerdiere , the late Raymond Brown , and Lawrence Boadt , " Murdy says . Participants study , share , and pray in those sessions . Each month they are required to write a paper . The first year 's focus is the Hebrew Testament-more commonly known to Christians as the Old Testament-the second covers the New Testament , and the third year is a practicum in which participants learn how to lead small-group sessions , keep a group on track , and actually plan a Bible study program and have it analyzed by experts . Boyles found CBI invaluable . She went into the classes with the intent to explore and learn about the Bible . She wound up as a leader of Bible study in her parish . " It changed my whole perspective on myself and my relationship with God . Now I 'm also able to bring that knowledge that I gained back to our parishes . I think there should be a Catholic Bible Institute in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a change in me . I 'm not holy or anything , but , well , it 's more like it gives you confidence in your creator and your religion-it gives you that courage of your convictions . " While Los Angeles and its Catholic Bible Institute have added a measure of academic scholarship and created a certificate program for Bible study leaders , the Archdiocese of Denver has raised the ante with an even more strenuous academic program with the Denver Catholic Bible School . Asked by her archbishop to create a solid Bible education program , Franciscan Sister Macrina Scott devised a four-year course . She expected 25-30 people might be interested , according to spokesperson Steve Mueller , who has taught in the program . " In the first year she had over 600 applicants , " Mueller says . " She accepted 160 in the first year , and since 1982 , when the program opened , she has added a teacher every year . This is about the 17th year , and they have 500 people a year going through the course . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other parts of the country , despite its rigorous demands and time commitment . Minnesota Deacon Gary Hoffman tells people that if they take this course and stay with it , it is the equivalent of 24 to 26 college credits over the course of four years . In the Denver program , classes meet each week September through May , three academic quarters of 10 sessions each . " It 's easy enough to put in eight hours of study each week if you 're going to do the reading and the questions and put some thought into it , " Hoffman says . What differentiates the Denver Bible School program from others is that it is very academic . While Hoffman had done scripture reflection in the past , Denver 's is a scripture study course . " It 's so thorough in its approach , " he adds . " People walk away with such a clear understanding . " Getting participants to offer their answers to the study questions was only slightly challenging at first , Hoffman explains . " People were a little apprehensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says folks who just completed the four-year course alongside him this spring often remark that once they better understood the Sunday scripture readings , they began to understand what they were called to do once the Word was broken open by the preacher . That 's an important factor for Hoffman : that the knowledge gained be balanced by a call to action . A regular question each week asks participants in the Denver course to point out which passage in the week 's reading was most important to them - and what this is calling them to do in their life . " We have to constantly be asking that question . " Around the table Religious education coordinator Roy Dick last year ran an introduction to the Bible course with both a morning and an evening group . He also meets one morning a month at Panera Bread , a local bakery/coffee shop , with another small group for a prayer breakfast and Bible study session . " It works out to be mutually beneficial , " Dick says . " We buy their coffee and donuts and they provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has used some of the Little Rock Scripture Series videos for the introduction course , he says he is moved by another resource , Sources of Strength , former President Jimmy Carter 's favorite meditations on the Bible . " It 's a real source of inspiration , " Dick notes . It bothers him , though , that for his parish of 3,000 families so few adults take advantage of the opportunity to enrich their faith lives . " We adults are willing to do anything for our kids for their faith development , but too few of us are willing to do anything for ourselves . " " We are all trying to figure out who our God is and what our relationship with God is . Studying the Bible is an opportunity to enrich the relationship we have to God and with each other . The more we study it , the more we incorporate it into everyday lives . " Dick says his goal is not to get Catholics to be able to quote the Bible the way some fundamentalists do . " That 's all fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather see us try to live out the gospel message around the supper table and with our neighbors and in our workplaces .
