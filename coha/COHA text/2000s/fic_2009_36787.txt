You do n't know me yet , so there is no reason you should care that I 'm stuck on a highway with a blow out . But maybe we can relate to each other . Maybe you can understand that when I say , " Everything goes my way , " I 'm being sarcastic . Not that I'musually dependent on such a primitive form of communication . I 'm actually not very cynical at all . I 'm more of a **40;529;TOOLONG person . Sometimes I even believe that if I dream something , or at least journal it , it will happen . But today , at eight forty-five in the morning , as the sun <br> bakes me like a cod against the blacktop of the Pacific CoastHighway , I 'm feeling a bit sarcastic . <br> It 's February but hotter than normal , which means a long , hot California summer is ahead  --  the kind that seems to bring out the beauty in blondes and the sweat glands in brunettes . I am a brunette . Not at all troubled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I own my brunetteness and always have , even when Sun-In was all the rage . And it ca n't be overstated that chlorine does n't turn my medium chestnut hair green . Actually , it 's the copper , not the chlorine , that turns hair green  --  but that 's a useless trivia fact I try to save for speed dating . <br> I 'm squatting next to my flat tire , examining the small rip . Holding my hair back and offmy neck with one hand , I stand and look up and down the road , hoping to appear mildly distressed . Inside , I 'll admit it , I'mfeeling moderately hysterical.My boss flips out when I 'm late . It would n't matter if my appendix burst , he does n't want to hear excuses . I wish he were the kind of guy who would just turn red in the face and yell , like Clark Kent 's newspaper boss . But no . He likes to lecture as if he 's an intellectual , except he 's weird and redundant and clichT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars zoom by , and I suddenly realize this could be my moment . Part of me says not to be ridiculous , because this kind of thing happens only on shows with a zip code or county name in the title . But still , you ca n't help wondering , hoping , that maybe this is the moment when your life will change.When you meet your soul mate . <br> Like I said , I enjoy my glass/life half full . <br> Even as an optimist , I see no harm in being a little aggressive to achieve my goals . So with my free hand , I do a little wave , throw a little smile , and attempt to lock eyes with people going fifty miles an hour . And then I see him . <br> He 's in a red convertible , the top down , the black sunglasses shiny and tight against his tan skin.He 's wearing pink <br> silk the way only aman with a good , measured amount of confidence can . At least that 's the way I see it from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head turns and he notices me . I do a little wave , flirtatious with a slight hint of unintentional taxi hailing . I decide to smile widely , because he is going fast and I might look blurry . He smiles back.My hand falls to my side . I step back , lean against my car and try to make my conservative business suit seem flattering.There 's nothing I can do about my upper lip sweating except hope my sweatproof department store makeup is holding up its end of the bargain better than my blowout-proof tire did . <br> He seems to be slowing down . <br> Live in the moment , I instruct myself . Do n't think about what I should say or what I could say . Just let it roll , Jessie , let it roll . Do n't over think it . <br> This thought repeats itself when the convertible zooms by . I think he actually accelerated . <br> So . My makeup is failing , along with whatever charm I thought I had . I just ca n't imagine what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have more hits if I were elderly . <br> I do what I have to do.What I know how to do . I change my own stupid tire . Yes , I can , and have been able to since I was eighteen . I can also change my own oil but do n't because then I appear capable of taking care of myself . And I 'm really not . Practically , yes , I can take care of myself . I make decent money . I drive myself home from root canals . I open cans without a can opener . I 'm able to survive for three days in the forest without food or water , and I never lost sleep over Y2K . <br> But I'mt alking about something different . I 'm talking about being taken care of in an emotional way . Maybe it 's a genetic problem . I do n't know . Somehow I became a hopeless romantic . A friend tried the exorcism-equivalent of purging me of this demon when she made me watch TheWar of the Roses two times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls ' night , complete with popcorn and fuzzy slippers . <br> That did n't cure me . <br> I want to be married . I hate being alone . <br> I lift the blown-out tire and throw it in my trunk , slamming it closed.My skin looks like condensation off a plastic cup . I ca n't believe nobody has stopped . Not even a creepy guy . I stand there trying to breathe , trying to get a hold of my anger . I 'm going to be late , I 'm going to be sweaty , and I 'm on the side of a highway alone . <br> " You need some help ? " <br> I whirl around because I realize that I 've just been hoping that even a creepy guy would stop , and since my world works in a way that only my negative thoughts seem to come to pass , you can see why the glass-half-full is so important . <br> The morning sun blinds me and all I see is a silhouette.The voice is deep , kind of mature . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , fully aware that acting cute is not going to undo the sweat rings that have actually burst through three layers of fabric , so I do n't bother . I dramatically gesture tomy car and try a smile . " But as you can see , I do n't now . " <br> " You 're sure ? " <br> " Yes . But thank you very much , " I say , for stopping after I 'm completely finished . I trudge back to my car and start the air conditioner . Glancing back in my rearview mirror , I study the silhouette . He sort of has the same shape as the guy in my dream last night . My night- mare . It was actually a dream after my nightmare , where you feel awake but you 're not . It was n't the nocturnal version of Chainsaw Massacre , but it did involve taffeta . <br> He does n't wave . He does n't move . He just stands there , exactly like the guy in my dream . It 's very dTja vu  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my blinker on , pull onto the highway , and leave him behind , driving below the speed limit on my flimsy spare tire all the way to work . <br> I work at Coston Real Estate.We 're squeezed between a wireless store and a Pizza Hut.We stand out a little because of our two huge dark wood doors , ten feet tall and adorned with silver handles . I push open one of the doors and walk in.Mine is the front desk . It 's tall , almost BerlinWall-like . People have to peer over it to see me , <br> and I look very small on the other side.When I'msitting , I can barely see over the top of it . <br> I walk toward the break room , past nine square cubicles , all tan and otherwise colorless . Even the carpet is tan.On my left are the real offices with walls . <br> Nicole , inside her cubicle , sees me . " What happened to you ? " <br> We 've been good friends ever since I started working here , ten years ago . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has that kind of expression I wish I could wear . Her eyebrows slant upward toward each other , like a bridge that 's opening to let a boat through . It 's part " you 're weird " and part " I 'm worried . " She has sass and I love it . She 's working her way up to senior agent and is one of Mr. Coston 's favorites , but I do n't hold that against her . <br> I do n't answer because I 'm busy staring at her new eight-by-ten framed family picture . It 's very Picture People : white background , casual body language , all four wearing identical polos and jeans . I love that kind of husband , who will wear matching clothes with his family . They 're so adorable . <br> " Jessie , seriously girl , you okay ? You 've got black smeared across your forehead . " <br> I tear my eyes away from the photo . " Blow out on the highway . " <br> The eyebrow bridge is lowered , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own tire . " <br> I put my forehead against the edge of her cube wall . " I did . " <br> " Oh.Wow . I wish I knew how to change a tire . " <br> " No , you do n't . Trust me . " <br> She reaches under her desk and pulls out a neatly wrapped gift . " For you . " <br> I smile . I love gifts . I drop my things and tear it open even though I already know what it is . " Nicole , it 's beautiful ! " It 's a leather bound journal with gold , embossed lettering and heavy , lined paper inside . " What 's the occasion ? " <br> " It 's February . I know how much this monthWell , it tends to be a long month for you , that 's all . " She points to the spine of it . " It sort of reminds me of the one I brought you back from Italy four years ago . Remember ? " <br> " Yes , it does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month bring you  --  " <br> " Love . " From my bag , I pull out a folder and slap it on her desk . <br> " What is this ? " She says it like a mom who has just been handed a disappointing report card . <br> " Just look . " <br> Carefully , like something might jump out and insult her , she opens the folder . She picks up three glossy photos of several potential loves of my life . <br> " They 're hot , are n't they ? " I ask . <br> " Too hot , " she says . <br> " There 's no such thing as too hot . " <br> " Suspiciously too hot , like an air brush might be involved . " <br> I grab the photos from her and turn them around for her to see . With my finger , I underline each of their names : CuteBootsieBoo , SuaveOneYouWant , OneOfAKindMan . <br> " Jessie CuteBootsieBoo.Mmm . Does n't have a good ring to it . " <br> " It 's their instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that makes it better ? " <br> I sigh . " You have got to get into the twenty-first century , you know . This is the best way to meet a guy . " <br> " You can tell a lot about a man by what he names himself . " She looks up at me and shakes her head . " Seriously . You set up a date with one of these and they 'll show up with a beer gut , a walker , or a rap sheet . " <br> " None of them rap . " <br> Nicole stands , grabs my arm with one hand and my stuff with the other , and whisks me to my desk . She nearly pushes me into my chair and drops everything in front of me . <br> " Chill out , " I say as she walks away . " This service guarantees background checks . But if you happen to end up needing a restraining order , they 'll pay for it . " <br> Nicole gasps and whirls around . <br> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lean back in my chair , looking at the ceiling as my hands feel the leather on my new journal . " This 'll be the year , Nicole . " <br> " You say that every year . Especially in February , which is why I got you the  --  " <br> I snap forward . " But I 've never taken control like this before . Three online match sites , one dating service.They find what you want or your money back . " <br> Nicole walks back towardme and leans over the counter . " I did n't realize QVC sold dates . If you order in the next ten minutes , do you get two for the price of one , plus an eight-pieceTupperware set ? " She reaches for my chocolate bowl . <br> I scowl at her , but lift the bowl up so she can reach it . " What do you know about it ? You got married right out of college . " <br> " Do n't remind me . " She carefully unwraps her candy and takes a mini-bite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grab a piece of dark chocolate out of my candy bowl and get the whole thing in my mouth before she takes another bite . <br> Nicole shrugs and leans against the counter . " Sometimes you just got ta leave these things up to fate . " She goes back to nibbling on her chocolate . <br> I swirl my hands in the air . " Fate , God , the universe . They 've all been asleep on the job of setting up a love story for me . " I stand up . " No . I am going to make this happen myself . " <br> Nicole does n't look up from her candy . " Do you even know what it means to be married ? To be chained to another person for the rest of your life ? To pick up socks and wash underwear and care for a grown man like he 's just popped out of infancy ? Huh ? " <br> I glare at her even though she 's got eyes only for her candy . " It 's got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven times . " <br> She bites her lip , and finally glances at me . " But you know howyou kind of need everything to be a certain way . " <br> I nudge my stapler so it is n't perfectly perpendicular to my sticky notes , just to show her I'mable to handle disorder . I try not to stare at it because now it 's really bugging me . " Are you saying I 'm a control freak ? " <br> " With OCD tendencies . You ca n't expect everything to be exactly how you want it if you want to live through a marriage . " I stand and start walking slowly toward the back bathroom . " I know what compromise means . " <br> Nicole follows . " Then why do you get mad when I have to check with my husband before we go out ? That 's what marriage is . You ca n't even poop without someone else knowing . " <br> I glance at her to see if she 's serious . She is . Part of me wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her about my dreams . But she 's really pooping on my parade today.We get to her desk and she sits down . I walk on . <br> I have these dreams . I 'm talking nocturnal , not journal . Yeah , I dream in my journal . I admit it . I 've written in one since I was fourteen , when I found a strange delight every time I drew a heart with a boy 's name attached in squiggly letters . <br> But back to my nightmare . It started with me in a wedding dress . That 's not the nightmare.That part was actually cool because I was in a dress I designed in my journal when I was twenty-two . The wedding march was playing . I love the wedding march . Nothing can replace it . I cringe every time I hear a country song or bagpipes or something.My wedding , it 's got to be traditional . <br> I was making my way down the aisle , rhythmically elegant , one foot in front of the other . My shoulders were thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my waist . I once saw a bride carry her bouquet all the way down the aisle holding it at her chest . I shudder just talking about it . <br> The train fluttered behind me , like it 's weightless ormaybe there 's an ocean breeze not too far away . It was long , bright white , and caused people to nod their approval . <br> I smiled . <br> Then the weddingmarch stopped , halting like a scratched record . I looked up to find another bride in my place , wearing my dress , standing next to my guy . I could n't see what he looked like ; he was facing the pastor . But the bride , she looked back at me with menacing eyes , overdone with teal eye shadow and fake lashes . <br> I screamed . I could n't help it . I closedmy eyes and screamed again . <br> When I opened them , I could hardly believe what I was looking at . A church full of people , looking at her . And what was I doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gasping , I looked down . Hot pink ! With dyed-to-match shoes ! I glanced next to me and covered my mouth . It was me again , standing next to me , in green . Dyed footwear . <br> And there I was again , standing next to my lime self , this time in canary yellow . On and on it goes . I counted ten of me before I woke up , gasping for air , clutching myself to make sure I was wearing cotton pajamas . <br> " Thank God , " I said , but as I looked up , I saw a man in my room . <br> He was backlit against my window , like the moon was shining in on him , but I do n't think the moon was out . A scream started forming in my throat , but I recognized that he was not in a stance that indicated he was going to stab me to death.There was no knife.Nothing but an easy , casual lean against my window sill . Truly , no less scary . <br> The scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the string three or four times before it turned on , but when it did , the man was gone . <br> I realize I am standing in the middle of the hallway near Nicole 's desk . She is gabbing on the phone , but looking at me funny . I go to the coat closet next to the bathroom . I always , always keep a spare change of clothes at work , just in case I have to do something like change my tire . Or someone else 's . It 's happened . <br> I take out my least favorite suit , which is why I keep it here . It 's lilac with a boxy neckline that makes me feel like I should be a nanny . I head toward the bathroom . <br> " Stone , get me the ad copy for the new Hope Ranch listings . " <br> This is my boss , Mr. Coston , dragging me back to reality.He pops his head out the door as I pass by but yells at me like I 'm down the hall . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " Already on your desk , sir , " I say . <br> He 's in his sixties , with a loud but raspy voice and shiny silver hair that tops a permanent look of disappointment . " What happened to you ? " <br> " Blown tire . " I hold up my suit . " I was just going to change . " <br> " Fine . Then get me a latte . Lighten up on the sugar , will you ? " <br> " Right , " I mumble as he disappears . " Lighten up on life , will you ? " <br> I 'm the office equivalent of a bat boy . I 'm the coffee girl . It 's this one thing that sort of drives me crazy about my job . I do a lot of important things , but when I have to run get coffee , I feel like I 'm falling down the rungs of the occupational ladder . It makes me wonder . If I had a job I could get passionate about , would I be so desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work rather than my dreams . <br> Well , either way , I 'm drowning , and that 's never good . <br> After I change and decide I really , really dislike the color lilac , I grab my purse and head for the neighborhood Starbucks . It 's five blocks away and I like that . It gives me time to walk and think on such things as to why Mr. Coston has been married for thirty-four years , the exact number of years I have n't been married.He does n't mention his wife much and does n't even have a picture of her in his office . He does n't wear a wedding band and when he does take a vacation , it 's with his buddies to golf resorts . <br> It just seems like the world could better balance itself out , that 's all . <br> I 'm nearly to Starbucks . People are leaving with their white and green cups of bliss . The putrid smell of coffee will soon replace the putrid smell of old rainwater evaporating underneath the sun . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feeling everyone wants by drinking coffee I have naturally , just like my chestnut hair . <br> I 'm about to open the door , and then I see him , in all his glory . <br> Continues ...
