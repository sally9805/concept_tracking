Fatal Error By Colleen Thompson Dorchester Publishing Colleen Thompson When Susan took her seat at one of the barbecue joint 's tables , the rancher parents of one of her ex-students stood up and walked out of the place . But not before the graying redhead who had been one of her high school 's most fervent volunteers shot her a world-class go-to-hell look . And not before the pain of it had the chance to seep into Susan 's soul . She ought to be used to it by now : the dark looks and the whispers , the speculation about whether she was getting away with murder . Somehow , though , it never ceased to shock her ; it never ceased to hurt . As the Harrises ' pick-up left the parking lot , Susan made out a dust devil working its way across the arid valley . When the smoky plume resolved itself into a motorcycle , her breath caught in her throat . Let him help me out of family loyalty or guilt over his brother 's bad behavior or , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long to forget . Just let him say he 'll do it . Not the most orthodox of prayers , she knew , but maybe she 'd earn points for desperation . She had a perfect right to worry , because after an hour-long bounce from Clementine across a ranch road that saw more lizards , tumbleweeds , and roadrunners than car traffic , Luke was bound to be long on sweat and short on temper . Worse yet , he wasa Maddox , the last person she should trust . " You take that box and turn it in to the ... " Her mom had leaned on her walker , searching her mind for the elusive word . Frustration glittered in her brown eyes before she wrestled the damaged speech center of her brain into obedience . " To the sheriff , like you ought to . You give it to one of them Maddoxes , he 'll just make - just make you more trouble . Or have n't you learned yet ? " Susan had learned , all right . A person learned a hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the local banker 's wife , a fortune in false loans , and God knows how much stolen from the family business . But the toughest lessons in the world could n't keep her from concluding that her husband 's brother was her and her mother 's only chance . Even if he 'd be furious once he learned she 'd lied to get him to drive out to a third-rate barbeque joint at the intersection of the ranch road that connected Clementine , the county seat , with busy Highway 90 . Susan might be in a foul mood herself - she 'd spent most of the eight months since Brian vanished mad as hell - but she was n't stupid . If ever there was a time to play nice , this was it . Despite her resolution , when all six-feet , four inches of Luke blew through the front door , his expression did nothing to ease the tension knotted in her stomach . With his helmet tucked beneath his arm and his dark hair damp with sweat , he strode directly toward her , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from his jeans with every step . After pulling off his sunglasses , he glared down at her , clearly not fooled by her red lipstick or the wide-brimmed hat that hid her shoulder-length brown hair . But then , even seated , Susan could n't hide her athletic , six-foot frame . " That 's your red Jeep parked outside , right ? The one you called about ? " His tone warned he already knew the answer . " Tires look fine to me . " Luke sat down , drained half the glass of tea the waitress had poured , then said , " Now tell me why you lied to get me here . It 's sure as hell not for the service . " " I picked this place because it 's private , " she explained . " No one from Clementine ever darkens the door . " No one except the Harrises , anyway . But at least they had n't seen her here with Luke . " Why all the secrecy ? " he asked . " Surely , you are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brittle . " Maybe not yours , " she lied , realizing she was stalling . " But mine scares me half to death . " Her mother was so adamant on the subject , Susan had had to say that she was going to the sheriff . She could n't recall the last day she had played so fast and loose with truth . " How is Maggie ? " Luke asked . Real interest softened his expression , and she could n't help feeling grateful . Since Brian 's disappearance , Susan had almost forgotten what it felt like to see eyes that did n't teem with unvoiced questions . Could you have done it ? Did you ? Friends and neighbors , co-workers and parents of her students might look directly at her , but Susan knew they were seeing her picture in the paper . Right next to the missing Jessica Beecher , Brian , and the photo of her husband 's burned-out car still smoldering in a remote arroyo in the desert . She still could n't believe the jerk had been heartless enough to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better , " she told Luke . " The therapy 's made a big difference , with her speech especially . But she 's still weak on her right side , and mentally - well , let 's just say I ca n't see her living on her own . " " So you two are roommates now ? " " Yeah , can you believe it ? After all the grief I gave her raising me , now I get to be the responsible party . But it 's been good for me , having someone to look after . It takes my mind off everything . Well , " she said with a shrug , " that 's a lie , but it does give me someone to pretend for . " A span of silence stretched between them as she searched his gaze . No suspicion there , thank God , only troubled comprehension . Luke 's voice jarred Susan out of the unpleasant thoughts . " Let 's get to the point . Why 'd you really bring me all the way out here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth out past it . A truth she 'd been keeping from her mother for a week . " The superintendent called me . He said - he said the board 's decided to terminate my teaching contract . " The panic that had been building burst out in an unstoppable torrent . " I ca n't let them do this . If I ca n't teach this fall , I 'll have to leave town to look for work and pack my mom off to my sister 's . And you know Carol . She 'll park Mom in some California nursing home the minute she gets inconvenient . And God , Luke , that would kill her . Mom 's lived around Clementine her whole life . Her friends are here , and all her memories . I 'm not about to let those bast- " " Hold on . Let 's back up a minute , " Luke said . " Why would they fire you ? " " He says parents have been calling , saying they do n't trust me with their kids . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . ' " Her laughter made a harsh sound . " It 's funny . The last time Dr. Winthrop called , it was to tell me I 'd been named the district 's teacher of the year . Spineless little weasel . " " What I do n't get is why would anyone complain ? " Luke said . " Brian 's alive - hell , two witnesses saw him and Jessica Beecher at that New Mexico gas station a couple of days after the sheriff found his car . And did n't Jessica leave some kind of message on her answering machine ? " " A story that was buried on page seven . But I do n't think it would matter anyway . It was that first article that did it . " Her throat ached with the anger she had swallowed back . " No one 's forgotten those pictures - especially the ones of the deputies hauling evidence out of my house . And I 'm sure they 've all been talking about what that ass Ramirez said . " Every word of the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maddox claims she was hiking out around the national park the day her husband disappeared , but so far , we 've found no witnesses to verify her story . " Her story , as if she 'd made up the whole thing - and if her photos , stamped with the date , were n't evidence enough , what would be ? She decided on the spot she 'd make room for Manuel Ramirez 's picture next to Brian 's on her dartboard . " But the sheriff cleared you the next day , " Luke argued . " He said neither you nor Hal Beecher was a suspect . " Their conversation stopped as the waitress brought them their food . Luke stood , and for one heart-stopping moment , Susan was certain he was walking out the door . Instead , he snagged a ketchup bottle from another table and came back to hand it to her . " Here you go , " he said , his fingers brushing hers as he withdrew them . " I think we 've seen the last of our waitress for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too stunned by the impulse that had nearly driven her to grasp his hand and hold it . If she 'd been quick and bold enough , would he have held hers back ? What was happening to her ? He 'd barely swept his fingers past hers , and worse yet , he was Brian 's brother . Not the boy she 'd known back in high school , the troublemaker whose reputation for tinkering under the hoods of fast cars and faster girls had scared her into refusing him each time he 'd asked her out . Until that one time , when he 'd talked her into sneaking out for that ride in his convertible at night . The night the yucca blossoms had perfumed a star-drunk sky ... the night she 'd been fool enough to let him charm her out of her virginity . The next day , she 'd been grounded for two weeks after Carol squealed that she 'd seen the two of them by Susan 's locker " leaning way too close . " If Carol had known the whole of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even as it was , by the time she 'd managed to escape her mother and sister 's scrutiny , Luke had gone on to bigger and better B-cups - as if their time together had n't meant a thing to him . Certainly , neither of them had brought up the incident again . " So what do you need ? " Luke was asking . " A good lawyer ? Seems to me you could sue the hell out of Dr. Winthrop and the whole damned school board for that matter . They ca n't just fire a good teacher because a few hysterical parents complain . " Her trembling hand found its way inside her purse and pulled out a box about the size of a standard paperback . This was what she 'd come for , the long shot she was betting could save her . As she passed it to Luke , tightness gripped her chest , and perspiration boiled to the surface . Swallowing back her emotions , she tugged at the creeping hemline of her denim skirt , then crossed her bare legs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found this , " Susan told him . " And I 'm hoping - praying , really - that it might hold some answers . " Luke took it from her and glanced down at the packaging . " A hard drive ? Brian 's ? " At her nod , he added , " I thought the sheriff 's department confiscated his computer . " " They did n't get this part . " He raised his brows , an unmistakable invitation to explain . " Our hard drive went belly-up about two weeks before Brian disappeared . He was really upset about it , said he had a bunch of tax stuff stored there he did n't want to spend the next three months inputting . " Luke muttered , " I told him he needed a good backup routine . Some people never learn their lesson . " " Brian and half the computing world . " Including her , thought Susan , though she certainly knew better . " I should n't gripe . It 's the same half that keeps a lot of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed right away , " said Susan , " so he drove the computer all the way to an electronics superstore in El Paso . The guy ended up selling him a new drive . Said he could n't fix the old one . " " Typical superstore geek move , " Luke said . " Installing a new hard drive 's a lot simpler than trying to restore lost information - if the guy knew how . Real data recovery specialists charge thousands , and they do n't guarantee a thing . " " Afterwards , " she said , " he gave Brian the box with the warranty information inside . I was packing away some of Brian 's stuff when it fell off the top shelf of his closet . I picked it up and noticed the old drive was in there too . Then I got to thinking , maybe there 's a chance that someone with your background could fix it , find a way into Brian 's e-mail and financial records - " Luke laid the box back on the table , outside the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slide it back to her . " The state has experts trained to do that . You do n't want me touching this . " " Why not ? " The pitch of her voice climbed with her rising panic . " I know you 're really good , with all those industry awards . You 've been in high tech almost all your li - " " Exactly , " Luke said . " And I 'm Brian 's brother . Assuming I could get anything out of this old hard drive - and that 's a huge assumption - the information would be tainted . Do you know how easy it would be for someone like me to falsify computer files ? " " But you would n't . And what would it matter anyway , if something in those files helped me track down Brian ? " He shook his head . " I want Brian back here just as much as you do . I want to hear from him what the hell he was thinking , and then I want to see the bastard pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can - " " No . I do n't want him paying with some chickenshit family scolding that 'll end up with my mom selling off the ranch to bail him out . I do n't even want him paying with a good ass-kicking , which I would happily dispense . Brian needs to go to jail for what he 's done . He 's screwed up a lot of lives , and for once , he 's going to have to face the music . " Resentment burned in Luke 's expression , and Susan could guess the reason . How many times had she heard Virginia Maddox dismiss his job as " monkeying around with those fool contraptions " or call him " a tumbleweed , hardly better than oilfield trash " for his frequent job changes within the volatile technology sector ? From personal experience , Susan knew that Brian had the market cornered on the rare commodity of that old bat 's approval , but how much worse would it have been had Virginia Maddox been her mother ? Hot as the day was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to take this to the sheriff , " Luke said . " I ca n't understand why you did n't in the first place . " " The man 's been in office since Sam Houston was in grade school , " she erupted . " It would take me hours to explain to Hector Abbott exactly what a hard drive is . Luke , you have to help me , please . There 's is n't time to play this game by their rules anymore . I 'm already going to lose the house - Beecher has no choice but to foreclose - but once my paycheck 's gone , I wo n't even be able to keep up the rent on Mom 's apartment . " Luke did n't touch the box . " Take it in to Hector . This is his investigation , not ours . But if you need some money - " This time , she was the one who stood and stared him down . " I do n't need your damned money . Luke Maddox , I need you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
