When I was seven , my father killed himself . He woke upone morning in 1977 and swallowed a bottle of Valium thatmy mother 's doctor , ironically , had prescribed to help hercope with with the stress of my father 's depression . Well , theValium helped with the stress , all right . You could almostsay those pills solved the whole problem . No one had told my mother that the pills could be fatal ( although someone , obviously , had told my father ) , and asa result she has n't trusted doctors since . So it was a fewmonths after she started losing her memory before she relentedand made an appointment with Dr. Snyder on ParkAvenue . It 's nothing , Dr. Snyder assured her . You 're notyoung anymore , and this is what we expect to see at yourage , a little memory loss . Everyone takes it hard . She tried not to take it hard . Two months later she camehome from work to 105 East Twelfth Street and her house keywould n't work . She tried another key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her ring , twice , that she rememberedshe had n't lived on Twelfth Street since 1977 . She went backup to Dr. Snyder on Park Avenue . Now , Dr. Snyder said , we 'll run some tests . It 's normal , it 's natural , it 's just a smidgenmore than we expect to see at this age , it 's progressinga little more rapidly than we would like and so we 'll runsome tests , we 'll run some very expensive tests and we 'll see . Evelyn , my mother , mentioned the visits to Dr. Snyderoffhandedly during one of our monthly phone calls , as regularas the full moon . I did n't know what to say so I asked , lamely , why she did n't tell me earlier . " I did n't want you to worry , " she said . " They said maybeit 's my circulation , so I 'm taking some pills . Herbs . Thatshould help . It 's probably nothing , I justwell , I thought Ishould tell you . I thought you should know what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nothing . If it was nothing she wouldn'thave told me about it . I asked if there was anything I coulddo . " Actually , " she said , " there is something I 'd like you do . " The slight Brooklyn accent my mother had when I was a girlhas , without my father 's WASPy Connecticut influence , thickened a little every year since he died . Now she speaksfrom her throat with drawn-out vowels and hard ts and youwould never know , listening to her , that she moved to Manhattanin 1961 . She said : " We 're having the holiday party atwork in a few weeks and I 'd like you to come . Just in casewell , you know . In case I need some help . " No , this is not nothing . Dr. Snyder said , we 'll see . Now my mother tries to get adead person on the phone once a week and has twice moretried to go home to Twelfth Street and we have n't seen anything.Thousands of dollars worth of blood tests and neurologicalexams and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of possibilities : we saw vitamin deficiencies ; Alzheimer 's ; psychiatric disorders ; alcohol abuse ; drug abuse ; blood-sugar conditions ; brain tumors ; head injury ; encephalitis.Now almost every diagnosis Dr. Snyder and his team canthink of has been eliminated , and we see nothing at all .
