Nobody 's perfect . So , a lot of the people on the beach are skinnier than you . Big deal . There 's always somebody older and fatter out there , too , so you might as well wear your bathing suit and enjoy yourself . <p>  --  MY BEST FRIEND , LINDA MURRAY <p> LIKE MOST PEOPLE , I 've always thought of the word perfect as an absolute , but there 's nothing like a wedding to prove otherwise , especially when the wedding 's your daughter 's and you know it 's a big mistake . Then the term is relative  --  like disaster . <p> All her life , my second-born , Callie , had been a mother 's dream : smart as her physicist father , outgoing as her big brother Jack , principled and salt-of-the-earth sensible as my precious mother-in-law , and gorgeously athletic as my mother  --  who is still a handsome woman at eighty-four and walks three miles a day , and drives like a New York cabbie in Atlanta traffic . <p> Callie was our perfect daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry . <p> But the word perfect can also mean " completed . " Little did I know that my obedient daughter was saving up all her bad-behavior credits to cash them in on one giant bombshell of a boo-boo that would redefine " perfect wedding " in biblical terms , meaning finished , **32;1346;TOOLONG . <p> Oh , for a crystal ball ! If I could have been absolutely sure my instincts were right , I would have gunnysacked her to keep her from the altar . As it was , I was the one who got gunnysacked . <p> The present . Second Tuesday in January . 10:55 A.M. Muscogee Drive , Atlanta . <p> NORMALLY I LOVE January 's sweet , silent stillness after the glittering clutter and excitement of Christmas . Stripped of wretched excess ( the only way to decorate for the holidays ) , my house seems clean and sleek and tranquil . I bask in the new year 's quiet order with a long , relaxing breath and look forward to the high spot in my monthly routine , lunch with my lifelong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since we were pledges in our high school sorority , Linda , Diane , Teeny , and I ( and lately Pru , our prodigal ) have tended the ties that bind on the second Tuesday of every month at the Swan Coach House Restaurant , where we share laughter , fun , fellowship , frozen fruit salad , and generous doses of " Poor Baby " on a scale of one to five ( the only allowable response to whining of any kind ) . <p> When we all started turning fifty , we decided to wear red hats and purple in honor of Jenny Joseph 's wonderful poem " Warning , " a delightful declaration of in de pen dence for midlife and beyond . Governed only by our own Twelve Sacred Traditions of Friendship , our luncheons have become a welcome refuge of ac cep tance and sanity  --  or occasional insanity , none of which was ever my idea  --  in this crazy world . And every month , we take turns bringing a joke that 's not woman-bashing , and preferably not man-bashing , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten to the Swan Coach House Restaurant early so I could sip my iced tea or hot lemonade in our regular banquette in the back corner of the main dining room and savor the anticipation of seeing my friends . <p> Until that gray morning last January , when  --  for the first time ever  --  I was seriously considering skipping the whole thing . Disconnecting the phone , turning off my cell , taking one of the four sleeping pills I had left from a trip to En gland five years ago , and pulling the covers up over my head . <p> Not that it would do any good to postpone the inevitable , but I could n't stand the idea of telling anybody , even my best friends , about the dumb thing my brilliant daughter was about to do . Not until I absolutely had to . <p> If I stayed home and took the sleeping pill , it would knock out my internal Chicken Little along with me . She 'd been dithering away in hyper-drive ever since Callie 's New Year 's Day announcement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to my psyche , I have this constant internal dialogue with pieces of myself that just wo n't shut up . Chicken Little , my drama queen , and my scolding Inner Puritan hog up the whole house , relegating my Sensible Self and Creative Inner Child to the shed out back . <p> It occurs to me that some people might think it odd , especially when I argue with myself aloud , but it works for me . I mean , it 's not like I believe I 'm hearing voices . I know it 's all me . I talk to machines , too  --  all the time  --  but that 's not crazy . It 's only crazy when you think they talk back . Unless they really do , which happens more and more often these days . <p> Nevertheless , on that second Tuesday morning last January , my Sensible Self managed to push her way into the parlor and urged me  --  for the fiftieth time since Callie 's announcement  --  to look at the big picture and remember how blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive . Callie had finished her doctorate in theoretical mathematics and landed a job teaching at Oglethorpe in the fall . Our twenty-nine-year-old son Jack was happily building Home Depots all over America . My husband John and I had a fabulous love affair going that had waited till midlife to burst into flame . John had tenure teaching physics at Georgia Tech . We had finally paid off the mortgage . God was in His heaven . And I had four steadfast friends to help get me through this . <p> Maybe I ought to go to the luncheon after all . <p> As usual , Chicken Little ignored all the blessings , only to squawk , Callie 's making the mistake of her life ! She has no idea what she 's getting into ! Linda and Teeny and Pru will know the minute they slap eyes on you that something 's seriously wrong . <p> All I 've ever wanted to do was keep a low profile , but no such luck . It 's a curse , having a face that hides nothing . <p> I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacred Tradition of Friendship Number Five ) . But then my loyal friends would probably worry up all kinds of drastic things . <p> If I simply played hooky , they 'd send out the bloodhounds . But if I called to cancel , they 'd expect an explanation . When it came to our monthly friendship fix , the only acceptable excuses were foreign travel , jury duty , chemo , moving away , or hospitalization . <p> Standing at the mirror in the foyer of my little house on Muscogee Drive , I reapplied my nonfeathering red lipstick for the third time and prayed with as much conviction as I could muster for the grace to accept Callie 's choice . But God and I both knew my heart was n't really in it . So I ended up reminding Him yet again that this whole thing could n't be a good idea . <p> The Lord and I have that kind of a relationship . I speak my mind , and He loves me anyway and runs the Universe as He sees fit , whether I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Linda 's daughter Abby had quit Agnes Scott six months short of graduating with honors to become a hairdresser and move in with ( and later marry ) her Jewish mother 's nightmare : a lapsed-Moslem Rastafarian tattoo artist whose student visa had expired . <p> Which meant that Linda would certainly be able to empathize , but that offered cold comfort . Nobody really wants to hear , " It could be worse . " <p> I sighed in resignation . As the Beatles said , " Oh-blah-dee , oh-blah-dah , life goes on , " so I decided to suck it up and go to my luncheon . <p> I picked up my red felt picture hat . Maybe just this once , I could keep from blabbing everything . <p> Other people 's secrets , I could keep , but not my own . Still , just because I had n't ever been able to do it before did n't mean I could n't do it now . There 's a first time for everything . <p> Grabbing my red pocketbook , I resolved to develop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this .
