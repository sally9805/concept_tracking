AIDS was the last thing Gui Xien expected to find in the remote peasant villages of China 's Henan province . But when he visited there in 1999 , as a favor to a fellow doctor whose patients were dying from a mysterious disease , it did n't take Gui long to make a diagnosis . The stories were all the same : first the husband would fall ill , then his wife , and after a few months , both would be dead , covered in sores and dark , wine-colored blotches . Gui had stumbled on a full-fledged AIDS epidemic , something he had only read about in medical journals . While in school , he says quietly , " I had no interest to study AIDS because I thought AIDS can not become a serious medical problem in China . I was wrong . " <P> Gui , 68 , an infectious-disease specialist at Wuhan University , immediately informed provincial health authorities that AIDS had somehow broken out of the usual high-risk groups  --  homosexual men , intravenous-drug users and commercial-sex workers  --  and infiltrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had this " foreigner 's disease " come to infect poor rice farmers who scrape by on 2,000 yuan ( $250 ) a year and rarely leave their village ? <P> The answer , when Gui hit on it , turned out to be a political hot potato . In the 1980s , the Chinese government launched a drive to replenish dwindling blood-bank supplies and paid donors for their plasma . For the impoverished farmers , it was an easy way to supplement their income . " When I asked if they donated blood , many said yes , many , many times  --  30 , 40 , sometimes 100 to 200 times , " Gui recalls . Tragically , the needles used  --  some in the hands of entrepreneurial middlemen known locally as " blood heads "  --  were not always sterile . All it would need for the virus to take hold was one HIV-positive donor . <P> Gui took 11 samples from the villagers , but could afford to test only six of them , with 1,600 yuan ( $200 ) out of his own pocket . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to expose an outbreak that originated in a government-sponsored program , were slow to respond and refused to allow Gui to return to the villages . So he and three students sneaked back in during a long weekend holiday when he knew the gatekeepers might be off duty . For three days he went house to house , collecting samples , counseling patients and explaining how the virus is spread . <P> This time Gui sent his report directly to Beijing , where it was treated with the seriousness it deserved . Henan officials were finally pressured into action , but this only made Gui more unpopular in the province , and he became the target of smear campaigns and physical threats . <P> With the central government now involved , local authorities could no longer hide what the world has come to know as China 's AIDS villages . Today a health clinic in the first village Gui visited provides free HIV testing and antiretroviral treatments , and a charity home shelters orphans and the elderly whose caretakers have died of AIDS . <P> For Gui , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says of the people he continues to look after . A modest man , he is far more comfortable talking about the villagers than discussing his role in revealing the epidemic . His most treasured possession is a metal plaque from the farmers that reads , TO GUI : A ROLE MODEL FOR HELPING PEOPLE .
