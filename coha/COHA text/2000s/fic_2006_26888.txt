Chapter One One Heart , One Soul " Right then , first sequence , salida , and then eight steps forward . Ready ? " " Yes , Grgoire . " " Off we go , then . " The guitar echoed in the old pelota court , now a ballroom . Its walls were carved with grotesque figures . Roberta Morgenstern clung to her partner . One arm outstretched , his aquiline profile on view , he had all the majesty of a conquistador pointing to the Promised Land . The drum signalled the start of the dance . The violin and bandoneon came in , and the couple set off along the invisible diagonal of the tango . The music , slow at first , accelerated , snapping like a whiplash above their heads . Roberta had danced the first sequence in a kind of daze . She was abruptly brought back to earth by the pause before the next movement and the half-turn into which her dancing master was guiding her as they started off the other way . " Not so airy-fairy , Roberta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or city outskirts , knife fights , brothels and milonga dances , the wooden paving of the streets of Buenos Aires . . . Roberta abandoned herself to the strong pulse of the tango . Grgoire Rosemonde sensed that they were achieving perfect unison . His partner was wild , fizzing with energy , just the way he liked her -- carnivorous , incisive , very much the Amazon ! The secondsequence finished . They faced each other , Roberta with a hint of challenge in her eyes , Rosemonde with the glinting glance that always disconcerted her . " What is it ? " she asked , retreating . He took hold of her firmly again and held her close to his chest . She was a head shorter , but her air of determination made up for their difference in height . The colour of their eyes -- hers emerald green , his aquamarine -- suggested that they had been made from the same block of malachite . A subtle alchemical process took place between them when they looked at each other like that . " You 're wonderful , my dear . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to remember the old saying Cor unum et anima una , one heart and one soul , and observe it to the letter . " She was happy with the one heart bit , but was it safe to entrust her soul to him ? " Show me what you feel deep down ! " he added imperiously . The pair of them set off again in a staccato sequence , while the music of violin , flute , bandoneon , and drum made the rafters , the chandeliers and the floor itself vibrate . The Community Building was the tallest of all the ministerial office blocks . From its basement , which housed the Records Office and the tracer-manufacturing production plant , all the way to the Minister of Security 's office at the very top , it stood for the vigilance and justice of the legal system that governed Basle . Major Gruber presided over the Criminal Investigation Department on the sixty-ninth floor . And just what crimes did they investigate ? he wondered . The crime rate had been in free fall for almost thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , not since that business of the Killers ' Quadrille . " Thanks to those wonderful tracers of ours , " muttered the Major without any enthusiasm whatsoever . The tracers were everywhere , by day and by night . Vigilant little dust-motes carried on the wind , they stored the genetic codes of the people of Basle in their memories and raised the alarm when any crime , however minor , was committed . The culprits were identified on the spot and arrested by the militia . Crime had as good as died out . Year by year the CID had been shedding inquiry agents . Gruber kept about thirty reservists on call , including Roberta Morgenstern and young Clment Martineau , who seemed set for a fine career in Security , although he was a little too intrepid and high-spirited for the Major . Major Gruber liked the moderate , thoughtful approach -- though he himself had been young at a time when there were no tracers . Gruber slipped a hand into the middle drawer of his desk , worked the mechanism of its false bottom , and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sheltered from the light of day . Three objects wrapped in jewel-coloured velvet lay there . He set them out in front of him . The gold dollar which came down " heads " on both sides , a souvenir of the Silversmith , last of the famous forgers . . . His father 's military decorations , fragile tinplate mementoes . . . His mirror-glass pince-nez . He had ordered that pince-nez from Monsieur Vinay , whose optician 's workshop was now in the submerged part of Old Basle . His old friends from college had thought it highly amusing . Pince-nez with mirror lenses , they had guffawed ! So that you can see behind you as well as in front of you at the same time ! Why not gloves with grappling irons for arresting villains ? He cleaned the lenses of the pince-nez with a chequered handkerchief and perched them on the end of his nose . He could see the room behind him in the two half-moons of mercury at the ends of the darkened lenses . With these , you could walk straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could let him follow you . Gruber , young and therefore arrogant at the time , was planning to demonstrate his invention , patent it , and see it displayed in the main amphitheatre of the Academy , available for purchase by future investigators . In his wildest dreams whole troops of men in glasses with mirror lenses patrolled the city , followed by unsuspecting criminals . The advent of the tracers had wrecked all that , of course , and his invention had languished in the hidden compartment of that secret drawer . He took the pince-nez off again and re-read the citation signed by Archibald Fould , his departmental Minister , and received by internal mail that morning . For good and loyal service : Medal of Merit . . . a bonus on his retirement . . . grateful Security Department . . . and so on and so forth . Age had passed judgement on him . He was being retired on the first of the following month , and no one had mentioned any successor . Perhaps they 'd already decided to close the CID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
