<p> Hospitals are conceiving new programs to make childbirth safer , amid mounting evidence that overuse of labor-inducing drugs for preterm deliveries and other common practices in the delivery room are endangering both mothers and infants . <p> Driven by soaring liability-insurance premiums for their obstetrics units , hospital groups are adopting policies to discourage or prohibit births induced before the minimum 39 weeks recommended by maternal and child health experts , unless medically necessary . They are curtailing the use of drugs such as the hormone oxytocin to start or speed up contractions , which in too-high doses can lead to ruptures of the uterus , fetal distress and even death of the infant . And they are limiting the use of forceps and vacuums that can help coax babies from the birth canal but also lead to injuries such as bone fractures and nerve damage . <p> With communication breakdowns at the root of 85 percent of all adverse events reported in obstetrics units , hospitals are also taking steps to ensure better teamwork , such as making sure electronic fetal monitors that trace baby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses . <p> Despite the sharp rise in elective inductions in recent years , which may account for a third or more of all induced births in some hospitals , research shows that delivering babies even a few days early is associated with higher rates of emergency Caesarean deliveries , admissions to the neonatal intensive-care unit with respiratory distress and other problems , and longer-term health issues for children . <p> HARDER TO SCHEDULE DELIVERIES <p> The new programs are already changing the experience of childbirth in a growing number of hospitals around the country  --  making it harder to schedule deliveries on a convenient day for the doctor or patient , or to give the maximum dose of oxytocin to advance a long and difficult labor . But they are also helping to reduce risks that can lead to devastating harm . Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Healthcare began requiring doctors to obtain special permission to induce delivery earlier than 39 weeks . Intermountain , which operates hospitals in Utah and Idaho , reduced elective inductions at less than 39 weeks to 5 percent of all births today , from 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The OB is its own little world in a hospital setting , and 99 percent of the time it 's a happy and nice place , " said Kathy Connolly , assistant vice president of risk management at the insurance management unit of Premier Inc. , an alliance of 1,500 nonprofit hospitals . But obstetricians do n't always adhere to guidelines for elective induction set by groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . They often schedule deliveries around their own office hours or travel plans , and do n't always take the time to document care in patient records , increasing hospital liability , she said . <p> While harm during labor and delivery is rare , relative to the number of births , obstetrics-related cases accounted for 8.1 percent of all physician-malpractice payment reports to the National Practitioner Data Bank , a federally maintained clearinghouse that maintains data on physician conduct . The median award for a childbirth-related claim involving hospitals and obstetricians was $2.5 million between 1997 and 2003 , the highest of any specialty . <p> Managed-care giant Kaiser Permanente , with 32 hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight national regions , including drills of simulated maternal and fetal emergencies . Hospitals also are educating mothers-to-be about the risks of using oxytocin to induce labor , which both mothers and doctors sometimes push for . It 's often used to speed or jump-start labor , but if the contractions become too strong and frequent , the uterus becomes " hyperstimulated , " which may cause tearing and slow the supply of blood and oxygen to the fetus . <p> THE BIG NEWS <p> STEM CELLS MIGHT HELP INFERTILE MEN <p> In a step that may someday help infertile men , scientists produced live mice by using spermlike cells derived from embryonic stem cells . Seven mice resulted , six living long enough to reach adulthood . The work , reported in this month 's Developmental Cell journal , may help scientists learn more about sperm production . <p> Men 's lung cancer risk lower <p> Women are twice as likely as men to develop lung cancer , a new study involving nearly 17,000 smokers confirms , but the findings also suggest that women have better odds at surviving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Medical Association , adds to evidence that lung cancer behaves differently in women and that tobacco smoke affects them differently . <p> EAR INFECTION CAUSE FOUND <p> A study of children with ear infections found slimy biofilms coating their middle ears . The films protect bacteria from the body 's natural defenses and spur the body to produce gooey fluid that can become trapped in the ear . Bacteria encased in the films are especially resistant to antibiotics , according to a Journal of the American <p> Medical Association article . <p> SPENDING ON HOME CARE SOARS <p> A new study published in the July-August issue of the journal Health Affairs notes that spending on home-care services and the number of people providing those services have both soared in the past 15 years  --  but current levels may not be adequate within the next 30 to 50 years . <p> BLOOD SUBSTITUTE CHALLENGED <p> The effort to develop substitutes for human blood suffered a setback Thursday . In response to a lawsuit , the Food and Drug Administration canceled a meeting Friday to discuss the U.S. Navy 's proposed experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian trauma victims . <p> ACHES &; CLAIMS <p> Could cherry pie actually be good for you ? <p> THE CLAIM : Growers and companies marketing cherry products claim the fruit contains natural chemicals that decrease inflammation , aid sleep , soothe arthritis and even fight cancer . In additional to fresh cherries , products that claim health benefits include dried cherries for munching or cooking , cherry pie fillings , preserves and capsules sold as a dietary supplement . <p> THE EVIDENCE : There is preliminary evidence behind the claims that cherries have health benefits . About 15 years ago , Michigan State University researchers found that cherries have anti-inflammatory activity in laboratory testing similar to commonly used pain-killers . <p> More recently , researchers have found that a diet including freeze-dried cherries suppressed a type of intestinal tumor in mice . A small study even found that eating cherries lowered blood levels of uric acid , which contributes to a severe form of arthritis called gout . <p> So far the bulk of this evidence comes from research funded by growers or marketers of cherry products . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . Animal and lab studies are n't enough to probe an effect in humans , he said . <p> THE BOTTOM LINE : Evidence of benefits has been mounting , but experts say far more research is needed . Cherries wo n't hurt you and , at least in the fresh form , likely have other benefits , such as fiber . But calories can be high . Cherrypharm 's 8-oz. bottle of cherry juice has 132 calories . <p> Wall Street Journal <p> HEALTH Q &A; <p> Q. Do long hours take a bigger toll on men or women ? <p> A. Women who work long hours are more likely than men to indulge in negative behaviors such as eating high-fat and high-sugar snacks , smoking and drinking coffee , according to a study that finds men and women respond very differently to long workdays . Both men and women consume less alcohol if they spend more time working , researchers say , but toiling additional hours makes women crave unhealthful snacks , according the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Council . " For men , working longer hours has no negative impact on exercise , caffeine intake or smoking , " said Daryl O'Connor of Britain 's Leeds University . <p> Gannett News Service Photo : Is the overuse of labor-inducing drugs endangering infants ? ; Graphic/Diagram : ( See microfilm for graphic ) .
