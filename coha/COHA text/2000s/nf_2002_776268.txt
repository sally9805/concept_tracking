Introduction // In recent years , two of America 's most prominent politicians learned the peril of actively opposing the death penalty . During the 1988 presidential election , Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis stumbled in the polls after stating that he would oppose executing first-degree murderers , even , in the hypothetical case , where an offender was convicted of killing Dukakis 's wife . New York Governor Mario Cuomo 's 1994 reelection loss to a political newcomer was at least partially due to his annual vetoes of death penalty bills passed by the New York State legislature . The current strength of the nationwide death penalty movement is more clearly demonstrated by the dramatic increase in the number of federal provisions that allow capital punishment , the perception of overwhelming support for capital punishment voiced by respondents to public opinion polls , and an upsurge in the number of executions that took place during the 1990s. // The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 allows the execution of drug kingpins , persons who operate " continuing criminal enterprises " that kill , or recruit others to kill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 expanded the punishment of death to cover sixty offenses , three of which do not involve murder : espionage , treason , and large-scale drug trafficking . United States Supreme Court rulings since Furman v. Georgia have forbidden executions for non-homicidal crimes . Nevertheless , with President George W. Bush 's nomination in 2001 of former Missouri Senator John Ashcroft , a longtime death penalty advocate , to the post of U.S. attorney general , it is probable that federal prosecutors will energetically seek to enforce all capital punishment statutes . It remains to be seen how today 's federal courts will react . // According to Gallup Poll data , support for capital punishment among U.S. residents increased continuously through the 1970s and 1980s . By 1994 , fully 80 percent of Americans surveyed favored executing convicted murderers . Since that time , however , popular support for capital punishment has eroded . By year-end 2000 , 66 percent of Americans voiced support for capital punishment for convicted murderers . Moreover , that proportion declined to 50 percent when the alternative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , active support for capital punishment remains more attractive to the electorate than does active opposition to capital punishment . Dukakis and Cuomo were , in part , defeated because they openly opposed the death penalty , while George W. Bush , who , as governor of Texas , presided over more than 150 executions between 1995 and 2000 , was elected president of the United States . George W. Bush 's well-known death penalty history never became an issue during the 2000 presidential campaign . // Finally , throughout the 1980s , 117 persons were legally killed in the United States . During the 1990s , 763 death row inmates were executed , an increase of nearly 650 percent . Moreover , recent federal reforms suggest that the volume of executions could increase during the first decade of the twenty-first century . The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 , which affects both state and federal prisoners , speeds up and reduces the cost of executions . The act dictates tighter filing deadlines , limits the opportunity for evidentiary hearings , and allows only a single habeas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The continued use of capital punishment distinguishes the United States from all other Western , industrialized nations . That disparity , however , has a relatively brief history . As recently as 1820 , English Common Law provided for hanging or drawing and quartering for a vast array of offenses . Between 1765 and 1820 , the number of crimes punishable by death in England had risen to about 220 . In an 1819 petition presented to Parliament , the Corporation of London noted that " upwards of 200 crimes , very different in their degrees of enormity , are equally subject to the punishment of death , which is enacted not only for the most atrocious offenses , for burglary , for rape , for murder , and for treason , but for many offenses unattended with any cruelty or violence , for various minor crimes , and even for stealing privately to the amount of five shillings in a shop . " Circumstances were similar in the rest of Western Europe . For Europeans living in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , executions were " a sight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these years could be swift or protracted . Methods bringing relatively quick death included the following : " hanging , which was typically the most infamous form of death ; garroting , which was often the fate of female offenders ; and beheading , which was the usual end of homicides murderers and offenders who had some claim to social rank . " Prolonged executions included such punishments as " breaking on the wheel , burning , and drowning . " The mutilation of dead bodies and the exposure of corpses were also commonly practiced to demonstrate the existence and power of law . // By the beginning of the nineteenth century , the ancillary violence that often accompanied executions had disappeared . With the exception of France , Western Europe had abolished public executions by 1870 . The Netherlands , Norway , and Denmark conducted their last execution , outside of war , before the end of the nineteenth century . By the end of the twentieth century , all Western European countries had abolished capital punishment for crimes outside of war . In 1981 , under President Fran ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reject the death penalty . In 1983 , the twenty-one members of the Council of Europe solidified European aversion toward capital punishment by adding a protocol to the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . That protocol formally condemned the use of capital sentences and executions . The protocol , however , grants states the right to preserve capital punishment for acts committed " in time of war or imminent threat of war . " // During the latter part of the twentieth century , it appeared for a time that capital punishment was headed toward a similar end in the United States . During the 1930s , the United States averaged 167 executions each year , nearly 2,000 for the decade . Through the entire decade of the 1940s , 1,289 persons were executed . During the 1950s , the number of executions declined to 715 . Between 1960 and year-end 1967 , 191 persons were executed by state authorities in the United States . In 1966 , popular support for capital punishment among Americans was down to 42 percent , an all-time low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 and year-end 1976 . The downward trend in both executions and the public support for capital punishment concluded with the 1972 United States Supreme Court ruling in Furman v. Georgia that Georgia 's death statute was unconstitutional , and by extension this applied to all state and federal death penalty statutes existing at that time . // Many Americans believed that the demise of capital punishment was at hand . Nothing was further from the truth . In Gregg v. Georgia , the United States Supreme Court upheld the revised death statute of the state of Georgia . Since then , thirty-eight states have remodeled their death statutes along the lines that the Court upheld in the Gregg case , and thirty-two of those states have carried out at least one execution . Yet the forces in opposition continue to grow . Recently , over thirty major religious organizations released strong statements of opposition to the death penalty . In 1999 , the United Nations Commission on Human Rights supported a worldwide moratorium on executions in nations that maintain capital punishment . Moreover , the commission requested that other nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital punishment would not be carried out . Amnesty International noted that for the year 2000 , " 88 percent of all known executions took place in China , Iran , Saudi Arabia and the USA . " Thus , on the world stage the United States is in the company of what many describe as terrorist states . // As the numbers suggest , the movement back to capital punishment in the United States was not absolute . As of January 2001 , twelve U.S. states did not have active death penalty statutes . Here we are interested primarily in the abolitionist histories of nine states : Michigan , Wisconsin , Maine , Minnesota , North Dakota , Hawaii , Alaska , Iowa , and West Virginia . Capital punishment in those states was abolished by legislative action before 1972 when the United States Supreme Court ruled existing death statutes unconstitutional . Legislators in three of those states , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Maine , abolished their death statutes during the nineteenth century . The purpose of this book is to identify and explain the historical circumstances in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain death penalty abolition in the midst of ongoing demands for harsher criminal sanctions . Bedau has noted that while most U.S. states have the death penalty , Americans have something valuable to learn from " being told the full story of how crime and punishment , social vindictiveness , and fear of violence are managed without recourse to the threat of executions . " We hope this book will provide practical information to those interested in furthering death penalty abolition in the United States and throughout the world , as well as shed some light on the origins and maintenance of abolitionist law . // The District of Columbia also has a distinguished history of death penalty abolition . The courageous struggles waged by Washington , D.C. , residents against concerted efforts by the United States Congress to reestablish capital punishment in the District is discussed in Chapter 11 , Summary and Conclusions . This struggle in the nation 's capital reflects many of the dynamics found in the nine abolition states . Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Vermont are recognized as important death penalty abolition states ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished through legislative action but by court decisions that found capital punishment to be unconstitutional . Massachusetts is a state with a special legacy of emphasizing human rights and justice . The homogeneity of the populations of Rhode Island and Vermont has been especially conducive to the abolition of the death penalty in those states . A discussion of these three states is found in the Epilogue. // Theory // A rigorously tested , formal theory of law formation does not currently exist . In the area of criminal law , the lack of empirically grounded propositions or explanations of the existence or absence of capital punishment statutes is particularly striking . As a consequence , the research discussed here has placed " emphasis upon discovery " rather than on formal hypothesis testing . According to Sjoberg and Nett , " Discovery has been the basis for the development not only of isolated hypotheses but of theoretical systems . Thus one may uncover a set of findings and order these into some classificatory scheme or retroduce a deductive theory to account for them . " We began this study with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retention of capital punishment in the United States by examining the unique abolitionist histories of Michigan , Wisconsin , Maine , Minnesota , North Dakota , Hawaii , Alaska , Iowa , and West Virginia . Merton supports this assertion . He points out that studying deviant cases ( here abolitionist states ) " provokes curiosity ; it stimulates the investigator to make sense of the datum , " which can often lead to new theoretical insights . // Since " discovery research " necessarily lacks the direction that formal theory lends to traditional sociological research , we decided to organize this book around six empirical questions concerning state-sanctioned killing . Following is a list of those questions along with the research findings that lend support to their inclusion in our research . // 1 . What is the relationship between murder rates , the history of executions , and death penalty abolition ? Zimring and Hawkins argue that declines in the " rate of violence " will not necessarily lead to nationwide death penalty abolition . Zimring and Hawkins also argue that a history of frequent executions makes executions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A history of frequent executions ... serves as a kind of precedent , reassuring political actors that their own participation is neither inhumane nor immoral ... on grounds that , historically , executions do not violate local community morality . " Thus , in states with little tradition of executions one could expect the easiest success with abolitionist efforts . // 2 . Is economic crisis related to death penalty abolition ? Rusche and Kirchheimer argue that lethal punishment is more likely in situations where the economy is depressed and labor is expendable . // 3 . What is the relationship between public sentiment and death penalty abolition ? Fox et al . found that support for capital punishment decreases dramatically when respondents are provided the alternative of life in prison without the possibility of parole . In fact , a majority express opposition to the death penalty if they are assured that parole is not possible . // 4 . What role do political , social , and economic elites tend to play in abolition debates ? Bohm found that people in the highest income bracket are more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracket . // 5 . What is the relationship between mass media and death penalty abolition ? Evidence suggests that mass media strongly influence legislative outcomes . Hagan found in his study of legislative initiatives concerning a wide range of substantive issues , that backing from the press was crucial to the success of an initiative . In their study of legislative processes in California , Berk et al . found that the best predictor of a bill 's success or failure was the editorial position of the Los Angeles Times . // 6 . Is population diversity associated with death penalty abolition ? Civil rights organizations and the academic community routinely claim that the death penalty discriminates against economic and racial minorities . In addition , Yang and Lister found that the geographical mobility of a state 's population was a good predictor of death penalty abolition . Less heterogeneous and less mobile populations are more likely to abolish capital punishment ? // By pursuing answers to these questions we gained an appreciation for the unique combination of historical ( or structural ) foundations and cultural dispositions that have facilitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Method // This book utilizes " case study " methodology . Being able to generalize findings across time and between cases is the most obvious problem associated with this form of inquiry . Succinctly stated , it is difficult to demonstrate that findings evolving out of a case study are universal traits of a category of events . While this problem is inherent in the method , a number of social scientists contend that increasing the sample size can minimize the problem . Orum et al . suggest that the theoretical value of a case study can be reinforced by additional case studies . Several case studies centering on the same issue enable a comparative framework . Hamel et al . likewise contend that " the case study is ... only microscopic for want of ? a sufficient number ? of cases .... The problem ... is to determine exactly how many cases are needed . " To ensure the theoretical integrity of our findings , the history of the death penalty was studied in every state whose legislature abolished capital punishment and maintained abolition . Nine case studies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately in Chapters 2 through 10 . Chapter 11 integrates those findings . //
