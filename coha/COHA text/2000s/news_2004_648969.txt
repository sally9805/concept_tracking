<p> From the living room of his Colorado dream house , Tyler Hamilton sees miles of rolling hills covered with evergreens . In the distance , snow-capped mountains form the Continental Divide . The sky is muted orange , promising another magnificent sunset . <p> Behind him , around the neck of a grinning carved wood moose , hangs the Olympic gold medal he won in the cycling time trial at the Athens Games . On the walls are photographs of his golden retriever , Tugboat , who died in July and whose tag Hamilton wore inside his helmet on that winning ride . Next to the couch , a wood box holds Tugboat 's ashes , a long lock of his pale tail curling around the lid . <p> Cycling jerseys stitched for the Swiss team built for Hamilton to win the Tour de France sit neatly stacked in the laundry room . Nine custom bicycles line the walls of his garage . <p> When he turns away from the windows , he frowns . " This is the lowest point of my whole life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Hamilton , the American considered the heir apparent to Lance Armstrong , learned in September that he had tested positive for endurance-boosting blood transfusions at the Olympics and at the Vuelta a Espana . <p> At 33 , just as he seemed ready to claim center stage , Hamilton is facing a two-year suspension from competition . His lawyers expect the United States Anti-Doping Agency , which has jurisdiction over the case , to make a formal charge against him soon , and they anticipate going to arbitration in January . <p> Hamilton 's goal of winning the 2005 Tour de France is slipping away . He stands a good chance of missing the Tour , a race Armstrong has won six consecutive times but is expected to skip . <p> Anti-doping experts involved in the case say Hamilton is guilty , and Olympic officials are not convinced of his innocence . That keeps Hamilton and his wife , Haven , awake at night . They read arcane scientific data on blood doping to learn what they will be up against when he presents his case . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arbitration for Sport , the highest court of international athletics . <p> He has a lot at stake . His Swiss team , Phonak , pays him a high-six-figure salary . He also has endorsement deals with companies like Nike , Clif Bar and Oakley , putting his yearly income well above $1 million . <p> Now sponsors are wary . Some fellow competitors are retreating . And recently , a World Anti-Doping Agency spokesman said Hamilton had kept his Olympic medal only because of a laboratory error . " After the Olympics , my life was really secure , my career was really on track because the gold medal can bring you a lot , you know ? " Hamilton says . " Now my life is on hold . " <p> Hamilton , a sliver of a man at 5 feet 8 inches and 130 pounds , makes eye contact as he says : " I would be happier without everything I have , with nothing , if I could just clear my name . If I had to , I 'd give up everything , down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> A Test Failed <p> Hamilton , the first American to win a road racing Olympic gold in 20 years , left Athens in late August and headed for the Vuelta a Espana . On Sept. 11 , he won an individual time trial . Five nights later , he rose from a massage table to be met by Alvaro Pino , the director of his Phonak team . <p> " You 've been accused of transfusing blood from a different person , " in the Vuelta , Hamilton said Pino told him . <p> Homologous blood doping , the practice of transfusing another person 's blood to increase the amount of oxygen-carrying red blood cells , has been against the rules in cycling since the late 1980 's . It improves athletes ' endurance but can spread disease and even cause death . <p> Hamilton , the first athlete with a positive result since the test 's introduction this year , said he was stunned . His requests for additional screening and a DNA test were denied . " This ca n't be right , " he said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this out , do n't worry . " <p> Hamilton dropped out of the Vuelta that day and headed to his condominium in Girona , Spain . Haven , his wife , was in Massachusetts with her family . Tugboat was gone . He opened the door to an empty , painful feeling . <p> Hamilton is known for coping with pain . A year after leaving his job as Armstrong 's lieutenant on the United States Postal Service team , Hamilton raced the 2002 Giro d'Italia despite a broken shoulder , grinding 11 teeth to their nerves . In the 2003 Tour de France , he broke his collarbone early but finished fourth . During the sixth stage of this year 's Tour , Hamilton flew over his handlebars and landed on his back . But he did not drop out of the race until the 13th stage , three days after the cancer-stricken Tugboat was euthanized . <p> But that night in Spain , the pain sickened him . On the Internet , he researched homologous blood doping . Hamilton said he was restless , the sleeping pill from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was there a mix-up with blood samples ? Were Europeans out to get an American ? <p> " We felt like all the air had rushed out of our lungs , " Haven , 35 , said . <p> The situation worsened two days later , he said , when he learned that a blood sample at the Olympics had also shown evidence of a transfusion . <p> During the next few days , Hamilton twice drove to Switzerland , first for Phonak 's news conference on his test results , then to spend two days in a lab watching scientists test his second , or B , samples from the Vuelta and the Olympics . " It was so important to me to see the procedure , " he says . " They had my life in that vial . " <p> The Olympics and professional cycling use the same testing procedures . Each blood sample is divided . If the A sample is positive , the B is tested to confirm the initial result . Without confirmation , the entire test is deemed negative . <p> On Aug. 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sample negative but labeled it suspicious for a blood transfusion . On the recommendation of external experts called in to examine the results , the I.O.C. declared Hamilton 's A sample positive on Sept. 16 , nearly a month after he won the gold medal . By then , the I.O.C. knew that a lab technician had frozen Hamilton 's B sample , leaving too few red blood cells to analyze . On Sept. 23 , the Olympic B sample was called inconclusive , so Hamilton kept his medal , but the B sample from the Vuelta came out positive . <p> " It 's obvious that the lab there had no idea what they were doing , and it makes you question the entire drug-testing process , " Hamilton said . " But it 's too late for me . I 'm just their guinea pig . They already ruined my life because of their mistakes . " <p> Drug testing and drug scandals have long played a part in international cycling . In 1967 , a rider died during the Tour de France , and an autopsy revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 , and random blood testing began about four years ago . <p> In the 1998 Tour de France , the top-ranked Festina team was expelled amid a doping investigation . This year , David Millar was stripped of his 2003 world championship and suspended for using erythropoietin , EPO , a synthetic red-blood-cell booster . <p> Also this year , Hamilton 's teammate Oscar Camenzind was suspended for EPO use ; another teammate , Santiago Perez , tested positive for traces of another person 's blood on Oct. 27 . Still , Hamilton insists that cycling " is not a dirty sport " and that the blood-doping test is faulty . <p> But Michael Ashenden , an Australian physiologist and head researcher on a team of scientists who this year developed the test for homologous blood doping , said there was no doubt of its reliability . The World Anti-Doping Agency approved the test for the Athens Games . The International Cycling Union began using it at this summer 's Tour de France . <p> The original test , Ashenden said , has been used for more than a decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother with an incompatible blood type . <p> " The knee-jerk reaction of a team that is faced with a sanction is that the test is new , so it 's problematic , " Ashenden said . " But you just do n't use a test a million times and then it suddenly does n't work . This is n't a new test . It just has n't been used in sports for very long . " <p> He added : " It 's too bad that an athlete very seldom has the moral courage to admit : ' Yes , I did this . I 'm guilty . " ' <p> Hamilton vows he 's innocent . His wife said : " I want to scream it from the rooftops and say Tyler is innocent . But we have to be methodical now , like we 're doing a really hard crossword puzzle . " <p> On the Offense <p> Days after Hamilton 's B test results were announced , Haven flew to Spain . They decided he should honor his commitments . <p> " I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hamilton said . " I have nothing to hide . " <p> He spent eight days in the Pyrenees filming an IMAX movie about the brain 's reaction to emotions and pain , to be released next fall . Next , he flew to Las Vegas for the Interbike trade show , beginning the journey to salvage his reputation . He said his heart beat quickly as he arrived , the Strip aglow , thousands of people in the tight-knit biking world about to see him for the first time since his positive tests . <p> The Interbike show , North America 's largest cycling trade show , covered 660,000 square feet in the Sands Expo and Convention Center . Amid a maze of booths with $5,000 bikes , $25 socks , energy bars , heart- rate monitors and hydration backpacks was Tyler Hamilton , considered the nicest , most polite person in cycling . <p> Hamilton , who has boyish looks and a freckled , tan face , walked through the doors , nervous and blushing slightly . But at 15 appearances over two days , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his autograph , asked for photos , shook hands . Some offered condolences for Tugboat . <p> One of his sponsors , Bell Helmets , gave away " I Believe Tyler " buttons . One man wearing that button proudly was Andy Rihs , the chairman of Phonak , a Swiss hearing aid company , and the boss of Hamilton 's team . Rihs , who suspended Hamilton with pay , said he had spent $800,000 on Hamilton 's defense , hiring five scientists to study the blood-doping test and its validity . <p> " We wanted a clear second opinion because this new test is a little black box with a thousand questions in it , " Rihs said . <p> One American cyclist at the show , Bobby Julich , had other questions . Julich had roomed with Hamilton in Athens and won the bronze medal in the time trial . He said the suspicions about Hamilton " go against everything I 've ever known from the guy . " But , he added : " The rest of us at the Olympics passed the test . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm sick of people who cheat , sick of cleaning up their mess and trying to explain it , " he said . <p> Then , a pause . <p> " There is heavy evidence against him , " he said . " With that much evidence , I do n't know how he 's going to get out of it . " <p> Facing His Public <p> After the embrace at Interbike , Hamilton prepared for two weeks of more difficult appearances at events for the Tyler Hamilton Foundation , which raises money for multiple sclerosis patients and for youth cycling . He started the foundation this year , modeling it after Armstrong 's cancer foundation . <p> At his first stop , in a 437-seat San Francisco theater , 100 people heard him speak . When Hamilton 's friend Chris Davenport , an extreme skier who served as emcee , said , " Tyler is innocent , " most of the audience applauded . <p> But one man sat silent , arms tightly crossed , a disgusted look on his face as Hamilton 's Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steffen , who had worked with Hamilton and the United States Postal Service team . <p> In the book " L.A. Confidential , the Secrets of Lance Armstrong , " Steffen said Hamilton had been present when another rider , Marty Jemison , hinted that performance-enhancing drugs could help the team . <p> Steffen said he had refused the request and that his contract with the team was not renewed . <p> " If he had the guts to show up in my town and talk , I needed to be there , " Steffen said of Hamilton . " I knew this would happen . After the news got out that he tested positive , I got lots of calls and e-mails , people saying , ' Yeah , Prentice wins ! " ' <p> Hamilton responded , " He 's just mad that he got fired . " <p> From San Francisco , Hamilton and his wife returned to their refuge , their gray slate house high above Boulder , the home of the University of Colorado . The 4,200-square-foot home is appointed with a decorator 's touch : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand piano . <p> It is far removed from the hubbub of European cycling , and near friends and endless bike trails , one of which leads to the door . <p> Because the Hamiltons are apart 200 days a year while he trains and races , their time together is precious . But now , they worry that the stress will crack their tight bond . She says they argue more . He says their relationship is now " all business . " <p> Haven Parchinski was working at an advertising agency in Boston when she met Hamilton at a cycling race in 1996 . Married to Tyler for six years , she now she has another job : helping her husband restore his reputation . These days , she is answering the phone , returning his calls and rerecording their voice mail message in her voice . " I want to protect him , " she says . <p> For a distraction , they are thinking about replacing Tugboat . Hamilton wants two golden retrievers . His wife agrees . <p> " It 's better , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says , looking him in the eye . <p> The next night , the Hamiltons took the stage for another foundation talk , for about 300 people at the University of Colorado . He raced on its ski team until he broke two vertebrae in a mountain biking accident . Then he focused on cycling and became an even bigger name in town . <p> When Hamilton was introduced , his father , Bill , was the first to leap to his feet . " We believe in you , Tyler ! " he shouted . <p> The next morning , Hamilton and his father and brother  --  who flew in from Marblehead , Mass.  --  rolled into a parking lot on bikes for a charity ride . Counting friends , relatives and foundation workers , the ride attracted 40 people . Two weeks before , Armstrong 's Ride for the Roses , a cancer fund-raiser in Austin , Tex. , drew 6,500 . <p> The Yellow Jersey <p> In his bright living room , Hamilton cradles his Olympic gold medal in his hands . He says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear " The Star-Spangled Banner , " to be an Olympic champion . Not even Armstrong achieved that . <p> " Cool , huh ? " Hamilton says . <p> But Dr. Jacques Rogge , the International Olympic Committee president , and Dick Pound , the chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency , have suggested Hamilton does not deserve the medal . And two national Olympic committees have filed protests to strip Hamilton of it . <p> The Russian committee has asked the Court of Arbitration for Sport to award it to Vyacheslav Ekimov , who finished second in the time trial . The Australian committee has asked that Michael Rogers , who finished fourth , receive the bronze . <p> That only strengthens Hamilton 's resolve . " I earned it fair and square , and there is not a chance that someone else is going to get it , " he says of the gold . " I guarantee it . " <p> An angry yet uncertain Hamilton says : " I 'm a nice person and I try to forgive people , but not this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust in people because they have backed off from me when I needed them the most . When my name is cleared , I 'm going to remember those people . They 'd better not come crawling back to me when this is all over . " <p> Some friends have not left . Armstrong sent an encouraging e-mail message . Davenport has set up www.believetyler.org , which collects donations on the Web for Hamilton 's defense . Just as an injury led him away from skiing and toward cycling , this ordeal may lead Hamilton to another phase of his life . He talks about organizing a union to promote cyclists ' rights , including approval of drug-testing procedures . <p> Whatever may happen , Hamilton has begun training for next season . Pedaling through each workout , he says , he thinks of one thing . Not of his uncertain future . Not of his appeal . Not even of his beloved Tugboat . <p> He thinks of the Tour de France . <p> He imagines himself wearing the leader 's yellow jersey as he cruises down the Champs-Elysees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a champion . <p> " Even if I 'm suspended for two years , I 'll come back just to show those people who doubted me that they were wrong , " he says . " I would come back and win the Tour de France , for my sport , for me , for everyone who has believed in me . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com right , Eric Risberg/Associated Press )
