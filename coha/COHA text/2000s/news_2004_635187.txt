<p> On the surface , an airport terminal is a mass of anticipation . People are moving toward vacation , reunion , bereavement and business . No one looks back . No one likes to stand still . Lack of movement means loss of control . <p> It is easy to arrive at these conclusions after spending 24 consecutive hours at O'Hare International Airport . Earlier this month I set out to replicate the ordeal of Tom Hanks ' character in the Steven Spielberg movie " The Terminal , " which opens Friday . Hanks plays a traveler whose eastern European homeland erupts in a coup while he is flying to New York . He is stranded in Kennedy Airport without a passport . He is forced to improvise days and nights in the terminal 's international transit lounge until the war is over . <p> I purchased a United Airlines ticket , but I was going nowhere . The ticket was the pass I needed to roam the airport from noon one day until noon the next . It was a long holding pattern , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night in International Terminal 5 , a refuge for travelers in the wee , wee hours of the morning . It is the terminal that never sleeps . Terminal 5 has the only 24-hour restaurants at O'Hare : Lou Mitchell 's Express , Gold Coast Dogs , Windy City Frozen Yogurt . After snacking on a bagel and a bottle of water , I slept between 2 and 4 a.m. on a cold Naugahyde bench in Terminal 5 . <p> Cleaning crews of immigrants worked around me . One man with a big brushy black mustache operated a large scrubber machine . As the machine spun around near and far , I tricked myself into hearing the rhythm of the noisy engine as roaring waves from an inviting ocean . Another woman in a light blue smock wiped the Naugahyde chairs . No one disturbed me . I felt like a potted plant . <p> I woke up wilted , with a sore throat , unsure of my place in the world . <p> After 24 hours , O'Hare does n't seem like such a big place . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athletic Club in the basement of the hotel adjacent to the airport . The facility also includes weight training equipment , a dry sauna and a pool . If you are stuck at O'Hare and need to freshen up , a one-day $10 membership will get you into a shower . Need to send a Moneygram ? There 's a basement Currency Exchange , next door to the ORD Chicago gift shop in the hotel basement , on the path to Terminal 2 . <p> An interfaith chapel is open 24 hours a day on the mezzanine level of Terminal 2 . Since it 's one of the few places where visitors need not have plane tickets , homeless people use the 88-seat chapel for respite . When I dropped in around 1 a.m. , I saw one traveler sleeping on the floor between luggage carts and chairs , while a homeless man was snoring elsewhere on the floor . A floral arrangement near the pulpit commemorated the 25th anniversary of Flight 191 , the jet that crashed while leaving O'Hare for Los Angeles and left 271 people dead . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 a.m. , " said the Rev. Michael Zaniolo , a Northwest Side native . " A couple of weeks ago we had a girl from Idaho who was traveling to India . She had never been on an airplane before . " <p> The woman missed her connection due to bad weather . Air India has just one daily departure , so she was stuck at O'Hare . She spent the night in the chapel . Zaniolo brought her coffee and food the next morning . " She said how she was going to Calcutta to follow in the footsteps of Mother Teresa , " he said in astonished tones . " A farm girl from Idaho . " <p> Zaniolo became chaplain at O'Hare on Jan. 1 , 2001 . A rabbi serves on the chapel board , and an imam is on call to serve Muslim travelers . " You can always feel the busy nature of the airport , " Zaniolo said . " But you feel a sense of peace in here . " <p> **** <p> The University of Illinois operates a medical center on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chapel . Emergency treatment , X-rays and immunizations are offered between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m . Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m . Saturday , Sunday and holidays . <p> Ticketed passengers may visit the Children 's Museum , directly below the chapel in Terminal 2 . Developed by the Chicago Aviation Department and the Chicago Children 's Museum at Navy Pier , the museum has interactive exhibits including an air traffic control tower and fantasy helicopter . <p> I did not hang around here . I was alone and had a two-day growth of beard that complemented my faded khaki shorts , green T-shirt and Converse high-tops . As time moved on , I scared more and more adults , let alone children . <p> Between 180,000 and 200,000 people pass through O'Hare each day , according to Aviation Department spokeswoman Monique Bond . It is easy for someone to get lost and found . I heard one story of a homeless man who shuffles between Terminals 1 , 2 and 3 on schedule . ( There is no Terminal 4 ) . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around 8 p.m. , I enjoyed one of the best sunsets at O'Hare from the Terminal 1 food court . But a little more than an hour later , Terminals 1 , 2 and 3 were ghost towns . Smooth jazz rolling through the concourses ( played by Chicago artists ) became rougher to take . I will always recall this grueling excursion as my own Ramsey Lewis &; Clark Expedition . <p> Travelers Aid has been around since 1851 , about as long as the real Lewis &; Clark . America 's oldest social service agency was started in St. Louis to help wagon train travelers . " People feel overwhelmed , " said Travelers Aid administrator Carol King during a morning conversation in her office . " One question we get the most is ' Where is Terminal 2 ? ' We 're in Terminal 2 . People are disoriented when they are in an airport . We 're available for stranded people . We make phone calls domestically and internationally . We also work with the homeless through O'Hare Outreach , " run by the Haymarket Center alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . <p> King has been working with Travelers Aid since the late 1970s . Travelers Aid is found in 23 airports across America . The O'Hare branch consists of a paid staff of five and 30 volunteers . " Lately we 've had lots of requests to assist passengers from India , " King said while sitting in front of a wall-sized map of the world . " They are going to Kansas because there is a big tech community with a huge Sprint campus . These are parents and grandparents coming to visit their children . They have n't traveled before and they need help . We meet their international flights and get them through customs and immigration and go with them to their domestic flights . " Travelers Aid is resourceful . In the past King and her staff have called area ethnic restaurants to break through language barriers . <p> My stomach growled . King looked around . I explained the need for some kind of all-night food service in Terminals 1 , 2 and 3 . More than one traveler approached a forlorn figure like myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks to a vendor at a news kiosk , I learned about Terminal 5 . I told King that the Aviation Department at least could install vending machines for ticketed passengers . King wrote down my food for thought . <p> **** <p> My initial flight was scheduled to leave at 8 p.m. for St. Louis . <p> I carried an overnight bag with a computer and a reissued copy of Jim Brosnan 's baseball classic The Long Season . My late-night meeting was " canceled , " so I rebooked myself on a morning flight the next day . I was " stranded . " By 9 p.m . I was looking for a beer and a burger . The Berghoff on Concourse C in Terminal 1 was closing , but bartender Genevive Romo told me to come back in the morning when she would reopen . Romo was working a double shift , returning at 6:30 a.m . <p> " One time I worked a morning shift and served this guy , " Romo recalled . " The next day he was there . Then the next day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three days . Same clothes . Same look . I do n't know if it was a standby , but it was during a holiday weekend and it was hard to get out . " <p> It is also hard for someone to get a smoke at O'Hare , a non-smoking facility . At Hartsfield- Jackson Atlanta International Airport , which calls itself the world 's busiest airport , five of the six concourses have at least one smoking lounge . At O'Hare , smoking is permitted only in certain airlines ' members-only lounges . <p> " The biggest complaint I hear is having to leave the airport to have a cigarette , " Romo said . " If you 're all the way in Concourse C in the United terminal , it takes 20 minutes if you walk fast to get outside to light a cigarette . And then you have to come back through security . Man , you got some ornery people . I used to smoke , so I feel for them . " <p> Romo , 27 , picked up a cardboard Berghoff coaster . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear these up . They do n't know there 's layers in between , but there are . You get people who try to sneak a smoke in the corner , but you smell it . Of course , there 's smokers in the bathroom . " <p> The off hours at O'Hare are a deeper shade of blue . Around 10 p.m . I found a discarded blue airplane pillow at gate C6 that I stuffed in my bag . The pillow helped for my on-the-spot siesta . As midnight neared , flight departure information flickered away like a sleepy city skyline . The information screens became a sea of blue . By midnight I had spent 12 hours at O'Hare and the concourse lighting burned my eyes . <p> I wandered back to the Hilton and found the last Gaslight Club in America tucked in the west end of the lobby . The Gaslight started in 1953 as a private club on Chicago 's Gold Coast . Co-founder Burton Browne set out to re-create a 1920s speakeasy with Dixieland jazz , mysterious slots in the doors and servers dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an influence for Hugh Hefner 's Playboy Clubs . ( During the mid-1980s former playmate Jo Collins managed the Gaslight Club in the Palmer House . ) The O'Hare Gaslight Club opened in 1973 . <p> I hit the Gaslight Club around 12:30 a.m . Some Asian travelers were finishing off a steak dinner in the Top Hat room . Piano player Lori Hall was gathering up her songbooks . No one was at the bar . Bartender Katie Dahl was watching " The Oprah Winfrey Show . " Oprah was talking about " the Hole in the Penis Club . " Her studio audience was laughing . <p> The Gaslight Club 's majestic crystal chandelier was imported from a German castle . The room is bordered by fuzzy red baroque wallpaper , and a framed picture of Jimmy Durante with Palmer House Gaslight Girls hangs on a wall . You do n't have to leave O'Hare to travel to 1968 . " A lot of people do n't know we 're here , " Dahl said . " We 're not a part of the Hilton , and they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Dabizljevic leases the space . <p> Dahl , 24 , is a former server at the Redhead piano bar in Chicago . She said , " We get an international clientele , and most of the girls who work here are foreign . We 've got four from Poland , one from Macedonia , one from Romania , one from Lithuania , one from Australia . " <p> Dahl is from 82nd and Pulaski . She has worked at the Gaslight for two years and has served her share of stranded travelers . " One guy missed his flight to Scotland , " she said . " He just sat at my bar and kept throwing his money at me and got a hotel room here . I do n't think he ever went . " Not long ago John Travolta visited the club , surely in search of some 1970s Saturday night fever . The Gaslight Club is open from 11 a.m. until 1 a.m . Monday through Friday . The club is open from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m . Saturday and Sunday . <p> **** <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive again around 5 a.m . I took a half-hour catnap at Gate C21 and awoke to see Indianapolis Colts football coach Tony Dungy . He stared at me . I looked like I had run 50 laps . <p> And here 's a tip for stranded travelers . Most airport benches are divided by armrests every other seat to prevent sleepers from getting too comfortable . But Gate C21 has a rare three-seater ( without armrests ) , which allows a 6-foot-2 person like myself to stretch out . <p> I stumbled back to security to catch my new flight to St. Louis . For the second time in less than 24 hours , I was pulled out by the Transportation Security Administration for a secondary search . I travel a fair amount , and this never happened to me . <p> " It is getting worse , " groaned a middle-age German businessman and fellow member of the Secondary Search Club . Then he asked , " Are you from Europe ? " I said I was from Chicago . He nodded and replied , " I wondered because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I was n't going anywhere . <p> The terminal was going to control my destiny . <p> Hold on , Atlanta , Chicago says our airport is busiest <p> So was I stranded at the world 's busiest airprort ? <p> Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport claims to be the world 's busiest . Not so fast , says Monique Bond , spokeswoman for the Chicago Aviation Department . <p> " O'Hare is the world 's busiest , " she said . " Airports Council International defines busiest as the most ' operations , ' meaning takeoffs and landings . This is where O'Hare exceeds Hartsfield . The reason Hartsfield calls themselves the world 's busiest is because they have more passengers . But we are technically the world 's busiest . " <p> Between 180,000 and 200,000 people pass through O'Hare every day . It is easy for someone to get lost and found . <p> It 's difficult to have a cigarette at O'Hare , a non-smoking facility . Smoking is permitted only in certain airlines ' members-only lounges .
