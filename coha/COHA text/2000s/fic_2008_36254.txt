Who is he , this young man who strolls toward us down Regent Street , a carnation in his collar and a cane in his hand ? We may deduce that he is well off , since he is dressed in the most fashionable clothes  --  but we would be wrong ; we may deduce that he likes fine things , since he stops to look in the window of Liberty , the new department store devoted to the latest styles  --  or is that simply his own reflection he is admiring , the curling locks that brush his shoulders , quite unlike the other passersby ? We may deduce that he is hungry , since his footsteps speed up noticeably as they take him toward the Cafe Royal , that labyrinth of gossip and dining rooms off Piccadilly ; and that he is a regular here , from the way he greets the waiter by name , and takes a Pall Mall Gazette from the rack as he moves toward a table . Perhaps we may even conclude that he is a writer , from the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carries . <br> Come along ; I am going to introduce you . Yes , I admit it  --  I know this ludicrous young man , and soon you will know him , too . Perhaps after an hour or two in his company you will consider you know him a little too well . I doubt that you will like him very much : that is of no consequence , I do not like him very much myself . He is  --  well , you will see what he is . But perhaps you may be able to see past that , and imagine what he will become . Just as coffee does not reveal its true flavor until it has been picked , husked , roasted and brewed , so this particular specimen has one or two virtues to go along with his vices , although you may have to look a little harder to spot them . . . . Despite his faults , you see , I retain a sort of exasperated affection for the fellow . <br> The year is 1896 . His name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is me , my younger self , many years ago . <br> <br> Chapter Two <br> In 1895 I had been sent down from Oxford , having failed my Preliminary Examinations . My expulsion surprised no one but myself : I had done little work , and had chosen as my associates young men notable for their idleness and dissolution . I learned very little  --  or perhaps it is fairer to say that I learned too much ; those were the days , you will recall , when undergraduates chanted Swinburne as they rioted down the High  --  Could you hurt me , sweet lips , though I hurt you ? / Men touch them , and change in a trice / The lilies and languors of virtue / For the raptures and roses of vice  --  and the college servants still talked in shocked tones of Pater and Wilde . Among the monkish cloisters a mood of languid romanticism prevailed , which prized beauty , youth and indolence above all things , and the young Robert Wallis imbibed this dangerous doctrine along with all the other heady aromas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my father 's allowance on silk waistcoats , fine wines , brilliant peacock feathers , slim volumes of verse bound in yellow vellum , and other objects essential to the artistic life , all of which were available on ready credit from the tradesmen of the Turl . Since my talent for poetry , like my allowance , was actually rather more meager than I cared to acknowledge , it was inevitable that this state of affairs would eventually come to a sorry end . By the time I was sent down I had exhausted both my funds and my father 's patience , and I was soon faced with the necessity of finding a source of income  --  a necessity which , I am ashamed to say , I intended to ignore for as long as possible . <br> London at that time was a great , seething cesspit of humanity ; yet , even in that dung-heap , lilies grew  --  indeed , they flourished . Out of nowhere , it seemed , there had come upon the capital a sudden outpouring of frivolity . The Queen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her attention , the Prince began to enjoy himself , and where he led , the rest of us followed . Courtiers mingled with courtesans , dandies moved among the demi-monde , aristocrats dined with aesthetes , and rough trade mixed with royalty . Our house magazine was the Yellow Book ; our emblem was the green carnation ; our style was what came to be known as nouveau , and our mode of speech was the epigram  --  the more paradoxical the better , preferably tossed into the conversation with a certain practiced , weary melancholy . We celebrated the artificial above the natural , the artistic above the practical , and , Oscar Wilde notwithstanding , laid claim to extravagant vices which few of us had any intention of actually indulging . It was a glorious time to be young and in London , and I was to miss most of it  --  curse it !  --  all because of a chance remark I happened to make in the hearing of a man named Pinker . <br> <br> Chapter Three <br> The primary factor affecting the taste is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Coffee Cupper 's Handbook <br> *** <br> I was having breakfast in the Cafe Royal  --  a plate of oysters and a dish of thickly sliced ham with green sauce  --  when the waiter brought my coffee . Without looking up from my newspaper I drank some , frowned , and said , " Damn it , Marsden , this coffee tastes rusty . " <br> " It 's ver same as all ver other customers is drinking , " the waiter said haughtily . " None of vem , as I 'm aware , have seen the necessity for complaint . " <br> " Are you saying I 'm pernickety , Marsden ? " <br> " Will there be anyfink else , sir ? " <br> " As a waiter , Marsden , you have mastered every skill except waiting . As a wit , you have mastered every requirement except humor . " <br> " Fank you , sir . " <br> " And yes , I am pernickety . For a well-made cup of coffee is the proper beginning to an idle day . Its aroma is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind only bitterness and regret . In that it resembles , surely , the pleasures of love . " Rather pleased with this apercu , I again sipped the coffee that Marsden had brought . " Although in this case , " I added , " it seems to taste of nothing much except mud . With , perhaps , a faint aftertaste of rotten apricots . " <br> " My pleasure , sir . " <br> " I do n't doubt it . " I turned my attention back to the Gazette . <br> The waiter lingered a moment . " Will ver young gentleman be paying for his breakfast this morning ? " he inquired , with just a trace of fashionably weary melancholy . <br> " On my tab , please , Marsden . There 's a good fellow . " <br> *** <br> After a while I became aware that someone had joined me at my table . Glancing over my newspaper , I saw that my companion was a small gnome-like gentleman , whose sturdy frock coat marked him out from the usual swells and dandies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be joined at any moment by my friends Morgan and Hunt , but since the hour was early and the room mostly unoccupied , it would be no great inconvenience to move to another table when they arrived . I was , however , somewhat curious , since the same surfeit of tables made it all the more surprising that the stranger should sit at mine uninvited . <br> " Samuel Pinker , sir , at your service , " the gnome-like gentleman said , with a slight inclination of his head . <br> " Robert Wallis . " <br> " I could not help overhearing your remark to that waiter . May I ? " And without further ado he reached for my cup , raised it to his nostrils , and sniffed it as delicately as I had that morning sniffed the flower I had chosen for my buttonhole . <br> I watched him , unsure whether to be wary or amused . Many eccentric characters frequented the Cafe Royal , to be sure , but their eccentricity was generally of a more affected kind , such as carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diamond-topped cane . Smelling another customer 's coffee was , so far as I knew , unheard of . <br> Samuel Pinker seemed unperturbed . His eyes half closed , he inhaled the aroma of the coffee twice more , very deliberately . He put it to his lips and sipped it . Then he made a curious sucking sound , together with a tiny snake-like flicker of his tongue , as if he were swilling the liquid around his mouth . <br> " Neilgherry , " he said regretfully . " Over-brewed , not to mention over-roasted . You are quite right , though . Part of the batch was spoiled . The taste of rotting fruit is faint , but quite pronounced . May I ask whether you are in the trade ? " <br> " Which trade ? " <br> " Why , the coffee trade . " <br> I think I laughed out loud . " Good heavens , no . " <br> " Then may I ask , sir , " he persisted , " what trade you are in ? " <br> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive me  --  I should have said , what is your profession ? " <br> " I do not profess anything very much . I am neither a doctor , nor a lawyer , nor anything useful . " <br> " What do you do , sir ? " he said impatiently . " How do you support yourself ? " <br> The truth was that I did not support myself just then , my father having recently advanced me a further small sum against literary greatness , with strict injunctions that there would be no more . However , it seemed absurd to quibble over definitions . " I am a poet , " I confessed , with a certain weary melancholy . <br> " A famous one ? A great one ? " Pinker asked eagerly . <br> " Alas , no . Fame has not yet clasped me to her fickle breast . " <br> " Good , " he muttered , surprisingly . Then : " But you can write ? You can use words well enough ? " <br> " As a writer I consider myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confound these epigrams ! " Pinker cried . " I mean  --  can you describe ? Well , of course you can . You described this coffee . " <br> " Did I ? " <br> " You called it ' rusty . ' Yes  --  and ' rusty ' it is . I should never have thought of it  --  the word would not have come to me  --  but ' rusty ' is the , the . . . " <br> " The mot juste ? " <br> " Exactly . " Pinker gave me a look that reminded me of my Oxford tutor  --  a look which combined doubt with a certain steely determination . " Enough talk . I am going to give you my card . " <br> " I shall certainly accept it , " I said , mystified , " although I believe I am unlikely to have need of your services . " <br> He was scribbling something briskly on the back of his business card . It was , I could not help noticing , a rather fine card , made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is I who have need of you . " <br> " You mean , as some kind of secretary ? I 'm afraid I  --  " <br> Pinker shook his head . " No , no . I have three secretaries already , all extremely proficient in their duties . You , if I may say so , would make a very poor addition to their number . " <br> " What , then ? " I asked , somewhat piqued . I had absolutely no desire to become a secretary , but I had always liked to believe that I was capable of it should the occasion arise . <br> " My need , " Pinker said , looking me in the eye , " is for an aesthete  --  a writer . When I have found this gifted individual , he will join me in an enterprise which will make fantastically wealthy men of us both . " He handed me the card . " Call on me at this address tomorrow afternoon . " <br> *** <br> It was my friend George Hunt 's opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it had long been an ambition of Hunt 's to do exactly that  --  principally because no existing literary magazine in London had yet seen fit to accept his verses  --  he believed I should take up the coffee merchant 's offer and call . <br> " He hardly seemed a literary type . " I turned the card over . On the back was written in pencil , Admit to my office , please . S.P. <br> " Look around you , " Hunt said , waving a hand at our surroundings . " This place is full of those who clutch at the petticoats of the Muse . " It was true that there were often as many hangers-on in the Cafe Royal as there were writers or artists . <br> " But he particularly liked it that I called the coffee ' rusty . ' " <br> The third member of our group  --  the artist Percival Morgan , who had so far taken no part in the speculation  --  suddenly laughed . " I know what your Mr. Pinker wants . " <br> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gazette . " ' Branah 's patented invigorating powders , ' " he read aloud . " ' Guaranteed to restore rosy health to the convalescent . Enjoy the effervescent vigor of the alpine rest cure in a single efficacious spoonful . ' It 's obvious , is n't it  --  the man wants you to write his advertising . " <br> I had to admit that this sounded much more likely than a magazine . Pinker had specifically asked if I was good at describing  --  an odd sort of question for a magazine proprietor , but one that made perfect sense for someone who wanted advertisements composed . Doubtless he simply had a new coffee he wished to push . Pinker 's pick-me-up breakfast blend . Richly roasted for a healthy complexion , or some such nonsense . I felt an obscure sense of disappointment . For a moment I had hoped  --  well , that it might be something more exciting . <br> " Advertising , " Hunt said thoughtfully , " is the unspeakable expression of an unspeakable age . " <br> " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the only form of modern art to concern itself , however remotely , with the truth . " <br> They looked at me expectantly . But for some reason I was no longer in the mood for epigrams . <br> *** <br> The following afternoon saw me sitting at my desk , working on a translation of a poem by Baudelaire . At my side , a goblet of pale Venetian glass was filled with golden Rhenish wine ; I was writing with a silver pencil on mauve paper infused with oil of bergamot , and I was smoking innumerable cigarettes of Turkish tobacco , all in the approved manner . Even so , it was utterly tedious work . Baudelaire , of course , is a great poet , and thrillingly perverse , but he also tends to be somewhat vague , which makes the translator 's job a slow one , and were it not for the three pounds a publisher had promised me for the work , I would have jacked it in several hours ago . My rooms were in St. John 's Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sunny spring day such as this I could hear the distant cries of the ice-cream sellers as they paced back and forth by the gates . It made staying inside rather difficult . And for some reason , the only word I could think of that rhymed with " vice " was " strawberry ice . " <br> " Hang it , " I said aloud , putting down my pencil . <br> Pinker 's card lay on one side of the desk . I picked it up and looked at it again . Samuel pinker , coffee <br> importer and distributor . An address in Narrow Street , Limehouse . The thought of getting out of my rooms , if only for an hour or two , tugged at me like a dog pulling at its master 's leash . <br> On the other side of the desk was a pile of bills . Of course , it was inevitable that a poet should have debts . In fact you could scarcely call yourself an artist if you did not . But just for a moment , I grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to pay them off . I fingered the top one , a chit from my wine merchant . The Rhenish wine was not only golden in color : it had cost damn nearly as much as gold as well . Whereas if I agreed to do Mr. Pinker 's advertisements . . . I had no idea what a person charged to write those bits of nonsense . But then , I reasoned , the fact that Pinker had resorted to hanging around the Cafe Royal in search of a writer suggested that he was as much a novice at this as I was . Supposing he could be prevailed upon to give me , not just a lump sum , but a retainer ? Say that it was  --  I reached for a reasonable sum and then , finding it not enough , quadrupled it  --  forty pounds a year ? And if the coffee merchant had other friends , business acquaintances , who wanted the same sort of service  --  why , it would n't be long before a man had an income of four hundred pounds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effervescent vigor of the alpine rest-cure in a single efficacious spoonful . " There would still be plenty of time left over for Baudelaire . True , the Muse might feel somewhat slighted that one was prostituting one 's talents in this way , but since one would have to keep the whole business secret from one 's literary acquaintances in any case , perhaps the Muse might not find out either . <br> Continues ...
