New Trends in Baby Products <p> While the U.S. birth rate has been nearly flat over the last decade , the juvenile-products industry has grown at a fast clip - to $4.86 billion in 1998 . We attended the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association ( JPMA ) trade show in late October and gained insight into how companies manage to sell more and more stuff for the same number of infants . Some trends : <p> The baby-safety industry continues to grow . Some products are important - car seats , cabinet locks , gates - but some appear to be a bit much . Witness Cart Smartz , a liner for " public shopping carts to protect children against bacteria , germs , pesticides and extreme weather . " <p> Combination products are common . In addition to the popular car seat/stroller ( called a " travel system " ) , you can also get a stroller/backpack or a swing/high chair . Buying a combination product may save you from buying two separate items , but some travel systems are big and bulky and could end up being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasyland . One manufacturer of juvenile furniture won a 1999 JPMA competition for its Castle Bed , complete with towers and tents . Another featured product is shaped like a teddy bear . But think before you spend a lot ( suggested retail for the Castle Bed is $799 ) on a bed that will be used only until your child grows out of it or grows tired of sleeping in Sherwood Forest or the mouth of a wild animal . <p> For more on strollers , see our report " Merrily we stroll along . " Champagne 2000 <p> Caught up in the fizz around the millennium , several champagne and sparkling-wine makers have created a special cuvee , or blend , just for the occasion . Our expert tasters tried three of the new cuvees , which are all California sparkling wines made by the " methode champenoise . " Compared with their 20th-century brandmates from our November 1999 report , all are priced at a premium . But none is obviously higher in quality . Details : <p> Mumm Napa 21st Century Cuvee , $30 and probably available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very good Mumm Cuvee Napa Brut Prestige , $16 . Both wines have a crisp finish but could use a little more pizzazz . <p> Chandon Napa County Cuvee 2000 , $24 and expected to be available through February , seemed to have slightly more yeasty bouquet and complexity than the Chandon Brut Cuvee , $16 - but that may not be worth an extra $8 . The original Chandon ( now labeled Brut Classic ) was on the bland side overall , with a trace of a " Juicy Fruit " aroma ; our experts judged it good . <p> Korbel Sonoma County Champagne Commemorative Cuvee , $18 and available only until around February , is similar in quality to Korbel California Champagne Brut , $11 , which our experts judged to be good . The millennium model is slightly pink . Its overall aroma is candylike with a trace of tropical fruit or fruit cocktail . The original Korbel , sweeter than most of the brut champagnes we tested , had a slight yeasty bouquet and a trace of a pinelike aroma . <p> None of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are , in Ratings order : Piper-Heidsieck Champagne , Brut , $28 ; Moet &; Chandon Brut Imperial Champagne , $35 ; Mumm Cordon Rouge Champagne , Brut , $27 ; Taittinger La Francaise Champagne , Brut , $35 ; Domaine Carneros by Taittinger , Brut 1993 ( and the comparable 1994 and 1995 vintages ) , $20 ; and Moet et Chandon a Epernay Cuvee Dom Perignon Champagne 1992 , $115 . News about satellite and local TV <p> Since we published our December 1999 report on satellite television , legislation has passed Congress that would make it easier for satellite-TV providers to offer local channels - and fill a notable gap in their service . But do n't rush to buy a dish for local programming just yet . The bill - which was signed by the president as we went to press - does n't ensure that satellite service will permanently ( or affordably ) provide local service to all subscribers . <p> The legislation does eliminate rules that confined satellite companies carrying local channels to offering those services only to TV viewers who could n't get decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer local channels to any subscriber on request . <p> However , it 's unclear just what local service will be offered by providers in the long run . Initially , local service was expected to be provide only for major network affiliates in the biggest cities . The legislation requires any provider that offers some local stations to offer all stations in a broadcast market no later than 2002 . But how much subscribers will eventually pay for local service is undetermined . Satellite providers may have to pay more for local retransmission rights than cable companies do ; a bid to require that they pay the same amount was dropped from the bill . <p> Instead , satellite providers will have six months from when the bill is passed to negotiate fees with broadcasters - fees that will presumably be passed along to consumers . If the two parties do n't reach a deal , there 's even the risk of local satellite service being withdrawn eventually . The upshot for consumers ? Do n't buy a dish setup only because you expect to get local channels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the local service that satellites will provide , and at what cost . Home dry(er) cleaning <p> Dryel , from Proctor &; Gamble , promises to clean and freshen dry-clean-only , hand-washable , and special-care garments in the comfort of your home laundry room . In October 1998 , when it was available only in test markets , we said Dryel was no match for a professional dry cleaner , though it did a fairly good job of removing odors . We got similar results from a competing product , the Custom Cleaner Home Dry Cleaning Kit . Since then , Dryel has gone national , amidst a large advertising campaign , and Custom Cleaner has been bought by a joint venture of The Dial Corp . and Henkel . <p> Dryel has improved quite a bit . As before , it does a bang-up job of deodorizing . But now it also comes with useful instructions about removing water spots following treatment , which was a problem the last time we tested . It was also much better overall at removing stains from silk and wool fabrics . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman told us the product was being reformulated this winter . ) <p> To test for odor removal , we left a cotton sweater , a silk blouse , and wool slacks in a company smoking room for four hours , then ran the clothes through the dryer with Dryel . We did the same with garments that we hung above frying onions for more than an hour . In each case we could detect none of the offensive odors in the Dryel-cleaned garments , though there was a strong perfume scent from Dryel itself . That scent dissipated after a day . <p> To test stain removal , we used eyedroppers and measuring spoons to apply beef gravy , coffee , lipstick , red wine , salad dressing , spaghetti sauce , and tomato sauce to the sweater , blouse , and slacks . A half-hour later we pretreated the stains with the stain remover in the Dryel kit , then ran the clothes through the dryer . Dryel worked well on the spaghetti-sauce spots , but it left at least a light stain of the red wine on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse and slacks but remained on the cotton sweater . <p> Before/After <p> Dryel may not be the " revolution " it claims to be . But if you want to freshen up a lightly soiled garment or remove smoke or stale cooking odors , it can save you money and protect you from exposure to strong dry-cleaning solvents . ( A Dryel kit , enough to clean four loads , costs $10 . A refill , for six loads , costs the same . ) It also works well on some stains , including spaghetti sauce . As for convenience , while Dryel may save you a trip to the dry cleaner , in some cases you have to spend time pretreating stains and removing water spots afterward . <p> As we finished our testing , we heard that Proctor &; Gamble would be selling a reformulated Dryel in March . New ( and some improved ) catalog web sites . <p> As part of our November 1999 report on online shopping , we rated the web sites of 25 catalogs that sell clothing , food , gadgets , housewares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dynamic , we are continually updating our findings on our web site , www.ConsumerReports.org . <p> The story in November marked the CR Online debut of e-Ratings of all types of shopping sites , which now also include books and music , toys , electronic gear , and small appliances . Evaluations are supplemented by data on shopper experiences from BizRate.com , which rates e-businesses by polling consumers who have made purchases at the sites . <p> Our e-Ratings are based on a web site 's policies ( how clear and prominent are its security precautions and shipping costs , and whether customer information is shared with other marketers ) , ease of use ( how efficient it is to navigate the site and make a purchase ) , and content ( the completeness of product information ) . <p> We 've also changed our evaluation of four of the catalogs in our November report . Intimate-apparel merchant Frederick 's of Hollywood has increased its online selection , but the site continues to lack features , such as the ability to set up a personal account , that take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use and is now a web site worth trying . Victoria 's Secret is easier to use than before , but you still ca n't use the search feature unless you have a catalog-item number . We continue to recommend the catalog over the web site . The mail-order food merchant Harry and David has gotten easier to use and has increased its product offerings . But as we were about to submit credit-card information to make a purchase , a security-alert box warned us that the connection was not secure . We will revisit the site and will change our evaluation when we find this problem has been fixed .

The new cereal is a good source of fiber and would have been in the next-to-best group of cereals we evaluated nutritionally for our October 1999 report - a higher ranking than regular Special K. It also provides something that no top-selling cereal has : 60 percent of the daily value for calcium . <p> Trained tasters tried Special K Plus and found that when dry , the flakes were crisp , the fruit was moist , and the cereal was quite sweet overall . After the cereal sat in milk for two minutes , however , panelists found that it left a chalky feeling in the mouth , probably due to the large amount of added calcium . <p> Try it if you like flake-fruit-nut cereal and want to boost your calcium intake .

Zap insurance : Surge suppressors <p> Product Test <p> Computers , fax machines , and other home-office hardware should be protected from electrical slings and arrows . A nearby lightning strike can generate a brief but significant electrical surge of thousands of volts - enough to cause an array of computer problems , from a keyboard lockup to damaged internal components . <p> Electrical surges are n't rare , freak occurrences . Brownouts , blackouts , and other electrical noise all contribute to erratic electrical-supply voltages that can occur hundreds of times a year . A surge suppressor can help minimize the risk of electrical damage by redirecting the energy surge away from your vulnerable equipment . <p> We last tested surge suppressors in November 1994 . The 20 current-generation models tested for this report are power strips , the most popular type , with six to nine electrical outlets and a power cord that plugs into a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' safety standard UL 1449 . However , UL does not evaluate if a surge suppressor actually protects connected equipment . We did . HOW THEY PERFORMED <p> To determine how typical home-office equipment would fare , we exposed several unprotected computers to various surges and noted at what point they failed . We then connected a Pentium II test computer to each suppressor and fed it a variety of 2,000- to 6,000-volt disturbances . The better models protected our computer during more than 1,000 different surge tests . <p> In initial tests with lower-energy surges , all the suppressors protected the computer . But in our more difficult tests , some samples of the six bottom-rated models did n't protect the computer when the jolts reached 4,000 volts . <p> You ca n't always spot a well-designed suppressor from the outside . But a panel of our engineers did find real differences when they looked inside . The best had rugged circuitry and used a variety of components - capacitors , inductors , and multiple metal-oxide varistors ( MOVs ) - to absorb voltage spikes . The simplest suppressors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to tell the difference by listing the internal components or providing a cutaway drawing of the innards . <p> All the suppressors we tested come with lights to indicate if previous spikes have compromised the protection . But we found that those lights were n't always accurate . <p> Better models are generously designed , leaving enough space between outlets so the transformer at the end of some accessory power cords wo n't cover adjacent outlets . If you regularly use the surge suppressor 's on/off switch , consider a model with unswitched outlets ( to keep power to some equipment ) and an on/off switch opposite the cord end ( for less wire clutter on your desk ) . Most models also provide at least one telephone jack to shield the phone line from surges . We did n't test that feature . <p> ZAP ! POP ! We used a surge generator to simulate high-voltage surges , then monitored whether a hooked-up computer was protected and how well the surge was dissipated <p> RECOMMENDATIONS <p> All the surge suppressors we tested protected our computer under limited conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best choice is one of the top 14 models . They all withstood hundreds of surges ranging up to 6,000 volts . <p> If you live in a lightning-prone area , look to the top-rated Tripp Lite Isotel 6 Ultra , $70 . It was one of the best at suppressing the voltages in our tests and received a top design score from our experts . Also highly rated were the APC SurgeStation Pro 8T2 , $50 , and the APC SurgeArrest Pro 7T , $35 . <p> All is not lost if you ca n't find one of the suppressors we tested . When you 're shopping for a suppressor , check the package to see if it has a UL 1449 rating at 330 volts ( a higher voltage may not be as good ) . And look for a drawing or photo showing what 's inside : Better products typically contain a variety of components , such as inductors , capacitors , multiple MOVs , and fuses . <p> Most suppressors come with a warranty for the " lifetime of the product " that often includes a substantial-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't rely too heavily on such warranties ; you 'll be able to collect on a loss only if you can show that the surge suppressor failed to prevent it . Even with a top-of-the-line surges suppressor protecting a home computer , it 's a good idea to make frequent backups of important files . Also , because MOVs have a finite life and you ca n't know how many surges they 've absorbed , replace your surge protector when you buy a new computer , if not more often . RATINGS .
