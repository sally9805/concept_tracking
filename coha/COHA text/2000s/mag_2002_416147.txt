Book Excerpt <p> " Drug-resistant bacteria represent one of the greatest threats to our species , " says ethnobotanist Mark Plotkin , president of the Amazon Conservation Team , which works with people in the Amazon region to conserve forests and culture . Coauthor Michael Shnayerson , a contributing editor at Vanity Fair , agrees . " People have no idea what bacterial dangers await them when they go to a hospital , " he says . In a new book Killers Within : The Deadly Rise of Drug-Resistant Bacteria , Shnayerson and Plotkin report medical researchers ' evidence that the number of disease-causing bacteria able to fend off the most commonly prescribed antibiotics has grown significantly . We live in a " grim new era " of superbugs , say the authors , who cite scientific studies suggesting that we have only ourselves to blame . Physicians who prescribe antibiotics when the medications are not necessary , patients who do n't complete antibiotic treatments , and ranchers who overuse antibiotics to spur livestock growth have all contributed to the development of extra-hardy bacteria strains  --  a microbial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill you makes you stronger .

The Komodo was at least eight feet long and weighed well over 200 pounds . It looked like a dinosaur , Fredeking thought , it really did . It was almost all scales , with a huge mouth of large , curved teeth . One second it was lying in wait , all but invisible . The next , it was ripping out the terrified goat 's stomach with a single bite . As it did , thick saliva dripped from the dragon 's mouth , mixing with the blood and guts of the goat . Ah , yes , the saliva , thought Fredeking as he and his colleagues advanced from the bushes , tremulously holding long forked sticks . The saliva was why they were here . <p> With luck , the dragon 's viscous , revolting drool would contain a natural antibiotic that in some synthesized form could fight multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , which causes sometimes fatal blood poisoning , and other bacterial pathogens . At the least , Fredeking , a genial , stocky , self-styled Indiana Jones from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and possibly coin tribute to the fascinating new field of animal peptides . It sure beat collecting bat spit in Mexico and harvesting giant Amazonian leeches in French Guiana . <p> This latest approach to antibiotic discovery traced in large part to a well-ordered lab at the National Institutes of Health . On a fragrant , early summer day in June 1986 , a mild-mannered M.D. and research scientist named Michael Zasloff had noticed something decidedly odd about his African clawed frogs . As chief of human genetics at a branch of the NIH , Zasloff was studying the frogs ' eggs to see what they could teach him about the flow of genetic information from the nucleus of a cell to the cytoplasm . He would inject genes into the eggs , then see what happened . The frogs just happened to have large , good eggs for this purpose ; their own biology was irrelevant to his work . <p> Some lab scientists killed the frogs after cutting them open to remove their eggs . Not Zasloff . He would stitch them up crudely  --  he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them accumulated in a murky tank in his lab , he would secretly take them to a nearby stream and let them go . On this particular day , Zasloff noticed that the tank appeared to have " something bad " in it , because several frogs had died overnight and were putrefying . But some of the frogs he 'd operated on , sutured and thrown back into the tank appeared fine . Why was that ? Certainly the frogs ' stitches were not tight enough to prevent bacteria and other microbes from infiltrating their bloodstreams . Yet no infection occurred . No inflammation , either . <p> This was , as Zasloff put it later , his " eureka " moment , for even as he asked himself the question , he intuited the answer : the surviving frogs must have generated some substance that afforded them natural antibiotic protection . ( Zasloff never did figure out why the dead frogs had n't done the same , but he suspected that their immune systems had been too compromised to help save them . ) No likely suspects appeared under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin and isolating its elements . After two months , he still could n't see what he was after . He could identify it , however , by its activity . He was dealing with two kinds of short amino acid chains called peptides  --  like proteins , but smaller . Scientists knew that peptides participated in many metabolic functions of living organisms , either as hormones or other compounds . They did n't know what Zasloff had just realized : that some peptides in frogs worked as antibiotics . Zasloff named them magainins  --  the Hebrew word for " shields "  --  and theorized that they might lead to a whole new class of human-use antibiotics . So promising was Zaslows finding that when it was published a year later , the New York Times devoted an editorial to it , comparing Zasloft to Alexander Fleming , the British discoverer of the antibiotic properties of a fungus called Pencillium . " If only part of their laboratory promise is fulfilled , " the Times opined of his peptides , " Dr. Zasloff will have produced a fine successor to penicillin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery through serendipity . It was a means about to become quaint . Soon genomics would begin to transform drug discovery into a high-speed , systematic search with state-of-the-art tools that analyzed bacterial DNA  --  the very antithesis of serendipity . But targeting individual genes , by definition , would yield narrow-spectrum drugs . No doctor wanted to rely exclusively on narrow-spectrum drugs , especially in the hours before a patient 's culture was analyzed at the lab . Besides , a drug designed to hit one bacterial gene might soon provoke a target-changing mutation . Whole new kinds of broad-spectrum antibiotics were needed , too , and the best of those seemed less likely to be found by genomics than by eureka moments like Fleming 's and Zasloff 's , when a different approach presented itself as suddenly and clearly as a door opening into a new room . To date , virtually all antibiotics with any basis in nature had been found in soil bacteria or fungi . The prospect of human antibiotics from an animal substance suggested a very large room indeed . <p> The world had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penicillium fungus , then basically forgot about it for more than a decade . Now biotech venture capitalists scanned the medical journals for finds that might be the next billion-dollar molecule . Zasloff would find himself swept from his NIH lab into the chairmanship of a new public company with Wall Street money and Wall Street expectations , his magainins hyped as the Next New Thing . Nearly $100 million later , he would also be the tragic hero of a cautionary tale about the challenges a maverick faced in bringing new antibiotics to market . <p> As he monitored their action , Zasloff discovered that the peptides he called magainins act not by targeting a bacterial protein , as nearly all modern antibiotics do , but by punching their way through the bacterial cell 's membrane and forming ion channels that let water and other substances flow in . These , in turn , burst the bacterium . This bursting or lysing occurred because the magainins were positively charged and the bacteria had negatively charged elements called phospholipids on their membrane walls . The positively charged peptides homed in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell . <p> The wall-punching mechanism suggested that peptides might be especially useful against resistant bacteria . The proteins targeted by nearly all existing antibiotics could be changed or replaced . For a bacterium to change its whole membrane would be orders of magnitude more difficult . It seemed impossible . And as far as Zasloff could see , peptides were drawn only to bacterial cell walls  --  never , in vitro at least , to the membranes of normal human cells . Which made them a perfect antibiotic . <p> Another NIH scientist might have published his findings , as Zasloff did , and gone back to tinkering in his lab with the next intellectual challenge . But as a pediatrician , remembering babies with cystic fibrosis , Zasloff wanted to see peptides turned into drugs right away . His first step was to call the Food and Drug Administration . " I 'm from the NIH and I just made a discovery that 's about to be published , " he told the bureaucrat he reached . " Can I get someone from the FDA to help me do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug ? " The FDA had no system , it turned out , to help government researchers develop drugs while keeping their government jobs . Nor did the NIH have any such guidelines . ( Not long after , the agency would allow researchers to profit in modest ways from technology transfer , but the burgeoning biotech industry would be filled with NIH refugees wanting a larger share of the proceeds of their discoveries . ) <p> Zasloff risked being fired or sued , he discovered , simply for fielding the calls that began to pour in after his article was published . If he talked to Merck , he could be sued by Bristol-Myers , because he was a government official obligated to favor no company over another . <p> A call from venture capitalist Wally Steinberg decided his future . Steinberg offered Zasloff a deal that allowed him to help with the start-up  --  to be called Magainin  --  to teach , and to continue to practice as a pediatrician . In short order , Zasloff became a professor of genetics and pediatrics , in an endowed chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetics at Philadelphia 's Children 's Hospital . For Magainin , set up outside Philadelphia in a corporate park of former farm town Plymouth Meeting , he worked as a part-time consultant . <p> It should have been an ideal setup , a dream life guaranteed to make any medical researcher sick with envy . But while Zasloff had thought he could work on peptides in his hospital lab and pass the results on to Magainin , the hospital 's directors thought not . Work funded by the hospital , they declared , ought to remain the hospital 's intellectual property . When the university , the third leg of Zasloff 's new career , began lobbying for its own share of the proceeds , Zasloff gave up . Heartsick , he resigned a directorship at the hospital , and gave back the endowed chair to the university . As of 1992 , he would gamble his entire career on Magainin . <p> Since peptides seemed to work against almost anything , Zasloff and his colleagues scanned the market for a condition treated by only one drug : less competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin infection characterized by rashlike lesions , and caused by skin bacteria , usually certain streptococci or S. aureus . If the peptides worked as well or better than Bactroban , the existing treatment , they 'd be approved . From there , Magainin could go on to test peptides against more serious topical infections , have a couple of profit-making products on the market , and so gird up for serious bloodstream infections . <p> The peptides sailed through phase one trials : applied to healthy human skin , they caused no harm . In phase two , they seemed to produce good results on 45 people who actually had impetigo . The Bactroban trials had involved a placebo : simple soap and water . Magainin followed suit . But when the results of the phase three trials were compiled in mid-1993 , Zasloff was stunned . Though the peptides had done as well as Bactroban , neither product had done as well as soap and water ! How , then , had Bactroban won approval in the first place ? Zasloff never learned . The FDA merely announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Magainin 's stock plunged from $18 to $3 a share . As Magainin teetered on the verge of collapse , Zasloff pulled a rabbit out of his hat . Or rather , a dogfish shark . <p> By 1993 , inspired by Zasloff 's original paper , dozens of other scientists had gone in search of peptides in other animals . They 'd found them just about everywhere they 'd looked  --  70 different antibiotic peptides in all  --  in everything from insects to cows to Komodo dragons . Intriguingly , different creatures secreted peptides from different kinds of cells . Many insects made them in their white blood cells . In horseshoe crabs , they appeared in the blood elements called platelets . In the frog , as Zasloff had determined , they appeared in a part of the nervous system called the granular glands : the frog empties these glands , Zasloff found , when the animal is stressed , or when the skin is torn . As for humans , they turned out to harbor peptides of their own : in white blood cells , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain cells of the airway called the ciliated epithelium . Perhaps , thought Zasloff , some other animal 's peptides would make a more potent antibiotic than those of the African clawed frog  --  potent enough to bring investors scurrying back to Magainin . <p> One day Zasloff gave his standard stump talk about peptides to a group of scientists at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Mount Desert , Maine . John Forrest , a professor at Yale University 's medical school , raised his hand to say that he 'd spent 19 summers studying the dogfish shark , and , by God , if the African clawed frog had peptides , so must the shark . The shark had long been Forrest 's experimental animal model , as the frog was Zasloff 's . Small and hardy , the shark had large , simple cells and organs that made it easy to study . Best of all , when Forrest operated on a dogfish shark , he could suture it up and toss it back in a tank of dirty water , as Zasloff did with his frogs . Inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shark stomach expecting to find peptides . Instead , he found a new kind of steroid with even stronger antibacterial action  --  yet another element of the innate immune system . He called it squalamine . " Hey ! " he told Forrest by phone . " Send me more of those shark stomachs ! " <p> Eventually , Zasloff found a way to purify shark squalamine , and switched to livers , because a ' commercial fishery called Seatrade in New Hampshire could Federal Express him half a ton of them a week . Zasloff himself would wheel the heavy boxes of stinking shark organs in from the loading dock , then start slinging them into a giant meat grinder . The purification process involved heating the ground livers in garbage cans like great vats of soup , skimming the squalamine-rich scum from the top , then filtering the scum through a high-tech set of steps . <p> Along with squalamines , Zasloff found other steroids in the purified gunk . He figured there were more than 12 kinds in all . Each had broad antibiotic effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell in the shark 's body . Publication of the discovery of squalamines had brought calls from around the world , and these helped focus Zaslows study . Several of the steroids worked as anticancer agents both in dogfish sharks and in humans . One kind even prevented lymphocytes from carrying out the AIDS virus ' orders to make more virus . <p> Certain that he had found a way to save his company , Zasloff contacted Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH and , as such , the top U.S. government official involved in fighting AIDS . Fauci established a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement , or CRADA , with Magainin , and Zasloff started injecting squalamines into AIDS-infected mice and dogs and monkeys . The squalamines worked brilliantly  --  up to a point . They stopped the growth of the lymphocytes , just as they had in laboratory experiments . Unfortunately , as soon as the treated animals were hit with the squalamines , they stopped eating and began to lose weight . <p> For months , Zasloff struggled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver , he spent his days skimming scum and injecting steroids into AIDS-infected lab animals . No approach worked . The animals ' lymphocytes stopped growing , as did the AIDS virus , but the animals simply would not eat . Anthony Fauci gave up hope : the prospect of halting a patient 's AIDS infection while having him die of starvation was obviously unacceptable . <p> Okay , Zasloff declared at last , Okay . All was not lost . " What nature has given us , " he announced to his devastated colleagues , " is an appetite suppressant . " <p> ZASLOFF HAD TWO STRIKES AGAINST HIM , and as far as his backers were concerned , it was the bottom of the ninth . But by the mid-1990s , the sharp rise in resistance around the globe had cast peptides , his other finding , in a more favorable light . Peptides still appeared utterly impervious to all the new mechanisms of resistance that bacteria had employed . Intrigued , the FDA offered to let Magainin try peptides once more , this time on a more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FDA knew , the existing antibiotics used against these painful foot lesions caused such debilitating side effects that patients usually stopped taking them  --  even though the lesions , when infected , tended to invade muscle and bone , and even led to amputation of the affected limb . Now , in addition , resistance to these antibiotics was rising . Worse , the most promising of them , Trovan , would soon be pulled from the market for causing liver toxicity . Here was a real need  --  and market niche  --  that peptides seemed perfect to fill . <p> Because patients could suffer irreversible harm from diabetic ulcers , the FDA ruled that no placebo would be needed . Zasloff 's peptides merely had to do as well or better than one of the comparators , a powerful antibiotic called ofloxacin , which came not as a topical ointment but in oral form . Magainin breezed through phase one trials : the peptides , as shown in the previous trials , caused no harm to the skin of healthy people . To speed the process , the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients were recruited from more than 50 medical centers in the United States between 1995 and 1998 . These were very sick patients , their lesions excruciatingly painful . When doctors swabbed the lesions with a peptide solution , most of the patients seemed to improve . <p> As Zasloff pored over the final results , he felt encouraged , if not wildly optimistic . The topical peptides had not quite outperformed oral ofloxacin , but they 'd done nearly as well . Certainly the tests had shown that MSI-78 , as Magainin 's latest peptide was known , had a broad and powerful spectrum , did not provoke resistance , and had no direct side effects . The results were strong enough for SmithKline Beecham to sign on as a partner . SKB would market the product as Locilex . Now all Magainin needed was formal approval by an FDA advisory panel . <p> The panel , comprised of seven experts from various fields , met on March 4 , 1999 , in Silver Spring , Maryland , to spend the whole day debating the merits of Locilex . Zasloff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning session went well , but the afternoon was a different story . <p> Perhaps the panel members were served an inedible lunch . Perhaps the meeting room was too hot or cold . Whatever the reason , the members reconvened in a grumpy mood . One of the seven declared that in her opinion-founded not on clinical experience , only on the morning 's 30-minute tutorial  --  no antibiotics were needed for infected diabetic ulcers . " Just cut the infected tissue out and throw it in the garbage can , " she declared . One after another of the members agreed . The panel 's chairman , Dr. William Craig , pointedly disagreed . Nevertheless , the vote was 7-5 not to approve the drug , a decision upheld formally by the FDA some months later . Michael Zasloff 's 13-year crusade to use peptides against drug-resistant bacteria was finished . <p> Over the next two years , Zasloff himself came to wonder if animal peptides would ever work in people . Perhaps the way to go was to focus on human peptides  --  plenty of those had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innate immunity to fight human infections . <p> In a desperate bid to keep his company alive , Zasloff pushed squalaminc into clinical trials as an appetite suppressant . He was serious . It was the Haft Mary play , as he put it , that might save the day . But no one else seemed to believe he could pull it off . <p> In the fall of 2000 , Zasloff 's own directors lost faith . The scientist whose discovery had inspired the company was made a consultant  --  pushed out , as Zasloff later admitted  --  and the corporate direction changed . The clinical tests with squalamine as an appetite suppressant were carried on : the stuff did look promising , wacky as the route to its application may have been . Early results had shown squalamine to be effective , as well , against ovarian and non-small-cell lung cancer . But in corporate press releases , no further mention was made of antibiotics  --  or peptides . From now on , the company would use genomics to find new targets and new natural substances like hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Magainin was changed to Genaera . <p> In his more contemplative moments , Zasloff admitted he 'd made mistakes . But he had no regrets about his role in establishing a burgeoning new field : some 3,000 articles on peptides had been written since his seminal paper of 1987 , some 500 peptides discovered . The innate immune system was now part of science . And for Zasloff , the most promising aspect of peptides was still their potency against resistant bacteria . They 'd persisted through most , if not all , of evolutionary history . In all that time , bacteria had never become resistant to them . Was it too much to suggest that they constituted the Achilles ' heel of pathogens ? That bacteria never would become resistant to peptides ? " They 've had a billion years to fend these things off , " Zasloff said , " and this is what we 've got . " <p> AS THE PRESIDENT OF ANTIBODY SYSTEMS , a small , Texas-based biotech company , Terry Fredeking had dedicated himself to the search for peptides and other natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might lead to drugs for resistant pathogens . Michael Zasloff 's discovery had made his work possible ; one of Zasloff 's former students was in his employ . Some of his samples  --  which included parasites from Tasmanian devils , among other odd things  --  showed promise in vitro , but Fredeking hungered for more . In truth , he was a bit of a showboater , eager to make his name , with the sort of chutzpah that made lab scientists shudder but sometimes got things done . " There 's got to be something bigger than this , " he said one day to one of his consultants , George Stewart , professor of parasitology and immunology at the University of Texas . " What can we do next that 's dangerous , exciting and will advance science ? " <p> " How about Komodo dragons ? " Stewart suggested . <p> " Komodo dragons ? " Fredeking echoed . " What in the heck are they ? " <p> Stewart explained that the world 's largest lizard , formally known as Varanus komodoensis , was justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fearless enough to prey on human beings on a somewhat regular basis . In fact , humans were by no means its largest prey : full-grown Komodos were known to bring down 2,000-pound water buffalo . Found only on the Indonesian islands of Komodo , Flores and Rinca , the dragons were descendants of mososaurs , massive aquatic reptiles that roamed the seas 100 million years ago . Though the Komodo dragon did often hunt down and devour its prey , it also had a craftier method of killing that hinted at the presence of antibiotic peptides . A stealth hunter , the dragon lay in wait for sambar deer , crab-eating macaque monkeys and other mammals of its habitat , then lunged for the abdomen of its passing , prey with toothy jaws as strong as a crocodile 's . Almost always , its wounded victims escaped , because the dragons , many of them heavier than a fat , six-foot-tall man , could run only in short bursts . But because the dragons Often feasted on rotting carcasses , their jaws teemed with virulent bacteria . Within 72 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would die of bloodstream infections brought on by these bacteria . Eventually the dragon would come lumbering over to take his meal at last . <p> Both because of its lethal saliva , and because the dragon ate carrion teeming with more bacteria , zoologists had long wondered what made the dragons immune to all these pathogens . Whatever it was had to be really powerful , because of an evolutionary oddity about the dragon 's teeth . Razor-sharp as they were , and serrated like a shark 's , the dragon 's teeth were actually covered by its gums . When it snapped its jaws shut on its prey , the teeth cut through the gums . The dragon 's lethal saliva , then , had access to its bloodstream . Yet the Komodo remained uninfected . <p> " In all likelihood , " Stewart finished , " the dragon 's bacteria has been battling with its immune system for millions of years , with both sides getting stronger and stronger over time to keep each other in balance . " <p> " That 's it ! " Fredeking exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years passed before Fredeking and two colleagues could secure permits to take samples of Komodo dragon saliva . Both the Indonesian and the U.S. governments had to be petitioned , because the dragon is an endangered species , and most of the 6,000 animals that remain are found within Komodo National Park , which covers several islands and is now a World Heritage Site . Finally , on November 3o , 1995 , came the momentous day . Fredeking and Jon Arnett , curator of reptiles at the Cincinnati Zoo , flew to Bali , where they met up with Dr. Putra Sastruwan , a biology professor and Komodo dragon specialist at the University of Udayiana in Bali . They took two days to recover from jet lag , then flew to the Indonesian island of Flores in a small Fokker plane that made Fredeking more nervous than the prospect of facing Komodo dragons . <p> The next day they crossed over to Komodo by ferry-another unnerving experience for Fredeking , since the ferry had sunk on several occasions . From a distance , the island appeared shrouded in fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its coastline was lined with rocky headlands and sandy bays . Much of its interior was dry , rolling savanna , with bamboo forests halfway up the larger peaks . The island supported a variety of large mammals , all imported by man : deer , water buffalo , boar , macaque monkey and wild horse . No one knew how the Komodo dragons had come to the island . Paleontologists believed their genus evolved in Asia 25 million to 50 million years ago as reptiles , then migrated to Australia when those two land masses collided . Because Indonesia lay closer to Australia at that time , the dragons may have swum to the islands and proliferated , growing larger over time , because the islands contained no predators for them . <p> Hot and sweaty , the biologists spent their first night on the island in a village that was nothing more than a cluster of bamboo huts . Over a local dinner of rice and fish , they heard stories of the dragons ' ferocity . Eight villagers , mostly children , had been attacked and killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established and records began to be kept . One old man had paused beside a trail to take a nap : his supine form looked vulnerable and inviting , and he , too , fell victim to a dragon 's steel-trap jaws . Other stories , unverifiable , had circulated ever since W. Douglas Burden came over in 1926 on behalf of the American Museum of Natural History and made a first formal study of the beasts , capturing 27 of them and naming them Komodo dragons . Burden also brought the first Komodo dragon back to New York City . He told the story of his adventure to Meriam C. Cooper , among many others , and fired the Hollywood producer 's imagination . Cooper changed the dragon to an ape , added Fay Wray , and in 1913 gave the world King Kong . <p> It was the next morning that Fredeking saw a Komodo dragon rip open the belly of a terrified goat . He had briefly considered bringing tranquilizer guns to bag his prey , but scotched the idea when he learned that a sedated dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so cannibalistic that they will eat each other , including their own young . Newly hatched dragons know , by biological imperative , to scamper immediately up tall trees and spend their first two years as arboreal creatures , safe from the snapping jaws of their parents below . <p> Instead of using sedatives , Fredeking and his cohorts emerged from their hiding places with long forked sticks and one long pole designed for catching crocodiles : an extendable pole with a wide noose at the end . The noose was slipped over the dragon 's head and pulled tight . Before the befuddled creature could react , six men jumped on him . The Cincinnati Zoo 's Jon Arnett held the dragon 's head and began wrapping duct tape around it . Others wrapped tape around its extended claws . Equally important , a ranger grabbed the dragon 's powerful tail . Fredeking reached for the long Q-Tips he 'd brought for swabbing at the dragon 's saliva . He looked at the dragon 's furious eyes and , then , startled at its third eye : a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which acts as a light-sensing organ . He dabbed at the saliva , shocked at how thick and viscous it was  --  like Vaseline . One sample was slipped into a vial , then another . Fredeking began to feel euphoric . That was when he heard one of the others say , in real terror , " Oh my God . " <p> Fredeking looked up and felt the paralyzing fear of the hunter who has gone from being predator to prey . More than a dozen Komodo dragons were advancing from all sides . Drawn by the noisy struggle of the dragon that had been captured , the lizards had converged with the quaintly Komodian hope of eating it  --  along with the men around it . Panting with adrenaline , the men pushed at the dragons with their forked sticks . With their length , body mass and sheer reptilian power , the dragons easily could have pushed right up to the men and started chomping away , either at the duct-taped dragon or at the hors d'oeuvres plate of tasty human legs . But the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the park guards  --  an old hand at dealing with the dragons  --  aggressively advanced on one of the larger lizards , and pushed him away with his forked stick . For a tense minute or so , the outcome remained uncertain . Then , one by one , the dragons turned and clumped away . Fredeking took a long breath . " Man , oh man , " he said . " What we do for science . " <p> On that first trip , both of Fredeking 's cohorts incurred deep scratches on the insides of their calves by sitting on the dragon 's back to help restrain him . They knew that the dragon 's scaly skin  --  as scaly as chain mail  --  was rife with bacteria too . Within hours , they were infected and running , fevers . Fredeking was running a fever too . All three took Ciprofloxacin and soon felt better . Not surprisingly , the dragon 's bacteria were susceptible , given that the bugs had probably never encountered commercial antibiotics . <p> Along with saliva swabs , Fredeking came away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in Thermos-like containers , the samples were flown back to Texas , where Fredeking 's researchers got to work . They counted 62 different kinds of bacteria in Komodo saliva . The most potent of the lot was Pasteurella multicida , common in many domestic animals , though in far less virulent strains . They found antibiotic peptides , too , along with a small molecule that did an even better job of killing bacteria . In vitro , the molecule knocked out three of the worst bacterial pathogens : methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) , vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus ( VRE ) , and E. coli 0157:H7 or Escherichia coll . Don Gillespie , a veterinarian in touch with Fredeking because of his work with Komodos at the Nashville , Tennessee , zoo , worried that the peptides might not last long in the human body . But this new small molecule , he thought , might not be recognized by human antibodies , and so be a perfect candidate for a new class of antibiotic . <p> First , the researchers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mice , then guinea pigs , then primates . And even the gung ho Fredeking knew better than to make any predictions . " If it makes mice grow long green tails and crave human flesh , we 'll know it 's not good , " he said .
