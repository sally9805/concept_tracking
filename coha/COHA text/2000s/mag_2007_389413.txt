Do we need a middle ground ? Something between the grind of executive life and the quiet burble of the nap that precedes the long sleep ? AH ME , WHAT TO DO . On the one hand , I 'm getting too old for this stuff . The daily battle entices me less and less . I dream of beaches , palm trees waving in the wind . I gravitate to books about space travel and biographies of people who gave it all up for an existence in the South of France , say , or the South Sea Islands . In meetings , I find I ca n't listen to meaningless drivel anymore without wanting to get up and leave . That 's a significant liability . PowerPoint presentations in particular put me into a sleep so deep it involves drooling . The smallest things irritate me way too much , also . I 'm up every night at 3 A.M. wondering why I 'm up every night at 3 A.M. No matter how small the potential snafu or fubar situation , it rears up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . I 've been at this 25 years . I may need to retire . On the other hand , I see people who have retired before they were physically unable to work anymore , and frankly , they give me the willies . All those healthy , fit men with suntans and golf clubs and white , toothy grins that you will see elsewhere in this issue , I am sure . Brrrr . Who are those guys ? I see them in the places I eat . They 're in the back by the potted plants . They 're talking about mashies and niblicks and great lies on the 15th fairway . When you ask them what it 's like to be retired , they talk about golf , and they talk about all the organized travel they are doing , and in my mind 's eye the void opens up like a cosmic space that only Stephen Hawking could understand , a place where people mall-walk in fugue states . I 'm scared to retire . That way lies senescence , superfluity , and too much thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something between the grinding labor of executive life and the quiet burble of the nap that precedes the long sleep . The good news is that I believe , after cogitating for some time on the subject , that I have discovered the answer : retirement while employed . Anyone who has achieved a certain ripeness of years and is still in harness is eligible . The key , I believe , is to use the digital capabilities , global reach , and executive lifestyle as we now live it to in a sense achieve all the best things about retirement without actually having to suffer its dangers and indignities . Let 's imagine a typical day in the life of the employed retiree : RISE WITH THE SUN We get up early , as do seemingly all who have quit the daily rat race . It 's like when we were kids . It was impossible to wake on school days , but on Saturdays we were up with the worms to watch cartoons . That 's what we can do again . As the sun peeps over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , full of pep and vinegar . Do a few stretches , lope into the kitchen for that first glass of grapefruit juice and handful of medications that are now required to keep us vertical , mobile , and tranquil . We 're ready for a new , nonstressful , productively retiring day ! BE " AT BREAKFAST " UNTIL AT LEAST 10 A.M. We can do this because we 're executives and have attained a certain ability to be in no particular place whatsoever . In fact , this is an asset in the eyes of most senior management structures . " Where 's Horst ? " somebody will say , and will be told , " At a breakfast with a client or something . " My , what a hardworking mogul is Horst ! This elasticity of space and time is one of the great benefits of late-stage employment . The development of digital ubiquity , while in general being a massive pain in the sphincter , also allows the seasoned BlackBerry aficionado to be nowhere and everywhere at the same time . This stretches and blurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As all who have shuffled off the corporate coil find it advisable to do , we walk to a leisurely breakfast at our local diner , bagel place , or coffee shop . There we enjoy a massive cup of joe while reading the daily newspaper with some care , saving the obituaries for last , since they are the most enjoyable for people of our experience and years . Yes , we glance at our BlackBerry every now and then just to make sure no explosions are happening  --  and this is the best part of all . Real retired people must look forward to a total day of nugatory impact . We have some action to look forward to ! Not too much . But some . And if there 's a crisis to deal with that halts our morning ritual , so much the better . It will be all the sweeter tomorrow . After having dealt with crucial phone calls and e-mails on our daily constitutional to the office , we arrive at our desk to find a number of vital issues awaiting . Our retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have teeth and little barbed tails that can whip around and take your eye out . DELEGATE ALL ODIOUS TASKS Fortunately , we have prepared for our status well and have long ago implemented a strategy by which we foist objectionable duties onto other people . This is the keystone of our program and must be highly effective if our pseudo-retirement is not to falter . There 's a huge difference between being a happily employed and perked-up retiree of high standing and a washed-out , lazy has-been who does n't get his work done . The good news is that we have Ted , Ned , Betty , and Fred to do all the heavy lifting . Ted does the numbers stuff . Ned is really good at internal communications and heavy , process-related e-mailing . Betty , of course , takes all the long meetings , the ones that lock us up , make us feel like a prisoner in the gulag , negate any of the retirement benefits we have been gathering . And Fred ? Well , Fred does everything . God bless Fred . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , because he will need it . MENTOR THE YOUNG But we digress , as all of us who are playing the back nine like to do . The reason that Ted , Ned , Betty , and Fred are equipped to perform in this manner is because you have implemented the next part of your strategy : You continue , every day , in any way you can , to teach the young to pick up the mantle of those who have gone before . Which of us now chilling our jets in the cosmic Admirals ' Club does n't enjoy hanging with the next generation of leaders ? That 's what we do , sometime during our scaled-down day . We get with them . We give them wisdom . They seem a little bored with our war stories sometimes , sure . But there are nuggets that they pick up , both positive and negative , that will help smooth their way into the big , comfy chairs we 've occupied for so long . AVOID ALL ODIOUS PEOPLE In addition to providing us with a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mentees enable us to accomplish the next phase of our task , avoiding the people we dislike . One of the big responsibilities of a business career in mid-stride is the requirement to see guys who laugh too much , shake our hands too hard , sell stuff we do n't want or need , and otherwise get into our faces until they 're about to fall off . Our faces , I mean . Not them . They never fall off . Being gainfully retired means never having to deal with these people unless we choose to . ENJOY A LONG LUNCH So while Ted and Ned and Betty and Fred deal with Mr. Roover , who is looking into outsourcing certain key corporate functions in which we have no interest , we 're going to move to the next part of our day : a pleasant , prolonged lunch . Genuinely retired people , of course , have as long a lunch as they want , but the experience is likely to be depressing . How are we , who have enjoyed tasty , elegant expense-account lunches for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on whole-wheat toast , taken sitting in our kitchen while looking at a small flat-screen television that is constantly tuned to CNBC ? For a year , perhaps , it might be nice . After that ? They shoot horses , do n't they ? But just think of all the great things we can enjoy in our blessed state ! Plump burgers with mountains of fries ! Thick , juicy steaks ! Sushi-quality tuna over leafy greens ! After our main course , we stick around the table for a while , savoring our coffee and the little cookies that are one of our fondest indulgences . Then we perambulate back to the office for the central event in the day of any retired wage slave , actual or virtual : our afternoon nap . KNIT UP THE RAVELL 'D SLEAVE OF CARE The nap is a big responsibility , not to be shirked . We are not , as some may think , goofing off when we put our feet up on our desk or flop on our executive couch and close our eyes . We are refreshing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macbeth noted , sleep is " sore labor 's bath , balm of hurt minds , great nature 's second course , chief nourisher in life 's feast . " Who wants to argue with Shakespeare ? Not us . We need our nap if this working retirement is to be a success . Ours is not the attenuated Q-sign with tongue sticking out of the corner of our open mouths that the guys in Happy Fairway enjoy . We 're taking a bona fide power nap . Ten minutes . Fifteen , maybe . Twenty , tops . Then , when the phone rings , or there 's a knock on the door , we 're up on our feet and back behind our blotter , ready for Teddy , Neddy , Betty , and Freddy . MISS NO BOONDOGGLE But what about that desk ? That blotter ? We did n't " retire " in order to stay cooped up in our offices all day , did we ? Pas du tout ! In fact , this is the very best part of the deal we 're carving out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , connected to our home ports by every digital gizmo known to humankind ! On the off chance that we 're actually needed for a meeting , there are teleconference capabilities everywhere on the planet ! We 're so elevated and successful we have no need for analog participation in quotidian existence whatsoever ! So as part of our plan , we 're going to travel to lovely locations where the company has operations that can explain our presence , while at the same time making sure to miss no conference or offsite , no matter how remote its venue . Hey , I know guys who have been to Las Vegas six times already this year . In September a whole bunch of us are going to the South of France for an absolutely mandatory convention . Other destinations that would make perfect business sense include London , San Francisco , Los Angeles , Miami , and Denver , the latter only in the late winter or early spring . Get the picture ? What dynamic , bold executive with a hearty agenda does n't need to get to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or to the meeting of all industry vendors in Chicago ? Or indeed to Pebble Beach now and then , where the CFO likes to have meetings about belt-tightening ? How many golf courses are there in the world where business types are hanging around chinnin ' and grinnin ' right now ? Are most of them retired in anything but spirit ? I think not . TAKE BACK THE NIGHT As our assistant plans our travel schedule and the afternoon wanes to dusk , we may want to call our spouse to set up our plans for the evening . Things have actually been going quite well for us as a couple these days . To begin with , we 're a lot more relaxed than we used to be , almost as if the weight of the world had been lifted from our shoulders . This has made us more pleasant , emotionally available , and yes , amorous . Our late mornings have given us an extra hour or so to be together , so much nicer than in the days when we were up at 5:30 A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our teeth . Now , as the moon rises over the park , we stroll home and think about everything but business . Tonight , after perhaps a cocktail , we will be going out with some friends who just flew in from the coast . They 're happily and virtually retired in Los Angeles , where guys in show business learned how to do this long ago . In the end , friends , the success or failure of this enterprise resides with ourselves . We 're as young as we feel and as old as we look . We 've been doing things our way for quite some time . There 's no reason to change the game that got us here , is there ? STANLEY BING 's new book , Crazy Bosses ( Collins ) , is available at finer bookstores everywhere .
