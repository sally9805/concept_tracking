WITH AS MUCH DRAMA AS A SCIENCE-FICTION TALE , THIS REAL-LIFE ADVENTURE TAKES EAGLE SCOUT NEIL ARMSTRONG ALL THE WAY TO THE MOON ( AND BACK ! ) . Photograph // Maybe Neil Armstrong was just born to fly . He took his first plane ride at age 6 . By 9 he was building model airplanes , and at 14 he was doing odd jobs around his hometown of Wapakoneta , Ohio , to earn the price of flying lessons . Sure , he had other interests , as any kid would . Armstrong played the baritone horn in his high school band . ( " We were n't very good , " he says . " We played The Star-Spangled Banner ' and were so bad that only half the people stood up . " ) He also joined the Boy Scouts and earned his Eagle Scout Award . But his main interest was always flying . When he got his student pilot 's license on his 16th birthday , Aug. 5 , 1946 , he had no idea just how far his love for flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way to the moon . Photograph // The Long Road Begins Hoping to become an aeronautical engineer , Armstrong won a U.S. Navy scholarship that paid his way to Purdue University in Indiana . Midway through his second year , the Navy ordered him to report for flight training . Before he won his wings , the Korean War broke out . Armstrong spent the next two years flying fighter jets off the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Essex . Seventy-eight combat missions later , he came home a genuine war hero , earning an Air Medal with two gold stars , then completed his studies at Purdue . For the next few years , Armstrong worked as a civilian test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California . After flying jets and rocket planes , he became convinced that space travel-long a fantasy of science-fiction writers-would soon become a reality . When the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-NASA-was established in 1958 , he signed on as a research pilot . Four years later , he became an astronaut. // ' We 're Tumbling End Over End ' NASA had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit of Earth . Now it was launching its most ambitious project yet : sending a man to the moon . Armstrong and his fellow astronauts spent long hours learning how to operate the complicated systems on a spacecraft . They also flew test missions to make sure there were no glitches in the equipment and procedures . Armstrong was the command pilot on one of these missions , Gemini 8 . His assignment was to connect an orbiting spacecraft to an Agena rocket that was also in orbit . The maneuver , called docking , would be a crucial step in a lunar landing . Armstrong had no trouble docking with the Agena . But a few minutes later , the joined vehicles started to spin , slowly at first and then much faster . He undocked from the Agena but the spinning continued . " We consider this problem serious , " he reported to Mission Control . " We 're tumbling end over end . " After several extremely tense minutes , Armstrong realized he had to abort the mission . He and his co-pilot dropped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 was the most harrowing of the Gemini missions , but it was not a failure . Neil Armstrong had shown that docking worked . He had also shown that he could keep cool in an emergency . When the moon mission , Apollo 11 , was finally ready to go , Armstrong was a logical choice for flight commander . Seconds before the signal for liftoff , the huge rocket 's first-stage engines started to rumble . It quickly grew into a full-fledged roar . Saturn V thundered off the launch pad , and within minutes , Neil Armstrong and his flight crew of Michael Collins and Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin ( both graduates of the United States Military Academy ) had been propelled 36 miles into the air . At that point , the Saturn Vs first-stage engines shut down . The first stage dropped away and the second-stage engines kicked in . They sent the rocket orbiting around Earth at a speed of more than 17,000 miles per hour . After one and a half orbits , the third-stage rocket fired , increasing the speed to 25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apollo 11 broke away from the gravitational pull of Earth and streaked toward the moon . Three days after lift-off , Apollo 11 's command module , Columbia , fired a rocket that sent the astronauts into lunar orbit-their spacecraft was now traveling on a path around the moon more than 60 miles above its surface . Twenty-four hours later , Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took their places at the controls of the lunar module , Eagle . The module had been extracted from the third-stage rocket and docked onto Columbia shortly before the third-stage rocket burned away . Michael Collins undocked the lunar module , and Armstrong activated the systems that extended its legs and locked its landing gear . The rocket engine fired , and Eagle , looking like a huge mechanical bug , began its descent to the moon . When Eagle was about 1,000 feet from the moon 's surface , Neil Armstrong peered out the window and saw that the automatic throttle was steering them into a field full of gigantic boulders . If they landed there , Eagle might be seriously damaged . Seizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several minutes later , he spotted a safer spot and prepared to land . Back in Houston , the officials in Mission Control were tracking Apollo 11 and holding their breaths every step of the way . They were particularly anxious when Armstrong decided to change his landing site . The extra minutes were using up precious fuel . Finally Armstrong 's voice came crackling over the radio with the words Mission Control had been waiting to hear : " The Eagle has landed . " Everyone at the Manned Spacecraft Center breathed a sigh of relief . Armstrong had touched down with only 30 seconds ' worth of fuel left in his tanks . Photograph // ' One Small Step for Man ' It took the astronauts a long time to put on the bulky backpacks they had to wear over their space suits . These PLSSs-Portable Life Support Systems-contained a complicated assortment of tubes and equipment to keep them cool in the intense heat of the lunar surface and enable them to breathe in its airless atmosphere .

Eastern time on July 20 , Neil Armstrong climbed down Eagle 's ladder and stepped onto the powdery surface of the moon . As more than half a billion people around the world watched on live television , Armstrong made his historic statement , " That 's one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . " Twenty minutes later , Buzz Aldrin joined Armstrong on the moon . The two astronauts took photographs , collected samples of rocks and moon dust , and conducted scientific tests . Before returning to Eagle , they planted an American flag and left behind a plaque that read : HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT ON THE MOON JULY 1969 , A.D. WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND . A Hero ? Me ? In the early hours of the morning , Armstrong and Aldrin climbed back into Eagle and closed its hatch . After a short rest , Armstrong fired the rocket that lifted Eagle off the moon . It ascended on a tower of flame and docked with Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while awaiting their return . Armstrong and Aldrin loaded their equipment and specimens into Columbia , undocked Eagle and let it crash to the moon . Another rocket fired and Columbia broke away from the gravitational pull of the moon and went whizzing back to Earth . On July 24 , Neil Armstrong , Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins splashed down in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii . They were picked up by a helicopter and flown to the aircraft carrier Hornet , where President Richard M. Nixon was waiting to greet them . Neil Armstrong received many awards for his feat , including the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom . When the excitement died down , he went back to work for NASA sharing what he had learned for the space missions that would follow . Although he is often referred to as a hero , Neil Armstrong 's description of himself is far more modest : " I am , and ever will be , a white socks , pocket protector nerdy engineer .

Neil Armstrong did n't have a chance to earn the Space Exploration merit badge en route to his Eagle Scout Award . The badge was n't created until 1965 , after Armstrong 's career that eventually landed him on the moon had already begun . But you can earn it . You 'll learn the history of space exploration and discover what space travel has taught us about the moon and the planets . You 'll even get to build , launch and recover your own model rocket .
