A labor economist sees peril as a tiny minority of the population accumulates more and more wealth . Photograph // A century ago , battles against what angry Americans called plutocracy-rule by the rich-raged all across the United States . Those battles would eventually leave the world 's first mass middle class by the 1950s . Today , that plutocracy is back and that middle class is hurting . What about tomorrow ? In the twenty-first century , will Americans continue to tolerate enormous disparities in the property people own and the wealth individuals have accumulated ? In the United States currently , the most-affluent 1% of the population holds more wealth than the entire bottom 90% combined , according to U.S. Federal Reserve research . The most-honored captains of industry-Fortune 500 CEOs-routinely make more in a morning than their average employees earn in a year . Will our grandchildren live amid similar disparities ? That future , most contemporary analysts would agree , seems likely .

A maximum-wage tax on the super-rich seems unlikely to harm the wealthy since most of their income comes from property assets rather than labor . Children in Bangladesh bathe in a polluted lake . Societies in which the income gap is dramatically wide are less healthy than more-equal societies , says author Pizzigati. // Indeed , Americans have yet to begin the debate regarding just how concentrated wealth has become . In the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign , President George W. Bush made no apologies for his tax cuts that , in 2004 alone , meant an extra $170,000 for average taxpayers in the nation 's most-affluent 1% . His challenger , John Kerry , did call for a rollback on tax cuts benefiting this top 1% , but he declined to challenge the existing distribution of income and wealth , a distribution more unequal than any seen in the United States since before the Great Depression . Kerry 's stance raised no eyebrows , perhaps because no politician today considers grand accumulations of private wealth as any sort of pressing problem . " I think it 's less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about how much middle-class and working people have , " Howard Dean said during his 2004 presidential bid . " The thing to do is concentrate on the 90% of people who do n't have what they need and make sure they have it , and not worry about the people who make $500,000 a year . Of course , it 's obscene , but so what ? " Fighting Economic " Obscenity " A century ago , most U.S. citizens who considered that they had a social conscience saw their advocacy for a better society as essentially a two-front struggle . A good and honorable republic would only emerge , they believed , if more wealth accumulated at the bottom of the social order , less at the top . Wise nations , James Madison had argued years earlier , seek to " reduce extreme wealth towards a state of mediocrity , and raise extreme indigence towards a state of comfort . " Advocates for social justice a hundred years ago shared Madison 's perspective . Their task appeared straightforward . They needed to " level up " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty . They preached this egalitarian imperative at every opportunity-and round massive audiences for their message . Just how massive can be illustrated by examining public response to Edward Bellamy 's best-selling 1888 novel , Looking Backward , which tells the tale of an affluent Bostonian who falls asleep in 1887 and awakes in 2000 to a United States without a wealthy elite . In the new nation Bellamy describes , all working people earn the same income but work varying numbers of hours . Workers bid for jobs , and the market sets the hours of work for each job category . If no one bids for a particularly unappealing job , the hours required for that job are reduced until the job becomes appealing enough to attract bidders . In Bellamy 's Utopia , workers with the least-appealing jobs only have to labor a few hours a week . In the 1890s , clubs soon sprang up around the nation to popularize the Looking Backward credo . The book 's readers , dirt-poor populist farmers and middle-class reformers alike , thrilled to Bellamy 's vision for an egalitarian future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1861 , only a handful of millionaire fortunes dotted the American landscape . By 1900 , more than 4,000 fortunes had reached seven figures . Never before in U.S. history had so few become so rich so fast . One leading magnate spent $5 million erecting a mansion on Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue , then found he had n't left enough space for flower beds . He promptly had the brownstone next door demolished and replaced with a $400,000 garden . Meanwhile , elsewhere in Manhattan , half the city 's people lived in tenement neighborhoods that averaged close to a thousand people per acre . Men and women inspired by visionaries like Bellamy would not accept this gross inequality . They battled to slice the wealthy down to democratic size through checks on trusts-the grand accumulations of companies that created even grander accumulations of personal wealth-and taxes on the incomes and the estates of the wealthy . These men and women were more right than they knew . The research of a veritable brigade of present-day analysts-economists , environmentalists , and epidemiologists-predicts a dark future indeed if policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing gap between the wealthiest citizens and everyone else . Over recent decades , these analysts have generated an often brilliant body of work that explores just what happens when modern societies let themselves grow substantially more unequal . Economists have put to test the most cherished chestnut of apologists for concentrated wealth , the claim that complex , modern market societies have no choice but to accept inequality . Any steps taken to reduce inequality , this claim holds , will inevitably reduce market efficiency-and leave societies less able to create new wealth for everyone . In reality , recent researchers have documented that societies tolerating inequality do not grow faster economically than more-equal societies . Princeton economist Roland Benabou counted more than a dozen " cross-country empirical analyses " that demonstrated a " negative effect of inequality on growth . " Clearly , noted another analysis prepared for the Federal Reserve , " the older view , that greater inequality is associated with faster growth , is not supported by the data . " Environmental researchers , meanwhile , have been documenting how growing inequality is speeding the exhaustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorb the wastes of the increasingly wasteful consumer culture . On a grotesquely unequal globe , these environmentalists point out , the desperation of those without wealth and power-and the greed of those with it-is despoiling the natural world . We see this desperation-and despoliation-wherever wealth concentrates . In Guatemala and El Salvador , the wealthiest 2% of the population owns more than 60% of available arable land , notes environmental analyst Tom Athanasiou . Should we be surprised , he asks , when landless peasants in outrageously unequal nations like these " migrate into rain forests or onto fragile uplands " to find land to farm ? But the greatest strains on the earth 's carrying capacity come not from developing nations , but from the already developed . Those living in the richest 20% of the world 's nations use 17 times more energy than the bottom 20% , UN researchers report . The United States alone produces nearly a quarter of the world 's greenhouse gases . These contrasts shock , but they do not tell the whole story . Indeed , the gaps between nations may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacle may well be the gaps within nations , between the rich and everyone else . These gaps-wider today in the United States than in any other developed nation-accelerate consumption and waste , as growing fortunes ratchet up the level of acquisitions that define the good life . The wider these gaps , the deeper we stamp footprints into the earth . **26;3309;TOOLONG who study the health of populations-have an even more alarming story to tell : The more unequal a country is , the less healthy its people are . People with modest incomes in relatively equal societies can actually look forward to longer , healthier lives than people with higher incomes who live in more unequal societies . The nation with the developed world 's lowest level of income inequality , Japan , currently boasts the world 's highest life expectancy-and this despite atrociously high levels of cigarette smoking among Japanese men . The much more unequal United States , despite spending as much on health care as the rest of the world combined , sits twenty-seventh in current world life-span rankings . " In the developed world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , but the most egalitarian , " says British epidemiologist Richard Wilkinson . This epidemiological research on inequality has had no impact on mainstream political discourse in the United States yet . Nor have any of the findings of equality-minded economists and environmentalists . And the political debates that figure to roil the United States during the next few years-debates over Social security and the federal tax system-are n't likely to move the nation in a more equal direction either . In both the Social security and tax debates , the choice before the American people is between the current top-heavy status quo and a proposal for change that would , if adopted , leave the nation 's wealth more unequally distributed , not less . Should There Be A Maximum Wage ? Fortunately , all these current political realities do n't necessarily doom us to continued inequality . If we look beyond today 's political mainstream into the political margins , we can see a debate beginning to take shape over how much inequality a sane society should tolerate . This debate seems to be revolving around what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and income : the explosive growth of corporate executive compensation . Top business executives a generation ago could not possibly have imagined how fortunate their successors would turn out to be . In 1975 , Reginald Jones , then CEO of General Electric and widely regarded as the nation 's most talented executive , took home $500,000 , a sum that equaled 36 times the income of that year 's typical U.S. family . A quarter century later , in 2000 , General Electric CEO Jack Welsh took home $144.5 million , a sum equal to 3,500 times the typical family income for that year . In 2004 , Yahoo CEO Terry Semel cleared $231 million in the year 's first 10 months alone . Windfalls like these are prompting calls for radical action from within the business community , most notably from Richard C. Breeden , the former chairman of the U.S. securities and Exchange Commission , the agency that regulates Wall Street . In 2002 , a federal judge appointed Breeden to come up with a fix-it plan for WorldCom , the scandal-ridden , bankrupt telecom giant . Breeden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavish structure of executive pay incentives -a structure , Breeden charged , that had encouraged a reckless pursuit of wealth . Breeden 's solution was to put a lid on total compensation from all sources for the top executive at MCI , the company that emerged out of WorldCom 's ashes . Breeden fixed this maximum dollar amount at not more than $15 million a year , though the MCI board , he added quickly , would be free to set a lower number . Breeden had established , in effect , the first " maximum wage " in U.S. corporate history . Breeden 's maximum did n't win many headlines . But his advocacy for an explicit limit on executive pay did remind some observers that the United States once abounded with distinguished national leaders ready and willing to seriously discuss and debate proposals that would cap the incomes of its very richest citizens . In 1942 , a call for what amounted to a maximum wage actually came from U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt , who asked Congress to impose a 100% tax on all individual income above $25,000-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt did n't get his 100% top tax rate , but he did get Congress to pass a 94% top tax rate on all income more than $200,000 . The top tax rate on high incomes would hover around 90% for the next two decades , when the incomes of the average U.S. family would double-and when the share of the nation 's income going to the richest 1% would drop by more than half .

This bag contains only socially conscious products , for celebrities who prefer their swag to be healthy , eco-friendly , and nonexploitive. // Those high tax rates on high incomes that Roosevelt inspired have long since disappeared . In 1943 , America 's very richest , according to U.S. Internal Revenue Service statistics , paid 78% of their total incomes in federal income tax . In 2003 , by contrast , they paid a mere 17.5% of their total incomes in federal tax . And Roosevelt 's notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no advocates for a moreequal United States see a maximum wage as a realistic possibility anytime soon . But some advocates do see a potential for more modest proposals that would shove the United States in a maximum-wage direction . Minnesota Congressman Martin Sabo , for instance , has introduced legislation in Congress that , if enacted , would prohibit corporations from deducting from their tax bills any executive compensation that totals more than 25 times the pay of their lowest-paid workers . A similar proposal surfaced a few years ago in Connecticut . That initiative would have denied state government contracts to any corporations that pay executives more than 25 times what their workers receive . Elsewhere in the developed world , where rising levels of executive pay have generated considerably more public outrage than they have in the United States , proposals for outright income caps have started to gain some political traction . For example , the former leader of Germany 's largest political party is now suggesting that compensation at Germany 's CEO summits be limited to 20 or 30 times the pay that average workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brazil , are customized for drivers afraid of being kidnapped or falling victim to violent crime directed against the rich . // Ideas along this line might , of course , never catch on in the United States . We might continue down the road to greater inequality in the decades ahead . And if so , what would life be like in a still moreunequal United States ? We need only look to Brazil to find the answer . Brazil currently boasts the overall greatest gaps in wealth and income in the world . In Brazil , the richest 10% make nearly 50 times what the poorest 10% make-more than twice the gap between top and bottom tenths that currently exists in the United States . Amid this stark inequality , Brazilians are spending $2 billion a year on private security . In Sao Paulo , a third of local residents employ private guards . People in Sao Paulo have good reason to be nervous . According to news reports , kidnappings have become so common that some plastic surgeons now " specialize in treating wealthy victims who return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other missing body parts that were sent to family members as threats for ransom payment . " Meanwhile , in Brazil 's second-largest city , Rio de Janeiro , carjackings were taking place so often in the late 1990s that police officials assured affluent drivers that they could run red lights on dark streets without facing any fines . Thousands of those drivers took no chances . They armored their cars , typically at $35,000 per automobile . " Soon the haves will circulate throughout the city in personal tanks , " Sao Paulo novelist Ignacio de Loyola Brandao predicted right before the century turned . That prediction would turn out to be somewhat off base . Brazil 's wealthy took to the air , not tanks . Sao Paulo now sports 24 times more helipads than New York City , and Sao Paulo businessmen routinely ride helicopters to work , commuting , the Washington Post reports , " from their fortified offices to their fortified homes . " Could this be America 's future ? Could the growing numbers of gated communities in the United States morph into Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more equal , stable , healthy future . Maximum of 10 Times Minimum ? Back in the 1940s , Roosevelt found himself unable to assemble a winning coalition behind his proposal to levy a 100% tax on annual incomes greater than what today would be $300,000 . His allies likely saw this as a politically impractical declaration of war against the rich . But suppose Roosevelt had asked Congress to set a cap-a maximum allowable income-not as a fixed amount , but as a fixed multiple of the nation 's minimum wage , with any income above that multiple subject to a 100% tax . If this approach-an income ceiling tied to an income floor-had been proposed and adopted , the wealthy would have been able to increase their incomes even with a maximum wage in place . To realize this increase , the wealthy would have needed only to convince Congress to raise the minimum wage , because the higher the minimum , the higher the maximum . By advocating for the nation 's poorest workers , the wealthy would have advocated for themselves . Any move we might make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , of course , immediately raise a series of difficult questions . How wide a gap between top and bottom , maximum and minimum , makes sense ? How much income is enough ? How much is too much ? Philosophers over the millennia have pondered the question of how much is enough . In ancient Greece , Plato pronounced the ideal ratio between the wealth of the richest and the wealth of the poorest to be four to one . Aristotle deemed the ideal ratio five to one . Modern analysts have found that , within every developed country , about 97% of all income earners fall within a 10-to-l income ratio of each other . Let us assume for the moment that this 10-to-1 ratio makes sense as a set-point for an income limit . The maximum wage would then become 10 times the minimum wage . Any income more than 10 times the minimum wage would be taxed at a 100% rate . What would this mean in actual dollars and cents ? The U.S. federal minimum wage currently stands at $5.15 an hour , or $10,712 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each spouse earning the minimum wage , earns twice that , or $21,424 . If a " Ten Times Rule " were in effect , the maximum wage would be 10 times this annual minimum-$107,120 for single filers or $214,240 for couples filing jointly . For people with incomes below the maximum but above the minimum , the Ten Times Rule would key income-tax rates to the minimum wage , not just the tax rate applied to the wealthiest incomes . A maximum tied to a minimum , as noted , would give rich people a vested personal interest in raising the minimum wage and improving the well-being of the poorest people . Linking all tax rates to the minimum wage would give everyone else in society that same vested interest . In such a Ten-Times-Rule nation , taxpayers earning 10 times the minimum wage would pay 10% of their income in taxes . Taxpayers earning five times the minimum would pay a 5% tax . And if they made exactly the minimum wage , they would pay 1% of their income in taxes . How significant a fiscal impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incomes of the richest 1% of U.S. citizens averaged $1.082 million for the year . If the Ten Times Rule had been in effect in 2003 , these households would have paid a 10% tax on their first $214,240 and a 100% tax on all income above that . The total tax due would be $889,184 , an amount that would have equaled 82% of the average top 1% income , a rate only slightly higher than the actual 78% tax America 's wealthiest paid on their total incomes back in 1943 . The next richest 4% of households averaged $217,000 in 2003 , just a hair more than the $214,240 that would have been the 2003 maximum . In a Ten-Times-Rule nation , the average household in this tax bracket would have paid $24,184 in federal income tax , or 11% of their total incomes . In 2003 , the middle 20% of income earners averaged $36,600 per household , less than twice the income for a minimum-wage couple . Under the Ten Times Rule , middle-bracket taxpayers would have paid federal income taxes at just a 1% rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2003 , all U.S. households would have paid fewer dollars in federal taxes than they actually did-all except the richest 1% . In fact , average families would have seen their taxes cut by almost threefourths , and families making around $200,000 would have seen their taxes cut by more than a third . Furthermore , despite these cuts , the Internal Revenue Service would still have collected more total income-tax revenue , because the increase in tax collections from the nation 's richest 1% would offset the decrease in revenues from the bottom 99% by about $450 billion . The 1RS , of course , would have only been able to collect those extra billions if the rich continued earning income above the Ten Times maximum after the Ten Times Rule went into effect . But why would anyone wealthy continue working to earn income that would be completely taxed away ? No rational person is going to labor for dollars that go only to a tax collector . But the highest incomes do n't come from labor . The highest incomes come overwhelmingly from the ownership of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their fortunes . In 2000 , for instance , people who made $1 million or more averaged only 33% of their incomes from wages and salaries . Most of their incomes came from other sources , everything from interest and dividends to capital gains . Income from labor can be turned off , like water out of a spigot , but income from wealth never stops flowing . In a Ten-Times-Rule nation , wealthy people angry about paying taxes at a 100% rate could certainly choose to stop working . But they could not stop their wealth from working . That wealth would continue to generate income . And that income , above the Ten Times maximum , would be taxed at a 100% rate . Could any of this Ten-Times-Rule scenario ever materialize ? That may hardly seem likely in the current political environment . But environments change , and U.S. society could , too , as more Americans begin to understand how outrageously high levels of inequality hurt all people-rich , poor , and everyone in between .
