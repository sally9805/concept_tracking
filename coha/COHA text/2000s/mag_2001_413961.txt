If shopping were an Olympic event , I would win the gold medal-partly because I 've spent so much time in stores picking outfits for television stars to wear . but mostly because I simply adore the process . Being an expert shopper of sorts , I 've also learned how to spot true bargains . If you follow my sneaky shopping strategies , you can shave hundreds of dollars a year off your fashion budget . Happy savings ! by Christine Schwab 3 ways to avoid bad buys 1 . Keep a pad and pencil in your closet . When you are dressing and think , If only I had an eggplant-colored cardigan , jot it down . Need herringbone nylons ? Make a note of it . This becomes your shopping list , which will help you steer clear of impulse purchases . 2 . Never shop when you 're depressed . Chances are , you 'll grab clothing that 's out of your price range or style repertoire just to make yourself feel better . 3 . Also stay at home when you 're hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rush just to get your shopping done . Sale-spatting secrets Climate almost always dictates what goes on sale . If it 's a warm winter , items like cashmere sweaters , woolen scarves , trousers , gloves , and boots will go on sale in mid-December ( with prices hitting rock bottom at the end of January ) . If it 's cold , wait until the next month for prices to drop . Be wary of giant winter " blowout " sales . Often they 're full of rejects ( items other shoppers have consistently passed up because of cut , color , or fabric ) . If you see only one or two of a particular garment , it 's a good sign-probably meaning that all the others like it were purchased at the original price . Budget-stretching strategies Do n't buy something just because it 's on sale . If you do n't need or adore it , it 's not a bargin-just money wasted . Ask yourself if you 'll like the piece in years to come . The more it costs , the longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes together . Separates are more useful when you buy them in colors that match . ( See Heather Locklear , above left . ) Do n't forget about alterations . A sale item that needs extensive alterations is not necessarily a bargain . Invest the largest part of your budget in classic pieces and spend what 's left on trendier items . A leather trench ( see Paulina Porizkova , above right ) will outlast a flashy cardigan ( see Cyndi Lauper , below left ) or animal-print clothing ( see Gwen Stefani , below right ) , THE RIGHT BOOTS Photograph // FOR EVERY OUTFIT Boots are a style staple this season . Here , what to wear with any pair . Ankle boots : Try these with tights in the same shade and a slim skirt that sits an inch or two above your knees for a leg-lengthening ( and very hip ) look . Low calf boots : Sport these with straight slacksthe boots are tall enough that their zippers wo n't snag on the hem , but short enough that they wo n't bulk up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter-weight capris to give them a modern twist . No leg should be exposed . Knee-high boots : Don these with a flowy A-line skirt for a sophisticated work ensemble . MUST-HAVE : the tie-neck top If you buy just one top this month , make it one with a tie neck . This sexy detail is showing up on scads of shirt styles ( casual , button-down , sheer , sleeveless ) and nixes the need for accessories . Best of all , you can tailor this trend to your taste : Try knotting the ties loosely at the base of your neck , simply let them dangle , or for extra flair , toss one end over the opposite shoulder .
