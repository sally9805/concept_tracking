Orion updated the traditional 8-inch reflector and made it perfect for the 21st century . // Whether it 's clothing , hair , or musical groups , styles come and go . What 's " hot " today may be " not " tomorrow , only to be back in style next year . Although not as fickle as fashion , the telescope market also swings like a pendulum . In the 1960s , nearly every dedicated amateur astronomer owned either a 6-inch or 8-inch Newtonian reflector on a German equatorial mount . These instruments delivered high-quality views of sky objects both near and far . Then along came the 1970s , and Newtonians fell out of style in favor of catadioptric telescopes . The 1970s faded into the 1980s , which brought " aperture fever " as the Dobsonian craze tempted amateurs with huge , double-digit-aperture Newtonian reflectors on basic wooden mounts . The 1990s saw catadioptrics sharing the market with refractors ( themselves back from the 1960s ) as well as Dobsonian-mounted Newtonians . But tried-and-true Newtonian reflectors on equatorial mounts were few and far between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ventured " back to the future " with the introduction of their SkyView Pro and Atlas lines of Newtonian reflectors . The latest is the Orion Atlas 8 , arguably the sturdiest equatorially mounted 8-inch Newtonian sold today . Like the equatorial Newtonians of yesteryear , the Atlas 8 can track the stars across the sky , letting the observer view targets for extended periods without having to nudge the telescope constantly . But make no mistake - this is n't your parents ' telescope ! Unlike the German equatorial mounts of the 1960s , the Orion Atlas mount includes the latest innovations , including DC-powered , dual-axis stepper motors , a hand controller , and an illuminated polar-alignment scope . It does share one thing with those mounts of yesteryear , however : The Atlas 8 is massive , tilting the scales at 96 pounds . Fortunately , an intelligent design eases the burden of transporting the telescope . Photograph THE 25MM AND 10MM EYEPIECES that come with the Atlas 8 yield magnifications of 40x and 100x , respectively . ASTRONOMY : WILLIAM ZUBACK // When you purchase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package ready for action right out of the box , thanks to a long list of included accessories : 10mm and 25mm Orion Sirius Plossl eyepieces , a 6x30 finder scope , a collimation eyecap , a camera adapter , and dust covers . All you 'll need to add is a star atlas and a supply of D-size batteries . Optics The Atlas 8 telescope 's steel tube assembly is built around an 8-inch f/4.9 primary mirror and a secondary mirror that measures 2.25 inches across its minor axis . Both are made of plate glass . Together , they create a fairly large ( 28 percent ) central obstruction . Unfortunately , that 's all but inevitable with such a fast focal ratio . The primary lies in a mirror cell that is fully open in the back to allow rapid cooling . The cell also has four threaded holes for mounting a small muffin fan ( such as Orion 's part number 07814 ) to help speed mirror cooling . The secondary mirror is set in place on a four-vane spider mount . Both mirror mounts are easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ' and 1 ' ' ' eyepieces , the latter with an included adapter . Focusing is relatively smooth , although I suggest you replace the sticky grease used as a lubricant with something a bit lighter . The Atlas focuser can be collimated , if needed . Three pairs of push-pull screws set around the focuser 's base can be loosened to adjust the focuser 's tilt . While this is a welcome feature , most purchasers would be best advised to leave well enough alone until they are fully confident with how to collimate the telescope 's optics . Mount alignment The Atlas mount is attractive , with a black powder-coat finish and fully internalized motors . A pair of large thumbscrews holds the telescope 's rotating-ring dovetail assembly securely to the mount 's saddle plate . The dovetail assembly can slide 6.5 inches fore and aft along the saddle plate for precise balancing . If you 're planning on doing guided astrophotography , then the telescope must be polar aligned accurately . To ease what can be a tedious job , the Atlas 8 mount includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look through the polar scope 's eyepiece to see a slide showing the Big Dipper , Little Dipper , and Cassiopeia . Rotate the telescope around the polar axis until the stars on the slide are superimposed on the stars in the sky , and the North Celestial Pole should be aligned with the small cross in the slide 's center . Because the alignment scope protrudes from the mount , always cover it with its threaded plastic cover when not in use . Photograph ORION 'S ATLAS 8 Newtonian reflector is a great-looking scope that rides on a heavy-duty German equatorial mount supported by a tubular steel tripod . ASTRONOMY : WILLIAM ZUBACK Photograph THE OPTICAL SYSTEM of Orion 's Atlas 8 shows the f/4.9 primary mirror at the base of the tube and the secondary mirror supported near the top . ASTRONOMY : WILLIAM ZUBACK // Although I found the polar-alignment scope handy , adjusting its illumination level is a little tricky . The adjustment knob measures only about 1/8-inch in diameter and barely sticks out of the housing . The knob was difficult to turn with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter knob would make adjustment both easier and more precise . The beefy Atlas mount is also a solid performer . Motions are smooth in both right ascension and declination , even in temperatures below freezing . With the 20.5-pound tube assembly and two 11pound counterweights , the mount remained reasonably steady in fairly strong wind gusts . Vibrations dampened in about 3 seconds after I rapped the side of the tube with the ball of my hand . The dual-axis drive tracked the sky accurately with no jumping or vibrating from the stepper motors , even when observing at 356x . The hand controller 's right ascension and declination responses are immediate , with the telescope starting and stopping the instant a button is pressed or released . I saw no evidence of backlash or dead spots in either drive axis . If I had to offer Orion one piece of advice regarding the Atlas 8 , it would be to fit the telescope with a larger finder scope . The 6x30 that comes with it is inadequate for serious star-hopping . I advise buyers to purchase either an 8x50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Atlas 8 will accept finder mounts sold by Orion and several other companies . Power and drives Power for the polar reticle as well as for the dual-axis drive motors comes from either a 12-volt DC source or from a 110volt AC source ( with a converter sold separately ) . Owners also can choose to power their telescope with a rechargeable cell or car battery . Eight D-cell batteries ( using the included battery holder ) powered the test telescope . Orion reports a set of batteries should let the scope track for about 60 hours , but my alkaline batteries powered the drive for more than 84 hours . Your numbers may vary , and lots of slewing certainly will shorten battery life . Pressing buttons on the hand controller sets the speed of the drive 's stepper motors . Slewing can coast along at either 8x or 16x the tracking rate , while fineguiding for astrophotos is set at 2x the tracking rate . Do n't confuse this telescope 's tracking with the automated go-to motions of other telescopes . The Atlas 8 has neither a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user to move it around the sky by hand . The Atlas 's tripod is a sturdy unit built on three 2-inch-diameter stainless steel legs . Each two-part leg extends between 33 and 58 inches in length using a quick-release clamp . A spreader , which includes a tray to hold three 1 ' ' ' eyepieces and three 2 ' ' ' eyepieces , screws into the underside of the mounting head and presses outward against the three legs to improve the mount 's overall rigidity . Cillimation and testing Orion ships the Atlas 8 in three well-padded boxes : one for the tube assembly , a second with the German equatorial mount , and a third containing the tripod . The instrument needed collimation on arrival . I collimated the Atlas 8 using Orion 's combination sight tube/Cheshire eyepiece tool ( sold separately ) . With the telescope set up and collimated , I set out to check optical quality by conducting a star test . Results proved the Atlas 8 has excellent mirrors . The star test showed optical quality exceeded - wave . Studying an out-of-focus star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Images showed only a slight bowing of the outer test lines , indicating an inconsequential trace of spherical aberration . Subsequent viewing proved these test results to be true , as images were sharp . With optical testing complete , I began my tour of the winter sky with the Orion Nebula ( M42 ) . The 52 apparent field of view of the 25mm eyepiece translates to a real field of view of just over 80 ' ' , more than enough to fit the entire sword of Orion . With M42 centered , the subtle glow of the reflection nebula NGC 1975 was faintly visible along the northern edge of the field , while Iota ( iota ) Orionis , the sword 's brightest star , was clearly visible to the south . Switching to the supplied 10mm eyepiece , the Trapezium easily resolved into four sharp points of bluish-white light . All views were memorable . My tour of the winter sky continued with stops at open clusters M36 , M37 , and M38 in Auriga , as well as M35 in Gemini , one of my favorites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Photograph THE HAND CONTROLLER for the Atlas 8 allows two slewing speeds , 8x and 16x the tracking rate , and a guiding speed 2x the tracking rate . ASTRONOMY : WILLIAM ZUBACK // The Pleiades is often cited as one of the sky 's finest star clusters for binoculars but not for telescopes due to their narrower field of view . The short focal length of the Atlas 8 , however , means all seven sisters , as well as a crowd of stellar cousins , can squeeze into the 25mm eyepiece 's field . The stars sparkled brilliantly but also revealed one of the down sides of a fast astronomical telescope : coma . The stars along the edge of the field were noticeably distended into tiny , comet-shaped blurs . Orion 's ads state the 39.2-inch ( 996mm ) focal length and 4.9 focal ratio mean the Atlas 8 is ideally proportioned for wide-field views of large deep-sky objects such as the Orion Nebula and the Andromeda Galaxy ( M31 ) . While this is true , do n't take it to mean the Atlas 8 wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I boosted the magnification to 356x ( using my 7mm Pentax XL eyepiece and 2.5x Tele Vue Powermate ) , the Atlas 8 provided a good view of Saturn 's subtle equatorial banding , the Cassini Division , and C ring , as well as details in Jupiter 's multi-colored atmosphere . Further , when it was turned toward some winter double stars , the Atlas 8 easily resolved Castor , Rigel , and several other pairings separated by only 1.5 ' ' ' ' . Local seeing conditions prevented me from splitting closer pairs . Beyond visual use Although my test of the Atlas 8 was primarily as a visual instrument , Orion touts its astrophotographic abilities as well . The universal camera adapter that comes with the telescope makes it possible to couple just about any digital or 35mm single-lens reflex camera directly to the focuser once you marry it to a camera-specific T-adapter , available at most camera stores . Regarding the drive , slight tracking errors always are present in a clock drive 's gear system . These so-called periodic errors occur with precise regularity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worm gear . Some high-end telescope mounts include periodic-error correction ( PEC ) circuits that eliminate the need for users to correct these errors themselves . The Atlas 8 does n't have a PEC circuit , but Orion sells an astrophotographic package that includes an 80mm refractor , 5mm illuminated reticle eye-piece , and mounting rings . If you 're looking for a lightweight instrument , the Atlas 8 is n't for you . No denying it , the Atlas mount takes quite a bit of effort to carry . And if you happen to be a gadget junky looking for computerized bells and whistles , this is not your telescope either . Better stick with other instruments that divide their strengths between optics and electronics . But if you 're looking for a telescope for visual observing that also will let you dabble in wide-field , guided astrophotography , then the Orion Atlas 8 should be on your short list of choices . Its impressive optical quality combined with the mechanical stability of its equatorial mount and the attractive price all make the Orion Atlas 8 a great instrument that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPECIFICATIONS Optical system : 8-inch f/4.9 Newtonian reflector Mount : German equatorial on adjustable tripod Accessories : * 6x30 finder scope * Rack-and-pinion focuser ( accepts 1 ' ' ' and 2 ' ' ' eyepieces ) * Illuminated polar-alignment scope * Dual-axis DC-powered clock drive with hand controller * 10mm and 25mm Plossl eyepieces * Camera adapter * Collimation cap * Dust caps Weight : * Optical tube assembly : 20.5 pounds * Equatorial head : 37.5 pounds * Counterweights : 11 pounds each ( two supplied ) * Tripod : 16 pounds Price : $1,099 Contact information : Orion Telescopes and Binoculars P.
