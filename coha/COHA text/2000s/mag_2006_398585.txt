Section : AMERICA 'S LARGEST PRIVATE COMPANIES Drug wholesaler Stewart Rahr has built up profitable $4 billion business . Now he can either sell it  --  or face a slowdown <p> Stewart Rahr interrupts a conversation with a visitor to take a call from former New York Knicks forward Charles Oakley . " Oak , sweetheart , I 'm going to Vegas this weekend , " barks the 60-year-old native of Brooklyn , N.Y . " Any chance you 're gon na be there ? " Brief conversation over , Rahr holds up a photo of himself standing next to Angelina Jolie , Meryl Streep and singer Wyclef Jean  --  one of hundreds of such pictures that adorns his office . " Does it look like they did n't want me there ? " he asks defiantly . The New York Post 's Page Six had reported that Rahr was kicked out of a Hamptons party for barging into such photo ops . Nonsense , he explains ; a bouncer had failed to recognize him . <p> Rahr has made a fortune not in Hollywood but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinray of Whitestone , N.Y . could earn , if you believe his boast , $50 million pretax on sales approaching $4 billion by keeping 3,000 corner pharmacies in seven states stocked with drugs , bandages and orthopedic shoes . Moving beyond his success as a merchant , he has involved himself in charitable causes ( such as Make-A-Wish Foundation ) that allow him to drop big names ( " my friend Billy Joel , " " my friend Michael Jordan " ) into casual conversation . The star-packed photos on the wall show a darkly tanned businessman whose mouth folds into a smile , but whose eyes look straight ahead , worried . <p> These are anxious times for Rahr . The nature of the business is changing  --  from the way pharmaceutical companies deal with wholesalers to the rise of mail-order pharmacies  --  and in a way that is not good for a company like Kinray . Rahr has some difficult choices ahead : either sell out or adopt a different strategy if the firm is to continue its double-digit growth . As for taking Kinray in a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of a younger leader . But Rahr has n't appointed a successor , and neither of his two kids wants any part of the company . A tough spot for someone who ought , at this point , to be enjoying the fruits of his hard work . <p> Kinray was doing $1 million a year in sales in 1969 , when Rahr dropped out of NYU 's law school to run the business with his father , Joseph . It was slow going . " I remember Charlie Cohen of Cohen 's Pharmacy telling me , ' Nothing for you today , ' and hanging up on me over and over again . " But Rahr had a knack for shrugging off rejection , and his persistence eventually brought orders , if only for a couple of bottles of aspirin . Kinray nudged ahead for two decades . It really took off in 1993 , after Rahr chatted up his airplane seatmate , an Austrian inventor who had developed a system that automatically processed combined orders and sent pills or diabetes kits onto conveyor belts for distribution . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in its warehouse . <p> Besides efficiency , Rahr offered his customers hand-holding . " We 're no different than anyone else , " says 19-year Kinray veteran Sandy A. Greco , executive vice president of purchasing and marketing . " It 's your service that really holds you second to none . " Greco says Kinray was constantly pitching new products , such as Breathe Right nasal strips and over-the-counter Zantac , printing circulars for the drug stores  --  even helping them reorganize their inventory . A one-store pharmacy could get Rahr on the phone . <p> In 1994 sales jumped 40% to $200 million , and Rahr moved from a 25,000-square-foot warehouse to a cavernous one that grew to 400,000 square feet . The added capacity helped him elbow out his competitors , which started dying off . In 2000 revenue passed the $1 billion mark . Not long after , Rahr 's son , Robert , joined the company as an executive vice president after finishing law school . <p> Relishing his success , Rahr began to dabble in other activities . He took up golf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " Stewart likes to play a round of golf in 14 minutes . " Along with Carol , his wife of 37 years , who works for a jewelry design company , Rahr started to collect big-ticket art  --  and , naturally , stirred up nasty criticism . One seasoned art adviser who was at a May 2003 Sotheby 's auction where Rahr made a couple of expensive purchases says the Renoir he bought was " an inferior painting " and that he " grossly overpaid " for a work by Max Liebermann . " I 'm very happy with the paintings , " says Rahr . " My wife is thrilled with them . " <p> Another extravagance : an estate in East Hampton on Long Island . The 22,000-square-foot home , on 25 acres facing the waterfront , cost $45 million in 2004 , making it at the time the most expensive house sale in New York history . <p> Rahr hit up employees and customers to raise $100,000 for the families of Sept. 11 victims . His pet cause is the Make-A-Wish Foundation , which helps terminally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million this year to the Children 's Hospital Trust of Boston , in honor of Katie Couric ( whose husband died of cancer ) , and another $1 million to the Robin Hood Foundation , which runs antipoverty programs in New York City ; Rahr 's donation will be used to support a charter high school . <p> Meantime , changes in the drug-distribution industry began to eat away at Kinray 's business . For years it was common practice for wholesalers to speculate on drug prices , stockpiling when they expected a price hike of , say , Paxil or Viagra , and trading back and forth among themselves as if they were trading shares of stock . The manufacturers tolerated this gray market because it allowed them to inflate their revenue figures temporarily . The game ended in 2004 after the Securities &; Exchange Commission sued Bristol-Myers Squibb for going too far with this channel stuffing . The agency claimed that $1.5 billion of Bristol 's 2000 and 2001 sales came from artificially accelerated sales to wholesalers ; Bristol-Myers paid $839 million in fines . <p> The industry has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not all , give a 1% or so discount to wholesalers in return for a promise by the latter not to stockpile beyond reasonable inventory needs and not to buy in the gray market . The loss of speculative markups slammed wholesaler earnings . Among the big three public companies , McKesson swung to a loss in fiscal 2005 ending Mar. 31 ; earnings at AmerisourceBergen dropped 44% and at Cardinal 29% . To make up for the squeeze , Kinray has been selling more generics , which have higher profit margins than branded drugs , and more private-label home health care goods , under the name Preferred Plus . <p> Tougher to adjust to is the rise of mail-order pharmacies . The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association says that 200 million Americans have the mail-order option through their health care coverage ; some plans insist on it . Thanks to that convenience , earnings at the largest pharmacy benefit managers , Caremark Rx and Express Scripts , have risen 20%-plus in each of the past five years . <p> Not at Kinray , which sells only to walk-in pharmacies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is leading a charge , seemingly a hopeless one , against the growing trend . ( In early November CVS announced a $21 billion merger with Caremark . ) There have been a few small triumphs . After New York City 's largest municipal workers union , District Council 37 , agreed to allow its members to choose the corner drugstore option , Rahr joined independent pharmacies and testified before the New York City Council to ban mail-order-only plans . The union claimed it saved a pile of money with mail order but says it relented only because a small portion of its members pleaded for the continued convenience of going to corner drugstores . Nevertheless , Rahr took credit for the win and had hundreds of " Welcome Back " banners made up and sent to pharmacies . He is also lobbying Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell to support a bill to ban health plans from forcing mail-order drugs on state employees . A similar bill failed to pass last year . <p> On other fronts Rahr is learning the limits of his bullying . Recent attempts to undermine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped Pfizer catch employees of the Springfield , Ill. company selling a counterfeit version of Lipitor in 2003 . When Pfizer continued to supply H.D. Smith , Rahr protested and tried repeatedly  --  and vainly  --  to get an audience with then Pfizer chief Henry McKinnell . Rebuffed by Pfizer 's lawyers , Rahr eventually gave up last summer , shortly before McKinnell was fired by the board over pay-for-performance issues . Rahr says he just did n't have the energy to keep chasing that one . <p> He once had more fighting spirit . In 1998 he went after Continental Investment Corp . The now-defunct o-t-c bulletin-board stock had once promoted stain-removal products for carpets but captivated Rahr with its claim to have potentially one of the world 's biggest landfill sites . After touring a giant granite pit near Atlanta , Rahr invested a total $12 million from 1996 to 1997 . Soon after , he discovered an engineer 's report , contained in Continental 's filing with the sec , that explained the land was unusable as dumping grounds . Rahr 's shares went from $20-plus to zilch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alleging securities fraud , and won in a Dallas courtroom . " I 'm the wrong man to anger , " he says . But despite a $233 million verdict in 2000 against Continental 's former executives , two of whom went to jail , Rahr ended up with nothing except $15 million in lawyers ' fees . He insists he went to battle on behalf of smaller investors who got burned . <p> What will happen to Kinray ? Rahr has no one to leave the business to and no apparent successor . At one point it seemed that son Robert might be in training for the corner office . But after a few years at the company Robert left in 2004 . Now 36 , he works in private equity . Rahr 's daughter , Felicia , 32 , once did fundraising for Memorial Sloan-Kettering but is now doing graduate work in the medical field . She has never worked at Kinray . Company executives all shrug at the question of an heir . <p> Rahr vows he wo n't sell the company . He laughs off recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not like it 's ever been easy . " He insists he would n't risk having any of his 800 employees lose their jobs . His friends say the hyperactive Rahr could n't bear retirement . That said , he is quick to point out that the company has had suitors and flashes a letter from a prospective buyer that says Kinray 's valuation " starts with a one "  --  as in billion dollars . <p> The relatively high-margin operation at Kinray would make it an attractive target for McKesson , Cardinal Health or AmerisourceBergen if any of them wanted a stronger regional foothold . The fact that Kinray  --  essentially a one-warehouse company  --  will never get chain customers like Rite-Aid , Walgreens and CVS is hardly an obstacle to these giant wholesalers . Last year McKesson , the largest of the three , bought D &K,; a regional St. Louis wholesaler with $2.5 billion in sales but only a 0.7% pretax profit margin , for $479 million . <p> David Yost , the chief executive of AmerisourceBergen who has known Rahr for 25 years , says his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good companies , and I would say that Kinray is an extremely well-run company . " How much would Yost pay for Kinray ? He says it would buy at a lower valuation than AmerisourceBergen 's own earnings multiple of 26 . Allowing for taxes and a multiple of 18 , which industry analyst Andrew Speller of A.G. Edwards says is fair , that would value Kinray at $540 million , a far cry from $1 billion . Yost points out that AmerisourceBergen is sitting on $1.3 billion in cash . <p> When pressed , Rahr says he can imagine life without his company  --  with a lot of time devoted to charity and to grandchildren . By then he 'll undoubtedly have a lot more famous friends to mix it up with . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Charity begins with celebs : Ivanka Trump . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cheek by jowl : a hug ; from Mariah Carey . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Hanging with rapper Nelly ( sans Band-Aid ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Matthew Rand <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
