Former United Airlines marketing analyst Mark Boyle has n't worked at the struggling air carrier for 10 years , but every time United 's latest woes hit the evening news , he warily pays heed . About a tenth of his family 's nest egg  --  money earmarked for his and his wife 's retirement , not to mention college tuition for their two teenage children  --  is supposed to come from Boyle 's United Airlines pension . But that potential income is in jeopardy as his former employer tries to reorganize in bankruptcy court . " I watch , " says Boyle , 45 , " but there 's nothing you can do "  --  except worry . <P> Watchful worry is the only option for 34 million Americans who , like Boyle , are stakeholders in defined-benefit pensions  --  corporate retirement programs that once represented a dependable revenue stream for retired U.S. workers but today are increasingly falling into disrepair and deficit . Two weeks ago , the U.S. Comptroller General , concerned about a rise in the number of companies no longer able to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeled as " high risk " a quasi-federal agency that steps in to pay retirees when companies can not . Saddled with a deficit of $5.4 billion and counting , the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp . ( PBGC ) might need a government bailout  --  a predicament that Treasury Secretary John Snow told the Wall Street Journal was " a brewing problem somewhat analogous to the savings-and-loan situation , " the U.S. financial fiasco of the late 1980s . <P> Administration officials say a pension-system meltdown is not imminent , but that 's no consolation for the pilots at U.S. Airways . When that airline went bankrupt last year , the PBGC took over its orphaned pension program and promptly reduced benefits paid to former high-wage workers whose payouts exceeded agency limits . In some cases , pilots ' pensions were slashed as much as 70% . <P> The prospect of imperiled pension programs further tarnishes what were supposed to be golden years for American workers . In the past few years , retirement portfolios have taken hits from all sides , causing employees to rethink their retirement expectations and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent turnaround , the sagging stock market reduced the overall value of 401(k)s and similar retirement vehicles by double-digit percentages . Company stock options and grants have also declined in value . Moreover , the last line of retirement defense  --  the Social Security program  --  will begin running at a deficit in 2017 . That means by the time today 's thirtysomething workers reach retirement age their benefits could shrink by a third . <P> Pensions , the steady stream of income granted in return for years of faithful service , were once supposed to offer a dependable security blanket for millions of older Americans . Lately , though , pension-fund values have been devastated by stock market losses and historically low interest rates on fixed-income securities . " That 's kind of a double whammy , " says Comptroller General David Walker . Over the past 2 1/2 years alone , the total amount of underfunding of corporate plans  --  basically , the difference between what companies are projected to owe their retired workers and the size of corporate pension funds  --  has ballooned by more than $260 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
