But Hey , Who 's Counting ? Just wanted to call to your attention a figure from the last 10 issues of America . Eighty percent ( 8 out of 10 ) of the first letters in the letters column were from religious . Oops : just received the May 28 issue . Now it 's 9 out of 11 ! Interesting ? Jim Cullather South Bend , Ind . Yet Another Friendly Reply I am grateful to Cardinal Avery Dulles for his letter concerning the translation of Walter Kasper 's " Friendly Reply " ( 4/23 ) to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger 's article ; it gives me an opportunity to offer some needed clarifications . A literal translation was never intended ; a good deal of the original ( which was a segment in a series of exchanges ) would not have been fully intelligible to American readers without proper information about its context . For this reason , the permission to translate was requested from the editor of the original with the explicit proviso that " it could not be a straight translation ; some adaptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English text with a caution : it was a " translation from the German , with some adaptation . " This sentence was somehow omitted in the editorial process , in which I had no part . The question is , therefore , whether or not the adaptations to help the American readers were reasonable . Kasper 's original text assumed what was of common knowledge in Germany but not in the United States , such as the repeated refusal on the part of the Vatican to admit to the Eucharist couples living in legally invalid marriages but deserving in faith and charity and to let the local bishops have greater discretion in matters of eucharistic hospitality , and so forth . The fill meaning of the original text , its stance and strength , would have been lost on American readers without due contextualization . Nothing was added but bare historical facts ; none of the facts was incorrect . The refusal by the Vatican was indeed " adamant , " it was applicable to " all " cases , and the rules concerning eucharistic hospitality were truly more " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastors included . This dispute about such textual matters , however , should not distract us from the substantive issue that is the theme of Kasper 's article . What did Vatican Council II profess when it declared that the universal church exists " in and from " the local churches ? The question is far-reaching , and the answer is bound to affect the church 's government as well as the daily life of God 's people . If ever there was an urgent need for dialogue , for " faith seeking understanding , " and for an intense process of inquiry , this is it . Would Cardinal Dulles be willing to partake in such a worthy dialogue  --  friendly , as well , as it must be ? Ladislas Orsy , S.J. Washington , D.C. Pyrrhic Exhaustion My own attitude on Ex Corde Ecclesiae and the mandatum has long been that this document and its attendant juridical norms give both bishops and theologians a perfect opportunity for fighting a battle whose only outcome will be Pyrrhic exhaustion . Judging from my own very limited experience , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about have taken a very gingerly-nay , even conciliatory-attitude to the theologians in their diocese . I have no way of judging how most theologians are reacting , but based on both the thesis and the tenor of Jon Nilson 's article " The Impending Death of Catholic Higher Education " ( 5/28 ) , I am not sanguine . As to Mr. Nikon 's " prophet of doom " scenario , I have only one question to ask : why ever would a Catholic theologian want to teach Catholic theology and not be in communion with the church ? How did it ever come about that theologians have not assumed from the beginning of their academic training the value of a magisterial background to their discipline ? As Hans Urs von Balthasar puts it so deftly , " the more obediently one thinks , the more accurately one will see . " If Professor Nikon 's article proves to be typical of the reaction of most Catholic theologians to Fx Corde , then the situation is bleak indeed . The acerbic social commentator Midge Decter once spoke of America-bashers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase has equal relevance inside Catholic academia . Edward T. Oakes , S.J. Denver , Colo . Basic Courses Jon Nilson worries that implementing Ex Corde Ecclesiae will doom Catholic higher education in the United States ( 5/28 ) . Catholic institutions will have to choose to " become secular or sectarian . " Perhaps some of his worries are justified with regard to faculty members who publicize views foreign to Christian tradition . But the " nuclear annihilation " of Catholic colleges looms more from the spiraling costs , excessive bureaucracy and the " me-tooism " of aping secular private institutions . I recently read a brief history of the origins of the Jesuits in the midwestern United States . Along with their commitment to work with Native Americans , these Flemish pioneers had an obsession with higher education that led to excellent universities in St. Louis , Cincinnati and Detroit . But along with their insistence on high standards in the arts and sciences , these founders of Catholic colleges ( and many others ) promoted Catholic devotion and Catholic religion ( not " theology 's courses among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " religion " courses perhaps even more . As long as Catholic higher institutions prepare students with rigorous academic programs ( sometimes resisting expensive and useless fads ) and give them basic courses in Catholic history and catechism , they will survive . Maybe that will make them " sectarian . " Despite the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists ' opposition to Reagan 's military build-up , the Doomsday Clock has stopped ticking . Long after dust has settied on Ex Corde Ecclesiae and its commentators , Catholic colleges and universities will be responding to the needs of students and the zeal of parents and those who years ago started these institutions . Joseph Krastel , C.SS.R . Grand Bay , Dominica Who Counts ? The cover for the May 28 issue was delightful ( " Time to Dust Off the National Pastoral Council ? ' ' ) . I noticed that there were five women and three men . I think that ratio rather accurately reflects the reality of the church in the United States . Somehow I seem to sense that there is a lesson in that .

" <p>  - -  WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE L : The Hope of Home Dialysis We recently heard from Harvey Wells , who was settled in an RV campground in Florida and anticipating cooking ribs for his daughter later that day . Like others in his generation , Wells spends as much time as possible with friends and family , including the grandchildren who live several states east of his Texas home . Last summer he and the kids made a 12,500-mile cross-country trek in his RV . Now , they were getting together again to celebrate the Christmas season . <p> Wells wants Post readers to know about his experience with an innovative medical device that travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular dialysis treatments to filter his blood of impurities -- a procedure that he performs at home ( of , often , in his RV ) with the NxStage System One . <p> Wells says he was initially attracted to the freedom and flexibility of performing daily dialysis at home versus going to a specialized treatment center three times per week . <p> " The flexibility is a huge plus , " he explains , adding , " but to me , the real advantage is the health benefits . I call it ' the miracle machine . ' I have more energy , and my blood pressure is stabilized . " <p> Research supports Wells ' observations . Experts say that frequent dialysis therapy allows the machine to function more like a natural kidney , resulting in treatments that are gentler on the body . Interim findings from the FREEDOM ( Following Rehabilitation , Economics , and Everyday Dialysis Outcome Measurements ) study reveal fewer symptoms of depression ; a quicker return to normal activity ; and improvements in physical ability to complete daily activities , general health , and energy after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightly treatments ( three to six nights per week ) are also promising . Dialyzing at night allows for a slower flow rate that may remove more wastes than the shorter treatments and also frees up daytime hours for other activities . <p> " When I compare the year and a half I 've been on the NxStage machine to the previous year and a half I was going to the center , it is the difference of night and day , " concludes Wells . " To me , this machine not only keeps you alive , it helps you live better , longer . " <p> L : Chronic Kidney Disease About 26 million Americans have chronic kidney disease -- the precursor to kidney failure , which currently affects more than 500,000 Americans . With rising rates of diabetes , hypertension , and obesity , experts predicted a 60 percent increase in the number of kidney failure patients by 2020 . <p> Wells does not have diabetes . His kidney failure resulted from Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS )  - -  a disease that attacks tiny units ( glomeruli ) within the kidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardening . First noted on a military physical at age 18 , his FSGS symptoms worsened some 20 years later , and a kidney transplant was performed in 1998 . That kidney , donated by his wife , failed in January 2006 . In March 2007 , he started daily home dialysis . <p> L : Needs Help for Her Cough Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> My problem is that I can not get the mucus up so that I can expel it . Several cough syrups , drops , expectorants , and mucus-relief tablets have not helped me . <p> This problem lasts several hours and sometimes all day . Could it be connected to my sinus drainage that I have had all my life ? Thanks for any help you may provide . <p> The Saturday Evening Post is my favorite publication and the first thing I read is Medical Mailbox . <p> Mary Nelson Muscatine , Iowa As you suggest , coughs may be triggered by sinus drainage and postnasal drip .

Now I would like to return the favor . June Jordan , in the September/October 2008 issue , wrote about her hands cramping . There is a simple solution : I was having leg cramps at night , and a friend told me about putting a bar of soap between the sheets where my legs rest . Lo and behold , the cramps disappeared within two or three minutes . <p> Last night , I awoke with my right fingers curling up in a cramp . I tried the " soap treatment " and went back to sleep . In the morning , my fingers were uncurled and pain-free . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stop muscle cramps . Might you be able to solve the mystery ? <p> Your comments would be greatly appreciated -- your column is invaluable to me . <p> Josy Wiener Boynton Beach , Florida We may never know why soap may help relieve muscle cramps . Should we ever experience the problem , however , we will probably give it a try . Loyal Post readers like you are among our best sources of remedies that may work . <p> Lysine is an inexpensive and safe amino acid . To treat mouth sores caused by the herpes simplex virus , the late Dr. Richard Griffith recommended a daily lysine dose of 500 milligrams per 22 pounds of body weight . Lesser amounts help avoid outbreaks .

James Via e-mail L : Medical Updates New research may benefit Medical Mailbox readers and their loved ones coping with conditions mentioned in previous issues -- Mnire 's disease and persistent heel pain . <p>  --  Two studies published in November 2008 offer hope to people who experience balance and hearing loss related to Mnire 's disease . Researchers in Valencia , Spain , report that the number of debilitating episodes tends to decrease as time goes by . When they do n't , Dr. Stephen Wetmore of West Virginia University School of Medicine in Morgantown found that surgery to drain fluid from the inner ear 's endolymphatic sac improved the problem in 77 percent of 51 cases . A second sac surgery was beneficial in 65 percent of 14 people who experienced recurrent symptoms five months or longer after the original procedure . <p>  --  Inflammation of a thick band of tissue ( called the plantar fascia ) often causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients not helped by conventional therapies for plantar fasciitis , doctors report that all but two were pain-free within two or three weeks of a procedure called dry-needling followed by a steroid shot . During the procedure , doctors insert a needle into the area where the fascia connects to the heel bone . This creates a small amount of bleeding and activates blood platelets to help the tissue heal . The needle is then pulled back into soft tissue surrounding the fascia and used to inject a steroid . The promising data was presented by an Italian research team at the 2008 annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America held in Chicago . <p> L : Eye Experts Have Different Training Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> I had a driver 's permit before moving to Iowa . Here they have a questionnaire for an optometrist or ophthalmologist to fill out . Years ago , an optometrist told me that he had done all he could do for my vision . What does an ophthalmologist do ? <p> E. Hern Keokuk , Iowa An ophthalmologist is a physician who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some ophthalmologists learn to care for children 's eyes , perform corneal transplants , or do plastic surgery . In most states , an optometrist or Doctor of Optometry ( O.D. ) diagnoses but does n't treat eye diseases . Many provide low vision rehabilitation and perform minor surgeries . Both types of eye specialists are trained to examine the eye , diagnose eye diseases , and prescribe glasses and contact lenses . <p> Each state passes its own laws about the requirements necessary to obtain and renew a driver 's license . <p> Regular dilated eye exams may detect early . signs of trouble and could help save your sight . <p> L : Types of Glaucoma Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> I have been going to an ophthalmologist every six months for two years . I go every six months because I 'm prone to having glaucoma . At my last visit , the doctor said my eye pressure is fine so far but that I have a rare form of glaucoma . He said narrow angle , but I did n't ask if it was the acute kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms ? Do I need to watch more carefully for certain signs and symptoms , and how dangerous is narrow angle ? Could I go blind quickly if I do n't get help right off ? <p> Mrs. Gail Manelick Gardiner , Maine We sent your letter to Indiana University glaucoma expert Dr. Darrell WuDunn . He explains : <p> " The angle that is narrow in your condition refers to the area through which the fluid in the eye drains out . Different forms of glaucoma are based on the configuration of this angle . Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form in the USA . In angle-closure glaucoma , the iris , or colored part of the eye , blocks fluid drainage and causes elevated eye pressure . Having narrow angles does increase the risk of developing angle closure glaucoma . This can happen abruptly in an acute angle-closure attack , or it can occur more insidiously in chronic angle-closure glaucoma . In either condition , damage to the vision can occur . When acute angle-closure develops , you may experience severe eye pain , redness , blurred vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomiting . If these symptoms occur , you should seek emergency treatment to prevent or minimize vision loss . Permanent vision loss or blindness can occur within hours during an acute angle-closure attack . If you have particularly narrow angles , an ophthalmologist may recommend a laser procedure to widen the angle and thereby decrease the risk of angle-closure glaucoma . Regular monitoring of your condition is also important . <p> L : Treating Pernicious Anemia Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia in 1982 and prescribed 1000-microgram shots of B12 ( cyanocobalamin ) every month for the rest of my life . I have since moved , and my current doctor advises that 100 micrograms a month is sufficient , a dose I have been taking for more than two years . I have many health problems and am wondering if a lack of B12 could be causing them . <p> Billie Stone Austin , Texas There is study data to support both doses . To confirm the best amount for you , we suggest that you consider asking your doctor to order a complete blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shape of your blood cells . <p> The term " pernicious " or " fatal " anemia dates back to the time before scientists discovered that it is a vitamin deficiency disorder . Characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition include feeling tired and weak , tingling and numbness in hands and feet , and a bright red , smooth tongue . Your cardiovascular health problems seem to have started before switching to the lower dose of cyanocobalamin . <p> L : A Heartfelt Thank You Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> In your November/December 2008 issue I happened to read that leg and hand spasms could be caused by the cholesterol medicines . I had been having such severe pains that I would have to pull over in traffic because I was afraid to drive with them . I tried eating bananas and all the other things people said would help to no avail . <p> I showed the article to my doctor who took me oft of the cholesterol meds .

It 's important to keep cholesterol in check so please consider discussing your lipid levels and necessary therapy options with your doctor . <p> L : Omega-3s in Fish Oil Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> I started taking fish oil omega-3 a year ago . I seem to feel much better ( more zip ) , and for the first time in my life I have fingernails . I 've been made fun of and told to not believe everything I read . <p> My question to you : Is fish oil with omega-3 good for me or not ? I truly enjoy The Saturday Evening Post , especially the medical part and the jokes . I believe omega-3 is good for me -- and so is the laughter . <p> Margaret Coy Muncie , Indiana Laughter adds to out overall well-being , and we 're pleased you enjoy the Post 's cartoons and jokes . <p> Experts say that omega-3 supplements are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( EFA ) . The human body needs it for life hut must get it from foods or supplements . Omega-3 and other EFAs serve multiple functions . People have different nutritional needs and dietary habits . In general , taking one gram of omega-3 ( either EPA or DHA or combined ) is a good maintenance dose for healthy adults . <p> L : Sleepless in South Carolina Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> My husband has had sleepless nights since ending chemotherapy in July 2007 . He has tried prescriptions , herbal teas , and over-the-counter sleep aids . He may sleep for a couple hours upon going to bed but lies awake the rest of the night . He does not have sleep apnea , and all his blood tests are fine . Can any of your readers suggest help for this condition ? <p> Mrs. Thomas Luizzi Taylors , South Carolina L : Mineral Oil : More Cons than Pros Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> Mary Jo Arn 's letter in the November/December 2008 issue prompted me to ask if mineral oil is still available as a laxative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arn suggested . It was used years ago for the problem , but I never hear of it now . Can you advise me ? <p> Geneve Stevens Jackson , Mississippi Mineral oil is a lubricant laxative that coats the entire gastrointestinal tract . Frequent use of the product , however , may interfere with the absorption of important vitamins and minerals from foods . Mineral oil also interacts with blood thinners and may decrease the effectiveness of other drugs and supplements . We advise that you opt for a safer way to address chronic constipation . <p> L : Therapies for Systolic Hypertension Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> I 'm diabetic and have systolic hypertension . My systolic pressure runs from 115 to 120 in the morning and 120 to 170 in the evening . <p> I 've included a list of the medicines I have tried .
