<p> " Horses for courses . " It 's a British expression roughly equivalent to " different strokes for different folks , " i.e. , different racehorses perform differently on different racecourses . Something to bear in mind for The Chronicle-BayTV Book Club , where this month we dismount from David Wong Louie 's " The Barbarians Are Coming "  --  under discussion at 8 p.m. this Thursday with host Barbara Lane and me on BayTV 's " Bookmark " show  --  and saddle up for Jane Smiley 's decidedly different " Horse Heaven . " <p> Smiley herself is rightly prized by readers for following a very different course every time out of the gate . " The Greenlanders " played variations on Scandinavian folklore ; " Moo " was a comic novel set on a college campus ; 1998 's " The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton " a distaff " Huck Finn " ; " Duplicate Keys " a mystery ; and her Pulitzer Prize-winning breakthrough , " A Thousand Acres , " a pastiche of " King Lear . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kings to the sport of kings . It 's an epic comic novel with more than 50 characters , not all of them bipeds . Writing last week on the cover of Book Review  --  just a coincidence , book club handicappers  --  novelist Debra Spark had this to say about it : <p> " ( Smiley ) pulls it all off by writing flawlessly , but also because her book turns on questions about luck and choice . . . . The material about luck leads to musings about what one can and can not know about a horse 's future performance , and thus to questions about an individual 's ability to control circumstances . . . . Instead of seeming cutesy  --  Mr. Ed in literary garb  --  the animals ' point of view ( like the humans ' ) is complex , persuasive and thought-provoking . That we take the animals ' thoughts , emotions and memories seriously is one of the real triumphs of the book . " <p> Really , a triumph ?

How do Smiley 's efforts compare with theirs ? Just because " Horse Heaven " is funnier than " A Thousand Acres , " does that make it lighter ? And what is it about women and horses , anyway ? <p> A-a-a-a-a-and . . . we 're off ! <p> AN EXCERPT FROM HORSE HEAVEN ' <p> Here he was again , Justa Bob , justa racehorse . Justa Bob flared his nostrils and snorted in the familiar smells , yes . Pivoted his ears like satellite dishes , yes . Turned his head this way and that to focus his big eyes on the scene he was born to see , yes . His skin shivered over his muscles as if flies were landing on him , but it was n't only the excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now he was among them , signals flying everywhere . He whinnied a single loud greeting , and other whinnies answered him immediately , Hello , hello , hello , I 'm here , I 'm here , too , hello , a ripple of whinnies spreading from Barn C out over the backside , until , far away , they had nothing to do with Justa Bob at all , only to do with Hello , I am here , where are you , I 'm here , too . <p> JANE SMILEY HAS 16 HORSES AT HOME <p> Though now living in Carmel with her son , two daughters and 16 horses , Jane Smiley was born in Los Angeles and raised in St. Louis . After graduating from Vassar College in 1971 and completing graduate school at the University of Iowa , Smiley taught at Iowa State University from 1981 to 1996 . <p> She is the author of 10 works of fiction , including " The Age of Grief , " " The Greenlanders , " " Ordinary Love and Good Will , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Smiley has also written many essays for publications such as Harper 's , the New Yorker , the Nation , Mirabella and Vogue on topics ranging from Mark Twain to Barbie dolls . <p> Married three times , Smiley is now at work on a novel about sex in Hollywood . <p> WHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING <p> " A fast-paced , fetchingly detailed , wide-angled view of the world of horse breeding-and-racing and another lively illustration of Smiley 's industrious literary work ethic and gift for transmuting the products of her obviously extensive research into compelling fiction . " <p>  --  Kirkus Review <p> . <p> " There 's a benign deity at the helm in Smiley 's world . Her final chapters have a wonderful restorative quality , filled with grace notes and epiphanies that offer a fitting close to this smart , warmhearted , winning book . " <p>  --  Bill Barich , The New York Times <p> . <p> " Smiley 's horses almost steal the show from the humans in this symphonic celebration of the byzantine world of thoroughbred horse racing , although a mischievous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative eye pans her way . . . . Smiley enriches her electrifying and at times melodramatic tale of two years on the thoroughbred racing circuit with a wealth of intimate knowledge about horse breeding , training , and racing , not to mention sensuous description and supple human and equine psychology .
