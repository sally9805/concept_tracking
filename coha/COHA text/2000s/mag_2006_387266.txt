Getting ready for her new assignment on the Today show , Meredith Vieira shares her private side-from the crisis that made her marriage stronger to why her kids think she 's a mess BY JENNY ALLEN // though it 's a mild , sunny day , it would be entirely understandable if Meredith Vieira arrived for lunch in a snit . She 'd planned to have a driver take her to the restaurant where we 're meeting , inside New York City 's Central Park , but barricades blocked the roads . So the soonto-be coanchor of the Today show , succeeding Katie Courie as the woman who wakes up America , has been forced to hike a quarter mile along the park 's looping , confusing paths-in black stiletto heels . But as she strolls into the restaurant , dressed in cream-colored slacks and a snug knit top , she is unshaken . " I walked here , " she says in that familiar throaty voice , her smile warm , her green eyes direct . She sounds calm , even amused by her little misadventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BlackBerry . She does not even carry a purse . She holds only a cell phone , which she politely keeps turned off for the next two hours while she talks about the work she loves and the rich , challenging family life she loves even more . Vieira has had nine years of exposure on The View , the wildly successful ABC morning chat show she moderated until last May . She 's also spent four years hosting the syndicated version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire . And , as any fan of The View knows , she has three children and a husband of 20 years , television producer and writer Richard Cohen , whose health problems have been openly discussed by Vieira in the past . Vieira will turn 53 in December , and she has the laugh lines and creases to prove it ( she has said she 'd like to avoid plastic surgery for now ) . Today she is wearing thick television pancake makeup , but only because she has n't had a chance to scrub it off yet . Sometimes she forgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she jokes , " like a washed-up prostitute . " This is pure Vieira and a large part of her huge appeal : She 's a mix of stunning and soulful , a beauty with a big mouth and a warm heart . Settling in at the table , Vieira instantly reveals herself as a woman who is not in the habit of lunching out . " What 's in a Cobb salad ? " she asks of the entree that appears , it seems , on the lunch menu of every New York City restaurant . Told its ingredients-chicken , blue cheese , and bacon , among others-she orders one . ( Later , a fellow patron will use the salad as an excuse to approach Vieira , asking her about its contents . Vieira patiently describes the salad in detail and clearly makes the diner 's day . ) Off camera , Vieira is busy raising three teenagers-Ren , 17 , Gabe , 15 , and Lily , 13 . They are one big reason she has enjoyed her tenure on The View-there has been virtually no travel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to drive them to various after-school commitments . Without their blessing , she would never have considered taking the Today show job , as plum an assignment as it is . The prospect of being beloved by early-morning millions is certainly not a bad feeling-nor is the reported $40 million she 11 earn over four years . But , she insists , " my decisions have always been connected to my family , because if it does n't work with the family , it 's not going to work . Maybe you 've gotten more pay at another job ... but if you 're miserable at home every night , it 's not worth it . " So when it came time to decide whether to leave The Viewfor the Today show , " I did n't do it lightly , " she says . " I did n't do it lightly at all . " She mulled over the offer for six months-though she knows some may find that baffling . " A lot of people said to me , " Why would you think twice ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things do n't matter-certainly , I 'm a breadwinner in my family , " she says . " But that 's never been why I do something . " Yet Vieira admits she was flattered by the idea of following Couric- " I thought , Do they know how old I am ? " - and impressed with Matt Lauer , her future cohost . Invited to dinner at his apartment last December so the two of them could take each other 's measure , she debated about what to wear before opting for comfort : jeans , a white T-shirt , and a black jacket . On the subject of clothes , she jokes , " I do n't own any . " Vieira never goes shopping and has , she says , absolutely no interest in keeping up appearances . " I 'm kind of a tomboy , " she says , " and I was never a girly girl in my life . " To Vieira 's relief , Lauer answered the door in jeans and a swearer and immediaiely offered her a glass of wine . Vieira recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Still , as she weighed her options , " I spent a lot of time in the fetal position , crying , " Vieira says . She was daunted by the job 's early-morning and early-to-bed hours , as well as by the breaking-news intensity and globe-trotting assignments . But one of the main reasons for tears was " a real fear of change , " she says . " Fear of failure . Fear of success . " At The View , she had " nice hours and an easy life . There 's a real camaraderie and a comfort factor when you know one another , " she says , sounding wistful . " Meredith does not like change , to say the least , " says her husband . " It does not sit well with her . She had warm feelings for all the people she worked with . But I felt , and the kids felt , that it was a wonderful opportunity for her . It was lime for her to spread her wings-which is something she preaches to the kids on a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a list of the people who doubt that she 'll do a great job : Meredith . That 's the end of the list . Everyone else thinks that she was born to take this job . She has so hit her stride that she could do it backward and left-handed . I wish she had half the confidence in herself that other people have in her . " Vieira readily admits to being a chronic worrier . " It makes me want to kill her , " her husband says cheerfully . The notion of being ill-prepared is always on her mind . She is a woman who , in her first years at The View , would do research " for hours , " she says . " Richard would say , " Wait a minute . Miss Piggy is the guest tomorrow . What are you studying ? ' It was just this feeling of : I wo n't know enough , I wo n't know enough . " Her children " were much more level-headed " about her new gig than she was , Vieira says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember sitting with my son Gabe and saying , " I wo n't be there in the morning . ' And he was like , " What are you talking about ? We 're not six years old . All we do is fight in the morning . ' ' " Her oldest , Ben , used the same advice she had given him when he switched to a new school and knew no one . " He said , " You told me that it would be hard but I 'd come out of it better-and I think you will too . ' He saw it as something really exciting . " As for her youngest child , Lily , " her attitude was always " Do n't let anybody tell you what to do . You do what makes you happy , " ' Vieira says . " And when I was really starting to panic , she sent me a beautiful e-mail . " It read : " No matter what , we love you . If you take the job , we love you . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When Vieira read the note , she burst into tears . " Lily just said , " God , you 're a mess . " When Vieira finally said yes to Today last April , it was agreed that she could be somewhat choosy about when she travels-but she is also excited about bringing her family on some irips . ( Ben has been studying Chinese , and the prospect of Vieira 's covering the next Olympics , in Beijing , was hugely appealing . ) On The View , she talked about her family constantly-which her kids did not always appreciate once they became adolescents . " You know , they 're teenagers , and they 're very protective of themselves , " she explains . The Today show calls for less anecdote sharing , and this seems right to Vieira. now that her decision has been made , Vieira has traded in fear for a cheerful fatalism . " People said , " You do n't want to be the one to follow Katie . It 's like being Deborah Norville , the one to follow Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out . Maybe it is , " she says with a shrug . " That 'll be interesting . " Advice from Couric herself has helped . After Vieira officially took the position , the two of them spoke . Vieira reports that Couric asked , " Are you getting tons of people saying , Oh my God , the pressure you 're going to be under ! How are you going to do this job ? ' Why do people actually take the time to ask things like that ? What is that about ? " Vieira found that reassuring . But she was taught to be strong from an early age . She was raised in East Providence , Rhode Island , with three older brothers . " I was always kind of a tough cookie because I had them , " she says . " I was much more aligned with their way of thinking . " Her mother , a homemaker , and father , a doctor , were both first-generation Portuguese-Americans . Most of her father 's patients were Portuguese immigrants ; many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Suddenly there would be a stranger in the yard , mowing the lawn . I 'd say to my mom , " Who 's that ? " She 'd say , " Oh , that 's Mario . He 's Daddy 's patient . ' ' " Her parents sent Vieira 's three brothers to a Quaker boys ' school and Vieira to its sister school , which she loved . " It was extremely empowering , " she says with a smile , " almost too much so . Our senior year , we took classes at the boys ' school , and we would come out of class going , " What idiots . " " School may have made a difference , but her parents were her inspiration . Her mother was a " June Cleaver mother-there were always cookies being baked , " but she was fiercely opinionated as well , a die-hard Republican and " always outspoken . " Her mother never said she wished she herself had a career , but " I think that she wanted more for me , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there and be something . Especially as a rebellious teenager , I thought , I do n't want to end up like you , around the house . It was n't until I had children that I began to see that she was everything I wanted to be . I was fortunate enough to be able to say that to her before she died , " at 90 years old , two years ago . " She died in her bed . I was holding her in my arms . All her kids were with her , " she says softly . " It was just the way she wanted to go . I should be so lucky . ' ' " Her father was " a great man , " quieter than her mother , hut an example nonetheless . When a 20-something Vieira was fired from an early on-air job at a Providence television station , she went home and cried in her room . " My dad said , " Do you believe you have no value ? ' I said yes . And he answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' So the next day , I marched back into the office and said , " I 'm going to prove you wrong . ' ' " The news director agreed to give her a second chance . " Maybe he had n't seen that backbone , " she says proudly . " He saw it that day . " A few months later , she was " discovered " when a headhunter was passing through Providence and caught Vieira on a broadcast . Many years later , after earning fame as a network news reporter for CBS , Vieira stood up for herself again . In 1989 , as a coanchor of CBS 's 60 Minutes , she negotiated a part-time schedule to accommodate her desire to spend time with her first baby-a schedule that did not sit well with the men who ran the show . When Vieira , pregnant with her second child , declined an assignment that required flying , her bosses lost patience . By 1991 , she was out . " It was a tough time , " she says , but she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the money , the whole thing , " she says , " at the end of the day , that did n't matter . " Working less over the next few years allowed her the rime with her kids that she coveted , and then The View came along . Nevertheless , as Barbara Walters says now , " The View was an unknown quantity , and so was Meredith , " who would be trying her wings outside the news arena . But Vieira took to it straightaway ; after 20 years of delivering just the facts , she suddenly had an opportunity to blab away about anything she liked . " I would n't shut up , " she says of her earlier days . " I was so out there-anything that I thought came out of my mouth . " Vieira may cringe at her earlier candor , but Walters has nothing but praise for her former cohost : " She 's very dear to us . She lives in a beautiful home , but she is personally unmaterialistic . She cries if you kill a cockroach-we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the studio ; I scream about them , and Meredith wants to take them home on a leash . " That beautiful home , in a suburb along the Hudson River , has undergone a major , year-long renovation lately . The overhaul did not make the house larger as much as rearrange rooms so that the kitchen and family room captured the best light . Previously , Vieira explains , the best-lit area had been the front of the house , near the driveway . " Richard and I would sit in our driveway on Sunday , reading the paper , basically in our underwear , " she says . " People would walk past us with their dogs . It was very Beverly Hillbillies. " thanks to her candid comments on The View and her husband 's own memoir , millions of people are aware that Vieira 's husband lives with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , diagnosed when he was 25 , and has endured two recent bouts of colon cancer . Now Vieira is grateful for even the simplest pleasures . She is looking forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putter around at home . As for hobbies , " I knit , but I 've been knitting a scarf for a year , " she says . " I ca n't stick with anything . " She loves to hike and run , although it saddens her that her husband , whose MS has made walking more difficult and who is now legally blind , can no longer join her . " That was something we loved to do together , " she says quietly . " I hate that we ca n't anymore . " For the moment , however , their dark days are apparently behind them . In 2004 , Cohen wrote a moving and wrenchingly honest best seller , Blindsided : A Reluctant Memoir , about the effects of his illnesses on himself and on his family . In the book , he gives a harrowing description of his despair and rage after his two bouts of cancer , in 1999 and again 11 months later . He is now in remission . " I wanted to leave him sometimes , " Vieira told Walters when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . Now , says Cohen , " I ca n't say it 's as if it never happened , but pages have turned . Things have lightened up . " Today , at lunch , Vieira jokes about her husband 's blindness : " I think he 's faking . Somehow , he can still spot a beautiful woman , and he still beats me when we play pool . " Though Cohen walks with a cane and has trouble carrying things " there are days that are terrible , " Vieira admits- " we try to laugh about it as much as we can . " Meanwhile , she takes solace in knowing that " if four years from now I decided , All right , that s enough , " the family would be secure enough financially that she could quit and care for her husband if it eventually became necessary . As she leaves the restaurant , a beaming older woman calls to her , " Hey , Meredith ! " Vieira responds , " Hi , how are you ? " as warmly as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outside the park , there is another older woman , this one dressed in rags , sitting in the street , leaning against the curb . Vieira watches to see if she has fallen-but , no , it seems she has just decided to sit there awhile . " That breaks my heart , " says Vieira . But then her heart is pulled in a different direction . Her cell phone , which she has turned back on , has begun to ring , and it 's her son on the line . It 's time to answer the call and go home .
