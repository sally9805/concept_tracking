EDITED BY DAVID MASELLO ALEX VON BIDDER , co-owner with JULIAN NICCOLINI of New York 's Four Seasons restaurant , says of the diners assembled : " You can be sure that everyone having lunch here right now has something going on at the table other than what 's on his plate . The focus is the purpose of the meal . " Now celebrating its fiftieth anniversary , the inimitable modernist space , designed by Philip Johnson , has remained a culinary temple of power and beauty , elegance and social splendor . Writer Michael Korda considers the restaurant the venue for the power lunch , based on his many meals there . Jackie Onassis spoke of the place as her " personal cathedral , " while Johnson himself ate there daily . In fact , there is never a day at the Four Seasons in which the tables are not occupied by the famous and the accomplished . And because how one appears at the restaurant has much to do with the experience of dining there , von Bidder and Niccolini , who have both been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on matters sartorial rather than culinary .

VON BIDDER : Our clientele still expects it . We never have complaints about someone having to put on a jacket . We have complaints from our guests when we seat someone without a jacket . I think the business world in Manhattan is still pretty conservative . We have a sign downstairs that reads " Gentlemen required to wear jackets ; no jeans , please . " Some men simply forget to wear their jackets , so we have blue blazers in every size . If the temperature outside is over ninety degrees , we do n't enforce the jacket code . After all , we 're not unreasonable ! Still , the best way to make an impression in this society is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NICCOLINI : Honestly speaking , I am the only one who does not like to enforce a dress code . Of course , we recognize when a man comes in looking shabby  --  in jeans and sneakers , my God ! But there is so much wonderful sports clothing from designers like Zegna and Brioni and Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers . You can be elegant and chic without a jacket and tie . Who are your favorite designers ? NICCOLINI : I only wear Brioni suits  --  because I can walk down the block on East 52nd Street , stop in there and pick up whatever is ready for me . I only wear these socks pulling up blue pin-striped pant cuffs to reveal wildly striped socks . These are Gallo socks , and I get them only in Venice . I go to Brooks Brothers to buy my shoes ; it 's a very good and affordable brand . VON BIDDER : I was lucky to make friends with Alan Flusser when he worked for Van Heusen shirts , a long time ago . I love the philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suit should be lived in , that it should conform to your body after a long time . As soon as I could afford it , I would buy one or two of his suits every year . And I have never bought suits from anyone else . My shirts are Brooks Brothers , in part because they make French cuffs the right length , long enough to peek out from the suit sleeve . I 'm very lucky in that I do n't have to buy ties . People who come here are always wondering what to give me for Christmas , so I get lots of Ferragamo and Herms ties  --  I love them ! Because I 'm on my feet all day , I wear these completely comfortable Australian ranch boots from R.M. Williams . But when I conduct my regular Sunday yoga classes  --  I 'm a certified instructor  --  I go barefoot . 99 East 52nd Street ; 212-754-9494 ; **25;2997;TOOLONG
