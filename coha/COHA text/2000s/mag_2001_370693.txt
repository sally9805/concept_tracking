You 're right . It 's the worst summer in movie history . Except for a few lonely lurkers in the art-house shadows , crying for your attention . And no , we do not mean Sexy Beast , a dull , predictable and unattractive caper film that is the inexplicable " quality " hit of the season . Our raves go instead to an internationally eclectic group that includes : <P> DIVIDED WE FALL <P> WHERE IT 'S FROM Czech Republic <P> WHO MADE IT Director Jan Hrebejk and screenwriter Petr Jarchovsky <P> WHAT IT 'S ABOUT A biblically named couple , Josef and Marie ( Boleslav Polivka and Anna Siskova ) , who , during World War II , agree to hide David ( Csongor Kassai ) , a concentration-camp escapee . Josef and Marie desperately want a child , which , for medical reasons , they are unable to conceive . Will Marie fall for David 's soulfulness ? And what about the increasingly harsh Nazi occupiers ? <P> WHY IT WORKS There 's something slyly funny about all these people stirring about in cramped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their situation too . A sudden noise , a door left unlocked , a nosy neighbor  --  almost anything could fatally unhinge it . Hrebejk and Jarchovsky know how to balance farce against fear , human complexity against moral imperatives , without falling into Life Is Beautiful sentimentality . The result is a lovely movie , one that allows its characters unexpected spurts of growth and regression , darkness and grace . <P> THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY <P> WHERE IT 'S FROM The U.S. <P> WHO MADE IT Writer-director-stars Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh <P> WHAT IT 'S ABOUT The dicey , dusk-to-dawn celebration of their sixth wedding anniversary by Joe and Sally Therrian ( Cumming and Leigh ) . Nothing very dramatic happens : some drugs are done ; some half-nude swimming is indulged in ; some contingent truths are told about the Therrians ' relationship , which is troubled by the rise of his career , the decline of hers and the question of having a child . Their guests are largely played by the auteurs ' acting pals ; all the characters have something to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bluster to fragility , from savagery to sympathy , in the blink of an eye  --  without revealing which is the real emotion , which the fake . <P> WHY IT WORKS There is something realer than real in everyone 's playing . You feel that their edgy suburban twaddling may be the way Hollywood heavies really behave in private . Some of the " actors ' moments " linger too long , but a shadowy anger and misery underlie the sometimes choked-off wit of this free-form chamber piece shot on digital video . Everyone in the cast has his or her solo , and all rise brilliantly to their occasions , notably Gwyneth Paltrow , Jennifer Beals , Mina Badie and a divinely neurotic Jane Adams . <P> WITH A FRIEND LIKE HARRY <P> WHERE IT 'S FROM France <P> WHO MADE IT German-born Dominik Moll
