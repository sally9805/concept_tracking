The rookie did n't faint or lose his lunch . Detective Jack Leightner supposed he ought to give his new partner some credit for that . <p> <p> A patrol officer met them outside the crime scene , an abandoned row house on the edge of Crown Heights . The uniform looked a bit pale . " It 's not pretty in there , " he said . " The body was n't found for a few days . " <p> <p> Jack just glanced at the crowd of scowling locals standing beyond the yellow tape , out in the brutal August heat . " Keep an eye on my car , " he said , then turned to his partner . " You ready for this ? " <p> <p> The young detective from the Seventy- first Precinct nodded in a show of eagerness . " Let 's do it . " It was Kyle Driscoll 's first time as primary detective on a homicide . He was in his late twenties , and he had burnished brown skin and the confident good looks of a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , but its odor met them downstairs , as soon as they walked into the dark front hallway , starkly lit by a floodlight one of the Crime Scene techs had planted to guide the way . The smell was god- awful and sickly sweet . Thousands of years of evolution had prepared human beings to hate this particular scent : it meant Avoid this spot . Bad things happen here . <p> <p> The young detective swallowed . " Should we do that thing with the Vicks VapoRub ? " He was still doing his best to act enthusiastic , but the smell was clearly getting to him . <p> <p> Jack tried not to grin . As a veteran with Brooklyn South Homicide , it was his job to temporarily pair up with local detectives and assist them with their murder investigations . " What thing ? " he asked . <p> <p> The rookie squirmed . " Do n't you smear it under your nose to cover up bad smells ? " Even real cops were susceptible to false information from TV shows ; in Jack 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> <p> He shook his head . " We do n't do that  --  all it would do is burn your nose . Do n't worry , you 'll be fine . " <p> <p> The rookie nodded . The young man had earned his detective 's shield , but he 'd spent his first few months on robberies and assaults . He wanted to prove that he was ready for the big show . <p> <p> The house was an empty shell waiting to fall in on itself , but Jack noticed some elegant architectural details  --  crown moldings , a dusty , gap- toothed chandelier  --  from an earlier era . The rookie pulled up short as they reached the top of the staircase . Through the first doorway on the left  --  a bedroom , judging by a dingy mattress on the floor  --  they could see a whirlwind of activity . The plywood in the windows blocked any natural light , but the Crime Scene Unit had lit the place with more floodlights on stands . Jumpsuited techs crouched down searching for evidence , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators bustled back and forth . In the heart of the maelstrom , as always , was a terribly lonely and still center . In this case , the body was that of a young black woman , hanging by a rope attached to a chain that had probably once supported another chandelier . She was half dressed , in a shorty negligee ; she wore her orangey hair straightened and it looked almost shellacked ; her light brown legs were purpled with the blood that had settled within . Despite her current puffy condition , Jack figured that she had been a pretty young woman . <p> <p> He turned and caught the rookie staring . He 'd wanted to see , to become privy to this dark knowledge , and now he probably wished he had n't . <p> <p> " The M.E. 's guys control the body at the scene , " Jack explained . " That guy in the white shirt is Anselmo Alvarez , head of the C.S.U . " <p> <p> The rookie stared up at the corpse ; Jack did n't know if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconcerting ; he reminded Jack of his own early days with the NYPD . He recalled the shock of his first few bodies . And he remembered farther back , his first memory of a corpse , when he was a little kid : the sudden jolt of adrenaline he 'd felt after almost stepping on a dead squirrel on a sidewalk , its wiry body splayed and stiff , its little watermelon- pit eyes staring up , accusing . There was something terribly unnatural about any creature with its animating spirit gone , and sensible people did everything they could to avoid looking at such things . Jack saw himself and his colleagues through this rookie 's nanve eyes now , and thought something he rarely bothered to think anymore : What a weird goddamn job . <p> <p> He squared his shoulders . There was no room for emotion here , or philosophy : this was just a puzzle that needed to be solved . He turned to the kid . " We 're going to have to wait a few minutes until we can get inside . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look relieved . <p> <p> Anselmo Alvarez stepped out into the hallway . He and Jack had become friendly over the years , two fairly small men in a world of big cops , and two relative outsiders , a Dominican and a Jew . Alvarez was the best forensics man in Brooklyn . He started to offer a prelim , but Jack waved him off . " This is Kyle Driscoll from the Seven- one . I want him to look at the scene fresh , without any preconceptions , and see if he can tell us what happened . " He had a son a few years younger than the rookie . Though he had never felt right talking about the job with Ben  --  or with his ex- wife  --  he liked to mentor young detectives , to reach them before the job made them jaded or cynical . <p> <p> The photographer had finished his work , and it was time for Jack and his young partner to go in . The rookie hesitated before they stepped over the threshold , but this time it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back . <p> <p> " Something on your mind ? " Jack asked . <p> <p> The rookie squinted . " Um , yeah . If this woman killed herself , then why is Homicide here ? " <p> <p> Jack nodded . " That 's a good question . Let 's see if you can answer it . " <p> <p> The room was sweltering ; Jack felt his shirt cling to the small of his back . As they moved inside , his own questions began to pop like firing nerve synapses , but he kept them to himself . <p> <p> The Crime Scene crew had left a stepladder next to the vic , and he climbed up for a look at her neck . Then he moved down and examined her fingertips . Finally , he turned to the rookie . " You all right with a closer look ? There 's something up there I want you to see . " <p> <p> The rookie nodded . He climbed the ladder gingerly , as if he were ascending a gallows himself . <p> <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jack said , patiently . <p> <p> While the young detective followed his suggestion , Jack turned away and surveyed the rest of the room . Even without the corpse , it would have smelled bad . The place was a mess , with junk- food wrappers strewn about , a pile of dirty clothes over by the window , an open Domino 's box sitting next to the soiled mattress , revealing a half- eaten pizza . A bitter odor , faintly detectable under the overpowering scent of the body , gave away one reason for the human presence here ( crack cocaine ) , and an economy- size box of condoms half tucked between the mattress and a dusty baseboard gave away another . Jack noticed one unrolled , forsaken condom lying next to the bed , and he crouched down for a closer look . Then he straightened up and motioned toward the door . " That 's enough for now . " <p> <p> THEY STEPPED OUT OF the house and into a blast of humid summer heat , but the fresh air still felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several radio cars and a Crime Scene van were pulled up to the curb . Across the street , another small crowd had gathered : not resentful black neighbors , but dour , bearded white men . Despite the heat , they wore black suits and black hats . Crown Heights was home to three main population groups : African- Americans , black immigrants from the West Indies , and these ultrareligious Hasidic Jews . <p> <p> The rookie breathed deeply . Jack gave him a moment to recover , then turned his attention to the matter at hand . " So : why was n't this a suicide ? " <p> <p> The freshly minted detective frowned in concentration . " There was something weird about the neck . It looked like there was another mark across it , instead of just from the rope . " <p> <p> Jack nodded . " That 's exactly right . In a hanging , the ligature mark would rise up behind the ears , but here we have a mark that goes straight across , which would indicate strangulation . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by an electrical cord . " He leaned back against the stoop 's iron railing , then noticed flakes of rust coming off onto his sports jacket , and moved away . ( Despite the often grubby nature of his job , he was a bit fastidious . ) " Did you notice the condom next to the mattress ? " <p> <p> The rookie frowned again . " Um , I think so . It was unrolled , right ? " <p> <p> Jack nodded . " Yeah , but what else ? " <p> <p> The rookie squinted . " I do n't know . " <p> <p> Jack crossed his arms . " It was dry and empty . Now why would there be an open condom lying there with nothing in it ? " <p> <p> He watched the detective struggle to work through the implications . " Whoever was using it did n't , um , finish what he was doing ? " <p> <p> Jack nodded . " You 're doing good . Let 's try to re- create the scene . Someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or maybe her pimp . He unrolls a condom but ca n't finish his business . Or ca n't get started . Maybe she says something about his manhood , or maybe she does n't even have to ; either way , he gets enraged . He reaches out and there 's some old appliance lying there and he strangles her with the cord . Did you notice that I looked at her fingernails ? " <p> <p> The rookie nodded uncertainly . <p> <p> " What do you think we might find there ? " <p> <p> The rookie squinted . " The killer 's DNA ? Like , what if she scratched him as she tried to pull his hands away ? " <p> <p> " Actually , we often find the victim 's own tissue under her fingernails : she digs into her skin , trying to pull away the cord . So anyhow , " Jack concluded , " the perp calms down and sees what he 's done , and then he tries to cover it up by making it look like a suicide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a rocket scientist . " <p> <p> The rookie sank down onto the stoop , took out a handkerchief , and wiped his face . <p> <p> THEY SPENT THE NEXT couple of hours canvassing the neighborhood for witnesses . Fruitlessly . Nobody wanted to step up and get involved , not the distrustful black locals , not the sour- looking Hasidim . They checked with a local Vice team to see if the victim was a known hooker , but no luck there . They showed a photo to some working girls  --  nada  --  and then ran it by some informants on the local drug scene . Nothing . And then their tour was over . <p> <p> " Do n't worry , " Jack told his new partner . " We 'll have an I.D . soon . We 'll get a match on her prints . Or we 'll find out who was selling her drugs . . . . " He certainly hoped he was right  --  the odds of solving any homicide dropped drastically after the first forty- eight hours . <p> <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the Seven- one house . As they passed a bunch of little kids dancing around in the spray of an open hydrant and then rolled by clusters of old folks sitting on folding chairs right out on the sidewalk , Jack left him alone ; the young detective had plenty to think about . <p> <p> " You got any questions ? " Jack finally said . <p> <p> The rookie chewed his lower lip . " Does , ah , does it get to you ? " <p> <p> " The bodies ? " <p> <p> The rookie nodded gravely . <p> <p> Jack leaned back and dropped his forearm on his armrest . " We do this every day . We kick into an investigative gear as soon as we hit the scene . If we got emotional or took it personally , there 's no way we could do the job . " <p> <p> The rookie frowned but did n't speak . <p> <p> " What ? " Jack said . <p> <p> The rookie chewed his lip . <p> <p> " Something bothering you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wondering why everybody did n't wear Tyvek jumpsuits . I thought that , after O.J. and all , we were supposed to be more careful about dealing with possible evidence . " <p> <p> Jack glanced at him . The rookie was looking straight ahead , as if he was embarrassed . " Well , law enforcement all across the country has been more careful since the Simpson thing , but that does n't mean that we 're gon na have a perfect textbook setup for every single investigation . If you watch some of these TV shows , you 'd think that every murder gets solved by forensic evidence , but in real life that 's pretty rare . Most cases still get solved because we found a witness or because the mutt confessed . " <p> <p> The rookie still frowned . <p> <p> " What ? " <p> <p> The rookie looked away . " I was just wondering if maybe there would have been a more textbook setup if , you know  --  if the victim had n't been black . " <p> <p> Jack resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car into Park . " Listen , " he said . " You 've been on the job long enough to know that every case gets its own priority . And yeah , the killing of some crack- addicted hooker is not generally the highest- precedence type of situation , as far as the brass or the press are concerned . But if you 're suggesting that we might do a shoddy job because of the color of her skin . . . " <p> <p> At the next red light , he turned and stared at the young detective . " I do n't hear you complaining about the fact that the victim was a woman . Or that somebody cold- bloodedly murdered a prostitute , because he thought nobody would give a shit . . . " Despite all his talk about professionalism and detachment , he pictured the girl hanging so helpless in that dismal room and he felt a deep flash of anger toward whoever had done this to her . " That girl was n't able to protect herself , and now she ca n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand up for her . " <p> <p> The young detective looked only slightly chastened , but enough so that Jack did n't feel a need to point out that if the case had been high priority , the rookie would never have been given responsibility for it . He was here to encourage the kid , not bust his chops . And so he added , decisively , " And you know why we 're gon na put some extra mojo into this case ? " <p> <p> The rookie shook his head . <p> <p> " Because this bastard thinks he 's smarter than the NYPD . " Excerpted from Neptune Avenue by Gabriel Cohen .
