More than ever , investors of modest means who are looking for financial advice will have to go it alone . That 's the lesson behind last week 's sacking of CEO David Pottruck at discount brokerage Charles Schwab . Since taking the sole helm at Schwab 14 months ago , Pottruck has been unable to make the firm 's middle-market strategy pay . And with onetime everyman firms like Dean Witter gone and Merrill Lynch refocused on the rich , it 's not clear that anyone will step up with a full plate of services for ordinary folks . <P> " You 're basically bisecting the market , " says Matt Snowling , a brokerage analyst at investment firm Friedman Billings Ramsey . For folks with more than $150,000 to invest , firms like Merrill and Smith Barney offer comprehensive financial services .

Since May 2002 , Schwab 's lowest-rated stocks have outperformed its top-rated stocks . " They 're trying to be too many things to too many people , " says Lauren Smith , analyst at investment firm Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods . <P> With founder and eponym Charles Schwab replacing Pottruck , many expect the firm to focus on the discount brokerage business , which accounts for 70% of its pretax income . But Schwab could make a decisive assault on the full-service brokerage industry or even be put up for sale . What 's clear from the firm 's troubles  --  it lost 44,000 accounts in the second quarter , when profits fell 10%  --  is that the middle market is a tough racket . Do n't look for anyone to rush into this void . <P> Where can you find help ? <P> SMALL BROKERS Firms like Edward Jones , Raymond James and Legg Mason still serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss global research and IPOs . <P> ONLINE Good stock , mutual-fund and asset-allocation information is getting easier to find on websites like
