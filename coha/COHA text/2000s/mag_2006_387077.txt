REVOLUTIONARY TEAM Headnote Florida 's starters shunned the NBA to return to the Gators-and , they hope , to the national championship game By Kyle Veltrop // A game net , celebration photos and commemorative newspaper pages , all displayed in handsome custom frames , hang on a wall in Billy Donovan 's home office . The words 2006 National Champions adorn the outside of Florida 's basketball complex . Dazzling rings have been distributed to everyone involved . The Florida Gators , though , have more than souvenirs , bold-lettered proclamations and jewelry to remind them of their magical three-week run into NCAA basketball immortality . They have players , too-lots of them . Joakim Noah , Corey Brewer and Al Horford , who all would have been NBA first-round picks last June , opted to return to school-where they rejoined Taurean Green and Lee Humphrey . Many think it 's Florida vs. the field this season . Good luck , field . Two days before practice began for a new season , those five returning starters and senior sixth man Chris Richard gathered on campus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Flight to the NBA delayed Horford : We all thought we could get better by working on our game for one more year . Each of us still can get better , and we like playing together . We really did n't get pressure from our families or anything like that ; each individual was allowed to make his decision . Brewer . It was a difficult decision , but I figured I still could grow as a player and as a person . Bottom line was I wanted to come back and play with these guys again . Noah : Al was my roommate last season , so I had a feeling he was n't going to leave . And when Corey said he was going to stay , there was no question-I was , too . But if one of those guys had left , I would have gone , too . We all felt that way . We may have had an opportunity to go to the NBA , but we have no idea what the future holds . I know what my situation is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys . I would n't trade that for the world . Richard : The rest of us had a lot of confidence Al , Corey and Jo would be back because all of us want to do it again . We also have some unfinished business in terms of winning the SEC regular-season championship . Getting along with their bad selves Noah : Everyone here is very different , coming from different backgrounds , different cultures . The thing that makes us so close is we have one goal : We want to win . Richard : We 're all open-minded . We 'll pick up some things here and there about each other 's cultures , whether it 's foods or languages . I 'll watch a little of the Spanish channel with Al and ( sophomore guard ) Walter Hodge . Usually , when we leave the basketball complex , we all go eat together and then have a PlayStation tournament or just fool around . Noah : You 're not going to see " Humpty " ( Humphrey ) in the club with us , shaking his butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go to the club , that 's cool . He 's still my guy . When you go through something like that together , winning a championship , that 's something you remember for the rest of your life . I know in 20 years , even if I have n't spoken to one of these guys in a long time , I know they will be there for me . Brewer : Why wo n't you have talked to me in a long time ? What are you going to do , lose my number ? Gators on Gators Green on Humphrey : In practice , the coaches get mad when Lee gets an open shot . But even if you have a hand in his face , the coaches still get mad because Lee ends up making seven out of 10 shots . There 's really nothing you can do . It does n't matter if I 'm guarding him , Corey 's guarding him . He just knocks down shots . Humphrey : My dad was a teacher and a coach , so we had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there when I was in fourth grade . I like to get in the gym and shoot . Brewer : And shoot and shoot and shoot .... Noah : Lee can take any shot he wants . In our offense , there are layups , dunks and Lee Humphrey . Noah on Horford : Al did n't get the attention he deserved last year . He opened up so much room for me because of the double-teams he demands any time he catches the ball in the post . And I 'm sure Humpty and Taurean get a lot of the shots they do because of Al inside . Humphrey on Green : Last year we 'd be matched up against each other a lot in practice , and it was tough because he 's quicker and faster than me . But that prepares me for games because I 'm used to facing one of the best point guards in the country . Horford on Brewer : Corey is one of those high-energy players , always hustling . He has to be one of the worst guys to face when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gaps . Or we can say , " Corey , you 've got to lock this guy up , " and he 'll follow guys off screens all game . He 's a lockdown defender , man . He 's on edge out there . Brewer on Noah : What makes Joakim such a great shot blocker is his timing . It 's certainly not because he 's a great leaper or anything ( laughing ) . It 's great having Joakim behind you because if you get beat , you know he 's going to be in the right spot at the right time . With Joakim and Al behind me , 1 know if the little guys get too far in , they get scared . Green : We want the little guys to drive on us . Noah on Noah : A lot of people told me that I 've got to show that I can be a good shooter . Coach gave me a DVD and told me it had all of my baskets from last year , but he only showed one of my jumpers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my baskets from running the court , getting offensive rebounds and getting shots when Al or Corey passed out of a double-team . Coach told me he wanted me to work on my jump shot . And I feel like , I ... definitely ... did , like , work on it ( laughing ) . That 's not my thing . Shooting jump shots is not what I do . I 'm going to do what 1 do to help the team . Brewer : I do think Joakim 's 15-footer has improved . Horford : ( Laughing . ) The scouting report 's still going to say , " Back up . " Hoops , not hype Noah : People expect me to , I do n't know ... . If I 'm not the No. 1 pick next year , then 1 did n't have a good year . Or if I 'm not the college player of the year , then I did n't have a good season . So I 'm not going to let expectations mess up this team . The winning is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brewer The hardest thing is going to be keeping the hype out of our heads . Do n't worry about what the media 's saying , what the fans are saying . Just go out there and do what we do : Play hard , lock up on defense , share the basketball and come out with a victory . Richard : I do n't think we 'll have a problem with the hype because everyone on the team is a great player , so if you show up for practice with a cocky attitude , you 'll get embarrassed . We can be better than last season . We made a lot of mistakes last year , but we are older now and should cut down on those . We also have four freshmen who will allow us to press more and give us more frontcourt depth . Noah : It 's going to be a very different year . We ca n't sleep on any team because there 's going to be another Florida Gators out there , a team that is really hungry . We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough : We were hungrier . We have to keep that edge . The goal is to win the championship , but you ca n't just snap your fingers and get there just like that . It 's a process , and we need to take care of everything that will help us get there . But we 've been there before . We know what it takes .

Sidebar History rarely repeats itself Since college basketball last had a repeat title winner-Duke in 1992-four national championship clubs returned their cores but failed to win it all again . * North Carolina . Eric Montross , Brian Reese , Derrick Phelps and Donald Williams came back from the 1993 title team , but the Heels lost in the second round to Boston College the next season . * Arkansas . Scotty Thurman , Corliss Williamson , Corey Beck , Dwight Stewart and Clint McDaniel returned , but the Razorbacks lost to UCLA in the 1995 national title game . * Arizona . Mike Bibby , Miles Simon , Michael Dickerson , Bennett Davison , AJ . Bramlett and Jason Terry returned from the Wildcats ' 1997 title team but lost to Utah in the Elite Eight the next season . * Duke . The Blue Devils lost Shane Battier from their 2001 team . Four stars-Jason Williams , Carlos Boozer , Mike Dunleavy and Chris Duhon-returned , but Duke lost to Indiana in the Sweet 16 . So history , and Rorida coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty tricky . " We have a good team , but the odds of us repeating are not with us , " Donovan says . " We could be better than last year and not get as far . " What could stop the Gators ? Complacency , perhaps . A better guess would be injuries , a bad draw or , simply , an off night . That 's the nature of playing in the one-and-done format of the NCAA Tournament . Donovan welcomes-and understands-the high expectations heaped on the Gators , but he hopes they are n't labeled a failure if they do n't retain their title . " Corey ( Brewer ) , Jo ( Noah ) and Al ( Horford ) had the opportunity to leave , " Donovan says . " But they did something that is uncharacteristic . These guys could have left here at the highest point . I hear so much criticism about kids who leave early . I just hope these guys are treated with a sense of gratefulness because they came back . They chose happiness over money and other materialistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are high for Noah , and he knows it . But he also knows he 's not going to let them affect his game . // <p>
