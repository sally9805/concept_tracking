This story marks the fiction-writing debut of M. Ramsey Chapman , who writes from New Mexico . A DIRT-STREAKED YELLOW taxi drove silently up Alvarado Street in the early dawn . The sun had peeked over the horizon a few minutes ago . In an hour , still-sleepy adults would begin emerging from their homes - some of them clutching bagels or travel mugs of coffee - and start making their way to work or taking their kids to school or daycare . An hour after that the angle of the rising sun would ignite the oven that the neighborhood became each day for six months of the year . But for now the street was quiet and cool . The brunette in the backseat was n't very talkative this morning , and Jack wanted to break the silence . " I 'd play the radio , " he said . " But it has n't worked in ages . " There was no response . After a moment , he said : " I sure am sorry . " " Do you know how many times you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack started to speak but caught himself . Apologizing for apologizing would only make things worse . " You sure you only want two hours ? " he said . " /only want one . You wanted longer . We compromised . Remember ? " " I know . It 's just that it 's the last time either of us will ever see " em . " " Which is what makes it so painful and why I do n't wan na prolong the experience . I ca n't believe you even talked me into this . " " It 's the right thing to do . " " I think it 'll only make it worse . We should just turn around and never let " em hear from us again . " Jack spun the wheel to the right and steered the cab onto Old Pierce Road . One block up was an aged blue and white bungalow with a mailbox painted to look like the New Mexico flag . It was where Jack first picked April up two weeks ago , though it seemed now that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door wearing a tight yellow floral dress that did n't quite reach her knees , and even though his head was pounding fiercely from the previous night 's bender , Jack had n't been able to keep his eyes off her smooth , tanned legs . He had kept his gaze on them as she kissed her hubby good-bye and then turned and walked toward the cab , her hips swivefing deficiously in the tight dress . As she drew closer , he had slowly raised his eyes , appreciating the curves of her body , until his gaze met the scowl on her face . Jack had grinned in reply . Then he added a wink . He felt ashamed of himself now , knowing what April was going to tell her husband - and what he was going to tell his wife . " It 's gon na be hard on " em , " he said . " I know . " " I 'm gon na try to soften it as much as I can . " " You think I 'm not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more tense and defensive April had become . He pulled the cab into her driveway and stopped but did n't set the parking brake . He heard the click of a door latch and then the squeak of hinges . The cab gave a bounce and then - slam ! Jack rolled down his window and the scent of pine trees and flowers flowed in . As April walked around to his side of the car , he saw that the bright blue-and-white morning glories in front of the house were still open . " Two hours , " she said . " Be on time . " " I will . " He rolled up his window and April watched him slowly back the cab out of her driveway and then glide silently up the street . When the cab turned the corner onto Alvarado , April summoned her courage and faced the house . She and Kyle had bought it three years ago , just after they were married . It was their first house , and he carried her over the threshold . That memory made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stepped up onto the porch and stood on the spot where she had kissed him goodbye for what was supposed to be a short visit to her mother 's . Fate had had something else in mind , she thought . Jack changed everything . April fumbled with the contents of her handbag and finally produced a set of keys . She unlocked the front door and opened it - slowly , so that the noise would n't wake Kyle . She stole inside and looked around the living room . It had southern exposure , so it was still dim at this time of morning , but she could see well enough . April wrinkled her nose . There was an unfamiliar smell - sweet and sour - like trash going bad . Her gaze slid across the furniture - the old , ratty couch , the coffee table with patchy varnish , the metal folding chairs , and the soft , green recliner that leaned too far back on one side because it had a broken spring or something . There was a pile of raggedy hunting magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It struck her - for the first time , really - just how shabby it all looked . Of course , Kyle had known it all along . He 'd apologized for the fact that they had to make do with used furniture , most of which he had gotten from his parents . She had told him that she did n't care what kind of furniture they had . As long as they were together , that was what mattered . And she 'd meant it . Until now her feelings for him had kept her from realizing just how pitiful their home was . She turned and walked resolutely toward the bedroom . Sunlight was streaming through the curtains , but Kyle was n't yet awake . He lay sprawled on one side of their bed - her side - a yellow pad of paper and a pen next to him . On the night table stood a large vase of dark green glass with a dozen long-stemmed roses in it . There was also a mostly finished jug of Arbor Mist Strawberry White Zinf andel - her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was still half full . April picked up the jug and swished around the wine . Looks like only three or four glasses left , she thought . Her wine snob sister had always ribbed her for liking " that horrible stuff , " but at least they could afford it , and April enjoyed the strawberry taste and smell . She unscrewed the cap and poured some in the unused glass from the night table . It was warm and the aroma was strong . It was supposed to be served chilled and the taste would be off , but April took a gulp and reached for the legal pad beside Kyle 's sleeping form . " THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOU , " he had written at the top of it . Below that was a numbered list naming her smile , the way her eyes sparkled , the way her hair smelled , and her long , beautiful legs . He 's a guy , so of course the physical stuff comes first , April thought as she took another gulp of wine . The list continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - just like an angel - and the work she did with the youth group . It listed her sympathy , her understanding , how encouraging she was when he was sad , and how she did n't complain when he went hunting or fishing or about their old house and shabby furniture . April rolled her eyes . This is why they invented the word maudlin , she thought . There was more , but April did n't read it . She put the pad down and drained the last of her glass . Looking at Kyle , she felt a knotting in her stomach . He must have cried himself to sleep , she thought . She bent down and touched the side of his face . He 's dreaming about me . Jack pulled the taxi into the parking lot of the nearest grocery store . It was an Albertson 's , and he thought the odds of anyone recognizing him here were pretty small . He was still on the side of town where April lived , so he did n't have any friends here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . Patty did all the shopping for them . Jack had dropped off customers here over the years , but he doubted any were here at the moment . Many had been little old ladies who did n't drive and probably were n't even alive anymore . He found a space next to a battered blue Suburban with California plates . After pulling up beside it , he reached into his pocket and drew out a thick wad of bills - mostly twenties that customers had given him , plus the fives and ones he used to make change . The outer bills were wrinkled and grimy . He spent a few moments counting them .... $100 ... $200 ... $300. . . $400 . When he finished counting he found that he had $484 , which was good . He 'd need to overpay and overpay big - the bigger the better for the result he needed . He climbed out of the cab and looked around warily . There were a few customers in the parking lot , but none were looking at him . He pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn John Deere cap . Entering the store , he spotted the florist 's stand and went straight to it . It was too early for the florist to be there , but the refrigerated case still held a few flowers left over from yesterday . There were no roses of any kind , but Jack found something acceptable : a large bouquet of yellow chrysanthemums . Then he went to find the school supplies section . He kept his face pointed down the aisles , skipping sideways from one aisle to the next , fast enough to look like a man who did n't want to be bothered . When he found the school supplies , he grabbed two items : a pack of Bic pens and a small spiral notepad with a picture of Dale Earnhardt and a NASCAR logo on it . He opened the cardstock panel on the front of the notepad and carefully tore off the barcode revealing its price . Then he inspected the rest of the panel and the cardboard backing to verify that the price was n't printed anywhere else . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle and looked around . There was no choice now but to expose his face to the whole store as he looked for what he needed next . And there it was : a cardboard display stand of the local newspaper in front of the checkout counters . He would have preferred to use the metal vending machines outside - he could have gotten a Wall Street Journal from them - but he could n't overpay in the amount he needed to with a coin slot , so he 'd have to make do with a copy of the Las Cruces Sun-News . He grabbed a paper and went to the nearest open checker . The young Latina looked as if she were about to fall asleep . Jack did n't know if she was just finishing or beginning a long shift . She was far too young to be anyone he knew , but he kept his gaze down as he plunked the newspaper , flowers , pens , and notepad onto the conveyer belt - making sure that the notepad was the farthest from her reach . She sleepily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scanned the barcode on the pens . When she came to the notepad , she picked it up and turned it around a couple of times . " Sorry , sir , " she said with an accent . " I ask for a price check on these . " She picked up a telephone handset and started to speak , but Jack said : " Sorry , darlin ' ! " Fraid I ca n't wait ! " He snatched the notepad , grabbed his other items , and slammed $484 down on the conveyer belt . Instantly , his hands began tingling , and he quick- walked out of the store . Outside , he broke into a sprint and made it to the taxi . He hopped in , fired up the engine , and sped off as quickly as he could , not looking back to see if the clerk had followed him out the door . Several blocks later , he slowed and found a place to park . Sinking back against the torn vinyl seat , he felt his heart racing . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bic pens and ruffled through the newspaper until he found the stock market listings . He closed his eyes , his hands still tingling from the overpayment , and struck blindly with a pen , circling a name at random . When he opened his eyes , he discovered he had circled a company called Barton Pharmaceuticals . Placing the newspaper with the stock page face up on the passenger 's seat , Jack reached into the change cup that he kept in one of the cab 's beverage holders . As he grabbed at its contents , he felt a charge like static electricity jump from his hand to the coins , which now felt tingly . Quickly placing his fist over the open stock page , he tossed a handful of coins into the air . At the height of their ascent they froze in place and hung , suspended for a full two seconds before plunking down on the paper . Five were heads up and twelve were heads down . He opened the Dale Earnhardt notepad and wrote " BARTON PHARMACEUTICALS . FIVE YEARS . NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a folding chair into the bedroom and put it down with the back toward Kyle . She sat in it backward with her arms folded on the top of the metal chair-back and studied his sleeping form . She sat like this for a long time - killing time , frankly . After pofishing off the rest of the jug of strawberry Zinfandel , she played with a rose from the vase until she pricked her finger on one of the thorns , causing a bright red drop to well out . She sucked it off and then began popping the thorns off the stem , using her long , polished fingernails to keep from getting pricked again . When the stem was bare , April gave an impatient sigh and stood up . She shimmied out of her yellow floral dress and her underpants , dropping them on the floor . After unhooking her brassiere and hanging it on the chair , she sat carefully on the bed and slowly lay down next to Kyle . She ran her fingers through his sandy hair and could tell he was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long separation . When he saw her , he rushed up and flung his arms around her . Lifting her off her feet , he began peppering her face with kisses . Then he sensed that something was wrong and his eyes widened . He was about to speak when April interrupted . " Do n't say anything , honey . I 'm here with you now . " April slid under the covers and snuggled up to him . She lightly danced her fingernails across the back of his neck in the way that always drove him wild , and his dream face relaxed and moved closer to kiss hers . Lips glided against lips . Hands glided against hips . Their bodies pressed together , and then ... Kyle opened his eyes and gasped . He scrambled away from her , crossing his side of the bed and plopping onto the floor . He clambered a few feet backward until he was up against the door of the clothes closet and could go no farther . Jack pulled into his own driveway and sat for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the two weeks " worth of salt-and-pepper whiskers on his chin . It would be a terrible shock for Patty , and he did n't know what he could do to cushion it . Given how early she rose , she was almost certainly up . Heck , she 'll have eaten breakfast and done the dishes by now , he thought . He stubbed the cigarette out in the ashtray and got out of the cab . Marching dutifully up the front walk , the chrysanthemums in hand , he made his way to the doorstep and rang the bell . A few moments later , Patty opened the door . Her face blanched . She staggered backward , heaving in air in horrible , sharp , sickly gasps that made it sound as if her lungs were about to rip . For a moment her eyes were starting out of her head , then her eyelids sank and she tumbled backward onto the green shag carpet . Jack pulled open the screen door and rushed to her side , kneeling beside her on the rug . He reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He flipped it open and pressed the hot key for 9-1-1 . Nothing happened . Damn ! he thought . The battery has n't been charged in two weeks . He was about to run for the landfine when it struck him that he should check Patty 's pulse in case she needed CPR . He seized her wrist and felt for the beating of her heart . It was fast , but strong and regular . Okay , he thought . She 's not in danger at the moment . What can I do to help her ? He grabbed the sides of her head and concentrated . She was in the darkness of the void - no consciousness , no thought , just the neutral nothingness that exists between dreams . Jack closed his eyes and thought about the night the two of them met . It was a good memory . He had been on his best behavior , and she had seen nothing but his good points back then . He pushed the memory down toward Patty and she stirred slightly . In a minute , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near normal speed . Whew ! he thought . Kyle sat against the door of the closet , trembling . " It 's okay ! " April said . " Do n't worry . Everything 's okay . " " ? - How can you be here ? " April looked at him steadily and let a long moment go by , hoping that the extra time would let him regain some of his composure . It did n't seem to work , though . Kyle continued to quiver , his breathing fast and shallow . Finally she decided that there was nothing to do but say it flat out . " I 'm a ghost , " she said . " I 'm April 's ghost . And I 've come to say goodbye . " Patty was reliving the night of the dance , the night she first saw Jack and got her friend Wanda to introduce them . Jack was thin and handsome and considerate . He was wearing dark blue jeans and a freshly pressed white shirt and a new straw cowboy hat . He asked her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after song . In the kaleidoscope of memory fragments , he looked like some kind of Greek god in a tile mosaic . After the dance he offered her a cigarette and her first beer and then the two of them went parking in his pickup truck . Patty opened her eyes and looked up at Jack . He was kneeling beside her , cupping her head gently in his hands , and he looked like the seventeen-year-old Adonis she had met at the Future Farmers of America dance . " Am I dreaming ? " she said faintly . " We both are . But it 's time to wake up , darlin ' . " Jack 's features came into focus and his clothes changed . Now he was forty and bulky and unshaven and wearing a denim jacket and a grimy John Deere cap . " I love you , honey , " he whispered . " I know , " she said softly . Then she added : " I 'm so glad you 're here . " This is all wrong , April thought as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shock , to blend Kyle 's dream with reality so that when he finally realized that she was here - really here and in his arms - it would be a glorious , romantic experience . Now he was cringing on the floor , his face sweaty and white . " Do n't make me say it , " she said . Kyle looked confused . " ... that you look like you 've seen a ghost . " Kyle did n't laugh . He did n't do anything but sit there , trembling like a cornered mouse afraid that she would step on him . It 's not fair , she thought . I tried to cushion the blow . Why ca n't he just accept what I did for him ? She frowned and thought : He 's always been like that . He never fully appreciated me . I 'm here to give him a gift few ever get , and he ca n't even meet me halfway . " Do n't you have anything to say ? " Hi , honey ! I sure did miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked hurt . " Of course ! " he said , and atearstartedtoroll down one of his cheeks . " I 've missed you more than I can say ! L.J just . . .1 just do n't know what to do ! " Kyle let his head sag down for a moment . Then he pulled it back up and looked at her , his eyes bloodshot , tears streaming down both cheeks now . " Is it really you ? " he said . " How can you be here ? " We 're covering old ground , April thought . " Yes , it 's really me , " she said tersely . " And I do n't know how I can be here . It just happens this way sometimes . I think it 's some kinda quantum thing . Temporary particles split off at the crucial moment or something . " Kyle 's eyes darted to the foot of the bed and then slid up it , observing the way the sheet was draped across her naked body . " You 're .. . solid ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . I know my real body was such a mess after the crash that you had to have a closed casket funeral . I know it 's buried six miles from here . But I 'm solid . And I 'm whole . The cab driver 's the same way . And his cab looks like it did before the crash . It just does n't make any noise now and you wo n't smell any exhaust as it drives by . " Kyle hung his head again and sobbed . " I thought I 'd never see you again , " he said hoarsely . Now we 're getting somewhere . " So that 's why I came back , " Jack said . The two of them were sitting on the couch , and Patty had lit a cigarette . His arm was around her , and he gave her shoulder a little squeeze . " I know I was n't a good husband to you - " " You were a wonderful husband ! " " You say that now . You 're still in mourning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you know it ai n't true . I ran around on you . . . some . And I drank too much . I was hung over the morning I died . That 's why I ran the red light . " Jack lowered his head and said , " And there was that one night . " Patty looked somber . That one night Jack had come home after getting his ass kicked in a bar fight but it was Patty who ended up in the county trauma center . " That was fifteen years ago , " she said . " I forgave you , and it never happened again . " " I know , but I was n't the kind of husband that I should have been , and I want to make it up as best I can . " Jack looked down at the bouquet of chrysanthemums in his lap . Feeling stupid , he handed them to Patty and said , " These are for you . I know you like roses or orchids , but there were n't any at Albertson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because someone who knew me - who knew that I 'm dead - might see me . " She lifted the flowers and smelled them . Then she looked at Jack and smiled . " Yellow mums are my new favorite flower . They always will be . I 'm going to hang these upside down and dry them out so I can keep them . " Kyle had regained enough composure that he could sustain a conversation . He was still pale and shaky , but he could talk . " Your mom told me that she thought you said something to her , but when she turned around , you were n't there . " " That was me , " April replied . " I said I loved her , but she could n't hear it clearly . " " Your friends said stuff like that , too . Barbara told me that she was doing the dishes and felt your presence in the room with her . " " Me again . " " She said she thought God was making some kinda exception - so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's not as much a exception as you might think . This kinda thing happens all the time when people die . " Kyle looked surprised . " I 've never heard of anyone having a solid ghost visit them , " he said . " Well , that 's not so common . I fade in and out . The conditions have to be right . I could n't make it all the way through to Momma and Barbara , but somehow I knew I 'd be able to stay solid for you . Unfinished business . " April flung the bed sheet off and got up to begin dressing . " You know what I found out during my little post-mortem cab ride around our friends and family ? I found out Barbara ai n't the friend I thought she was . She 's had the hots for you for years . I imagine she 'll be making a play for you soon - wanting to " comfort " you in your grief . " Kyle looked at her , dumbfounded . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as she finished putting on her dress . " I 've seen you looking at her , too . " Now Kyle looked guilty . Good , April thought . Someone needs to hold him accountable for his sins . She sighed . " I do n't guess I can expect you to stay faithful to me forever . You 're a man , and you wo n't be able to keep your pants zipped . Sooner or later you 'll want to remarry. . . but not her . Understand ? I do n't want you taking that bitch into my bed . " Kyle 's expression changed . April could n't decide if it was surprise or anger . Maybe it was both . Then it struck her that she 'd never used the word bitch in front of him before . " I 'm just being honest , " she said . " I ca n't be a Sunday school teacher twenty-four/seven . If I ca n't let my hair down around you , where can I ? " Jack was seated on the fraying red chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin in places that it had come apart , and Jack enjoyed absentmindedly pulling out the stuffing from the arms . Now the curved wooden frames inside them were exposed . " Can I getcha some breakfast , honey ? " Patty asked from the kitchen doorway . " How " bout a Coors ? I 've still got a couple of twelve-packs in the " fridge .... I could n't bear to move " em , so I kep " " em cold for you . " Jack stood up and strode toward her . " I do n't want any beer , " he said . " The dead do n't drink ? " " No . I mean . . . that 's not what I 'm here for . I ca n't stay long , and I want to do what I can . It 's going to be hard now that I 'm gone , and I - " Patty put a finger to his lips . " Do n't worry so much about the future , honey . Just let me enjoy the moment .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking his hand in hers and holding it up between them . " Since we 've got the chance to say good-bye , I want us to do it right . " Patty looked at him for a long moment . Then she dropped her gaze . " There is one thing you could do for me . " " What 's that , darlin ' ? " he said quietly . " Well ... I 'll never get to see you again , and ... " She looked up at him and smiled warmly . " Do the dead make love ? " Kyle looked at April but said nothing . He had been silent for some time and wheels were clearly turning in his mind , but she could n't tell what he was thinking . There was something cold growing in his gaze - something like what she thought must be there when he was out hunting mule deer . " What is it ? " she asked . Kyle continued staring silently at her . " No , seriously . What is it ? " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered that . I 'm April 's ghost . " " No , " he said . " No , you 're not . You 're somebody else . I do n't think there is such a thing as a " solid " ghost , and April would never say the things to me that you just did . " " What ? You mean " cause I used the word bitch2 . Believe me , I 'm no stranger to that word . I thought it a lot . I just never said it in front of you . " " I do n't mean that , " Kyle said . " Everyone cusses in their heads , and if April thought Barbara was trying to get me in bed , she might do it out loud - " " You 're damn right ! I do n't want you fuckin " that bitch who pretended to be my friend for years while she was secretly fawning over you ! " " I said I was n't talking about that , " Kyle replied with ice in his voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You said I could n't be faithful to you , that I could n't keep my pants zipped . That ai n't the way April thought - that a man 's so sex-obsessed he ca n't help himself . And she knew from the Bible that marriage is only until death , so it 's no sin to remarry , as far as that thought is from my mind right now . April would never say those things to me , so you 've got ta be a impostor . " Kyle looked down at his naked form and then back up at the fully-dressed woman standing on the opposite side of the bed . " " Scuse me while I get on a robe . " He stood up and opened the door to the closet and produeed a yellow terrycloth bathrobe , which he huffily shrugged on and tied at the waist , keeping his eyes on her the whole time . Then he reached back into the closet and quickly pulled out a battered Winchester M70 rifle . He slammed the bolt forward and pointed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . JACK LAY with his arm around Patty and enjoyed the feeling of relaxed pleasure in his limbs . She had her head tucked up under his chin - something that made him feel good - and she had the fingers of one hand crimped on his chest the way she always did after lovemaking , as if she were clutching his chest hairs . Jack was pleased . He had been the kind of lover he always should have been - gentle , tender , making sure that Patty was satisfied . Now he was slowly brushing her arm with the palm of his hand and occasionally catching a glimpse of his watch to make sure he would n't be late picking up April . Maybe Patty would get pregnant . Jack liked that idea - of finally giving her the child she wanted . He 'd only been gone two weeks . Anybody can miscalculate a pregnancy by two weeks , and the child would look like him . She 'd tell her friends that the baby was a going-away present from Jack , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lost . If it was a boy , maybe she 'd name it after him . His watch began to beep and Jack shut off the noise . " I 'm sorry , darlin ' , I got ta go now . " Patty raised her head and gave him a hurt look . " You ca n't stay any longer ? " " " Fraid not . I tried to arrange more time but could n't . " She studied him and saw he was serious . " Okay , " she said quietly . " Who am I to question the time that heaven gives you . " Then she smiled and whispered , " I 'm just glad we had this much . " Kyle kept the rifle trained on April , and she stared at him angrily . " Pick up that cell phone and slide it to me across the bed , " he said , nodding toward a small silver Nokia that lay on the night table . " What do you think you 're gon na do ? " she asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out who you are . " " I told you - " " I know ! " Kyle shouted . " But you 're not April . I can think of crazy possibilities about what you are . Maybe you 're a demon . Or maybe you 're some damned soul that escaped from hell . Or maybe you 're just the evil twin I never knew April had and you 're trying to play some kind of mind game on me . You sure as hell ai n't April , and given how solid you felt in bed , my money 's on evil twin , so hand me the phone . " She made no move to comply . " Pull the trigger , " she said . Kyle blinked . " I 'm serious . Pull the trigger . You need proof I 'm a ghost , that this is n't a ordinary physical body , you 'll get it . " He did n't move . " I do n't think so , " he said . " I think we 'll just call nine-one-one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not bringing the cops into this . You want proof I 'm a ghost , pull the damn trigger . " Kyle shook his head . She looked at him fiercely . Then she took a step toward the bed and four quick steps through it , wading through the covers and mattress and box springs like they were n't there . Kyle gaped in astonishment . He let his grip on the gun go slack as she stepped directly in front of him , the barrel pointed at her chest : " Then lemme help you , " she said , grabbing the barrel and giving it a sharp jerk directly toward her heart . As she did so , Kyle stepped back and tried to jerk the gun away . Click ! The two of them stood frozen for a moment . " You know I never let you keep that gun loaded in the house , honey . " Jack hugged Patty by the front door and kissed her . " I 'll miss you , " she said . " I 'll pray for you every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something , " he said , releasing his embrace . " Anything . Anything at all . " Jack began fishing in his jacket pocket . " There 's this company called Barton Pharmaceuticals . I want you to take every bit of money you can raise , beg , or borrow and put it into that company 's stock . Stay invested in it for five years . Do n't sell , no matter how much you need the money . Then in five years , sell it all and take the cash . " Kay ? " " I do n't understand . I do n't know how to buy stock . " " It 's okay . Just find a broker in the phone book and call him . He 'll help you do it . That 's what stock brokers are for ... I think . " Jack drew the Dale Earnhardt notepad out of his jacket pocket . " Here , " he said , handing it to her . " I wrote it all down . This is my way of taking care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so Barton should make a killing in the next five years . If you put all the money you can get into it , you 'll make enough to ... well , at least be comfortable , I hope . Maybe better'n comfortable . If you can raise more money later , put that in , too . Anything you can spare , put it into Barton and then pull it all out five years from today . " " How do you know all this ? " He grinned and winked . " Some things ai n't for mortals t'know . " After April called his bluff , Kyle had lapsed back into silence . He was almost catatonic now . She 'd tried to start a conversation , but he just sputtered and shook his head and clamped his hands over his ears . He always did have a way of avoiding things he did n't want to hear , she thought . Just not this physically . April felt a wave of relief when she finally heard Jack blow the taxi 's horn out in the driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm , and gently took his hands away from his ears . " Honey , I got ta go now , but there 's something you need to know . If you do n't believe anything else I 've said , believe this : Your wife made it to heaven . " Kyle blinked . " I ... do n't understand . " " It 's true . That 's what I came here to tell you . The rest has just been me getting in the way . I 'm sorry I could n't put it to you the way April would , but I 'm not her . " " You said - " " No , I 'm not April . I 'm April 's ghost . That 's not the same thing . April 's soul went off to heaven to be with God , and I 'm - I 'm what 's left behind . April was a good woman , but she had flaws like everybody else . She could n't be flawed in God 's presence , so when her soul went to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jealousy - anything bad or even mediocre . She crawled out of them like a butterfly crawls out of its chrysalis . That 's what I am : her chrysalis . " Her face brightened , and a new light came into her eyes . " You should see April now ! I got a glimpse of her just as she was leaving , and she was the most beautiful thing you can imagine . She flapped her wings , and it was like seeing every butterfly , everywhere under the sun . It was like they all flapped their wings - all that color and grace and beauty - all at the same time . " She asked me to tell you she made it , that she 's okay . I almost did n't , " cause I knew I 'd just mess it up . . . which is why I have to leave , too . " She lowered her gaze and looked ashamed . " I 'd only spoil your memory of her . " The taxi 's horn blew again . Jack was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blue and white bungalow opened and April stepped out onto the porch . She closed the door and walked down the steps and straight away from the house , not looking back . Jack could see her bathrobed hubby watching from the window , looking like his world had just been turned inside out . I ca n't blame him , Jack thought . I hope Patty 's doing as well . Behind him there was a Match and a squeak and a bounce and a slam . He backed out of the driveway and drove noiselessly up the street . When he turned onto Alvarado , he said , " So how did it go ? " " Not as good as it could have . " " Well , you expected that . Did you tell him that he does n't have to worry - that your soul made it to God and you 're just what 's left behind ? " " Yeah . " " Did he believe you ? " " I hope so . " After a few moments of silence April squirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front seat . " How " bout you ? I assume you did n't tell your wife why you 're Mr. Wonderful all of a sudden - why you 're all her husband 's good points with none of the bad . " Jack kept his eyes fixed on the road ahead . " Not on your fife . "
