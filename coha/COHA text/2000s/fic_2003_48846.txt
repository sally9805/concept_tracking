A ROW OF TINY BEADS OF BLOOD had formed between Pansy 's thumb and forefinger , but her mother and father were in such a hurry and there was so much that had to be done with the new Pierce  --  Arrow touring car simply to start it that neither stopped to take care of the scratch or even knew about it . And what difference would it make , she thought , remembering the kitten who had repulsed her good-bye kiss and been responsible , for her mother would cause a commotion over it , and her father-in his ponderous way-would only insist on explaining how blood clotted . He had released the clutch and the three of them-with a succession of irregular chugs and lurchings-were moving away from the house . Pansy carefully licked the tiny , drying beads from her hand as if she had discovered a last bit of cream on the back of a silver spoon and she were an heiress , which she was , in a way , being an only child . The taste of iron on her tongue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly delicious . <p> She was to be put on the train , then ride three stops down the line before getting off at Monroe , where she would spend the night with her grandparents . This was a thing she had never before been allowed . Her mother was particularly protective of her , and her father was not entirely in agreement with it . Grandfather Taylor was a doctor also , a man who had a gruffness about him that had wounded his son more than once . Grandmother Taylor was a woman both ardent and ineffectual . That was all her father would say about it , for he was trying to steer around a squirrel who sat tensely in the middle of the muddy road holding a nut . <p> " Who can blame your mother for wanting to do nothing but tell brave stories and stay in the past ? " his wife said . " Your father discourages her going out of the house and wo n't tolerate a word in his presence . " Her hand went to the dashboard as the motorcar abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father answered vaguely as if trying to remember some particular incident that he might use as example but would rather forget . In truth , he was wondering if he should have looked over his manuscript one more time before giving it to the printer . Three hundred and fifty copies of a pamphlet , The Viscosity of Blood in Human Capillary Function , that were to be handed out before his evening address on the same subject at Richmond Medical College , rested in a heavy suitcase on the back seat next to his daughter . <p> Pansy 's mother , in anticipation of Faulkner and Warriner 's , her favorite Richmond department store , had penciled her daughter 's measurements on a sheet of lined paper that was now carefully folded in her purse : the length of the girl 's tender feet for dancing slippers , the circumference of her head for a new cloche hat , the nape of her neck to her waist between the delicate shoulder blades , and then a decorous six inches from the floor . And Pansy had expressly said that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow , so that her mother might embroider a design of pansies down both sides of the bodice , for though no one would have dared mention it , she did not mind , in the least , having a floral design of gentle embroidery to decorously set off her newly feminine chest . <p> " I do n't want my daughter associated with it , " Pansy 's father said out of the blue , holding tight to the steering wheel as his eyes stared at the road and seemed , to his wife , to contract . <p> " Your mother promised it was a thing of the past and I believe her , " she said . " Men soften with age and their interests change , you know that . " <p> " Associated with what , Father ? " Pansy asked . <p> " What a beautiful day , " her mother said . " I swear it makes me feel like a girl again just to see the distances so fresh and washed . " <p> And it did seem , when Pansy looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped into each gleaming surface , and that the world belonged solely to her and no one else . The shacks of Freetown with its Negroes and its tannery smelling of vinegar , its proud , ramshackle church , the rolling , stubbled fields beyond , and the long divide of blue mountains always present in the distance were familiar in a way that she could not express . If she had been given only one piece of it in a parlor puzzle-just the barest glimpse or inch of it-she would have known exactly where the questioned piece should be set . Then , suddenly , gazing at a line of trees demarcating a field , everything she had ever known or seen was eclipsed by a sweet gum with leaves red as Chinese velvet . <p> All this stayed in her mind as she boarded the train and an elderly lady with the heavy scent of lavender sat carefully down on the seat beside her , stayed in her mind in pleasant and comforting thought as the train made its first stop and the elderly lady , now asleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her , bought a paper-wrapped parcel of fried chicken through the open train window from a colored woman with a huge round tray miraculously balanced on her head , her nut-colored hand reaching for its coin towards the train window . <p> And yes , the decrepit colored man , Charles , was sitting in the buckboard and waiting to meet her at the Monroe station , and Grandmother Taylor was just as Pansy remembered when they arrived at the old Georgian house , a perennial anxiety hovering about her as if-as Pansy 's father always said-someone upstairs were about to give birth . Yet , as always , she said almost nothing in Grandfather Taylor 's presence . At dinner she ate in the European manner , fork in her left hand , knife in her right . For each bite she piled a bit of goose , then potato , then a piece of green bean upon the back of her fork , none of it ever slipping off . Small , uncontrolled nods winked from her eyes between the flickering candles , while Grandfather Taylor ate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face a contradiction to his hands , for his fingers seemed so gentle as Pansy watched them curl around the stem of his claret glass . <p> " I do hope you 'll excuse me , " he said , rising to a stand . " You 've grown into a lovely young woman . Has n't she , my dear ? " he said to his wife , and Pansy 's grandmother nodded in rapid , warm compliance . <p> " Where is Charles ? Why is he never here when I want him ? " he asked curtly from the hall . <p> Then the front door closed behind him and all was quiet before her grandmother felt the freedom to talk . " Surely , " she said , as if the subject had direct relevance to the present , " your studies at the Piedmont Female Institute have taught you the history of Commodore Macdonough 's victory over the British on Lake Champlain ? " <p> Pansy shook her head and said they had not . <p> " When I was in school , " her grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of course , but then that was before the war . Now no one wants to mention the North . " <p> " People do all the time , " Pansy said . <p> " Do ? Do what my dear ? " <p> " Mention the North , and go there , too . It 's the thing to do now . " <p> " I do n't see why it should be , " Grandmother Taylor said , her rigid torso encased in black silk . " I was about to tell you about the battle of Lake Champlain . " <p> She paused to observe Pansy 's reaction , and saw that it was positive . <p> " Well , you can imagine that dear Commodore Macdonough was at sixes and sevens . His ship was in splinters and half the crew had been killed . The flag was dark with soot . The sails hung in tatters , and yes ; hard as it was for the dear man to believe , a cannonball had torn the great towering mast completely in half . Imagine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dead compatriots rolling on top of you with every wave and pitch , and you not the strength to even open your mouth in protest . " <p> She stared hard at Pansy , whose eyes were now wide with question . <p> " No , " she said , " I do n't suppose you can . Not having been in that position , of course . But , I grant you , if you had been one of those sailors you would have felt with your own hands how greasy and slick blood can be when it 's spilled on the deck of a ship . " <p> " Yes ? " Pansy asked , her eyes now exacting and urgent . <p> " Well , " her grandmother said , in a satisfied voice , " well , perhaps I 've misjudged and you can imagine it . " Then she added with a flourish , " And vomit ! Of course I know it 's not pleasant to talk about , especially during meals , but why not speak the truth ? Why go through life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Then , before Pansy could abstract herself from the bloody decks of the battered ship and think of a response , her grandmother said , " Of course the dear commodore was beside himself . Would n't you be ? " she asked . " A half-dead sailor lifted his arm to protest and-what do you think ? " <p> Pansy shook her head . <p> " He had no hand . It had been blown off ! " Grandmother Taylor lifted her own ringed hand with a look of disbelief as if it were suddenly absent . <p> Cinda , the colored girl dressed all in white , stood waiting in the shadows with a bowl of charlotte . <p> " ' Hark ! ' the commodore cried . ' Hark ! " Grandmother Taylor 's face turned suddenly fresh and taut . " He was the first to hear , of course , his hearing being acute and sharp as all the dear man 's faculties were , both mental and physical . He was the first to hear the chanticleer voice of the gamecock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird had escaped . He was singing to all creation as he perched on the broken mast . " <p> Grandmother Taylor listened to the far-off sounds of the cock . <p> " The men heard the cock crow , and they knew what they must do . ' He was crowing his own bravery out to them . He was directing them to stand up and take arms . For everyone knows that the need for battle rages in every rooster 's blood . " <p> She beat her silk-covered chest with a furious clenched fist , not once but twice , then stood up and drew a sword of air from its scabbard , causing an ornament in her gray hair to tremble . <p> " And so they rose to a stand , " she said , " all that were alive and had breath . And the fight was won , " she declared , in a ringing , ardent voice , " all by the spirit of a cock ! " <p> Cinda served the charlotte while Grandmother Taylor sat down and helped herself , explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraved with the Taylor crest . The candelabra was a replica of a set now in the British Museum but originally found at Pompeii and copied with special permission as a wedding present to Pansy 's great-grandmother . <p> " Each of those Copeland plates contains a scene from classical antiquity . " She indicated a stack of plates upon the sideboard with a number of small nods . " When we 're through with our charlotte I 'll show them to you . " They stood up , finally , and left the table , and the old woman said , as she lifted one plate and then another , " Herculaneum , you see , precisely like the one you ate your dinner on . The Parthenon . And Ephesus . And there , the great obelisk at Luxor carved with hieroglyphics . Tintern Abbey . And look , my dear , here are the regal columns of Persepolis . And there , you see that engraving on the wall ? It 's The Maid of Saragossa , standing on a headland in the wind . She has assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he has been killed . " <p> So that later , as Pansy lay upstairs in bed in the dark and heard the clock in the hall chime out ten o'clock , she saw everything with a kind of awed density mixed with excitement , but also pain , for it seemed to her that the world connected with her own blood ties betrayed something much wider than she had thought . Eating one 's goose on the fallen stones of Herculaneum served as only the briefest of hints , for it seemed that the world had been hidden from view , like a tree behind a veil . No , not a tree exactly , but something much less defined and infinitely more exciting and precious . It seemed to her that Commodore Macdonough 's victory over the British and the stones of Herculaneum , buried under the cooked flesh of a goose , would always be with her , engraved upon memory for all time , a fragment of her own collected history to be used years later as evidence . But evidence towards what ? she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But surely evidence , for she was at that age when a new idea would suddenly assail her , an idea that seemed so memorable and original and fresh that she was certain it had never been thought of by anyone else . If I could hold one thing in the palm of my hand , what would it be ? she asked herself . <p> She was climbing over the fallen stones of Herculaneum in the hot sun as she lay in bed , when she heard the sound of motorcars , the bumping sound of wagons interspersed . Headlights filtered through the voile curtains , then swung in an arc against the wallpaper , then faded into the dark . Then another sweep of light and then another , each disappearing . She slipped from between the sheets of the four-poster , went to the window , and opened the casement . The night was still , but breathing , yes , she could feel it , breathing and attentive , but absolutely quiet . She listened hard , but the only thing she heard was her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to turn from the window and slip back into bed when she saw the headlights of two more motorcars sweeping down the drive . The sound of their engines reminded her of a man with a handkerchief muffling his cough and pretending not to be consumptive . Another set of headlights appeared and then another , then two wagons , all moving towards , then turning away from , the house . The moon gleamed with unabashed prominence , focused its rays on the occupants of yet another wagon , a man and woman whose furtive , shadowed forms implied they were traveling on foreign soil without duty or passport . <p> She saw her grandmother , who she had thought was surely in bed , walk between the portico 's columns and proceed down the steps . Then Cinda , the colored girl , appeared on the steps beside Grandmother Taylor , the one Negro figure straight and tall and dressed in white , the figure of her grandmother heavier and slightly bent , dressed in black . <p> " Well , they have a good night for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two figures turned to go inside and another wagon disappeared into the dark . <p> I will only look , she told herself as she began to dress . Whatever it is , I will only look , and there can be no harm in that , she said to herself as she put on her dress and shoes , coat and wide-brim straw hat . <p> The columned portico gleamed white as she moved across the lawn away from it . The roof line and chimneys rose in silent delineation against the night sky . The lamps that guarded the front door had been turned off . Perhaps Grandfather Taylor was gone for the night and not expected back . The moon was full and round , larger than itself , and she suddenly feared what might be on the other side of it , the side turned like a malefactor towards the dark . The overgrown boxwood cast bulbous shadows against the lawn , the grass between was slivers of mercury spilled from a vial . <p> The barns were some distance from the house , down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never flat . A board bridge traversed a run trickling with glints of white and silver . Half-heard voices echoed in the distance , pulling her forward , while ahead , a grove of trees changed position , first presenting a tight dark cluster , then slowly opening and spreading apart so that the road to the barns was now seen as a series of soft processional glows where rainwater sat in ridged puddles and ruts . <p> Behind her came another set of lights , quick and urgent , swinging down the drive and brushing the hem of her dress as she stepped away from the road and into the dark , the driver a man with his shirt sleeves rolled up , an elbow hanging out the window , a long , eager face that in profile looked as if he 'd give up his whole future for what might come to pass in the next few minutes . A child pleaded , " Are we there , Pop ? " But she hardly had time to wonder , for up ahead she could see the gasoline lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gleams from the parked cars and wagons . <p> Companionable and sharp , ribald , demanding and jovial , the deep voices of the men , the lighter sounds of women and children were an object on the night , a shape of sound that rose and dispersed , then welled again with the smoke of cigarettes , the odor of beer and whiskey . A shape of sound that took in the latticed wood cages stacked by the cars , the startling chanticleer sound of roosters and their softer watery clucks . <p> She saw her grandfather heated with argument standing in the moth  --  filled light by the huge barn door , recognized his vexed expression behind his cigar as he talked to a man with a long , peaked face , the man she had seen with a child pass down the road in his car , a man who held under his arm-and stroked without stopping-a magnificent Black Devil , a thing not incidental to him at all , but like his own arm , fully loved and trusted and admonished . <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandfather Taylor . " I say you keep your hands on him too long . It 's what I notice is all . He thinks you 're there to protect him . Leave him be once in a while . " <p> The rooster , his eyes flecked with flashes of brown and yellow , held steady in the handler 's grasp . <p> " I 'm the best handler in the barn tonight , you know that yourself . I can spot a strike before anyone else . How many mains I won for you , Doc ? Answer me that . " <p> The man , small and sure and unafraid , never let his hand up off the bird , but stroked the sleek feathers with deft assurance , always sizing the bird up , always imparting , through the power of his hand , something unexplained and ancient . It was clear that he loved the rooster not just as wages to take home and get through the season with , but to be a part of-and yes , even that , Pansy suddenly thought-to love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Doctor Taylor said . " He do n't enjoy it . Yes , he 's a close hitter , I 'll grant you that , but he only fights to protect his organs of sex . He has the essentials , as every man that 's worth the name does , but a good chicken kills because he loves the killing , he 's game to it . " <p> " The Gray 's a poor marksman , " the handler said , stroking the bird firm and easy from his hackles to his rump . " And he bill-holds . Everyone that 's seen him fight says it . " <p> " Every Derby Gray I ever seen was game to the death , " Doctor Taylor contradicted . <p> The sleek dart of the Black Devil 's head , whose wattles and comb had been severed away , rose tense above his body like a hard , feathered arrow . <p> " He came through at Orlando when he was almost down , he did good at Charleston and Biloxi , and he 'll come through tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have to see , wo n't we ? We 'll just wait and set and see , wo n't we now ? Because he 's a year older than he was . " <p> Grandfather Taylor clicked open a small black box that he had withdrawn from his pocket , and gave the handler a pair of finger-long , needle-thin spurs . <p> " It 's about time you was to heel him up , " he said . <p> They moved into the barn , and Pansy , staying at a distance , followed . Her wide-brim straw hat was suddenly knocked off and trampled , but she hardly noticed in the crush of men jockeying for position near the pit , the barn smelling of cigarettes and hay , cows and manure and sweat , the women laughing and children darting about , the colored man , Charles , making his awkward way through the crowd as he handed out sandwiches from a basket . <p> Pansy watched the two birds weighed and gaffs examined . She could see that her grandfather 's Black Devil had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting steady in the handler 's arms and loving every moment of this prelude to battle . She saw the gleaming African Negro color of his feathers all clipped , his tail and wings trimmed so that no sickle feathers remained , his natural spurs sawed off , and one gleaming gaff , laced and strapped to the back of each heel . <p> " Get ready ! " the referee announced , and the barn turned silent . <p> The two handlers held their birds and brought them together in midair . The birds ' hackles went up , great fluffy collars poised around their necks . Their eyes gleamed , and then the sound of a click in the still barn as their beaks met , and the crowd , half lit by the gasoline light over the center of the ring , began to place their bets . <p> " Pit ! " called the referee , and the birds were lowered squarely on their feet to the ground of the pit . <p> The Black Devil stood there for one silent second , his head erect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing out the sheen of his coat . Then the two birds became-all of a sudden-one piece , wings and tails mixed . The Gray rose into the air in a tempest of angry aggression and lunged for a beak hold . The Black beat him off with a wing , then rose above the Gray and shot out a brain blow with his spurred heel , but it seemed to Pansy , as she inched her way towards the ring , that the Black 's attempt fell short . A cloud of floating feathers startled in a gust of air as the four wings splayed out again in a burst of fans and the Gray lunged for another beak hold . The Black was , now , exploding and violent , no longer cowed but wide-winged and defiant and spectacular  --  sinking a gaff into the Gray 's scalp . The Gray reared back on his tail , and the gaff came loose from his scalp as he grabbed a mouthful of throat and sank both his gaffs into the Black . The Black Devil was hung , trembling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breast . <p> " Handle ! " the referee called . <p> Pansy stood stock-still as the Black 's handler stayed the bird and carefully slid out the gaffs , then brought the bird up to his chest and stroked him with a sure hand . A feather was caught in the bird 's mouth , and Pansy suddenly wanted to yell to the handler to take it out . But the handler seemed to know simply by her thinking it , as he held the Black steady between his arm and chest and picked the feather from the bird 's bill , his face even and withdrawn from everything but the bird . Only the weight of his hand on the bird 's back and the tremble of his fingers on the feathers betrayed a sense of hurt . <p> " Pitt " the referee called , and Pansy saw the birds lowered again into the pit . <p> The Gray , wings splayed and magnificent , rose into the air and again Pansy felt she ought to yell out , ought to warn the Black as the Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed quiet . Not from propriety or any fear of being recognized , but simply because she did not want to break the spell . <p> " Handle ! " came the call . <p> And she saw that one of the Gray 's gaffs was caught in the Black 's eye while the other was caught in his neck . Immediately , the Gray 's handler bent to touch the hung birds . <p> " Touch that steel and I 'll kill youl " the Black 's handler said , beating the referee to it . <p> For a moment the two men stared hard at each other . Then the Gray 's handler withdrew his hand and the Black 's slid the gaffs from the flesh , lifted the Black from the pit , and , with trembling hands , took him to his chest . He placed his mouth on the bird 's eye , sucked the blood from the wound and spit it out , and the Black choked with a terrible , grating caw , flung back his head and beaded the handler 's white shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black 's eyeball hung down by a sinew from its socket . Yet his other eye was sharp and defiant . <p> " Pit ! " <p> And the birds were lowered . There was no separation now , no distance or air , no difference between her and the handler and the Black . <p> The Black 's one eye flashed and his wings beat the air . The Gray rose majestically , his gaffs up and poised , and lanced a blow into the Black 's spine , and the Black was coupled , his legs were in paralysis . No part of him moved but his arrow-sharp head and one good wing that continued to flail the air . <p> " Handle ! " <p> The Black 's handler lifted him with both hands and forced his own warm breath down into the bird 's feathers , took a sponge from a pail , and let the water carefully drip over the bird 's vent as the bird 's one good wing rose and strained , for he was still alive and the game was not over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered to the pit floor , where the Gray delivered a final blow with his gaffs to the Black , then stood stiff and proud , circling and pecking at the corpse . <p> Another pair of birds and handlers took their place , yet Pansy had eyes for nothing but the Black , whose handler now walked out of the barn dangling the bird by his neck as if he were a sack . He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of a hand , then walked to the corner of the barn and tossed the bird into the dark . <p> " Custis ! " he called out . " Custis ! You there ? " <p> A small boy appeared . <p> " You ready , Pop ? Did you win , Pop ? " <p> But the handler said nothing and the boy knew not to ask as the two of them climbed into the car . The handler took a swig from a bottle , lit a cigarette , sighed deeply with both hands pushing back from the wheel , his arms stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddance , son of a sailor , " Doctor Taylor said as he stood in the barn door and looked off into the night . " The spineless chicken and him together . " <p> " Handle ! " came the call from inside the barn , and Grandfather Taylor , with a look of interest , turned back into the glowing interior . <p> The ground was damp and cold , moist with night dew that seemed to seep from it like sweat . For a moment , on hands and knees , prowling through the field and feeling , always feeling for the bird with her hands , she was no longer an awkward girl , but a lithe red fox , no longer caring if her dress or her stockings or underclothes were stained with dirt , the red clay that never came out of cloth . Now , she thought , as she searched the rough clods , the clay is the same , the very same color of my fur if I am , in fact , a fox , and she knew why a fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with time only the color of cream , white and soft . <p> The bird was an elegant thing , a startling achievement , when she laid her hand upon it , a pillow of feathered , sleek silk . In her lap , the dead weight of a new sleeping babe , but not a babe at all , of course , but a thing lifeless and barely warm , no longer a series of small arrogant hitching motions or gleaming eyes surveying the world , but a thing of no consequence . She stroked him and felt his hard , open beak with her fingertips , the sticky eye hole that now accommodated her fingertip , the gaffs that the handler had not thought to return to her grandfather and that now caught in the wool of her coat . The moon above was a silver face with unreadable eyes and an immovable , round-cheeked smile , a cunning smile , distant and secure . She stroked the bird like an afterthought , then laid him on the ground where she had found him . <p> She walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stairs , took off her coat and hung it up , slipped off her shoes , then stripped off her clothes and wrapped them in a bundle , then climbed into bed . She slept deep and still without a dream to remember through the morning of the next day and into early afternoon , before finally getting up and hiding yesterday 's clothes in her bag , bathing , dressing in clean ones , and making her way downstairs . <p> No one was in the front sitting room , nor the rear . No one was in her grandfather 's office built on to the side of the house , though she knocked and then pushed open the door and stepped across the threshold . Only Cinda , who interrupted her to say that Doctor Taylor was making his patient visits and Grandmother Taylor was taking her afternoon slumber , but if she was hungry there were eggs and biscuits and scrapple or whatever might appeal , and Pansy suddenly saw , crowning the disorder of papers on her grandfather 's desk , her own forgotten wide-brim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusing finger straight at her . <p> Not until Grandmother Taylor came down from upstairs to kiss her good-bye and she was on her way , coat buttoned and straw hat perched awkwardly on the top of her head , and the train had begun to move away from Monroe , and Charles had driven off , did she feel completely safe in removing the purloined catalogue from her bag in order to take a good , long , loving look at its stain-wrinkled blue cover .
