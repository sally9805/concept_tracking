It was hockey on a Brobdingnagian scale , an oversized , readymade epic . Last Saturday night at Spartan Stadium , Michigan State and Michigan , two powerhouses , played to a 3-3 tie before 74,554 fans , the largest crowd in hockey history . ( The previous largest attendance , 55,000 , was for a Sweden- U.S.S.R. match at Lenin Stadium in Moscow in 1957 . ) The 238th game of this 79-year-old rivalry took place on a sheet of ice laid between the 18-yard lines of the Spartans ' football field . Inauspiciously billed THE COLD WAR , it ended in a stalemate after 65 chippy minutes . The game did n't resolve which school deserved the state 's bragging rights , but it did reinforce the belief that both teams will contend for the NCAA title . // The crowd , which was more than 10 times larger than the capacity at Munn Ice Arena , Michigan State 's usual home , got its money 's worth : There was Wolverines junior Mike Cammalleri scoring twice , the first on a breakaway against 2001 Hobey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Spartans freshman forward Jim Slater banging home the tying goal from the slot with only 47 seconds remaining and the Michigan State net empty . " Awesome , " said Michigan coach Red Berenson , who 's in his 18th season with the Wolverines . " Two top teams , the fans . I thought I 'd seen everything in hockey , but this was incredible . " // Although it needed that late goal to salvage a tie , Michigan State , which lost in last year 's NCAA semifinals to North Dakota , is still the favorite to win the Frozen Four . Built around Miller  --  last season he was 31-5-4 with a 1.32 goals-against average and a .950 save percentage , the last being a single-season NCAA record  --  the Spartans allowed 1.36 goals per game , fewest in the nation . Moreover , Michigan State 's four top defensemen are back ; the pairings of seniors Andrew Hutchinson and Jon Insana and juniors Brad Fast and John-Michael Liles combined for 81 points and were +71 . Three of the Spartans ' six leading scorers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 23 assists ) and Adam Hall ( 18 , 12 ) will provide more than enough punch for this stingy bunch . Michigan State will go as far as Miller takes it , and he 's championship material . // Miller 's counterpart at Michigan , senior and four-year starter Josh Blackburn , is no slouch . His 2.29 goals-against average last season was second in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association ( CCHA ) to Miller 's , and his nine career shutouts are two shy of the Wolverines ' record . Sophomore Mike Komisarek ( 16 points , +17 ) , who was selected seventh by the Montreal Canadiens in June 's NHL draft , is the backbone of the blueliners . Make no mistake , though , Michigan will make its living on offense , which is led by Cammalleri ( 29 , 32 ) , who should thrive on Berenson 's top line between newcomer Jason Ryznar and junior Jed Ortmeyer . " Ryznar might be a freshman , but he plays like a senior , " says Cammalleri . " On my second goal he noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puck there real soft , so all I had to do was shovel it in . " Strong freshman classes are Berenson 's trademark , and it will only take one or two rookie breakouts for the Wolverines to challenge the Spartans for the CCHA championship . // Here are the other top 10 teams , listed in descending order . // The Western Collegiate Hockey Association ( WCHA ) is the nation 's deepest conference  --  last season it sent a record five schools to the 12-team NCAA tournament  --  and if preseason favorite Colorado College can withstand the bump-and-grind of league play , it will lead the charge back to the Frozen Four . Hobey Baker shortlisters Mark Cullen ( 20 goals ) , a senior , and Peter Sejna ( 29 ) , a sophomore , each scored 50 points last season on coach Scott Owens 's No. 1 line . Ten of the Tigers ' top 12 scorers , who accounted for 77% of Colorado College 's goals , are back . Senior goalie Jeff Sanger holds Tigers career records for wins ( 55 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working behind a defense that may have as many as three freshmen playing regularly . " The one area in which we may be suspect is on defense , " says Owens . " We 'll rely heavily on Jeff until those freshmen adjust to the quicker pace of the college game . " // At Minnesota , third-year coach Don Lucia , a crack recruiter , also has demonstrated a facility for getting the most from his touted freshmen : The Gophers ' 2000-01 rookie class was No. 1 among all freshman classes in scoring , with 52 goals and 65 assists . Winger Grant Potulny had a pair of power-play goals in his second game and never looked back . He led the NCAA with 16 man-advantage goals on a unit that converted an impressive 25.4% of its opportunities . Classmates Troy Riddle ( 16 , 14 ) and Matt Koalska ( 10 , 14 ) joined Potulny on the WCHA All-Rookie team , while another freshman , Jon Waibel , helped the penalty-killing unit ring up an 88.5% success rate . Minnesota 's linchpin , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan Leopold , an offensive-minded blueliner who came to Minneapolis under Lucia 's predecessor , had 49 points last season , tying North Dakota 's Travis Roche , who 's playing for the Minnesota Wild farm team in Houston this season , for the most among college defensemen. // The blue line crew at Providence in 2000-01 was among the best in Friars history . It helped produce a 2.70 goals-against average , the lowest in the 49 seasons of hockey at Providence . That unit , which again will play in front of stalwart junior goaltender Nolan Schaefer , returns virtually intact and will be bolstered by the addition of two standouts from the New England Junior Coyotes of the Eastern Junior Hockey League ( EJHL ) : Jeff Mason and Eric Lundberg . Mason was named the EJHL 's top defenseman after scoring 55 points in 54 games . Junior center Devin Rask , Hockey East 's leading returning scorer ( 23 , 28 ) , leads a deep group of forwards that features six 25-point scorers , including junior Jon DiSalvatore , who had six goals for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending national champ Boston College decimated by losses to graduation and the NHL , traditionally hard-hitting Hockey East is uncommonly weak . Only two teams besides Providence  --  Maine and New Hampshire  --  appear to have any chance of making the NCAA tournament . // North Dakota 's glittering new $100 million Ralph Engelstad Arena generated controversy ( SI , Oct. 8 ) in the off-season , but what the Fighting Sioux , the NCAA runners-up last year , lost over the summer deserves pub as well  --  forward Jeff Panzer ( 26 , 55 ) , the nation 's leading scorer ; goaltender Karl Goehring ( 16-6-6 , .918 save percentage ) ; and Trevor Hammer , a four-year starting defenseman , all left , while forward Bryan Lundbohm ( 69 points , second in the nation ) and defenseman Travis Roche left North Dakota for the farm teams of the Nashville Predators and the Wild , respectively . " We lose great players every year , " says senior captain Chad Mazurak , a defenseman . " We have a lot of new faces , and it will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be fine after that . " // The Fighting Sioux , winners of four of the last five WCHA regular-season titles , will lean on Mazurak and senior defenseman Aaron Schneekloth . A question mark will be goalie Andy Kollar , who was 13-2-3 as Goehring 's backup last year but who has n't been tested on a regular basis . // The season opens under a pall at Maine because of the Sept. 24 death of coach Shawn Walsh , 46 , from renal cell carcinoma . In 17 seasons with the Black Bears , Walsh was 399-214-44 and produced two national championships ( 1993 and ' 99 ) and two Hobey Baker winners ( Scott Pellerin in ' 92 and Paul Kariya in ' 93 ) . Tim Whitehead , an assistant under Walsh in ' 90-91 , was brought back last month after having coached UMass-Lowell for the past five years . Whitehead will benefit from a soft early schedule : Maine does n't play a Hockey East opponent with a winning conference record until it meets New Hampshire on Dec. 1 . Winger Martin Kariya ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorer and third in the line of Kariya brothers in Orono , is the offensive key . // The third in another band of brothers , Harvard 's Dominic Moore , is the reason the Crimson , 16-15-2 a year ago , will bust into the top 10 . Dominic , a junior play-making center who followed brothers Mark and Steve to Cambridge , is on the verge of blossoming into the best forward in the Eastern College Athletic Conference ( ECAC ) after leading Harvard in scoring with 15 goals and 28 assists in 2000-01 . Moore is the centerpiece of third-year coach Mark Mazzoleni 's rebuilding project . His strong recruiting paid dividends last season when the Crimson had its first .500-plus record in seven years . Goaltending is a concern for Harvard , which lost the conference 's best netminder , Oliver Jonas ( .915 save percentage ) , to graduation . Sophomore Will Crothers , junior Ben Weiss and freshman Dov Grumet-Morris , who have only 80 minutes of college experience among them , will compete for the starting job . // There 's no such concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( .928 save percentage , 1.88 goals-against ) is second only to Michigan State 's Miller among the nation 's keepers . As with any club built around a superior goalie , the Big Red thinks defense first ; last year its 2.18 goals-allowed average and 90.3% penalty-kill rate were both second in the nation behind the Spartans . All 10 of Cornell 's top scorers are back , and coach Mike Schafer believes his team , which was not included among the top 15 clubs in the USA Today/American Hockey Magazine preseason poll , is underappreciated . " It 's disappointing , " Schafer says of the omission , " but we can use that as motivation . We 'll have to earn respect as the season goes on . " // While it 's not in Michigan State 's or Michigan 's league , Nebraska-Omaha , beginning only its fifth year of hockey , is a clear No. 3 in the CCHA . The Mavericks ' four leading scorers from a year ago , including junior captain David Brisson ( 22 , 25 ) and senior winger Jeff Hoggan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve its power play , which converted only 15.2% of its chances last season , though All-America junior defenseman Greg Zanon did his part by leading the Mavericks with eight power-play goals . The special teams ' flip side remains strong  --  Nebraska- Omaha 's penalty killers ranked 10th in the nation  --  and goalie Dan Ellis , who made the CCHA All-Rookie team last season , set school records for wins ( 21 likely to challenge for the conference 's top two spots , they must avoid careless play on the road to lock up third place . Last season Nebraska-Omaha was 1-7 in its first eight away games , which included getting swept at less-than-stellar opponents Lake Superior State and Merrimack. // If the Michigan-Michigan State game presaged the rest of the season , it will be a larger-than-life year . As for a Wolverines-Spartans rematch in the Frozen Four , history teaches that cold war clashes tend to flare up again and again .
