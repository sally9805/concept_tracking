His game is steady , but he lacks the palpable blood thirst of Sergio Garcia , the polished grace of Adam Scott or the wayward wackiness of Ian Poulter . Donald , who paints as a pastime , is a more subdued pastel to the primary-color boldness of his peers . Currently ranked 13th in the world , Donald 's rise has been steady if unspectacular . The upside to that is there 's potential for a sudden explosion of dramatic fireworks , and the affable Chicago-based Brit has everything he needs to make that happen . So do you feel like the " potential " period is over and now it 's time to win a major ? Absolutely . I 've had four years out here . My goals are n't just to show up and have a good week . I want to win . I might not be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be the best . You averaged 284.5 yards per drive in 2005 , yet some people insist you 're a short hitter . Does that rub you the wrong way ? Some of people brand me as a short hitter . I do n't think I 'm short . I 'm average on Tour . When I 'm swinging well , I can hold my own against most players who would n't be considered short . No player likes to be called short . I got tagged as a short hitter , and I do n't think that 's true . How did it feel to play with Jack Nicklaus at St. Andrews in the final major championship round of his career , with Tom Watson no less ? It was a great thrill and a great honor . What was your initial reaction to hearing the news ? I thought , " Wow , this is going to be hard in a way with the crowds and the media attention around me . To be a part of what might be Jack 's last few rounds , I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was going to be hard . Was it tough to stay focused when it would 've been easy to fall into the role of a fan ? I was a bit nervous the first couple of holes during the first round . But I knew both gentlemen reasonably well . They 're both very easygoing on the course . The first round felt like we were playing a late Sunday afternoon round together , just having fun . There just happened to be 100,000 people watching us . I felt very relaxed with those two guys . I did n't feel like I was competing against them , even though they both made birdie on the first hole . I was like , " Wow , these guys came to play . " Did you come close to losing it ? Sure . There was so much emotion out there . I started to well up a little bit and held it back . Those last two holes , 17 and 18 , were very tough . The roars got louder and the crowds kept building and building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the players on the surrounding greens were watching . It probably took 35 or 40 minutes to finish . Tell us about the pressure of playing in the Ryder Cup in 2004 . That first tee shot is built up so much , you ca n't help but be nervous . I got up there and I felt pretty good . Then I stuck the tee in the ground and that 's when it hit me . I started shaking a little bit . I tried to concentrate , but I got my legs way ahead of me and the club behind me , and I nearly hit it onto the ninth tee . Probably one of the worst drives I 've ever hit on the first hole of any round . My partner , Paul McGinley , made par . I was just short of the green in 4 . I made a solid 6 laughs . Was there late-night celebrating after that victory ? Yes . We frequented a couple of Irish bars , mixed with the Irish supporters who came out . I think Darren Clarke had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed for a couple of days after that . You and Sergio went 2-0 in foursomes . Why do you make a good partnership ? We get on really well . He 's good at relaxing me , making everything lighthearted . I never felt pressure playing with Sergio . That 's part of the reason we played so well . If you played for the American team , who 's the guy you 'd least like to play against ? Sergio . He gets up so much for the Ryder Cup . He does n't want to lose . How did a golf ace from England end up at Northwestern , not exactly a sports powerhouse ? I knew I wanted to come to a university in America , and I was recruited heavily by Stanford . I did n't get into Stanford , and I was a little upset about it . Stanford coach Wally Goodwin felt bad , and he pointed me toward Northwestern . I went for a visit , met coach Pat Goss , saw the courses they played on , and really enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit and there was still some snow on the ground , but in the end it worked out the best . Pat must have made quite an impression on you since he 's still your swing coach today . He 's so easy to get on with . He made me feel relaxed from the get-go . After I turned pro , it was an easy decision for me . He knew my swing really well , and I felt like everything we worked on was the right stuff . Were you a frat boy in college ? I joined the winter of my freshman year . Lived in a frat house for two years . I was lucky because I was on the golf team and practiced all afternoon . I was n't too wild . Just occasionally . But it was fun . I met a lot of great guys there . Is it true that you were once bitten by a fraternity snake ? What is Pat doing to me ? Laughs I was over at one of my frat brother 's apartments on a Friday night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake that he kept in his apartment . A boa constrictor , probably 6 or 7 feet long . Pretty thick . He took it out just to show it to everyone and hung it around his neck . I was intrigued so I went up to him and asked him if it was OK to touch it . I went to pet the snake , and it just saw my hand and went for it , bit me right across the first two fingers of my left hand . A quick bite and off . The owner said , " Well , he has n't eaten anything in two weeks and I guess he thought your hand was food . " I was like , " Thanks for telling me that now . " And , actually , a snake 's teeth come out when they bite , so they stayed in my hand . I had to go to the hospital the next morning to get them removed . One was so deep that it 's still in my hand , in the middle crease of my forefinger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art major and are still a pretty fair painter . How did you get into painting ? My older brother and sister were good at art in high school , and I picked up on it in high school , too . I was reasonably good at it , enjoyed it , and thought it was better than sitting in a chemistry lab or working on math problems . After college , you bought a place in Evanston , Ill . Why did you decide to live near Chicago when most Tour players plunk down in warmer spots like Orlando , West Palm or Scottsdale ? There were a lot of factors . Obviously , Pat Goss was there . I met my girlfriend Diane there , and I felt comfortable in Chicago . It 's a great city to go out and have fun . Are you a big Cubs fan ? I enjoy going out there , having a beer , relaxing . Wrigley 's a pretty special place . Great atmosphere . You were supposed to sing " Take Me Out to the Ballgame " at Wrigley Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? It was the right decision to postpone the game . In a way I was relieved I did n't have to sing because I had to do a corporate outing the next morning , very early . So I could n't go to the game , have a few beers , relax and enjoy it . It would have been fun to sing during the seventh-inning stretch with a couple of beers in me . I would have been more relaxed that way . But I was kind of uptight , having to get up the next morning . Are there any American customs you just do n't get ? Too many traffic lights , I think . I do n't like driving in traffic . The size of the food portions . There 's too much food , too much waste . But these are miniscule things . I think America has a lot to offer , and that 's why I live here . If I really did n't like living here I 'd be back in Europe right now . You got dragged into the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Casey . What do you make of what 's happened since that firestorm ? He 's seemed to struggle a lot since . It could very well be related . I think it 's very unfortunate . Obviously , he said a few things I 'm sure he wishes he could take back . But some of the things that were printed he definitely did n't say . They got blown out of proportion over here . It 's a shame it went as far as it did . Did you learn anything from the experience ? I do n't think you should ever comment on something if you do n't really know the full scale of what you 're talking about . The Gospel According to Luke HOW TO MAKE MORE PRESSURE PUTTS According to the PGA Tour 's ShotLink , Luke Donald converted 582 of 605 putts ( 96.2 percent ) inside of 6 feet . Use his secrets to sharpen your game Any putt inside 6 feet is a pressure putt because you expect to make it . And when you miss one , the effect can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They think only about making the next one . Here are my keys to sink more of the short putts that keep your round on track and keep you in the money . - Stay still . As a thought , imagine your head is resting up against a wall as you make your stroke , and that your arms are moving the putter back and forth . The club will swing more down the line for square contact . - Putt blind . The more makeable the putt , the more anxious you are to see the result . This can lead to a quick , jerky stroke . When I 'm practicing , I sometimes turn the visor of my cap down so I ca n't see the hole . You could simply shut your left eye as well . You wo n't be anxious so you can focus on making a good stroke . Remove yourself from the outcome and think positive . - Charge ! Take a more aggressive approach .
