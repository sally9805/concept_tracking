Chapter One If you thought you knew her , you did n't . If you thought because you had seen her on TV and read her features in the Sentinel , and maybe even met her once or twice at a panel discussion or at a news conference , that this gave you some idea of who she was , you would be wrong . Sometimes even Linda did n't know . She would look at herself in the mirror , and I witnessed this many mornings , her restlessness kicking her out of bed and in search of a newspaper , the coffeemaker gurgling , the radio murmuring NPR and the smell of buttered toast filling the kitchen-I would see her stop and stare at her reflection in the large mirror in the hall outside her bedroom . It was as if she suddenly glimpsed inside of herself , and this held true especially in the mornings when her guard was down and the softness of sleep still lingered around her . She stopped . She stared . She was n't examining her face for blemishes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pouty lips . She was looking into her own dark , drowsy eyes , searching . I kept still , watching from the bed , angled from her view . I feigned sleep . Linda pulled her hair back . She leaned forward , her gaze deepening into itself . I did n't know what she saw , and never asked . Hers was a private act . Linda and I had been dating for two years , marking not only the longest relationship I 'd been in , but the most puzzling as well . The initial rush of infatuation and lust was over . The grinding details of daily life had set in . And something was happening to us . We were-as some seasoned partners might say quietly to a friend over drinks , the lights low and the mood somber-we were having a little trouble . Trouble ? Sorry to hear that . What kind of trouble ? With this , a pained look would cross my face , a look of shame and melancholy as I would weigh the consequences of revealing personal truths that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect of having a sympathetic listener would be too great a temptation . I would feel the gentle tug to which weary confessors surrender . I would yearn for compassion . You see , I would say tentatively , lowering my voice . You see , she might be leaving me . No lightning bolts . No sudden flashes of insight with this revelation . No , just the dull clang of painful truth . This is a story about Linda as much as it is about me , about the disturbing events we would witness together and separately , about what happened after she visited her mother and stepfather in Los Angeles . She had flown down for a few reasons , though the most compelling seemed to be that she wanted some distance from me . A few hundred miles of distance . Three hundred and forty-four miles , to be precise . She needed , as she explained , some time alone . But there were more reasons . Her younger brother Hector had disappeared again , though this time her mother was really worried . Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , and she had n't seen her parents in almost three years , despite being only an hour away by plane . So , Linda flew out of San Francisco , and away from me . She flew out of our discord , out of her job as a features writer with which she was growing more unhappy , out of her daily life . She flew away to think , to evaluate . I could understand that . I am a believer in taking stock . So , this story begins with her uncertainty about us , and with me vaguely disappointed and confused . This story begins with my pained realization that maybe I had done something wrong but did n't know what , and that the pleasures of discovering someone whom you liked , whom you connected with , whom you 've found engagement with , once worn away , was quickly replaced by the shocking understanding that these things-these relationships-were very , very difficult . This story begins with a phone call from Linda after I returned home from a long run around the neighborhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderately hazardous day at work , and my thoughts had kept circling back to Linda , to my job , to a strange sense of solitude that I was actually enjoying but then feeling guilty about . This story begins , as many do , with a sense of regret . I view my life as a struggle for engagement . No , not the engagement to marry , or the engagement of a battle , though the two might possibly be related ; rather , a more general sense of engaging with others and myself . We try to connect through work , through play , through love , and yet the forces around us constantly keep us off balance and isolated . We wrestle endlessly in a vacuum , in a suffocating void , reaching out . But first , this : I was finishing up a surveillance job for Larry , since his workload was heavy . Last year he had taken me on as a conditional partner at Baxter Investigations in order to expand into executive protection and security , something for which he was n't licensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client protection only if it was directly relevant to a PI case , but because I was licensed as a private patrol operator , I was certified by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services to protect people and property . I was a bodyguard , a term most security professionals abhorred , but I did n't mind so much . No need for pretensions in this business . Larry knew where the money was . The hourly rate for executive protection started at twice that of a PI . The long-range goal sounded good . I would steal clients from my old firm , ProServ , and drum up new clients . Larry would get licensed as a private patrol operator , and we would move into full-scale executive protection . Baxter Investigations would become Baxter &; Choice Security . Larry had even mocked-up a business card , " B &C; Security , " that had a smart sword-and-shield logo in the background . Although this sounded good , the reality was different . I was having trouble bringing over old clients because ProServ and its main competition , Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silicon Valley economy was crashing , and companies were going bankrupt . Everyone was reining in expenses , especially in areas considered nonessential , like executive protection . Also , even with the small amount of publicity I had received two years ago , new clients were wary of small boutiques . Large companies , the best clients , wanted to deal with other large companies . The only steady work I 'd brought in was a jewelry appraiser and dealer requiring an escort every three weeks as he transported uncut gems to and from jewelers around the Bay Area . This guy had chosen me , it seemed , because he was Korean and liked the fact that I am Korean American . That was okay . I took what work I could find . Yet for some reason Larry 's end of the business was revving up . He had been getting more insurance companies and law firms asking for research , employee screenings , workers ' comp investigations , and general background checks . Executive protection might have been extraneous , but cheating employees were always a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , but the insurance companies were n't blinking . So now he needed help . The only problem was that I was n't licensed as a private investigator and could n't conduct interviews or deal with cases in any direct way . I could tail people , though . I could use a video camera . And that was what I did this afternoon . The subject , B.B. Smith , was a possible workers ' comp fraud case . The insurance company was paying while this guy rehabilitated from a construction-related back injury . They suspected fraud and hired Larry to check him out . Larry had already done all the background searches , the criminal and civil digging , the financial dirt , but had found little to help the case . He had been hoping to point to large debts , maybe a bankruptcy in the past , hints of financial trouble , but the guy was clean , and the next step was to wait and watch . The papers filed by Smith 's lawyer detailed Smith 's extreme pain and discomfort , the " incapacitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to catch Smith doing something that pointed to fraud . It was simple and straightforward , and I did n't mind this kind of legwork . I kept the tiny digital video camcorder attached to my hand , poised for recording , and stared out across the street . Smith , a huge bald man with tattoos along his arms and rolls of fat hanging over his belt , climbed slowly out of his truck and lumbered into his house . He had driven around Daly City-running errands at the post office and supermarket , eating lunch at a diner , browsing for hours at a Home Depot-and finally returned home for the day . I had n't recorded anything interesting , and turned on the camera 's night-vision option . The view screen flared brightly , then darkened to a low glitter , the camera searching and amplifying the barest embers of light . I stared through the viewfinder . Night vision was sexy . An aura of green and sparkling white settled around everything . Life shimmered with night vision . I had told Larry that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting bored . I tapped my fingers and looked around my car . A box of chocolate truffles I had impulsively bought lay on the passenger seat , a present for Linda when she returned . She liked the walnut-centered kind . When I had driven her to the airport , she had asked me to collect her mail and water her plants , though she did n't think she 'd be longer than a week . I volunteered to fly down there for a weekend ; I had never met her parents . She was quiet . The residue of our last argument-about spending more time by ourselves-laced our words . I amended my suggestion quickly by saying that I might have more work to do for Larry this weekend . " So you 're going to move into the PI end ? " she asked . " It might be the best way . Larry and I still have to talk about it . Maybe we 'll be licensed in both security and PI work to be more flexible . " She did n't seem to be listening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long curly dark hair pulled back and exposing her neck . Her profile , angular and sculpted , saddened me . Her nose , with the small bump on the bridge , twitched . She then asked to be let off at the terminal-no need to find parking . I gave her a quick kiss good-bye , and said , " I guess this trip is good . " " What ? " " For us . " She turned to me . Her eyes , normally wide and bright , seemed muted . She smiled sadly . " We just need time to think . That 's all . " I nodded , and she left the car and walked swiftly into the terminal without looking back . We needed time to think ? She needed time to think . Perhaps a bit of both . Our last argument had been a familiar one : I had bought her a new VCR because hers was eating tapes again . But I had surprised her with this , and I had assumed she would be pleased . She was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions as to why I had done this , put me on the defensive . I pointed to the ruined rentals , and the chewed news shows she tried to record . She said she preferred to buy her own things . As the argument grew more heated , it became clear to me that she objected not to the VCR but to my encroaching on her apartment . These were her things , and I had no right replacing them . Yes , she had a point , but I spent time there . I watched her TV with her . I thought she would appreciate the gift . The realization had hit me slowly . Wait a minute , I thought . It 's not the VCR . It 's me . I fumed . Why was I being made to feel foolish ? It was a stupid machine . Linda said , When I want a new one , I 'll buy one . This is my place . This is my VCR . Let me handle it . I said , It wo n't happen again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . That night I secretly browsed the relationship section of a bookstore . I needed guidelines . I needed checklists . Instead I found meaningless platitudes . I found advice about loving myself first . I thought , Give me something I can use . I had left the VCR in my apartment , not wanting to deal with it . Now I had missed the fourteen-day return window . So it was mine to keep . What the hell was I going to do with a VCR ? I did n't even have a TV . As it grew darker on Smith 's street , I checked the low light option on the camera and considered ending the surveillance . I 'd probably have to continue this tomorrow morning . I had plenty of other things to do as well . I had to start cold-calling old ProServ clients again , selling myself more aggressively . I was also looking into the PI licensing exam . Maybe I 'd read up on it tonight . The sound of a screen door banging shut stopped my thoughts . Smith trudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house , heading past his truck and toward his garage . I quickly raised the camera and rolled down my window , but I did n't have a good line of sight . Slipping out of the car while adjusting the settings on the camera , I moved quietly toward the garage . The air filled with static and jumping voices of jumbled radio stations , and then heavy-metal rock surfaced , wailing guitars distorting the speakers . The volume lowered . I moved along the side of the driveway , the shrubbery scratching my back , and paused at the sound of clanging . Larry had n't prepped the location , so I had no idea what was going on . I started recording . I heard Smith grunting as he pushed something heavy . Perfect . More clanging . I watched the viewfinder flare as I inched toward the garage , where there was more light . I stopped and stared into the glowing screen . Life should always be viewed with night vision , I thought . It filtered out the unimportant details . Backgrounds faded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A commercial came onto the radio . Smith let out a long , deep breath . Inching closer I saw Smith lying on a workout bench , his thick arms lifting up the bar with large iron plates on each side . Large weights lay on the floor around him . He slammed the bar back into position and sighed . I continued recording , zooming in , needing a shot of Smith 's face for identification . I smelled talcum powder and motor oil . Smith sat up slowly , wiping his forehead with his sweat suit sleeve , and I got a clear shot of his blotchy , shiny face . I wanted to leave but was n't sure how much the bench presses affected Smith 's back . He leaned forward and with each hand picked up a dumbbell . He began curls , flexing his biceps . He exhaled though his teeth , sweat beading on his bald head . I thought , Bingo . There was no way that someone with a had back could do those thirty-pound curls . " Yo , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I whirled around and saw a muscular man in shorts and T-shirt approaching , his thighs bulging with each step forward . He noticed my camera and said , " What the hell ? " Smith stood up off the bench and lowered the radio volume . Continues ...
