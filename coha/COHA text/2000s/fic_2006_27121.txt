Citizen Vince A Novel Chapter One One day you know more dead people than live ones . The thought greets Vince Camden as he sits up in bed , frantic , casting around a dark bedroom for proof of his existence and finding only props : nightstand , dresser , ashtray , clock . Vince breathes heavily . Sweats in the cool air . Rubs his eyes to shake the dust of these musings , not a dream exactly , this late-sleep panic  --  fine glass thin as paper , shattered and swirling , cutting as it blows away . Vince Camden pops his jaw , leans over , and turns off the alarm just as the one , five , and nine begin their fall . Each morning at 1:59 he sits up like this and turns off the clock radio in the split second before two and the shrill blast of alarm . He wonders : How is a thing like that possible ? And yet ... if you can manage such a trick  --  every morning waking up a few ticks before your alarm goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people you know ? Start with Grandparents . Two sets . One grandfather had a second wife . That 's five . Vince runs a toothbrush over his molars . Mother and father . Seven . Does a stillborn sister count ? No . A person has to have been alive to be dead . By the time he finishes his shower , blow-dries his hair , and gets dressed  --  gray slacks , longsleeve black dress shirt , two buttons open  --  he 's gone through family , neighbors , and former associates : already thirty-four people he knows to be dead . Wonders if that 's high , if it 's normal to know so many dead people . Normal . That word tails him from a safe distance most days . He opens a drawer and pulls out a stack of forged credit cards , looks at the names on the cards : Thomas A. Spaulding . Lane Bailey . Margaret Gold . He imagines Margaret Gold 's lovely normal life , a crocheted afghan tossed over the back of her sofa . How many dead people could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards  --  including Margaret Gold 's  --  and puts these in the pocket of his windbreaker . Fills the other pocket with Ziploc bags of marijuana . It 's 2:16 in the morning when Vince slides his watch onto his wrist , careful not to catch the thick hair on his forearm . Oh yeah , Davie Lincoln  --  retarded kid used to carry money in his mouth while he ran errands for Coletti in the neighborhood . Choked on a half-dollar . Thirty-five . Vince stands in the tiny foyer of his tiny house , if you can call a coatrack and a mail slot a foyer . Zips his windbreaker and snaps his cuffs out like a Vegas dealer leaving the table . Steps out into the world . About Vince Camden : he is thirty-six and white . Single . Six feet tall , 160 pounds , broad-shouldered and thin , like a martini glass . Brown and blue , as the police reports have recorded his hair and eyes . His mouth curls at the right corner , thick eyebrows go their own way , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who has ever been involved with him eventually arrives at the same expression , hands on hips , head cocked : Please . Be serious . Vince is employed in midlevel management , food industry : baking division  --  donuts . Generally , there is less to making donuts than one might assume . But Vince likes it , likes getting to work at 4:30 in the morning and finishing before lunch . He feels as if he 's gotten one over on the world , leaving his place of employment for lunch and simply not coming back . He 's realizing this is a fixed part of his personality , this desire to get one over on the world . Maybe there is a hooky gene . Outside , he pulls the collar of his windbreaker against his cheeks . Cold this morning : late October . Freezing , in fact  --  the steam leaks from his mouth and reminds him of an elementary school experiment with dry ice , which reminds him of Mr. Harlow , his fifth-grade teacher . Hanged himself after it became common knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thirty-six . It 's a serene world from your front steps at 2:20 in the morning : dim porch lights on houses black with sleep ; sidewalks split the dark dewed lawns . But the night has a grimmer hold on Vince 's imagination , and he shivers with the creeping sensation  --  even as he reminds himself it 's impossible  --  that he 's on the menu tonight . " So what ... YOU want me to do this thing or not ? " The two men stare across the bench seat of a burgundy Cadillac Seville . The driver asks : " How much would something like that cost ? " The bigger man , in the passenger seat , is impatient , restless , but he pauses to think . It 's a fair question . After all , it is 1980 , and the service industries are mired in this stagnant economy , too . Are the criminal sectors subject to the same sad market forces : inflation , deflation , stagflation ? Recession ? Do thugs suffer double-digit unemployment ? Do criminals feel malaise ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " repeats the driver , shifting in the leather seat . " Yeah . " And after a pause : " Means free . " " I know what it means . I was just surprised . That 's all . You 're saying you 'll help me out with this guy for free ? " " I 'm saying we 'll work something out . " " But it wo n't cost me anything ? " " We 'll work it out . " And it says something about the man driving the Cadillac that in addition to not knowing what the word gratis means , he also does n't realize that nothing is free .
