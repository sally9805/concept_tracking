POEMS ( 1961 ) * * * THIS MORNING HERE This is this morning : all the evils and glories of last night are gone except for their effects : the great world wars I and II , the great marriage of Edward the VII or VIII to Wallis Warfield Simpson and the rockets numbered like the Popes have incandesced in flight or broken on the moon : now the new day with its famous beauties to be seized at once has started and the clerks have swept the sidewalks to the curb , the glass doors are open , and the first customers walk up and down the supermarket alleys of their eyes to Muzak . Every item has been cut out of its nature , wrapped disguised as something else , and sold clean by fractions . Who can multiply and conquer by the Roman numbers ? Lacking the Arab frenzy of the zero , they have obsolesced : the butchers have washed up and left after having killed and dressed the bodies of the lambs all night , and those who never have seen blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrepeatable mistake because this circus of their present is all gravy . ON AN EAST WIND FROM THE WARS The wind came in for severalthousand miles all night and changed the close lie of your hair this morning . It has brought well-travelled sea-birds who forget their passage , singing . Old songs from the old battle- and burial-grounds seem new in new lands . They have to do with spring as new in seeming as the old air idling in your hair in fact . So new , so ignorant of any weather not your own , you like it , breathing in a wind that swept the battlefields of their worst smells , and took the dead unburied to the potter 's field of air . For miles they sweetened on the sea-spray , the foul washed off , and what is left is spring to you , love , sweet , the salt blown past your shoulder luckily . No wonder your laugh rings like a chisel as it cuts your children 's new names in the tombstone of thin air . ON AN OLD ADVERTISEMENT AND AFTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Arabian , will stand for stud at fifty bucks a throw , but there is naturally a richer commerce in his act , eased in this instance by a human palm and greased with money : the quiver in his haunch is not from flies , no ; the hollow-sounding , kitten-crushing hooves are sharp and blind , the hind ones hunting purchase while the fore rake at the mare 's flank of the sky . Also , the two- or three-foot prick that curls the mare 's lip back in solar ectasy is greater than the sum of its desiring : the great helm of the glans , the head of feeling in the dark , is what spits out , beyond itself , its rankly generative cream . After that heat , the scraggled , stallion-legged foal is not as foolish as his acts : the bucking and the splayed-out forelegs while at grass are practices : he runs along her flank in felt emergencies , inspired by love to be his own sweet profit of the fee and the desire , compounded at more interest than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Indoor Plant : A Dull Life The person of this plant with heart-shaped leaves and off-shot stalks , bending at each knee , is built of dishwater , cigarette smoke , no sunlight , and humus mixed with peat-moss . Like genius , it survives our inattention and the dark , potted like myself indoors , and goes on growing . It grows for no known cause that I can find outside itself , by means of mumbling , flowering no flowers , no flowers , none for all these years . Since imagination has the answer to these noes , imagine it as one of those survivors in the old swamps , shadowed by the grown , light-headed conifers : fit for the damps , whose gentlest odor seems corrosive , mightily akin to older , shadowed ferns , it might have dropped its pollen in the black water where the pollen swam , and thus become perseverant in going on in lust , like us , and mobile through its young . Even now it does move on in time , too , each elbow putting out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . Who knows what in hell it loves or lacks as crawler in arrest . Sometimes to water it , to notice it , to keep it out of the bureau drawer and trained to climb perennially around itself , is piety enough toward indoor plants right now when one is thirsty , too , for rich lost tastes and light streaming down through amniotic air . GLOSS Balance and survival : it has a strategy of elbows as it breaks its hairy knees while climbing up the wall and then juts off again , shaped like a claw . Even at its top most broken elbow , it must turn uprooted from its heaven in the air , and , in going down , not find it on the floor , either . Compelled to move anyhow , it always has an angle and an out in going nowhere , all around itself in faith and doubt .
