Chapter One Shoulda ditched the bitch back in Marietta . Ace Goodall was tempted to open his fist and let her tumble down the ravine . She was dead weight , dragging him down , same as any woman . That 's all they were good for , except on those cold nights when they opened their legs and gave up their heat the way God intended . It was September , and the nights had definitely taken a turn toward chilly in the Southern Appalachian Mountains . So she might be worth keeping for a little while , despite being a bitch . He pulled , wrapping his other arm around a maple sapling for balance . She barely weighed a hundred pounds , though she was nearly as tall as he was . Five feet five inches , not much rump to speak of , knockers the size of peaches but not nearly as fuzzy . Her hair was black and stringy , but considering she had n't bathed since the last rain a week ago , she looked pretty good . Plus she was rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much use out here in the wilderness . He squeezed her wrist a little harder than needed as she scrambled for purchase on the leaf-covered loam . Clara Bannister . An uppity fucking name if there ever was one . " You think they saw us ? " she whispered . " No , but they sure as hell are going to hear us if you do n't shut that trap . " She could n't . Figured . Anyway , the river throbbed in the background with a white wash of sound , so they were n't likely to be heard . " Was it some of them ? " " Do n't rightly know . It 's not like they wore dark suits and sunglasses like the spooks on TV . " " Who else would be way out here on a weekday ? " Ace wondered that himself . They 'd encountered a few serious hikers , and those were pretty easy to spot with their worn leather boots , sweaty bandannas , and oily hair . Most had fancy backpacks with aluminum framework , far superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd been tempted to pull out his Colt Python and ask politely if one of the Greenpeace freaks cared to trade , but then he 'd probably end up shooting somebody . Word would get around , and the peaceful back-to-nature bit would go all to hell . Hikers were no trouble , because even if they knew about Ace Goodall 's track record , they would never expect to meet him face-to-face , especially thirty miles from the closest convenience store . Normal people had a hard time believing Ace 's kind existed , and probably slept better that way . They did n't understand that Ace was toiling on their behalf , doing the Lord 's dirty work himself because they lacked the balls and faith and outrage . No , hikers would n't give him a second glance . These last two had been different . Sure , they packed all the right brand-name gear , sported a touch of stubble , and bore that gritty-eyed look of men who had recently slept under the stars . But something was n't right . Maybe their steel-toed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too precise , like soldiers on a field exercise . They did n't droop . They stood upright , alert , as if paying close attention to their surroundings . More like hunters than hikers . If Ace and Clara had n't been resting on a slight rise , under the shade of a lightning-charred oak , they probably would have bumped into the pair on the trail . Ace trusted his instincts , what he called his " little messages from above , " and his gut reaction had been that these guys were trouble . Not trouble like Ace , who could cut you open and count your ribs from the inside before your heart stopped beating , but trouble of the long-armed-law variety . " Something ai n't right about them , " he said , wiping sweat from the back of his neck . Though the nights had hinted at frost , it was still Indian summer during the day . The woods were rich with the smell of goldenrod , daisies , and ironweed , as well as the ripe odor of rotting leaves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him a smile , and those neat white teeth irritated him , a reminder of his own upbringing . His family could n't afford dental care . Though Ace had just crossed that hallowed ground into his thirties , he 'd already lost three adult teeth , only one of them from a fistfight . Some of the others were black , and a cavity in his bottom left molar had hit the roots and tongued him with hellfire . " I told you , The Lord 's looking after us . It 's holy work . " " I believe you . " " Sometimes I feel like I could drive right up to the biggest police station in the South , park right out front in a handicapped spot , wave my pecker around , and they 'd never even give me a ticket . " Ace forgot to keep his voice down . A prison chaplain had once explained to him about " religious mania , " but though Ace had a fondness for crazy people , he did n't cotton much to maniacs . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What do we do now ? " Clara asked . " If we go back to the trail , we might run into them . " " We got an hour or so before sundown . " Ace squinted through the sparse foliage of the treetops to the smeared patch of purple sunset in the west . " Let 's just stick to the ridge and then set up camp when we find a flat spot . " He turned and walked between the towering hardwoods , knowing she would follow without question . The river pulsed with a constant dull roar below them , a white noise that washed over the sounds of birds and small animals . The force of the river made the ridge vibrate . Ace could dig that raw power . Like the bombs in his knapsack . Ace was n't much of a nature freak , but he 'd learned the best way to evade attention was to go where no one else bothered . If that meant hiding out for a while in the ass end of Possum Paradise , then so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days , though the trail sometimes meandered away from the river 's course because of the steepness of the grade . Ace had seen the foaming brown-green water and , even from a safe distance , he could visualize it churning around rocks and making its mad dash for the Atlantic Ocean . He bent , kicked up a fist-sized stone , and hurled it into the gorge . If he had bigger balls , he 'd stand on the rocky ledge and take a piss . Nothing like heights to make a man want to arc a yellow rainbow . But he figured water made its way downhill no matter what , and eventually it all ended up in the same place . They came to a group of jagged gray stones protruding from the black dirt like the fingers of a premature burial victim . A fine , chilly spray added weight to the air . The trees thinned and Ace could make out the walls of the gorge . Off-white rock plunged eighty feet down , worn smooth by aeons of running water that had probably started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the skin of the Earth . The rock bore the stubble of twisted , stunted balsams , and veins of quartz crystal glittered in the dying daylight . Though they were fifty feet from the ledge , Ace got vertigo from the yawning space of the gorge . A section of the ledge had recently given way , judging by the dirt clinging to the upturned roots . The rocks were different , too , not worn and splotched with gray moss like those across the rest of the ridge . Clara had told him the Appalachian chain was the oldest stretch of mountains in the world , which Ace thought was dumb , because the Book of Genesis set down the creation date of the heavens and Earth as all at once . So how could one mountain be older than another ? At any rate , Ace did n't like the thought of standing anywhere near that ledge . The walls of the gorge looked like so many stacked pieces of rock , anyway , and if a piece kicked out somewhere near the bottom , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledge , heading into the woods . It would be time to camp soon . Clara stood a moment longer , looking out over the ripples of soil and trees that spread as far as the eye could see before vanishing into a soft , blue haze on the horizon . Ace waited for her footsteps in the leaves behind him . " Haircuts , " he shouted , loudly enough to be heard over the river . " Huh ? " Clara 's pretty pink mouth was hanging open . If he were a violent man , he 'd backhand her for looking like an idiotic mouth-breather . " Haircuts . That 's what was wrong with them . Trimmed above the ears , the kind that do n't need no comb . " She nodded , finally closing her mouth . Ace unclenched his fists and rubbed a palm over his own greasy , tangled scalp . " Think of the people we 've seen out here , " he said . " None of them looked like they been in spitting distance of a bar of soap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleas . " Clara scratched her underarm , as if remembering some of their sleazy lodgings of the few weeks . " Those guys looked clean , like something out of the Ivy League , " she said . Ace did n't know fuck about the Ivy League . Sounded like soccer , or some other foreign sport . " Or maybe Quantico , " he said . " Good thing they did n't see us , then . " Ace smiled , curling his tongue in the gap of a missing canine . " Told ya , it 's God 's doing , " he said . Just like God had helped him rig the time-delay fuses on those bombs in Birmingham and Tupelo . A little fire and brimstone for the baby-butchers . He waved toward a small clearing away from the ledge . " Come on , let 's make camp before dark . " Chapter Two The thrill is gone . B.B. King sang it as a bluesy lament about lost love . Bowie Whitlock applied the sentiment equally to his dead wife , his profession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . The breaths were coming a bit short now , and he wondered if his legendary endurance had faded a little with time , rust , and indifference . A mile deep in the Unegama Wilderness Area and he already felt used up , a wet nurse with a dry tit who had a half-dozen snapping , hungry mouths to feed . The real journey still lay ahead , all thirteen miles of it , not counting the half-day hike to the launch point . Wednesday had broken at forty degrees and died at seventy , Indian summer in the mountains . All of them would be sweating by the time they reached their campsite at the headwaters . The thrill is gone and still you walk . Alone . Bowie was in the lead , and the group had fallen into a single-file march , though the trail was several feet wide . This part of the trail was clearly marked , with little change in elevation , and there was no practical need for Bowie to take point . He 'd done it as a psychological tactic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if the trip went smoothly , a time would inevitably come for quick decisions . Probably not of the life-and-death variety , despite Farrengalli 's blowhard attitude and big chin , but the remote heart of the wilderness was no place to debate the pecking order . Farrengalli had fallen to the rear of the group , probably fantasizing about all the Vietnam War movies he 'd watched . ProVentures ' patsies , Bowie had taken to calling the members of the group . Like him , they each had a reason for being there , mostly having to do with a mixture of moxie , money , and a little bit of madness . Vincent Farrengalli , a loudmouthed Italian from the Bronx , had immediately set Bowie 's pulse two degrees above where it needed to be . Farrengalli was trouble , mostly because he was the least qualified to be on the trip . ProVentures and Back2-Nature Magazine wanted him for his dark looks and brashness , which amounted to handsome publicity whether the trip was a success or failure . Bowie gave an extra tug on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leather during the summer , a tribute to the two hundred daily sit-ups and his vegetarian diet . Obsessive routine served him well . One more rep , one more step . Prevented him from thinking , dwelling , remembering . Memory was a thing to be obliterated at any cost , be it through pain , pride , or the simple joy of loathing the jackasses who had hired him . At least those jackasses paid well . If Bowie survived this gig , he 'd be set for a few more years of solitude . Attitude was everything , and a little mystique helped with the hype . Bowie had a reputation , all right , though he only cared when the bean counters made a big deal of it . He knew he was on the downhill slide and soon reputation would be all he had left . But that was just as well . The thrill , after all , was gone for good . Nothing left but the next step , the next rep . The next breath . For perennial Tour de France champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Bowie , it was all about the boots . He 'd logged two thousand miles in the personally designed Timberlands that hugged his feet like twin sets of spooning lovers . In the group orientation meeting , Bowie had advised everyone to buy either a waterproof boot or else apply waterproofing themselves . He 'd even recommended SealSkinz socks , though he was n't getting any sponsorship kickbacks from the company . But he did n't think anyone had followed his advice . They 'd probably survive , but he would n't mind if they were visited with blisters , bunions , athlete 's foot fungus , and the odd hangnail thrown in for good measure . " Yo , how much farther ? " said someone a couple of places back . Bowie had to slow his breathing and divert his cynical musings to come up with the name . Initials . Something with initials . Rhymes with " hay . " Okay . A-okay . Okay McKay . C.A. McKay , the golden boy , the next Lance Armstrong . Finished sixth at the Giro del Capo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong 's retirement , was expected to soon move to the head of the United States bicycling class . Bowie suspected that if the sponsors had decided on a mountain bike expedition instead of a white-water trip , McKay would be point and Bowie would be watching the sun and moon track the big sky above his cabin near the Missouri Breaks in Montana . Bowie almost wished he were in that remote and personal world , lost in thought , except he knew thoughts would lead to that dark hole , a place his mind sought as persistently as a tongue probed a lost tooth . Biker boy . C.A. " Okay " McKay . The type of catchy name you need . Nabbed the latest cover of Cycling News , gets laid more than George Clooney , but on this trip , he 's middle of the pack . I 'm first . " A mile and a half , " Bowie said . The distance to the Unegama headwaters where they would make camp was more like a mile and two thousand feet , but he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't want to waste breath explaining . Truth be told ( not that he 'd ever admit the truth-no use changing old habits now ) , his lungs were working a bit harder than expected . " Mile and a half , " McKay passed along , so much louder than necessary in the hush of the forest that Bowie suspected he , too , was sucking for oxygen . " With wheels , I could do that in ten minutes . " " Well , next time get your bike company to put up the money , and we 'll do it the easy way , " Bowie said . " This time we 're doing it the ProVentures way . " " The best way , " said the man behind Bowie and in front of McKay . Bowie had forgotten the man 's name . All Bowie knew was his checks were signed by the outdoor adventure company , which had been started by two stoners with a love for the great outdoors , but now mostly employed computer geeks and business majors . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a " most excellent " logo , one designed to appeal to daybreak rollers , High Noon huffers , teatime puffers , and midnight tokers . The logo featured an infamous five-fingered plant in bold green beneath a jagged red slash . " Just Say Maybe , " read that original logo . Over the years , as the rebel teen customers became soft in the belly and no longer lit up before board meetings , the ProVentures logo had transformed first to a five-branched green tree , then an upended peace sign ; then the red slash went away , and for the last five years the company was widely recognized for its slanted P logo with a lesser-green image of the globe behind it . " The best way , " Bowie parroted without looking back . Point never looked back , unless there was an emergency . " The ProVentures way , " the company man said , almost as if a cheer were expected . " Pro-fuckin ' - Ventures , " Farrengalli shouted from the rear . " You guys fucking rock . " Fuckin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " Fuckin ' A " any second now , because he watched Apocalypse Now ten times . " It 's only natural , " the company man said , spouting the slogan the company had adopted after the stock split four ways . " O-o-o-o-o-nly FUCKIN ' NATURALLLLL ! ! ! ! ! " Farrengalli bellowed in a voice that drowned out the first few whistling birds and scuffling ground animals Bowie had heard since the start of the hike . He wanted to tell the greaseball to eat a dirty root . Because the quiet had been nice . Almost too nice . (
