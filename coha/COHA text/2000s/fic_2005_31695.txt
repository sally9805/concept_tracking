Sky Ship Today , Soz 's world would change forever . Born Sauscony Lahaylia Valdoria Skolia , she just went by Soz to most everyone . She had spent her first seventeen years of life in an idyllic existence , but she was determined to leave it behind . Today she would leap for the sky -- with or without permission . Soz stood outside , on a walkway that topped the massive wall surrounding her home . The house was a small castle of pale bluestone , with turreted towers at its four corners . The muted calls of children and the whistling of lyrine in their stable came from below , in the courtyards . Beyond the house , the village of Dalvador rose like an island in the plains , beneath the lavender sky of the world Lyshriol . She loved this land and she loved her family . Her father , the Dalvador Bard , recorded the history of his people in ballads . The days passed in pastoral beauty , warmed in the golden haze of two amber suns . But she could n't stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyshriol out of its orbit , so Soz would soon leave her tranquil life here . By interstellar standards , the house was primitive -- but only on the exterior . Over the years , Soz 's mother had arranged subtle modifications to this ancestral home of her husband . The optical , electrical , and superconducting systems were hidden ; mesh networks were accessible only by discreet consoles ; mechbots cleaned when no one was around ; and the self-repair nanobots in the building 's structure were too small to see . The improvements never marred the beauty of Lyshriol . The Dalvador Plains extended in all directions around the village . Far to the northwest , they lappedagainst the Stained Glass Forest , a jeweled swirl in the foothills of the Backbone Mountains . Beyond the forest , the Backbone raised its spindled peaks into the sky ; beyond that , the massive range called Ryder 's Lost Memory rose up , so distant it was no more than a violet haze . To the east , a cluster of rustic buildings stood at the edge of a broad , flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a tiny village . But it was far , far more . A ship was landing on the tarmac of the minuscule starport , its roar obliterating the sounds of children and lyrine in the courtyard below . Beautiful and deadly , glowing like alabaster against the sky , a Jag starfighter set down on the field . Soz had n't expected this unscheduled visitor , but she intended to seize the opportunity . She would convince the pilot to take her off planet -- away from this smothering paradise . Shannon Valdoria ran through the plains . He raced through the swaying , supple reeds , his passage teasing the iridescent bubbles off the tips of stalks . The filmy spheres floated into the air and popped , spraying him with glitter . He ignored them , running hard . The whitewashed houses of Dalvador interrupted the plains , their blue or purple roofs like blossoms turned upside down on the houses . Shannon had never seen a flower , except in holobooks his tutors gave him about other worlds . Today he had escaped his studies and wandered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reeds , drowsing beneath the suns . The roar of the ship had awoken him . Now he ran toward the starport , and his white-gold hair whipped across his face . Just into adolescence , he had yet to reach his full growth , but it was already clear he would never achieve the towering size of his older brothers . No matter . None could match his speed ; he ran like the wind that rippled the reeds around him . Exhaust billowed into the sky as the starfighter landed . Eldrinson Valdoria sat in his dove-tail chair , the one his wife called a work of art , molded as it was from purple glasswood and set with white and rose brocaded cushions . He was composing a ballad to record events of the past year , the weddings , births , and deaths in Dalvador . He held his drummel , or drum-harp , on his lap and plucked its strings , evoking a cascade of notes that sparkled like clear water in a creek . Today he sang in his tenor range , and his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recorded the history of his people in ballads . He had left off the lights , avoiding the technological marvels his wife had brought into his life . Even after being married to her for three octets of years , he still was n't used to it all . He could have lit an oil lamp , but he enjoyed the shadows that pooled here . The stone floor remained cool . All was quiet , though a few minutes ago a great wind had roared outside , unusually loud . Across the room , the four-poster bed stood solidly , its posts carved in totems of bubbles . The downy quilt was puffed like a blue and rose cloud . He contentedly strummed the harp while he thought of the children he and Roca had made in that bed , an octet plus two more . Eldrin , their oldest , was gone from home seven years now , a father himself with a young son . A knock came on the door . Eldrinson smiled , thinking of his wife . " Roca ? " A man answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensed as Del 's unease came to him . In a family of empaths , they tended to keep their moods private behind mental shields , but Del 's concern was strong enough to reach him despite those protections . He set down the drummel and went to the blue glasswood door . Opening it revealed a man of twenty-four , or twenty in the decimal system of counting that Roca used . Del had features that Roca called " edgily handsome , " though Eldrinson did n't really know what she meant . Del looked like him , and no one called him edgy . They both had violet eyes and shoulder-length hair the color of burgundy wine . He supposed it was true Del did have a fiercer aspect about him . Long and leanly muscled , he stood taller than most men of Lyshriol , his height inherited from his mother . The title of Bard would go to Eldrinson 's oldest son if he ever returned to Lyshriol , but if not , Eldrinson thought he would choose Del to follow him . Del 's songs tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softer ballads his father composed . Eldrinson had never understood Del 's angry , tangled music , but it fascinated him . " What 's wrong ? " Eldrinson asked . " A Jag has come . " Del must have been singing too long again ; his deep voice sounded hoarse . " Jag ? " Eldrinson asked . " What does that mean ? " " A starship , " Del said , shifting his weight , taut with contained energy . " Oh . Yes . " Eldrinson stepped out into the antechamber . " A military ship , is n't it ? " His son Althor had spoken about them . " I think so . " Walking with him , Del reached across to his hip for the sword he was n't wearing . He stiffened when his hand closed on air . Then he just stalked at his father 's side . It relieved Eldrinson that the ship did n't thrill his son . Del had never shown any inclination to leave Lyshriol . In that , he took after his father ; on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been acutely uncomfortable . Why would a warship from her people come here now ? She had mentioned no visitors . They headed down the hall outside his suite . Del had a longer stride , but he held back for his father . The tension felt almost tangible in this restless , moody son of his . " Where is your mother ? " Eldrinson asked as they descended the curving staircase to the lower levels . " I think she went to see Vyrl and Lily . " Now that Eldrinson thought about it , he did remember Roca saying she might visit the grandchildren . It would give Vyrl , their fourth son , a chance to study for his college placement exams . The boy had already delayed them a year , caught up in his young family and the new farm . Eldrinson did n't have a good feel for this business about Vyrl being a " virtual " student who would attend an offworld university through the mesh ; he was just glad the boy would n't leave Dalvador . The impetuous fellow had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . Although Vyrl and Lily had been a bit young , it had n't seemed that unusual to Eldrinson . Couples in Dalvador often married around the time they reached two octets in age . Vyrl and Lily had n't been that much younger . He had never understood Roca 's shock , as if they were two children instead of a young man and woman in love . It gratified him to see his son happy , grown into a man now , a husband and father . A door slammed below , followed by the pounding of running feet . Eldrinson and Del came around the curve of the stairs into view of the Hearth Room , which stretched out to a large fireplace . Eldrinson 's youngest son , Kelric , was just running into the room . " Father ! " Kelric jolted to a stop at the stairs , his face flushed . He looked so much like his mother , with her gold coloring and spectacular good looks , though on him it was boyish rather than angelic . He was only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall as his father and had more bulk . He stared up at them , his thick curls tousled over his collar , his eyes lit with excitement . " It 's a Jag ! " Kelric waved his hand in the direction of the port . " Can I go look ? Do you think they would give me a ride ? " Del stopped on the stairs and crossed his arms . " How do you know they have n't come here to blow you up ? " " It 's an Imperialate ship ! They 're supposed to protect us . " Kelric turned his eager gaze on his father . " Can I go ? " Eldrinson exhaled , calming his pulse . He wished he could share Kelric 's zeal . Yes , the Skolian Imperialate , his wife 's people , protected this world . But their military was an enigma to him , a great dark machine . Their ships usually stayed in orbit ; he could n't see how this one could be bringing anything but trouble . He started down the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " " Father . " Del drew him to a stop . " Maybe you should n't go out there . It might be better if we contact the port from here . This building has safeguards . " Eldrinson squinted at him . " I do n't know how to make them work . " Roca had arranged the security system , and every year strangers updated it , but he had never been clear on exactly how it protected the house . Del scratched his chin . " I think it has to be activated from the console room . " " Do you know how to do it ? " Eldrinson asked . " I could figure it out . " " It 's easy , " Kelric said impatiently . " I can do it . " Del scowled at him . " This is n't something for a little boy . You would probably end up inviting them to shoot at Dalvador . " " I would not ! And I 'm not little . " Kelric sped up the staircase , easily taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , he added , " We can watch from the Blue Tower . If they do anything bad , I 'll go turn on the security system . " Eldrinson glanced at Del . His older son shrugged , then lifted his hand , inviting him up the stairs . They returned the way they had come , following Kelric . The tower looked out over the massive wall that surrounded the house . The circular chamber at its top was made from pale bluestone , with a domed ceiling and a blue glasswood door . Eldrinson stood with his two sons at the arched window , watching the port . The Jag had settled onto the tarmac and fumes drafted around its alabaster body . Out in the plains , a slender figure was running toward the port , a cloud of drifting bubbles in his wake . Shannon . Eldrinson would have recognized his sixth son anywhere . With his pale hair and slight build , the boy resembled the half-legendary Blue Dale Archers from the northern mountains . Closer by , Soz stood on the walkway outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gazed out at the port . Atypically , she wore a dress today , one of the bright , swirling affairs most girls in Dalvador adopted . Usually she preferred breeches and shirts . He had never fathomed why such a beautiful girl wanted to dress like a boy , but arguing with her never achieved anything . This daughter of his was a force of nature that could n't be denied . Eldrinson did n't understand Soz . He loved her , but she was a mystery . Offworld technology fascinated her . As a child , she had taken apart her brother 's laser carbine and put it back together before Eldrinson even figured out what she was doing . He could n't keep up with her razor-sharp mind . Most of all , he dreaded the distant look that came into her eyes when she gazed at the night sky with its brilliant , cold stars . She was slipping away from him and he did n't know how to bring her back . Kelric pushed open the window and leaned out , crowding Del . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Careful . You could fall . " The boy flashed him an intense look , half apology , half frustration . Then he turned back to the starship . It tore at Eldrinson to see his rapt expression . How long before the wanderlust took Kelric away , too ? " Look ! " Kelric waved at the ship . " People are coming ! " Eldrinson peered where he pointed . Two people in dark clothes had left the Jag and were crossing the tarmac . A woman came out of a port building holding some object , probably a holofile , though he could n't be sure from so far away . She conferred with the visitors , handed one of them the file , waited while he did something with it , then took it back and returned to her house . " That looked routine , " Del said . " They do n't seem to be threatening anyone . " An odd feeling tugged at Eldrinson , an anticipation he did n't understand . Why ? Perhaps he was picking that up from Kelric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh-high reeds , except on them , the reeds barely came above their knees . One was an unusually tall man , but Eldrinson was n't sure about the other . A woman possibly , given the curves of her body , except she was as tall as the man . He had become used to such women among his wife 's people ; Roca was his own size , and he was above average for a man on Lyshriol . But this person would tower even over Roca . " Are those soldiers ? " Del asked . " They 're Jagernauts ! " Kelric said . " Real ones . " Eldrinson hesitated . " Skolian warriors , you mean ? " " Fighter pilots ! " The boy beamed at him . " Like Althor will be someday . " " Ah . " Eldrinson nodded . His second oldest son , Althor , had gone offworld three years ago to study at a military academy . Althor had never had trouble with Skolian disciplines . It gratified Eldrinson , because he could n't learn to read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up spoken languages without thinking , and Skolian base ten numbers came easily to him . He could even see why they counted in tens instead of eights . They had ten fingers instead of eight . Their hand structure was odd , with no hinge that let the palm fold lengthwise , so two fingers on each side could oppose each other . Instead , they had a fifth digit , a " thumb . " So their base ten made sense . But so much else about them did n't , their reading , science , literature . That some of his children learned it so easily never ceased to impress him . But why did he think of that now ? " By Rillia 's arrow , " he suddenly said . Del and Kelric turned to him with identical expressions , their foreheads creased in puzzlement . " Ca n't you feel it ? " Eldrinson asked . Surely they must . They , too , were empaths . Del tilted his head . " Something ... " " Yes ! " Kelric cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squinted at their visitors , who were halfway to Dalvador now . Then he answered his own question . " Oh , I see . " Eldrinson stood straighter , filling with joy and uncertainty . Althor had come home .
