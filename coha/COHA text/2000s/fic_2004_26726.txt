Mutant Message Down Under Honored Guest It seems there should have been some warning , but I felt none . Events were already in motion . The group of predators sat , miles away , awaiting their prey . The luggage I had unpacked one hour before would tomorrow be tagged " unclaimed " and stay in storage , month after month . I was to become merely one more American to disappear in a foreign country . It was a sweltering October morning . I stood looking down the drive of the Australian five-star hotel for an unknown courier . Contrary to receiving a warning , my heart was literally singing . I felt so good , so excited , so successful and prepared . Inwardly I sensed , " Today is my day . " A topless jeep pulled into the circular entrance . I remember hearing the tires hiss on the steaming pavement . A fine spray of water leaped over the bordering foliage of brilliant red bottlebrush to touch the rusty metal . The jeep stopped , and the driver , a thirty-year-old Aborigine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his black hand beckoned . He was looking for a blond American . I was expecting to be escorted to an Aboriginal tribal meeting . Under the censoring blue eyes and disapproving manner of the uniformed Aussie doorman , we mentally agreed to the match . Even before I made the awkward struggle of high heels into the all-terrain vehicle , it was obvious I was overdressed . The young driver to my right wore shorts , a dingy white T-shirt , and sockless tennis shoes . I had assumed when they arranged transportation for the meeting , it would be a normal automobile , perhaps a Holden , the pride of Australia 's car manufacturers . I never dreamed he would arrive in something wide open . Well , I would rather be overdressed than underdressed to attend a meeting -- my award banquet . I introduced myself . He merely nodded and acted as if he were already certain of who I was . The doorman frowned at us as we propelled past him . We drove through the streets of the coastal city , past rows of veranda-fronted homes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutched the door handle as we circled a roundabout where six directions merged . When we exited , our new heading put the sun at my back . Already the newly acquired , peach-colored business suit and matching silk blouse were becoming uncomfortably warm . I guessed the building was across town , but I was wrong . We entered the main highway running parallel to the sea . This meeting was apparently out of town , further from the hotel than I anticipated . I removed my jacket , thinking how foolish it was not to have asked more questions . At leastI had a brush in my purse , and my shoulder-length bleached hair was pinned up in a fashionable braid . My curiosity had not subsided from the moment I received the initial phone call , although when it came I could n't say I was truly surprised . After all , I had received other civic recognitions , and this project had been a major success . Working with urban-dwelling , half-caste Aboriginal adults who had openly displayed suicidal attitudes , and accomplishing for them a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed sooner or later . I was surprised ; the tribe issuing the summons lived two thousand miles away , on the opposite coast of the continent , but I knew very little about any of the Aboriginal nations except the idle comments I heard occasionally . I did n't know if they were a close-knit race or if , like Native Americans , vast differences , including different languages , were common . What I really wondered about was what I would receive : another wooden engraved plaque , to be sent back for storage in Kansas City , or perhaps simply a bouquet of flowers ? No , not flowers , not in one-hundred-degree weather . That would be too cumbersome to take on the return flight . The driver had arrived promptly , as agreed , at twelve o'clock noon . So I knew , of course , I was in for a luncheon meeting . I wondered what in the world a native council would serve for our meal ? I hoped it would not be a catered traditional Australian affair . Perhaps they would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time . I was hoping to see a table laden with colorful casseroles . This was going to be a wonderfully unique experience , and I was looking forward to a memorable day . The purse I carried , purchased for today , held a 35-mm camera and a small tape recorder . They had n't said anything about microphones or spotlights or my giving a speech , but I was prepared anyway . One of my greatest assets was thinking ahead . After all , I was now fifty years old , had suffered enough embarrassment and disappointments in my life to have adopted plans for alternative courses . My friends remarked how self-sufficient I was . " Always has Plan B up her sleeve , " I could hear them saying . A highway road train ( the Australian term for a truck pulling numerous full-sized trailers in convoy style ) passed us heading in the opposite direction . They came bolting out of fuzzy heat waves , straight down the center of the pavement . I was shaken back from my memories when the driver jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a rugged dirt road , followed for miles by a fog of red dust . Somewhere , the two well-worn ruts disappeared , and I became aware there was no longer a road in front of us . We were zigzagging around bushes and jumping over the serrated , sandy desert . I tried to make conversation several times , but the noise of the open vehicle , the brush from the underside of the chassis , and the movement of my body up and down , made it impossible . It was necessary to hold my jaws tightly together to keep from biting my tongue . Obviously the driver had no interest in opening the portals of speech . My head bounced as if my body were a child 's cloth doll . I was getting hotter and hotter . My pantyhose felt like they were melted on my feet , but I was afraid to remove a shoe for fear it would bounce out into the expanse of copper-colored flatness surrounding us as far as the eye could see . I had no faith the mute driver would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped them off with the hem of my slip . The movement of my arms let open the floodgate to a river of perspiration . I could feel my makeup dissolve and pictured the rosy tinge once painted on my cheeks now streaking as red trails down my neck . They would have to allow me twenty minutes to get myself back in order before the presentation . I would insist on it ! I studied my watch ; two hours had passed since entering the desert . I was hotter and more uncomfortable than I could remember feeling in years . The driver remained silent except for an occasional hum . It suddenly dawned on me : He had not introduced himself . Maybe I was n't in the correct vehicle ! But that was silly . I could n't get out , and he certainly seemed confident about me as a passenger . Four hours later , we pulled up to a corrugated tin structure . A small , smoldering fire burned outside , and two Aboriginal women stood up as we approached . They were both middle-aged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One wore a headband that made her thick , curly black hair escape at strange angles . They both appeared slim and athletic , with round , full faces holding bright brown eyes . As I descended from the jeep , my chauffeur said , " By the way , I am the only one who speaks English . I will be your interpreter , your friend . " " Great ! " I thought to myself . " I 've spent seven hundred dollars on airfare , hotel room , and new clothes for this introduction to native Australians , and now I find out they ca n't even speak English , let alone recognize current fashions . " Well , I was here , so I might as well try to blend in , although in my heart I knew I could not . The women spoke in blunt foreign sounds that did not seem like sentences , only single words . My interpreter turned to me and explained that permission to attend the meeting required I first be cleansed . I did not understand what he meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust and hot from the ride , but that did not seem to be his meaning . He handed me a piece of cloth , which I opened to discover had the appearance of a wraparound rag . I was told I needed to remove my clothing and put it on . " What ? " I asked , unbelieving . " Are you serious ? " He sternly repeated the instructions . I looked around for a place to change ; there was none . What could I do ? I had come too far and endured too much discomfort at this point to decline . The young man walked away . " Oh , what the heck . It will be cooler than these clothes , " I thought . So , as discreetly as possible , I removed my soiled new clothing , folded it neatly into a pile , and donned the native attire . I stacked my things on the nearby boulder , which only moments before had served as a stool for the waiting women . I felt silly in the colorless rag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " clothing . The young man reappeared . He , too , had changed clothing . He stood before me almost naked , having only a cloth wrapped around in swimming trunk fashion and barefoot , as were the women at the fire . He issued further instructions to remove everything : shoes , hose , undergarments , and all my jewelry , even the bobby pins holding my hair . My curiosity was slowly fading , and apprehension was taking over , but I did as told .
