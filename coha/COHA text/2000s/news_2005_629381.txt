<p> Hundreds of nursing homes in Texas and Louisiana had no evacuation plans , despite state requirements , or made arrangements that were doomed to fail during the chaos caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , a Houston Chronicle review has found . <p> Thousands of Gulf Coast nursing home residents faced preventable dangers because the safeguards meant to protect them were both ignored and inadequate , according to a Chronicle survey of 45 Texas nursing homes , a review of more than 80 evacuation plans and interviews with officials in Louisiana 's 63 parishes . <p> In fact , some of the most troubling scenes from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita - the elderly sweltering on buses without air conditioning , festering in ill-equipped shelters in schools and churches , or taking refuge in coastal zones vulnerable to another storm - were intended arrangements laid out in approved evacuation plans . <p> Regulations in Texas , Louisiana and at the federal level require all nursing homes to establish emergency plans that include arrangements for shelter , transportation and supplies to care for the elderly and frail , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurricanes . <p> In 2003 and 2004 , Houston-based nursing home inspectors sent letters warning nursing home officials to be ready for a major hurricane and asking for a copy of their evacuation plans . <p> Only 44 out of 130 nursing homes in hurricane-prone Brazoria , Galveston and Harris counties supplied them in 2004 , according to documents reviewed by the Chronicle . Most of those submitted had obvious problems , including at least two Harris County homes that planned to shelter at an out-of-business hospital . <p> No check and balance ' <p> In Louisiana , 14 parishes failed to meet the most basic of the state 's requirements : keeping a copy of homes ' evacuation plans on file at the emergency operation centers . Officials in more than half of its parishes acknowledged they conducted only a cursory review of plans because they were overburdened , lacked expertise or had no authority over homes . <p> " It was unorganized , and that is hard on old people . Young people can tolerate that , but older people ca n't . I slept for two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 79 , from Baytown , who watched another woman die during the evacuation . <p> Local and state officials in both Texas and Louisiana had ample warnings that nursing homes were ill-prepared before the devastating storms this year , according to documents and interviews from both states , but officials said they had little power to correct the problems . <p> " We see where there are gaping holes in our system , " said Louisiana Rep. Nita Hutter , from St. Bernard Parish , where 35 nursing home residents drowned because they were not evacuated . " It has become clear that no one was evaluating these plans in any real sense . The system provides no check and balance . " <p> The consequences of the lack of accountability were staggering : At least 140 residents died in nursing homes or during chaotic evacuations during Katrina . <p> Some 1,000 others were forced to flee twice because Hurricane Rita threatened their coastal shelters . Thousands of others were loaded into airplanes without records or caregivers and shipped out of state , where they were temporarily lost to their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without staff , and it becomes the responsibility of the local government that had no forewarning of who was coming or of what plans had been made , " said JoAnne Moreau , director of emergency preparedness for East Baton Rouge Parish , La. , which received hundreds of nursing home evacuees during Katrina . " It is incredibly stressful on our system . " <p> The reviews by both states are hampered by failures to communicate and a lack of authority . Authorities that license and regulate nursing homes check primarily to see that a plan exists but rarely review the plans or cite homes that do n't have them . <p> Lack of authority <p> Meanwhile , local emergency managers or other officials , who review nursing home plans voluntarily in Texas and by statute in Louisiana , say they can not force improvements in ineffective plans because they lack licensing authority . <p> Louisiana code requires nursing homes to submit an evacuation plan each year to the parish government , which is to review the viability of the plan . As part of its annual inspections , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan has been submitted . <p> But the two do not exchange information or work together . Although local officials said they had told dozens of homes they had inadequate evacuation plans , the Louisiana Department of Health &; Hospitals , which regulates and licenses nursing homes , has cited only one home in the past year for having an inadequate plan . <p> That statistic is staggering to Moreau , the director of emergency preparedness for East Baton Rouge Parish , who said she has told 23 out of the 28 homes in her parish that their plans are inadequate . <p> " It is our responsibility to review the plans , but when we do that and say they are inadequate , nothing happens , " Moreau said . <p> Texas officials are required to do even less than their counterparts in Louisiana . Nursing homes are supposed to have disaster plans on file at the facilities . In the past year , seven Texas homes have been cited for failing to have disaster plans , said Don Rogers , a spokesman for the Department of Aging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But nursing homes are not required to submit their plans to emergency managers for review . When Harris County asked nursing homes to submit plans voluntarily last year , only some complied . <p> Obvious problems <p> Of the 44 nursing home evacuation plans on file at the regional office of the DADS in Houston , many had problems . <p> The plans showed five homes planned to use school buses that had no air conditioning . Two had signed up with a company that had warned , " We can not be held liable for any injuries sustained to passengers that should be transported by vehicles for the disabled ... our vehicles are school buses with windows , no air conditioning . " <p> More than 10 nursing homes all planned to use the same bus service to evacuate - guaranteeing some would get none . Ambulance companies also had overcommitted , producing shortages , panic and last-ditch airlifts . <p> Sheltering plans contained other obvious flaws : 12 facilities planned to take residents to hospitals , mostly in low-lying coastal areas , and many others chose nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some of the plans were at least five years old . <p> When Hurricane Rita struck , even some of the most prepared nursing home administrators saw their arrangements fall apart , based on telephone interviews with 45 nursing home administrators who evacuated from Galveston , Harris and Brazoria counties . <p> Evacuation orders were mandatory in Galveston and Brazoria . But there was more confusion in Harris County , where not everyone was subject to the order . <p> In at least one case , a nursing home did not evacuate residents though county maps indicated it was vulnerable to flooding in a Category 4 hurricane - a decision that could have stranded the elderly if Hurricane Rita had directly hit Houston . Part of the problem was that local emergency managers did not have maps or lists of the most vulnerable homes in advance of the storm and therefore could not easily prioritize how to help them . <p> At least 18 other county nursing homes outside the flood zones did evacuate , adding dozens of ambulances and buses to an already tremendous traffic jam . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to scramble at the last minute to find alternative transportation . As ambulance and bus services ran out of vehicles , Houston officials requested an airlift out of Ellington Field to help people who had gotten stranded , many of them from hospitals and nursing homes in Pasadena and Baytown . <p> Busloads of dangers <p> The evacuation itself became almost as life-threatening as the storm . Busloads of overheated nursing home patients from highways on the north and west sides of Houston were rushed to emergency rooms . Scores of elderly and infirm people , many of whom were unused to sitting up for long periods , spent more than 24 hours traveling , often without adequate restrooms , food , water and medicine . <p> Ten local nursing home administrators reported 18 deaths during the evacuation process in the Chronicle survey - not counting the 23 who died when a bus of residents from a nursing home outside the danger zone caught fire near Dallas . Many others refused to answer the question . <p> The burden to pay for evacuation was crushing : Many paid $10,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week or less reported losses of more than $100,000 , according to the survey . <p> Even solid plans derailed <p> Barbara Garrett , the owner and operator of Baytown Nursing Home , had a strong plan both for shelter , ambulances and buses . But she waited in vain for the buses on Wednesday and Thursday before Hurricane Rita hit . Finally , people who could walk were loaded into school buses without air conditioning and eventually flown to Lubbock . <p> Garrett grew increasingly upset and called politicians and city officials for help with the remaining 14 bedridden patients . Ambulances finally arrived at 3 a.m . Friday . <p> The firefighters driving them brought bad news : They were needed to help with the evacuation in Beaumont . <p> " We stood in the driveway , and I said : Over my dead body , you 're taking these ambulances away , ' " she said . Her patients were taken to safety . <p> In Louisiana , dozens of nursing homes failed to evacuate before Hurricane Katrina , in part because the places they chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Sandler , director of a New Orleans nursing home , said his plans to evacuate to a facility in Baton Rouge fell apart several years ago when the place called to say it had committed to too many other homes . <p> " I scrambled and scrambled but could not find anything , " said Sandler , director of Maison Hospitalire . " Finally , I signed with a camping facility in Covington because I need to have something on paper before the state inspection . " <p> But when Hurricane Katrina threatened the city , Sandler would not take his residents to the campsite in the storm 's projected path . They sheltered at the home , on high ground in the French Quarter , but endured four days in the heat with dwindling supplies before buses arrived to evacuate them . <p> Jean Braly , 80 , and Doris Williams , 78 , evacuees from Maison , found the lack of preparations in New Orleans astounding . " We just heard , We 're going to Houston ' and No , we wo n't be back tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand mirror , sweater and a Danielle Steele book . <p> The pair landed in a nursing home on Galveston Island - and had to be evacuated again for Hurricane Rita . They ended up stuck on a bus in traffic for hours and then crowded in a nursing home full of evacuees . <p> A call for change <p> The lack of a centralized review of nursing home evacuations in Texas and Louisiana also contributed to problems for the places that housed evacuees , especially when nursing home residents arrived ill and without adequate staff and supplies . <p> " Homes in our parish may agree to host other homes , but we are not informed about those plans , " said Barbara Dupre , assistant director of emergency preparedness in Terrebonne Parish in southeast Louisiana . " When Rita came , we had a whole lot of people we had not anticipated ( needing ) to take care of . This is the sort of thing that we can not control . " <p> The major flaws in emergency planning have prompted calls for reform in both states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for on how our plans played out - what worked and what did n't , " said Joe Donchess , a nursing home lobbyist who played a critical role in coordinating nursing home rescues after Hurricane Katrina . " Now , we need to employ that to make some common-sense decisions about who is responsible for these people entrusted to our care . " <p> ... <p> SUGGESTIONS <p> Major flaws in emergency planning for nursing homes already have prompted calls for reform . Some proposals : <p> Add nursing home representatives to the state emergency command center in Texas . ( Already done in Louisiana . ) <p> Maintain a statewide nursing home bed inventory to track available emergency shelter space for hurricane season . <p> Make sure homes know before hurricane season whether they are in storm-surge or flood zones . <p> Make sure local emergency ambulance services have lists that prioritize which homes should be first to obtain emergency transportation . <p> Establish a medical emergency lane or procedure for granting priority to nursing home buses and ambulances in gridlock . <p> Coordinate FEMA ambulance networks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their transportation providers do n't show . <p> Discuss in advance emergency airlift procedures and figure out how to keep track of patients , medical records and medicines . <p> Make sure that too many facilities have not designated the same bus or ambulance company and require nursing homes to have backup transportation . <p> Prohibit nursing homes from designating facilities in storm-surge or flooding areas as their only backup shelter site . <p> Set up special-needs shelters statewide in university or college campuses with medical programs that can support them .
