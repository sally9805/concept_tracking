sleep no more By GREG ILES G. P. Putnam 's Sons Eve Sumner appeared on the first day of fall . Not the official first daythere was nothing official about Evebut the first day the air turned cool , blowing through John Waters 's shirt as though it were n't there . It was chilly enough for a jacket , but he did n't want one because it had been so hot for so damn long , because the air tasted like metal and his blood was up , quickened by the change in temperature and the drop in pressure on his skin , like a change in altitude . His steps were lighter , the wind carrying him forward , and deep within his chest something stirred the way the bucks were stirring in the deep woods and the high leaves were pulling at their branches . Soon those bucks would be stalked through the oaks and shot , and those leaves would be burning in piles , but on that day all remained unresolved , poised in a great ballet of expectation , an indrawn breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came Eve Sumner . She stood on the far sideline of the soccer field , too far away for Waters to really see her . He first saw her the way the other fathers did , a silhouette that caught his eye : symmetry and curves and a mane of dark hair that made the mothers on both sides of the soccer field irrationally angry . But he had n't time to notice more than that . He was coaching his daughter 's team . Seven-year-old Annelise raced along the sea of grass with her eye on the ball , throwingherself between eight-year-old boys nearly twice her size . Waters trotted along behind the pack , encouraging the stragglers and reminding the precocious ones which direction to kick the ball . He ran lightly for his age and sizea year past forty , an inch over six feetand he pivoted quickly enough to ensure soreness in the morning . But it was a soreness that he liked , that reminded him he was still alive and kicking . He felt pride following Annelise down the field ; last year his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ball ; this year , with her father coaching , she had found new confidence . He sensed that even now , so young , she was learning lessons that would serve her well in the future . " Out of bounds ? " he called . " Blue 's ball . " As the opposing team put the ball inbounds , Waters felt the pressure of eyes like fingers on his skin . He was being watched , and not only by the kids and their parents . Glancing toward the opposite sideline , he looked directly into the eyes of the dark-haired woman . They were deep and as dark as her hair , serene and supremely focused . He quickly averted his own , but an indelible afterimage floated in his mind : dusky , knowing eyes that knew the souls of men . The opposing coach was keeping time for the tied game , and Waters knew there was precious little left . Brandon Davis , his star eight-year-old , had the ball on his toe and was controlling it well , threading it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Annelise was close behind Brandon , trying to get into position to receive a pass as they neared the goal . Girls thought more about passing than boys ; the boys just wanted to score . But Annelise did the right thing all the same , flanking out to the right as Brandon took a vicious shot at the net . The ball ricocheted off the goalie 's shins , right back to Brandon . He was about to kick again when he sensed Annelise to his right and scooped the ball into her path , marking himself as that rarest of boys , one who understands deferred gratification . Annelise was almost too surprised by this unselfishness to react , but at the last moment she kicked the ball past the goalie into the net . A whoop went up from the near sideline , and Waters heard his wife 's voice leading the din . He knew he should n't show favoritism , but he could n't help running forward and hugging Annelise to his chest . " I got one , Daddy ! " she cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored ! " " You sure did . " " Brandon passed it to me ! " " He sure did . " Sensing Brandon behind him , Waters reached back and grabbed the boy 's hand and lifted it skyward along with Annelise 's , showing everyone that it was a shared effort . " Okay , de-lense ! " he shouted . His team raced back to get into position , but the opposing coach blew his whistle , ending the game with a flat , half-articulated note . The parents of Waters 's team streamed onto the field , congratulating the children and their coach , talking happily among themselves . Waters 's wife , Lily , trundled forward with the ice chest containing the postgame treats : POWERade and Oreos . As she planted the Igloo on the ground and removed the lid , a small tornado whirled around her , snatching bottles and blue bags from her hands . Lily smiled up from the chaos , silently conveying her pride in Annelise as male hands slapped Waters 's back . Lily 's eyes were cornflower blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In moments like this , she looked as she had in high school , running cross-country and beating all comers . The warmth of real happiness welled in Waters at the center of this collage of flushed faces , grass stains , skinned knees , and little Jimmy O'Brien 's broken tooth , which had been lost during the second quarter and was now being passed around like an artifact of a historic battle . " Hell of a season , John ! " said Brandon Davis 's father . " Only one more game to go . " " Today was a good day . " " How about that last pass ? " " Brandon 's got good instincts . " " You better believe it , " insisted Davis . " Kid 's got a hell of a future . Wait till AYA football starts . " Waters was n't comfortable with this kind of talk . In truth , he did n't much care if the kids won or lost . The point at this age was fun and teamwork , but it was a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the ball , " he said by way of excusing himself . He trotted toward the spot where the ball had fallen when the whistle blew . Parents from the opposing team nodded to him as they headed for their cars , and a warm sense of camaraderie filled him . This emerald island of chalked rectangles was where it was happening today in Natchez , a town of twenty thousand souls , steeped in history but a little at a loss about its future . In Waters 's youth , the neighborhoods surrounding these fields had housed blue-collar mill workers ; now they were almost exclusively black . Twenty years ago , that would have made this area off limits , but today there were black kids on his soccer team , a mark of change so profound that only people who had lived through those times really understood its significance . Before he knew why , Waters panned his eyes around the field , sensing an emptiness like that he felt when he sighted a cardinal landing outside his office window and , looking closer at the smear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quick beat of wings . He was looking for the dark-haired woman , but she was gone . He picked up the ball and jogged back to his group , which stood waiting for concluding remarks before splitting up and heading for their various neighborhoods . " Everybody played a great game , " he told them , his eyes on the kids as their parents cheered . " There 's only one more to go . I think we 're going to win it , but win or lose , I 'm taking everybody to McDonald 's after for a Happy Meal and ice cream . " " Yaaaaaay ! " screamed ten throats in unison . " Now go home and get that homework done ! " " Boooooooooo ! " The parents laughed and shepherded their kids toward the SUVs , pickups , and cars parked along the sideline . Annelise walked forward . " You blew it at the end , Daddy . " " You do n't have that much homework . " " No , but the third-graders have a lot . " Waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his wife and softly said , " Did we have homework in second grade ? " Lily leaned in close . " We did n't have homework until sixth grade . " " Yeah ? Well , we did all right . " He took Annelise 's hand and led her toward his muddy Land Cruiser . A newly divorced mother named Janie somebody fell in beside Lily and started to talk . Waters nodded but said nothing as Janie began a familiar litany of complaints about her ex . Annelise ran ahead , toward another family whose car was parked beside the Land Cruiser . Alone with his thoughts for the first time in hours , Waters took a deep breath of cool air and savored the between-ness of the season . Someone was grilling meat across the road , and the scent made him salivate . Turning toward the cooking smell , he saw the dark-haired woman walking toward him . She was twenty feet away and to his right , moving with fluid grace , her eyes fixed on his face . He felt oddly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now-empty soccer field . He was about to ask her if she 'd lost her keys when she tilted her head back and gave him a smile that nearly stopped him in his tracks . Waters felt a wave of heat rush from his face to his toes . The smile withheld nothing : her lips spread wide , revealing perfect white teeth ; her nostrils flared with feline excitement ; and her eyes flashed fire . He wanted to keep looking , to stop and speak to her , but he knew better . It 's often said that looking is okay , but no wife really believes that . He nodded politely , then looked straight ahead and kept moving until he passed her . Yet his mind could not recover as quickly as his body . When Lily leaned toward Janie to say something , he glanced back over his shoulder . The dark-haired woman was doing the same . Her smile was less broad now , but her eyes still teased him , and just before Waters looked away , her lips came together and formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other . " Soon , " she said without sound . And John Waters 's heart stopped . He was a mile from the soccer field before he really started to regain his composure . Annelise was telling a story about a scuffle between two boys at recess , and mercifully , Lily seemed engrossed . " Hey , we won , " she said , touching her husband 's elbow . " What 's the matter ? " Waters 's mind spun in neutral , searching for a reasonable explanation for his trancelike state . " It 's the EPA investigation . " Lily 's face tightened , and her curiosity died , as Waters had known it would . An independent petroleum geologist , Waters owned half of a company with more than thirty producing oil wells , but he now lived with a sword hanging over his head . Seventeen years of success had been thrown into jeopardy by a single well that might have leaked salt water into a Louisiana rice farmer 's fields . For two months , the EPA had been trying to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made potentially devastating by Waters 's business partner 's failure to keep their liability insurance up to date , and since the company was jointly owned , Waters would suffer equally if the EPA deemed the leak their fault . He could be wiped out . " Do n't think about it , " Lily pleaded . For once , Waters was n't . He wanted to speak of comforting trivialities , but none came to him . His composure had been shattered by a smile and a soundless word . At length , in the most casual voice he could muster , he said , " Who was that woman who looked at me when we were leaving ? " " I thought you were looking at her , " Lily said , proving yet again that nothing got by her . " Come on , babe ... she just looked familiar . " " Eve Sumner . " A definite chill in the voice . " She 's a real estate agent . " Now he remembered . Cole Smith , his partner , had mentioned Eve Sumner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but most of what Cole mentioned had a sexual context , or a sexual subtext . " I think Cole 's mentioned her . " " I 'll bet he has . Evie really gets around , from what I understand . " Waters looked over at his wife , wondering at the change in her . A few years ago , she never made this sort of comment . Or maybe she hadmaybe it was her tone that had changed . It held a bitterness that went along with the now-perpetual severity in her face . Four years ago , the smiling girlish looks that had lasted to thirty-five vanished almost overnight , and the bright eyes dulled to an almost sullen opacity . He knew the date by heart , though he did n't like to think about the reason . " How old is she ? " he asked . " How old did she look to you ? " Potential minefield . " Um ... forty-two ? " Lily snorted . " More like thirty-two . She probably wants to sell our house out from under us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our house is n't for sale . " " People like Eve Sumner think everything has a price . " " She sounds like Cole . " " I 'm sure they have a lot in common . " Lily cut her eyes at him in a way that as much as said , I 'm sure Cole has slept with her . Which was a problem for Waters , since his business partner wasnominally at leasta happily married father of three . But this was a problem he was accustomed to dealing with . Cole Smith had been cheating on his wife since the honeymoon ended , but he 'd never let it interfere with his marriage . Cole 's chronic philandering was more of a problem for Waters , who not infrequently found himself in the position of having to cover for a friend and partner whose actions he deplored . On another day he might have given a token grunt of skepticism in response to Lily 's assumption , but his patience with his partner had worn thin of late . He swung the Land Cruiser around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . There was a low-grade buzz deep in his brain , a hum of preoccupation set off by Eve Sumner 's smile but which had nothing to do with Eve Sumner . The smile on her face had risen straight from Waters 's past ; the word she 'd silently spoken echoed in a dark chamber of his heart . Soon .... " Damn , " he said under his breath . " What is it ? " asked Lily . He made a show of looking at his watch . " The Jackson Point well . Cole called and said it may come in about three in the morning . I 'm probably going to have to log it tonight . " Logging a well was the task of the geologist , who read complex measurements transmitted by an instrument lowered to the bottom of a newly drilled well in order to determine whether there was oil present . " There 's some stuff I need to do at the office before I go out to the rig . " Lily sighed . " Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You can make your phone calls from home . " Waters knew she had made this suggestion without much hope . Whenever he logged wells , he had a ritual of spending time alone . Most geologists did , and he was thankful for that today . " I wo n't be more than an hour , " he said , a twinge of guilt going through him . " I 'll drop you guys off and be home as quick as I can . " " Daddy ! " objected Annelise . " You have to help with my homework . " Waters laughed . His daughter needed no help with homework ; she just liked him sitting close by in the hour before bedtime . " I 'll be back before you know it . " " I know what that means . " " I promise , " he insisted . Annelise brightened . Her father kept his promises . * * * Lily and Annelise waved as Waters pulled away from Linton Hill , the house that was not for sale , an antebellum home he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in Franklin County . Linton Hill was n't a palace like Dunleith or Melrose , but it had four thousand square feet with detached slave quarters that Waters used as a home office , and many small touches of architectural significance . Since they moved in , Lily had been leading a one-woman campaign to have the house placed on the National Register of Historic Places , and victory seemed close . Having grown up in a clapboard house less than a mile from Linton Hill , Waters usually felt pride when he looked at his home . But today , watching his rearview mirror , he barely saw the place . As soon as Lily led Annelise up the steps , his mind began to run where it had wanted to for the past ten minutes . " I imagined it , " he murmured . But the old pain was there . Dormant for two decades , it remained stubbornly alive , like a tumor that refused to metastasize or to be absorbed . Waters gave the Land Cruiser some gas and headed downtown , toward the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great tunnel . Most houses here were tall Victorian gingerbreads , but there were also plain clapboards and even shotgun shacks . Natchez was a lot like New Orleans on this side : half-million-dollar mansions stood yards away from crumbling row houses that would n't bring thirty thousand . ( Continues ... )
