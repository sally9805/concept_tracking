Remember the childhood thrill of twirling in circles until the world spun wildly and you could n't stand on your feet ? That 's how many of my former patients described their disorienting bouts with dizziness  --  especially the elderly ones . As many as 38% of older Americans struggle to keep their world stationary , trying to avoid dangerous falls and potentially life-threatening injuries . Dizziness is so common among seniors that patients and their doctors tend to write it off as an inevitable consequence of aging . <P> That can be a big mistake , suggests a study published last week in the Annals of Internal Medicine . Dizziness can be caused by a wide variety of underlying conditions , some of them quite serious . Many of these conditions , if properly identified , can easily be treated . <P> In the new study , 1,000 elderly Americans were questioned closely about the frequency of their dizzy spells and the conditions that surrounded them .

This delicate and complicated stabilizing mechanism can be disrupted by everything from viral infections to structural injuries  --  as well as the slowed reflexes and lowered blood circulation that are a natural result of aging . Nothing can be done about that . <P> But dizziness can also be caused by a variety of treatable disorders , including degenerative joint disease in the neck , damaged blood vessels in the brain and cardiovascular illnesses , such as coronary-artery disease and a slow heartbeat . Identifying the culprit can be particularly difficult in older patients who commonly suffer from more than one health problem at a time . <P> You can help your doctors make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What were you doing before they happened ? How long did they last ? Were you nauseous or light headed ? What medications are you on ?

Better to be safe and schedule some time in the doctor 's office , answering questions and undergoing a quick exam . Bring your dizziness diary and be prepared for a complete physical exam that includes neurological and musculoskeletal testing . Before you accept the answer " You 're just getting old , " make sure the problem is n't something more serious . <P> Last year my colleague Christine Gorman expressed skepticism in this space about a report that night-lights could trigger nearsightedness in infants .
