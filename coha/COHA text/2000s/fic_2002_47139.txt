On that night , years back , we were up until the cardinals started calling . The first one lit out through the leaves before the air went from warm to hot . I remember that the call sounded lonely in the quiet of early morning . But soon , just before it got light , many of them were fussing in the poplars outside Evvie 's porch . The sky was turning bright behind the kudzu that was taking over the back fence . Evvie had poured more of whatever she drank with her coffee and lay lengthwise on the porch glider . Her legs were crossed in my lap . When I ran my fingers around each toe , she broke from humming to herself , and her lips pulled tight against her teeth . She breathed like the breathing was getting her off . She breathed like that when she came , hours earlier , when I had her bent over the back of the glider on her porch . <p> That 's how she makes me say it now-bent over , entered from behind-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it if I say doggy-style . When I first caught up with her today , I tried that out  --  just to joke , like we used to do-but she looked dead at me and sucked her teeth . It ai n't like that now , she said , no shame in her face . Evvie tells me not to say things like sweetmeat and assfuck . She says she 'd rather not talk about sex at all . But years back , when I massaged her feet , she dribbled her drink , opened her mouth , and let her neck go slack , face to the sky . Her teeth were slick with the wet of her tongue . And I figured all that had to do with me . <p> But there was a lot to that night . When the sun had been down a while , the sky was still bright with red and purple , like the whole dusk was swollen . The air was wet . Clouds were thick and hung close to the hills . Like early morning , those birds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's place , the cicadas were buzzing as it got dark . You know what that 's all about , Evvie would say . Even now , that buzz goes through me like an emotion , everywhere at once . It sounds like spring works : from inside your middle . By early morning we 'd been at it all over the house : couch , rocker , hallway floor , twice in the bathtub . <p> Later , we sat in the mist as it blew across her porch . The scent of turned earth was on the air . I was thinking that the wind was horny , just like everything else in early June . Breeze blew through where the kudzu was thick enough to round the sharp corners of the fence . The wind pushed the vines from their tangle and fanned them out into the yard . When the kudzu moved like that , it looked like something large and hungry was rolling around inside . Sometimes I imagined there was something scrambling through the vines . Sometimes I was sure of it : a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or threw back in there . But I never saw anything , just breeze through vine . There was a hum to the breeze , a soft heave from the greenery . Above where the vines covered the top of the fence , the night was near quiet , but had a low sigh , just like that heave . And above all of that we could hear the Bensons , her upstairs neighbors , fucking again . <p> We listened to their couch scoot in short scrapes along the floor above Evvie 's front room ceiling . The Bensons were both talkers . They made love the way they argued . He was sweetie 's big daddy , she was his fat-back baby , on and on like that . Day was coming , and they were wearing out their front-room couch . We could hear them from her porch , in the back of the building . I was nodding in and out of sleep . But Evvie listened . She had her lips open , and for a moment she held her breath . In the stillness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Benson : You gettin ' it now , sugar . It 's right there ... get it right there ! Something splintered and shook the ceiling . And Evvie let out her breath . <p> When I ask her about that now , she says she was sighing back to the night air . <p> " I used to do things like that , " she says . <p> " You still do , " I say , like I have any idea what she 's doing now . <p> She smiles at this , sips on her drink , looks along the bar . <p> There 's a downward turn to her lips , like whatever she 's looking at in this place disappoints her . She has n't been here for a while . Macky 's Mellowtone Grill is the same as it was three years ago . Vinyl-rimmed bar and tables , six wood booths , the same color as the red that Dessa , the owner , painted the whole place . Even before Dessa took over , I never knew the inside of Macky 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a long bar . Beer signs between pictures of Booker T. , Dr. King , and Garvey ; Nancy Wilson above the jukebox . There was n't a bar display , liquor bottles lit up and all that , but if you asked for something , Dessa would pour it . The jukebox never played new tunes , but stopped playing the oldest , about one album at a time . I brought Evvie by here to see the fellas , shout Hey to Dessa . <p> Evvie gets up to pick songs on the jukebox , and it 's only then that I see what I could n't make sense of when we bumped into each other earlier . She looks like she never came from here : headwrap , bangles , toe rings , and something like a sheet or a big robe brushing the tops of her feet . <p> " It 's a caftan , " she says when Dessa stares long enough . <p> " Your money , not mine " is all Dessa says . <p> I ran into Evvie at the barber 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking out of Willie 's shop when I was walking in . The whole room was busting out in laughter . It was like she had never left Watertown . I heard her voice first , a laugh that 's deep from in her chest and loose , wide-mouthed , like a child 's . I expected to see her in nursing scrubs . She used to spend half her days in them . When I 'd pick her up from her shift , we 'd go straight to Macky 's , and although the fellas saw me with her , looking like that , it did n't matter to me . She wore thong underwear underneath . Just for you , baby , she used to tell me . She knew I liked that kind of secret . Three years since I 've seen that woman . <p> When I ran into her outside Willie 's , I saw that caftan covering her and wondered what was under all that . Somewhere in there was her body , but when I tried to give her a hug , she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cloth than hip . I could n't feel if she was bigger or more bony . Before anything else I said , Let 's drink something . We walked to the car as quiet and shy as prom dates . We were silent most of the way to the bar . <p> I looked at her while I was driving . She watched the streets go by . She was fanning the hem of the caftan between her knees . Still do n't have air conditioning , she laughed out the window . Most folks wear less when the sun 's out , I said , and she sucked her teeth , rolled her eyes , gave me that shows-what-you-know look . The next time I looked she had the hem pulled to her thighs . There was a scar of raised skin along the outside of her knee . She had been an athlete : volleyball , basketball , track ; the baby girl in a house of three brothers over six feet . The knee gave out on her at regionals ; the slower girl she had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year later , she won the Tennessee state finals for long jump . The skin around that scar ran to her thigh ; her muscles were taut , like she was always ready to sprint . It 's been a while since I saw that , I said . She was looking out the window , letting the air rushing past the car push against her palm . When she turned to me , I was trying to laugh , but she was n't smiling . <p> She was the one who first got me talking that way . Hints and taunts that led to clothes on the kitchen floor and sweat on the counters . That 's what I wanted to say after we had our drinks and found a booth in Macky 's . Years back , she liked to tell me to tell her what I wanted to do . I tried to talk the way she wanted . At first , I was n't that creative . We 'd get a few drinks in us , and I 'd push the dishes into the sink so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baby , I 'd say , and when she 'd say , I 've been wet since you pulled out this morning , I would smile like a wallflower until I could think of what to say next . <p> As I got smoother with the smooth talk , I 'd leave messages on her beeper when she was on lunchbreak , something like , Do n't be wearing nothing but oil when I get home . I did it just for laughs . But she 'd knock off work a bit early and be sitting on her front porch with a robe on and a glass of rum by the time I got there . Or I 'd see a note on her screen door-Got your message-and I could smell sandalwood oil drifting from inside , like the whole house was waiting for me . For a while it was good like that . <p> Not long after , the Bensons moved in upstairs . The first time we met them , they were going at it outside Evvie 's apartment . We heard them before we saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrestling on the stairs to the upper floors . We walked up the steps to Evvie 's door , and there they were , in the stairwell . Her heels were in the middle of the landing . We said , Ev'nin ; and he pulled his hand from her skirt . They nodded back . He patted her ass with the heels as they went up the stairs . <p> They played the same record all night . Albert King on into the early hours . The Bensons were louder than their stereo . Whatever got them horny got into us , too . That night , Evvie and I almost broke her dining-room table . After a month , it was like that every weekend , two or three times on Saturdays alone . Evvie got to listening for them : if I was fucking her , hearing them pushed her to yelling herself , or , if it was sometime between the last and the next time I was fucking her , she started touching herself . <p> After a few weeks of that , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling her how I was going to do her . Listen , she would say , and gaze at the ceiling . Above , Mr. Benson was making damn sure Mrs. Benson knew who her ass belonged to , or Mrs. Benson let Mr. Benson know damn well where her sugar bowl was : No , baby , you just watch this time , watch how I do it . Evvie 's eyes would be closed , her hand over my mouth , her legs going tight , quivering into her own good time . You just watch how I do myself Because they went at it late at night , we were up , too . By the time the sun was shining from the front room down the hall , we were on Evvie 's back patio with the glider cushions spread out on the deck . The Bensons would be just above where her bedroom let onto the patio . Before the paper hit the front porch , we had been back in the shower and sweaty all over again on her front-room couch . <p> Unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , playing Carla Thomas 45 's over the rattle of a sewing machine . I never did figure out what Mr. Benson did . <p> It got to be that we spent most nights at Evvie 's . Late at night I would wake up to the carrying on upstairs . Sometimes what they said did n't make sense . Just shouting and hollering . I 'd wake out of dreams and wonder what the hell was I hearing . From my dream it sounded like somebody 's pet locked in a closet , but then I 'd hear her say , Got-damn , Ronnie , get it , baby , something like that , and I 'd remember what it was . I 'd look to see if Evvie was asleep , and her eyes would be wide open to the ceiling . On some nights she would mouth whatever it was the Bensons said the most . When I finally said to her , You never bust out when we get it on like that , she said , We never get it on like that . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . We did n't argue or get cold with each other . It just seemed like more nights we slept or listened to the Bensons . Then it was more nights we either fell asleep , or I was n't over there . Eventually , Evvie stopped calling every day , and I found myself at Macky 's most weekends , watching the ball game . I told myself it was because the Braves were good that year . A few months later , folks stopped seeing Evvie around town . When Dessa finally asked me where Evvie had run off to , I said west . That 's all her phone message said . Dessa said , That ai n't too damn specific , and I said , That 's Evvie . <p> Some weeks after that I ran into Mr. Benson at Macky 's . He was running nine-ball over some kid who did n't have sense enough not to bring his two-weeks ' pay to a bar . Mr. Benson did n't say much more than Which hole you want me to put the nine , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1983 : dressed sharp in leisure suit combos and two-color Stacy Adams patent leathers , blue-tinted eyeglasses , geri-curls long in back , close above his ears . Between games he 'd lean into the bar while Dessa freshened up his Johnnie Walker . <p> I eased up , yelled to Della , I got his , and pour me double whatever it is this brother drinks . He looked my way , saw that we knew each other , and turned back to stare at himself in the mirror that ran along the bar . I told his reflection , If it 's the drink that keeps your lady and mine up at night , I got ta try some of that shit . Mr. Benson tipped his glass to our reflections in the long bar mirror before he turned to the pool table-It ai n't the drank . <p> After that he ran five games of nine-ball on me . He only spoke to call a pocket or ball combination . When he was done , and I had bought him a double at the bar , he tipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow-tooth grin , The lady just likes what I got and likes it a long time . He did n't say another word , and I did n't ask anything else . <p> Evvie looks like she wants to go . We have n't said much : traded news about friends and laughed a little about my brickhead nephews . She gets up to put more money in the jukebox . <p> " The Teddy Pendergrass do n't play no more , " Dessa shouts . " You wore that out , Evylyn . ' <p> Evvie lets out that wide mouth laugh . She bends over , like she 's going to laugh herself to the floor . Her hands go to her waist , and I can see where her hips begin . For a minute I think maybe the head-wrap and caftan are a joke and any moment she 's going to throw that off and ask me to dance close , my thigh between hers , and it wo n't matter what 's playing on the jukebox . She sees me watching . She watches me sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up . <p> " You still funny , girl , " Evvie says to Dessa , and by the time she 's back to the booth , her smile is gone . <p> We sit for a while , waiting for Dessa 's sorry jukebox to find something that plays . I can hear the empty record slots , clicking , clicking . Evvie keeps her eyes to the street . <p> When I ask her where she 's been all this time , she tells me that she 's been traveling . <p> " I just drove , " she says . <p> " Drove another brother crazy , right ? " I laugh . <p> She is n't laughing . " Drove west . Drove north . Away from here , " she says . <p> " Lookin ' for your gold-tooth sugar daddy . " <p> " See , that 's your problem , " she says . " Got shit figured out before you know shit about it . " <p> I do n't say anything to this . <p> " Maybe if you paid attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . ' <p> Now it 's me who feels like leaving . <p> She tells me how for a long time she did n't call anybody in Watertown , or any of her kin in Tennessee . Months before she left , she took to saying I live in Watertown , but it do n't live in me . Bars and beauty salons were the only happening places around where we lived . Beyond that , Watertown was rail yards , half of downtown boarded up , industrial parks , and neighborhoods where white folks only allowed us in to clean . Once a year , the city would put on a blues festival on Eleventh Street-five bands , barbeque , cold beer , and card games all day-and folks would almost get to thinking that there was n't much else to look forward to . When she had enough , Evvie drove the hell out of here . <p> I ask her whose bed she was sleeping in all this time . <p> " Did n't matter where I woke up , " she says , " motel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just me , by myself . That got to feeling good . Was n't nobody next to me but me . ' Then she looks dead at me . " Whose bed was I in ? You mean who was I fucking . You really got to know that ? " And then she told me more than I wanted to know . At first she was using her fingers . Then she tried some toys . She took an art class , made something out of day , thick with ridges ; it had a curve to it , and she thought that was like me , but after a while , she said she did n't need it . Threw it away in a Waffle House dumpster . <p> She made her way farther south than Watertown . South , she says , just south . Maybe it was in Georgia where she found a way to stay in somebody 's house for a while . She did n't say if they were kin or not . Just a house in the middle of trees and heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather wood . She did n't say how she paid for things , but after some months , she burned her scrubs and nursing shoes in a trash can . <p> " Thongs , too , " she tells me , like that 's the part I should laugh at . After all of that , I try to lighten things up . When I ask Evvie who she 's fucking now , she does n't answer right away . She sucks her teeth again , pats her head-wrap , looks at her hands . <p> " I did n't have no place or nobody . I had my car key , one key , on my chain for a whole year , " and when she says chain , there 's a drop in her voice like I have n't heard since she called 4:30 , some Sunday morning , early in the first year after she left town . She had her drink on : loud , sassy , sloppy . In the background , I could hear a car engine rumbling . Maybe it was a truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold as hell place . She was yelling at me . She 'd go on for a while , and I 'd try to say something to calm her , but I did n't try to say all that much . It was 4:30 in the morning . <p> In the background , I could hear some woman laughing a sludge-thick smoker 's heave that begins with a chuckle and ends with that shit they never hack up . It seemed to me that this woman knew Evvie . Fuck that nigga , Evylyn , she kept laughing . I could n't tell if she was laughing at me , like she had me figured , or just laughing at Evvie , drunk on the phone and yelling at some man in Tennessee . She probably had that figured , too . I tried to tell Evvie to call me back when she was alone . She told me she was getting free of her chain , all those nowhere brothers . When I asked her what did all that have to do with me , there was a silence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold where she was . After a while , I hung up . <p> When Al Green comes on the jukebox , I say , " That 's my jam , " and I get up to get us more drinks . From the bar I watch her mouthing the words . She looks out the window , to Eleventh Street : folks walking from downtown , home to work , brothers gathered outside the bar , shit-talking about last night 's game . She lets her head bop a little , a small sway of her hand back and forth in the air , like she 's a backup singer . The song fades , and she 's still looking out the window . I stand at the bar longer than I should , but she never looks my direction . Dessa comes from behind the bar to have a smoke . She 's looking at Evvie , too . <p> " What did you do to that girl ? " she laughs . <p> I do n't know what to tell Dessa . Last time I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Affiliation
