This column does not replace your doctor 's advice . Dear Dr. Cory : How do we get colds ? Can you also get them in the summer ? Amber B. Tooele , Utah Dear Amber : Colds are caused by viruses . When a person with a cold breathes , sneezes , or coughs , little droplets of saliva or mucus that contain the virus come out of the nose or mouth . These virus-containing droplets are then in the air , waiting for the next person to breathe them in through their nose or mouth . Once that happens , the virus can infect that person . You can also catch a cold virus by touching something that someone with a cold has touched , coughed or sneezed on . Cold viruses can live for several hours on objects such as toys , furniture , or eating utensils . Another way to catch the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold viruses can live on hands for more than twenty minutes . Unfortunately , we can get colds anytime of the year . However , we seem to get them more during the winter months probably because we are inside more and in close contact with other people . Handwashing and getting plenty of exercise , rest , and a wide variety of nutritious foods will help keep you from getting sick . People who are " run down " are more likely to get sick . See the difference handwashing makes ! With the help of your parents , blanch // slices of a raw potato in boiling water for one minute . While the potato slices are cooling , go outside and touch a lot of things . When the slices are cool , rub your fingers on a slice and place it in a plastic sealed bag marked " unwashed . " Then wash your hands , rub your fingers on another potato slice , and place it in a separate plastic bag marked " washed " Check the bags in a few days and compare the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell your parents when shopping for supplies to look for nonantibacterial soaps . Researchers believe the use of antibacterial soaps and other products is adding to the growing problem of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotic medicines . Dear Dr. Cory : Can someone catch allergies ? For example , if my friend had allergies and she hugged me , would I get her allergies ? Saramma K. New York , New York Dear Saramma : // Allergies are not contagious , meaning you can not pass them from one person to another . In people with allergies , the body reacts to an allergen like it is something trying to cause an illness . Allergens are certain objects or chemicals such as pollen , dust , mold , and some foods or drugs that bring on , or trigger , allergies . When the body comes in contact with an allergen , it makes antibodies to that allergen . The antibody starts the allergic process . It causes mast cells to release chemicals such as histamine . This causes allergy symptoms like sneezing , runny nose , watery eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why some people get allergies and others do not . However , if your parents have allergies , there 's a good chance that you will , too . Dear Dr. Cory : I feel and look fat , but everyone tells me that I 'm not . I am on the average scale , but I still feel fat . Why do you think that is ? Tori T. Arlington , Texas Dear Tori : Preteens often gain weight and look a little chubby . This is in preparation for a big growth spurt . When your growth spurt occurs , you should begin to feel taller and slimmer . Growth charts help your doctor determine a healthy weight for you . He looks at several factors , including your height , weight , body type , age , and sex . You do need to watch what foods you eat . Eating more calories than you can use causes weight problems . It is important to eat a variety of foods that will help your body reach its fullest potential . Concentrate on eating foods that are low in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whole-grain breads and cereals are good choices . Food labels can be helpful . Check them carefully to see just how much fat and how many calories you are eating . Avoid soft drinks and fried foods such as French fries and chips . Drink water often . Eat dairy products such as low-fat milk , yogurt , and cheese . Studies of adults on weight-reduction diets have shown that a minimum of four low-fat dairy servings a day , along with daily exercise , can decrease the amount of fat and increase the amount of muscle in the body . Exercise is an important part of weight control . When muscles are used , they burn calories . The more muscle you have , the more calories you burn . Children your age need to be physically active at least 60 minutes , and up to several hours , a day . This activity does not have to be all at once but spread out over the day . Your exercise should include a wide variety of physical activities such as bike riding , swimming , or chores around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like walking to and from school and taking the stairs instead of the elevator . It 's fine to participate in a team sport , but you also need to find a sport that you can enjoy throughout life , such as tennis .
