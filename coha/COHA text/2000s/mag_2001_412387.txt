A gallery of observations <p> Like many places since Sept. 11 , the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum in Washington , D.C. , feels like a different world . Security guards wearing latex gloves use batons to comb through handbags , searching for suspicious packages or powdery substances . <p> In one of the first-floor exhibition halls , it 's also a different world , but an uplifting one . An ambitious display has replaced a long-time exhibit about the nature of stars . <p> " I was never really thrilled with it , " says curator David DeVorkin . " It was OK . It told why we go into space , but it was outdated quickly . And it was n't inspirational . " <p> In developing a new astronomy exhibit for the 4,600-square-foot gallery , DeVorkin hit upon a unifying theme : the instruments built to observe the cosmos . With the Smithsonian 's vast collection of astronomical equipment , both old and new , " we can show the real thing , " says DeVorkin . <p> " Unlike most museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're interested in the products , the instruments that form the legacy of the discoveries , " he adds . <p> Although it was a theorist , Copernicus , who made the revolutionary claim in the early 1500s that the sun , not Earth , was at the center of the solar system , the idea did n't catch on for decades , notes DeVorkin . Only late in the 16th century , when the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe developed planet-tracking tools and made the critical observations , was Copernicus proved right . <p> " When you build new tools of perception , you discover new universes , " notes DeVorkin . " It 's always been that way , it 's always going to be that way . And it also means that there 's no definitive answers to the nature of the universe . <p> " So , what I hope is that people who come through , rather than accumulating book knowledge by memorizing tables and facts , will get an impression of what it was like to observe the heavens at a particular moment in history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went from asking one set of questions about the universe to the next . " <p> Here 's a sampling of the exhibit , which opened in September and will remain permanently at the Air and Space Museum : Looking with the naked eye <p> Before 1609 , when Galileo began using a brand new invention called the telescope , humankind 's perception of the cosmos was limited to what could be seen with the naked eye . It was natural to perceive Earth as the center of the universe , with a transparent , starry sphere rotating around it . <p> The earliest astronomers used several tools to chart the position of objects in the sky and to predict where the sun , moon , and certain stars would move . With the heavens serving as both timekeeper and navigational aid , such knowledge was of much more than scholarly interest . <p> One measuring device , the astrolabe , had two parts . Its back contained a moveable sighting arm and a scale for measuring altitude , while the front had a flattened map of the heavens that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An astrolabe featured in the exhibit dates from A.D. 1090 and has several interchangeable plates , each engraved with the celestial coordinates for a different latitude . Pointers on the top plate indicate the locations of 22 bright stars . Like a modern star-finder chart , the top plate rotates to show where these stars would lie at different times of the year . <p> With this device , astronomers and others could predict when the sun and certain bright stars would rise or set on any given day . <p> As measuring devices became more and more precise , old notions about the universe began to crumble . For example , Brahe 's measurements-even though they were made with the naked eye-were fine enough to reveal that comets move through the same region of space as the planets . That destroyed the idea that planets occupied a special place that no other object could penetrate . A telescopic view <p> Soon after Brahe 's death , Galileo introduced the telescope to astronomy , leaving behind naked-eye observations . In time , investigators built bigger and better telescopes . A 20-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of modern cosmology , says DeVorkin . " It 's the most significant single piece of astronomical equipment we have in here that 's complete , " he notes . <p> Built by English astronomer William Herschel , the telescope enabled him to peer deeper into space than anyone had before . Using the data to develop theories about the size and structure of the universe , Hershel was the first observational cosmologist . <p> " At the time , people were only looking at the dynamics of the solar system , but Herschel had another agenda , " says DeVorkin . " He wanted to know what the rest of the universe was like . " <p> Herschel 's telescope consisted of a single mirror , mounted at the bottom of the instrument 's long , wooden tube , that bounced light up to an eyepiece on the opposite end . He peered into the eyepiece from a platform that could be raised or lowered . " It almost looked like he was speaking into a trashcan , " says DeVorkin . <p> With the telescope sitting just outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stars and call out the data to his sister Caroline , who sat by an open window and diligently recorded them . <p> During Herschel 's time , astronomers considered the Milky Way to be just a band of light-formed by faint stars and dust-that stretched across the sky . Observing as much of the heavens as he could see from England , Herschel produced a map of the Milky Way . <p> Carefully tracking stars for months to years , he discovered double stars-two stars that orbit each other , locked in a gravitational embrace . The finding demonstrated that the pairs of stars move in accordance with Newton 's law of gravitation , " extending the law farther into space than ever before , " notes DeVorkin . <p> Mysterious smudges of light , known as nebulas , held a particular fascination for Herschel . He wondered if they were part of the Milky Way band , perhaps solar systems in the making , or objects far beyond the Milky Way band . Before Herschel 's work , only about 100 of these fuzzy patches of light were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nebulas might be clouds of material that would condense to form stars or were themselves clumps of stars . <p> In 1833 , a few years after William Herschel died , his son John took the telescope to South Africa . There he completed his father 's work by mapping the distribution of stars and nebula over the Southern Hemisphere . <p> But it would take several decades , and a more powerful telescope , to determine that the nebulas are spiral shaped , and more than a century to figure out that they reside far beyond the Milky Way . The expanding universe <p> Seated in the observing cage of the 100-inch Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena , Calif. , Edwin Hubble was the first to realize just how expansive the universe is . <p> In 1923 , while observing the Andromeda nebula , he found that it contained a Cepheid variable , a star that regularly varies in brightness . Hubble and his colleagues were elated by the finding because they knew it would enable them to accurately measure the distance to Andromeda . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henrietta Swan Leavitt of the Harvard College Observatory , had shown that the brighter the Cepheid , the longer its period of pulsation . By measuring the duration of its pulse cycle , researchers could determine the star 's true brightness , which is akin to determining the wattage of a light bulb . Comparing a Cepheid 's true brightness with its dim brightness in the sky , they could then find how far away the star must lie . <p> By studying the Cepheid in Andromeda , Hubble found that the nebula was so distant that it must lie outside our Milky Way . That suggested that Andromeda , as well as other spiral nebula , were themselves galaxies . The Milky Way is not alone , he realized , but one of countless galaxies in a cosmos far vaster than most astronomers had ever imagined . <p> As a cosmic yardstick for measuring the distances to galaxies , Cepheids have proven invaluable . Launched in 1989 , the Hubble Space Telescope , which was named in honor of Edwin Hubble , has detected Cepheids farther away than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of the universe . <p> In 1929 , Hubble made a second revolutionary finding , this time with the help of the relatively new science of spectroscopy . Just as motion changes the pitch of a sound wave , it can change the length of a light wave . Light emitted by an object moving away from Earth appears to have its wavelengths stretched , or lengthened , as indicated by its spectrum . The faster the object moves the greater the shift . <p> By examining the shifts in spectra from a great many galaxies , Hubble discovered that galaxies were fleeing from each other , with the farthest ones receding the most rapidly . Now known as Hubble 's law , this finding provided the first observational evidence that the universe is n't static , but instead expands over time . Pigeons and the Big Bang <p> In the late 1940s , the Russian CmigrC George Gamow and two younger physicists developed a theory about the origin of the chemical elements and how the universe began . Gamow and his colleagues , Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over from the explosive event , now known as the Big Bang , that sparked the expanding universe and forged several of the lightest elements . <p> The team predicted that a sensitive enough telescope should be able to detect that relic heat , which the researchers calculated to have a temperature of about 5 kelvins . <p> Gamow adopted the word ylem ( pronounced eye-lem ) , an ancient word meaning primordial substance , for the stuff from which the universe was made . Known for his sense of humor , Gamow slapped a new label on a bottle of Cointreau liqueur , rechristening it ylem . <p> By the 1960s , most researchers had forgotten about Gamow 's prediction that a tiny amount of heat left over from the Big Bang should still be aglow in the universe today . But Robert Dicke of Princeton University and his colleagues arrived at a similar conclusion and in the early 1960s began searching for the background glow using a radio-wave detector mounted on the roof of a Princeton building . <p> At about the same time , Arno Penzias and Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cataloguing all known sources of radio emissions from space in an effort to improve satellite communications . They soon encountered a puzzle , however . Some radio static persisted no matter where in the sky they pointed their radio antenna , which was shaped like a large horn . Pigeons had taken to roosting in the antenna , and Penzias and Wilson thought that heat from the bird droppings might be the source of the static . Trapping the pigeons did n't solve the problem , however . <p> Ultimately , the researchers were forced to conclude that a faint microwave hiss bathed the entire sky . By accident , Penzias and Wilson had discovered the cosmic microwave background-the Big Bang 's latent heat . The energy of the radiation is equivalent to that emitted by a material at about 3 kelvins . <p> " Boys , we 've been scooped ! " said Dicke when he heard the news . <p> For their landmark finding , Penzias and Wilson won a Nobel Prize in Physics . The discovery , which helped to confirm the Big Bang model , spurred a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in finer and finer detail in their effort to understand the origin of the universe . The digital era <p> The proliferation of tools for observing the heavens has itself reached astronomical proportions . Various telescopes , spectrometers , particle detectors , and other gadgetry-some earthbound and some on spacecraft-can measure virtually any wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation and most of the other physical or chemical phenomena the cosmos can muster . Computer-controlled telescopes automatically record terabytes of data from the sky . Some of the newest instruments are revealing a cosmic puzzle that astronomers are still trying to comprehend : Not only is the universe expanding , as Hubble showed in the 1920s , but it 's doing so at an ever-faster rate . As Smithsonian curator DeVorkin likes to remind visitors , every instrument enlarges our view of the universe . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Herschel mapped the Milky Way with this telescope , which dates from the 1790s . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Above : The 100-inch Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory .
