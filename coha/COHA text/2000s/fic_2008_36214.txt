The Crack Cocaine Diet <p> I had just broken up with Brandon and Molly had just broken up with Keith , so we needed new dresses to go to this party where we knew they were both going to be . But before we could buy the dresses , we needed to lose weight because we had to look fabulous , kiss-my-ass-fuck-you fabulous . <p> **49;769;TOOLONG fabulous . Because , after all , Brandon and Keith were going to be at this party , and if we could n't get new boyfriends in less than eight days , we could at least go down a dress size and look so good that Brandon and Keith and everybody else in the immediate vicinity would wonder how they ever let us go . I mean , yes , technically , they broke up with us , but we had been thinking about it , weighing the pros and cons . ( Pro : they spent money on us . Con : they were childish . Pro : we had them . Con : tiny dicks , see above . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all impulsive , the way guys are . That would be another con  --  poor impulse control . Me , I never do anything without thinking it through very carefully . Anyway , I 'm not sure what went down with Molly and Keith , but Brandon said if he wanted to be nagged all the time , he 'd move back in with his mother , and I said , " Well , given that she still does your laundry and makes you food , it 's not as if you really moved out , " and that was that . No big loss . <p> Still , we had to look so great that other guys would be punching our exes in the arms and saying , " What , are you crazy ? " Everything is about spin , even dating . It 's always better to be the dumper instead of the dumpee , and if you have to be the loser , then you need to find a way of being superior . And that was going to take about seven pounds for me , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my discipline and had been doing some serious breakup eating for the past three weeks . She went facedown in the Ding Dongs , danced with the Devil Dogs , became a Ho Ho ho . As for myself , I 'm a salty girl , and I admit I had the Pringles Light can upended in my mouth for a couple of days . <p> So , anyway , Molly said Atkins , and I said not fast enough , and then I said a fast-fast , and Molly said she saw little lights in front of her eyes the last time she tried to go no food , and she said cabbage soup and I said it gives me gas , and then she said pills , and I said all the doctors we knew were too tight with their scrips , even her dentist boss since she stopped blowing him . And , finally , Molly had a good idea and said : " Cocaine ! " <p> This merited consideration . Molly and I had never done more than a little recreational coke , always provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my short-term experience indicated it would probably do the trick . The tiniest bit revved you up for hours and you raced around and around , and it was n't that you were n't hungry , more like you had never even heard of food , it was just some quaint custom from the olden days , like square dancing . I mean , you could do it in theory , but why would you ? <p> " Okay , " I said . " Only where do we get it ? " After all , we 're girls , girly girls . I had been drinking and smoking pot since I was sixteen , but I certainly did n't buy it . That 's what boyfriends were for . Pro : Brandon bought my drinks , and if you do n't have to lay out cash for alcohol , you can buy a lot more shoes . <p> Molly thought hard , and Molly thinking was like a fat guy running  --  there was a lot of visible effort . <p> " Well , like , the city . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On , like , a corner . " <p> " Right , Molly . I watch HBO , too . But I mean , what corner ? It 's not like they list them in that crap Weekender Guide in the paper  --  movies , music , clubs , where to buy drugs . " <p> So Molly asked a guy who asked a guy who talked to a guy , and it turned out there was a place just inside the city line , not too far from the interstate . Easy on , easy off , then easy off again . Get it ? After a quick consultation on what to wear  --  jeans and T-shirts and sandals , although I changed into running shoes after I saw the condition of my pedicure  --  we were off . Very hush-hush because , as I explained to Molly , that was part of the adventure . I phoned my mom and said I was going for a run . Molly told her mom she was going into the city to shop for a dress , and we were off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given us directions to what turned out to be an apartment complex , which was kind of disappointing . I mean , we were expecting rowhouses , slumping picturesquely next to each other , but this was just a dirtier , more run-down version of where we lived , little clusters of two-story townhouses built around a courtyard . We drove around and around and around , trying to seem very savvy and willing , and it looked like any apartment complex on a hot July afternoon . Finally , on our third turn around the complex , a guy ambled over to the car . <p> " What you want ? " <p> " What you got ? " I asked , which I thought was pretty good . I mean , I sounded casual but kind of hip , and if he turned out to be a cop , I had n't implicated myself . See , I was always thinking , unlike some people I could name . <p> " Got American Idol and Survivor . The first one will make you sing so pretty that Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel as if you 've got immunity for life . " <p> " O-kay . " Molly reached over me with a fistful of bills , but the guy backed away from the car . <p> <br> Continues ...
