<p> As diverting as the Australian Open was last month during its 100th anniversary , it was hard to forget the guests who never made it to the party . Among the absentees were last year 's women 's champion , Justine Henin-Hardenne ; her opponent in that final , Kim Clijsters ; and the 2001 and 2002 champion , Jennifer Capriati . <p> All three were once ranked No. 1 , and all three were forced to skip the first Grand Slam event of 2005 because of significant injuries . <p> The men have hardly been spared the litany of pain . Of those who have reached No. 1 since 1998 , five have had major injuries : Marcelo Rios , Carlos Moya , Marat Safin , Patrick Rafter and Gustavo Kuerten . <p> In the past three years , such forced layoffs have been as much a part of the game as grunts and ground strokes , disrupting emerging rivalries along with overwrought tournament directors ' sleep patterns . <p> The most obvious explanation is the lack of a true off-season and the increasing depth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks caused by modern , trunk-twisting technique . Some players and trainers say the trend toward slower surfaces and balls in men 's tennis , along with stiffer , polyester strings , have also been detrimental . <p> " It 's a brutal game now , " said Wayne Ferreira of South Africa , who retired from the Tour last year . " Guys have become stronger ; the points are lasting longer . You 're having to run a lot more , and the rallies take a lot more out of you . " <p> Two other top women 's players , Serena Williams and Lindsay Davenport , have had major knee surgery , with Davenport missing most of 2002 and Williams missing eight months in 2003 and 2004 . <p> " It 's a shame , but it does seem like we all end up taking our turn getting hurt , " Davenport said . " The women 's game could be going through this amazing period , but we have n't been healthy at the same time . " <p> In the men 's game , Rios and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman , a former French Open finalist from Sweden who reached No. 2 but was never able to recover fully from a hip condition . <p> It is a similar condition to the one that has forced Kuerten , the elastic , charismatic Brazilian , to have two hip operations . <p> Other former top-five players who have missed several months or more of play the past few years include Guillermo Coria and David Nalbandian of Argentina ; Tommy Haas of Germany ; Greg Rusedski of Britain ; and Mark Philippoussis of Australia . <p> The sport at the professional level has , until now , not done a complete job of studying and cataloging injuries . There are no studies of the number of injuries in the professional ranks 10 years ago . <p> " But it does appear that more professionals are disabled , " said Dr. Ben Kibler , the medical director of the Lexington Clinic Sports Medicine Center in Kentucky and a leading authority on tennis injuries and biomechanics . " At a participatory level , in terms of people who are serious players but not professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 to 15 years ago . " <p> Officials with the WTA maintain that the rate of injuries is not increasing in the women 's game . Henin-Hardenne , the world 's No. 1 player in 2003 , missed much of last season because of a virus , not an injury , although she did miss the Australian Open with a knee injury . <p> " I think what we 've seen is a cycle , " said Kathleen Stroia , the Tour 's vice president for sports science and medicine . " It 's some of the top players right now who 've had injuries , so it 's in the forefront in the media . <p> " What we are seeing are different types of injury . " <p> Stroia , who joined the WTA Tour 16 years ago as a trainer , said that chronic conditions , like knee tendinitis , were rarer now but that " episodic injuries , " like leg strains and wrist sprains , were on the rise . <p> Relatively new techniques  --  the open-stance forehand ; the semi-open-stance two-handed backhand ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The biomechanics have changed , and when that happens , the training has to change , " said Dr. Brian Hainline , chief medical officer of the United States Open . " For the training to change , sports science has to determine what 's happening . The problem is that this lags behind . <p> " The game has gone in such a way that it has placed a much greater demand on what we call the core stability , and that has to do with the lower extremities , the buttock , the hip , the abdomen . If you compare the forehand or even the backhand of now to 10 or 15 years ago , there is such an incredible acceleration and rotation that occurs at the hip and trunk level . " <p> Core training has been in vogue in professional sports for the last decade , and the overwhelming consensus in tennis medical circles is that it is essential to survival in the modern game . " Core stability is a major issue , " Kibler said . " If you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or leg or groin . " <p> According to Kibler , a 1989 survey of young amateur tennis players from age 16 to 20 found that the most common injuries were to the shoulder and back , " but that groin and wrist injuries are really coming up . " <p> Kibler said groin injuries were on the rise because players were being jerked around the court more violently by the pace of the game . When yanked wide , they are now trying to hit full-force shots from more extended , vulnerable positions instead of settling for the defensive slices or lobs of previous generations . <p> " These rackets they use today , you can go to the moon with them , " said Guillermo Vilas , the former French Open and United States Open champion from Argentina . " You can do anything you want with them . You have so many choices , but the whole body has more chance of getting injured because every shot is possible from every position . " <p> Players are also taking bigger cuts at the ball because they feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally slower , a move made by tournament organizers to increase the length and entertainment value of rallies . The players ' desire for control while they swing away helps explain the rise in popularity of polyester string . <p> " It 's changed the way the game is played , " Dean Goldfine , who coaches Andy Roddick , said . " There 's not as much point construction , and more of these guys are learning from the time when they 're young to go out and swing as hard as they can on every single ball . That 's not good for the body . " <p> Bobby Reynolds , an American who reached the third round at the Australian Open , said he began experiencing numbness in his right pinkie and index fingers after using polyester string during his junior year at Vanderbilt , when he was the nation 's top-ranked collegiate player . After he started having only half his racket strung with polyester , he said the numbness dissipated . But he was displeased with his results and resumed using all polyester in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball down in the court , " he said . " I 'd rather try to win and not feel my fingers than not feel I was giving it my best shot . " <p> Kibler said existing scientific data did not support the theory that the string was the culprit . " Strings weigh so little , and the difference in the dwell time of the ball on the strings is very small , " he said . " As far as we can tell , the weight of the racket and stiffness of the racket has much more to do with vibration than the stiffness of string , types of string or tensions of string . " <p> Tennis players have long run the risk of suffering for imperfect technique . " If you do an open-stance forehand correctly , the arm moves rapidly along , and you can flick your wrist easily , because the whole trunk and body are moving , " Kibler said . " But if you get out of sync and do n't have good core stability , you end up using the wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the modern two-handed backhand , whose practitioners , including Clijsters and Safin , have had major wrist injuries on their left , or nondominant , arms . " The reason for this is the new style , " Kibler said . " Look at Jimmy Connors 's or Chris Evert 's two-handers . It was a one-handed backhand with the other arm going along and helping to stabilize . " <p> But for all the biomechanical peril , doctors , coaches , players and some administrators continue to reserve the bulk of the blame for the length of the season . The 2005 men 's season began with three low-level tournaments on Jan. 3 and will not end until the last day of the Davis Cup final on Dec. 4 . The 2005 women 's season will end three weeks earlier , on Nov. 14 , with the WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles . <p> " Personally , I think they need three months minimum ; look at other sports , " Hainline said . <p> For now , Larry Scott , the chief executive of the women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps by 2007 . The men 's tour , with its denser tournament schedule and four-week obligation to Davis Cup , will have more difficulty , although the Australian Open 's decision to start one week later , beginning in 2007 , will create slightly more room to maneuver . <p> Hainline added a word of caution . " In some ways the players are in much better shape , " he said . " That , I know for a fact . But the demands are so much greater .
