Red lights flashed like fire in the murky shadows of the night . Mattie Evans slid from the seat of her truck and made her way to the accident scene , tuned to the shrill , intermittent static of the emergency radios . <p> What a way to start this early Sunday morning , not even a week into the new year . Lord , give me strength . <p> As she neared , the crushed sedan came into view . A ghostly chill crept up her spine . She noted the shattered glass , a trail of blood . Paramedics worked to pull the driver from the car and transferred the motionless boy to a stretcher . <p> At the sight of the victim 's marred face , Mattie pressed her hand to her mouth . Another body lay covered on the ground . <p> " Thanks for getting here so quickly , Doc . " The county sheriff met her on the dirt road , and Mattie forced herself to regain control . " Got ourselves a bad one . Two drunk teens hit a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... well , it do n't look good . As for the horse , I doubt you can save him . " <p> With his flashlight , he cleared a path through the dense fog , and Mattie followed to the edge of the road where her patient lay . Blood stained the gravel . <p> " They probably did n't even see the animal until it was too late , " he said . " Do n't know why the horse was on the road-must have a fence down . " He shined a beam into the dark pasture . " Likely spooked and jumped toward the vehicle , then smashed into the windshield . Still breathing , though . " <p> Mattie knelt for a closer inspection . Someone had tried to stop the massive bleeding with towels , to no avail . She stroked the horse 's neck , and the gelding raised his head . The white of his eye showed pure terror , dilated from shock . <p> " He 's lost a lot of blood . " The sheriff drew the light over the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached into her bag for a syringe . Once she had the horse sedated , she removed the towels to examine him . Her heart sank at the extent of the damage . <p> The impact of the windshield had lacerated his right shoulder , withers , and limb . Corneal rupture of the right eye and massive skull fractures . A quick check of his mouth revealed his old age . She noted the paleness of his gums . <p> At times like this , she hated her job . Such hopelessness . Angered by the senseless destruction , she fought back tears , her teeth clenched as the horse lay wheezing his every breath . Despite her oath to save animals , Mattie knew the horse would require extensive treatments , and even then , his chances for a full recovery were slim . <p> " He 's in a lot of pain . " The nagging worry from her recent loss caused her to doubt her abilities . " There 's no reason to make him suffer . I recommend putting him down . " <p> " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered close by . <p> Her gaze jolted to see her friend John McCray slumped over his cane . " Did n't you just get out of the hospital ? You should n't be out on a night like this . " <p> " That 's my fault . " Another man stepped from the darkness , and Mattie acknowledged John 's hired hand , Jake . " When I heard the car horn blaring and realized what had happened , I called the ambulance . Figured the boss would want to be here . " <p> " This is Gil 's horse . " John gripped her shoulder . " You have to save him . " <p> Mattie had heard stories about Gilbert McCray from her older sisters , though John hardly spoke of his son . Some said he could have been a professional team roper , but he 'd left it all to become a football hero in California . A stupid move , as far as she was concerned . Why would anyone give up being a cowboy for a football career ? <p> She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . " She studied the horse 's wounds again , then glanced up at John McCray . Mattie recognized the look of regret , the kind that left people empty . She also acknowledged the uncomfortable tightening in her stomach . If she tried to save the horse and he died , could her business or her heart handle another fatality ? <p> * * * <p> The team manager for the San Francisco 49ers opened the door to the trainer 's room , and the musty stench of sweat crept in and mingled with the odor of medicine and bandages . " Gil , your dad 's calling on your cell . I figured you 'd want to take it . " His booming voice broke through the racket of the locker room next door as he tossed the phone to Gil . <p> Gilbert McCray slid off the table and apologized to the attendant taping his ankle . He checked the caller ID and could n't imagine why his dad would be calling just hours before a playoff game-unless it was an emergency . <p> He flipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? " <p> A raspy cough sounded on the other end . " I have some bad news for you , Son . " <p> Gil stepped into the hallway for better reception . " Is everything okay ? " <p> " It 's Dusty , " his dad said . " He was in an accident early this morning . I hated to call you , but they 're not sure if he 's going to make it . I thought you should know . " <p> Gil frowned at the mention of his chestnut gelding . " What happened ? " <p> " He was hit by a car . Got through the fence and must have been on the edge of the road . Too foggy . The driver did n't see him . " <p> Dusty . Gil swallowed the emotion threatening to clog his throat as the memories whooshed back . He and the horse had been a team . Gil trained Dusty from a colt , learned some great techniques on his back , and won plenty of high school championships with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridden the horse for two years , the news caught him off guard . <p> " Is he in much pain ? If we need to , I 'll hire the best vet in the country . Fly him in . " The familiar catch in his voice reminded him of his boyhood when he 'd asked for simple favors , believing his dad could do anything . <p> " We 've already got the best , Son . I just thought you should be prepared . " <p> After he said good-bye , Gil slammed his fist against the wall . A burning sensation shot through his shoulder to his palm . He 'd give anything to see Dusty one last time . Unfortunately , two hours from now , he had a date with destiny , an appointment at Lambeau Field . If his team won the Division Championship against the Green Bay Packers , they 'd be one game closer to the Super Bowl . If they lost , this would be the last game of Gil 's career . Funny , he was about to retire from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retiring from the game of life . <p> * * * <p> Gil waited on the sideline while the defense played the field . In all his years as quarterback , he 'd never experienced the chaotic feelings tumbling over him this first half . Two decades ago , he 'd left everything for the game of football . Rodeo . His dad . With no regrets . Or maybe he 'd never allowed himself that luxury until now . <p> He stared out at the field and watched as one of their linebackers intercepted Green Bay 's pass . <p> Offense 's turn . <p> The lights glared down as Gil blocked the roar of the spectators from his mind . Silence . His offensive line crowded around , waiting for his call . <p> " Go on two . " His breath turned into a puff of vapor in the brisk night air . Gil walked to the line of scrimmage , adrenaline pumping . <p> " Down , set , hut , hut ... " <p> The ball snapped into his hand . He dropped from the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The defense had his running backs blocked as well . <p> No clear path-either throw or run . <p> No time for debate . <p> He tucked the pigskin into his arm and faked a sweep , rolling over the first lineman coming his way . His legs careened him up and over the defense as they 'd done a hundred times before , and he flew down the field like a horse after a steer let out of the chute . A cornerback charged him from the side . Gil slid to the ground . <p> " First down , " the referee called out . <p> Gil saw the official 's signal and should have been thrilled . Instead , he stole a glance at the hostile Packer crowd and caught sight of a man who looked like his father . His breath stilled . <p> Impossible . His dad did n't attend his games . He did n't care enough to . <p> " Do you even see what 's happening out here ? " Johnson jammed his fists into Gil 's padded shoulders . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gil stared up at the lights . <p> Concentrate . Keep your mind in the game . <p> He went to set up another formation and listened for the radio signal in his helmet . Receiving his coach 's instructions , Gil pitched his hands into the huddle , felt the determination of his teammates as the heat rose off their bodies . He refused to let them down . " This time we 'll go for a 40/50 sprint draw . On one . " <p> He moved into position behind his center . <p> " Red , blue , 40-50 , set hut . " <p> The ball swept up into his hands . Gil sensed a blitz and passed to his wide receiver . Missed . Incomplete . <p> He tried again . This time when Gil got the ball , he maneuvered it to feel the roughened leather of the seam and pedaled back . He snaked to the left to hand off to Johnson , his halfback . The ball barely left his hand when three defensive linemen dropped him to the ground . <p> Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
