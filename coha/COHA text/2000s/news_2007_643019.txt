<p> IF tax season makes you feel like David facing Goliath , remember that David won and that today 's tax software gives you an accurate slingshot with plenty of stones . What is more , you need relatively little knowledge of either taxes or computers in order to use it . <p> But you do need patience to answer all the interview questions that the software poses , and you need accurate financial records : the W-2 forms provided by employers , the 1099 forms that payers of dividends , interest and other income send out and receipts and your own records to support any deductions you may claim . <p> Of course , you need all these records in order to have your return prepared professionally , too . <p> Either way - doing it yourself with software or going to a pro - a look at a completed Form 1040 can help with tax preparation and the year-round financial planning that can help limit the tax bite . So , Jan M. Rosen of The New York Times used the TurboTax program , published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at TurboTax , to prepare this sample return for a hypothetical New York suburban couple . <p> Like several million other taxpayers , the couple are liable for the alternative minimum tax . That tax was originally intended to trap very rich taxpayers who were escaping regular taxation , but in recent years it has snared middle-class taxpayers as well , especially in New York , New Jersey , Connecticut and California - not because of tax shelters or sophisticated strategies , but often because of high state income taxes and high local property taxes . <p> An expanded version of the tax return and commentary is at **32;38;TOOLONG Out the 1040 <p> Form 1040 is a summary of income , adjustments to income , deductions and credits . Many of those amounts are bottom-line figures copied from a return 's other forms and schedules . Taxable income and the tax due on it are calculated on Page 2 . Tax software or an online preparation program asks users clear questions in an on-screen interview . Then the program puts the answers on the right forms and does the calculations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Do n't fudge or guess at a number for a W-2 or 1099 that has gone missing . Employers , banks , brokers and others who paid you must send copies of W-2 and 1099 forms to the Internal Revenue Service , as well as to you . The I.R.S. computers compare what the payers report with what taxpayers report on their returns . <p> TurboTax can download W-2 and 1099 forms from many employers and financial institutions , automating data entry . <p> Like most married couples , this hypothetical couple  --  Samuel P. and Felicity Q. Taxpayer  --  are filing jointly ( Line 2 ) . They claim four exemptions ( Line 6 )  --  two for themselves and one each for their son , Cyril , 17 , and daughter , Heidi , 13 . <p> The couple have several sources of income . Samuel is employed full time and Felicity part time . The $127,000 shown on Line 7 of the 1040 is the total of their salaries from Box 1 of their W-2 's , excluding $17,000 that they put into tax-deferred 401(k) retirement plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line 8a and tax-exempt interest of $265 on Line 8b . Ordinary dividends of $1,408 on Line 9a include qualified dividends of $1,197 ( Line 9b ) , as reported on Form 1099-DIVs issued by financial institutions . Qualified dividends , which include most dividends from stocks , are taxed at 15 percent , or at 5 percent for people in the 10 percent and 15 percent brackets . <p> Felicity , a graphic designer , also has a home-based business , from which she received income of $31,308 , after expenses . That is calculated on Schedule C and listed on Line 12 . Capital gains of $1,996 ( Line 13 ) come from Schedule D. <p> Although the Taxpayers ' total income is $162,298 ( Line 22 ) , four adjustments bring their adjusted gross income down to $144,267 ( Line 37 ) . The first , on Line 27 , is $2,212 , which is one-half of Felicity 's self-employment tax from Schedule SE for her freelance business . The $5,819 on Line 28 is her contribution to a Keogh retirement plan for self-employed people . On Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first wife , whose Social Security number must be shown ( Line 31b ) . <p> The fourth adjustment is $2,000 on Line 35 for Cyril 's tuition at Cornell ; that amount is the maximum deduction allowed for their income . The typed " T " on the line indicates that it is a tuition deduction . Congress extended four expired tax breaks in December . The I.R.S. had already printed forms without them , so it issued a series of codes to put on other lines when claiming them . <p> After itemized deductions of $30,073 ( Line 40 , from Schedule A ) and four personal exemptions worth $13,200 ( Line 42 ) , the couple 's taxable income is $100,994 ( Line 43 ) . In addition to regular tax of $18,112 ( Line 44 ) , they are liable for alternative minimum tax of $842 ( Line 45 , from Form 6251 ) , bringing their total income tax to $18,954 ( Line 46 ) . <p> Next come credits , which offset taxes dollar for dollar . The Taxpayers claim $28 ( Line 47 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $90 energy credit ( Line 52 , from Form 5695 ) for a new energy-efficient back door , as well as $60 for a one-time credit representing a refund of previously collected federal telephone excise taxes ( Line 71 ) . <p> Felicity 's self-employment tax of $4,424 ( Line 58 , from Schedule SE ) brings their total tax to $23,260 ( Line 63 ) . After withholding from salaries of $19,000 ( Line 64 ) and estimated tax payments of $3,600 ( Line 65 ) , they owe $600 ( Line 76 ) . Schedule A : Itemized Deductions <p> Medical expenses ( Line 4 ) can be deducted only to the extent that unreimbursed outlays exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income . Like most other Americans , the Taxpayers do not qualify . <p> The couple report state and local income taxes of $9,314 ( Line 5 ) , real estate taxes of $12,992 ( Line 6 ) and home mortgage interest of $5,939 ( Line 10 ) . Because Felicity uses a home office for her freelance business , the mortgage interest and real estate taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Form 8829 and are deducted against her business income . <p> They also deduct gifts to charity of $1,828 ( Line 18 ) . Those gifts include $200 ( Line 16 ) for the thrift-shop value of used clothing and toys donated to a church rummage sale . Effective Aug. 17 , 2006 , any such donations must be in good condition or better to be deductible . <p> Like most filers , the couple could not take a miscellaneous itemized deduction ( Line 26 ) for costs like union dues , unreimbursed employee business expenses and tax preparation . It is allowed only for expenses that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income ( $2,885 on Line 25 ) . <p> Their itemized deductions total $30,073 ( Line 28 ) . Form 6251 : Alternative Minimum Tax - Individuals <p> The alternative minimum tax goes back to 1969 when Congress , trying to close loopholes that were allowing the rich to escape taxation , created a separate tax system with lower rates but far fewer breaks than the regular system . <p> Because tax cuts in recent years have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxpayers are liable . Some 3.8 million are expected to owe it for 2006 . Without a one-year patch enacted last summer raising the income that is exempt from the A.M.T. , the projected number would have been 19 million , and the Urban Institute predicts that 23 million will be liable this year if Congress does not change the law again . <p> The A.M.T. denies personal exemptions and certain other breaks  --  notably the deduction for state and local taxes , snaring many people in high-tax states like New York and California . <p> Income of $114,194 ( Line 1 ) , from Line 41 of the 1040 , is adjusted gross income minus itemized deductions from Schedule A. State and local taxes of $22,306 ( Line 3 ) bring A.M.T. taxable income to $136,519 ( Line 28 ) and are the main reason for an A.M.T. liability of $842 ( Line 35 ) . Schedule D : Capital Gains And Losses <p> Asset sales last year that resulted in a capital gain or loss are reported on Schedule D. This couple 's return includes only mutual fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be used to report sales of real estate , artwork and other assets , and even of municipal bonds . ( Only the interest on these bonds , not any profit on sales , is tax-exempt . ) Active traders must file Schedule D-1 , a continuation sheet for Schedule D , to report all their sales . <p> The cost in column " e " includes brokerage fees and charges , and the sale price in column " d " is calculated after deducting such fees . Assets held for a year or less are considered short term , and sales are reported in Part I ; such gains are taxed like ordinary income . Long-term gains and losses  --  those on assets held more than a year  --  are listed in Part II . Longterm gains on stocks and stockbased mutual funds are taxed at 15 percent , or , for lower-income taxpayers , at 5 percent . The total gain or loss for each asset sold is listed in column " f . " <p> The couple sold 100 shares of Blockbuster stock they had held for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain of $670 ( Line 7 ) . In Part II , they list the sales of five long-term stock holdings ( Line 8 ) . They sold them to help pay Cyril 's college costs . They had long planned to give the shares to him to sell at his lower tax rate . But because Congress last year raised the age limit to 18 from 14 on what is known as the kiddie tax , they sold the shares themselves . ( As a result of that change , the unearned  --  generally , that means investment  --  income above $1,700 for children under 18 is now taxable at the parents ' rate , not the child 's . ) Cyril is 17 and had dividend and interest income approaching the $1,700 limit . Even so , the capital gains tax will be low because of a big loss on JDS Uniphase stock that was acquired in the giddy dotcom days . It nearly offset gains on Devon Energy , Perry Ellis , Harley-Davidson and Home Depot . In addition , they had a capital gains distribution of $12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks it owned . The stock sales and fund distribution resulted in a net longterm capital gain of $1,326 ( Line 15 ) . <p> In Part III of Schedule D , the short-term and long-term gains total $1,996 ( Line 16 at the top of Page 2 ) . It is carried forward to Line 13 of the 1040 . <p> Keeping track of the data for Schedule D can be demanding for active traders and for others who have bought blocks of the same security at different times or have stocks or mutual funds on which dividends have been reinvested . When mutual fund shares are sold , those reinvested dividends become part of the cost basis  --  taxpayers who list only the purchase price and subtract it from the sales price will be overstating any resulting gain and thus paying too much tax.Schedule C : Profit or Loss From Business <p> Felicity Taxpayer , who has self-employment income from her unincorporated freelance business as a graphic designer , must file Schedule C for a sole proprietorship . <p> She reported gross receipts of $40,000 ( Line 7 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenses , detailed in Part II , were $450 for advertising ( Line 8 ) , $482 for business use of her personal car ( Line 9 ) and $1,800 ( Line 13 ) for a specialized drafting table and lighting equipment . Rather than depreciate these items over several years , she chose to deduct the entire cost under Section 179 , an option known as expensing . Section 179 may be used for purchases of up to $108,000 to the extent that there is offsetting income . Felicity also deducted $2,705 for business use of her home ( Line 30 , from Form 8829 ) . <p> In case of an I.R.S. audit  --  and returns that include Schedule C have above-average audit rates  --  business owners must substantiate their deductions . That means they need to keep meticulous records , file all receipts , keep a log of car mileage and write notes about who was entertained , where and the business purpose . <p> After expenses , Felicity reported a net profit of $31,308 ( Line 31 ) . Schedule SE : Self-Employment Tax <p> Self-employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 15.3 percent , they represent both the employer 's and employee 's shares of Social Security and Medicare taxes . They are calculated on Schedule SE , based on the net profit of the business . <p> For Felicity , the profit as reported on Schedule C is $31,308 ( Line 2 ) . The tax on that amount is $4,424 ( Line 5 ) . <p> Because businesses can deduct the Social Security and Medicare taxes that they pay for employees , self-employed people can deduct half of their self-employment tax ( Form 1040 , Line 27 ) . <p> Employed people who also have sideline businesses or do freelance work owe no Social Security tax for 2006 on their second income if the maximum Social Security tax was withheld from their wages or salaries . That would mean they had employment income of $94,200 or more . But they still owe Medicare tax of 2.9 percent. ##
