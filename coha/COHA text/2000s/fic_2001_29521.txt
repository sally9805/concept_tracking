The house on Lookout Mountain Road was set far in from the street and nestled against the steep canyon embankment to the rear . This afforded it a long and flat green lawn running from the wide front porch to the white picket fence that ran along the street line . It was unusual in Laurel Canyon to have such an immense lawn , front or back , and one so flat as well . It was that lawn that would be the key selling point of the property . The open house had been advertised in the real estate section of the Times as starting at two p.m. and lasting until five . Cassie Black pulled to the curb ten minutes before the starting time and saw no cars in the driveway and no indication of any activity in the house . The white Volvo station wagon she knew belonged to the owners that was usually parked outside was gone . She could n't tell about the other car , the black BMW , because the little single-car garage at the side of the house was closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owners of the home were out for the day and would not be present during the showing . This was fine . Cassie preferred they not be home . She was n't sure how she would act if the family was right there in the house as she walked through it . Cassie remained in the Boxster until two p.m. and then grew concerned , her mind jumping to the conclusion that she had gotten the time wrong or , worse yet , the house had already been sold and the showing canceled . She opened the real estate section on the passenger seat and checked the listing again . She had been correct . She looked at the for sale sign posted in the front lawn and checked the broker 's nameagainst the name in the advertisement . They matched . She got her cell phone out of her backpack and tried to call the realty office but could n't get a connection . This did n't surprise her . She was in Laurel Canyon and it always seemed impossible to get a clear cell transmission in any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and control her fears , she studied the house that stood behind the for sale sign . According to the advertisement , it was a California Craftsman bungalow built in 1931 . Unlike the newer homes on either side , it was not only set back off the street into the hillside rising behind it , but it also seemed to possess a good deal of character . It was smaller than most of the neighboring homes , its designers obviously putting a premium on the large lawn and the openness of the property . The newer houses in the neighborhood had been built to every lot line , under the philosophy that interior space was premium . The old bungalow had a long , sloping gray roof from which sprouted two dormer windows . Cassie assumed that one belonged to the bedroom shared by the couple and the other was the girl 's room . The sidings were painted a reddish brown . A wide porch ran the length of the front of the house and the front door was a single-light French door . Most days the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but today the blinds over the door and the front picture window were up and Cassie could see into the living room . An overhead light had been left on . The front yard was definitely the play area . It was always neatly cut and trimmed . Built along the left perimeter was a wooden swing set and jungle gym . Cassie knew that the girl who lived in the house preferred to swing with her back to the house and facing the street . She had often thought about this , wondering if there was something about this habit that could be read as some sort of psychological clue . The empty swing hung perfectly still . Cassie saw a kick ball and a red wagon sitting motionless in the grass , also waiting for the attention of the girl . Cassie thought the play area might be one of the reasons the family was moving . All things being relative in Los Angeles , Laurel Canyon was a pocket of reasonable safety in the sprawling city . Still , it was n't desirable in any neighborhood to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , the place where harm could befall them , where danger could come to them . It did n't say anything about this potential problem with the yard in the advertisement . Cassie looked down and read it again . BRING ALL OFFERS ! 1931 Classic Calif . Craftsman 2/2 , spacious living/dining , huge wooded lot . Highly motivated and anxious ! Reduced and priced to sell ! Cassie had noticed the for sale sign on the property during a routine drive-by three weeks earlier . The sighting had thrown her life into turmoil , which was manifested in insomnia and inattention at work . She had not sold a single car in the three weeks , her longest absence ever from the sales tote board . Today 's showing was the first open house as far as she knew . So the wording of the ad struck her as curious . She wondered why the owners would be so anxious to sell that they would already have reduced the price after only three weeks on the market . That did not seem right . Three minutes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassie did n't recognize , a maroon Volvo sedan , pulled into the driveway and stopped . A slim , blond woman in her mid forties got out . She was casually but neatly dressed . She opened the trunk of her car and removed an open house sign , which she carried toward the curb . Cassie checked her hair in the visor mirror , reached to the back of her head and pulled the wig down tight on her scalp . She got out of the Porsche and approached the woman as she set up the sign . " Are you Laura LeValley ? " Cassie asked , reading the name off the bottom of the for sale sign . " I sure am . Are you here to look at the house ? " " Yes , I 'd like to . " " Well , let me open it up and we 'll go from there . Nice car you 've got there . Brand new ? " She pointed to the dealer blank in the front license plate holder of the Porsche . Cassie had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving to the open house . It was just a precaution . She was n't sure if brokers took down plate numbers as a means of tracing leads or backgrounding potential buyers . She did n't want to be traced . It was the same reason she was wearing the wig . " Uh , yes , " she said . " New to me but used . It 's a year old . " " Nice . " The Boxster looked pristine from the outside but was actually a repo with almost thirty thousand miles on it , a convertible top that leaked and a CD player that habitually skipped when the car hit the slightest bump in the road . Cassie 's boss , Ray Morales , was letting her use it while he dealt with the owner , allowing the guy until the end of the month to come up with the money before putting the car onto the lot . Cassie expected that they would never see a dime from the guy . He was a deadbeat through and through . She 'd looked at the package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time , and then skated on the next six . Ray had made the mistake of taking the guy 's paper after he 'd gotten no takers from the outside loan companies . That was the tip-off right there . But the guy had talked Ray into taking the paper and turning over the keys . It really bugged Ray that he had been beaten . He 'd personally gone out on the rig when they hooked up the Boxster outside the deadbeat 's hillside box overlooking Sunset Plaza . The real estate woman went back to her car and removed a briefcase , then led Cassie up the stone walkway to the front porch . " Are the owners going to be home ? " Cassie asked . " No , it 's better when no one 's home . Then people can look where they want , say what they want . No hurt feelings . You know , people 's tastes are different . One person will think something is gorgeous . Somebody else will call it hideous . " Cassie smiled to be polite . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white envelope from her briefcase and took out a key . As she opened the door she continued the patter . " Are you being represented by a broker ? " " No . I 'm just kind of in the looking stage at the moment . " " Well , it helps to know what 's on the market . Are you currently in ownership ? " " Excuse me ? " " Do you own now ? Are you selling ? " " Oh . No , I rent . I 'm looking to buy . Something small like this . " " Children ? " " Just me . " LeValley opened the door and called out a hello just to make sure no one was home . When there was no answer , she waved Cassie in first . " Then this should be perfect . It 's just two bedrooms but the living spaces are large and very open . I think it 's just darling . You 'll see . " They walked into the house and LeValley put her briefcase down . She then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palty , " Cassie lied as she shook the broker 's hand . LeValley gave a quick description of the attributes and assets of the house . From her briefcase she took out a stack of printed fliers containing information on the house and gave Cassie one as she talked . Cassie nodded occasionally but was barely listening . Instead she was intensely scrutinizing the furnishings and the other belongings of the family who lived in the house . She stole long glances at the photos on the walls and on tables and chests . LeValley told her to go ahead and browse while she set up the sign-in sheet and information packets on the dining room table . The house was very neatly kept and Cassie wondered how much of that was due to the fact that it was being shown to potential buyers . She moved into a short hallway and then up the stairs that led to two bedrooms and bathroom above . She stepped a few feet into the master bedroom and looked around . The room had a large bay window that looked out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LeValley called from below , seemingly knowing exactly what Cassie was looking at and thinking . " Mudslides are not a problem . The hillside out there is extruded granite . It 's probably been there for ten thousand years and , believe me , it 's not going anywhere . But if you are seriously interested in the property , I would suggest you get a geological survey done . If you buy it , it will help you sleep better at night . " " Good idea , " Cassie called down . Cassie had seen enough . She stepped out of the room and crossed the hall to the child 's bedroom . This room , too , was neat but cluttered with collections of stuffed animals , Barbie dolls and other toys . There was a drawing easel in one corner holding a crayon drawing of a school bus with several stick figures in the window . The bus had pulled up to a building where a red truck was parked in a garage . A firehouse . The girl was a good artist . Cassie checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then stepped over to the easel . She flipped over some of the pages containing prior drawings . One drawing depicted a house with a large green lawn in front of it . There was a for sale sign at the front of the house and a stick figure of a girl stood next to it . A bubble coming from the girl 's mouth said Boo Hoo . Cassie studied it for a long time before breaking away and looking around the rest of the room . On the left wall there was a framed movie poster for an animated film called The Little Mermaid . There were also large wooden letters spelling the name JODIE SHAW , each letter painted a different color of the rainbow . Cassie stood in the middle of the room and silently tried to take it all in and commit it to memory . Her eyes fell on a photo which stood in a small frame on the girl 's white bureau . It showed a smiling girl standing with Mickey Mouse amidst a crowd at Disneyland . " Their daughter 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She turned . Laura LeValley stood in the doorway . Cassie had not heard her on the steps . She wondered if the broker had been suspicious of her and intentionally sneaked up the stairs to catch her stealing or doing something else . " Cute kid , " LeValley said , giving off no sign of suspicion . " I met her when I first took the listing . I think she 's six or seven . " " Five . Almost six . " " Excuse me ? " Cassie quickly pointed to the photo on the bureau . " I would guess . I mean , if that photo 's recent . " She turned and raised a hand , taking in the whole of the room . " I also have a niece who is five . This could be her room . " She waited but there were no further questions from LeValley . It had been a bad slip and Cassie knew she was lucky to have gotten away with it . " Well , " LeValley said , " I want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . Are there any questions I can answer for you ? I even have an offer sheet with me if by any chance you 're ready to do that . " She smiled as she said the last line . Cassie smiled back . " Not just yet , " she said . " But I do like the house . " LeValley headed back to the stairs and down . Cassie moved toward the door to follow . As she stepped into the hallway , she glanced back at the collection of stuffed animals on a shelf above the bed . The girl seemed partial to stuffed dogs . Her eyes then went back to the drawing on the easel . Down in the living room LeValley handed her a clipboard with a sign-in sheet on it . She wrote the name Karen Palty , the name belonging to an old friend from her days dealing blackjack , then made up a phone number with a Hollywood exchange and an address on Nichols Canyon Road . After she handed it back LeValley read the entry . " Karen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking for , there are several others in the canyon I 'd be more than happy to show you . " " Okay , that would be fine . Let me think about this one first , though . " " Oh , sure . You just let me know . Here 's my card . " LeValley offered a business card and Cassie took it . She noticed through the living room 's picture window a car pulling to the curb behind the Boxster . Another potential buyer . She decided it was time to ask questions while she still had LeValley alone . " The ad in the paper said the Shaws were anxious to sell the house . Do you mind me asking how come ? I mean , is there something wrong here ? " Halfway through her question Cassie realized she had used the name of the owners . Then she remembered the letters on the wall of the girl 's room and knew she was covered if LeValley noticed the slip . " Oh , no , it has nothing to do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been transferred and they are anxious to make the move and get settled in their new place . If they sell it quickly they can all move together , rather than him having to commute back and forth from the new location . It 's a very long trip . " Cassie felt she needed to sit down but stood still . She felt a terrible dread engulf her heart . She tried to remain steady by placing her hand on the stone hearth but was sure she was not hiding the impact of the words she had just heard . It 's a very long trip . " Are you okay ? " LeValley asked . " Fine . I 'm fine . I had the flu last week and . . . you know . " " I know . I had it a few weeks ago . It was awful . " Cassie turned her face and acted as though she were studying the brickwork of the fireplace . " How far are they moving ? " she asked , as casually as was possible considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited , sure that LeValley knew by now she was n't here because of the house . " Paris . He works for some kind of clothing import business and they want him working on that end of things for a while . They thought about keeping the house , maybe renting it out . But I think realistically they know that they probably wo n't be coming back . I mean , it 's Paris . Who would n't want to live there ? " Cassie opened her eyes and nodded . " Paris . . . " LeValley continued in an almost conspiring tone . " That 's also the reason they would be very interested in any kind of an offer . His company will cover him on anything below appraisal value . Anything within reason . So a quick , low bid might really be able to turn this . They want to get over there so they can get the girl into one of those language schools this summer . So she can start learning the language and be fairly integrated by the time school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch . She stared into the darkness of the hearth . A thousand fires had burned there and warmed this house . But at the moment the bricks were black and cold . And Cassie felt as though she were staring at the inside of her own heart . In that moment she knew that all things in her life were changing . For the longest time she had lived day to day , carefully avoiding even a glance at the desperate plan that floated out on the horizon like a dream . But now she knew that it was time to go to the horizon .
