Chapter One Many stories begin with a simple lesson learned , and our family 's story is no exception . For brevity 's sake , I 'll summarize . In the beginning , we children were conceived . And the lesson learned-at least according to my Catholic mother- goes like this : " Always remember , " she told me , " that no matter what the church tells you , the rhythm method does n't work . " I looked up at her , twelve years old at the time . " You mean to say that we were all accidents ? " " Yep . Each and every one of you . " " But good accidents , right ? " She smiled . " The very best kind . " Still , after hearing this story , I was n't sure quite what to think . On one hand , it was obvious that my mom did n't regret having us . On the other hand , it was n't good for my ego to think of myself as an accident , or to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one too many glasses of champagne . Still , it did serve to clear things up for me , for I 'd always wondered why our parents had n't waited before having children . They certainly were n't ready for us , but then , I 'm not exactly sure they 'd been ready for marriage either . Both my parents were born in 1942 , and with World War II in its early stages , both my grandfathers served in the military . My paternal grandfather was a career officer ; my dad , Patrick Michael Sparks , spent his childhood moving from one military base to the next , and growing up largely in the care of his mother . He was the oldest of five siblings , highly intelligent , and attended boarding school in England before his acceptance at Creighton University in Omaha , Nebraska . It was there that he met my mom , Jill Emma Marie Thoene . Like my dad , my mom was the oldest child in her family . She had three younger brothers and sisters , and was mostly raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her father was an entrepreneur who ran a number of different businesses in the course of his life . When my mom was a teenager , he owned a movie theater in Lyons , a tiny town of a few hundred people nestled just off the highway in the midst of farmland . According to my mom , the theater was part of the reason she 'd attended boarding school as well . Supposedly , she 'd been sent away because she 'd been caught kissing a boy , though when I asked about it , my grandmother adamantly denied it . " Your mother always was a storyteller , " my grandmother informed me . " She used to make up the darnedest things , just to get a reaction from you kids . " " So why did you ship her off to boarding school ? " " Because of all the murders , " my grandmother said . " Lots of young girls were getting killed in Lyons back then . " I see . Anyway , after boarding school , my mother headed off to Creighton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the similarities between my parents ' lives that first sparked their interest in each other . Whatever the reason , they began dating as sophomores , and gradually fell in love . They courted for a little more than a year , and were both twenty-one when they married on August 31 , 1963 , prior to the beginning of their senior year in college . A few months later , the rhythm method failed and my mom learned the first of her three lessons . Micah was born on December 1 , 1964 . By spring , she was pregnant again , and I followed on December 31 , 1965 . By the following spring , she was pregnant with my sister , Dana , and decided that from that point on , she would take birth control matters into her own hands . After graduation , my dad chose to pursue a master 's degree in business at the University of Minnesota and the family moved near Watertown in the autumn of 1966 . My sister , Dana , was born , like me , on December 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father went to school during the day and tended bar at night . Because my parents could n't afford much in the way of rent , we lived miles from town in an old farmhouse that my mother swore was haunted . Years later , she told me that she used to see and hear things late at night-crying , laughing , and whispered conversations-but as soon as she would get up to check on us , the noises would fade away . A likelier explanation was that she was hallucinating . Not because she was crazy-my mom was probably the most stable person I 've ever known-but because she must have spent those first few years in a foggy world of utter exhaustion . And I do n't mean the kind of exhaustion easily remedied by a couple of days of sleeping in late . I mean the kind of unending physical , mental , and emotional exhaustion that makes a person look like they 've been swirled around in circles by their earlobes for hours before being plunked down at the kitchen table in front of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age twenty-five , with three babies in cloth diapers-with the exception of those times when her mother came to visit-she was completely isolated for the next two years . There was no family nearby to lend support , we were poor as dirt , and we lived in the middle of nowhere . Nor could my mom so much as venture into the nearest town , for my father took the car with him to both school and work . Throw in a couple of Minnesota winters where snow literally reached the roof , subtract my always busy dad from the equation , throw in the unending whining and crying of babies and toddlers , and even then I 'm not sure it 's possible to imagine how miserable she must have been . Nor was my father much help-at that point in his life , he simply could n't . I 've often wondered why he did n't get a regular job , but he did n't , and it was all he could do to work and study and attend his classes . He would leave first thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . So with the exception of three little kids , my mother had absolutely no one to talk to . She must have gone days or even weeks without having a single adult conversation . Because he was the oldest , my mom saddled Micah with responsibilities far beyond his years-certainly with more responsibility than I 'd ever trust my kids with . My mom was notorious for drumming old-fashioned , midwestern values into our heads and my brother 's command soon became , " It 's your job to take care of your brother and sister , no matter what . " Even at three , he did . He helped feed me and my sister , bathed us , entertained us , watched us as we toddled around the yard . There are pictures in our family albums of Micah rocking my sister to sleep while feeding her a bottle , despite the fact that he was n't all that much bigger than she was . I 've come to understand that it was good for him , because a person has to learn a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because you suddenly need it . But I think that because Micah was frequently treated as an adult , he actually believed he was an adult , and that certain rights were owed him . I suppose that 's what led to an almost adult sense of stubborn entitlement long before he started school . My earliest memory , in fact , is about my brother . I was two and a half-Micah a year older-on a late-summer weekend , and the grass was about a foot high . My dad was getting ready to mow the lawn and had pulled the lawn mower out from the shed . Now Micah loved the lawn mower , and I vaguely remember my brother pleading with my father to let him mow the lawn , despite the fact that he was n't even strong enough to push it . My dad said no , of course , but my brother-all thirty pounds of him-could n't see the logic of the situation . Nor , he told me later , was he going to put up with such nonsense . In his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , I know what you 're thinking . He 's three and a half years old-how far could he go ? My oldest son , Miles , used to threaten to run away at that age , too , and my wife and I responded thus : " Go ahead . Just make sure you do n't go any farther than the corner . " Miles , being the gentle and fearful child that he was , would indeed go no farther than the corner , where my wife and I would watch him from the kitchen window . Not my brother . No , his thinking went like this : " I 'm going to run far away , and since I 'm always supposed to take care of my brother and sister , then I guess I have to take them with me . " So he did . He loaded my eighteen-month-old sister in the wagon , took my hand , and sneaking behind the hedges so my parents could n't see us , began leading us to town . Town , by the way , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was to cross a busy two-lane highway . We nearly made it , too . I remember marching through fields with weeds nearly as tall as I was , watching butterflies explode into the summer sky . We kept going for what seemed like forever before finally reaching the highway . There we stood on the shoulder of the road-three children under four , mind you , and one in diapers-buffeted by powerful gusts of wind as eighteen-wheelers and cars rushed past us at sixty miles an hour , no more than a couple of feet away . I remember my brother telling me , " You have to run fast when I tell you , " and the sounds of honking horns and screeching tires after he screamed " Run ! " while I toddled across the road , trying to keep up with him . After that , things are a little sketchy . I remember getting tired and hungry , and finally crawling into the wagon with my sister , while my brother dragged us along like Balto , the lead husky , pushing through Alaskan snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was fun , this was an adventure . And despite everything , I felt safe . Micah would take care of me , and my command from my mother had always been , " Do what your brother tells you . " Even then , I did as I was told . Unlike my brother , I would grow up doing what I was told . Sometime later , I remember heading over a bridge and up a hill ; once we reached the top , we could see the town in the valley below . Years later , I understood that we must have been gone for hours-little legs can only cover two miles so fast-and I vaguely remember my brother promising us some ice cream to eat . Just then , we heard shouting , and as I looked over my shoulder , I saw my mother , frantically rushing up the road behind us . She was screaming at us to STOP ! while wildly waving a flyswatter over her head . That 's what she used to punish us , by the way . The fly-swatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most frequent recipient of the flyswatter punishment . My mom liked it because even though it stung , it did n't really hurt , and it made a loud noise when connecting with the diaper or through pants . The sound was what really got to you-it 's like the popping of a balloon- and to this day , I still feel a strange sort of retributive glee when I swat insects in my home . It was n't long after the first time Micah ran away that he did it again . For whatever reason , he got in trouble , and this time it was my dad who went for the flyswatter . By then , Micah had grown tired of this particular punishment , so when he saw my father reaching for it , he said firmly , " You 're not going to swat me with it . " My dad turned , flyswatter in hand , and that 's when Micah took off . Sitting in the living room , I watched as my four-year-old brother raced from the kitchen , flew by me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard the thumping upstairs as my brother performed various , unknown acrobatics in the bedroom , and a moment later , he was zipping back down the stairs , past me again , through the kitchen and blasting through the back door , moving faster than I 'd ever seen him move . My dad , huffing and puffing-he was a lifelong smoker-rumbled down the stairs , and followed him . I did n't see either of them again for hours . After it was dark , when I was already in bed , I looked up to see my mom leading Micah into our room . My mom tucked him in bed and kissed him on the cheek . Despite the darkness , I could see he was filthy ; smeared with dirt , he looked like he 'd spent the past few hours underground . As soon as she left , I asked Micah what happened . " I told him he was n't going to swat me , " he said . " Did he ? " " No . He could n't catch me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking , I knew you 'd make it . Continues ...
