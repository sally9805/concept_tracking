An L.A. family shows how to downsize with imagination // Jennifer Cheh 's former home looked like a dream house . It was huge-about 9,000 square feet-and was located in an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood . " Needless to say , that 's a lot of house to take care of . It was a burden , " she says . " We lived there for years and never furnished all the rooms . " Around the time Jennifer 's husband , Patrick , launched a second movie-production business , the couple decided to simplify . They sold the big house and moved with their two boys , Nicholas , 9 , and Adrian , 7 , into a 1,300-square-foot 1920s cottage . Although it sounds like a recipe for disaster , it proved to be a great move . " We scaled down so much , we had to prioritize and let a lot of stuff go . It was a cleansing experience , " Jennifer says . Designing for a new life In addition to being small , the house was dark and storage-challenged . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her training as an architect , something she had n't done since becoming a full-time mom . " At first , it was daunting , " she says . " I knew I had to make the most of every inch , and I wanted to make it feel more spacious by letting in natural light . " Photograph With fewer rooms to maintain and easy access to the rear yard , home can be more relaxing for Jennifer and Patrick Cheh and their two sons . // She did that by opening up interior walls along the central hall and replacing the drywall ( not the studs ) with panels of a ribbed translucent plastic material called Lexan Thermoclear Sheet ( manufactured by GE Advanced Materials , and usually available through your contractor ) . " Now light comes in through the bedroom windows right into the core of the house . It 's much brighter , " Jennifer says . She used a similar technique in the master suite : A translucent sliding glass door efficiently separates the bedroom and bathroom while allowing each space to borrow light from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new deck along the rear of the house . The next step involved rethinking the hallway . Originally it was just a passage ; now it 's also a storage/work center . " We widened the hallway to 57 inches , taking space from the kitchen , " says Jennifer . " This allowed us to install a long desktop for die family computer and bookshelves for our books and photos . " Photograph Clockwise from top : Part of the hallway becomes a study ; walls are translucent so rooms can borrow light from each other ; a new rear deck runs almost the width of the house . // Storage space was at a premium . Jennifer created mini storage walls in each bedroom using white kitchen cabinets from Ikea ( www.ikea.comfor store locations ) . Tb save floor space , she used upper cabinets , which are only 12 inches deep , as floor cabinets , which are usually 24 inches deep . Patrick based his new business in the backyard garage , which the family converted to office space . Jennifer turned one of its exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of it with chalkboard paint for the boys to draw on . Smaller is better " Having a big house , we thought we needed more and bigger things . There was no end to it , " Patrick says . " We are much happier in this house . " Jennifer concurs : " Because we do n't have to spend hours on household chores , we have much more time for the kids .

Here 's what she learned . * Give Qway duplicates . " We had doubles and even triples of things ' says Jennifer . " That 's the easiest decision : Keep only one . " * Make downsizing a way of life . " With the kids , we started early , " says Jennifer . " We put out an empty box and asked them to put in the toys they did n't play with anymore . " * Work with the scale of your home . The family was looking for maximum storage , but big pieces made the rooms in the new house seem small . Jennifer opted for long , low storage items to make the most of the space . * Save items that have sentimental value . " Sometimes it 's not a question of needing , it 's a matter of wanting , " Jennifer says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // <p>
