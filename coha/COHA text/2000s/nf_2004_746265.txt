In the United States alone , the teen market accounts for $27 billion in consumption expenditure per year ( Moses 2000 ) . Not surprisingly , corporate America is aware of the size and importance of the youth market , and as teens begin to make major purchasing decisions for the first time in their lives , corporations vie for their dollars , looking for current sales and lifelong consumer loyalty . In recent years , large corporations have discovered new channels into the youth market , such as teen-focused retail outlets , promotional booths at rock concerts , internet advertisement , and product-related Web sites ( Music 2000 ) . In addition , established companies , such as Pepsi , have focused on creating new products and repositioning existing products toward the young buyer ( New/Redirected Products 2000 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make independent buying decisions , I believe that it is important to arm them with the tools necessary to respond to the marketing barrage and to navigate the financial waters that lie ahead . Unfortunately , most teens will not receive that education in public school . In a 1998 National Council on Economic Education ( NCEE ) survey , researchers found that only twenty-eight states required the implementation of an economics standard in their curriculum , and only sixteen states required students to take an economics course in high school . Because of the lack of resources dedicated to economic education , I do not find it surprising that the NCEE found that " most American adults and students flunk a basic economic test " ( NCEE 1999 ) . With only a modest improvement in the statistics in the most recent NCEE survey ( thirty-four states currently require the implementation of an economics standard and seventeen require an economics course in high school ) , the NCEE continues to identify economic literacy as an important educational priority for Americans , particularly students ( NCEE 2003 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle school level , there are practical hurdles to making that goal a reality . Academic economists , who are well trained in economic theory and its applications , are not trained , generally , in the theory and application of effective curriculum development and teaching methods for the middle school classroom . Primary and secondary school teachers , who have training and experience in developing and delivering curriculum , rarely have a background in economics . That creates a divide that academic economists and middle school educators must bridge so that they can better serve teens who are beginning to make a lifetime of economic decisions . <p> In this article , I contribute to the bridge-building by presenting four activities that teach basic economic concepts and consumer decision making through active problem solving . My goal in designing the curriculum is to address some National Council on Economic Education content standards ( NCEE 2003 ) through a student-centered , problem-solving approach . I require students to wrestle with economic decisions , and I equip them with some of the knowledge and tools that they need to make good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used this set of activities with middle school students in the introductory portion of a three-week , problem-based course called Everyday Economics . I also report classroom outcomes , describing how students responded to the activities . Although the activities , outcomes , and assessment methods described here are targeted at middle schoolers , I have found that the activities work equally well in a college classroom and provide some similar outcomes . <p> The activities are an effective means by which teachers can cover national social studies standards . Economics fulfills the National Council for the Social Studies curriculum standard that social studies programs " should include experiences that provide for the study of how people organize for the production , distribution , and consumption of goods and services " ( NCSS 1994 ) . Teachers can use the activities as part of a stand-alone consumer economics unit or by integrating the activities into an existing social studies curriculum . Not only do the activities meet one or more of the NCSS curriculum standards , they also can be incorporated into an existing curriculum because the activities do not require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the student . To aid teachers in achieving the NCSS goals , each unit contains an assessment activity and ideas for integrating the material into the social studies curriculum . <p> The effectiveness of the curriculum lies in its student-centered , problem-solving approach . The rationale for applying an interactive approach is twofold . First , students in the middle school age group are just beginning to engage in abstract thinking ; therefore , it is necessary to involve them in concrete activities and to challenge them to solve specific problems before discussing the more abstract economic concepts behind the problems . Second , the world economy is dynamic . The major economic issues that individuals , nations , and the global community face today are dramatically different from what they were even ten years ago . The problem-solving approach introduces students to well-established economic concepts and arms them with a set of analytical skills that can be applied to new economic situations in the future . <p> The curriculum is broken into three major units , with a total of four activities . The three subject areas are basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each unit builds on the previous one but contains its own curricular goals and activities . Each can be completed in a class period or , with additional activities , can be expanded to include other areas of the school curriculum . The first unit introduces students to the purpose of a market and requires them to make decisions about the method by which an economy decides how goods are distributed among its members . The second unit focuses on the individual 's consumption decisions , and it requires the students to uncover how individual consumer preferences translate into demand for a good and how corporations attempt to affect consumption decisions through advertising . The third unit requires students to buy and sell in a market that they create , thus highlighting issues of consumer and producer choice . <p> In each unit , I identify the learning objectives and offer activity methods , an assessment activity , and ideas for integrating the unit into an existing social studies curriculum . I describe some classroom outcomes from using the activities in the middle school classroom . It is my hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students are already thinking about economic issues and that the article will inspire them to take the first step toward incorporating economic education into their classrooms . Conclusion <p> Economic education is something that no child can afford to live without . On one hand , middle school students are economically savvy . It is particularly striking that many have already formed a rational basis for economic decision making . They are familiar with the concept of demand and the way that producers attempt to manipulate their demand for a good through advertising . When asked to produce and sell a good to their own classmates , they fell back on that behavior themselves . <p> Although savvy at heart , teenagers readily admit the importance of the status and image of some of the goods that they buy and for which , in many cases , they are willing to pay . In the activities involving active problem solving , students examine their own decision-making criteria . The exercises give them a new way of viewing their consumption choices so that they will be able to make better , more-informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
