July , 1976 <p> The swamp bustled with the sounds of a summer morning . Mosquitoes buzzed in the shade , mockingbirds trilled from the pecan trees and in the distance , an outboard motor chugged toward the oyster beds and the shallow fishing waters of the Atchafalaya Basin . <p> But the house was quiet . <p> Too quiet , Nella Prather thought uneasily as she walked up the gravel driveway . <p> Something black and sinewy slithered through the grass , and she gave it a wide berth as she headed across the yard to the porch . <p> Slowly she climbed the steps and knocked on the screen door . When she did n't get an answer , she cupped her hands to the sides of her face and peered inside . <p> The interior was so dark she could n't see anything beyond the shadowy front hallway , nor could she hear so much as a whisper from any of the children . <p> That 's strange . <p> Her cousin 's five offspring ranged in ages from eight years all the way down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes , they looked like perfect little angels . <p> But even angelic children made some racket . <p> Despite the silence , the family had to be home . It was still early , and Mary Alice 's old station wagon was parked under the carport . They lived too far out in the country to walk to town or even to the nearest neighbor . <p> Besides , Mary Alice rarely left the house . She 'd converted the back sunporch to a classroom so that she could homeschool the two older children , Ruth and Rebecca . If they were out there now , she might n't have heard the knock , Nella decided . <p> But she hesitated to call out in case the boys  --  Joseph , Matthew and baby Jacob  --  were still sleeping . <p> Turning , she glanced out over the bayou , where the lily pads were bursting with purple blooms . The air smelled of mimosa , moss and the wet green lichen that grew on the bark of the cypress trees lining the banks . <p> It was beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension fluttered in Nella 's heart . <p> Where are the children ? <p> Except for an overturned tricycle in the dense shade of a cedar tree and a tiny , forgotten sneaker at the top of the steps , the place looked immaculate . Baskets of ferns hung from the porch rafters , and the lawn was painted with patches of red and yellow four-o'clocks and pink peonies . <p> Nella could n't imagine how her cousin managed to keep everything so orderly , especially now that her husband had left her . According to Nella 's mother , he 'd just up and walked out months ago , leaving Mary Alice to fend for herself and the children . <p> Thank goodness she had a small inheritance from her father to fall back on , but that would n't last long , what with feeding and clothing five little ones . Nella worried how her cousin would cope once the money ran out . <p> I should have come sooner . She 's my own flesh and blood , and I could n't be bothered to drive out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Alice had n't been close in years , not since the summer Nella had come home from her first year at LSU to find her cousin engaged to Charles Lemay , a dark , taciturn man fifteen years her senior . <p> Charles was extremely handsome , Nella would give him that . And she supposed there were some who might even consider him charming . But the way he 'd flattered and cajoled and later browbeat a besotted Mary Alice had disgusted Nella . <p> And then the babies had started coming , some barely a year apart . Throughout her pregnancies , even the difficult ones , Mary Alice had worked like a dog caring for the house and children and making sure her husband was properly pampered . <p> Charles had put the family on a rigid schedule  --  dinner on the table by six and bedtime at eight , except on nights when they all attended church service together . <p> His church , naturally . <p> Mary Alice had been raised Catholic , but Charles would never allow his wife and children to drive all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , where she 'd received First Communion . Instead , they 'd joined a rural , nondenominational congregation that met in an abandoned gas station near the highway . <p> Nella had never gone to one of the prayer meetings , but she 'd heard talk of snake-handling . Rumor had it one of the members had nearly died the year before when he 'd been bitten by a pit viper . <p> A chill wind swept over Nella , an early breeze from the storm clouds gathering out in the gulf . Or so she thought . <p> But then she realized that the Spanish moss in the live oaks was completely still , the porch so silent she could hear the drone of a fly trapped on the inside of the screen door . <p> The cold breath that blew down her back was n't the wind , she realized . It was dread . <p> She pulled open the screen door , no longer concerned with whether or not she woke the boys . Something was wrong . She could feel it . <p> " Hello ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut behind her . " Mary Alice ? " <p> Nella 's flip-flops slapped against the old hardwood floor as she walked down the long hallway , glancing first in the parlor , then hurrying through the dining room to the kitchen . <p> She stood for a moment , gazing around in wonder . The room was pristine . Not a speck of dust or a crumb to be found anywhere . <p> But there was another fly in the window and , mindful of the loathsome insect , Nella placed the basket of food she 'd brought on the table and made sure it was covered before she walked out back to the enclosed porch . <p> Here , the chalkboard was blank , the textbooks and lesson plans neatly stacked in the shelves . Nothing was out of place . No reason to think anything was amiss . <p> And yet Nella 's trepidation deepened as she retraced her steps to the front of the house . Something drew her attention to the cramped room beneath the stairs . The door was closed , but she 'd heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spine as she placed a hand on the knob . The door opened quietly and for a moment , Nella saw nothing inside . <p> Then , as the door swung wider , a shaft of sunlight fell across a child sitting cross-legged on the floor . <p> Head bowed , light haloing her golden hair , she cradled a doll in her arms as she rocked back and forth . <p> Mary Alice 's daughters were only a year apart , and they looked so much alike that it was hard to tell one from the other . <p> " Ruth ? " Nella said softly . <p> No answer . <p> " Rebecca ? " <p> Only silence . <p> " Where 's your mama ? " <p> The little girl looked up then , her blue eyes eerily serene . <p> Slowly , she lifted a finger to her lips . " Shush . She 'll hear you . " <p> The hair at the back of Nella 's neck lifted as she leaned down . She 'd meant to offer comfort to the child , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nella recoiled in shock . <p> It was n't a doll , she realized in horror , but a newborn baby bundled in a towel and still bloody from the birth canal . <p> She heard a thud against the floor upstairs and she whirled , more terrified than she 'd ever been in her life . Something was so very wrong in this house . <p> " I 'll be right back , " Nella whispered to the child . " You stay put , okay ? " <p> Heart hammering , she closed the door and started up the stairs . <p> Mary Alice 's bedroom was right off the landing . The door was open , and as Nella reached the top of the stairs , she saw a bloody handprint on the wall outside the bedroom and a trail of wet footprints on the hardwood floor . <p> But Mary Alice was nowhere to be seen . <p> Nor were the other children . <p> Trying to fight off a wave of panic , Nella followed the tracks to a room down the hallway . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . She could n't tell what it was at first , and then comprehension struck her so hard she staggered back , fist pressed to her mouth . <p> Her stomach churned as she stared in horror at the shadow of a noose swinging back and forth against a sunny yellow wall . <p> Out of the corner of her eye , she saw someone at the end of the hallway and she spun . <p> One of the little girls stood in front of the window , and the sunlight spilling in made her seem nebulous and golden , like a ghost child . <p> Without a sound , the girl started toward Nella . <p> " Are you okay ? " Nella called softly , trying not to frighten the child . <p> When the girl did n't answer , Nella said a little more urgently , " Where 's your mother ? " <p> The child wore a blue dress with a matching hair ribbon . She looked angelic and sweet and it was only when she drew closer that Nella saw the bloodstains all down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you hurt ? " <p> The little girl shook her head . " Jacob got it on me when he grabbed my dress . " <p> " Is Jacob hurt ? " <p> " No , he does n't hurt . Not anymore . " <p> Her soft voice was melodic , a tinkling bell , but the shock of her words stole Nella 's breath . " What do you mean ? " <p> The girl 's movements were so lethargic she seemed under a hypnotic spell . She stared up at Nella with the same eerie calm as her sister . " Jacob was bad . They were all bad . Mama said they had the evil in them just like my daddy . It was n't their fault , but they had to be saved just the same . " <p> Nella drew a ragged breath , trying desperately not to let the horror of the moment overwhelm her . " Where are they ? " <p> " Shush . " The child put a tiny finger to her lips , mimicking her sister . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " The evil . Ca n't you feel it ? " <p> Nella 's heart flailed like a trapped bird inside her chest as she stole a glance over her shoulder . Somewhere down that long hallway , a floorboard creaked . <p> Had someone come up behind her ? The other girl ? <p> For a moment , Nella could have sworn she saw something hovering at the top of the stairs . A giant shadow that was there one moment , gone the next . <p> The child 's gaze was transfixed , as if she could see something that Nella could not . <p> It was all Nella could do not to snatch the child up and run screaming from the house . Something terrible lurked in those shadowy rooms , in the beguiling depths of that little girl 's wide blue eyes . <p> She bent and put her hands on the child 's arms . " Where are your brothers ? You have to tell me so that I can help them . " <p> The little girl 's gaze strayed to the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried them down to the swamp . " <p> Oh , dear God . " Can you take me to them ? " <p> " I have to find my sissy first . " <p> She reached for Nella 's hand . Her tiny fingers were warm , but the fear that slid down Nella 's spine was ice cold . <p> Together they descended the steps , and Nella opened the door beneath the staircase . <p> The other girl was gone , but the baby lay wriggling on the floor . Nella reached for the tiny body . <p> I have to get them out of here . Lord , please help me save them . <p> But when she glanced over her shoulder , the hallway behind her was empty . <p> Ruth and Rebecca Lemay had vanished . <p> Present day <p> There is no odor in the world like that of rotting human flesh , Detective Evangeline Theroux thought as she climbed out of the car . <p> The scent hung heavy on the hot , sticky air , an insidious perfume that stole her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to stifle her gag reflex . <p> A group of uniformed officers stood in the overgrown front yard of the deserted house and Evangeline could feel their eyes on her . It was like they could smell her weakness and were anticipating with relish a mortifying display . <p> Jerks . <p> As if she would ever give them the satisfaction . <p> A female police detective was n't much of an anomaly these days , but there were those in the New Orleans PD who still clung to their good-ol ' - boy mentality . Evangeline was accustomed to hostile scrutiny from some of her male colleagues , and she knew better than to give them any unnecessary ammunition . <p> Turning away from those condescending glances , she swallowed hard , though she pretended to survey her surroundings  --  a ghost street in the Lower Ninth Ward . A no-man's-land of abandoned vehicles and tumbledown houses that served as an enclave for the city 's crack merchants and the homeless . <p> This was the section of New Orleans hit hardest by the floodwaters , and it was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some referred to it as the " bad " side of the Industrial Canal because of the crime rate . Others called it Cutthroat City . <p> Her late husband , Johnny , had once called it home . <p> Evangeline mopped her brow as she waited for Mitchell Hebert to get out of the car . The swampy heat was not helping her queasy stomach . Earlier , clouds had drifted in from the gulf , bringing a cool breeze and a quick shower , but now the purplish banks had given way to a robin's-egg-blue sky . At ten-thirty on a June morning , the temperature was already in the high nineties and the steam rising from the drying puddles felt like a sauna . <p> " You smell that ? " Mitchell asked as he climbed out of the car . " That 's dead-body smell . " <br> Continues ...
