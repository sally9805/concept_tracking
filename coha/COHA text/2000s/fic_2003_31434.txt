The Song Reader It started when we tried to find our father , once , a long time ago . Mom had just died and we were reeling from the loss of our normal life . Tracking him down was my idea , although I thought it was the obvious thing to do under the circumstances . My sister did n't agree . At Mom 's funeral , when people asked if we were going to contact our father now , she stared right through them . Later she said she could n't believe such a rude question . How could it matter after this ? How could anything matter after this ? Mom had been on her way home from the July sale at Venture department store when she pulled out in front of an eighteen wheeler on Highway 61 . Her car was cut in two , but when the insurance adjuster pried open the trunk , the bag from the sale was still intact . A green and pink striped bath towel , two packages of girls ' size 10 underwear for me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know anything about Debby Harry or punk , but she 'd always called Mary Beth her " blondie . " What I remember about that time is how tired I was . I would go to bed so sleepy that I felt like I 'd be out for hours , only to startle awake and realize again what had happened . Mary Beth had the same problem , but when the doctor at the hospital had offered her sleeping pills , she 'd said no . " Doctors try to cure everything with pills , " she told me , " even feelings . " I would have gladly taken them but nobody offered . I was just a kid . We waited weeks to clean out Mom 's bedroom . We bagged up the clothes first , to give to the needy . It was what Mom would have wanted . Mary Beth was almost six-feet-tall ; Mom had been five-three at best , and I had no immediate plans to wear polyester pants suits and stiff-collared shirt-dresses . Dad had been gone five years by then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . There was no after-shave stain on the dresser , no tie collecting dust in the bottom of the closet , no flattened , laceless wing tip under the bed . It was just luck that I found his ring under Mom 's cedar chest-luck in the form of an old vacuum cleaner that balked and spit the silver circle back at my ankle hard enough to make me bend down and take a look . It took me a minute to realize that the ring must have been Dad 's . It was engraved with his initials , HN , Henry Norris , but it was so small it fit me . I found out later that he 'd worn it as a little boy , a gift from his mother . Dad adored his mother . This was one of the few facts I had about him . He grew up in Tennessee . His father died when he fell off a train , drunk , when Dad was seven . His mother had to support them with her sewing , " piece-work " they called it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clothing , getting nothing if she was too sick or tired to turn in anything at the end of a day . But when Dad was seventeen , she too died suddenly . She had a stroke of some kind , quite rare for as young as she was , and I 'd heard whispers between cousins I barely knew about Dad 's reaction : how he had a kind of nervous-breakdown and great-aunt somebody had to take him to her house to recover , and how after that he , the **44;853;TOOLONG - of- himself boy you ever saw , never even finished high school . Mary Beth told me once it takes guts to go nuts , and he must have had guts . " Most people , " she said , " ignore the wound , put a Band-Aid on it , and forget it . Only the gutsy ones can look right at the blood , stare into the pain , and risk losing their minds to know what 's what . " I did n't think she was talking about Dad though . She almost never did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would tell me something about him . I 'd had a dream he was standing on a boat wearing a skipper 's cap , holding a compass , issuing directions to unseen sailors . Later I realized I 'd seen a picture of him on a boat , taken when he and Mom were on their honeymoon at the Lake of the Ozarks , but this did n't shake my feeling that he had crossed the sea and was thousands of miles from Tainer , Missouri . When Mary Beth saw the ring on my finger , she said , " How cute , " as though I was a little kid playing dress-up , as though this ring was as meaningless to me as the ones that shot out in colorful plastic orbs from the gumball machine . She knew I did n't really remember Dad . I was five when he left us ; she was seventeen . One of the only discussions we 'd ever had about him was when she realized I was making up things , telling my friends whatever came to mind , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a job in Hollywood , behind the camera for Eight is Enough . I think she felt sorry for me , because she gave me two true stories instead . When he worked for Hedley 's Auto Parts and Tires , she said , he made a jungle gym out of junk parts and old tires that had a 10 foot tall hide-out that was the favorite of all the kids in the neighborhood . And once , he won a contest at the civic club downtown . It was like Name That Tune and he could name them faster than anyone . He always loved music , especially shows like Oklahoma and Carousel and classical stuff . Neither of these things helped . The jungle gym had nothing to do with me ; I 'd never even seen it . ( We 'd moved into our apartment on the second floor of Agnes ' house when I was just a baby ; Mary Beth said the gym would have been impossible to move even if we 'd had the yard space . ) And the contest business was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't share . She was the musical one , the one who 'd had the largest record collection in the senior class . Maybe I wanted to know something about him that she did n't . Maybe that 's why I started writing to his relatives to locate him , without mentioning what I was doing to her or anyone . Mom had kept some of their addresses in her blue phone book . I began with the N page , for Norris , and just kept going , writing one a day , every afternoon , before Mary Beth came home from her waitress job . I knew it was a long shot , but Mom always said hard work would pay off in the long run . And it turned out to be true . After a few months of writing , I got the information I was waiting for . Joseph Morgan , from Kansas City , a second cousin of Dad 's whom I 'd met only once long ago at a family reunion in Boonville , had seen Dad . His letter went on for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of , but it ended with the news that Dad had given him an address . No phone , not even an unlisted one , but a street and an apartment number and even a zip code . I folded the letter carefully and stuck it in my dresser , under my pajamas . I intended to keep it a secret from Mary Beth for at least a few days , but I barely lasted through dinner . She did n't speak for a full minute after reading the letter . I thought for sure she was upset , but then she smiled . " You did it , honey . Good for you . " It crossed my mind that she 'd known all along I 'd been trying to find him , but I was too happy to care . When I told her I was going to write him that night , she nodded . " Of course you are . " It was n't a long letter . I told him we were doing fine , that I was in the fifth grade and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him about Mom . I almost did n't , figuring it would come as such a shock , but I worried that if I did n't , he might not write back . I signed my letter , " All my love . Your daughter , Leeann . " I circled the date I mailed the letter on the calendar , Tuesday , December 5 , and calculated how long I would have to wait for a response . I figured for sure I would hear something by the fifteenth , but when the fifteenth came and went , I decided he had n't written because he was going to just show up for the holidays and surprise us . I wished I 'd asked him what he wanted for Christ as . I had to get him something , but I did n't know what he liked or his size or even his favorite color . I settled on a one-size-fits-all acrylic sweater from The Men 's Place in bright blue and violet stripes . My favorite color was blue , Mary Beth 's was violet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a little . Mary Beth knew I was buying Dad a present and she did n't try to talk me out of it . " It 's sweet of you . If he does n't come here for Christmas , we can always mail it to him . But what 's really important is what you want for Christmas . You have n't told me yet , you know . " She sighed . " I want to make this holiday as normal as possible . I think it 's what Mom would want for us . " I did n't really care about presents , but I made a short list . On Christmas morning , it was all there : a pair of jeans , a Sony portable radio , and a set of fancy drawing pencils . But Dad did n't come . Of course . His sweater , wrapped in green and yellow snowmen , stayed under the tree in the back , almost out of sight , until New Year 's Day when Mary Beth and I packed up the ornaments and put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed the present under my bed , where it was safe , and where I would n't have to see it everyday . I stopped thinking about Dad . I knew I 'd have to keep trying , but I did n't know where to begin . But about a month and a half later , I came up with a plan . I would go to Kansas City to deliver the sweater myself . This time when I told my sister there was no smile . She was watching One Day at a Time and filing her nails . She said it was n't a good idea , and turned up the volume on the TV . " Come on , Mary Beth , " I said . " I 'm sure we could get there in a few hours . It 's not that far . " " It takes about five hours , but that 's not the problem . " Her voice was flat ; she was concentrating on the edge of her thumb . " Think about it . He knows exactly where we are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has to be a reason for that . " When I pressured her to tell me what that reason could be , she shook her head . " I 'm not up to discussing this right now . Please , Leeann , just leave it alone . " But I could n't do that . Every night that week after she got home from work , I begged her to change her mind , and every night , she told me to drop the subject . I tried everything , from promises of good behavior to persuading her latest boyfriend , Nick , to take my side . Nothing helped . My promises were sweet , she said , but they did n't change the situation . And Nick 's advice was meaningless . What would he know about her family and her life ? He was n't the first guy to hear that from my sister , and he was n't the first ( or last ) to be dumped when he tried to interfere . She told him not to call anymore after she found out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Sunday when she had to work . I felt bad for him , but I had to tell her . I knew it would be just the thing to make her realize she had no choice in the matter . I did n't want to go with Nick ; I wanted to go with her . And it worked . She said we could leave in a few weeks , as soon as she could arrange a weekend off . I hugged her and thanked her . I said it would be an adventure , a real life long-lost-loved-one kind of meeting like the ones in the movies . " Maybe , " was all she said . When the Friday evening finally arrived , I packed up the present and my nicest skirt and knitted beige sweater while Mary Beth threw together some of her stuff . The drive took almost exactly five hours , and I was so tired when she pulled into a Travel Lodge motel in Independence that I fell asleep immediately , with my clothes still on , when I lay down on the stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bearings in Kansas City and find the downtown area , and then go south , like the map Mary Beth bought at the motel told us to do . When we finally got close to Dad 's , however , Mary Beth decided we could n't go yet since we had n't had lunch , so we headed further south , to the Plaza . I complained a little but I really did n't mind . Just seeing his neighborhood had made my throat go dry and itchy . We ate , and hung out at the Plaza , looking in store windows , trying on clothes we could n't afford . Finally , Mary Beth said we better get going , and we headed back up to Harrison Street . We found the address quickly . It was a three story , dark-red-brick apartment building , run-down looking , with an overflowing dumpster on the side , and two yellowing plastic chairs sitting on the front lawn . We opened the door , and I swallowed hard when I saw Henry Norris printed neatly on a white card above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buzzer . No one answered so she rang again . Still no answer , so she rang the buzzer on the left , underneath the card that said Landlord . A woman in a purple housecoat and silver-sequined slippers opened the door . She looked us over without any expression . " Who 're you looking for ? " Mary Beth said , " Henry Norris . I see his name here , but he does n't answer his buzzer . Do you have any idea when he might return ? We 're sorry to bother you , but we 've come a long way , and we ca n't wait too long . " " I wish I knew . He let out of here two weeks ago without so much as a goodbye . He did n't owe me no back rent , but he left the place in an awful state . My nephew came over last week and took one look and told me he 'd have to give it at least two coats of paint before I can advertise . In the meantime , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet as it is . So I 'm not real happy with Henry Norris right now . Are you related ? " " Yes , " Mary Beth said . " We 're his daughters . " She looked us up and down again , but she did n't say anything . I figured she was waiting for us to go , but I was n't about to do that . This was as close as I 'd come to him for five years . " I want to see the apartment , " I said quickly . The landlady shrugged , but Mary Beth shook her head . " Come on , " I said , grabbing my sister 's arm . " Maybe there 's a new address or something . It 'll only take a minute . Please . We ca n't just leave without trying . " " Okay , okay . " She turned to the landlady . " If it 's not too much trouble . " The woman shrugged again . " Maybe you can figure something out from the mess he left behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaking stairs . " It 's up here , " the landlady said , pulling a ring of keys from her housecoat pocket . " Be careful , " she added , looking at me . " This place ai n't no playground . " She opened the door . " I 'll be downstairs . Let me know when you 've finished so I can lock up . " It was a one-room apartment . Over on the left was the living room area , with a small green couch , an old TV with bent-rabbit-ears antenna , and a wobbly , wood-veneer coffee table . The kitchen area was in the back corner , with a plastic-top-table and two metal chairs with sticky-brown-rubber cushions . The bedroom area was by the window and was the smallest of all , just a three-drawer dresser and a twin bed that came out of a closet . The landlady was right , it was a mess , but I hardly noticed the trash even though a couple of times I had to kick away crumpled paper and old cans . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reeked of spoiled food . It was the walls I noticed . They were covered with words , filled with big square letters . Someone-it took me a minute to realize it must have been Dad-had actually written on almost every available inch of the walls with a thick black pen . On the wall behind the couch , he 'd written EVERY MORNING in large print , and then underneath a list numbered from one to fifteen . Many of the words we e smeared and illegible , but I made out : Brush Teeth Wash Face Bowl of Cereal Juice Coffee Bus #9 leaves from corner at 7:42 Pack lunch FIRST ! Get three quarters from drawer for bus there , three quarters more for bus home : total of six quarters needed . Coat ! KEYS ! ! ! Lock apartment door Lists like this covered every wall in the place . There was a list for every evening over by the pullout bed , with instructions like " eat dinner , " " lock the door , " " wash out underwear for the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week : Tuesday 's list , in the bathroom , included taking the trash to the dumpster outside ; Saturday 's longer list , by the kitchen table , included going to the Laundromat and the corner grocery store . There was another list right by the refrigerator of things to buy at the store ( which seemed senseless to me until I decided he must have copied this one down on paper before he went to do his shopping ) . There were even reminders for specific days over by the door , such as " December 17th : Library Books Due . Library Closes at exactly 7:30 , " and " November 8th , 10:30 A.M. , plant physical . Shower in morning first . " There were so many words , so many lists , and I moved from wall to wall like a spider , taking it all in . I could n't stop reading , even though my mind was becoming numb and my eyes were aching from the strain of trying to read as the room grew shadowy in the early dusk of February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , something that would explain the why of all these words . Only after more than an hour , when I 'd seen all the walls and read every legible word , did I finally fall back , bone-tired , on the couch by Mary Beth . Her eyes were closed , and her head was lying back , but I knew she was n't asleep because her teeth were pressed down , biting her bottom lip . I told her I was ready , and she stood up without saying anything and walked downstairs . The landlady was cooking spaghetti when we knocked on the door . The garlic smell was so heavy it made me feel a little sick to my stomach . When she opened the door , she asked us if we 'd found what we were looking for and Mary Beth nodded . Then Mary Beth opened her purse and pulled out two twenty dollar bills . " It 's not much , but it 'll help pay for the paint at least . I 'm really sorry about your trouble , and thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman smiled warmly for the first time . " That 's awfully good of you . It 's just too bad you did n't catch him . Hold on . I 've got something for the little girl . " She brought out a bruised apple and put it in my hand . " You 're probably hungry by now . You all take care of yourselves . If I see Henry Norris again , I 'll be sure and tell him you were here . " Lisa Tucker 2003
