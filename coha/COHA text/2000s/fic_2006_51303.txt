Gene Wolfe reports that his new Latro novel , Soldier of Sidon , should be out in the fall . He 's also working with artist Lisa Snellings-Clark on a chapbook , the title of which will probably be Strange Birds . Word is that the chapbook will probably be published in early June . His latest tale is short but potent . <p> " YOU JUST MISSED YOUR brother , " the nurse said . Bea glanced at her watch . " He ca n't have stayed long . " It was six ; visiting hours were six to eight . " He was n't supposed to be in there , " the nurse said . " I did n't see him until he left . " Bea signed the screen and went to the elevator . It was smooth and silent - remarkably so , she thought , for a hospital built in the nineteentwenties . The corridor looked clean , though she knew the boy-high dark green and the tousled-hair-to-ceiling light green had been chosen to hide dirt . Before she was born these walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled of disinfectant instead of room deodorant . Things did n't always get better . Sometimes they got worse . Dad would go . Soon . Very soon . Go , and never come back to her . " Hello , Dad . " She gave the old man in the bed her best and brightest . " How are you feeling today ? " " Light . " His voice was thin but melodious , as if some tiny person in his throat were playing a flute . Old men were not supposed to have voices like that . For the first time it occurred to her that no one enforced such things . " Sit down , Bea . I ca n't see you . " She sat , the hospital chair so low , and the hospital bed so high , that their faces were nearly at a level . " Did Benjy come ? One of the nurses said he had . " " Him ? " The fluting little voice was not contemptuous , only tired . " He wo n't come . Never . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other eyes . Their whites were yellow . " You 're sitting . That 's good . I 've got to tell you about the bird people . " Bird watchers , she thought . " The Big Folks did n't like us , Bea . Spread poison to wipe us out . Me and Annie , we run . Maybe others run , too . I do n't know . Only there was n't any with us . It was just me and Annie for ... I do n't know . It seems long sometimes , when I think back . Only .... " " Who was Annie , Dad ? " " Maybe it was only a day or two . Maybe three before they got her . After I buried her , I just kept going deeper in to get away from them , Bea . Oh , I knew where a gate was . I just did n't want to go back . Back to what ? That was the question . That was always it . Ugly buildings on ugly streets and work I hated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it and did n't want it . " " But , Dad .... " " You wo n't ever understand why I stayed , because you wo n't ever see it . Flowers bigger than I am , and smell so sweet it got you drunk . Cold springs to drink of , and hot springs . Some so hot you had to walk a mile down to wash . Trees up to the sky , and people with wings living in them . " " Bird people , Dad ? Is that what you meant ? " " I could climb those trees , Bea , or some of them . The ones with rough bark , you know . Climb way high up . Only I did n't have wings . I 'd watch , every day . At night , when I 'd found a little hollow or something way high up , I 'd dream about it - how I 'd wake up with wings and go flying from tree to tree and sometimes way up to the tops of the tallest , up where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a minute or two I 'd think it was real and feel for my wings and try to move " em . " The old man in the bed chuckled , a ringing of wooden chimes very far away . " I 'd cry then , sometimes , Bea . Bawl like a baby . You 'd have been shamed of me . " " I 'd never be ashamed of you , Dad . " " I said the day would never come when I decided to go back , only I was wrong . I got to missing certain things and forgetting certain others , and decided I 'd had enough . I 'd learned the language , you see , or bits of it , only I 'd never be one of them . And I knew it . I told myself they were n't my kind - which was the truth - and it would be better for me to get back to my own people . Which was n't . " " Are we so bad ? " " Not you , Bea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . If I 'd had wings , I could have done it in an hour . Only I did n't , and that was the whole trouble . I had to walk , and ground was the most dangerous place . The higher you got , the safer you were . How it always was there . So I 'd go from limb to limb when I could . Sometimes they touched , and I could step over . Sometimes I had to jump , and that was risky . Sometimes there was nothing close enough . I 'd have to go down to the ground , a long climb down and a long climb back up . Scared , too . Scared every minute I was on the ground , and every minute when I was just down low . " Bea smoothed her skirt over her knees , as she always did when she was thoughtful . " There are things .. . certain things I recall from childhood , Dad . The dog that mauled Benjy when we were little .... You were never scared , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the kids . All the neighbors . " Dry and remote , the chuckle returned . " After being there ? No . No , I was n't . I 'd got away from things that would 've eaten that little doggie for a snack . You hid , too , once . Remember that ? " " When I was little , Dad ? " For the first time , Bea really saw the hospital room , all taupe and pastel green , save for the bouquet she had sent from the office . " Sure . Lots of times . Behind the couch , mostly . Under the dining room table . Even in the clothes hamper . " " Further back . " She smoothed her skirt again . " Well , it was - " " Not that time . Go back further . " " You did n't even let me say it , Dad . " " You had n't gone far enough . Your eyes told me . Further . The first time you ever hid . The very first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not going to be around much longer , Bea . " She shut her eyes , and something horrible stalked the dark , strewing its sharp stench on the sweet , moist air . " There ! That 's it . Where are you ? " " In the leaves . " She heard her own voice , and had no idea what it was talking about . " Big leaves , Dad .... " Her eyes opened . " They ca n't have been as big as that . " " You remembered . " He was trying to smile , this though Death ( invisible , ever-present ) blew each flickering smile away . " Wanted to see if you could . I found your ma , Bea . Found her on the ground one day when I was trying to get back here . She 'd hurt her wing . Hit a limb or something . She was never sure what . Not Elsie . This is n't Elsie . " " My real mother . " " That 's right , Bea . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't her name . I could n't sing the real one , so Ava 's what I called her . " " You and Mom always said I was adopted . " The flowers should have perfumed the room , but for some reason they did not . There was only odor of the spray . " It was true in a way , Bea . Elsie adopted you , and when Benjy came she treated you - " Bea shook her head . " She 's gone , Dad . Do n't get me started on how she treated me . The woman 's name was Ava ? " " No .. . not really . It was just what I called her . I could n't sing her real name . Did n't I say ? She 'd hurt her wing , the one over on the right side . It was n't cut off or anything , but she could n't fold it right , and she could n't fly . She used to lay it over us both when we slept . " Bea would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " She 's ready to die when I found her . She had n't been getting a thing to eat . I climbed , and ate some myself , and carried some down to her . " The old man 's eyes closed . " Dad ? " " Just remembering , Bea . I 'm not ready to go yet , and I wo n't go till I am . " He fell silent , breathing deeply . She waited , and at last he said , " I had to beg her to eat . I put it in her mouth and begged her to chew . All sign language , you know . I could n't sing it at all then , and I never did sing it well . Not half what they did . But I got her to eat , and she felt a little better afterward , a little stronger , and I got her to climb up a ways . Not far , but we were off the ground , and that was safer . " Bea nodded , wondering whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had been hiding so long , this irrationality ? " Pretty soon we climbed way , way up , the two of us . We built a nest up there - a better one than the flying ones did , because I knew more about building . I had more patience , too . By then I knew she was going to lay . She 'd told me , part by signs . But part by song , because I 'd got to where I could understand a little , and even sing back a bit myself . It always made her laugh , but I did n't mind . " " Elsie used to laugh at you , too , " Bea said . " That was the only time I felt sorry for you . You were so good , so competent . But you 'd try to explain baseball to her , and you never seemed to understand that she did n't want to know . " " I never did understand people who do n't want to know , Bea . " The distant flute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the instruments of music . " Now , well , maybe you do n't want to know this . About Ava and me . But it 's about you , too , so you ought to . " " And it 's been tearing you up for years , keeping it in . " Bea sighed , and wondered whether her flowers were starting to droop , just as she was . " So go on . Please go on . I want to know . " How long would the knowledge that her father had died insane tear her up ? " She laid , and it was two eggs like I knew it would be . When the women laid , it was always two . I asked about it one time and she showed me her breasts - one child for each nipple is what she said , and I still think it makes more sense than what we do . " For the rest of her life , probably . " The eggs are pretty . Not just white or brown like hens " eggs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they usually do is for the woman to warm them while the man gets something to eat , and him to while she does . But I was better at finding food than Ava was , and a better climber , so I 'd get enough for us both and bring it back to the nest , and we 'd eat it there together . " Trying to be brave , Bea nodded . " That 's nice . " " It was . It sure was . I think back , and .... " She did not know what to say . " And I wish all over again that they 'd never ended . Well , they did . Not because Ava died - she did n't , not then - but because her eggs hatched . It 's just about always a boy and a girl . Have I said that ? " " No , Dad . Not till now . " " Not always , but nearly . That 's what it was for us . The girl .... " " Oh , Dad ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings . At first I thought he was n't mine . He was just a little bit of a thing . You both were . Preemies , the doctors would 've called you . You could nurse , though , and you got bigger every day . When he was bigger , I could see he was mine after all . It was the same face I 'd had , the face I 'd seen in pictures my mother took , and he had my eye color . " Bright blue . " " That 's right . Their eyes are dark , or Ava 's were . " " Like mine , Dad ? " " That 's right . Just like yours , because it was you , Bea . You were that girl . I know you do n't remember , but you were , and you did n't have any more wings than I did . Ava pretended she was happy with it , when it tore her up something awful . I could see the hurt under the smiles , and it just broke my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She tried to make her voice and words as gentle as she could . " I 've seen him with his shirt off , seen him like that a lot of times , and he does n't . " " ' Course not , Bea . " The old man in the bed sounded a trifle impatient . " Benjy 's Elsie 's . Elsie 's and mine . This 's your full brother . " " My full brother ? " She almost felt that she and her father were conversing in a dream . " What I just said . " The old man 's eyes shut , one and then - perhaps five seconds after it - the other . She took his hand , warming it between her own and listening to his rasping breaths . Half an hour later , when she had nerved herself to speak , there was no reply . She was still holding that hand when Raeburn came in with little Megan . Raeburn said , " How is he , honey ? " She sighed , and Raeburn repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey . " He 's gone , " Bea whispered . Raeburn looked at Megan , then back to Bea . She sighed again . " She has to learn , and this is the lesson time . Megan , do you remember the toad you found in our yard ? " " All stiff . " Megan nodded , her guarantee of her own truthfulness . " Well , what happened to that toad has happened to Granddad . Come take his hand . He wo n't hurt you . " " He never done . " The old man 's cold hand was three times the size of Megan 's warm and chubby ones . " That 's right , " Bea said . " He never has and he never will . He 's with the angels , darling , where he can tell God what a good girl you are . " Megan nodded again . That night Bea-younger than Megan again-hid among leaves once more . Something huge paced the limb ; footfalls more silent than sighs thundered over her mother 's screams . Soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Raeburn was getting out of bed and searching for his slippers when she said , " Mama 's dead . " He hugged her , and his voice was as gentle as it ever became . " It 's Ace , honey . " And then , feeling she did not understand . " It 's your dad , Bea . Asa 's passed on . " " And now , " the funeral director intoned , " you may pass the coffin one by one to pay your final respects . " He was short and pudgy , with a bald head that looked like the old paint in the kitchen . " One at a time , please , and we 'll begin with the front row on this side . " She rose . The thing in the coffin might have been a badly made waxwork of her father . My father , she wanted to say , was full of life . My father was a fighter , a man even Elsie 's carping and dirt could not pull down . A man who might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed and his mind was clearly gone . A man who might really have been my father , though God knows Elsie was never my mother . She turned away to go back to her seat . Somebody sat alone in the last row of the room of repose . Benjy ? He did not look like Benjy , and certainly that big black coat - buttoned up indoors on this mild autumn day - did not look like something Benjy would wear anyplace . She walked toward him , Raeburn and Megan momentarily forgotten . He rose at once , and her soft , " Please ? " did nothing to slow his retreat . He was tall , and clearly vigorous . Though he did not run and she trotted , she was handicapped by three-inch heels and gained only slowly . She was still ten strides behind , still pleading with him , when he turned onto a nameless suburban street . By the time she reached it he was gone , though the black raincoat he had worn lay empty on the sidewalk , half covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to dread , she looked up . A bird of condor size threshed the air with eight-foot wings . When a puff of wind shook the treetops , it rose like a kite , trailing a swallow tail that might .... That could have been legs . Someone saw Bea fall to her knees , watched her pound the concrete with futile fists as she wept and screamed , and called the police . Hours afterward , Raeburn was able to explain to a sympathetic sergeant that her father 's funeral had been that day .
