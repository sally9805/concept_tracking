" <p> The residential planning is being combined with ambitious goals for DeKalb 's central area , he said . <p> " We are having the Hitchcock Design Group do a downtown plan for us , " Rasmussen said . " These are the same people who did the Naperville Riverwalk and Elgin and Aurora . The big push is to get residential development going either in the downtown or the immediate proximity .
