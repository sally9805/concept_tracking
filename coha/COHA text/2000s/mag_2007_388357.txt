Headnote Yearn to learn ? Our writer explores the ins and outs ( mostly the outs ) of continuing education classes . Have you ever noticed that so many of the things we get nostalgic about today are the very experiences we griped about yesterday ? Take school , for instance . When I was young , I could hardly wait to graduate . Then with the ink still wet on my degree , I got so homesick for the classroom , I rushed out and enrolled in all those continuing education courses . These days the choices are infinite-in addition to practical staples such as " Computer Skills , " " Languages , " and various home economics classes , one can also opt for " Belly Dancing , " " Glass Blowing , " " Standup Comedy , " " Texas Hold " Em Poker , " " Assertiveness Training , " " Juggling , " " Beer Tasting Basics , " " The Creative Divorce , " " Dog Walking , " " Introduction to Ayurveda " ( huh ? ? ? ) ... Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offerings were much less esoteric-and much less fun . First I signed up for " Basic Bridge . " The catalog description enticed me : " A great way to make interesting new friends ! " it said . Sounded promising . I was between boyfriends , and I hated singles bars . It worked . Sort of . I did meet lots of new people-but they were all females who hated singles bars . Next came the evening courses in creative writing , where I learned two very important lessons : * Beginners must expect a high percentage of rejections . ( I already knew that-from the singles bars. ) * No one can " teach " someone how to write . ( Why did n't they tell us that before we paid for the course ? ) My writing ambitions effectively squelched for the time being , I turned to another form of **26;1379;TOOLONG . In French , I swear the instructor was following the exact outline of my junior high French I course . Would you believe that the pen of my aunt is still on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since I did n't think I 'd get much mileage out of such phrases over a candlelight dinner for two at Maxim 's or an avant-garde soiree on the Left Bank , I dropped out of " Conversational French " and into " The Stock Market and You " -a magnet for men , I felt sure . ( I still hated singles bars . ) Unfortunately , all my classmates turned out to be those same women from " Basic Bridge . " I next cruised to " Powder Puff Mechanics . " Yes , in that unenlightened , pre-women's-lib era , that was actually the name of a course that promised to teach girls ( that 's what we were called then , no matter how old we were ) the mysteries of the Internal combustion engine . Obviously , I was n't going to find Mr. Right there ; but , almost as important , I would be sure to learn all there was to know about how my automobile works ( or does n't ) . Then one day I heard a funny noise in the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident I could fix the problem , whatever it was . And I 'm sure I would have been able to do just that-if only I could have figured out how to raise the hood . So much for schooling , I thought , and decided that thenceforth I 'd spend my evenings reading trashy novels . But then one morning as I was reluctantly getting ready to go to work , I said to myself , " Self ! Where are you going ? " " To work , " I replied . " Yes , " I answered , " to that same meaningless job , day after day . You should go into teaching . Think of the challenge of molding minds , changing the course of young lives ... having two months ' vacation every summer , four weeks off during the school year , staying home when it snows ... " So off I went to enroll in some education courses that I found were required . In addition to my degree , before I 'd be allowed to take two months off every summer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any education courses ? When I went to class the first day , I was sure they were putting me on . Everyone was so intense ... so serious ... so pompous , using only words of five syllables or more to explain other words of two syllables or less . I understood them , but I did n't understand them . I mean I understood all the words , but I could n't understand why the teachers felt they had to intellectualize such subjects as whether first-graders should be expected to tie their own shoelaces , which was the topic explored in ridiculous depth the first day . I did n't return the second day . Instead , I returned to my meaningless job ( which suddenly seemed more meaningful ) and my two-week annual vacation ( which still seemed like a rotten deal ) . For a long period , I swore off school-both as a teacher and teachee-until recently , when I noted in a catalog that my alma mater was offering some evening extension courses described as " Personal Fulfillment Programs . " Could I resist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal fulfillment at the time ; and if anyone was handing it out , I was going to be first in line . I registered for a program in " Communications " and eagerly awaited the first night of school . All the old nostalgic feelings came back-the anticipatory butterflies ... the yearning for a new pencil box ... the compulsion to buy a back-to-school plaid dress ... I was the first to arrive . After a while a very young man-a child , actually-walked in . I wondered if I had wandered into " Pre-Puberty Hygiene " by mistake . I said " Hi . Is this " Communications ' ' ? " He seemed offended that I had spoken to him . Oh-oh ! Was I going to be turned in for accosting a minor ? But he did n't call the cops . Instead , he nodded sulkily and pointed to the blackboard where a chalked word proclaimed that this was , indeed , " Communications . " Could have fooled me . I moved to a seat far away from him , lest he report me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . Then a girl arrived-sort of a Gidget , without the smile and dimples . I gave her a breezy " Hi ! " She gave me a frosty glare before she also shifted her gaze to space . Slowly , the room began to fill-with no one ( including me-I had learned my lesson ) greeting the new arrivals . Since we were all seated at a round table facing each other , it was getting difficult to find an area of space to stare into where someone else had n't already staked a claim . And I realized that eye contact was even more verboten than speech . I risked a glance around the room . I thought this was supposed to be adult education . What were all these children doing out after dark ? How come they did n't have to go home when the streetlights came on , like I did at their age ? And how come they were in school in their play clothes ? ( Thank God I had n't worn my new plaid dress . My tailored pantsuit was incongruous enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me put something on the table-her pocketbook , an old burlap bag held together with a rusty safety pin . I surreptitiously slipped my $200 mahogany leather purse with brass fittings under the table . I wanted to slide under there with it . Instead , I scrunched in my seat and tried desperately to wrinkle the crease in my slacks . I had even made the mistake of combing my hair . Obviously , I was a misfit . I knew I had blown any chance I might have had of getting asked to the Freshman Hop . Enough . I 've had It . My school days are finally officially over . It 's back to reading trashy novels in my free time . Hmmmm ... I just read that my library is giving a course on " The Modern Novel-Trash or Treasure ? " Maybe I 'll sign up .
