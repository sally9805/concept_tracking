Where Have All Our Children Gone ? // It was 1965 , and I was pregnant with my first child  --  very pregnant . We lived in a university town , and I was the only working wife among the group of psychiatry residents . The other women were homebound with small children , living on their husbands ? minute salaries . We were participating in the Mommy Wars long before these had a name . The other wives were jealous of my job , my freedom , our relative wealth , and the orderliness of our lives . I made them tense . At the time , I didn ? t have much sympathy for them . Competitive cooks , they did n't appreciate the Chinese takeout I served them when I entertained . They had messy kitchens , and their children were not much cleaner . Perpetually frazzled and resentful , they talked exclusively about babies , or so it seemed to me . I came to realize how difficult their job was , but at the time , I didn ? t get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that I was now pregnant . The size of my belly meant that big changes were approaching  --  especially for me ! // *** // We were leaving a birthday dinner party Harriet had thrown for her husband . She stood at the head of the steep stairs of their graduate-student housing , two flights up in an old house . The baby was on her hip , the toddler asleep on the couch . Harriet was exhausted . Her unruly red hair had curled tightly from the effort of putting on this party . Her face was shiny with sweat . She had cooked to beat the band . Harriet had removed much of the furniture in their apartment to set up tables for forty people . She ? d made bouillabaisse for us all , except for my husband , who disliked fish ; it was filet mignon for him  --  all this on a resident ? s salary . // I carefully navigated the staircase as we headed home . Harriet stood at the landing . " Just you wait , " she called . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to pee , much less take a bath . Your blue couch will be ruined in six months . Say good-bye to your clean house and your wonderful life . " I wept in the car on the way home . My feelings were hurt and I understood that it wasn ? t a prediction ; it was a curse . // *** // Life as parents did , of course , wholly change our style of living , but not exactly as Harriet had predicted . Parenting small children is a nightmare and a delight . Eventually , you do get to pee and wash your hair , the furniture is recovered or replaced , and you get used to sleeplessness . You learn to change and adjust as your children grow , which is the only way to survive those early parenting years . // Then , if you ? re lucky , time passes and you begin to enjoy a quiet winter hour before dawn . And in a split second , the kids are coming home long after you ? ve gone to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your day . When they graduate from college , when they start out in their careers , when they fall seriously in love , you think that the job is done and the challenges have been met . That just isn ? t so , as we have all lived long enough to know . When their children become adults , many parents encounter a whole new world of anxiety , miscommunication , disappointment , and distance . // The empty nest is the harbinger of this new stage , when the youngest child goes away to school and peace and quiet descend . Many people feel relief , but lingering feelings of loss and separation can wash over them . It gets too quiet . The house is too neat . People may nod when we say we 're feeling blue , but we all feel the need to shrug these feelings off . This first passage is well documented . The local paper usually runs a piece around Thanksgiving weekend , describing how when a college freshman comes home for the first time , it 's a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much more than they do about the world , and every imaginable subject . Still , the returning hero savors the taste of home cooking and sometimes even sits around and relaxes , just like old times . // One friend , whose eldest child is starting college in the fall , sighed and said , " She ? ll never live at home again . " Little does she know that for many years to come , vacations , holidays , and summers will be filled with the sound of her daughter ? s voice , with her clothing and her moods . Her school memorabilia will clutter her room  --  which had better stay her room  --  and her term papers will be stored in the house forever . Little does she know how lucky she is that her daughter is just going away to college . // *** // It ? s the second passage out that we and our children don ? t know how to navigate . We lack the language , we have no rules , and , most important , we don ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Having our kids leave home and go out on their own is for many parents the culmination of decades spent raising them . " We raised them to leave us , " we say , consoling ourselves when we are feeling lonely . Some people worry that staying close to their children will make them overly dependent , and others don ? t want to repeat the demanding attitude of their own parents . If they place a second call on the same day , they feel guilty ; if they don ? t , they feel sad . It ? s as if we are being told to keep a stiff upper lip , kiss the children on both cheeks , in the French style , shake them by the hand , and bid them farewell . Nobody can do that , nobody wants to , and nobody should . // Enter an imaginary Harriet , back at the top of the stairs : // " You think you ? re done ? You think that they ? re always going to return your calls ? When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will stop by to chat ? What about their wives and husbands ? You might not get along with them . Life as you know it is going to take a turn for the worse . " // Welcome to the stage when many parents feel that they are walking on eggshells. // *** // Of course we want our children to be independent , autonomous adults . Because parents of our generation raised our children with more freedom , we hesitate to tell them what to do . So we tell them that we are confident they will make good choices , and then we worry a lot . Some of us pray . We hope that our children will bring us their problems , their dilemmas , and their concerns , because we think we still have good advice they will want to hear . Understanding intellectually that we are no longer at the center of our children ? s lives is one thing , but in our hearts our children are still primary . // So when things are not the way we dreamed , we blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once were certain that they were terrible mothers if breast-feeding was not working now feel that they have failed when a grown son loses a job or a daughter gets divorced . Fathers who religiously coached Little League for years blame themselves when a son can not make up his mind about his choice of career . It makes us feel like fools when we wake up in the middle of the night worrying about a son or daughter , mainly because we think we are the only ones in this predicament . // Here ? s what I have found . If you are worried that your son , who is in his late thirties , still isn ? t married or that your daughter refuses to face the fact that her career is at a dead end , you are not alone . If your son is in his late twenties and still hasn ? t finished college , this is more common than you know . If your child has rejected your values , know that this is happening all around you . If after you have welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , you still can ? t meet his or her high standards of comportment , join the crowd . Some parents can not fathom where their children come off expecting major financial help . Others are miserable because their children won ? t accept money or become resentful if they do take it . Some parents miss their grown children terribly ; others are trying to figure out how to get them out of the house . // *** // On the other side of the generational divide stand our grown kids , looking for us , as we seek them . They are struggling to come to terms with their parents as people , flaws and all . When they are disappointed in us , they feel terrible . When they cause a blowup at home , they feel awful . They resent it when parents meddle and are distressed when parents try to fix everything ASAP . They become seriously annoyed or embarrassed by parents ? behavior in public . When they feel they are being judged , they become even harsher judges . They know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone ; they feel bad , but they have a job to do and a life to lead  --  they ? re busy . They want to bridge the gap with their parents . But as much as they love us  --  and the young people I talked with expressed great depths of love  --  they struggle to get it right , just as we do . Signs that we are trying to listen to them and accept them fully are met with pleasure and often with a response that shows they are trying to see us for who we are , too . // As I listened to people ? s stories , I realized that parents and their grown children are playing a new version of an old childhood game , blindman ? s bluff . One person is blindfolded and then tries to catch one of the other players , all of whom try to keep out of that person ? s way . But now both generations are wearing blindfolds , as parents and their grown children stumble around trying to find one another . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more loaded than money . It stands for love , judgment , and responsibility . It is also a symbolic torch passing from one generation to another . Grown children may still expect to get what they want , even as their parents understand that they will soon be the ones in need . // Great Expectations // One of my favorite family stories from childhood took place one night when my brother and I were small . We were sitting around the dinner table and one of us piped up with this : " Daddy , when you die , can I have your watch ? " I remember the surprise on my father ? s face , and then his laughter . We were tiny , and he was young , and he had many years  --  and possibly many watches  --  to go before his death . I wouldn ? t have minded if my children had asked such a question when they were young , but I ? m not so sure how well it would sit with me today . Melanie ? s story made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great spirit , she entertains with verve , she laughs a lot , and at sixty-eight she hasn ? t lost the light in her eyes , which reminds her friends of the party girl she used to be . With a shake of her head , an entrancing smile , and a mahogany laugh , Melanie has flirted with heads of state and great artists . She drinks , she smokes , she cusses , and she has a great heart . A widow with three grown children , Melanie tells me about her troubles with Julia , the only professional of the three . Julia , a tiny woman with jet black hair and very fine features , is lively and smart and sings like an angel . Her spirit fills her wonderful Brooklyn brownstone with laughter , and her three children glow with the love of their family . Julia practices public-interest law , and her husband heads the legal-aid office in their borough . Melanie ? s second child is a writer , although she just gets by doing this . She is divorced from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The third child , a son , is a brilliant maverick , who lives in the Southwest , composes music , and is deeply spiritual . He ? s always low on cash . // Melanie ? s life is centered on her family . Her husband died more than a decade ago , and she has turned her energy and focus on the children and grandchildren . She recognizes that she should broaden the focus of her life but can not seem to do that . She has turned from party girl into earth mother , a role she has embraced fully . Melanie has been dipping into the capital of her small inheritance to take care of herself  --  and her children . She calculates how many years she has left of Mike ? s money , and she figures it will last a decade . It is running out , and Melanie worries . Of course her children know this . All three are very close to their mother . Melanie has her daughters and their families over for Sunday dinner every week , she throws the grandchildren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she takes one grandson to spring training every year , and she shops with his sister . They all share a summer rental in the country every year . They are as close-knit a family as you can get . When she visits her musician son , Melanie sleeps on a futon  --  and her bones send out distress messages . // A year or two ago , Julia and her husband were refinancing their house to make some improvements , and she asked her mother for a loan of ten thousand dollars , to be repaid when the bank financing came through . Melanie was thrilled to be able to write out a check for the loan . Then the refinancing didn ? t go through and the improvements did , and Julia couldn ? t repay the money . She asked her mother to forgive the loan and make it a gift . // For Melanie , ten thousand dollars is a considerable part of a year ? s living expenses , and Melanie told her daughter she couldn ? t forgive the loan , since her finances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother ? s face that she had been awarded scholarships throughout college and hadn ? t cost her parents anything , while they had paid for her sister ? s college tuition . And what about her brother ? He was always asking his mother for help , she knew . It wasn ? t fair , and it wasn ? t equitable . It bothered Melanie deeply that Julia didn ? t seem to be concerned that she was running out of money . After two days of total misery , Melanie relented . She couldn ? t bear her daughter ? s anger ; their relationship is crucial to Melanie ? s well-being . // Melanie knows that her second daughter , who just gets by , would sacrifice everything for her , but that doesn ? t cure this situation . She doesn ? t want to have to take anything from her children . The question of money turns into the question of age , the future , and who will depend on whom . It is a painful subject , and it kills Melanie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headings for this publication : // Parent and adult child . // Baby boom generation  --  Family relationships . // Adult children  --  Family relationships . //
