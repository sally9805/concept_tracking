<p> *** <p> Patti Smith , " Land ( 1975-2002 ) " ( Arista ) Rock <p> " I have n't messed with the past but I 've messed plenty with the future ! " Patti Smith famously chanted in lyrics that are reprinted as the central art in this two-disc anthology . Actually , the punk poetess has been rewriting her history for years now ( see her book , Patti Smith Complete , which is anything but ) , so this box set is overdue . But once again , there are fewer revelations than hardcore fans might expect . <p> The first disc is a solid but skimpy greatest hits collection with the tracks allegedly chosen by the fans  --  though if that were really the case , one would suspect more than 10 songs from Smith 's groundbreaking first four albums ( we get " Dancing Barefoot , " " Gloria , " " Free Money "  --  all the expected tunes ) and fewer than seven from her spotty post-comeback career ( " Summer Cannibals , " " 1959 , " " Beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Doves Cry " by Prince is a nice bonus ) . <p> The second disc is more rewarding : Here is a sampling of demos and live tracks that show the Patti Smith Group in its element , improvising onstage or exploding in the recording studio , emphasizing spontaneity . and drawing on the energy of the crowd . Sometimes the musicians fall flat on their faces ( " Higher Learning , " or any occasion on which Smith breaks out her clarinet ) , but more often they transcend the moment and capture magic ( a demo of " Redondo Beach " from 1975 , or a live " Wing " from 2001 ) . <p> After such a long wait , it would have been nice if Arista gave us more of this sort of material  --  surely a three-disc rarities set is in order for a band with so much history ?  --  and kept the superficial overview to a single budget-priced CD . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> *** Jimmy Buffett , " Far Side of the World " ( Mailboat ) Pop <p> Jimmy Buffett 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean corner . After all , a guy who makes a yachtload of coin every summer playing paeans to fruity drinks and cheeseburgers wo n't exactly win over a grass-skirted lawn crowd by suddenly switching into sensitive singer-songwriter mode . But as he sings on his 33rd release , " I like music in my music , " and " Far Side of the World " represents Buffett taking a swing at being something other than Summer Song Singalong Guy and scoring refreshingly well . <p> Largely a throwback to his countrified " Come Monday " glory days , " Far Side " ( mostly ) dispenses with the self-conscious routine and goofy gimmicks that have plagued most of Buffett 's recent studio releases ( I 'm looking at you , " Math Suks " ) in favor of acoustic guitars , violins , accordions and excellent song selection . The opener " Blue Guitar " settles right into Buffett 's familiar style with its African chants , Caribbean steel drums and acoustic plucking , and " Savannah Fare You Well " and Bruce Cockburn 's " All The Ways I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything here makes it into the summer setlist , it 'll be " What If the Hokey Pokey Is All It Really Is About , " a typical ode to the simple life that 's tailor-made for crowd participation . Anyone getting tickets to the summer show may want to start practicing now . <p> Jeff Vrabel <p> ***1/2 Clinic , " Walking With Thee " ( Domino ) Rock <p> Indie-rock hipsters are hailing this Liverpool quartet as the second coming of Radiohead ; the promising newcomers are giving us sounds to tide us over in between proper releases by the new age answer to Pink Floyd . But on the group 's second album ( the first with a major push in America ) , I hear a lot more venom and vinegar a la early Public Image , Ltd. , Wire or Gang of Four ; a devotion to the monotonous trance groove that 's pure Velvet Underground or Can , and a nifty way with subtle hooks that 's certainly stronger than Thom Yorke &; Co . <p> Songs such as the disc-opening " Harmony , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gleefully obtuse " Sunlight Bathes Our Home " have the power to worm their way into your subconscious , evoking myriad cool influences ( from the bands listed above , to surf music or spaghetti Western soundtracks ) , while sounding fresh , vital , and mysterious all at once . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> *** Little Charlie &; the Nightcats , " That 's Big ! " ( Alligator ) Blues <p> A better resume for a jump-swing revival band could never be written . But Sacramento , Calif. , bluesmen Little Charlie &; the Nighcats are comfortable in their mellow-down-easy groove , so do n't expect to hear them in dance halls with a pickup horn section any time soon . <p> That 's good news for those who 've long admired the virtuosic harmonica playing and witty songwriting of Rick Estrin and the smooth , fluid guitar work of Little Charlie Baty . The 30-year partners are joined here by the new rhythm section of drummer Joe Ventittelli and bassist Frankie Randall , and the sound is as consistent as ever . <p> That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's Big ! " There are no songs as good as Estrin 's " My Next Ex-Wife " on the disc , and there 's a nagging feeling that you 've heard some of these tunes before . But the Nightcats are true to their roots , and that 's the good news . <p> Jeff Johnson <p> *1/2 <p> Brandy , " Full Moon " ( Atlantic ) R &B; <p> Kids today , they grow up so darn fast ! That 's the theme of the third album by Brandy , who 's returning to her first love , music , after five years of starring in UPN 's " Moesha . " But with a history as a professional performer dating back 21 years to the grand old age of 2 , you might think it would be time for her to retire . <p> The obvious role model throughout these songs ( and in the cover art ) is Aaliyah , but Brandy lacks that singer 's cool allure or vocal pizzazz . Nor has Brandy blossomed into a woman who is large and in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically , she 's just trying to look pretty and chirp along unobtrusively as the best mainstream hack R &B; producer that money can buy delivers totally unremarkable grooves and fixes her vocals in the mix with his Pro-Tools pitch shifter . <p> Rodney Jerkins is now officially the new millennial Babyface  --  a crafter of oh-so-slick , instantly forgettable , totally soulless soul music that simply screams , " product ! " The only glimmer of spark on this 17-song disc is the very last tune , a flat reading of P.M. Dawn 's " I 'd Die Without You " ( incorrectly retitled here ) , but even that boasts only a slight fraction of the emotion that Prince Be brought to the original . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> **1/2 Midnight Oil , " Capricornia " ( Liquid Records ) Rock <p> When it first gained widespread attention here with 1987 's " Diesel and Dust , " the Aussie rock band Midnight Oil was a furious outfit in both sound and vision . With shaven-headed lead singer Peter Garrett , a sort of Mr. Clean with a cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice that sounded a bit like Kate Hepburn on steroids , the band offered agit-pop for a new generation with songs including " Beds Are Burning " and " The Dead Heart . " <p> With their latest , however , Garrett and band seem a bit weary . From the raga rock of " Tone Poem " to the ballad " Under the Overpass , " the music virtues remain but the fight is now being carried out by Marquis de Queensbury rules . They 're older , wiser , maybe , but also a little less engaging . <p> Jeff Wisser <p> ***1/2 <p> Kasey Chambers , " Barricades and Brick Walls " ( Warner Bros . ) Country <p> On this stunning outing , Aussie cowgirl Kasey Chambers splits the difference between insurgent country 's two greatest Williamses , Hank and Lucinda . With an aching , almost breaking voice that recalls Iris DeMent and her musical attack that mixes traditional virtues with a little jagged electricity , Chambers demands attention , notably on the title track and the hard-rocking " Crossfire . " <p> Jeff Wisser <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cares " ( Zoe ) Celtic rock <p> Newfoundland 's Great Big Sea , heard recently on the soundtrack of " The Shipping News , " can kick it with the best of them when they 're producing more traditional Celtic sounds on songs such as the crackling-good " Scolding Wife , " " A Boat Like Gideon Brown " and " Barque in the Harbor . " But when they go the folk-rock route , as on the title track here , it 's just so much Hothouse Flowers Lite . A little more firepower from the rhythm section might lend this melodic but generic material a little more distinction . <p> Note : Great Big Sea will perform Sunday at Metro . <p> Jeff Wisser
