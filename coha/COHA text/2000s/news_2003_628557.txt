<p> No video or cameras . No moshing . No acting like you 've been raised by wolves ( or the Osbournes ) . <p> Not every concert " do n't " gets printed on your ticket . But maybe they need to be . At venues large and small , indoors and out , concertgoers are complaining more frequently about their fellow music fans ' behavior . <p> For the most part , it 's not violence or other arrest-worthy offenses . It 's a general disregard for others that 's causing all the vexation . <p> We want you to have a good time at the show . We want everyone to have a good time . So we turned to an expert for a quick refresher course on concert etiquette . <p> Roadie Girl , the Miss Manners of the Mosh Pit , gave us her biggest beefs about . . . well , we wo n't print what she actually called concertgoers who rankle her . Long years on the road hauling gear and dodging empty beer cups tossed onstage have given her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you recognize yourself in the list below , consider the error of your ways before attending your next concert - or risk Roadie Girl 's wrath . <p> Take it away , Roadie Girl : <p> TIPS FOR BANDS <p> TOO LOUD IS SO LAME : When the volume is so over-the- top that fans ' ears are bleeding , the only possible conclusion is that you 're using a big sound to compensate for something that 's very , very small ( i.e. talent ) . A real band is confident enough to keep the volume at a level where the crowd can actually hear the music . <p> MUSIC , NOT MAYHEM : Guilty nu-metal parties , you know who you are : Encouraging the crowd to beat up security guards does not make you cool . It only makes you seem like even more of a desperate dork than the gimmicky costumes you 're wearing . <p> CAN YOU HEAR ME ? : A special request for rap acts : Any Idiot can get on stage and waste time demanding to know which side of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapping . <p> SOME FEEDBACK FOR YA : Leaving the stage with your guitar leaning against the amp , creating an ear-splitting wave of feedback , is not an appropriate adieu to fans whose money is putting food on your table , clothes on your back and groupies in your tour bus . " But I saw ( insert name of classic rock act of your choosing here ) do it . " Yeah , pal , so did everyone else - a zillion times , too . If you 're going to do something really annoying , at least try to make it original . <p> I BET YOU SAY THAT TO ALL THE FANS : " It 's great to be here . " " You 're the best crowd ever . " Instead of empty cliches , play like you mean it , and we 'll still love and respect you in the morning . <p> DO US ALL A FAVOR : Do n't like touring ? Dread the thought of having to sing your songs night after night in front of people you 'd never , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please . Leave the making of music to people who feel it in their souls and will not show up on stage drunk or indifferent , forget the lyrics or chords and head back to the tour bus after a set that was shorter than sound check . <p> TIPS FOR FANS <p> IT 'S " WILL CALL , " NOT " WE 'LL WAIT " : Picking up tickets at the will call window ? Bring a photo ID and the credit card used to place the order . Because no matter how many times you say " I left it in my car , " the box office staffer does n't care . And neither do all the people waiting in line behind you . <p> A DAB 'LL DO YA : The band should n't stink , and neither should you . Whether it 's pricey perfume or cheap cologne , do n't drown yourself in it - because Roadie Girl is tired of listening to allergy-afflicted concertgoers gripe about hives , migraines and asthma attacks triggered by other fans ' Obsession overload . <p> ZIP IT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there hears his favorite song live is thoughtful . Yakking away on a phone , or with the rest of your group , during the band 's quiet , acoustic number is lame . If the conversation is so urgent that it wo n't wait , take it to the concessions area . <p> STAND IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE : At general Admission shows , if you 're not there early enough to land a spot right in front , deal with the spot you 've got . Do n't do the sardine shuffle , looking for a person who 's shorter or skinnier to bully with your bulk as you weasel your way closer . <p> WE 'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER : If you see someone fall or get squashed to the point of passing out , get security 's attention . And when the security and first-aid people try to pass through , let them . Helping a fellow fan or moving aside to allow the professionals to do their jobs takes seconds and will not ruin the show for you . <p> MANAGE YOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prohibited in many venues ) , do n't start a pit in the middle of an unsuspecting crowd , and do n't slam into bystanders . Not everyone wants Ozzfest scars to show the grandkids . <p> STAY GROUNDED : Remember , concerts are a collective experience . Dance , sing along , whatever , but do n't do it at the expense of others ' enjoyment . Memo to chicks on their boyfriends ' shoulders and anybody standing on their seat : That flashlight the security guard is shining in your face is not part of the light show . Get your feet back on the ground and stop blocking everyone else 's view . <p> Likewise , if everyone behind you is sitting , heed the shouts of " Down in front ! " " But I paid good money ! " you say ? Yeah , so did the people behind you - and it was n't to have your wiggling rear in their faces . ( The same goes for homemade signs . ) <p> IT 'S LIVE MUSIC , NOT A LIBRARY : The flip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you expect to sit in your seat all night with an unobstructed view of the band , hearing nothing but their dulcet notes , buy a concert DVD instead of a concert ticket . If you do come to the show , do n't spend your time picking fights over every nudge , bump and off-key sing-along . <p> HECKLING IS PASSE : During comedy shows or unplugged sets , just because it 's quiet enough for your shouted comments to be heard does n't mean you should make them . If you were that funny or clever , you 'd be the one on stage , buddy . <p> DO N'T GIVE A TOSS : No matter how awful the act is , the only thing that should be hurled at the stage is verbal abuse . Oh , and throwing things at other people in the crowd ? It tells everyone you 're a pathetic loser and might get you ejected ( which probably will be the only time you hear people applauding for you ) . <p> A PLEA FROM ROADIE BOY : Yes , fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' room is often bigger than your bladder . Sometimes , a chick 's got ta do what a chick 's got ta do - in the boys ' room . If you do duck in to the men 's room to take care of business , Roadie Boy told us to tell you : eyes straight ahead and no primping in the mirrors . Go in , get on with it and get outta there . <p> <p> Mark your calendar <p> Here are five upcoming concerts that have us stoked : <p> Friday : Nelly at the Verizon Wireless Theater <p> July 20 : Vans Warped Tour featuring Tsunami Bomb , Mad Caddies and Yellowcard at Reliant Center <p> Aug. 2 : Jay-Z and 50 Cent at the Woodlands Pavilion <p> Aug : 10 : Lollapalooza featuring Jane 's Addiction , Audioslave and the Donnas at the Woodlands Pavilion <p> Aug. 12 : Weird Al Yankovic at Verizon Wireless Theater
