FIRST THE FLOODING , THEN THE ROSES . Now this . It was too much-was n't it ? Could n't it , she wondered , at some point become simply too much ? <p> Roberta preferred not dwelling on her own sorrows , especially when greater misery was widespread . She considered herself practical , level-headed if unimaginative , one who took what life offered and made do . Ben had chided her for this , her quiet , unsurprised doggedness ; it could enrage him sometimes . But he had relied on it also , Roberta knew , been grateful , that hard year especially . Now , as the pelting rain , oddly warm , picked up again , Roberta mugged the hood of her jacket and watched from several yards away as wet darkened the upholstery of her car through the open door . She had not left it that way , never would . Blinking , she could visualize the purse on the seat where she had put it , but the illusion would n't hold . The purse was gone , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken them had n't even bothered to close the door . <p> She was alone . LuAnne had driven off ; Frances and her boys were rumbling away in the truck . Roberta raised a hand in their direction , but too late ; they were already leaving the park . Standing there , for a tense moment she had no idea what to do . Her surety-what Ben had called her " rock-solid sense " - was vanished , in its place not so much panic as absence , which was , if possible , more disturbing . <p> Something jittered on the floorboard as water dripped from the steering wheel , something bright , a piece of paper . Roberta could hear rain on the gravel lot , the engorged river sweeping through the trees beyond it . Birds shifted without sound in the branches ; something dragged in the current , slapping the water . She had to tug the hood of her jacket twice more before she could make herself step toward the car . <p> That morning , the roses upset her most . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , examining the broader situation from every angle , but there it was . Of course she felt badly-how could she not ? - when the flood cut off the entire south side , when the National Guard was sandbagging City Hall and the downtown shops , when in the paper were pictures of children wading knee-deep in the current on Third-where were the parents ? - though everyone had been warned about raw sewage , hepatitis , God only knew what else . <p> On the news a family had to salvage what they could in Safeway carts ( the woman looked a little like one of Cheryl 's classmates , she could n't dredge up the name ) . They filmed them approaching the bridge in a ragged procession , father in a Seahawks cap holding an infant , two older children , grimy , arms full of plastic bags , staring without interest at the camera . They 'd been out of their house only two days but looked like war refugees , plodding , hollow-eyed , the mother wearing a green parka over a longer coat , shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the weatherman forecast several more days of rain , the camera panned over their heads to the motor court , where filthy water , still rising , lapped the steps of their home . He paused solemnly so his viewers could take it all in . <p> Roberta disliked this new weatherman , whose delivery , speaking of the flood , tilted alternately toward the jaunty and the grave . He moved before his cartoon maps , trailing , through some technical chicanery , jet streams and storm fronts from his fingers . Rough sailing , he said . Pioneer spirit . We may be down , Oregon , but we 're not out . He was fit and handsome and winning and would have made a fine game-show host , Roberta thought-all that easy , disarming , fraudulent charm . Trust me , he invited you . You 'll enjoy it . <p> Roberta preferred the old weatherman , Larry-an honest , straight  --  forward name , not like this one , Bryce or Brock . Larry was flushed and unfit , inclined toward panic . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened to come loose , his tie go flapping . From the first , he seemed stopgap , ripe for replacement , which , it turned out , he was . He was a pessimist , one of the things Roberta liked best about him , and a worrier . He reported mudslides and stationary low fronts and the inevitable weeks of rain with a petulant regret , as if all this bad news were , in some way he had n't yet been able to figure , partly his fault . Roberta had looked forward to seeing him every morning , again at six o'clock , following his unswerving decline with affection . She hoped he was off forecasting someplace warm and predictable , Arizona , for example , though she doubted it . <p> Wherever he was , good luck to him , Roberta thought , straightening the placemat and napkin , putting out tea and honey , the wheat crackers and jam she nibbled for breakfast . He was worlds better than Bruce , Brick , whatever , this pretty twit who occasionally sat at the news desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewers , what they called-could there be a more ridiculous term ? what then , for mercy 's sake , were famine and plague and war ? - what they called " human-interest stories . " <p> But he was n't the point , Roberta reminded herself as they returned to footage of the flood , the south side accessible now only by boat . Mudslides upstate , houses carried off their moorings . Farmers appealing for help , their livestock stranded by rising water . Could anyone see this and not be moved ? <p> She had dialed the high school , where they 'd set up a shelter-she could hand out clothing , help with the cooking-but was told they were fully staffed . When she offered to write a check , the young woman asked her to hold . Over the line came running , something heavy being moved . When the young woman returned she had forgotten what Roberta had said . She 'd like to help , Roberta repeated . If they did n't need volunteers surely they could use her money . " That 's sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice that suggested the opposite . Roberta got the feeling she was trying the woman 's patience . They were n't organized for receiving funds , she was told . Maybe the mayor 's office , or the Red Cross . Had she tried the Humane Society ? Tomorrow , Roberta had decided , stiffly thanking the woman , she would go down there anyway-there were old blankets , some of Ben 's work shirts , probably a pair of pants or two . Surely someone could use them . Humane Society , indeed . <p> The news was over , the newscasters , only marginally less comic than Brick , actually waving good-bye . Roberta shut off the small black-and  --  white , allowed herself another cracker . She needed to find those blankets . She thought of turning on the radio to the classical station while she finished her tea but decided against it . She went to the pot for more water , just a half cup this time , and sat back at the table . The refrigerator hummed ; rainwater ticked from one of the gutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . This silence was lonely , or comforting , or sometimes , like today , simply familiar , and welcome for that . The roses-her responsibility , after all-returned to her , and she tried to empty her mind . Past Ben 's seat , beyond her arrangement of shells and twigs and dried flowers , the viburnum swayed in the rain , the rhododendron and hedgerow azaleas just coming into bud . <p> At the park , Roberta stood with LuAnne , the Society 's oldest member , and Frances , its president . LuAnne was near eighty , bless her , and she looked at Roberta and Frances , her eager , animated face flitting between hope and alarm . She had come dressed for work , in pressed bluejeans and new tennis shoes , a sweatshirt embroidered with plaid sheep . LuAnne had been there at the start of the Society thirty years ago , when the city gave them the land . When she retied her plastic rain hat Roberta saw a half-inch border of gray down the part of her pageboy , where the reddish-brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of his hunting jackets , had sent her boys down early this morning , and when they reported the situation she had put out the call , summoning Roberta from her kitchen . The boys were here now , with a truckload of sand and shovels and coarse nylon bags . Roberta could n't help wondering just what she and LuAnne were supposed to do with fifty-pound sacks-it was just like Frances not to think of that-but it did n't matter now . They had missed their chance . <p> The river had crested overnight . Trees that yesterday had lined the banks were now isolated trunks fighting the current , and before them , covering the road and half the rose garden beyond it , was a wide , churning lane of brown water , wood chips , and debris . Far out , near Cheryl 's pergola , water was seeping into the lanes between the beds ; closer , the floribunda and hybrid teas were underwater , some visible only by their uppermost stems , pathetically bobbing . <p> The boys were on the cellphone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join him there . Frances held a shovel , turning her head as if the landscape had disappointed her , and they watched the rushing water , color of weak coffee . Now and then small whirlpools gathered , foamed up , as some new drainage was reached . <p> " Well , ladies , " Frances said . She tossed the shovel in the dirt as if it , too , had failed her . " That 's all she wrote . " This set LuAnne to crying , as Frances knew it would . In her youth Frances had ranched east of the mountains , which she liked to think had determined her character . She was big-boned , martial , wore her hair emphatically gray and close to the skull . She spoke in clipped dispatches meant to indicate she had no time for fools or their dawdling conversation . " These are dead . " She pointed at the closer plants . " Rest 'll be gone tomorrow . " <p> She had probably overstated the matter ; it was too soon to suppose the plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roberta moved to comfort LuAnne , now openly weeping , the plaid sheep on her sweatshirt in tiny convulsions . She was a dear old woman , made turn  --  overs and cherry pies she could no longer have because of diabetes , and she would stop by for coffee , sit in your kitchen and smile as she watched you eat . LuAnne thought the absolute best of everyone , saw nothing in the world but good intentions , which could be maddening , Roberta had to concede ; still , Frances went too far . <p> She collected tidbits from the news that she weekly presented LuAnne as they pruned or grafted , tilled or cleared the beds : food handlers with impetigo ; day-care workers on drugs ; that minister in Sweet Home who ran off with a cheerleader ; the principal in Umatilla spotted in his backyard wearing a pleated skirt and stockings . Frances related these facts without apparent malice , though there had to be some , Roberta knew . There was other news out there , not all of it bad . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome tiring-LuAnne , her lower lip atremble , mute and wide-eyed like a six  --  year-old hoping the frightful story will reveal itself a dream , wrapped snug in a heartening moral-she could not entirely disapprove the message : Wake up . Look around , for God 's sake . Stop kidding yourself . <p> Frances assessed the two of them now , her broad face satisfied , as if all this were anticipated , the weeks of warm rain and snowmelt , the flooding of the town and their garden , all culminating , as she knew it must , in LuAnne 's predictable and useless whimpering . Pushing her cap back , she left the shovel for the boys to retrieve and waited in the truck while they finished talking to their dad . <p> Roberta spoke quietly to LuAnne , who looked at her with blue , entreating eyes . " Thank you , " she kept saying to Roberta , " thank you , " and Roberta thought impatiently , For what ? She had to fight the urge to say something snappish , mean . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with the seatbelt and stood watching as first she , then Frances and the boys , pulled out of the lot . At the entrance LuAnne paused to check traffic both ways , twice , and behind her in the truck Frances pounded the horn . It was then Roberta turned to her own car , farther off in the lot , and saw she must have left the door open to the rain , something she would never do , something she quickly realized was impossible . <p> Happiness , when it presented itself , was a shock , a sudden chance , like sun breaking through the clouds in this godforsaken state . Even as a kid Abby had recognized this , been poised to seize the moment before it passed . Example : the unlocked car . <p> They 'd been fighting since last night-for weeks , really , if you wanted to be accurate . Dale would get this way , when nothing could please him , when every circumstance was confirmation of some stupidity , of fate stacking the odds . " Fuck , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fuckin ' A. " When it had become Abby 's role , her job , to anticipate these moods , deflect them , convince Dale that things were really on the upswing-when this had become her duty , she could n't remember . But it was . <p> Men were imbeciles . Abby knew this , had known it forever . How to reconcile that fact with her need to be with one was a problem she had set aside for future examination , along with Would she ever go back to college , Would she later in life come to regret the tattoos ( she secretly anticipated a no to the first , a yes to the second ) , and Which part of the country would she finally settle in , assuming it would even be in this country and not abroad someplace , like Europe or Mexico . She 'd deal with those questions later . For now , Dale and his moods were plenty . <p> She did well enough , usually . She could make him laugh with her imitations of TV personalities . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased , acted like she craved sex all the time , day or night , which , sadly , was less and less the case . With a certain look , she could still muster his attention instantly , which was important , and sometimes she pulled her shirt off in the middle of a conversation just to see his face go all boy-slack and hungry , and sometimes she stuck a tit in his mouth just to stop his complaining a minute or two . <p> It was Dale 's idea to drive north , though Abby had been happy in Arcata , liked the views and the park in the middle of town where everyone ran dogs . People were friendly ; they waved even when they did n't know your name . But Dale was restless . The band he 'd agreed to manage , Gary Gilmore , was n't getting any gigs , which of course they blamed on him and not on their lack of talent . The weed he was selling fell through when his supplier in Sacramento would n't return his calls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke , as he 'd known it would be from the start . <p> So one day he 's on the phone with somebody named Colby , laughing , telling stories , and it 's Colby Central all of a sudden , Colby this and Colby that , best dude Dale knew back in college , the funniest , most generous , wildest partier ever . Abby would n't believe some of the stunts he 'd pulled with Colby , Abby would love Colby , wait till she met Colby . But Abby could n't suppress a weary skepticism . She had weathered enough of Dale 's abrupt enthusiasms to question their staying power or likelihood , in the long run , of producing much . And there was the name , for one thing . Was n't that like a cheese or something ? <p> Still , she had agreed . They were on the futon in Slam 's mother 's basement , between the wet bar and the big-screen TV . Slam was the drummer in Gary Gilmore , and his mother had let them stay when Slam told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer and some of the Beach Boys . They 'd had sex and were sneaking a cigarette  --  Slam 's mother did n't allow smoking-Abby 's favorite part of the day , not talking , but together . <p> After six months she still had to shake herself to believe she was with him . She had imagined herself many places , with all sorts of people , yet never with someone like Dale . Good-looking did n't begin to cover it for Dale ; neither did handsome . He was-there was just no other word  --  beautiful . Eye-catching , breath-stopping , **29;1650;TOOLONG  --  up beautiful . With his sleepy gray eyes and amused smile , his brown  --  gold hair loose to the shoulders , his shambling grace-she 'd never seen him in an awkward moment-he was like someone with a secret , always at the center of a good time . Everyone , girls on the street , even guys , even Slam 's worried , dried-out mother , everyone wanted to be around him , catch a little of that glow . <p> They had met at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what part of the house he was in , who he was talking to . He was like a rock star , she thought , or a Kennedy-every move relaxed , cool , but also generous somehow . When he finally talked to her on the porch , when later he slid her into his arms , when they left together and woke up together and all of a sudden were hanging out , a couple , she had felt swept up by something at last , as if meeting Dale were what she had been meant for . Her life filled with trajectory for the first time , with purpose . Loving Dale was what she did . <p> He was lying back on the futon , watching the ceiling . Every so often he 'd pass her the cigarette . She wondered what he thought about after sex , dreamily looking up as if admiring or reliving their passion , or maybe his ability to satisfy her with what seemed hardly any effort at all on his part . This aspect of their lovemaking had embarrassed Abby at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried her through the days . Lately , though , sex , even the pleasure of it , had become awkward , almost annoying , indicating something in them both she could n't quite locate but did n't much care for . <p> There was this girl , Calypso . Abby had met her in Arcata with her dog , Max , a poodle-something mix with a red bandana . His collar was little dancing bears . Max had trotted over to where Abby was sitting in the park , and without so much as a howdy-do shoved his snout right into her crotch , snuffling and burrowing there as if he 'd lost something and finally remembered where . Calypso had yanked him off and tried to act mad , but when she saw Abby was n't angry-flustered , maybe ; people were looking over and smiling-they 'd gotten to talking . Max was famous for this behavior , Calypso explained . The guys-she indicated a group of young men practicing flips on their skateboards beyond the monument-called him The Diver . The vet said neutering might help , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just female humans , which was mysterious , did n't Abby think ? Karma-wise . And what if they put him through it , the operation , and it did n't address the problem ? Then what ? They were on the grass , Max stretched between them , batting one or another from time to time for attention . " I mean , they neuter you , " Calypso said , shivering , scratching Max behind an ear . " What a concept . " <p> It turned out Calypso waitressed in this coffee place on the square where the work was easy and the money OK and the manager always looking for new girls . She was absolutely sure he would like Abby . Did she know lattes and such ? Did she have something tight to wear for the interview ? Calypso had plenty ; she could borrow . Any time , Calypso said , each of them rubbing one of Max 's ears now , his big head thrashing in pleasure . Any time . just give her the word . <p> Abby was so into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rents . She 'd circled two , a furnished one-bedroom near the park and a studio " with extras , " which sounded promising . If Dale could stick it out at the hotel a little longer they could move out of Slam 's mother 's basement when Abby 's checks started coming in ; they could start looking even now . She had waited all evening to tell him but had n't gotten the chance , and then tonight , after he 'd made sure she was satisfied  --  he always did , was very considerate that way-he 'd rolled off her and reached for the cigarettes . " News , babe , " he said , turning his head so the smoke would n't get in her eyes . " Colby 's given the green light . Next stop , Oregon . " <p> Now he was dozing , cigarette smoldering in an outstretched hand , a sheen of sweat on his face and chest . She thought of nudging him  --  accidentally , so to speak-thought of leaving the For Rents out by the bed , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the places anyway , ask Calypso to come along . In her head she saw herself with her green suitcase meeting Calypso in the park , the two of them walking off together with Max . <p> Twice she opened her mouth to wake him , but did n't . She looked at the far wall , at the beer signs Slam 's dead father had collected . Even in the dark they glinted a little : Schlitz , Miller High Life , a couple in German the old guy was apparently proud of . Eventually she put out the cigarette , got up and cracked a window , and climbed back beside Dale . She only had to move near him for him to put an arm out and hold her . She thought once more of waking him but gave up the idea-there was somehow both too much to say and not enough . Drifting off , she could hear Slam 's mother , a bad sleeper , moving around in the kitchen upstairs . In the morning they packed the van and headed up 101 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Melissa 's fault , as far as Dale could make out ; marriage had about ruined him . They had a couple of good nights , drinking , smoking Dale 's weed , remembering old times . They had a barbecue with hamburgers and corn and beer , the men wearing yellow slickers in the rain , laughing and choking in the smoke . Abby and Melissa watched from inside , made salad and peach cobbler . <p> Then Melissa started begging off early , Colby too , saying he was really dragging at work . Take anything you want from the fridge , he 'd say , just turn the TV down a notch . From the pull-out in the living room Abby could hear them whispering . One morning Melissa stopped talking altogether , just came out in her suit and heels-she was some kind of broker-grabbed a Diet Coke and two oranges , and left . Colby was uncomfortable , and so was Abby , but Dale looked on serenely , comically widening his eyes when Melissa slammed the car door and drove off . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation , Melissa was the problem ; that should be clear to everyone , including Colby , the poor shmuck who 'd married a bitch and was now embarrassed , but mostly relieved to have his old bud Dale around to break up the monotony . <p> Wrong , as usual . <p> When Dale saw she was n't finishing her eggs , he swept them onto his plate , doused them with salsa . Colby was a pharmacy student , final year , which had given rise to some broad jokes . He looked worn out . Abby had offered him eggs , but he declined , though he accepted coffee . He stood at the stove drinking as Dale mopped the eggs with toast , and as Abby looked at him , then away , then at the table in front of her . <p> " Jesus , " Dale said around a mouthful . " What flew up her ass ? " <p> " Dale , " Abby said , and Colby said nothing . " Melissa looks tired , " Abby said to him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wipes you right out . " <p> " Yeah , " Colby said . " So . " He drained the coffee and put the mug down . He gathered some papers from the table . " So , " he said again . <p> " Dude . Any luck with the apartment ? The job hunt ? " <p> " Nah . " Dale waved off the question . " Jobs suck here , man . Bad as California . Apartments are even suckier . " <p> " You 've looked ? " Colby said . <p> Dale turned his face up , still chewing . He watched Colby and swallowed . <p> Colby talked to Abby now . There was something in his eyes , pleading , or the beginning of anger , something . " Listen , " he said . " You guys made any plans ? " <p> Dale waited until he had swallowed again , brought a napkin to his mouth . " Bro , " he said , fixing Colby with a patient gaze . " Nilch . Not a one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was right here in this room , had little to do with him , but he 'd wait to see what was on your mind . <p> Colby was big , Dale 's age but already thinning up top , losing definition around the middle . He looked , with his bearish , slow movements and distracted smile , like someone rehearsing for middle age . He wore chinos and Topsiders and striped button-down shirts-nowhere could Abby see a trace of the hellraiser Dale had described-and somehow looked all right in them . Comfortable . Abby liked Colby . She could see him at a tall counter in a white coat , behind him all these efficient and hopeful rows of bottles and boxes . People would come for advice , and he would know what to tell them . She liked talking with Colby . When he laughed his mouth opened wide , his eyes too , as if you 'd surprised him . He did n't act like what you said , whatever it was , you 'd already said before . He was settling into life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never would . He slipped the papers into a folder and wrestled with the string , then gave up and let it hang . <p> " Dude , " he said . Dale looked at him mildly , as if he 'd just mentioned there might be more rain , or suggested a beer after work . " Better make some . " When Dale continued his vacant stare , Colby said , " Plans . " He shook his head once , as if he felt he should not have been brought to say this , which was essentially the way Abby felt about it . She gave a quick smile as he passed , but he was n't looking . He walked to the kitchen door and closed it behind him . <p> They sat at the table . Dale had his face inclined like someone pausing ; listening for something . They heard Colby get in his car and drive off . They heard the gears shift as the car moved up the street , then a soft rushing sound , wind in the trees , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those moments , she realized , when people talked , cleared the air . When people decided what to do . They were together , she and Dale , and they needed to figure out what was next . There was an opportunity here , if they knew how to use it . <p> Dale took the last piece of toast , swabbed it in the marmalade jar , chewed slowly . He did n't look at her . When he was finished he took his plate and stacked it on Abby 's , put the toast plate on top . He gathered the mugs and spoons and salsa and butter and marmalade and carried everything to the sink . He stood there a moment , his back to her , arms on the counter , deciding something . She could see the muscles in his shoulders and neck , saw them flex and relax . Then , certain she was watching , he selected a plate , held it straight out to his side , and let it shatter on the floor . <p> It was raining , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abby had never seen rain like this , warm , for one thing , and relentless . It seemed to slacken only to gather strength to start again , pulsed like something alive , like it would never stop . The whole town was flooded , maybe the whole state by now . They 'd watched the news at Colby 's , levees giving way , people plucked off rooftops and out of trees . Farther north they were airlifting cattle , dropping food from helicopters , like into a war zone . <p> They 'd gotten out of Colby 's house . After she 'd cleaned the kitchen , Dale had wanted to pack up and head out right then , and when she asked him where , where they would head out to , he obviously did n't know , and she tried to calm him , told him Colby had n't meant for them to leave immediately , that was n't what he was saying . She knew , of course , Colby would n't mind it , and Melissa would be delighted , but she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to drive three or four days , washing in rest stops where everyone could see , where they did n't even have mirrors anymore , just scratched pieces of metal that reflected nothing but dirty light . She did n't want to show up after midnight at someone else 's house , more sleepy , confused faces in which Dale would read only welcome , another basement , another pull-out or garage , needing to be cheerful all the time , trying to help with the cooking or groceries or laundry just to keep everyone friendly . She was tired . She did n't want to make another move . <p> She had found this park one day out walking . It was a pretty place , rolling lawns with big trees and a funky old locomotive for kids to climb on , a rose garden . She had wandered through , noting the funny names of the roses : Hoagy Carmichael , Livin ' Easy , Sexy Rexy , Brigadoon . She liked the neatly laid-out rows , the tidy raised beds , the plants with their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of arbor , on a bench with a plaque on it , vines with delicate new leaves trailing through the wood . She looked out and imagined herself living in this town , coming here on weekends , maybe during lunch hour with friends , bringing a book , walking under the trees . In time , she imagined , this would become her park , the way you could say My park , My town , when people and places grew attached to one another . <p> What she saw today shocked her , thrilled her a little . Even with all the stuff on the news , she had n't realized it could be this bad . More than half the park was underwater . The river , which she had n't even known was there , now rushed beyond its banks , an oily brown flume carrying sticks , logs , all kinds of junk . The locomotive was stranded on its hill , and the wooden sign with the park 's name was almost invisible , the top of its yellow lettering lapping in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking around for the rose garden , when she realized it too was submerged , only the few farthest rows poking through . The arbor where she 'd sat was way out now , like a floating dock in a fouled lake . <p> Abby tried telling Dale how amazing all this was-she was here what , three days ago ? it was like an entirely different world-but Dale was n't listening , had n't uttered a word since they 'd left Colby 's . At the water 's edge they watched a section of fence carried downriver , a lawn chair , then a whole tree , leaves still attached . Somewhere a dog was barking , and for a moment Abby had the crazy notion it was trapped in the branches , but the barking continued after the tree had floated past . <p> When Dale pulled out his pouch and started rolling she really was n't interested , but she smoked anyway . And when a few minutes later , still not saying a word , he led her by the hand to one of the wooden picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not have been less in the mood . He kissed her neck , helped her out of her sweater and T-shirt . Even when they were n't speaking he was tender and slow with her-his way of communicating , of making up . Dale 's favored pleasure was doing it outside , doing it naked outside , anyplace with a view or designated for some other purpose , domestic or municipal . They had done it in people 's yards , on golf courses at night , on the Catalina ferry . Once , Dale learned about a small zoo in a city park : After midnight they climbed the fence and did it there , in the weird smells and stillness , Abby on her back before a cage of mute , bedraggled peacocks that made startled movements and stared at her with glittering , expressionless black eyes . <p> Now he was moving over her , watching her , touching her with his lips and hands , and she adjusted herself on the table under him . Through the dull hum of the dope she felt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself say his name . But her eyes remained open , and she watched the locomotive , " Georgia Pacific " and " 650 " on its rusted flank , and beyond it the shifting , unsettled sky , depthless and gray . <p> During their sex , when Dale was holding himself back , slowing so she could take her time , Abby heard noises . A truck and two cars drove in at the far end of the park . Dale noticed them , too . He moved more urgently , looking across at several figures walking . He grinned happily , up on his arms to see , his yin/yang medallion swaying on its string to his movements . When they were finished he stroked her hair and kissed the top of her head . He reached for the pouch on the bench , and she left him there , stretching , naked on the table , rooting happily around for the half-smoked joint . <p> On her way back from the washroom she took the longer route , near the flooded area , past a swingset and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another thirty yards and the water would reach it , too . She wondered if it would float . The rain was picking up now , but she was pretty well soaked already , and the pot offered its customary hovering sensation , vacant , warm , and she did n't mind the wet . She was curious about the people standing by the truck , but they did n't seem to be doing much , so she walked on . She had no forethought of what she might do when she passed the car at the end of the lot , saw the purse and shopping bag on the seat , the door buttons raised . If anything , she reflected later , she was on some kind of autopilot , her mind entirely empty , as if it had been wiped clean . She simply opened the door and got in . <p> She tried out the steering wheel , looked through the glove compartment and purse . The keys were right there . She found a pack of gum in her jeans , ate the last piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if this were her car and she had sat here many times , was just sitting here now until she decided where to go . <p> When she got out she looked at the people , a woman and two men by the truck , two more women farther off . She thought someone might glance over and see her , and her hands were full anyway , so she walked off without closing the door , risking the sound it might make . <p> The gum wrapper was clown colors , pink and yellow and green , with balloon lettering . Bubblicious , she read . The ultimate bubble . When Roberta brought it to her nose she could smell the tangy , overpowering sweetness of artificial strawberry . She had thought the police might want it for evidence , for fingerprints maybe , when she 'd taken it from the floor of her car . But the sergeant said that would n't be necessary , and she had placed it on the table between their coffee cups , where it was now . <p> The sergeant 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had been in Cheryl 's grade . She tried to think back , pare the rough  --  shaven , age-thickened man to reconstruct the boy he must have been . He had had something of a crush on Cheryl , he was telling her as she tried to locate a face she could recognize in his . He had wanted to ask her out all through high school , never did get the nerve . Silly , huh ? He smiled kindly . He hoped he had n't upset her by talking about it . <p> No , Roberta said . No , no . Not at all . <p> She did n't remember him . He could n't have been in Cheryl 's grade , anyway ; he must be mistaken . There was a dusting of gray in his short hair , and his eyes , friendly , tired , were not the eyes of a young man . <p> She was making a list of what was taken , everything she could remember . On a pad she wrote " Sweater , blue , " adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might help . She wrote " Groceries . " Did he want to know what groceries ? Sergeant Simkins said that would n't be necessary . " Cash , " Roberta continued , " $35 , approximately . " She looked up again . It could have been twenty-five , or less ; she really did n't remember . But Sergeant Simkins was bouncing his black uniform hat off a knee , maybe humming a tune silently , and she did n't bring it up . She continued her list . " Checkbook . Insurance cards : medical , auto . Others : Shell , Costco , Bi-Mart , AARP . Driver 's license . Photos . " <p> When she reached " Credit Cards , " Sergeant Simkins said they would need the numbers , and he followed her into the den and offered to carry to the table the shoebox in which she kept the old receipts . There by the broad desk , the recliner with her stack of magazines and last night 's cup of tea on the side table , the spoon and teabag still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzy , a little lightheaded , maybe , momentarily confused , as if she 'd wandered by mistake into the wrong room . She was embarrassed that the teacup was still out , as if Sergeant Simkins , seeing it ( though it did n't seem he had ) , could also see her in her curlers and the worn chenille bathrobe she kept meaning to replace , the ridiculous but warm quilted booties she had bought last winter at the mall . <p> Maybe she was more upset than she 'd realized . She found the box in the bookshelf behind the desk and felt herself fixed by a vivid alternate scene , one she tried to shake off before she fully saw it . This boy , Simkins-Jeff , had he said , Josh ? - helping her with the bills , a routine they performed together every month , while from upstairs came sounds of footsteps , bathwater running , voices . Though she had n't planned to , she let Sergeant Simkins carry the box and followed him back to the kitchen . <p> She continued her list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had n't thought of that-of course , the locks would have to be changed . She 'd left the back door open this morning , as they had for years , but that too would be different now . Sergeant Simkins hung up the phone , said he would wait with her until the locksmith came . He sat back at the table and said there should n't be much trouble with the credit cards . Not to worry , this happened all the time . Yes , Roberta said . I suppose it must . <p> When the locksmith arrived , Sergeant Simkins went to open the door . She heard them talking about the flood ; the locksmith lived just a few blocks from the river . He 'd had a load of sand dumped in his yard  --  no sense not being prepared . <p> Roberta looked at the gum wrapper again , its antic color and smell , The paper was tacky , well-fingered , still wet . " Bubblicious , " she read aloud . The locksmith came in to say hello , laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back door . Roberta knew the man , recognized him from the Lock Doc . He greeted her by name . He 'd once , ironically , helped her get into her car when she had locked the keys inside by the post office . It was then , she realized now , that she started leaving the doors unlocked , as a precaution . <p> He and the sergeant chatted as he worked , and she offered him coffee , which he said he 'd take because all this wet sank into his bones , did she get that way ? He 'd take the coffee because it was hot , not because , God knew , he needed more caffeine . <p> Sergeant Simkins turned on the early news , all about the flooding , and Frank Potts-she remembered his name now-mentioned his brother-in-law , who farmed rye down toward Elmira , might lose his entire spring crop . He was an amiable man , Frank Potts ; he complimented her on the coffee twice ( it was just instant ) and assured her several times he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was true , Alone , she would have abandoned the kitchen for the den to flip through magazines and game shows . She enjoyed the two men in her kitchen , the steamy , close smells of wet clothing and work , the tuneless whistle Frank Potts took up from time to time , the way Sergeant Simkins slowly slumped in his chair , spreading his legs before him , then straightened when he caught her eye , as if he 'd been lax in professional courtesy . <p> She liked having them there , though watching Frank Potts on his knees by the door , the sleek brass cylinder of the new lock by his feet , she could n't shake the ridiculous feeling that what he was doing would prevent her getting out , not someone getting in . <p> She had , she told herself severely , to get a grip . <p> When Frank Potts was done he took her to both doors , had her try the locks , gave her two sets of keys-he 'd thought to make extras before he came-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in a white coat holding a stethoscope up to a door . After asking , both of them , if there was anything else they could do , and being assured there was n't , the men left together . Through the glass Roberta saw them stand there until she slid the bolt , then walk toward the curb and their cars . <p> Through the night , as she watched television in the kitchen and then in the den , as she ran a hot bath for the chill she 'd been distantly aware of all day , as she got into bed with her novel and tried , later , to close her eyes and sleep , Roberta waited . Nothing could be more absurd , she realized , even Sergeant Simkins had mentioned it-whoever did this , the last thing they would do now was look for more trouble . Do n't worry , he 'd said . They 're long gone . <p> This was n't like her , she scolded herself after she 'd read the same page a third time , these wild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? She would simply not think about it any longer , she informed herself , switched out the light , and assumed that would be that . But through the night she woke from time to time and found herself unable to follow her instructions . She lay with eyes open , not afraid , exactly , but alert , tensed with some dim presentiment , waiting for the familiar rasp of a key in the door . <p> All she 'd said was in high school , for a time , she 'd enjoyed taking pictures . She 'd gone down to a local ballet academy and hung around , snapped the little girls in formation , in tutus by the stretching bar , examining themselves seriously in the mirror . The town paper had run a few , and her mother had framed and hung them in the entryway downstairs , where guests would be asked to comment on them , while otherwise everyone , Abby included , forgot they existed . <p> Dale asked what she 'd always dreamed of having , and when she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Colby and Melissa . Then she remembered the clumsy , borrowed camera , the chubby eight- and nine-year-olds who 'd followed her around asking to look through it . She 'd gone to show them their pictures , and they had gathered , pointing each other out in the paper , looking at her with awed delight . One girl had said , " I did n't know you were a for real photographer . " In high school , she told Dale , I liked photography . That 's all it took . <p> She should have known what was coming next , after the dinner and cognac the night before . This is crazy , she whispered to Dale . Wo n't somebody catch on ? <p> They were being led down the aisles of Northwest Cameraworld by Shane , a clerk with buzzed lime hair and hoop earrings who claimed he 'd heard Gary Gilmore play . The store was wide and overlit , equipment posed high over the shelves like museum pieces to be admired . He thought it was Portland , Shane was saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Arcata , Dale informed him , smiling , meaning someone 's garage or back porch . Humboldt . Yeah , that was it , Shane replied , smiling too . Arcata . Or Humboldt . <p> Dale carried a large canvas bag that held a Nikon Autofocus , a flash with rechargeable battery pack , a 300 mm and wide-angle lens , a fifty  --  piece filter set , a soft leather case . Abby had begun calculating what all this would total but stopped around two thousand dollars . Now they were in the last aisle , and Shane was holding a tripod out for their perusal . <p> " Bogen , " he said . " Top of the line . You 'll need one of these for the 300 mm . " <p> " You 're right , " Dale said , twisting the black knobs , shooting out the adjustable legs . <p> " Feel the mechanism ? " Shane asked . <p> " Silky smooth , " Dale said , folding it under his arm , and they both grinned again . <p> Last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Abby wait until Melissa came home for an announcement . He 'd put on a CD , and from the brief wince Colby gave , Abby could tell it was too loud , but nobody said anything . Colby seemed embarrassed by the previous morning , glad to have the tension dissipated by whatever had turned Dale 's mood . When Melissa arrived , Dale greeted her at the door . He switched off the music . He opened two beers , one for Melissa and another for himself , and made his announcement . <p> Today , the gods had smiled . Fortune had done a backflip . Not only would he and Abby be vacating in a day or two-a nod with his beer bottle , thanks to the gracious hosts-but tonight , in celebration , they would seriously tie one on . But only-all charm now-if Melissa was n't too tired from work . <p> Melissa was clearly tired from work . She had taken the beer from Dale and come to sit on the couch . Abby watched her ease her feet from her shoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably at the news they would soon be leaving , and took a long pull off the bottle . <p> " Fuck it , " she said . " Just let me change . " <p> " Put on something nice , " Dale said , nodding happily . Colby watched Melissa go toward the bedroom , and Dale cocked a finger at him . " Only one thing I need from you , bub , " he said . " What 's the best restaurant in this burg ? " <p> At the Chalet they were seated by Heather , who looked uncomfortable in her tight skirt , tuxedo shirt , and tie , and who would , she informed them , be their server . By their table a fountain sprayed colored water at a stone cherub . The colors came from headlights in the water below , red , blue , and green , and around the cherub , whose arms were aloft , though one was minus a hand-where Abby figured Cupid 's bow and arrow had , until some recent misfortune , been held-were stone frogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stone ducklings , and , though it was on the far side and Abby could n't fully see , what appeared to be a blue-capped Tyrolean dwarf squatting hip-deep in the water . <p> She was transfixed . She was buzzed and dreamy from the dope and beer , and while everyone disappeared behind two-foot-tall menus , she stared at the fountain , wondering if she really had to go to the bathroom or if it was the sound of the water , wondering if wondering about this all night would ruin her meal . This could , she realized , be a long evening . <p> Heather brought what she called a relish tray-carrot sticks , olives and pickles and celery on a bed of ice-and a huge basket of steaming rolls , which Dale and Colby tore into , grinning conspiratorially . Boys , Abby thought . As if being high were a terrific secret , everyone just dying to know . <p> After his announcement , Dale had jump-started the evening by putting on Ziggy Marley and rolling a cigar-sized " Rasta bone . " They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance with him , Dale danced alone and they watched . He was a wonderful dancer , moved With closed eyes and an expression of sublime pleasure on his face . He looked the way everyone wanted to look-immersed , in the music , the moment , the sway and sensation of his own body . At clubs , people , and not only women , would just turn and start dancing with him . Passing the joint one time , Abby had to nudge Melissa to get her attention . <p> Heather recited the evening 's specials as they ate rolls slathered with butter . She mispronounced " scaloppini , " though for the life of her Abby could n't remember how it was supposed to be said . Dale was n't listening . He leaned over to Melissa and said , " Hey , hot pants . What 's that stuff they drink in France ? " <p> Heather stopped her recitation , brow furrowed , and hauled her short black skirt down over a finger-sized tear in her stocking . Abby , who 'd waitressed herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . At the same time Melissa said " Wine ? " Colby said " Water ? " and Heather , looking up and deciding , apparently , to be game , said " Champagne ? " <p> " No , no , no , " Dale said . " C'm on , you know , that fancy shit , what 's it called ? Corbustierre . " <p> " Courvoisier ? " Heather asked . " You mean the cognac ? " <p> " Yeah , that 's the shit , " Dale said . " You got any ? " <p> " That 's good stuff , " Melissa said , smiling at him . <p> " Sure , " Heather said , grinning , then remembering herself . " Certainly , sir . How many ? " <p> " Bring the bottle , " Dale told her . <p> This roused Colby , who had methodically made his way through the pickles and celery , was now finishing the carrots . He 'd offered the tray to Abby , who 'd bitten off a piece of gelid gherkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swallow . " Dude , " Colby said . " You 're whacked . " Dale just looked at him . " Dude , " Colby explained , holding a serrated carrot stick in the air as if in demonstration of his point . " In the liquor store that would set you back forty bucks . They 'll charge a hundred here . " <p> " More , I think , " Heather added . <p> Dale took in this information . " Heather , " he said . " Have you had Courvoisier yourself ? " <p> Heather smiled . " Yeah , " she admitted . " Coupla times . " <p> " Good , is n't it ? " Dale asked . <p> " Real good , " Heather said , smiling at all of them . " I like it with soda . " <p> Dale nodded . " Then , as our server , Heather , would you tell my friend the pharmacist here if you should put a price tag on quality ? On happiness , Heather ? " <p> Heather looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , man , " she said . " Grab it by the balls and shake it . " <p> Dale offered a buttered roll to Melissa . Colby started putting black olives onto the ends of his fingers . " Dude , " he said . " You 're whacked . " Heather brought the cognac , two bottles of red wine , and four prime ribs , " Table Cut , " which Dale had ordered for everyone . Abby 's was so big it overlapped the platter , sagging thickly to one side , a little pink-red runnel collecting by her water glass . She ate what she could , mostly vegetables and whipped potatoes , making a series of precise holes in her prime rib by pressing the tip of her fork into the meat . The holes filled immediately with fluid . Colby ate too quickly and sat back with half  --  closed eyes . Dale particularly loved the potatoes , and Melissa fed him some off her fork . <p> By the end of the meal Abby and Colby were throwing ice cubes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cognac , deep in some conversation Abby could n't hear . <p> Abby had drunk too much long ago . Cognac was good if you sipped it , but nobody was sipping tonight . She had actually gone into the ladies ' room at one point , having pushed away her tattooed meat , and stood over the toilet , giving her stomach opportunity to erupt . This had worked in college , and usually after vomiting she had been OK to go on drinking . But tonight nothing happened except after a few moments she noticed a tendril of spit in her hair . <p> At the table Dale and Melissa were still talking , and she had her hand on his arm , where he had a pale scar , half an inch long . When they met , Abby had noticed it , and Dale referred ominously to a dangerous childhood , tough times on the streets in L.A. Later , apparently forgetting this , he told her it was a chicken-pox scar that had abscessed when he 'd scratched it , hoping to miss a science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain it twice , he told her . Hurt like a motherfucker . <p> Now Melissa was touching it with a fingertip and looking at Dale as Dale stared down her V-neck . Melissa was slim and toned and had outsize Maria Shriver hair that never moved . She said something and shivered and brought her shoulders together . Maybe she was cold , Abby thought . She felt a nudge on her arm and looked up to see Colby grinning , his hair pushed back over a green smudge . In his hand was a little stone duck . She looked at the fountain and saw a vacant spot in the procession , third in line from the mother . Colby winked and slid the duck into her jacket pocket . <p> When Heather brought the bill , Dale pushed it across the table at Abby . " Thanks for a fine meal , " he told Heather . " And Roberta , " he said , " do n't forget our server . " <p> Abby had to look at the card twice to remember what to sign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the fountain again . Heather walked over , tugging something under her frilled white blouse . " You believe it ? " she said . " Some frat boy broke his harp . His little hand , too . " She looked at Abby , pouting , batting her eyes as if about to cry , and Abby followed the others out to the car . <p> She ended up in the back with Colby , and they both dropped immediately to sleep . When she awoke they were in Colby and Melissa 's driveway , Colby heavily asleep against her , the front seat empty , no lights on in the house . She was getting cold . She tried to rouse Colby but could n't get him to respond , so she tried , at least , for a more comfortable position . Something jabbed her ribs . She held Colby off and squirmed until she could reach into her pocket and pull out the little stone duck . <p> At the counter of Northwest Cameraworld , Shane was totaling the bill . The sum , nearly three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was softly drumming from the night before . " This is crazy , " she whispered to Dale . " Wo n't somebody catch on ? " Dale just handed her a pen . She made out the check , not thinking , then realized she 'd written her own first name . She looked up in alarm , but Dale said , " Just cross it out " ; Shane had busied himself bagging their purchases . Abby crossed out her name , wrote , in what was left of the space , Roberta Munson , let Shane tear off the receipt and hand it to her . Outside , the light was glary off the clouds . The sun hurt her eyes . As she waited for Dale to hail a cab , she said , " He knew , did n't he ? " and Dale held the door open for her and , as she got in , kissed the top of her head . <p> The police station , in a converted church , was newly appointed , walls blue-green , ceiling a textured white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed , to be upbeat , suppress the impression of civic thrift they somehow only heightened . She had n't been in here for years , thought she preferred the old decor , the battered wooden desks and gooseneck lamps , the walls covered with paper . It had been comforting , she realized , even if it was only an illusion , the feeling the police were too busy trying to help people to care how the place looked . <p> The chairs were new as well , industrial-grade tweed , with crisp magazines on side tables , and the wall opposite held photographs of ex  --  policemen and - women , a mute chronology through the years . Some had small black ribbons below them . Roberta did n't know where to look . The receptionist was young and friendly , had greeted her with a welcoming smile , like a stewardess on a plane . She wore one of those new telephone headsets that wrapped around your face . Roberta could see no cord attached to it . When she answered the phone she moved things on her desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while talking . It was unnerving . <p> Beyond the hall was a large room Roberta could see into , people bustling about , boxes being moved . Two boys burst into the waiting area . The receptionist , instantly transformed , snapped her fingers twice and pointed at the room they had come from . They shuffled back together , trying to step on each other 's feet . " Quit it , Henry ! " one said as they shouldered into the room , where they immediately began running again . When Roberta looked around , Sergeant Simkins was standing beside her . <p> He led her into a conference room off the main hall , had her stand before a counter of drink supplies-freshly brewing coffee , colorful packets of herbal and regular tea , cider , hot chocolate . When she hesitated he asked if she would like a pop instead and reached toward a small refrigerator below the counter . Roberta took a packet of tea without looking and filled a paper cup with hot water from the urn . She sat at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding sugar , sweetener , a plastic bear full of honey . <p> He watched her dip the tea bag into her cup twice , lay it on the saucer he had provided . She looked at the various sweeteners until he said , " New policy . More people-friendly . " <p> " I really do n't want any tea , " Roberta said . <p> " I 'm sorry , " he said . " We 're supposed to offer . " <p> He smiled , and Roberta felt ungracious and took a sip , some minty flavor that reminded her of the dentist . Behind Sergeant Simkins 's head was a poster of a smiling woman in uniform holding up her hand while a group of children crossed a street . Roberta opened her handbag and produced some papers . " I got these , " she said . <p> Sergeant Simkins examined them one by one . Xeroxes of canceled checks she 'd received from her bank : a music store in Portland , a Nordstrom 's in Salem , a camera shop here in town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberta recalled ever having in her account . On one signature line was the word Abby , visible through hasty scratches , over her own name , in a hand so foreignslanted , juvenile , while her own was flowing , rounded , a source of small pride since grade school-that somehow she was affronted that even strangers could n't tell it was forged . The last statement was from her credit-card company-three thousand dollars more on hotels , dinners , ski equipment , some kind of European spa . So far she had only been charged fifty dollars , by the card company . But she worried there would be more charges , and dealing with these people , all suspicious at first , then , when they agreed it was unlikely a sixty-year-old widow of sparse habits would be all of a sudden buying ski equipment then stopping at a health spa a hundred miles from home , officious , condescending-if they could n't blame her for being a spendthrift , they could at least blame her for lack of oversight , responsibility-as if she 'd allowed this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sniffy young man had told her , was the property of the issuing financial institution . She could read it on the back . Next time she had one . <p> Sergeant Simkins looked at each paper carefully , lifting them and putting them down when he was done . He folded his hands on the table . <p> " How have you been ? " he asked . <p> The question startled Roberta . She had been preparing to tell him of her troubles with the bank , the rude and insinuating people on the phone . It would take a week to get new checks , unless she wanted to open an account without Ben 's name on it , the first time in forty years . One storeowner had demanded her social security number . Did she think stores like his , barely getting by , were there to be swindled ? Did she have any idea how hard it was to make an honest living these days ? The man had an accent , so slight she could n't place it , and he had actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had not known what to say , had finally apologized and hung up . Since then she had been reluctant to answer the phone . <p> Now , surprised to hear herself say it , she told Sergeant Simkins , " I 've been having trouble sleeping . " <p> He nodded . " That 's not unusual . " <p> She nodded in response , hoping to look reassured , which she was n't . Not unusual for whom-people who 'd had their purses stolen , people her age , nervous types in general ? And anyway it was unusual , for her , was n't that the point ? It seemed lately everyone understood her better than she did herself . She 'd made the mistake of telling LuAnne , who had assumed she 'd be terrified to ever again walk outside , and who had told Frances , who suggested she get a gun . At the Fred Meyer-how did they know about it ? - the manager had insisted on carrying her groceries to the car . Everyone trying to help . She almost opened her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people-friendly opinion , but he was waiting patiently , and instead she forced down another sip of the perfumed tea . She did n't understand why she had brought it up to begin with . <p> " Are the locks working OK ? " he asked . <p> She was still put out . " The one in the kitchen sticks a little . " <p> " Call Frank . He 'd be glad to stop by . " <p> They sat there , and she waited for him to say more . She had the feeling he was , as she had felt in her kitchen , waiting to be excused , too wellbred to tell her so . <p> " Has there been any progress ? " she said , turning the warm cup in her hands . " In my case . " <p> " The bank 's been notified , " he said quietly , " the credit companies . They have their own fraud divisions , did you know that ? They do their own investigating . " He looked as if he expected her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Munson , " and he indicated the papers again , " the profile we 're working with here is probably an organized gang , some bunch of kids who do this for a living . They walk off with your luggage at the airport , snatch your purse in the elevator at the mall . Just kids . It 's upsetting to the victims , we know . But unfortunately this type of ... of event is all too common nowadays . Which is why , at least , your liability is limited . " <p> She nodded again . <p> " These people should be stopped . They 're a nuisance , and God knows what else they 're up to in their spare time , between you and me . But they 're basically impossible to find . The insurance companies , they could find them if they wanted , they 've got the staff , but they 're dealing with fraud on a scale you and I could n't begin to imagine . It 's cheaper to just write stuff like this off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissing them , and Roberta resolved not to say any more . She had thought they might help , might give the police some kind of lead-there was a name , after all , in those blocky , preadolescent letters : Abby . Would n't that mean something ? But now she felt foolish and needy , bundling her woes downtown to be consoled by strangers , still , a week later , stalled by something she clearly should have left behind . <p> " I know it 's upsetting , " the sergeant was saying , leaning a bit over the table , smiling , simply making conversation now . Again Roberta noticed the flecking of gray in his hair , the scatter of small lines about the eyes . " Heck , my radio was stolen once . You should have seen me eyeing every kid on the street , looking for my $150 Alpine radio-cassette . " He shook his head . Were n't we all just a little foolish , his kind expression said , and vulnerable , and did n't you just have to give things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand through his hair . He was exhausted , she suddenly saw . The past few weeks had been hard for everyone . Perhaps because she had decided not to say any more , Roberta realized what she had come here to tell him , realized she barely knew the man , wondered at her sense , which really did seem lately to be tottering . <p> It was n't the money-he was right , that had been the least of it . And she could n't honestly say she was afraid for her safety , not after the first night or so . She could hardly claim that was the issue . It was something she could n't put a finger on , articulate even to herself , which was why , ridiculous as it was to realize , she had come in today , hoping this Simkins boy might help her discover what it was . There was a shifting , a slippage inside her , something happening she could n't understand , the way she felt the day before the flu hit , the way she used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was different . Someone out there is using my name , she wanted to tell the sergeant . <p> But she did n't say it , got up instead and thanked him , and when he rose , followed him to the door . <p> In the reception area there was more shuttling in and out of the room to the side , where Roberta now saw food and clothing were being distributed to people displaced by the flood . A woman with slack , unwashed blond hair holding a child by the hand-Roberta recognized one of the running boys-came over and spoke to Sergeant Simkins . There was something familiar about her , the way she stood holding the boy as he twisted around her , bored , from one side to the other , do n't you ? From CV High ? We were all in there together , Cheryl , Sandy , and me . " <p> Roberta looked closer and recognized the woman . She was from the TV the other day , the one pushing the Safeway cart over the bridge into town . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is Henry , my oldest . Henry , say hello . " The boy , suddenly shy , disappeared behind his mother , was visible now only by a small hand encircling her waist . <p> " Why , yes , " Roberta said . " Hello . " She knew she should say something , knew she should try , as she had when Sergeant Simkins sat in her kitchen , to locate this woman in her memory banks . Odd , how she could n't remember any of them . But more , she should feel something  --  this woman and her family had been forced from their home . Everything they owned , perhaps , was in black garbage bags , borrowed grocery carts . She had to bring her children to the police for food and clothing ; God knows where they had to sleep . A cot , in the school gymnasium , which Roberta had visited when she donated the clothing , maybe just blankets on the floor . <p> She looked from the woman to the boy , now peering at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was making as if to reach out and grab him . The boy squealed , hid his head , then darted it out , delighted . " Henry , " the woman said quietly . <p> Roberta smiled , waiting for words to form-something kind , surely she could offer that much-something about the boy , maybe . But instead what she saw in the woman 's face made her turn and lunge for the exit , nearly falling , somebody calling after her . She got both hands on the heavy glass and pushed , needing only , desperately , to get out . <p> Sympathy . Polite , deferential sorrow . This homeless bedraggled woman who had n't seen the inside of her home for days was looking at Roberta with pity in her tired eyes . Before she could move to her car , Roberta had to wait at the top of the stairs , dizzy , as if she 'd been holding her breath , her hand on the railing , greedily swallowing the cold morning air . <p> It was a joke to Dale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberta . Mr. and Mrs. Munson . He had had to say it , she supposed , at stores and restaurants when she signed the bill . Reminding her . Time to pay , Roberta dear . When they stayed at that place on Mount Hood she 'd given the woman behind the desk the Visa , but she came back looking embarrassed and said it was n't approved . Did she have another card ? Abby stood there a moment feeling some odd release , something like relief-this was what she 'd been waiting for . The woody lobby with the stone fireplace , the Mission furniture and tiered animal heads . The expensive people quietly talking , looking like they lived here all the time . The woman behind the desk , neat , professionally friendly , sorry for what would happen next , however necessary it was , hoping for little commotion . Whatever Abby said now would make it happen , someone , maybe that man on the phone , coming up behind her . She could almost feel his hand on her arm , her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , but Dale leaned forward on the high counter , smiling , and took the card , " You 're kidding me , " he said . " Must have topped it out at dinner last night , huh , sweetie ? " He looked at the card front and back , a **26;1681;TOOLONG ? expression on his , face , and slipped it into his pocket . " Roberta , why do n't we write them a check ? " Then back at the woman , " That would be OK , would n't it ? " and there was a hand on her arm , Dale 's , guiding her purse gently off her shoulder so she could get at the checkbook inside . <p> With Dale there was no point in direct questions . She 'd learned this already . Whatever was in the air was anticipated by Dale , owned by him somehow , and your bringing it up only made you look obvious , dull and unaware . That something had changed was plain , but nothing she could point at incontrovertibly and say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sleeping with Melissa was less plain , though that also seemed to be happening , and figuring out how they managed , when they found the time  --  near morning when Abby finally slept , middle-of-the-day trysts at some motel , that shed in the city park , could be anywhere , anytime-was n't that part of the attraction ? All the planning and finagling , the rehearsed stories and coded glances , the small , thrilling deceits-it all just made Abby 's head swim with weariness . She was n't even sure she cared . No , that was n't it ; she cared but was n't sure why , or she cared but was unsure about what . What would happen would happen . <p> She took the camera and shot pictures all over town : the WPA post office with the eagle over the door , the billowing stacks of the mill across the river . Farmers in for late breakfasts at the diner , kids outside the Greyhound station smoking cigarettes , trying to look dangerous . Traffic . Trees . Mailboxes . Eight rolls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hardware window , dining-room suites and ceramic dogs in the furniture store , paint and clothing and stationery , banks and computers and shoe repair . She walked until she was tired or ran out of film . She spent a morning photographing what floated by in the flood-the rain had let up , the sky was a steely , unmoving gray , but the water remained high . She snapped a bicycle helmet , a yellow tarp , a patch of sod upright with grass and dandelions on top . A gray shovel , slowly turning . Using the zoom in the park , she shot the old ladies digging up rosebushes , unsteadily guiding a wheelbarrow between the rows . She might even have offered to help , she really had nothing better to do , if she were n't afraid of being recognized . She came back in the mornings , before anyone was there , stretched out on the bench under the arbor , pulling her hat down to stay warm , and looked up at the oaks and firs , listening for birds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ate downtown or on the Ninth Street strip and everywhere paid by check . She signed the name slowly , handed over the check and waited , but all she ever got was ignored , or polite , unseeing smiles . No one asked for ID , and she stopped expecting them to , left the wallet at home . <p> Dale had warned her to be careful of the checks-they were running out , and she should n't waste them on piddly shit and should n't be writing any in this town anyway . Was n't that obvious ? What the hell was she thinking ? She ignored him , paid $1.29 at the Dairy Queen , $9.00 for film at Fred Meyer , 14.20 for coffee and a scone at the cart by the library . She would tear out the check , feel the diminishing pad with satisfaction . <p> They had n't moved out after all . They 'd bought a hammock for Colby and Melissa , striped green canvas on its own metal sling , big enough for four , Dale said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbing onto the sides as they swung wildly . Colby was back to his usual self , as Dale had described it . He was going late to class ; often he and Dale would have a beer or two for breakfast . He had some connection at school for coke , hospital grade , ENT-quality , and he took a mirror off the wall to chop it into lines . Melissa had loosened up too , came out of the shower after work in jeans and sweaters , hair brushed and sprayed , and they all got high and stayed up watching Comedy Central , laughing until they choked , and Abby would fade eventually and wake up on the couch under a blanket someone had laid over her . <p> They called her Roberta now ; it was the big joke . They ate Roberta 's steaks , drank Roberta 's beer , watched Roberta 's twenty-seven  --  inch Sony . First it was just Dale , Come sit over here , Mrs. Munson , then Melissa picked up on it , Thanks for the dinner , Roberta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mean anything by it , Morning , Roberta , are there any eggs ? <p> Dale took to calling her that in bed , some stupid game . Hold on , Roberta , I 'm coming . He asked her one night to wear the blue sweater , and she was too tired to tell him how stupid that was so she did it , and she wore it to bed most nights after that , without him having to ask , its fussy little buttons and tight crocheted sleeves . She did n't care . It was warm . <p> Their sex was regular as always , and Dale was proud of that , she could tell . He was n't one to deprive a woman of her due pleasure . He still hovered over her , moving languorously from the hips , watching with relaxed attention for her to signal the final rush to the finish line , which she did sooner than ever , surprised she could fool him into believing it was real . He still smoked and looked at the ceiling , but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time getting to sleep-maybe he was waiting for her to drop off . She did n't care . In her head she was elsewhere-that was all that mattered-looking back on all this as a story that spoke of youth and folly and unserious misadventure , a story she could laugh at , when it would be good again , in memory . <p> Two days without rain . The waters in the garden had finally receded , leaving the far beds probably unhurt . Those nearer the river were buried deep in silt , and the closest had disappeared entirely , swept away in the current . The river , which Roberta could no longer see from the park , was still near flood stage , the trees lining the bank carrying a lunatic display of shoes , blankets , plastic bags , tattered remains you could n't begin to identify . <p> LuAnne and Frances had gone to arrange the delivery of new plants . Frances had been on the phone to Portland , whose terraced garden was on higher ground , discussing the donation of a few rarer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topsoil and wood chips and steaming fertilizer , and for the first time since the rains began Roberta had mud on her knees and arms , the pleasant stiffness in her back and shoulders that would spread overnight into a full-body ache she secretly enjoyed . Her hat was pushed back , her spare gloves , for when these got too wet , ready by her feet . She crawled around the muddied plants , pulling away debris , checking root structure , replacing missing signs . Order was returning to the garden , rows and beds regaining definition , brush and scraps piled neatly by the road , only the section where the flood had been deepest still boggy , a wet grime over everything , thick shapes suggesting what was left of the plants below . <p> After two hours she was tired . It was warmer today . LuAnne and Frances should have come back by now , and without their bickering the sleepy rhythm of working the plants , along with her late inability to rest , lulled Roberta , the softened breeze carrying hints of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had n't been out to Cheryl 's pergola yet . The waters had surrounded it , but it was on the highest patch of ground , near the grove of firs , and except for a thatching of leaves and sticks across the lower staves , everything seemed intact , in need only of some cleaning . <p> Above her the sky was slowly churning , clouds tinged yellow and pink , a promise of sun . Someone had brushed off the bench , apparently , and the plaque with the verse looked buffed also , though maybe brass did n't tarnish the way she had assumed . Here was something new , Roberta thought as she folded the gloves into her hat and tucked them at one end of the bench for her head . What would Ben say , coming upon : her sprawled out , napping in a public park ? Who knew ? Maybe he 'd just enjoy it , the sight of her resting in the sun . <p> It was the sun warming her face , or the uncomfortable way her legs angled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lying down outside in the middle of the day , or simply her ruined sleep patterns . Whatever it was , Roberta was n't certain if she was dreaming , or remembering , or if she had risen from the bench and walked away . <p> It was winter now , night , heavy snow freshly fallen , more than a foot by the looks of it , bending trees and reducing everything to soft , indistinct outline . She was walking with Cheryl , somehow they had gotten onto this road , they were cold , the lights of their town were n't visible yet . Roberta scolded herself harshly-this was inexcusable . She held Cheryl 's hand tight , the palm and chilled fingers . She had n't even made sure the girl was wearing mittens before they left , proper shoes . <p> On the road , parked cars waiting out the storm , some just pulled to the side , within inches as they passed , others strayed far into the white fields ; she could see their lights . People smoking , keeping warm under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclined more deeply , something still and sunken in their immobility that caused Roberta to hurry past before Cheryl could see . <p> She would make it up to her at home , a bath , something warm to drink , a snack , whatever Cheryl wanted-egg-in-a-hat , maybe , her favorite-before bed . Roberta would be alert for signs of a cold , chills , fever . Then sleep , tomorrow school . <p> Roberta could n't understand where their car was , how she had let them end up like this , outside town in the middle of a storm , on a darkly lit and unfamiliar road . It made her angry . Cheryl veered too near one car , and Roberta pulled her closer . This was inexcusable , she told herself again . Unforgivable . She would get them home , out of this weather , and have a long reckoning with herself . Cheryl was tired , forgetting to lift her shoes , her footing loose in the snow . " Careful , " Roberta said , clutching her hand . " Careful , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because she was sitting upright on a bench in the city park , her hat in the dirt , tears streaming through her fingers onto her face . She heard her name , looked over to see Frances and LuAnne unloading plants from a truck and turned away so they would n't see her . <p> It was too sudden . So much of it was simply that . Too sudden and permanent and absolute ; there was n't any way to react . Everything changed , all at once , all that was to come and all that had been before , everything , in one freezing blast . <p> The children had done the right things , the police assured them , as if it would be a solace . They had n't been drinking or driving too fast , it had n't been late , and they were already on their way home . The boy , Brad , who had worried Roberta , with his slow smile and thick fringe of hair , had n't done anything wrong . Black ice . You could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare . They 'd left the road and hit the tree without so much as braking . There could n't have been much time , they said , meaning suffering , or surprise , or fear . <p> It had changed Ben . He pored nightly over pictures and yearbooks , stopped her friends on the street to exchange , verify memories , ask how they were getting on in their sports teams and clubs , their college applications . He dragged out the Hebrew prayer books he had inherited from his father ; early mornings she would find him in a skullcap he had gotten someplace , muttering the foreign words . She was amazed he could still read the language . A few times she woke to see the bathroom light on , hear him in there , weeping . <p> It was all they could do together now , mourn , and when she could n't join him , not that way , living it , tending it , nurturing and caressing it , every minute of the day , as if loss were their new child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could n't explain , and Ben had gently , ruefully , as was his manner , pulled away . He had contacted Frances Halliwell about a memorial , joined the Rose Society , prodded Roberta to come along Sunday mornings until she acquiesced . He had sent for the bench from a catalog company in Maine , built the arching wooden pergola himself , slowly , over the rest of the winter , found the verse for the plaque in one of his father 's books . Hours they had spent clearing the land , tilling the soil , fertilizing , preparing it for the roses . In the spring , when the plants were put in , a small ceremony . Ben read the verse in Hebrew and then in English . Like a rose among the thorns , So is my love among the daughters . He cried freely and blindly took her hand . Within six months , he too was gone . <p> Like any mother , Roberta had planned for the future and mutely , with helpless remorse , dreaded it . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't careful she could at any minute make the irrevocable slide to a place where everything was measured by what had been and passed . She fought it . She encouraged her daughter toward independence , applauded when she no longer needed help dressing or bathing or tending her body 's needs . When Cheryl broke an elbow one summer at camp Ben had wanted to drive there and bring her home immediately , but Roberta had talked to the girl on the phone , asked her to think of what she really needed to do . When Cheryl , stopping her tears , said Stay at camp , make the most of this opportunity , Roberta had nearly wept with pride . She told Cheryl she loved her and assured Ben she would be fine . <p> Life-and Roberta had always understood this when others had not  --  was a bracing , a sustained vigil against the inevitable . Ben , for all his patience and attentiveness , had never known this . For sixty years life crept up and took him by surprise . And this was why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reserved her admiration for strident and willful Frances , for her skeptical and anticipatory toughness . <p> Which was also why this crisis had been insurmountable to Roberta , crushing . She had prepared . There would be the teenage years , of course , the gradual pulling away into a world of friends and gossip , nights out , boys . Then college , out of state , probably , interests and areas of knowledge Roberta would be unable to talk to her about . Jobs then , marriage , a career that could land her anywhere . Grandchildren , if Roberta was lucky-a weak , piercing pleasure of expectancy here . What unreserved , even silly , love she would shower on these children ; it would not be her job to make them strong-being satisfied with a visit or two a year , holidays grown even more precious as they gathered for rare celebrations . Life extended before Roberta , if ever-diminishing , then tolerable in its consolations . It was a bargain she could accept . <p> She wiped her face with her hat , pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances a quick wave to indicate she was coming . <p> It was supposed to give you time . That was all she had ever asked , all , even , she had ever expected . Time , some notice , to cushion the blow , brace for it , arrange whatever had to be done . <p> The hard part , what she had prepared for , was missing her daughter . Accepting Cheryl was out there somewhere living her life . This was what she could n't say to Ben when he waited with shattered dismay for them to come together after Cheryl 's death . Do this , he had said to her . Do this with me . But she could n't , not even for him . It took every ounce of strength simply to hold on . Turn aside , lose concentration , let him or anyone in to share her isolate , perfect grief , and she would topple , never stop falling . <p> What she had prepared for was missing her daughter . That would be the hard part . What she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not for a moment allowing herself to . <p> There was one check left . Abby needed an appropriate send-off for it , the last of the bunch . She found a pack of gum at the Circle K for seventy-nine cents , made the check out , and handed it to the bored college kid with headphones on , who shoved it in the register without looking . <p> She was leaving . She had n't been sure until this morning , and she had no idea where to go . Arcata , maybe , Calypso and Max , that waitressing job . A lot was undecided-everything , really-but she was leaving , that much was clear , that much felt right . <p> She used the pay phone by the door to call home , saying out loud even as she dialed the numbers not to do this to herself . <p> Her mother answered between the first and second rings , as Abby debated whether to hang up . Abby heard the toneless chatter of the television , then two breathy explosions from the espresso machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talking to her mother was like entering one of those TV shows from when Abby was a kid , when a line down the center of the screen would allow you to see Valerie Bertinelli , say , talking with her boyfriend on the phone , both sides visible . Abby could see herself , in a drafty convenience store in the seeping Northwest , and she could see , as if it were right there before her , her mother 's gleaming kitchen twelve hundred miles south , its terra cotta and copper and earth tones , its handmade Mexican tiling , at forty dollars a square , its sun-bathed garden and view of the hills . She could see her mother in front of the TV , inclined over a decaf cappuccino , her beautiful , brimming face gleaming sadness and longing at the heart-rent souls on Maury or Sally or Montel . She would do what she could , always did , if it meant organizing a drive or making a donation or starting a letter-writing campaign among her friends . <p> " It 's me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Abby , dear , " her mother said . " Just spilled some coffee , clumsy me . You sound close , around the corner . How are you , dear ? Tell me how you are . " <p> " I 'm OK , Mother . How 's Dad ? " <p> " He 's fine , dear . Wait one moment , let me shut this off . He misses you dreadfully , of course . And I do , also , needless to say . Dreadfully . But I have n't forgotten . " Abby could see her holding up a hand . " We 've agreed not to discuss it . I have n't forgotten . " <p> Abby had long ago given up the dissection of her mother 's bright inflection and airy , distracted charm , trying to decipher what might be under the carefree tone , the heedless , off-center enthusiasms- " That hat ! " Abby could still hear her saying . " Abby , you must be thrilled ! " It was too painful-it was a reason she no longer called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother not to ask where she was , when she might be coming home , had said she would never call again if her mother kept asking , still-and this was perverse , unfair-she could n't help but bite her lip at the way her mother cheerfully undertook to maintain the bargain , as good as her word , even as Abby knew , and was hurt by knowing , she would sit later in somebody 's kitchen and cry . <p> To save them both , Abby asked a few quick questions . Soon her mother was chatting amiably-as if they talked twice a day-about her father 's sciatica ( better , most days ) , his firm ( politics , politics ) , her ongoing renovation of the downstairs ( do n't get her started ) . Did Abby remember Gail Nordhouse ? Tall , squinchy girl , terrible skin ? She had married , no one could believe it , an Arab , at least her father 's age , fabulously wealthy . She was off to Bahrain now . Or was it Beirut ? <p> Abby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kitchen or den or living room or garage . Everything , from the soap dish in the guest bathroom to the floral trim in the dining room , bespoke good taste , a serene and comely esthetic . No fuss , no obtrusive clutter or fine-art pretension . Just the feeling of sensible hard work , of someone giving thought to what others might never have noticed . There was devotion , in the remodeling and adjusting , in the colors that soothed , never clashed or called attention to themselves , in the selection of a display plate or statuette that would set off an entire corner just so . As her mother talked Abby walked through the house slowly , down to the cellar , up to her old room , her mother 's dressing room and shower . The house was a statement , an expression of what life could be-calm and pretty and earnestly filled with pleasure . Abby admired it , and her mother , who had made it . It was what she probably missed most , and why , obscurely , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom Abby had dated once , one of her " beaus , " as her mother called them , from high school . Just opened his own practice , downtown by the square . Even the old lawyers like her father had to admit he was doing excellent work , though some of the fusspots , threatened of course , would n't admit it , would begrudge Picasso a fountain pen . Just the other day Madeline Mancuso was saying ... <p> " Mother . " Abby interrupted her . " I need to get going . " <p> Her mother stopped short . " Yes . Yes , dear . Of course . " <p> Abby could hear the espresso machine starting up again . " It 's my job . I ca n't be late . " <p> " Of course , dear . That would n't do . " <p> " I 'll call again . OK ? Soon . " <p> " That would be wonderful . Maybe you could phone in the evening , or on the weekend . Your father would love to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Abby asked again . Her mother had a hand over the phone , did n't answer . " Maybe this weekend . I 'll call . " <p> " Saturday ? Sunday we 're at the club . We could stay home ; would that be easier ? Do you have the number at the club ? Hold on , let me get it for you . " <p> " Mom . I 'll call . " <p> Then silence and two rapid breaths , a signal to Abby . She could n't tell who hung up first . She hoped it was her mother . <p> The kid behind the counter still had n't moved , had n't looked at her . If it was n't for the tinny spatter of metal music from his headphones , to which he made odd grimaces with his mouth and chin , she might have thought he was asleep . She could walk out with half the store and he would n't flinch . Probably what he was waiting for , actually , day after day , that or a holdup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letting the door swing closed behind her , good luck . <p> As she left the Circle K she realized she had forgotten the reason she called home . Her name . She 'd meant to ask her mother . With all the jokes lately she 'd had it on her mind . Abby . Abigail . It was n't after anybody , far as she knew . She 'd meant to ask where they 'd come up with it ; that was why she had called . Or maybe it was n't . It was hard to say these days why she did anything she did . <p> Last night Dale wanted to talk . He 'd been gone from their bed a couple of hours-Abby had fallen asleep and not kept track-and when he came back he was talkative and affectionate and trying to make her laugh . She gave up on sleep and rolled onto her back , where he absently fondled one of her breasts and told her what was on his mind . <p> It was time to move on , he was thinking ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Coast thing was too obvious . He knew people , that was no problem , knew people in Spokane , Boise , shit , all the way to Chicago . What did Abby think of Pittsburgh ? He knew some people there . People were n't the problem . Problem was they needed a plan . A plan was more than a spot on the map , did she follow ? Gary Gilmore had been a plan , and coming up here was one too . What they needed was something like that but better , with growth potential . <p> He had talked until he 'd noticed his hand , or her under it . He 'd wanted to make love , and then he wanted to talk some more , but by then Abby was sleepy , and he agreed they 'd take it up again in the morning . He 'd lain there smoking beside her , muttering a word or two to himself , of encouragement or disgust . Before drifting off , Abby realized , Melissa 's dumped him , and now he has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact than an emotion , she felt sorry for him . <p> In the morning she packed her duffel and stood looking at Dale sleeping only a minute or two . On the kitchen table she left a Post-it note . " Bye , " it said . " Thanks . " <p> Abby had never been in this part of town . It was the opposite direction from the Greyhound , where she 'd use her last cash for a ticket or see if someone would give her a ride . It was a nice neighborhood , tall trees arching and groomed yards , a grade school where she could see children at their desks , the crossing brigade with their yellow hardhats and stop signs just setting up at the corner . A cable truck turned up the street ; two men jogged by , causing her to turn to the side so they could pass . <p> It was a modest corner house , white slatting and blue trim , a bird feeder out front , a long hedge , neatly kept , running along the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car but did n't see it . She walked up to the small front porch , where there was a bench and a pile of mail . She laid down the sweater , the wallet , the jar of hand cream she had never opened , and looked briefly at the yard , the house , the street , before she turned and headed downtown , toward the bus station . <p> She was napping in the den chair , heavily asleep when she heard someone on the front steps . She assumed it was the mailman , then realized she 'd heard him already , before she closed her eyes . <p> She made her way to the front door and saw what was on the mail bench . She gathered the sweater , the wallet , the jar of cream and , still groggy , not understanding what she was doing , hurried down the walk and looked both ways up the street . Maybe a fringe of a jacket , a flip of brown hair over a white face just turning the corner . She was n't certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run , about what she was doing hustling down the street in her robe , her ridiculous slippers scuffing the sidewalk , Mrs. Lewis across the way commencing a wave , then seeing her better and pausing , mouth open , hand suspended by her ear . Roberta had no idea what she 'd do if she caught the girl , what could possibly happen then . She could n't even be sure she was heading the right way . But she would catch her , that much she knew . She would catch her and make her stop even just for a moment so she could look at her and say , Take these . Please . I want you to . And after that , Roberta had to believe , she would know what to do next . <p>
