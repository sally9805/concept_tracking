<p> A promotional spot for the National Association of Realtors came on the radio the other day . The spot , introduced as something called " Newsmakers , " was supposed to sound like a news report , with the association 's president offering real estate advice . <p> " This is the best time to buy , " Pat Vredevoogd Combs , the president , said cheerfully . " There 's a lot of inventory in the marketplace . Interest rates are low . It 's a wonderful tax deduction . " <p> By the Realtors ' way of thinking , it 's always a good time to buy . Homeownership , they argue , is a way to achieve the American dream , save on taxes and earn a solid investment return all at the same time . <p> That 's how it has worked out for much of the last 15 years . But in a stark reversal , it 's now clear that people who chose renting over buying in the last two years made the right move . In much of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida and the Southwest , recent home buyers have faced higher monthly costs than renters and have lost money on their investment in the meantime . It 's almost as if they have thrown money away , an insult once reserved for renters . <p> Most striking , perhaps , is the fact that prices may not yet have fallen far enough for buying to look better than renting today , except for people who plan to stay in a home for many years . <p> With the spring moving season under way , The New York Times has done an analysis of buying vs. renting in every major metropolitan area . The analysis includes data on housing costs and looks at different possibilities for the path of home prices in coming years . <p> It found that even though rents have recently jumped , the costs that come with buying a home  --  mortgage payments , property taxes , fees to real estate agents  --  remain a lot higher than the costs of renting . So buyers in many places are basically betting that home prices will rise smartly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is about the average amount of time recent buyers have remained in their homes , prices in the Los Angeles area would have to rise more than 5 percent a year for a typical buyer there to do better than a renter . The same is true in Phoenix , Las Vegas , the New York region , Northern California and South Florida . In the Boston and Washington areas , the break-even point is about 4 percent . <p> " House prices have to fall more before housing becomes a clear buy again , " says Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody 's Economy.com , a research company that helped conduct the analysis . " These markets are n't as overvalued as they were a year ago or two years ago , but they 're still unfriendly . And that 's one of the reasons the market is still soft  --  people realize it 's not a bargain . " <p> There is obviously no way to know what home prices will do in the next few years . But there are two big reasons to doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again a great time to buy . <p> The first is history . After the last big run-up in house prices , in the 1980s , a long slump followed . In the New York area , prices peaked in early 1989 and then fell 9 percent over the next three years , according to government data . ( Adjusted for inflation , the drop was much bigger . ) Not until 1998 did prices pass their earlier peak . <p> Keep in mind that the 2000-5 boom was even bigger than the ' 80s boom and that house prices on the coasts , according to the official numbers at least , have fallen only slightly so far . So it is hard to imagine that prices will rise 5 percent a year , or another 28 percent in all , over the next five years . <p> The second reason for skepticism is that buying has never been quite as beneficial as Realtors  --  and mortgage brokers , home builders and everybody else who makes money off home purchases  --  have made it out to be . Buyers have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renters have the taxes included in their monthly rent bill . Buyers also face thousands of dollars in closing costs ( and , in Manhattan , co-op charges ) . Renters , meanwhile , can invest what they would have spent on closing costs and a down payment in the stock market , which has n't exactly delivered a bad return over the last 20 years . <p> And that famous mortgage-interest tax deduction ? Yes , it reduces the borrowing costs that come with a mortgage , but it does n't eliminate them . Renters do n't face any such borrowing costs . <p> Almost two years ago , I interviewed a thoughtful 37-year-old man named Tchaka Owen , who happens to be a real estate agent . ( Whatever the sins of the Realtors ' association , there are a lot of smart , helpful agents out there . Just remember that they have a financial interest in getting you to buy a house . ) <p> Mr. Owen and his girlfriend , Polly Thompson , had recently moved from the Washington suburbs to the Miami area and decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can get so much more for your money , renting instead of buying , " he said at the time . <p> Sure enough , house prices soon began to fall in South Florida , and Mr. Owen and Ms. Thompson started to think about buying a place . A three-bedroom Mediterranean-style house that they liked was originally listed for $620,000 last year , but the price was later cut to $543,000 . They bought it in June for $516,000 . Since then , the market has fallen further , but Mr. Owen said he did n't mind , because they plan to stay in the house at least a decade . " We love it , " he told me . <p> Clearly , there are benefits to owning a house beyond the financial , like the comfort of knowing you can stay as long as you want or can fix the roof without permission . But real estate has been sold as more than a good way to spend money . It has been sold as a can't-miss investment . Back in 2005 , near the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' association , David Lereah , published a book called " Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom ? " The can't-miss argument was wrong then , and it may still be wrong today . <p> After hearing that radio spot , I called Ms. Combs and asked her whether she thought there was any chance that she and her fellow Realtors had gone a bit too far in promoting the boom . " I absolutely disagree , " she said , still cheerful . " We help people look at the marketplace . " <p> So I asked what advice she gave her own clients in Grand Rapids , Mich. , where she is an agent . " We often tell people that they need to stay in a house five to six years for it to make sense , " she said . <p> That 's a nuance that did n't make it into her " Newsmakers " interview . In Grand Rapids , where the median home costs $130,000 , it is probably good advice . In a lot of other places , it may still be too @ @
