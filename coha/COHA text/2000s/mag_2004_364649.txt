When you are prospecting for hundreds of thousands of signatures , you ca n't afford to miss any opportunity . So Ralph Nader had a few tips for the small group of volunteers who were brainstorming last Wednesday night at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va. , a state where an independent presidential candidate needs 10,000 signatures to get on the ballot . " It 's a very good time to be doing it right now , at graduations , " Nader ventured , " and sporting events and churches . " Someone else proposed canvassing obvious lefty hangouts like vegan restaurants and bookstore cafes . The volunteers briefly debated waylaying people on bike paths , and then decided doing so would probably annoy them . But Nader 's Virginia campaign coordinator , Jim Polk , knew where to find a mother lode of registered voters willing to put their names on a Nader petition . " Truck pulls , " Polk said , patting his well-traveled clipboard as he suggested a quintessential red-state event . " People think they 're doing George Bush a favor if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best luck at truck pulls . " <P> NASCAR for Nader , perhaps ? Once again , Ralph Nader is making Democrats very , very nervous . Polls show him running in the single digits both nationally and in battleground states , but that could conceivably be enough to swing a state or two in what insiders expect to be another close election . As the news from Iraq gets even worse , Nader  --  who supports a total withdrawal of U.S. forces in six months  --  could become the candidate of choice for the most hard-core antiwar voters , who may see little difference between John Kerry 's stay-the-course approach and Bush 's . " Unlike 2000 , Nader now has a single issue that can fuel him , " says a worried Democratic official . Party strategists also say they are seeing signs that Nader is drawing some support from the kind of anti-Washington voters who flocked to Ross Perot in 1992 . <P> Although Nader rejects the idea that he cost Al Gore the 2000 election , it is an article of faith among Democratic leaders that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nader votes was significantly greater than Bush 's thin margin of victory ; Gore would be President had he won either state . " In 2000 we made a mistake because we ignored Nader for months , " says Gore 's former campaign manager Donna Brazile . " We gave him time not only to build a credible movement but also to get inside battleground states and hold huge rallies . " <P> This time Nader faces a different challenge of his own . Whereas the consumer advocate got onto nearly every state ballot as the Green Party nominee four years ago , Nader is now trying to do it the hard way  --  as an independent . He says he wants to start a political movement that would transcend party labels . But his independent status requires him to make his way through a dizzying set of rules and deadlines . To get on the ballot in Tennessee , he needs the signatures of only 275 registered voters ; in North Carolina it takes 100,532 . Nader fell at least 14,000 short of the 64,000 he needed in Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended . He could have secured a place on Oregon 's ballot by bringing together 1,000 voters for a single event , but only 750 showed for his rally last month in Portland  --  where more than 7,000 came to hear him in 2001.
