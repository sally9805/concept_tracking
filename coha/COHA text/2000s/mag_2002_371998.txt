It 's not going to be a country club , " said Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld last week , describing the new military detention camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and nobody ever expected it would be . The 110 al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners admitted to " Gitmo " by the end of last week are , said Rumsfeld , " the hardest of the hard core , " men who had killed " dozens and dozens of people . " But though it may lack tennis courts and a putting green , the amenities are better than you 'd find in a cave at Tora Bora . True , prisoners are now confined to 6-ft. by 8-ft. chain-link enclosures with concrete floors and tin roofs ( Rumsfeld thinks it 's " pejorative " to call them cages ) . But relief will come ; in three months , the Pentagon hopes to replace the facility with something more permanent . <P> In the meantime , the prisoners at Camp X-Ray  --  as the place has been called since the early 1990s when it housed Haitian refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to sleep and pray , and are allowed to shower and exercise . They are provided with a medical exam upon admission , and their diet ( is someone making a point about diversity here ? ) ranges from bagels and cream cheese to rice and beans  --  all eaten with plastic utensils  --  after which the prisoners may clean their teeth with specially shortened brushes . ( The caution makes sense ; in 2000 Mamdouh Salim , an al-Qaeda operative awaiting trial in New York City for his part in the 1998 embassy bombings , used a comb to stab a prison guard through the eye . ) <P> So far , humanitarian groups have been muted in their criticism of the conditions at Guantanamo . Last week a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross arrived to inspect the camp and offer private recommendations on its operation . But in the European press , the prisoners ' lot has become a public issue of contention among those who demand that U.S. conduct be above suspicion . Three detainees are said to have claimed to be British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all held in Gitmo must be guaranteed treatment in accordance with international law . The Daily Telegraph , a paper usually so conservative that it makes Pat Buchanan look vegetarian , warned Washington of the need to draw a " distinction between civilized society and the apocalyptic savagery of those who would destroy it . " <P> At the heart of the matter is a question of legality . The Pentagon has resisted calling the detainees prisoners of war , preferring the terms unlawful combatants or battlefield detainees . It 's easy to see why . Under the Geneva Convention , those holding true POWs are bound to release them at the end of hostilities ; but that is the last thing the U.S. wants to do with men who may be al-Qaeda operatives . Moreover , by convention ( though the law seems to be murky here ) POWs do n't need to tell their captors anything other than their name , rank , serial number and birthday . But for Washington , the whole point of the detention is to conduct interrogations and thus head off new acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
