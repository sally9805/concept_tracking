The Battle of Algiers grabbed audiences in 1965 with its stark depiction of Algerian rebels ' bloody , victorious war against French colonial authorities . Now Criterion is releasing the DVD with many extra features , including commentary by Richard Clarke , former U.S. counterterrorism czar . Clarke spoke with TIME 's Carolina A.

After 9/11 , the President asked for a chart of al-Qaeda managers so that as we captured them , he could cross out their names . I had a flashback to the movie where the French colonel , Mathieu , crosses out the names of terrorists , thinking he is winning .

I suggested it to Condi Rice . <P> THE DVD HAS A SHORT FILM ON DIRECTOR GILLO PONTECORVO 'S RETURN TO ALGERIA , IN WHICH HE NOTES ALGERIAN CONTEMPT FOR THE WEST . WHY DO YOU THINK THIS EXISTS ? It 's a residual colonialism issue . Al-Qaeda says the U.S. invasion of Iraq is an attempt to reinstall colonial rule . That resonates .
