But while the lunges and squats Walshe is prescribing might look familiar , the coach is going to change the way you perform them . Walshe is a proponent of eccentric lifting , a technique that increases the demand on the muscles by slowing down the first part of the lift ( four to five seconds ) and then ramps up your power by having you burst back to the starting position ( a second or less ) . The strategy mimics the demands of skiing . By slowing the first phase of the lift , you 'll train your body to withstand the high downward forces of making a turn ; by using explosiveness to drive the weight upward , you 'll build the large universal muscles  --  glutes , hamstrings , and quads  --  that give you the reflexes and power to move quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting is more typical of the downward contraction pattern that 's dominant in skiing , " says Walshe . The closer you can get to replicating a movement in the gym , he says , the better the lift will transfer to the sport for which you train . The second difference in Walshe 's plan is the range of motion required . The conventional commandment among weight jockeys is to never bend your legs beyond a 90-degree angle while performing a squat . Whereas most trainers teach their pupils to halt a squat descent at chair-sitting height , Walshe advises you to keep going , descending " until the bum touches the heels , if possible . " The reason , again , is to emulate the demands of skiing . You 'll be simulating what your body actually does on the hill by putting your legs into a weighted crouch in as many planes of motion as possible . ( Think of the times you need to recover from the out-of-control hip-check . ) " As long as your progressions are incremental , controlled , and managed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about needing to stop at parallel to save the knees . " Which does n't mean you do n't have to be careful with his how-low-can-you-go philosophy . While performing these lifts , pay close attention to keeping your knees in alignment . Always point them forward ( rather than letting them splay in and out ) while descending and ascending during lifts . If you 're having trouble keeping up good form , reduce the amount of weight you 're using . In addition , because the lifts also stress your vertebrae , make sure to engage ( read : flex ) your abs and lower back for support . Finally , choose an appropriate amount of weight to start ( see " Weight Savvy , " left ) . Walshe 's plan demands a commitment of three days a week . Consider making Mondays and Thursdays your lower body days ( see " Six- Week Training Plan , " page 145 , for the full details ) , saving Wednesdays to keep your arms , shoulders , and chest from atrophying in comparison . After all , you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to four weeks , you 'll keep the exercises the same but increase your weights and decrease your reps enough so that you reach muscle fatigue after only six reps . This will increase your overall power . Last but not least , be sure to start with a 20-minute upper- and lower-body warm-up before lifting : Skipping rope , spinning on a bike , or jogging are your best bets . " You want to get really good and sweaty first , to make sure your muscles are warm , " says Walshe . Lower Body ( Mon. , Thurs. ) 1 BARBELL SQUAT WHY : The " foundation lift " for skiing . Builds quads , glutes , knee stabilizers , and lower back . HOW : Holding a barbell on your shoulders , feet shoulder-width apart , descend to 90 degrees ( or farther if you can ) in a careful and controlled motion , keeping a straight back . Come back up to standing position slowly .

" 2 BARBELL FORWARD LUNGE WHY : Builds stabilizer muscles in hamstrings and glutes in extended positions . HOW : With a barbell on your shoulders , step forward until your front leg reaches a 90-degree angle . Keep both feet facing forward for correct knee and hip alignment . Push off front foot back to the starting position . EXTRA CREDIT SINGLE LEG PRESS Using a leg press machine , slowly lower the weight with one leg so your ankle almost touches your glutes . Come back to the starting position , keeping your knee aligned and your core tight . Repeat on the other side . 3 BARBELL LATERAL STEP-UP WHY : Builds hamstrings and quads in a deep lateral position . HOW : With a barbell on your shoulders , start with your feet on the floor and step up onto a 12-inch box , then step down on other side into a deep squat . Return to the starting side . That equals one rep . Repeat on other side . EXTRA CREDIT CALF RAISE Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box .

EXTRA CREDIT STIFF-LEGGED DEAD LIFT Keeping your back straight , bend at the waist with knees slightly bent . Grab a barbell from the floor and straighten to an upright standing position by hinging at the waist until the barbell reaches mid thigh . Lower the bar back to the floor . Maintain a tight core to protect your back . 5 BARBELL LATERAL LUNGE ( NOT PICTURED ) WHY : Builds support and strength in hips , glutes , and hamstrings in laterally-extended movements .

Repeat on left . Upper Body ( Wed. ) 1 BENT-OVER ROW WHY : Builds lats , shoulders , and biceps ; excellent for pulling movements ( like starting out of a gate ) and lower-back support . HOW : Place right knee and right hand on a bench ( leaning over ) , while keeping left leg straight and on the floor . Lift a dumbbell with your left hand and bring your tricep toward the ceiling so the weight reaches your chest . Repeat on the right side . EXTRA CREDIT UPRIGHT ROW Using an upright rowing machine , keep your back straight and shoulders down and back , and slowly pull the handles towards your waist . Release back to the starting position . 2 SEATED SHOULDER PRESS WHY : Builds shoulders and triceps . HOW : Sit on a bench with back support and hold dumbbells in both hands .

HOW : Starting on an assisted machine , lower your body until your elbows create a 90-degree angle . Keep your shoulders down and back . Move up to low reps ( 5-6 ) with body weight . WEIGHT SAVVY Pinpointing your starting weight can be intimidating if you 're not a gym junkie . To get started , pick the highest possible weight you can lift with good form for 10 to 12 repetitions . You should just barely be able to lift the 12th one in a controlled manner . That 's the goal : Studies show that 10 to 12 reps is the zone where you build muscular strength . To find your 12-rep weight , start with an empty bar to familiarize your body with the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight disks conservatively , trying out lifts with the ascending loads , until you find your 12-rep weight . Load the least weight for those lifts that challenge your lower back ( dead lifts ) , which is especially vulnerable to injury and requires extra attention to form , and always work with a spotter at unfamiliar motions . When it comes time to increase the weight , wait until you can do three sets at 12 reps without crying for mercy . SIX-WEEK TRAINING PLAN If you 've been following Walshe 's endurance timetable , you should have two weeks left of your cardio work . Start integrating your remaining cardio into your strength training for the first two weeks while you become familiar with the weights and hone your form . In weeks three and four , you 'll increase the weight so that you max out at 12 reps . In weeks five and six , you 'll make a final push for power  --  increase weight , cut the reps down to six , add five extra credit lifts  --  to round you into top form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workouts ) High reps ( 12 ) , low weight to polish form M : Lower Body 3 sets , 12 reps for each exercise plus 60-minute Endurance Cardio workout T : Interval Workout W : Upper Body 3 sets , 12 reps for each exercise plus Interval workout TH : Interval Workout F : Lower Body 3 sets , 12 reps for each exercise plus 60-minute Endurance Cardio workout WEEKS 3-4 Low reps ( 6 ) , higher weight to build raw strength M/F : Lower Body 3 sets , 6 reps for each exercise W : Upper Body 3 sets , 6 reps for each exercise WEEKS 5-6 Low reps ( 6 ) , higher weight , plus three more advanced exercises to build power M/F : Lower Body 3 sets , 6 reps for each exercise plus Extra Credit lifts for both upper and lower body .
