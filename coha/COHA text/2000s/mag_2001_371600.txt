The war in Afghanistan is going well . The Rockaway plane crash is looking like an ordinary accident . And there are no new anthrax victims . Seems like a good time to enjoy a breather , a holiday from seriousness , the seriousness we woke up to on Sept. 11 . Hence the righteous fulmination from critics left and right against measures the Bush Administration has put in place to detain , question and try suspected terrorists . <P> Yes , more than 1,000 have been held in connection with Sept. 11 , many on flimsy charges like visa expiration . Well , Zacarias Moussaoui , arrested in August , signed up for flight school in Minnesota to learn how to fly but not land or take off . He will not talk . Shall we let him go ? <P> Do the Bush measures bend the law ? Of course they do . But law is designed to punish past crimes . Unfortunately , we are at war . And in wartime , the imperative is to prevent the enemy from perpetrating future crimes . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this : there is a nuclear bomb hidden in New York City . It is set to go off in 30 minutes . You have captured a terrorist who knows where it is . To find out , are you allowed to torture him , let alone suspend his Miranda rights ? <P> Only a moral idiot would say no . <P> We are not in quite such extremis . But we are in a situation of critical danger . Newly discovered documents in Kabul confirm that al-Qaeda was working on chemical and biological poisons , and the group was eagerly pursuing materials to build an atomic weapon . No one doubts bin Laden would use it . Taliban leader Mullah Omar declared last Thursday that his objective was the " extinction of America " : " The plan is going ahead ... this will happen within a short period of time ; keep in mind this prediction . " <P> Yes , this sounds like bravado . But so did bin Laden 's anti-American rants before Sept. 11 . Al-Qaeda has agents in dozens of countries , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cite just three wartime American leaders , bent the peacetime structure of rights to avert national disaster . President Bush is right to follow their example . As Justice Robert Jackson said , the Constitution is not a suicide pact . <P> The critics are particularly outraged that the President has authorized special military tribunals  --  like those set up by F.D.R. for Nazi saboteurs captured during World War II  --  to try the likes of bin Laden swiftly , secretly and without Miranda niceties . An apoplectic New York Times called the tribunals " a travesty of justice " and " a dangerous idea , made even worse by the fact that it is so superficially attractive . " <P> I 'll take the superficial attractiveness , thank you . For one thing , it avoids the insanity of bringing Osama to trial in the U.S. or at the Hague . Just imagine the scene . It would be the biggest media circus in history . It would make the O.J. trial look like a school-board truancy hearing . It would offer the greatest platform for the propagation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career with the 1923 Munich trial for his pathetic beer-hall putsch .
