<p> THE last two times the Memorial football team has reached the Class 5A playoffs , Baytown Lee has been just good enough to knock the Mustangs out . <p> There 's nothing Memorial head coach Gary Koch would n't do to get back to the postseason and pit wits and players against Baytown coach Dick Olin again . <p> " You 're not going to forget that ( the losses ) , " Koch said . " It 's certainly a motivator , but you have a long way before you get to that point . You want to get back there again and redeem yourself in that situation . <p> " We know their offensive style and it 's the same on defense . For all their scoring ( during the regular season ) , we played them twice and they scored only 37 points , but we scored 31 , so the difference between the teams is minimal . But I 've got 10 difficult games with seven critical games before that occurs . " <p> Spring practice is the time when a playoff drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be introduced to the team and the bigger , faster talent at the varsity level . There are positions vacated by senior graduates that need to be filled . And coaches have to alter their offensive and defensive game plans slightly to fit the abilities of the new class . <p> " We did what we wanted to do , which is find who our top 60 are and do a good portion of our fundamental offense and defense , the things we deem important , " Koch said . " We 're probably not as fast in the backfield with the departure of Devon Green , but it wo n't change that much . We 'll still be a between-the-tackle team . We 're going to rely a great deal on our offensive line and we have three starters back there . <p> " We 're probably in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 seniors . There will be some younger kids and maybe we 'll have some sophomores up , but right now I 'm not absolutely sure . There was enough competition where I still have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are solidly entrenched in their positions are the ones coming back from last season 's 7-4 campaign ( 6-1 in 21-5A ) . <p> The juniors will rule the offensive line , with 11-game starters in center David Colquitt and left tackle Austen Reade as well as nine-game starter Wade Lytal at right guard . <p> Senior wide receiver Chad Walker returns for his third season on varsity . Fullback Zach Kenney , who was third on the team in attempts ( 79 ) , second in yards ( 408 ) and third in average per carry ( 5.2 ) in 2002 , impressed Koch with his switch to tailback as did junior Koby Clemens , who also plays cornerback . <p> " Koby looked good at corner and tailback in terms of coverage and tackling ability and he showed some real good hips in terms of running the football , " Koch said . " He has a little bit of speed , so he could create some problems for defenses . He 's not Devon speed , but he is Patrick Macaluso speed or maybe not quite that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macaluso was a sprinter on the track team and graduated this year . <p> Defense welcomes back senior all-district tackle Phillip Pappas , second team all-district senior linebacker Roy Sweeney , junior middle linebacker Will Harvey , all-district junior strong safety Jordan Lake , senior starting cornerback Matt Hebert , junior free safety Gray Lisenby and open defensive end senior Cody Brinkley . <p> " We 're experienced over there , " Koch said of his defense . " We 'll rely more on speed than on pure brute strength in the middle . " <p> The biggest step is replacing 6-foot-6 , 300-pound tackle Brad Girtman , who signed with Oklahoma State , qualified for admission and will play in this summer 's upcoming Oil Bowl and Texas High School Coaches Association all-star games . <p> Three seniors are battling for playing time at the position , including Robert Schelfer , returning letter winner Blake Von Blon and Joe Cortez . <p> " We may have to use all three of them , " said Koch . " It 's difficult to replace 6-6 , 300 who can move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe we have a chance . " <p> There are some players Memorial fans will want to watch , Koch said . These include defensive ends Drew Petrie , a senior , and junior Charles Reed ; linebacker Nate Jackson , who saw some playing time last year ; offensive right tackle Charles Roitsch ; senior letter winners right guards Beau Johnson and Dan King ; junior fullback Cash Cameron ; senior tight end John David Mattern , who played fullback some last season ; junior wide receiver Logan Prewett ; and senior wide receiver Garrett Van Waggeningen , who started three games before falling to injury and being bumped from the starting lineup . <p> Clemens will anchor one cornerback slot with senior letter winner Scott Gibson and junior Andy McConn also vying for playing time . <p> It was last summer when Koch got a sense that while his team in 2002 was n't totally being discounted , neither was it being picked to make the playoffs . But six straight victories to close the regular season assured the Mustangs of a postseason appearance and gave Koch some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year taught me that the expectations outside of our locker room were n't very high for us , " Koch said . " The players went to work and prepared and overcame the negative expectations . I learned also that if we come into this year with expectations that we 're going to be a good football team because some of these kids are back , and if we do n't prepare and work properly , it could turn the other way . " <p> This will be Koch 's 11th year at the helm , so there 's little chance he will let his players enter a game unprepared . With all the success Koch has had at Memorial , others might be surprised to know his base offense and defense have n't changed much since he took over the program . <p> " You ca n't replace enthusiasm , preparation and work with anything else , " Koch said . " The kids respond at Memorial to those things . To be successful anywhere , we have to be salesmen to some extent . This is what we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to fit our personnel . But what we 're doing now , we 're pretty much doing the same thing when we came in . <p> " If you do n't teach the fundamentals , then you 're going to have a hard time and wo n't have anything to fall back on when things go bad . The most important thing I 've learned is we better be teaching more than just football and there better be some carry over to make playing football a positive experience . If you take care of those things , then wins will take care of themselves . " <p> Stratford football <p> With the close of spring football drills , Stratford head coach Eliot Allen did n't feel quite so overwhelmed this year as he did when he took over the program in 2002 . <p> Part of the reason is he had a full coaching staff this spring to help him run the team through the motions ( he was four coaches short last season ) . That allowed Allen to turn his focus on the defense , which he coached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of splitting his time with the offense and defense . <p> " It 's always fun to hear the pads pop again , and there 's a lot of excitement in the air , " said Allen , who led the Spartans to a 6-4 record overall ( 4-3 in 21-5A ) . " Obviously , for me personally it 's easier because things were coming at me pretty fast last year . We were able to do a lot more on both sides of the ball this year . We have a lot of experience back on defense , so that allowed us to do more than we typically do . " <p> The defense , which only allowed two teams to score more than 19 points against it , returns first-team all-District 21-5A linebacker Brian Wolgamott , who had more than 100 tackles last season , second-team cornerback T.J. Simmons , who is also a return specialist , and honorable-mention tackle DeGarrian Evans . <p> Allen was able to install the base offense and defense this spring , and he was able to identify the players who are capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniors . <p> " I feel like our defense should be much improved , " Allen said . " We had eight guys coming back who started at some point during the season last year . We have starters on the ( defensive ) line , which we have n't had in a while . <p> " Offensively , we have a good running back in Eric Paulson . Last year he played a great deal ( 71 carries for 364 yards and five touchdowns ) . We 're going to have a big line and we have two guys who have experience coming back as full-time starters ( seniors John-Michael Haines , a second-team all-district pick , and Stephen Ray ) . We have a lot of people to choose from with eight or nine pushing for playing time . " <p> Fortunately , it 's was only spring when Paulson broke his tibia . He was to be out for another couple of weeks . <p> " You do n't want anybody to get injured , but if it had to happen , this is the time to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going through drills during a team session at the end of practice and fell on it wrong and it was a fluke deal . He was in good spirits and was out at practice afterwards ready to go . He just could n't do that with a cast on his foot . "
