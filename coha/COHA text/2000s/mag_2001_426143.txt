Big ideas often start in small-and computer  --  cluttered-spaces in California 's Silicon Valley , still the top address for geniuses and entrepreneurs in the online universe . Camped in a rented room in Belmont , south of San Francisco , the founders of FHP Wireless work late writing and testing software and plotting how to raise capital . They believe they have developed technology to create inexpensive and easy-to-use wireless networks . In true Valley style , they believe they will change the world . a small earthquake hit Palo Alto my second day in town . The bedside lamp vibrated , nothing more , but it was a reminder that the San Andreas Fault snakes down this part of California . Several days later Jim Calzia , a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey , drove me out to see the San Andreas , which translates on the landscape as a low green trough . The Big One is predicted sometime in the next 30 years , Calzia said . It could be a 7 in magnitude : utterly catastrophic . " So why do people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed a grin . " How lucky do you feel ? " he said . Silicon Valley thrives on risk . Ever since 1933 when Frederick Terman , a professor of engineering at Stanford University , mentored two undergraduates named Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , the Valley has been about placing bets on people , ideas , and inventions . Terman 's proteges would go on to found Hewlett-Packard , the Valley 's pioneer high-tech company . Since then Silicon Valley has attracted the best and brightest from all over the world . It has as intellectual capital two great universities : Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley . It is home base to a who 's who of technology and the incubator for hundreds of graduates seeking to emulate Hewlett and Packard . It was here that Pong , the first video game , went from dream to reality , as well as the ink-jet printer , the video recorder , the mouse , the personal computer , and much else we take for granted in the information age . The expertise of Silicon Valley has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its high-flying peak in 2000 , 43 of Forbes magazine 's 400 richest Americans lived here . Their wealth added up to an estimated 184 billion dollars , and if you believed the hype , 60 new millionaires were minted each day . Dot-com fever fueled the jackpot economy ; secretaries cashed in options and drove off in Porsches . But in the opening months of 2001 the headlines wept financial woe . The Nasdaq , the technology-heavy stock index , had plunged more than 50 percent from its high a year earlier . Dot-coms foundered and sank . Even solid companies like Cisco , Intel , and HewlettPackard hoisted warning flags of workforce cuts and lower earnings . To add insult to injury , a power crisis had erupted in California . Blackouts stunned the state . You could build the fastest , smallest , most powerful computer , plug it in , and nothing happened . Still the mood in the Valley registered optimistic , as if the water supply were fluoridated with Prozac . " We call it techno-optimism , " said Jan English-Lueck , a professor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addiction to opportunity , and if you do n't see it that way , why are you even here ? " Silicon Valley is not a piece of official geography but a nickname for a 1,500-square-mile piece of northern California that runs from the outskirts of San Francisco south through Santa Clara County . It is an extended suburb of flat monotony , except for the expensive green idyll of residential areas such as Portola Valley and the grandeur of Stanford . Silicon Valley is an interior geography , a terrain made visible by grace of fluorescent and halogen light , connected by concrete tentacles of freeway . " What would you show someone who came to visit Silicon Valley ? " Chuck Darrah , a professor of anthropology , and his colleagues at San Jose State asked in a study of Valley families . " Yosemite , Monterey Aquarium , and Lake Tahoe , " they 'd respond . " Yes , but they are n't in Silicon Valley , " Darrah would point out . There is the weather , which for much of the year consists of unbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made khakis and a shirt the business uniform of choice . The live-and-let-live mind-set means anything goes . You are free to dye your hair blue , be openly gay , bare your navel ring at work , start a multimillion-dollar company . No one bats an eyelash . Two years ago Marcia Babiak was a math teacher in northern Illinois , until a trip to California for a teacher 's conference changed her life . " Driving from the airport , I saw Candlestick Park , the Pacific Ocean , and fell in love with the place , " she said . " Three weeks later I moved here . " Now she teaches at Mountain View High School . " I 'm never going back , " she burbled . " I love the place , I love the school , I love the kids . " " What do n't you like here ? " I asked . " The living expense , " she replied . She makes $48,000 a year , but after paying $1,150 a month for an apartment smaller than her classroom and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you like about living here ? " " The freedom to be who I am . " " Think Florence with numbers ; Morton Grosser , a consulting scientist based in Palo Alto , had said by way of explaining Silicon Valley . Instead of painters and sculptors , the Valley has geeks and nerds , and they are as passionate about circuitry as Michelangelo was about marble . A computer whiz said he built an Altair 8800 , one of the first do-it-yourself computer kits , because " it was cool and I wanted one . ' Les Vadasz , an executive vice president at Intel , said that for an engineer the excitement is the project . " You know that what you are working on is ahead of the curve , ahead of everyone else . It 's a sport . A game . " In his living room overlooking San Francisco Bay , Roger O'Neill showed me a metal box the size of a hatbox . O'Neill , a biochemist , is vice president of research and development at a small company called Guava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of flow cytometer . Simply put , it peeks inside a cell to see what 's going on : to discern how , for example , a cell is reacting to a certain antibiotic . The instrument is not new , but because of the technology this particular model is one-twentieth the size of its competitors and more affordable , he said . Explain the kick , I asked . He walked me over to a shelf over the mantle . " My grandfather and father built model trains , " he said . He showed me a locomotive and cars . The detailing was exquisite-from the planks on the siding of the boxcars to the wheel spokes on the locomotive , and it was all made by hand . " This was something they did purely for the joy of creating , " he said . " It 's not necessarily designing something from scratch that thrills me . For me the thrill comes from innovating within a basic design and making something beautifully that performs its purpose . " Silicon Valleyspeak has its roots in the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , and if he plays in three different basketball leagues ( as some do ) , there is value added in that his teammates ' parents may turn out to be CEOs of companies you might be interested in . Vacation is downtime , but hardly anyone leaves a cell phone or handheld at home . VCs are venture capitalists , the financiers of Silicon Valley . They round up the capital  --  from pension funds , wealthy individuals , and universities-needed to underwrite a fledgling company . Last year venture capitalists in the Valley invested an estimated 17 billion dollars in new companies , known as start-ups . Why not go to a banker ? I asked Morton Grosser . Grosser is a start-up investor and technology adviser to many VC firms , including Kleiner Perkins Caufield &; Byers , one of the biggest , so we meet for lunch at a Menlo Park cafe called the Left Bank for a lesson in Venture Capitalism 101 . " Bankers are to the right of Herbert Hoover , " he explained . " Most of those guys have never risked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great idea . They 're going to get on their knees in front of the president of a bank ? They 're going to have collateral ? " VCs , who take a cut of the company and a seat on the board as their pay , could n't care less about collateral . They lay out money for what a conservative institution would regard as unacceptable risk . " I went to Paris , on invitation of the government , " Grosser said . " They wanted to know how to have a Silicon Valley in France . So you have a glass of red wine with the bankers and hear them grumble : Kids these days do n't know how to work . These kids do n't know anything . So what do you do to create a Silicon Valley ? ' the bankers finally ask . " It 's simple , I tell them . You have to have a good technical education , financial training , and you have to have worked for a real company . Many VCs in Silicon Valley have started their own companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to be willing to listen to a group of **25;61;TOOLONG . " His eyes danced . " They go pale . You do n't understand . It 's not so easy , ' they sputter . And greed plays a part , " he said . " They want a Silicon Valley too . But they are so traditional , they ca n't do what needs to be done . " He was talking about cultural arteriosclerosis , an Old World hierarchy that stifles the freewheeling entrepreneurial spirit that fuels Silicon Valley . The kind of spirit that prompted Bill Hewlett to answer the phone and listen to a 12-year-old named Steve Jobs who had called to ask for some parts for a piece of electronics he was building . Hewlett later hired Jobs , who would go on to found Apple Computers . " Great cities are born because of the discovery of gold or oil or because of geography and the location of a port , " Grosser said . " The natural resource here is brains . " Despite the intellectual firepower of the Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , a subterranean rumble of something I could n't put words to . Maybe it was the dozens of Mercedes and BMWs in the student parking lot of Palo Alto High School , knowing the principal drives a 1991 gray Nissan truck . Or hearing one too many stories about the guy with a Mercedes and four-bedroom home who crybabied because he had n't cashed in on the dot-com boom like his zillionaire buddies . Perhaps it was the 25-year-old who worked at Yahoo ! who , when I expressed the hope my 15-year-old son would always know his way around a library , told me with faint disdain I should stop treating books like fetishes . Maybe it was standing under the trees at the Drop-In Center run by the Urban Ministry in downtown Palo Alto , where homeless men and women turn up each morning for a cup of coffee directly opposite Stanford University and the high-end stores in the Stanford Shopping Center . Besides providing a list of resources ( " Where to take a shower , " " Where to get medical help " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , first served . " The bus tickets are very important to these men , " Sergio Samame , a caseworker , explained , as a line formed under the shade of a metal overhang . " Why ? " I asked . " They have nowhere to sleep . So they ride the bus all night . " gentlemen , ladies . Attention please . Palm Pilots in hand ? Business cards in reach ? Ready ? Set ? We are going to network . Rule number one . Opportunity surrounds you . A meal with friends ? Heads up . Case the room . Is n't that Steve Jobs at the next table ? Your daughter 's school play ? Why not ? CEOs have daughters too . Visit the University Cafe in Palo Alto , Buck 's in Woodside , or Il Fornaio in San Jose . Look around . See the two guys at that table ? The kid who looks like a high school sophomore is hoping to do a start-up . The older guy is a venture capitalist . They are cutting a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal pad ? They are devising a business plan . Your turn . Pull out your cell phone . Establish that you too are a player . " There was a fellow from France working here , " recalls Chuck Darrah , the anthropology professor at San Jose State . " He said that in France you would never talk about work in a social context . You 'd never ask people what they do . It just is n't done . When this guy got promoted , he invited all the people who worked for him to a barbecue in his backyard . " Mon dieu ! Midway through the party everyone had their business cards out . The host was appalled . Failure ! He wanted to run around and grab every card and fling them into the fire . He paused . The light clicked on . It 's normal ! That 's what everyone does here ! " Everyone ; Darrah said , " is perpetually on the make . " in Silicon Valley money is , with few exceptions , not inherited . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes , by the clever marketing of a mediocre one . " When people make money , the first thing they want is a really nice house , " said Paul Conrado , a high-end contractor based in Saratoga . His job is to build them those really nice houses . " Ego builds some of these homes , " he said , as we took off to see his work . " I have 12 houses going at the moment . The lowest is going to cost a million and a half , the highest is over four million , and that 's not including the cost of the land . Eleven clients are paying cash . " " We 're also building a thousand-square-foot barn costing $400,000 , " he added , casually . Marble floors ? A herd of horses ? " No , just two horses , " he said . " It 's a hightech barn with automatic watering troughs ; things like that cost a lot . " The centerpiece of a Conrado house is a vineyard . " In high-end houses , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You look out of your window at your vines while you drink wine from your own backyard . " We pulled up to a 9,000-square-foot Mediterranean style home he 'd built on a lot at the edge of Palo Alto just before it lifts into the foothills . The owner walked me through the house , which had a 12-seat movie theater and 1,200-bottle wine cellar . In the backyard a custom-built stream tumbled down a series of rocks to end in a pond , home to koi and a turtle-a nice vista for the guesthouse , which had a wood beam ceiling and its own kitchen . As we pulled out of the driveway , the conversation drifted to the subject of big money and bigger money . Conrado mentioned one client worth 500 million dollars . " I can understand what 5 million dollars is , " Conrado said . " I have a hard time understanding 500 million dollars . Of course , now that his options have dropped in value , he 's only worth 30 million . " Had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to go home and say : What 's my problem ? How come I did n't rise to that level ? Then I realized money ca n't buy your way out of most of life 's miseries . In this area your home is very important to you . That is probably why we build so many homes that feel like stages . People want to make a statement ; their home is how they do it . " Melita Singh would be happy if she could find a home , any home , to rent , but for now she , her husband , and their three children will have to get by in a room in the Boccardo Reception Center , a shelter for the homeless in San Jose . The Singhs are not poor . Mrs. Singh , who grew up in Trinidad , is a registered nurse who works in a nursing home . Mr. Singh works on contract for Hewlett-Packard . Between them , they have an income of $105,000 . But $105,000 a year is n't house-buying money in Silicon Valley , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them because of their noisy children . " You can throw money after scarce apartments all you want , but with an eviction you 're not getting anything , " said Maury Kendall of the Emergency Housing Consortium . So the Singhs are part of a new trend in homelessness . " It 's no longer hobos and bums . It 's working people-moms and dads impacted by the economic boom . " It is also a quirk of geography compounded by economics . The math is simple . The median apartment rental price is $1,600 . There is a 5 percent vacancy rate in Silicon Valley . Rentals are at a premium ; landlords rule . " Why should a landlord have to contend with pets or kids when there are plenty of renters without such liabilities ? " Kendall asked rhetorically . " We are reaping the harvest of years of poor planning . There is no affordable housing because it does n't exist . " Yet , there was optimism from Mrs. Singh . " I see this as the land of opportunity , " she effused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired gray carpet , and two double beds . She was feeding the baby , while three-year-old Josiah tugged at her shirt and five-year-old John bounced on the bed . " I tell you why I came to America " she said . " In my country it 's so limited . I love America . Land of opportunity . All will work out . " She lay back on the bed and laughed . Some do n't even have the luxury of a heated room with access to a bath . " We have clients who come through the door who live in garages , " Toni Wallace said . " They pay $500 to $600 a month for a garage with no toilet . Sometimes the space is n't insulated , let alone heated . " Wallace is director of a social services center in East Palo Alto , the predominantly Hispanic and African-American city separated by a highway from its more affluent neighbor , Palo Alto . Were things getting better ? " No. " she replied . As electric bills soared , things were getting worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day and feel you helped someone . Now you just do n't know , " Wallace said . " What do you do then ? " I asked . " We fall down , and we get back up . " the dot-com market had been in free fall , and at 550 Montgomery Street in San Francisco 's financial district you could pick through two floors of computer equipment and office furnishings from a defunct company called Stockpower.com to be auctioned the next day . Lee Harris , a businessman , looked at computers . He 'd bought desks and cabinets at previous auctions , where , for example , a $60,000 server had sold for $5,000 . " The buyers were jumping up and down , " he said . " It 's top quality stuff . Herman Miller chairs and office partitions that they practically pay you to take away . " His eyes lit up . " There 's a Mac ! " he said , and left to inspect lot #1143 Apple Power Mac G3 with 4GB HDD . Another dot-com ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest bidder . By late summer the Industry Standard , a magazine covering the Internet world , listed 139,643 dot-com layoffs since December 1999 , then went belly-up itself . What went wrong ? " A lot of start-up companies should never have been funded , " Karae Lisle said . She 's a business consultant in Menlo Park and den mother to a support group for CEOs of companies in trouble . " The venture capitalists threw money at companies like they were slot machines . Pets.com ? Like you 're going to shove a 30-pound bag of dog food through the mail slot to me ? What were they thinking ? " Standard business principles evaporated . " Every one of these kids was right out of business school , " Lisle continued . " If someone gave you a pair of cleats , a bat , and a glove , and you only played catch with your dad and never dropped a ball , what makes you think you can play the World Series ? " " Do you know , Dave , your company is valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco stock trader , told a friend whose dot-com had skyrocketed . " So who needs tires ? " his friend replied . Reports of the demise of Silicon Valley were premature . The patient was n't moribund , merely temporarily indisposed . " Every time Silicon Valley goes through a cycle , people say it 's doomed , " said AnnaLee Saxenian , a Berkeley professor of regional planning . " In 1980 I myself argued that housing and labor were too expensive , roads too crowded , that growth would shift elsewhere . Later they said it again , with the rise of technological Japan . But there are real companies here . It would be hard to argue that the Internet wo n't be an arena for business . It 's a question of who survives . Silicon Valley is not the traditional model . There are social intangibles . It 's not just dollars and cents . " In Silicon Valley the bust was not failure ; it was part of the learning curve . " It 's okay to fail nobly , " explained Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's one of the bedrock things that make this place different . In the East , if you fail , you 're a pariah . Not here " Melcher 's company , called There , involves the creation of an elaborate , sophisticated cyberspace playground , and it is , he knows , very high risk . Lee Hwang left a well-paying job in Atlanta because she wanted a change . She found it at There . Her brother-in-law is the chief technology officer for the company , and she had been hired to keep Cokes in the refrigerator and answer the phone . " I sold off everything I had and came here to work a 12-hour day , " she said , as we sat in the kitchen of the warehouse building that houses There in Menlo Park . " I have friends in Atlanta who think I 'm crazy . Even if it tanks , it 's an adventure . The coolness factor is high . I do n't want to reach the end of my life and have any regrets . " Hwang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the building where There is taking shape , a handful of employees were living in their offices and sleeping on futons . " It 's weird rolling out of bed and going to work , " confessed Matt Murakami , a 24-yearold artist . Murakami had moved from Orange County and , after a month 's stay with relatives , decided to move into his cubicle . He was working late nights , anyway , and could n't see paying $1,500 a month in rent . " I 've put my life on hold till the IPO initial public offering , ' he said . " If it were n't for the skylight in the building , I would n't know if it was night or day . " one morning the newspaper carries a story about a partner at a venture capital firm . She has two cell phones-a Nokia 6100 and a Nokia 8860-and two handheld computers-a Palm Vx and a Handspring Visor Edge-not to mention a BlackBerry RIM 957 e-mail device . At home the lineup is three computers ( one in the kitchen ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when I turn everything off is on a plane . Some may think that this is a character flaw , but I prefer to be always connected , ' " she is quoted as saying . Wired , perhaps . But connected ? " I must leave , " a woman at Stanford said , drawing the interview to a close . " I have an appointment with my psychiatrist . " She moved from the Midwest and is mourning the loss of not just a three-story house with 20 acres but also deep and true friends . " There is no time here for deep connections . There are no deep conversations and relationships , " she said . Distress shadowed her face . " I do n't have the words to express how I feel . I have to pay someone to talk about these things . " " I have a patient who begins by saying Everything is fine , but I feel like a machine , ' " said Kenneth Seeman , a psychiatrist in Palo Alto . " You are dealing with professions oriented toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . They hide behind that . " The genius of Silicon Valley helped wire the world . Its enterprise could get you an airline ticket , a refrigerator , or stock quote at the click of a mouse . But the social fabric seemed to be unraveling . Though the Valley 's per capita income increased 36 percent during the 1990s ( the national increase was 17 percent ) , by the year 2000 a household at the bottom 20 percent of the distribution scale had less income than in 1993 . The rising tide had n't lifted all boats . " We 're like a specialized athlete . We just do innovation and invention , " Jim Koch explains . Koch is director of the Center for Science , Technology and Society at Santa Clara University . He spoke about his recent report that examined the social capital-the community connectedness-of 40 different communities across the U.S. Although Silicon Valley ranked high in interracial trust and diversity of friendships , it landed near the bottom in civic engagement , charitable giving , volunteering , and civic leadership-and in sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koch explained , and they have to do , in part , with a business ethos that eschews commitment . " The culture says you do n't stay in one place very long . You jump from job to job . " I think we feel lonelier and more isolated , " he said . " I think life as a free agent is not what it 's cracked up to be . " Chinese New Year was approaching , and at the Lion Plaza mall on Tully Road-one of those faux California  --  mission confections of aqua and terra-cotta concrete-you could find Johnny Au selling plants . " For good fortune , " Au said , explaining the tradition . " Buy these pussy willows for silver , " he pulled a branch from a bucket . " And this tree , " he indicated a 15-year  --  old bonsai with yellow flowers , " for gold . " A New Year in all cultures is a chance to look back to the past and ahead to the future . Silicon Valley could look back to a wild ride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look forward . The Valley is about ideas and invention , but it is also about money-which happens to be one of the things people wish for you on the Chinese New Year . I had driven to Redwood City , the not-quite  --  as-chic town north of Atherton , to talk to George J. Leonard , a professor of humanities and Asian studies at San Francisco State University . We sat in his teahouse , a sanctuary really , in back of his modest home while Leonard poured green tea into thimble-like cups . As the fragrance of tea filled the room , we admired the translucent glaze of a celadon bowl and an earthenware pot in the shape of a lotus leaf . Silicon Valley sits on the edge of the future . Perhaps it even is the future . Yet , so many were being left behind . The contrasts were as unsettling as the earthquake zone that helps define its geography . To keep my balance , I needed an anchor , a steady handhold . Leonard offered one , using as a framework the teachings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to be rich and famous , ' " Leonard said . " It 's natural . Wealth and fame are what every man desires . ' " But Confucius understood there is a moral decision too , and sooner or later an accounting begins .
