Raines <p> Vice chairman and COO : Daniel H. Mudd <p> Employees : 5,100 <p> Local employees : 4,100 <p> DESCRIPTION : Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that plays a major role in the mortgage finance system by helping replenish money available for home mortgages . Like its sibling rival , Freddie Mac , it buys mortgages from banks and savings and loans . It holds some and repackages others for sale . With the perceived backing of the federal government , Fannie Mae , like Freddie Mac , can borrow money at favorable rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit on the spread . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : Fannie Mae spent much of last year dealing with the fallout from the accounting problems at Freddie Mac . Given the similarity between the two companies ' businesses , the billions of dollars of accounting errors at Freddie cast suspicion on Fannie . <p> Fannie chief executive Franklin D. Raines complained the problems at Freddie were raising Fannie 's borrowing costs . <p> " I 've jokingly said to friends that I now know what the definition of collateral damage is , and we have suffered a lot of that , I think unfairly , " Raines told reporters in July . " Unlike Freddie Mac , we did n't do any of these things . " <p> Fannie fanned the flames in October when it announced it had made computational errors of more than $1 billion in reporting quarterly financial results . The error , which understated stockholders ' equity , involved valuations of complex financial instruments known as derivatives , which had also bedeviled Freddie . <p> The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight began an examination of Fannie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office recently warned that the review could lead to a correction of Fannie 's past financial statements . <p> Also last year , Fannie began reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission , which it was exempt from doing because of its special status and which Freddie Mac has yet to do . <p> Fannie 's earnings last year climbed 71.1 percent . That was largely driven by unrealized changes in the value of derivatives the company held . In addition , the wave of refinancings produced a windfall for Fannie . That was because , as mortgages were prepaid , Fannie immediately booked income from guarantee fees that would have been spread over the full term of the loans . The company said it met a goal set in 1999 to double earnings in five years . <p> The problems at Freddie prompted members of Congress and the Bush administration to propose new ways of regulating the mortgage-funding companies . Fannie publicly stated that it supported a strong new regulator , but some members of Congress said it torpedoed the reform effort behind the scenes . Congress is still working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question the need for government sponsorship of Fannie and Freddie and the benefits they provide while warning that they could put the financial system at risk , criticisms Fannie rejects . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently advised lawmakers to limit the amount of debt the companies can take on and the volume of mortgages they can hold . <p> The Senate Banking Committee recently approved a bill that would give a new regulator the power to put Fannie and Freddie in receivership and liquidate them if they became insolvent , but the Bush administration said it opposed the bill because the committee had watered down the proposed receivership power too much . <p> 1680 Capital One Dr. <p> McLean , Va . 22102 <p> 703-720-1000 <p> www.capitalone.com <p> Founded : 1995 <p> Revenue : $9.78 billion <p> Net income : $1.14 billion <p> Earnings per share : $4.85 <p> Dividend : 11 cents <p> Stockholder equity : $6.05 billion <p> Auditor : Ernst &; Young LLP <p> Stock : COF ( NYSE ) <p> Assets : $46.28 billion <p> Market capitalization : $17.85 billion <p> 52-week high : $77.67 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Chairman , president and CEO : Richard D.

The company uses computers to collect consumer information and adjust credit profiles in a manner it says enables it to make changes more frequently and reliably than rivals . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : Capital One spent last year under a supervisory agreement , known as a memorandum of understanding , with federal banking regulators over concern that the company had not properly managed its risk during the preceding decade of rapid growth . The agreement was part of an overall crackdown by regulators on credit card lenders , especially on " subprime " loans , which are made to riskier borrowers . <p> The company announced in January 2004 that the agreement had ended . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would treat stock options as an expense against earnings , an about-face for a firm whose co-founders for years were paid in nothing but options and had argued against treating these contracts as a current cost . The company implemented the change in accounting policy for 2003 , a decision that cut its earnings for the year by $6.3 million , bringing them to $1.1 billion . It said the impact on earnings would be even larger for 2004 . <p> The company in the first quarter of 2003 announced that Chief Financial Officer David M. Willey was stepping down amid a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into a large stock sale he made . The SEC probe of Willey continues . The company said it is not a target of the probe . <p> On May 1 company co-founder Nigel W. Morris stepped down as president and chief operating officer , assuming the position of vice chairman of the board as a first step toward leaving the company . That happens at the end of this month , when Morris is scheduled to resign from the board . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to " pursue other interests . " Co-founder Richard D. Fairbank will continue as chairman and chief executive . <p> Morris 's departure comes amid the company 's adoption of a new management style . Instead of being run largely by the co-founders , as it was for years , the company is now run by an executive committee , with power and oversight more widely dispersed . <p> Last year , Capital One refocused its credit card growth on less-risky customers , known as the prime market , an emphasis it plans to continue . It also plans to continue to diversify into other lending areas , including small businesses , automobile buyers and international borrowers . Non-card lending now accounts for more than a third of the loans the company makes . <p> 11600 Sallie Mae Dr. <p> Reston , Va . 20193 <p> 703-810-3000 <p> www.salliemae.com <p> Founded : 1973 <p> Revenue : $4.16 billion <p> Net income : $1.53 billion <p> Earnings per share : $3.29 <p> Dividend : 59 cents <p> Stockholder equity : $2.63 billion <p> Auditor : PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP <p> Stock : SLM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalization : $18.24 billion <p> 52-week high : $43.00 ( 3/8/2004 ) <p> 52-week low : $35.60 ( 12/18/2003 ) <p> Chairman : Edward A.

Started with federal sponsorship in 1973 , it has been severing ties to the government since 1997 to become a private-sector company by next year , three years earlier than required by law . SLM owns 30 percent of all outstanding federally insured student loans . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : Since its founding as the Student Loan Marketing Association , SLM has had several name changes and a changed business plan . <p> Originally federally chartered but owned by shareholders , the company is now close to becoming fully private . Last year more than three-quarters of its outstanding loans were made with money raised by its private division , up from around half a year earlier .

It will be the first GSE , or government sponsored enterprise , to make the transition . <p> The company spent last year , as it has the last few years , filling in gaps in its business by acquiring other companies that mesh with its core business of making loans . For example , it 's now the largest collector of federally guaranteed loans and the largest such service provider for the Education Department . <p> The company continues to expand its core business , too . It holds the loans it makes in its own portfolio or pools them into asset-backed securities it then sells to Wall Street investors . The business continues to ride a wave of steadily rising tuition costs and increasing numbers of high school graduates who want to attend college , though in the fourth quarter earnings dropped 14 percent because of lower gains on the pooled loans . <p> In August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices in Reston to a new building .

It is also a stock broker , an asset-management firm and , since merging with its mortgage-investment unit last year , a real estate investment trust . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's numbers as though it had been merged for all of 2003 , earnings increased by two-thirds . <p> And in a difficult year for initial public offerings of stock , the company placed third among IPO underwriters on the Bloomberg Business News ' annual ranking , behind only Credit Suisse First Boston Corp . and Goldman Sachs . <p> The firm was the lead underwriter for the year 's biggest IPO , an $800 million deal for American Financial Realty Trust , a Pennsylvania real estate investment trust . <p> If the IPO market bounces back this year , some predict the 15-year-old firm , an upstart by Wall Street standards , will find it tough to keep that lead . Still , last year confirms Friedman , Billings has established itself as a serious out-of-town competitor to Wall Street 's traditional heavy hitters . <p> Its name will certainly be in the news more  --  on the sports page . FBR signed a five-year , $30 million deal to become the main sponsor of what used to be known as the Phoenix Open , now the FBR Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf season . With more than half a million fans attending the January event in Scottsdale , Ariz. , and millions more watching on television , FBR thinks it will reap enough new business to justify the investment . " We are in a business where most of our competitors are 50 , 100 or 150 years old , and people are just not aware of us , " said co-chief executive Eric Billings . " Because we have such little exposure , the golf sponsorship could help us do an enormous amount of business . " <p> 1919 Pennsylvania Ave .

Its major investments include Business Loan Express , a government-guaranteed lender to small businesses . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : Allied Capital won a legal battle last April when a federal judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of securities fraud . The lawsuit alleged Allied Capital 's financial reports included inflated valuations of some of its investments . But the judge ruled the lawsuit " establishes nothing more than that the plaintiffs disagree with some of Allied 's investment valuations .

Farmer Mac is a federally chartered enterprise created by Congress in 1988 . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : As the accounting practices of its government-sponsored cousins came under increasing scrutiny , so too did those at Farmer Mac . <p> The General Accounting Office issued a report last fall urging Farmer Mac to beef up its risk management and corporate governance practices . That mirrors criticism from Congress and elsewhere about Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , home mortgage lenders that also have an implied guarantee of government support . Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and other critics have raised concerns about the enormous cost to taxpayers should any of the enterprises stumble . <p> Each of the government-sponsored entities relies heavily on derivatives , or complex financial instruments whose value is based on an underlying asset . <p> Farmer Mac 's loan portfolio and guarantees reached $5.7 billion by the end of the year . <p> 1100 Wilson Blvd. , Suite 3000 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Founded : 1998 <p> Revenue : $80.69 million <p> Net income : $41.98 million <p> Earnings per share : $1.28 <p> Dividend : $1.65 <p> Stockholder equity : $463.95 million <p> Auditor : Ernst &; Young LLP <p> Stock : MCGC ( Nasdaq ) <p> Assets : $790.92 million <p> Market capitalization : $707.26 million <p> 52-week high : $21.49 ( 1/28/2004 ) <p> 52-week low : $9.93 ( 4/16/2003 ) <p> CEO : Bryan J.

The insurer boosted its estimate of insurance losses for 2001 , 2002 and 2003 by $5.9 million and swung to a loss of $4.2 million for the year even though revenue jumped 44 percent to more than $61 million . The company blamed the results in part on rising claims . <p> In February , a D.C. jury awarded the defunct Columbia Hospital for Women Medical Center $18.2 million in damages , agreeing with the hospital that NCRIC had overcharged for premiums and encouraged doctors to practice elsewhere . <p> NCRIC says it will appeal . The company 's viability , it says , could be threatened if the verdict is upheld and that its failure could force many of the doctors it covers to leave the District . <p> To raise money , NCRIC , which became a mutual company in 1998 owned by policyholders , converted in June into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million by selling stock to the public .
