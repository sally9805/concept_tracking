Words of comfort I really need to thank you for your wonderful April issue . As I read " New Mom , New World " by John Hoffman , I started crying - tears of relief . In the past few days , I have come to admit that I am suffering from postpartum depression . I have a wonderful husband , two beautiful daughters and terrific people surrounding me , so I struggled to believe it was true . Your article summed up how I was feeling . Then I read " Go Away , I Want Mommy ! " by Cathie Kryczka . This , too , is something we are dealing with in our family and I can not begin to say how comforting it is to read that we are not alone . I have always loved your magazine . However , this time it seems as though this particular issue was tailored just for me . I can not thank you enough ! NAME WITHHELD I HAVE TO SAY how much I enjoy John Hoffman 's column every month . He routinely provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , in " New Mom , New World , " I would have preferred to see him use the term postpartum emotional adjustments , as opposed to postpartum mood disorder . Emotional ups and downs are a normal part of adjusting to parenting , and do not need to be labelled as a disorder . I believe using the term " disorder " might , in fact , deter women from seeking help . MELLANIE SKRABEK By email Bilingual and happy RE : " Yes , Mom . Oui , Oui , Papa " ( April ) . I 'm a Canadian living in Greece and raising a bilingual preschooler . I speak English to my son despite getting many curious stares from locals , accompanied by much unsolicited advice . He 's 3 now and , until a recent trip to Montreal , would only speak to me in Greek . During the trip , he just switched over to English automatically , and we have since been having great conversations . While he sometimes uses a mlange of both Greek and English , his vocabulary in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time for him to go to school , he will again make the language adjustment based on his . environment . MARIA GIANNOUMIS Chios , Greece Daycare drought Re : " Child Care Conundrum " ( Family Room , April ) . It should n't come as a surprise that Canada ranks low in child care . As the mother of a sevenmonth-old son , I have been trying to locate a child care spot , only to be put on ridiculously long waiting lists . I am networking every chance I get to find another solution , but have so far come up empty-handed . I am considering delaying my return to work until my son is 18 months old , when I do have a spot for him at a quality licensed daycare centre , but what do I do in the meantime ? We deserve better than to have to choose between sending our child to a mediocre care situation and delaying going back to work , which for many families is n't an affordable option . KRISTAN FARLIE Bala , Ont . Mystery solved YOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now I can say it really changed our family 's life . Last fall , reading in your article " Anatomy of a Checkup " ( October 2008 ) about celiac disease was like reading about my own daughter - it prompted me to stop pushing aside my concerns and take her to the doctor . Sure enough , she was diagnosed with celiac disease in March , and is now a completely new little girl on a gluten-free diet . Thank you for your role in returning my daughter to good health and sunny spirits . ERIN NORRIS Toronto In praise of grandparents THANK YOU FOR your article " Generation Interrupted " ( April ) on grandparents raising their grandchildren . I cried reading it , as it reminded me of how selfless my grandparents were to raise my sister and me , from ages five and eight . This was a huge undertaking 25 years ago , without the support networks that are available today . As a mother now , I know what a huge sacrifice my grandparents made for us ! Never once did I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dedicated to raising us . KIM KIPPENHUCK New Hamburg , Ont . Height hassles Re : " The Shrimp " ( Steps &; Stages , March ) . My boys are the opposite of shrimps ; they are both very tall for their age . At the age of three , my son is three feet , seven inches . I realize the challenges faced by shorter kids . However , I want to point out that being too tall is also disadvantageous . My children are sometimes chastised for not acting as old as they look , and face expectations related to their size rather than their age . Height seems to be a touchy issue , but I want to balance the scale a bit ! JAYNE WILSON Fredericton Life is a workout THANKS TO Annie Game 's article " Running Late " ( April ) for taking away the guilt I had this week over cancelling my gym membership . I have n't entered my gym since before Christmas and I know I could use the $30 a month somewhere else . The article showed me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am getting a fabulous workout every day . I now feel just fine with my decision . Maryla Gallagher London , Ont . Party plates Re : " House Party " ( April ) . Thank you for the wonderful article on throwing a successful birthday party . I ca n't wait to try some of the tips as I plan my daughter 's birthday ! I love that you offered eco-friendly alternatives . However , I 'd like to comment on your suggestion about using recycled or biodegradable paper plates . Although it 's a step in the right direction , the plates still end up in landfill . I 'm buying plastic plates from dollar stores and using them at every function I host . You can get them in a variety of colours , and many are dishwasher-safe . Not only does it reduce the amount of garbage from a party , but it means our guests can enjoy their meal without worry of paper plates folding or getting soggy and breaking .
