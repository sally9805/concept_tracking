Chapter One LOOPY Songs to accompany your life : " Heart like a Raisin " ; " The Propeller Beneath My Wings " ; " Time and Time Again in a Bottle " ; " I Want to Smack Your Hand " ; " Crazy . " The children were ugly . All scabbed knees and crooked teeth , lank ponytails and greasy bangs , stained purple mouths unhinged to the uvulas . They rushed at their parents and at one another , swinging heavy backpacks , pelting chalky pebbles , kicking out with their thick institutional shoes . Lu stood away from the little clots of moms and the occasional dad , smoking a cigarette . She had quit some six months before , but when her husband told her that she would have to care for the boys all by herself for the week he was in Dallas , something thin and brittle inside her snapped . After four days with her nerves stretched colorless , smoking was the only thing keeping the cancerous thoughts from finding form on her tongue . She smashed the butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endless stream of children draining from it . She watched as stout women in teddy bear sweatshirts tenderly clasped grape-sticky kids to their bosoms . Scraps of conversation floated around her . " Britney had three hours of homework last night . What is with these teachers ? " " Is that the way you talk to me ? Is it ? You better watch that mouth ! " " I should be more patient with her . You knowthese Protestants , always going on about what the Bible says , as if anybody really knows . They do n't even believe Mary is a saint . " Lupe Klein , neither Hispanic nor Jewish , raised a Lutheran , was tempted to say , " We do n't believe anyone 's a saint . " But perhaps she was wrong . Perhaps , Lu told herself , these ugly children did beautiful , thoughtful , saintly things-splinted the broken wings of baby robins , tended to ailing grandmas and - pas , gave their last pennies to the poor . Perhaps she was too angry and shallow , too roiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps she was the wicked one . In front of her , a tall boy plucked a knot of hair from the scalp of a smaller boy . The small one smacked a palm to his head and howled as the tall one waggled the knot , its tiny white roots quivering . Christ . We 're all doomed . A woman standing next to her clucked her tongue . Lu thought it was an unconscious comment on the hair pulling , but the woman said , " Sometimes they keep them . " Who keeps who where ? " Excuse me ? " Lu said . The woman , who had spectacularly tidy hair , nodded toward the school doors . " Sometimes they keep certain classes after school . You know , if someone is pushing someone else in line , or something like that . There have been times I 've waited ten or fifteen minutes . " " Oh , " Lu said . " Right . " " I 'm Glynn , " the woman said . Lu swallowed a sigh . " Lu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Glynn smiled encouragingly , but Lu offered no more information . She had discovered very quickly that the word stepmother had a negative effect on most of the women in the school yard , and she was too fragile to risk a response . Lu was n't sure what she would say if Ms. Tidy 's face tightened , if it fell , if she said , " Really ? " and leaned in , eager for the whole sordid story . Lu was spared the small talk when Britt found her . He muttered a stiff , " Hi , " through his glittering braces and trained his eyes on his own ankles . " Hey , Britt , " Lu said , her voice sounding peppy and false . " How was your day ? " " Stupid , " he said . " Mrs. McGorney 's an asshole . " Glynn and two other moms whipped around to stare , and Lu shot them a glare that was pure overcompensation . " A lot of people are , " she said . " Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Britt bobbed his head in a way that neither agreed nor disagreed , shrugged off his backpack just as Ollie waded through the throng of plaid skirts and wrinkled uniform trousers . As usual , he was crying , his upper lip blurred with snot . His untied shoelaces flapped . " What now ? " Britt growled under his breath . Lu hushed him , though she had been thinking the same thing . She bent at the waist , bracing her hands on her knees . " What 's the matter , Ollie ? " " I forgot my pencil case , " he said , hiccuping through his tears . " My money was in it . " Ollie was wide through the cheeks and soft through the body . The only thing pointed about him was his chin , which he worked silently in his grief . Lu closed her eyes . A thousand questions coursed through her head , the answers to which , she knew , would only frustrate and annoy her . Why did you take your money to school ? Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you always insist on bringing things with you just so that you can leave them behind ? " How about we go back and get your pencil case ? " This just made Ollie cry harder . " We ca n't ! They lock all the doors and you ca n't get back in ! " " Then you 'll have to get your pencil case tomorrow . " Lu moved behind him and hefted the thirty-pound pack off his shoulders so that he could stand up straight . Ollie stamped his foot . " But what if my money gets stolen ! " " How can your money get stolen if no one can get back into the school , you freaking moron ? " Britt said . " Let 's try to be civil , shall we ? " Lu resisted , rather valiantly , she thought , the urge to smack Britt upside the head . But the insult seemed to comfort Ollie somewhat , and he wiped his nose and cheeks with the back of his hand . " Can we go to school early tomorrow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So that I can be the first to go inside ? " " I think we can do that . " At eight , Ollie still had n't quite grasped the concept of time , and Lu was sure she could convince him that they were leaving early no matter what time they left . But then she was equally sure that as soon as he saw the line of children that had , inevitably , arrived before him , he would be flattened by a fresh wave of grief , and she would have to spend fifteen minutes consoling him before he would get out of the car . Better to get up early . Ollie 's plump little hand tugged at her sleeve . " Ice cream ? " " I have soccer practice , " Britt said , face suddenly tense with alarm . " We can get ice cream and still get you to practice , " Lu said . Ice cream was soothing and peace promoting . Ice cream was magical . Ice cream was something you could use later . When you asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking you to put your dirty socks in the hamper . " But he eats so slow ! " Britt said . " Practice starts at three-fifteen ! And I still have to change ! " Ollie glowered . " I want ice cream . " " Mother fricking mother , " said Britt , drawing more glares . " I just want to get to fricking practice ! " He thrust both arms in front of him as if the boat were sinking and he had no choice but to swim for it . Lu 's tongue curled ominously around various threats , epithets , incantations , and she reached for her cigarettes . " Loopy , " said Ollie , releasing her sleeve and pinching his nose , " those make you smell . " They made it , just barely , to Britt 's practice ( " Fricking A , toad , will you stop dripping that fricking ice cream all over my fricking uniform ? " ) . All Lu wanted to do was get Ollie set up with some puzzle books so that she could sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap . She had read somewhere that stroking pets for ten minutes a day could lower blood pressure . She wanted to work her fingers in Picky 's tufted underbelly , unwind to his bumblebee buzzing , pet herself into a coma . When they got back home , however , Devin was draped facedown across the couch , stupefied by MTV , and Picky was nowhere to be found . Lu balanced an apple between Devin 's shoulder blades , sure she could count his ribs right through his T-shirt . A few months before , he 'd gone vegan . " Where 's the cat ? " " Huh ? " Devin did not take his eyes from the TV but deftly reached around and retrieved the apple , shined it on the couch cushion . " My cat , Devin . Where 's my cat ? " " Du n no , " he said . " Around . " Lu could feel the thump of bass drums in her feet . " Did you forget to turn off the stereo downstairs ? " " Shoop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shoop . " Lu dragged a hand through her snarled hair , pulling on it painfully . When she was single , she never had knots . " Do n't you think you should join him ? " " He 's okay . " Devin 's eyes narrowed , and Lu turned to the TV , only to see a teen Barbie look-alike-openmouthed and glistening with sweat-grinding her hips at the camera . She wore her tiny pink panties over her jeans . Lu blinked . Were girls wearing their panties that way now ? Had she been so traumatized by the transition from hip chick to mother hen that she had n't noticed that underwear was no longer under anything ? " Hey , Dev , what the fuck . . . " A pale and shaggy boy about Devin 's age stood in the doorway to the family room , scratching at his scalp . " Oh , sorry . I did n't know anyone else was here . " Lu was relieved to recognize his look : psycho-punk with a Gen-Z edge . Long shaggy hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devin , why do n't you go downstairs with your friend ? " Lu pointed to the soda cans , paper plates , sneakers , and other assorted litter , the slime trails of teenagers . " I 'd like to make this room more habitable for humans . " She put her hands on her hips , going for authoritative yet cool . " And please , guys , the language ? I 'd like to see if I can keep Ollie from swearing like a rap star before he 's ten . " Devin grunted and slid off the couch , grabbing one of the cans . The two boys stomped down the stairs to the basement , their reedy , warbling voices wafting up . " Who 's the chick ? " " Stepmother . " " She 's all right . You think she 'd do me ? " What the cat loves : the smell of Ward 's shoes , nail files , bathtubs , laser pointers , shrimp . What the cat hates : vacuum cleaners , thunder and lightning , the tang of citrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they were little , they were adorable . " Devin , Britt , and Ollie , " Ward had said that first date , unraveling the ready strip of photographs that all dads tote around . They were twelve , ten , and five , respectively . " Devin , Britt , and Ollie , " Lu repeated . Whatever happened to Mike ? Or John ? Images of an old puppet show she had seen when she was a kid bounced through her thoughts . Kukla , Fran and Ollie . She lifted the strip of photographs . " Kukla , " she said . " What ? " " Cute . Cute . " The boys were small , doe eyed , and elfin featured . Someone , their mother , Lu supposed , had coaxed each boy 's thick dark hair into sweet curls that would have undone Bill Sikes and Fagin alike . Ward saw them one evening a week and on weekends . Easy enough , he told Lu , because right after the divorce he had bought a house just a few blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys can just walk over . " " Great ! " said Lu , lighting a cigarette in a toast to conveniently located ex-wives . Her mother had warned her against dating divorced men , but Lu was in her mid-thirties and had just moved back to the Midwest . Who the hell else was she going to date ? To her surprise , her first meeting with the kids was so pleasantly uneventful that Lu was soon dining with Ward and his children every Wednesday , dropping by every weekend . Unlike some of the horror stories she 'd heard , the boys were always polite to her , never calling her rude names , never dismissing her out of loyalty to their mother . Of course , during their longer weekend visits , Lu was often out showing shockingly overpriced condos to wealthy people , but still , those brief visitations were comfortable and reliable as a Volvo . Then one evening-three years after they met , five months after their wedding , twelve hours after they bid on a Tudor just fifteen minutes away in historic Oak Park-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of his belongings on the porch , his mother 's car peeling away from the curb . " Devin 's all settled in high school now , " Ward said . " How can I ask him to switch , leave all his friends ? That would just upset him more than he is already . " " He stares at my breasts , Ward . " " It 's only for a few years . " " I could be dead in a few years . " It seemed to Lu that Devin had turned from an elf to a monosyllabic troll overnight . Something heavy and damp and odorous that the ex had thrown off like an old coat in a hot spell . And that was n't all she threw off . In a long and detailed letter sent with the boy , the ex announced that she could no longer take Britt to the orthodontist , citing scheduling conflicts with that office , and could no longer support Ollie 's psychotherapy , citing philosophical conflicts with modern psychology . Then there were the half days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sick days from school that she thought Ward could handle . Or perhaps Lu could help with ? " I understand , " she wrote , " that a real estate agent 's hours are quite flexible . " " Let me guess . Ontological conflicts with the concept of childhood ? Theoretical conflicts with the idea of responsibility ? " " She has to work , Lu . " The ex was marketing director at Heartland 's Best Foods , maker of Ollie 's brand wheat bread . Lu wondered which had come first , the boy or the bread . " And what am I ? Chopped liver ? " Lu said . " I am , are n't I. Lu 's Best Liver . " " Come on , Lu . I 'll take care of most of it . " Most of it ? The note had also mentioned that Britt 's history project-a diorama on the Crusades-was due on Tuesday , and he still had n't gone to the library . Lu 's hysteria mounted , and she could feel a pulse in her eyeballs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to liven up your life ! " " What am I supposed to do ? I called . I discussed . I yelled . They 're my kids , Lu . Tell me what choice I have . " She stood there in the cramped kitchen , holding a bunch of mismatched silverware that she had been planning to give to Goodwill , and wondered how she could have been so thoroughly duped . Her eyeballs kept her up at night , thrumming away into the dawn . Ollie was perched at the kitchen table , delicately licking his ice-cream cone . He ate so slowly , it had melted all over his hand . " Ollie , did you see the cat anywhere ? " " Stevie said a cat had babies under his porch . There are twenty babies . They do n't have any eyes . " " I meant Picky . Did you see Picky ? " Ollie made a face . " I saw him drinking out of the toilet bowl this morning . Why does he do that ? It 's gross . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gross , too . " " I do not pick my nose ! " Lu gave him a look and a napkin . Picky , short for Piccolo , was a little gray pelt of a thing , a tiny scrap of biology that Lu had found huddled in the bottom of a garbage can at a New York City apartment building , back in her other life . He had stopped growing at six months , retaining the size and energy of an adolescent . Though he was close to seven years old , Lu still had to pluck him from the top of the screen door , where he often got stuck , splayed like a science experiment . Picky was a living retreat for Lu , a handful of calming noises and familiar smells ( his fur was loamy and sweet , like beets ) . When she got home from work , Picky would methodically clean each of her fingertips with his tongue , sanding away the limp handshakes , defiant keys , strange doorknobs , and stained countertops . And in this crowded house full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands , Picky reminded her who she had been . Or at least reminded her that she had been someone else once . (
