DARIN ERSTAD IS ROLLING ALONG AT A PACE THAT THREATENS AN 80-YEAR-OLD RECORD // He rollled over more than Beethoven . Rolled over more than the advanced-placement class at dog-obedience school . Rolled over more than the Orange County surf . Rolled over so many times , who could possible keep count ? He could . " Seventy-two ground balls to the second baseman , " Darin Erstad says . " Fifty-eight ground balls to the first baseman . " And tell Tchaikovsky the news . It 's almost become Erstad 's mantra , his self-reminder , the number of times he saw that same pitch coming last year and did the same #%$% ! ! thing with it . He 's chanting it particularly often now when things are going so unbelievably well for the Anaheim 's Angels ' lefthanded hitting left fielder , the All-Star who 's feeling and stroking like one again . Not since Ralph " Roadrunner " Garr of the Atlanta Braves went into the 1974 All-Star break with 149 hits has a player appeared such a threat to George Sisler 's single-season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 149 hits and a .382 average in the Angels ' first 90 games , Erstad is on a pace for 265 hits . Moreover , he is batting .366 with runners in scoring position , and he has 18 home runs and 17 stteals in 22 attempts . He also has thrown out eight runners from the outfiels . " This guy , " says Ange ; s pitcher Kent Bottehfield , an eight-year veteran , " has got to be close to a league MVP . " No matter how many hits Erstad 's bat has detonatd this year-eerily , the ball is finding either grass or outfield seats as if on some computerguidance system-he reminds himself of all those weak three-hoppers to Robbie and Rndy and Thome and Tino . No matter how many times people tell him to enjoy this crazy run , urging him to crack a smile for a change , Erstad instinctively recalls all those runs from home to first with jaws and fists clenched . Always , always at full-speed . It 's just his way . " Last year 's something I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music . I was terrible . I was a mess . " A mess ? " For a year and a half , " Erstad says , " I stunk . " Hold it . If all this seems like too much dwelling in past imperfections when the present is giving us one of baseball 's most positive comeback stories , well , that 's the way Erstad would have it . Because he knows how quickly today can turn into yesterday . " I could go oh-for-the-rest-of-July , " he says during the All-Star Break . " Just like that . " Did n't happen . In his second game after the break , Erstad added another three hits , including a two-run homer off Kevin Brown that beat L.A. at Dodger Stadium . The day after that , Erstad had another multi-hit outing , his 49th in 90 games . In 195 fewer at-bats . Erstad already had surpassed his hits total ( 148 ) of 1999 . Photograph Photograph LEADING OFF : Erstad , who already has more hits than last season , is liked by teammates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's , just one of those things that 's tough to explain . " Erstad says . " I mean . I 'm , just trying to get on base It seems like there 's the same difficulty , but for some reason , the hits are falling You feel a rhythm , you find a groove and the ball finds all the holes . Not much is being caught out there . As a hitter , I 'm not going to complain . " Nearly every afternoon or night of 2000 has been bountiful. starting with a lanuary marriage to his high school sweetheart ; Sarah . Erstad , 26 , had absolutely no problem with Angels manager Terry Coffins and , his staff before last year 's firings-to the contrary , he loved their hard-nosed approach-but the hiring of Mike Scioscia finally has the Angels playing the way Erstad always knew they could . One of the first orders of business , too . was the first guy ii the . laic order . " I was given a role , ' say " Erstad , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm the leadoff hitter . I 'm the left fielder . If you want to take fly balls in left , you , better ask me . That ' my spot . It 's like shortstops have then turf . I wouid n't dream of even crossing DiSar 's ( Gar , DiS arcina 's ) path at short . He 'd tackle me . " Erstad , as a member of Nebraska 's national-championship football team of 1994. has tackled and been tackled-which made it a little too convenient for everybody to pigeonhole Erstad whom the Angels made the : first pick of the entire 1995 draft . as a baseball player with a " football mentality . " Erstad 's intensity anti competitiveness his first four years with the Angels drG nothing to refuse the motion . As he note himself , nobody ever complained about his intensity when he got off to a quick start in 1998 , only when he started making his ' ' " mess . " Photograph SAME JIM , DIFFERENT STORY Like two buddies who had n't talked in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , said hey and hugged . A couple of All-Stars hooking up in happy times . Mr. In Your Face and Mr. Stay Out of My Face wishing each other well at the All-Star Game in Atlanta . " I get along with Jimmy great , " Erstad says . " Everybody knows about him . Everybody knows about me . There are n't many secrets out there . " I want to play hard , and he can make things look easy at times . We 're not the only two people on teams that have bumped heads . I 'll take him on my team any day of the week . " Because both appear to be on their way to career years after disappointing seasons , it 's easy to downplay all of those times when they were angry Angels in the outfield . But for much of the previous two seasons in Anaheim , there was plenty of losing on the field and more than enough sniping off of it . Erstad supplied his share of the sniping , and a lot of it was aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the intensity meter . Erstad happily will spend 12 hours at the ballpark , working before and after games . He does n't like to acknowledge injuries and considers it his duty to play through them . Edmonds , as naturally gifted as anyone , has been known to tell you what 's hurting and to sit out when he does n't think he can give you enough . " Not everyone can be Darin Erstad , " Edmonds says . " He 's the guy who somehow turns it up every day with the intensity level of this being the only game he has to play this week . " Everybody else seems to behave like if 1 can get through the once-in-a-while kind of days , then I 'll be happy to go 101 percent on the others . it 's hard to play every game that hard : ' From the moment the Angels mercifully traded Edmonds to St. Louis in spring training , the laid-back Southern California native has found contentment with the Cardinals . He has been the first-place Cardinals ' best player , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catches in center field nearly every night that surpass the difficulty of the over-the-shoulder catch he made at the All-Star Game . He has missed only three games , two of those because of the flu . Never underestimate a change in scenery . " I 've been amazed at the difference in organizations , " Edmonds said . " ( Anaheim ) wanted a stereotypical ballplayer . If you look around the clubhouse , all the players do the same thing . You ca n't have that . " Instead of always trying to light a fire under Edmonds , the Cardinals have coddled him . They gave him security by quickly signing him to a six-year , $52 million contract extension and encouraging him to put roots in St. Louis . He moved into a big , colonial house " with pillars on the front , " and his two daughters have plenty of room to run around during their summer visits . " I have to like it here because I 'm going to be here seven years , " Edmonds says . " But I like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " There 's only one beat writer , " Edmonds says , and he 's not smiling . He adds , " The organization , the fans and the baseball . " In other words , a new deal , steady cheering and a sevengame lead in the division heading into this week . No need to bicker about any of that . - Stan McNeal // But Erstad also would like to downplay the football thing . " Remember , I was a punter and a placekicker , " Erstad says . " To do those things , you need to stay balm . " There is a calmness about Erstad at the plate this season that clearly was missing before , says Larry Bowa , the Seattle Mariners coach who was on the Angels staff from 1997-99 . Asked what he thought was Erstad 's low point last year , and Bowa says every day was equally painful , watching Erstad take extra batting practice and fight with himself on every pitch . " He did n't feel good about himself , not because of effort , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erstad was all out of sorts . Physically , he was having some problems , like the hamstring that put him on the disabled list in late ' ' 98 and the strained knee ligament that got him stuck on the D.L. last year . But there was other stuff on his mind , not the least of which was the memory of his schizophrenic ' ' 98 season . After making the All-Star Game with a .313 average , 18 homers and 59 runs scored , Erstad went the next year and a half hitting just .255 , with 14 homers and 76 RBIs in 754 at-bats . He struck out 101 times last season alone . And all those annoying 4-3 's and 3-unassisteds . Plus , the A.L . ' s hardest guy to double up in ' ' 98 ( once every 268.5 at-bats ) led the Angels with 16 double-play grounders . " I was rolling over on a lot of sinkers away , or there were lots of breaking balls inside that I could n't lay off , " Erstad says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go the other way , but my body was trained to pull . " When not studying video of himself-and he rivals VCR-a-holic Tony Gwynn for his use of videotape as a hitting tool-Erstad watched other hitters closely and tried to copy their techniques . During his Seattle phase , Erstad assumed the stances of Alex Rodriguez , then Edgar Martinez , then David Segui . " Did n't work , " Erstad says . " I even tried that toe  --  touching thing Sammy Sosa does . " At the same time , the team was fractured , literally and figuratively . In keeping with the franchise 's bad-voodoo history , the Angels were beset with injuries in spring training ( DiSarcina 's arm broken by a bat swung by coach George Hendrick ) and on opening day ( Mo Vaughn turning over an ankle on his first defensive play with the club ) . Jim Edmonds ' decision to put off surgery until after the season had begun vexed the whole team , but Erstad in particular . " He wo n't admit to this , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to carry the whole load , " Bowa says . " He was thinking , Well , I 'm healthy , so I 'm going to pick up for three or four guys . ' It 's hard to play the game that way . " The same inner fire that made Erstad so universally admired- " He 's the player you live and die for , the player who makes you wish you had seven or eight others just like him , " Bowa says  --  was burning him in the britches . " I 've lightened up in the time leading up to the game , done a better job of separating it , " Erstad says . " I 'm not taking it home with me . I learned to , let things go . " Where did he find this enlightenment ? " Right in the mirror , " says Erstad . " I mean , 1i did n't really look in the mirror and talk to myself , but I did do some soul-searching . I knew I could play . It was just my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees a beard more red than his hair . It 's not one of those baseball beards , the goatees that suddenly make middle-aged men think they look like ballplayers , but a real beard-the full kind that climbs down a man of winter 's throat , untrimmed . Truth be told , he looks more like a hockey player , which he was at Jamestown ( N.D. ) High . Or the ice-fisherman that he is , too . " It 's that same thing , the stubborness he has at the plate , " says Mariners lefthander Aaron Sele , a Minnesota native . " You sit there at that hole , waiting for the fish , knowing it 's got to come to you . " It has been suggested that marriage had something to do with his-gosh , you just do n't dare use the word " mellowing " around Erstad . He plays and resides parttime in Southern California , but remains North Dakota to the roots of his blond mane , fair skin and Fargo accent . Erstad shakes his head at the suggestion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so no big change there . " I do n't play catch with her , " Erstad says . " She might hurt me . " Good point . Sharp point . The man married a woman who knows how to throw a spear . Sarah was a college athlete as well , having tossed the javelin for Cornell for a while . Ballplayers may have fluke seasons , but in Erstad 's case , the " fluke " was what Vaughn called Erstad 's down year . Talk to anybody from Erstad 's past , in fact , and you 'll fmd nobody convinced that his slump would continue . By all accounts , he 's just too dedicated to his craft and too driven to succeed . " I remember sitting there many times last year , watching Darin getting balls he should 've crushed and grounding out , " says ex-teammate Chuck Finley , now with the Indians . " But I always knew he 'd work it out . Because one thing Darin ai n't afraid of is work . You can not outwork Darin Erstad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Angels , still within striking distance of both the division-leading Mariners and a wild-card spot , and Erstad has found his personal guru in live-wire coach Mickey Hatcher . Yet Erstad also says that the more time passes since hitting coach Rod Carew left , eventually to take the same job with the Brewers , the more Erstad finds himself applying Carew 's principles to his swing . That much is evident by the fact that of those first 149 hits , close to half were sent into left field , and longtime Angels observers swear they 've never seen a ball stung with such authority to the opposite field . George Sisler ? Meet Darin Sizzler . " The individual stuff just does n't do much for me , " says Erstad , flinching at every mention of Sisler 's name and any talk of the record . " If the choice was between me hitting .400 and us not making the playoffs by a game , I 'd take us making the playoffs , any time . " If I 'm hitting .399 on my last at-bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I 'll put a grounder to the right side . " The rollover of choice , the rollover that counts .
