Prologue WEARING A BROWN TWEED SUIT and his customary dark tortoiseshell sunglasses , Dr. Alberto Mazzini pushed through the crowd of loud and agitated reporters blocking the steps of the Muse d'Histoire in Bore . " Can you tell us about the artifact ? Is it real ? Is that why you 're here ? " a woman pressed , shoving a microphone marked CNN in his face . " Have tests been performed on the DNA ? " Dr. Mazzini was already annoyed . How had the press jackals been alerted ? Nothing had even been confirmed about the find . He waved off the reporters and camera operators . " This way , Docteur , " one of the museum aides instructed . " Please , come inside . " A tiny dark-haired woman in a black pantsuit was waiting for Mazzini inside . She looked to be in her mid-forties and appeared to almost curtsy in the presence of this prestigious guest . " Thank you for coming . I am Rene Lacaze , the director of the museum . I tried to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They smell a big story . It is as if we 've found an atom bomb . " " If the artifact you 've found turns out to be authentic , " Mazzini replied flatly , " you will have found something far greater than a bomb . " As the national director of the Vatican Museum , Alberto Mazzini had lent the weight of his authority to everyimportant find of religious significance that had been unearthed over the past thirty years . The etched tablets presumed to be from the disciple John dug up in western Syria . The first Vericotte Bible . Both now rested among the Vatican treasures . He had also been involved in the investigation of every hoax , hundreds of them . Rene Lacaze led Mazzini along the narrow fifteenth-century hall inlaid with heraldic tile . " You say the relic was unearthed in a grave ? " Mazzini asked . " A shopping mall . . . " Lacaze smiled . " Even in downtown Bore , the construction goes night and day . The bulldozers dug up what must have once been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a couple of the sarcophagi split open . " Ms. Lacaze escorted her important guest into a small elevator and then up to the third floor . " The grave belonged to some long-forgotten duke who died in 1098 . We did acid and photo-luminescence tests immediately . Its age looks right . At first we wondered , why would a precious relic from a thousand years earlier , and half the world away , be buried in an eleventh-century grave ? " " And what did you find ? " Mazzini asked . " It seems our duke actually went to fight in the Crusades . We know he sought after relics from the time of Christ . " They finally arrived at her office . " I advise you to take a breath . You are about to behold something truly extraordinary . " The artifact lay on a plain white sheet on an examiner 's table , as humble as such a precious thing could be . Mazzini finally removed his sunglasses . He did n't have to hold his breath . It was completely taken away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look closely . There is an inscription on it . " The Vatican director bent over it . Yes , it could be . It had all the right markings . There was an inscription . In Latin . He squinted close to read . " Acre , Galilee . . . " He examined the artifact from end to end . The age fit . The markings . It also corresponded to descriptions in the Bible . Yet how did it come to be buried here ? " All this , it does not really prove anything . " " That 's true , of course . " Rene Lacaze shrugged . " But Docteur . . . I am from here . My father is from the valley , my father 's father , and his . There have been stories here for hundreds of years , long before this grave tumbled open . Stories every schoolchild in Bore was raised on . That this holy relic was here , in Bore , nine hundred years ago . " Mazzini had seen a hundred purported relics like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnerved him . A reverent force gave him the urge to kneel on the stone floor . Finally , that 's what he did - as if he were in the presence of Jesus Christ . " I waited until your arrival to place a call to Cardinal Perrault in Paris , " said Lacaze . " Forget Perrault . " Mazzini looked up , moistening his dry lips . " We are going to call the Pope . " Alberto Mazzini could n't take his eyes off the incredible artifact on the plain white sheet . This was more than just the crowning moment of his career . It was a miracle . " There 's just one more thing , " said Ms. Lacaze . " What ? " Mazzini mumbled . " What one more thing ? " " The local lore , it always said a precious relic was here . Just never that it belonged to a duke . But to a man of far more humble origins . " " What sort of lowborn man would come into such a prize ? A priest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacaze 's brown eyes widened . " Actually , a jester . " Veille du Pre , a village in southern France , 1096 The church bells were ringing . Loud , quickening peals - echoing through town in the middle of the day . Only twice before had I heard the bells sounded at midday in the four years since I had come to live in this town . Once , when word reached us that the King 's son had died . And the second , when a raiding party from our lord 's rival in Digne swept through town during the wars , leaving eight dead and burning almost every house to the ground . What was going on ? I rushed to the second-floor window of the inn I looked after with my wife , Sophie . People were running into the square , still carrying their tools . " What 's going on ? Who needs help ? " they shouted . Then Antoine , who farmed a plot by the river , galloped over the bridge aboard his mule , pointing back toward the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " From the east , I heard the loudest chorus of voices , seemingly raised as one . I squinted through the trees and felt my jaw drop . " Jesus , I 'm dreaming , " I said to myself . A peddler with a cart was considered an event here . I blinked at the sight , not once but twice . It was the greatest multitude I had ever seen ! Jammed along the narrow road into town , stretching out as far as the eye could see . " Sophie , come quick , now , " I yelled . " You 're not going to believe this . " My wife of three years hurried to the window , her yellow hair pinned up for the workday under a white cap . " Mother of God , Hugh . . . " " It 's an army , " I muttered , barely able to believe my eyes . " The Army of the Crusade . "                   @ @
