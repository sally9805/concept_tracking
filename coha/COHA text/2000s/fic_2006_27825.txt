What It Used to Be Like A Portrait of My Marriage to Raymond Carver By Carver , Maryann Burk St. Martin 's Press Carver , Maryann Burk Spudnuts and Roses As the summer of 1955 began I was almost fifteen . I lived in Union Gap -- a little town to the south of Yakima , Washington -- and in June I was hired to waitress at a shop that sold spudnuts . It was my first real job . I was so wound up the first morning that I bought a pack of cigarettes on the way in . I had n't smoked in months , not since March when I left public school to attend a private one . I went into the bathroom of the local Texaco station and made myself sweetly dizzy as I lit and inhaled a Pall Mall fresh out of the new red package . Then I chewed some Juicy Fruit to get rid of the smell on my breath . Then I ditched the gum . At Saint Paul 's School for Girls we learned that ladies do not chew gum in public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Ness , and Ella , another waitress . In her early forties , she was a tall , still-pretty Southern belle who loved to feed her sweet tooth with glazed spudnuts . ( Spudnuts , by the way , are like doughnuts , except made from potato flour and more delicious . ) Old Mr. Ness had supposedly bought the business for his son . But he so loved tyrannizing everybody -- lording it at the sink full of dirty dishes , getting in the way ofcustomers ' orders , and supervising our every move -- that he had n't gotten around to turning over the managerial reins . I soon learned that only when he 'd left for the day could Ella and I relax . When the coast was clear , straight into the jukebox went some of my hard-earned tips , five plays for a quarter . First I 'd get Al Hirt from New Orleans going with his trumpet . Customers would turn their heads and smile . Then I 'd play Nat " King " Cole 's " A Blossom Fell " or Al Hibbler 's beautiful " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Apple Blossom White " from Latin mambo king Prez " Prez " Prado . One bright , sunny day the bell on the shop door rang out . A tall , dark curly-haired young man walked in . I happily went over to wait on the good-looking guy . Suddenly I had a strange feeling . As he looked at me , I thought with calm , powerful certainty , I am going to marry this boy . He did n't seem aware of anything unusual . We smiled at each other . I found out he liked spudnuts and was addicted to Pepsi Cola . He ordered . I served him his order . We smiled some more . The next day he was back . I had been hoping he would be , sensing as teenage girls can that he might be attracted to me . He came in and sat at a table . Ella saw him and looked as if she was going over to wait on him . So I hurried to get his order and practically bowled her aside in my haste . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawl . I stopped short , surprised -- she 'd always spoken charmingly to me . " I 'll wait on him , Maryann . " She explained : " That 's my son , Raymond . I need to talk to him . " Oh . What a difference a day makes . Yesterday the boy was a handsome stranger from out of nowhere , like a knight-errant . Because , you see , he was destined to be my champion and marry me . Today , as any idiot could tell , he was simply stopping by to see his mother . Cancel the wedding plans . Hold the honeymoon . My other immediate thought -- What was wrong with me ? I stood still a long minute . But I trusted my intuition and chose not to let my total embarrassment paralyze me . I just knew fate was at work here . Then it struck me -- damn , I 've already met my future mother-in-law . I looked over at Ella , who was chatting with her son and ( little did she know ) my future husband . I learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks , and endless Pepsis . He had a summer job in a grocery store down the street . He was two years older than I. And he had the nicest manners , the best of any boy I 'd ever met . Ray did n't call his mother " the old lady " or his father " the old man " the way a lot of teens flippantly did out of earshot . He referred to them as " Mom " and " Dad " or " my folks . " I thought he was proud of his family , respectful , as I was of mine . He still went on family picnics and outings . I felt that he was a confident , mature person who was n't ashamed of his background or upbringing . One day while we were talking at the Spudnut , I asked him whom he loved the most in all the world . Without hesitating he said , " My dad . I love my dad the most . " He was proud to be named after his father , I think simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes called Junior , his given and middle names were reversed : he was Raymond Clevie and his dad was Clevie Raymond . The reversal was apparently a birth certificate foul-up and not his parents ' intention . Both father and son were called Raymond at home and the right one would always answer when Ella or James , Ray 's brother , called , although anyone else could n't hear the difference . What Ray came to hate was being called Junior by his extended family . His stubborn resistance eventually forced everyone to drop the habit . He was never Junior after that . My summer days were settling into regular routines . After work I 'd still be dancing in my head to exotic jukebox rhythms as I headed over to the grocery store to check for the latest True Story or Modern Romance . I could buy what I wanted now that I was old enough to have a job -- but felt youthfully guilty about some of my choices . ( So I hid the " trash " from my mother . ) At the same time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading list for students , from Norah Lofts 's Bless This House to classics like Joseph Conrad 's Nigger of the Narcissus . I felt entitled to read whatever I craved . Waitressing at eighty-five cents an hour -- close to minimum wage in 1955 -- I could finally buy the Jantzen sweaters and Pendleton skirts and jackets I wanted for school . I made a list of coordinated outfits , the " civilian clothes " I could wear when we students shed the uniforms that our Episcopalian boarding school required . Number one on my fall list : a white Jantzen skirt and sweater , red belt , red shoes , red purse , and round red earrings with centered clusters of rhinestones . I just loved clothes . And I loved going to my job . Or at least I did until the morning when Mr. Ness made one too many petty jabs at Ella . She was in the middle of dishwashing . Ella whirled on him , fire blazing in her eyes : " I believe I 've washed more dishes in my life than you have ! I 'm tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time ! " She told the dumbfounded old man that he was welcome to the damn dishes , ripped off her apron , and sailed out the door . Gone . I was stunned , but thoroughly awestruck . My mother , who was a teacher , did everything according to Hoyle , especially when she changed jobs . I admired Ella 's spunk . Then it sank in -- I 'd have to handle the shop all on my own that afternoon . A further panicky rush of thoughts engulfed me . I was convinced that Ray would never come back . Why should he ? His mom was n't here . He could get his Pepsis other places . I 'd never see him again . The next day I watched the entire eight hours of my shift for Ray . He did n't stop by . My heart sank . The following day it was the same , and I reproached myself for having made something out of nothing . The mutual attraction I was so sure of was a figment of my girlish romantic imagination . Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn . Get over it . More fish in the ocean . Sure . Then Ray came into the Spudnut . I could n't believe how overjoyed I was . But I acted cool , or tried to . I strolled out from behind the counter . There was another customer I had to wait on . Ray stood in my path , not a lot of open space to maneuver between the tables . Without any special recognition I went to cross behind him . I do n't know why , but I impulsively stepped closer . Close enough to touch and faintly graze my breasts on his back . He stiffened and leaned into me , pinning me for an instant , though it felt as if I were frozen and on display for a short eternity . I had shocked myself down to my toenails ! My face burning , I broke away and all but ran to the back room , where I tried to compose myself . He 's just another guy , I told myself . What am I to him ? Just some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be cool . Be cool , I told myself . . . . Oh Lord , I 'd left the other customer sitting there ! I had to go back ! Or risk losing my job . What a fiasco . But I needed to keep my job . Resolute ( barely ) , armed with my order pad and a smile , I went back out to face whatever fate had in store for me . Spudnuts , anyone ? Despite my self-conscious meltdown , Ray kept coming in to see me . I could tell he really liked me , but I started to wonder if the summer would end before he 'd ever ask me out . I shocked myself once again by asking him , out of the blue , if he 'd like to do something -- us , together , somewhere , not the Spudnut ? Well , the next day he was going fishing with his uncle Fred . They 'd be gone for a week . " That 's why I have n't asked you out , " Ray clarified . " I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than usual . Nine days later he was back . But he 'd been thinking about me out in the wilds and had come up with a plan . We could go to the drive-in . The one where teens from several Washington counties converged every night . Okay ? Okay . He drove up to my house in his dad 's gray sedan , a ' 50 Chevrolet . I was ready . I dashed out wearing my black cotton skirt splashed with vivid swaths of pastels and a sleeveless rose-colored blouse . I was laughing to myself as I realized Ray had never seen me out of my waitress uniform . But now , now he sure saw me . In a blur we were on our way . At the drive-in we sat close together in the car . I was so nervous that my hands were wet with perspiration . The double feature that night had Blackboard Jungle first up . There was a girl in it who looked and danced ( I decided later ) a lot like me . I was so excited to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clock "  - -  by somebody named Bill Haley and the Comets . Customers had told me about this new music that was called rock and roll . As the movie ran , Ray moved closer and put his arm around my shoulders . I felt both awkward and thrilled . Who needed to read romance magazines ? This was the real thing . At intermission I excused myself and went to the girls ' room in the snack bar . As I threaded my way back between the parked cars in the dark , I got the usual crude remarks from faceless guys : " Hey , girl , over here ! " " Shake it , but do n't break it ! " By the time I was back , the second feature had already begun . Ray opened the door for me . He had begun to get worried and apologized for not escorting me to the snack bar . I felt a rush of gratitude and , unexpectedly , felt so very comfortable to be with him . After the experience of what to my mind was a creepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( My magazines hinted at the perils lurking at the drive-in . ) As I flashed again on all those half-open car doors and the leering comments , I thought , It feels good to be home . When Ray later dropped me off at home , he kissed me good night . I made a mental note to myself -- oh my God , tonight Ray kissed me for the first time . Another sign we were destined for each other . I was amazed that my dreams and reality were magically becoming one . After work the next day , Ray picked me up in the car . We drove up South First Street in the sweltering heat , past Layman 's Market with the huge containers out front of cantaloupes and watermelons . Next came a motley jumble of small restaurants and seedy taverns until Union Gap was left behind us . Then we drove north as far as the Triple-X Drive-In restaurant on the outskirts of Yakima ( the big city of forty thousand or so ) . We stopped , ordered food . When it came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey . " He said " honey " just like my brother-in-law , Les Bonsen , did to his wife , Jerry . She was my older sister . The word hung in the air . It felt like a commitment . For years afterward , whenever we were doing some ordinary task like washing the dishes or the like and Ray happened to say " honey , " I would remember how thrilled I was on that hot afternoon in Yakima when he said it the first time . I 'd remember the sweet expression on his face . From then on we had to see each other every day . When Ray came into the Spudnut , it was hard for me to take my eyes off him and do my work . We would happily smile away at each other for no reason at all , and talk at my breaks or when there were n't any customers . Ray also liked to smoke . I asked him how long he 'd been doing it . " A couple of years now . " I could tell by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . He was pretty well hooked . I knew smoking hurt my lungs . The pain had stopped when I was at Saint Paul 's , where it was n't permitted . But cigarette in hand and drinking a Pepsi , Ray was as handsome and sophisticated as a guy in a TV ad , the sort who wore those heavy-framed dark glasses while cool jazz played . In July , Ray took me on long drives north of Yakima over the dry rolling hills toward Ellensburg . Or we 'd drive to the west on Tieton Drive . That 's where the great orchards were , those miles and miles of apple , cherry , apricot , peach , and plum trees that had made Yakima the self-declared " fruit bowl of the nation . " One afternoon out on Tieton , we talked animatedly about how much fun it would be to travel someday . We could go places that fascinated us . Imagine -- to the Middle East where civilization began and modern politics made it a powder keg . Or to Europe to see art in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Or even to Russia to walk where Napoleon desperately tried to win against the czar 's troops and the Russian winter . We knew about foreign places only from reading . Ray loved books as much as I did . That really surprised me . We both read several hours a day , always a book out of the library in progress . Few other teens we knew liked to read at all . Spend precious free time buried in some book ? Kids who did got called bookworms . But our shared passion meant that Ray and I could n't have cared less what anybody thought of us . When he was younger , Ray had read all of Edgar Rice Burroughs several times over . ( " You Tarzan , me Jane , " I had to tease . ) His voice rose with enthusiasm as he told me about Burroughs . Ray clearly revered these books . And Buck Rogers . Ray had read everything in the series . Now he was busy with science fiction and fat historical novels by popular authors like Thomas B. Costain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished reading Costain 's The Silver Chalice . ) We discovered we were both enthralled with history . Again this was a wonder . No one we knew in public school could stand history , much less respond to it as we did . Ray was captivated by stories of Alexander the Great and knew all about his military campaigns . I had studied ancient history a year earlier , and before I knew it I was telling him about the Fertile Crescent and Hammurabi 's code of law . That tumbled into a discussion of the Spanish Armada and the invasion of England . " In 1588 Queen Elizabeth I was triumphant over Philip II of Spain because she was so intelligent . No one expected a woman to have brains . Well , she showed them ! " " Of course having the British navy at her disposal did n't hurt either , " Ray retorted . I laughed . Then I asked him abruptly , " Ray , what would you like to do when you 're older ? You would be a fantastic history teacher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoring students . He nodded , unexpectedly serious . " I 'm going to be a writer , Maryann . A writer like Ernest Hemingway . In fact , I 'm going to be such a great writer , I 'll be able to flip the bone to the world . " He raised his hand , middle finger skyward . My heart was pounding . This was the most exciting thing I had ever heard in my life . Conviction ringing in my voice , I said , " Ray , I 'll help you ! " Our eyes locked . It was a pact . Trusting me more , Ray began to reveal other things about himself . But he was not easily forthcoming . Quite the contrary -- he had private issues that took a long time before I knew much about them . I had no idea yet that from childhood on he 'd had a serious weight problem . The year before we met , Ray finally made himself diet . Unlike the plans imposed on him by his mother or the family doctor , this worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking , which took the place of food . His fat-boy childhood had affected his personality and values . Always he sympathized with the underdog and the afflicted . However , for him it was important never to be called fat again . As for a wife -- however smart , talented , or accomplished -- she would also have to be a real trophy . When I eventually realized this need of Ray 's , I was a little taken aback . My mother had always told me that physical beauty was skin deep . Good character counted for much more ( and besides it was something you had control over ) . Already I sensed that Ray wanted me to be a real showcase lady -- and so I would be . He was always making sure I ate enough . At Mooney 's Drive-In everybody wolfed down huge , trademark burgers ; when we went there Ray urged me to eat . ( I felt self-conscious , not hungry . ) He wanted me to look " just right , " slender but not too thin , because he did n't want his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when somebody said I looked like Ava Gardner or Audrey Hepburn , those slim beauties and consummate movie stars of the day . On the other hand there was more to me than my looks . Ray knew it and never belittled my abilities . This was just the way we were together , fifties attitudes about women notwithstanding . He really listened when I explained to him what Saint Paul 's meant to me . " I go to Saint Paul 's instead of public school ' cause it 's college preparatory . The girls there like to read and study . " Truly I thought the twelve girls in my class were all first rate , stimulating and challenging . After what I 'd faced in public school my new classmates had come as a great relief . These were the sort of girlfriends I wanted to have . Unlike in my public school , I was n't made to feel unfeminine or ashamed because I openly loved to learn . I may have been an A and B student at Saint Paul 's , but I had classmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merit Scholarship winners . ) Most came from very wealthy families with every educational advantage . As I saw it I was vying with the best , and that made it far more difficult to get really high grades . Only with my older sister , Jerry 's , help had it been possible for me to go to Saint Paul 's . I was completely grateful . I wanted to become a lawyer ; I had ever since I was eight . So I worked very hard at my studies , as I would have to qualify for a college scholarship . After my fervid explanations I waited for Ray to say something . " Oh , that 's why you go there , " he finally said . " My mother told me you went to some school in Walla Walla . But she thought it must be a reform school . " He laughed . " I did n't want to ask . " When he saw my hurt look , he quickly added , " That 's the only reason Mom 's ever heard for going away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally said , with what I hoped was patience for his misinformed opinion . " It 's like a reform school , sure , but the opposite of what your mom was thinking . Saint Paul 's is a finishing school . " And I certainly meant for Ray Carver to realize yet again what a special girl he had . Continues ... by Carver , Maryann Burk
