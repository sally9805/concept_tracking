// Nicole Johnson , Miss America 1999 and an international spokeswoman for diabetes issues for the past five years , introduces her Web site as follows : " Thank you for visiting my Web site . " The last several years of my life have been dedicated to the fight against diabetes . My hope is that this Web site will serve as an educational resource for you and will inspire you to join this cause . " The goal of my fight against diabetes is both to find a cure and to inform patients of opportunities for better care and treatment . There are so many ways you can get involved in programs-from " Advocacy " through " Take the Lead " to volunteering with one of the diabetes organizations to financial support . We need your help . Again , thank you for visiting and keep fighting diabetes . " Over the past eight years , Nicole has worked tirelessly promoting awareness , prevention and early detection of the " hidden killer , " diabetes . She has not been limited to public speaking ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D.C. lobbying the U.S. Congress on behalf of diabetes issues . In addition , she also works with state legislatures to improve insurance coverage and general health care for the millions of individuals with diabetes . Another of Nicoles passions is diabetes research . Over the last several years she has helped generate more than $16 million for this cause . Beyond these activities and achievements , Nicole has written her autobiography , Living With Diabetes , and collaborated on two cookbooks . The autobiography details Nicole 's journey through life with diabetes , her achievement of Miss America and the tests that have been placed on her faith and foundation along the way . TH : Nicole , welcome to totalhealth . Your being a former Miss America , I would appreciate your thoughts regarding the possibility of eliminating the talent , along with any mention of platform issues , from this year 's Miss America telecast . NJ : The TV network and producers of the show are trying too hard to make it hip and modern . They are n't looking at the beauty of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily the women who might win Miss America , really sad . It has been two and a half months since the information leaked out so who knows what will happen . I was enraged because during that time period I was diagnosed with diabetes and had enough fire and vigor to become involved with the Miss America program so I could talk about a cause . TH : Yes , and I guess we do n't need role models any more do we ? NJ : That 's the darndest thing about it , but that 's how it sounds does n't it ? TH : I was under the impression that type I diabetes was a childhood onset disease . NJ : I was diagnosed with type I diabetes at 19 . Type I has been commonly referred to as juvenile diabetes . However we have begun to change that terminology . Over the past decade or so scientists have realized there are thousands of people who were misdiagnosed . When they came in at 35 or 40 with the symptoms of diabetes , it was assumed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on weight loss programs and prescribing oral medications . However those individuals moved rapidly to needing insulin . What we began to realize was that certain people have a genetic susceptibility or predisposition to type I diabetes , that can be triggered by an environmental factor at any point in life . As I mentioned , I was first diagnosed at 19 . It is also important to understand that being diagnosed does n't necessarily correlate with the onset of the disease , which could have been active for years prior to the diagnosis . Over the past several years my younger brother , who is now 28 , and I have participated in a research study . We both have the same genetic predisposition for diabetes . However , he has not contracted the disease . It is assumed at some juncture I came in contact with a virus that triggered my condition . However , it ca n't be proven as a fact . It may have been a virus I encountered in college . Who knows . Maybe if I had gotten more sleep or been healthier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way to know . TH : Over the past decade America has seen an alarming increase in type II diabetes in both adults and children as well as deaths from diabetes . Is this directly related to the endemic obesity and sedentary lifestyles of our citizenry ? NJ : Typically yes . The way it is most easily described is when an individual has type II diabetes , his or her body produces the insulin needed to counteract their glucose intake naturally . An imbalance in diet or activity levels can affect the body 's ability to metabolize nutrients by using its own insulin to process glucose effectively . Oral medication can be prescribed to reduce weight by 10 , 20 or 30 pounds and hopefully bring the process back into balance . However , at some point in time , the body loses it capability to utilize its own insulin and injections or a pump become necessary . TH : When an individual has a blood test during a regular physical , are they tested for diabetes ? NJ : They are supposed to be . However there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates they may have diabetes but they are not diagnosed . On average , over the 18 million people in the U.S. who have diabetes , about 16 million have type II . Most people with type II live with the condition nine to 12 years before they are even diagnosed . TH : Wow . How many people would you estimate are currently living with diabetes that has n't been diagnosed ? NJ : Between six and nine million . TH : Are these individuals at high risk for serious health problems during this period of time ? NJ : Absolutely . The way most of these individuals are diagnosed is when they manifest one of the secondary conditions which are brought on as a result of the diabetes . For instance , a heart attack or stroke , loss of feeling in the feet or a blister on the foot that does n't heal over an extended period to time . These problems are often how an individual finds out they are diabetic . Unfortunately this means either medical professionals are n't holding up their end of the bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population just is n't taking the initiative to get regular checkups . TH : Let 's go back to when you were 19 and found out you had diabetes . Is that when you began to pursue information about your own condition ? How might you help other individuals gain an awareness of what needs to be done to deal with their conditions . NJ : Prior to that point in my life my goal was to become a journalist . My intended career path was oriented toward being a TV reporter or a news anchor . I continued to pursue these interests for a couple of years after being diagnosed . However , when I was diagnosed , a change began to slowly happen in my heart and my mind . I was diagnosed during the beginning of my second year of college . While I was in the hospital , they told me I needed to drop out of school , that I would never graduate from college , and other absurd things . So I followed the orders and dropped out of the university and decided to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of my condition . After a few weeks I could n't take it any longer . I had to be active again . I enrolled in nursing school . Well that lasted for three months and then I returned to pursue my English and journalism degree . But I was so impacted by being diagnosed with a chronic condition and learning about how to care for myself and others that my outlook on life changed . By the time I wound up in the Miss America competition , my number one goal was to become a diabetes advocate and to help rid society of discrimination as it relates to people with medical conditions . My secondary goal was to become a journalist so that I could gain the visibility to be an effective advocate for diabetes awareness . Little did I expect to be named Miss America and then immediately be thrust into this field I continue to pursue . So the long and the short of it is that I truly was changed as an individual by my diagnosis and by my condition . Actually I often argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel grateful for the blessing of living with a chronic disease even though , gosh , I 'd give anything in the world to have it taken away . But also I would not trade the experience for anything because the education , the personal growth and the character development have been tremendous . TH : I am sure it has also been a blessing to the universe of individuals with who you share your message in helping them understand their condition , how to live with it and contribute to the greater community in spite of it . Please give me your definition of an advocate . NJ : Anyone who has a voice or a pen . We are all built to be an advocate for something and it 's up to us to use the tools that God has given us . Whether it is our voice or written words , we all have a heart and a mind that can conceive of ways to make a positive impact on peoples lives . Whether it is advocating for the government , a cause like the American Diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step-children in helping them learn to read or understand their math homework and helping them learn how to be contributing members of society . So it 's all in your actions towards others . An advocate is someone who makes the effort to take a positive action . TH : You work with children who have diabetes , you have a newsletter , you have written two cookbooks and an autobiography , you have raised $16 million for diabetes research , you have a terrific Web site ( www.nicole-johnson.com ) , you are a congressional advo- cate and an active national voice for the American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) . It must be quite a task to create a balance between the demands of those activities and the responsibilities of an active family life . NJ : It is very challenging in terms of my pro- fession . I often describe what I do as a three-legged stool . One leg is the journalism , the love of communication that has been ingrained in me for some time . Also the books and the articles and the Web site that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates to the public speaking and the education that I do for the kids , speaking to medical professionals and lay persons who want to learn about diabetes and caregivers who want to learn how to motivate the person they are caring for . The third leg is the government work . I do a good deal of consulting for a number of health oriented organizations , including the ADA . Also about twice a month I drive to Washington , D.C. to meet with various congressmen , senators and administrative officials trying to emphasize to them the importance of looking into various medical programs , whether it is funding research or education programs or helping to end discrimination in the workplace . You 're right , it is very hard to balance and delegate my time . But I have a great group of people who help me keep things organized and a wonderful supportive husband and three terrific step-children . When my husband is done with his day job , he joins in and loves to give his input . Even the kids have gotten involved in our fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while there is not much separation from my personal life and my professional life , I am really excited about the way it seems to work for all of us . After eight years of living by myself with almost a total dedication to diabetes awareness , learning how to close my office and spend time with other important people in my life has been a wonderfully rewarding experience . TH : With all the research currently underway , do you see a cure for diabetes in the near future ? NJ : I am very optimistic about the future and enthusiastic about the research that is happening now , but it is going to be many , many years . Hopefully it will be in my lifetime . My greatest hope is that my children 's children wo n't even know what diabetes is , that we will have gotten rid of it . Will it happen ? I 'm not sure . Possibly not , in terms of how our society is functioning now . Our general approach to nutrition and physical activity is just abysmal . The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in type I because that is where we have this genetic situation which is being researched currently . Unfortunately we just do n't know what is causing it in people 's bodies . We probably wo n't find an overall cure for it because if we continue to be a society that is sedentary and continues to overeat , then we are going to have type II diabetes . The most sobering statistic I can give you is that right now about 10 percent of our society is diabetic . If we continue on the path we are following , in five years that figure will grow to 12 percent and continue to get larger and larger . TH : What is on your personal horizon at this point ? NJ : My goal in diabetes at this point in time is trying to find creative and innovative ways to help people live well . That is everything from advocacy , which we talked about , to writing books and articles . Also we just finished a pilot for a television show which talks about healthy living and healthy lifestyles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exercising while you are watching TV . It is starting on a network station here in Pittsburgh and hopefully will be syndicated on the networks across the country . It is exciting . I am also the constant student . One of the wonderful opportunities afforded by winning Miss America was the scholarship money . Now I am about to utilize the last portion of the money I received to get a public health degree , so that hopefully I can combine my master 's in journalism with a master 's in public health to broaden the vistas of how to impact people 's lives and effect positive change .
