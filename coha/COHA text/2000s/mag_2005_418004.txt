Your kids notice everything you do . Here 's how to inspire good behavior , healthy habits , and more-without driving yourself crazy // " FINGERS OUT , DAVEY ! " I SAY . MY 4-YEAR-OLD IS riding behind me in his car seat , sucking on two fingers , and my usual lecture is about to start . I 'll warn him about the germs he 's swallowing and the buckteeth he 'll develop . I 'll probably even mention the awful night brace Uncle Barr had to wear as a kid because he sucked his thumb . But first things first : We 're at a stoplight , and I have a hangnail that 's driving me nuts . As I begin to chew it off , I glance in the rearview to see Davey watching me . Of course he puts his fingers in his mouth ! How could he not , when this is my idea of a manicure . Child see , child do . As any parent knows , our kids instinctively copy us , from the way we walk and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one sitting . We may worry about those less-than-ideal habits-but let 's pause for a reality check : Nobody 's perfect . In fact , it 's probably good for kids to see us tumble from our pedestals now and then . " I want my daughters to learn it 's okay to mess up , " says Melissa Gillis of New York City , mom of Lily , 3 , and Emma , 1 . " They should know that I make mistakes , that I admit them and try to do better next time-and that this is being human . " So if your child catches you being , um , human , do n't kick yourself . Just resolve to set the best example you can . These parent-tested ideas may help . pick your priorities It can be overwhelming to think about all the wonderful habits you want your child to have , and how best to model them . But you 'll inspire plenty of fine behavior if you just choose a few principles close to your heart-say , generosity , honesty , and kindness-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clinical child psychologist in Penfield , New York . The dad of two boys , 11 and 9 , he says , " I can demonstrate generosity when I 'm driving , for instance , and point out , " That person really wants to get in my lane ; I think I 'll let him in. ' ' " make sure your child 's watching You may devour books the way other people devour brownies , but your kids ca n't mirror you if you read only when they 're asleep . So be obvious about the habits and values you want to pass down . Even better , turn them into a family affair . Bike with your children or bounce alongside them to an exercise video . Designate a family sketching hour on Sunday afternoons . Hug your spouse in plain view , then do a group embrace for good measure . Gretchen Distler has her daughters , Alanah , 9 , and Iris , 6 , help her compost their yard in Blacksburg , Virginia . And Mitchell and Lisa Cronig of Shaker Heights , Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy , 8 , a sense of charity by taking them along to donate clothes and toys , and including them in the Jewish custom of saving money for charities in a tzedakah box they keep in their living room . clean up your act ... What if you want your kids to eat healthfully and be polite , but you 're hooked on M &Ms; and swear like a truck driver ? Often , the most reliable way to ditch a bad habit is to replace it with a good one . Take Carol Laurino of Dedham , Massachusetts . Instead of snacking while she watches TV with Alec , 4 , and Connor , 3 , she has started lifting weights . ( Alec is so inspired that she 's had to make " weights " for him from paper towel rolls . ) And instead of yelling at road hogs when she 's driving , Laurino focuses on her breathing . She 's even taught herself some G-rated expletives , which are catching on in her family . Alec-who used to vent by repeating his parents ' old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiddlesticks ! " " I am far from slender , and I do n't like what I see in the mirror , " Distler says . But she does n't want her daughters ever to obsess about their own weight . So instead of saying , " This outfit makes me look so fat , " she 's learned to say , " I do n't feel comfortable in this . " ... and your partner 's act Not long ago , Davey belched at the dinner table . Trying to prompt a polite " excuse me , " I asked him , " What does Daddy say when he burps ? " Davey 's immediate reply : " He says , " BORK ! ' ' " Uh-oh . If you need to suggest a role-model remodel , many parents I spoke to recommend bringing up a bad habit without the kids around and focusing on the effect it has on the children . Anne Aberbach of Paradise Valley , Arizona , mother of Jordan , 9 , and Olivia , 6 , says her husband , Steve Lee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without realizing it , I 'll say in front of the kids that I did something stupid , or I 'll criticize my own appearance . Later , when we 're alone , Steve says , " Where do you think they get it when they talk about themselves negatively ? ' ' " says Aberbach . " And he 's right . So I try to do better . " Following up with brief coded reminders in front of the kids ( " Honey ! Etiquette alert ! " ) has helped at my house . My husband 's burps are still loud enough to set off car alarms , but he does excuse himself afterward. be sneaky about your vices If there 's something that you ca n't bear to give up , indulge discreetly . Read that trashy magazine when the kids are at Grandma 's ; listen to Howard Stern on headphones instead of on the stereo . Master the art of secret snacking at home . ( But beware : Kids notice a lot more than you think . Once , while Davey was playing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , licked the evidence from my teeth , and drank some water for good measure . Minutes later , he said , " Mommy , can I have a mothball , too ? " ) find a surrogate role model Distler , who 's nervous about swimming in the river near her family 's home ( she 's squeamish about the catfish lurking on the bottom , but has n't let on about her feelings to her daughters ) , counts on her mom and husband to model what she ca n't : fearless frolicking in the current . " The girls have always been willing to go in the river because there 's somebody they trust who 'll do it , too . " see the op in oops ... When you slip up in front of your kids , look on the bright side , says Mitchell : It 's a teaching moment . Have they just heard you bickering with your spouse ? Then it 's important to hear you reach an agreement . Have they seen you standing on a rickety chair to change a lightbulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a safe substitute . And if a child is the one to point out your error ? " Sometimes my kids will say , " Mommy , you said a bad word ! ' ' " Aberbach says . " I tell them , " You 're right , and I have to be more careful-I got very angry and it just came out . ' ' " Such admissions help kids learn honesty , remorse , and a willingness to accept criticism . ... but do n't be afraid to be a grown-up It 's healthy for kids to see that you live by some different rules than they do . Explain that " I can have Diet Coke because my body 's all grown up , but yours is n't " or " Daddy can stay up late because a thirty-five-year-old needs less sleep than a five-year-old . " " I think it 's good that my children have seen adults having a drink at our home , " says Judy Wertheinier of Pittsburgh . " I want them to understand that when they 're older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 'd never been exposed to alcohol , then went to college and started binge drinking . " On the other hand , Wertheimer feels that smoking in front of kids is never okay , since even moderate tobacco use can be very damaging to health . She has yet to tell sons Joey , 9 , and Eli , 8 , that she used to smoke . When she does , say experts , she should be honest and regretful-and emphasize how lucky she is that she did n't end up with a serious illness . Best policy when confessing a past vice : Consider whether your kids are ready to see shades of gray ( " Mommy used to do a bad thing , but that does n't make her a bad person " ) . Kids hit this stage at a wide variety of ages ; they 've probably reached it if they 're asking detailed questions about your past habits . take heart-and be a realist No matter how well you behave , your kids wo n't always follow your lead . " My napkin goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please pass the salt , " and I model , model , model-but sometimes it does n't stick , " Distler says . Stubbornness maybe to blame , therapists say . But often-especially with younger kids-it 's just pure incomprehension ( " Politeness and sharing : why ? " ) or disinterest ( " What 's in it for me ? " ) . Give a brief explanation , suggests Margaret Lindsey , M.D. , a child and adolescent psychiatrist in Rochester , New York . When her 13- and 8-year-old daughters were younger , she 'd say , for example : " One way we show we care about people is by demonstrating good manners . " She and other parents also find it effective to use incentives ranging from TV time and eating out to ice cream and cash . But even when he acts stubborn , your child may be learning more than you realize . ( Who has n't seen one preschooler correct another 's etiquette at a playdate ? ) And all this role modeling is good for parents , too . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Lisa Gorsch , mom of a 10-year-old and an 8-year-old in Charlottesville , Virginia . " I forced myself to keep a lid on my fear for their benefit . " Distler rarely used to exercise . " I decided if I want my kids to have a healthy lifestyle , they have to see it-so I started exercising , and now I love it . " The day I had my little epiphany about Davey 's finger sucking , I promised him I would quit my own hands-in-the-mouth habit , cold turkey . Weeks later , he is proudly , enthusiastically ... still sucking his fingers . But at least my nails look fabulous .
