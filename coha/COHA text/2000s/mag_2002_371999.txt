The tape lasts just over two minutes , like a trailer for an upcoming horror flick . Three Arab men appear in separate shots : one has wide eyes and a gesticulating left hand ; another appears to read from a text , never looking up at the camera ; the third buries his head between his knees , then cozies up to a Kalashnikov and smiles . The silent footage , released by the Justice Department last Thursday , was spliced together from five tapes recovered by allied forces in the rubble of the home of Mohammed Atef , al-Qaeda 's operations mastermind who was killed by a U.S. air strike in November . They were no ordinary home movies . The five men who appear on them are members of al-Qaeda , and U.S. authorities say they were recording messages of martyrdom  --  a move commonly made by people about to stage a suicide terrorist attack . <P> The release of the tape , which came a week after the broadcast of a seized al-Qaeda video detailing a bombing plot in Singapore , was a chilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elusiveness of its operatives . Attorney General John Ashcroft said the U.S. has launched an international manhunt for the five and asked the public to help " identify , locate and incapacitate " them . A senior U.S. official told TIME that the tapes were first viewed by CIA specialists , who passed them along to the FBI . Officials at both agencies were so convinced the tapes showed evidence of a possibly imminent suicide attack that they rushed them into the public eye before completing their usual analysis and translation of the footage . " It seemed like a good idea to get their faces widely shown , " says one official . " If we sat on the tapes and those guys did something bad , you could legitimately criticize us for failing to do everything possible . " <P> At least one face is familiar to U.S. investigators : Ramzi Binalshibh , a 29-year-old Yemeni who appears wearing a red kaffiyeh , was named as an unindicted co-conspirator of Zacarias Moussaoui , the French operative arrested in August and indicted Dec. 11 for planning terrorist attacks . U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be the 20th hijacker . A member of the Hamburg cell led by Mohammed Atta , he unsuccessfully tried to obtain a visa to enter the U.S. to take flying lessons on four occasions in 2000 . He also wired thousands of dollars to the hijackers ; last August he sent $14,000 to Moussaoui . On Sept. 5 , he fled Germany and has been at large since . In January 2000 , Binalshibh met in Malaysia with several al-Qaeda operatives  --  including two future hijackers and two men who would be implicated for planning the attack on the U.S.S. Cole . The CIA obtained a videotape of the meeting shortly after it took place . But Binalshibh was not identified until sometime after Sept. 11 . <P> The four others on the tapes  --  Muhammad Sa'id Ali Hasan , Khalid Ibn Muhammad Al-Juhani , Abd Al-Rahim and one as yet unidentified  --  had not previously appeared on America 's most wanted list . Administration officials do n't believe the tapes contain coded messages to al-Qaeda sleepers . Analysts say the tapes were created strictly for internal consumption or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting their fate as martyrs , joining the war against infidels and becoming one with Allah , but they did not discuss specific targets or timing .
