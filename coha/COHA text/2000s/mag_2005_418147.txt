HOW 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 // If you are about to become the parent of a toddler or preschooler and a baby , the operative word here is and . But the equation is not as simple as first-born plus newborn . It 's time for exponential math . Nancy Michel , a psychologist in Coquitlam , BC , who specializes in child and family psychology , puts it this way : When you have a family of three - two parents and a child you have three relationships . When that family expands to include a newborn , there are six relationships to consider . " And much of that consideration will be done by the older child . Michel points out that the needs of the first-born during this adjustment may be more complex . " The new baby needs nurturing and care . The older child , however , is dealing with a huge change . She needs to resolve feelings of jealousy that the baby has intruded upon what belongs to her , and to understand that her parents ' affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " There can be emotional challenges for parents as well . Sarah Aucoin of Mississauga , Ont. , who is mother to Riley , four , and John , two , remembers : " I did n't expect some of the feelings I had after the second baby . I would sometimes see a look on Riley 's face which would make me think , " What have I done ? " It was unexpected , and I also missed the one-to-one time I had always had with her . " Sarah 's experience is a good reminder that , indeed , every relationship in the family is undergoing change , and change rarely happens without a bit of anxiety . One thing we can do is try to prepare for those changes ahead of time . Your First-born - Before the Baby Arrives My toddler was enrolled in a program at the local YMCA during my second pregnancy . At first , I was able to run , kick soccer balls with her and help her climb ladders . As my pregnancy progressed , I was reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nursing babies while watching their kids play . It seemed miraculous to me that they were able to get more than one child snow-suited , much less equipped with diapers , snacks and drinks and off to a program before noon . It was becoming clear to me that the passionate , patient fascination I had for my first child 's every moment was going to be circumscribed , and I was worried already that I would not be able to continue to give Rosalyn all the attention that I loved giving her . A mother of three I met while sitting on my basketball was Rhondda Husband , of Millbrook , Ont . She gave me a great tip that helped us both prepare for the next baby . She suggested I ask my daughter if she would like the baby to bring her a present . I do n't think it had occurred to Rosalyn that her brother would come bearing gifts , but I asked what she would like him to bring her , and she replied without hesitation , " glitter glue . " Four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby for me , Roz asked if Nick had remembered her glitter glue . And I had ! I mean , he had ! Karen Blain and Tracey Reynolds of Ottawa are Mommy and Mama respectively to Braeden , aged four , and Ryan , four months . When Karen was expecting , says Tracey , " we emphasized how great it would be to be a big brother - teaching the baby how to eat and talk and walk , holding him , making faces for him . Early on , we had a kid 's book that showed the big brother showing toys but the new baby not responding - so what can you do with a newborn ? Put out your finger , walk the baby in the stroller and show your friends , rock the cradle . We found lots of ways for him to be with a new baby . " Tracey and Karen were taken aback when Braeden 's initial enthusiasm suddenly wavered . Tracey says , " Braeden appeared to be confused : Was the new sibling going to be a four-year-old like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival would behave roughly toward him like the kids at daycare . So he was relieved to hear the new baby would be " a little lump " at first , " she laughs . Tim and Sarah Aucoin involved their daughter , Riley , early on in the pregnancy . She went to every midwife appointment , and was there during the ultrasound . Tim says , " We talked about the baby a lot , and we had some good books . When John was born , Riley was there as soon as possible after the birth , and we were able to come home shortly after . I wanted to keep things as normal for her as we could . " Your First-born - After the Baby Arrives Remember that the new baby will never have had the experience of being an only child : It 's the first-born who is going to be faced with challenges . The Aucoins had talked to other parents of more than one child before John was born , so they were not surprised when Riley became fond of baby talk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Sarah adds , " She 's always been very bonded to me , and I expected these things because of the research I had done , and because I know my daughter . " Karen says , " It took Braeden about four weeks to be happy with the idea that the baby was here for good . Yes , there was characteristic acting up - but that 's pretty normal for a four-year-old anyway . At one point , he actually said , " I want to have bad behaviour . " Braeden seemed to make the adjustment in stages , Karen says . " First , there was excitement over his new status and about the new arrival . Then confusion because it was n't always exciting after all , followed by resentment - and finally slow acceptance as he got used to the new situation . " " Regressive behaviour " can be a way for kids to explore what it means to be ( and have ) a baby through play , or a coping mechanism when the stress of being " the big kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . Sarah and Tim Aucoin 's daughter , Riley , wanted to play baby sometimes . " Anytime she asked , I 'd say no problem , " Sarah says . " Riley still used a bottle after John arrived , and it was hard for her to give that up . She would sit close whenever I nursed the baby . And when she 'd ask to go into the crib , and I would say OK , I 'd help her in . " Nancy Michel says , " By all means , let the older children have a turn in the crib or pretend to be a baby . They will soon realize that it 's kind of boring . " You can also talk to your first-born about when she was a baby- how she learned to walk and talk , what made her laugh and cry . Look at her baby photos and tiny socks . Reminiscing together is a way of reassuring her , as well as a way to interest her in the new baby 's development . Other behaviours may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " just little " until there was a littler sib to compare to . " Riley would sometimes hug John too closely when he was very little , and it could turn into a squeeze or a choke . I would stop her , but never wanted to make her feel bad about it , " says Sarah . " I do n't think she was intentionally trying to hurt him , or that she understood that squeezing hard might hurt a small baby . I tried to explain , rather than shame . " These behaviours are perfectly normal , says Michel . " Usually , they dissipate after two to three months . So go with them . Let the child have the feelings . " Sometimes those feelings are out of sync with our wellintended plans . Karen and Tracey planned a " big brother party " for Braeden two weeks after the birth . As it turned out , that was at the height of Braeden 's confused feelings , and he protested , " I do n't want to be a big brother ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracey responded , " That 's OK . You 're going to feel that for a little while , but not always . " Karen adds , " We totally pulled back on the big brother thing . Really , it 's not so much about being a big brother - taking on a new role or new identity - because there was not that much to do . It was more about having a little brother . " Now that Ryan , just six weeks old , can actually make eye contact , Braeden is quite engaged and affectionate . When he said , " Mommy and Mama , you leave . But Ryan can stay , " they knew it was going to be OK . All Together Now Some couples plan ahead for changes they know or suspect will occur in their relationship . Others focus on the family as a whole . " Tim and I did n't do anything in particular regarding our relationship before the arrival of the second baby , " says Sarah Aucoin . " We just were n't thinking about ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one child and , really , you have no idea how much busier you will be with two until after the second arrives . Now , what helps us is that we make sure we have couple time together every night after the kids have gone to bed . We sit outside and talk when the weather 's nice , or just hang around together . " If we could do things over , I think we would have taken some time " away , just the two of us , before the baby was born , just to have some together time before the chaos of the early days broke out . Now , we try to get an evening out together , even if it 's only every couple of months . " In Ottawa , Karen and Tracey purposefully reviewed how they would approach baby care . Karen says , " With our first baby , areas of conflict came up around parenting styles , and we wanted to make sure they were resolved . " Tracey adds , " Better preparing ourselves the second time around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done for Braeden . " If couple time nourishes your partnership , time together as a family helps strengthen the multiple relationships involved . It 's a way for you to be with each child , and with your partner , at the same time . My family likes to listen to recorded stories and music : Peter and the Wolf is a favourite . We sit on a blanket on the floor and get " deliriously scared together . Tim Aucoin says , " We still try to have special one-to-one time with each of the kids , and time all together as a family . We try to have a good walk together once a week , at a conservation area or park . It 's easy , it 's free , it 's relatively close . Or we listen to music together and dance around ! Both our kids love music , and so do Sarah and I. " Finding another family whose children are close in age to your own is important too . Having two older children who can amuse themselves is , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splitting your focus . If there is a parent in the mix with whom you can have some good adult conversation , you are truly in luck . So while you are at the park , library or family resource centre , pay attention to which kids your children play well with and the parents with whom you can share coffee , conversation , complaints or suggestions . A like-minded family with kids the same age as yours can be a treasure and can reassure you that , in the end , it all works out . Do you remember the first time you looked at your first baby and realized you could not imagine what life would be like without that little person ? It will happen again : Soon , and , most importantly , it will happen for that little person who is now a big sister or brother .

Review your life insurance policy . If you intend your life insurance to support your family in the case of your untimely death , then you may need to increase the amount .

When our baby was about a month old , i watched as my three-year old daughter showed her friends how gently she could wipe the baby during a diaper change . She was very proud .
