From Part One : Sam 's Journey In mid-1947 , Jefferson Barnes , the prosecuting attorney of Polk County , Arkansas , finally died . Upon that tragedy  --  the old man fell out of one of those new golf cart things on vacation in Hot Springs , rolled down a gully screaming damnation and hellfire all the way , and broke his neck on a culvert  --  Sam Vincent , his loyal Number 2 , moved up to the big job . Then in ' 48 , Sam was anointed by the Democratic party ( there was no other in western Arkansas ) , which ran him on the same ticket with Harry S. Truman and Fred C. Becker . As did those worthies , he won handily . For Sam , it was the goal toward which he had been aiming for many years . He had always wanted to be a servant of the law , and now , much better , he was the law . Sam was six foot one , forty-four , with a bushy head of hair and a brusque demeanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . He stared immoderately and did not suffer fools , idiots , Yankees , carpetbaggers , the small of spirit or the breakers of the law gladly . He wore baggy suits flecked with pipe ash , heavy glasses , and walked in a bounding swoop . He hunted in the fall , followed the St. Louis Browns during the summer , when he had time , which he hardly ever did , and tied flies , though he fished rarely enough . Otherwise , he just worked like hell . His was classic American career insanity , putting the professional so far above the personal there almost was no personal , in the process alienating wife and children with his indifference , burning out secretaries with his demands , annoying the sheriff 's detectives with his directions . In what little time remained , he served on the draft board ( he had won the Bronze Star during the Battle of the Bulge ) , traveled five states to interview promising high school seniors who had applied to his beloved Princeton , played a weekly round of golf with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much eight-year-old bourbon . He knew everybody ; he was respected by everybody . He was a great man , a great American . He had the highest conviction rate of any county prosecutor in Arkansas , Oklahoma , Missouri , or Tennessee for that matter . He was not reelected . In fact , he lost in a landslide to a no'count lawyer named Febus Bookins , a genial hack who smelled of gin all the time and meant only to rob the county blind during his term of office . He called himself a reformer , and his goal was to reform his bank account into something more respectable . Sam had made one mistake , but it was a mistake which few in his home state , and in fact not many elsewhere , could ignore . In 1949 , he prosecuted a man named Willis Beaudine for raping a young woman named Nadine Johnson . It was an unremarkable case , save for the fact that Willis was a white person and Nadine a Negro girl . It is true she was quite light , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had comely ways , and was , perhaps , not normally so innocent as she looked when she appeared in court . But facts were facts , law was law . Certain evidence had been developed by Sam 's former investigator , Earl Swagger , who was now a state police sergeant and was famous for the big medal he had won during the war . Earl , however , risked nothing by testifying against Willis , for Earl was known to be a prideful , bull-headed man who could not be controlled by anyone and was feared by some . Sam , on the other hand , risked everything , and lost everything , although Willis was convicted and spent six months at the Tucker Farm . As for Nadine , she moved from town because even in her own community she was considered what Negro women called a " ' ho , " and moved to St. Louis , where her appetites soon got her murdered in a case of no interest to anyone . Sam had taken his defeat bitterly . If his family thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , he rented a small office on the town square of Blue Eye , the county seat , and commenced to spend most of his days and many of his nights there . He worked such small cases as came his way , but mainly he plotted out ways to return to office . He still hunted with Earl . His other friend was Connie Long-acre , the smart Eastern woman whom the county 's richest , most worthless son had brought back from his education at Annapolis in ' 30 and his failed naval career thereafter . Connie had soon learned how appetite-driven a man her Rance was , and while trying to raise her own hellion son , Stephen , fell to friendship with Sam , who alone in that part of Arkansas had been to a Broadway play , had met a gal under the clock at the Biltmore , and who did n't think Henry Wallace was a pawn of the Red Kremlin . Sam was never stupid , not on a single day in his life . He understood that one thing he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore he utterly refused to take any cases involving Negroes , even if they only revolved around one dark person suing another . There was a Negro lawyer in town , a Mr. Theopolis Simmons , who could handle such things ; meanwhile , Sam worked hard , politicked aggressively , kept tabs , sucked up to the gentry who had deposed him so gently , and tried to stay focused . Then , one day in June of 1951 , an unusual event occurred , though nothing in that day or the day or week before had suggested it would . Sam , alone in his office , worked through probate papers for a farmer named Lewis who had died intestate and whose estate was now being sued for back taxes by the state , which would drive his widow and four children off the property to  --  well , to nothing . Sam would not let this happen , if only he could figure out a way to  - -  He heard the door open . In the county 's employ he had always had a secretary ; now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushed his way through the fog of dense pipe smoke , and opened the door to peer into his anteroom . An elegant gentleman had seated himself on the sofa and was paging absently through an old copy of Look magazine . " Sir , do you have an appointment ? " Sam asked . The man looked up at him . He was tanned softly , as if from an expensive vacation at the beach , balding , and looked well tended , of an age that could have been anywhere between thirty and fifty . He was certainly prosperous , in a smooth-fitting blue pinstripe suit , a creamy white shirt and the black tie of a serious man . A homburg , gray pearl , lay on the seat beside him ; his shined shoes were cap-toed black bluchers , possibly bespoke , and little clocks or flowers marked his socks . The shoes were shined , Sam noticed , all the way down to the sole , which was an indication that a professional had done them , in a rail station , a hotel lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincent . I 'd be happy to make one , or if you prefer , to wait here until you have the time to see me . " " Hmm , " said Sam . He knew when money came to call . " I am currently in the throes of a case , " he said . " Mr. , ah  --  " " My name is Trugood , sir . " " Mr. Trugood . Have you a few minutes while I file and clear my desk ? " " Of course . I do n't mean to interrupt . " Sam ducked back in . Quickly he gathered the Lewis papers up , sealed them in a file , and put it into a drawer . His desk was a mess ; he did some elementary rearranging , which meant he 'd have to derearrange after the man left , but Sam could use a fee , he did n't mind admitting , for any return from the poor Lewises , or the Jenningses , or the Joneses , the Smiths , the Beaupres , the Deacons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed quite distant . More or less prepared , he removed a fresh yellow legal tablet from his cabinet and wrote the word trugood , and the date , atop it . He opened the door . " Sir , I can see you now . " " Thank you , Mr. Vincent . " Trugood stood elegantly , smiled at Sam as he walked through the door , pretended not to notice the debris , the mess , the strewn files , the moth-eaten deer 's head , or even the fog of sweetbriar gas that hung , almost moist , in the air . Sam passed him , gestured to a seat , and as he moved around the desk to sit , watched as the man placed a business card before him on the desk . " Ah , " said Sam . " A colleague . " " Indeed , " said the man , whose card announced him to be Davis Trugood , Esq. , of the firm of Mosely , Vacannes &; Destin , 777 North Michigan Avenue , Chicago , Illinois , Hillcrest 3080 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Thank you , Mr. Vincent . May I say , I 've heard a great deal about you , and I 've worked some to find you . " " I 've always been here , sir . I had no idea any reputation had spread beyond our little benighted state . Certainly not as far as a big sophisticated city like Chicago . " " Well , sir , possibly it has n't reached that far . But it has reached all through the South , or , I should say , a certain South . " " What South would that be , sir ? " " That South occupied by our population of color , sir . Our Negroes . They say you are the rare white lawyer who is fair to the man of Negro blood . " " Well , " said Sam , somewhat taken aback , " if by that they mean that as a prosecuting attorney I laid the same force of law against white as against black , then they are correct . I believe in the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not what you might call a race champion . I am not a hero of the Negro , nor do I ever mean to be . I believe history has dealt our American Negroes a sorry hand , as do many people . But I also believe that sorry hand will have to be corrected slowly . I am not one for tearing things down in service to various dubious moral sentiments , which in fact would turn my own race against me , which would unleash the savagery of the many embittered whites of the South against the poor Negro , which would in fact result in destruction everywhere . So , Mr. Trugood , if you thought I was someone to lead a crusade , change or challenge a law , throw down a gauntlet , burn a barn , sing a hymn , or whatever , why , I am not that man , sir . " " Mr. Vincent , thank you for speaking straight out . I must say , most Southern lawyers prefer to speak a code which one has to have attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , at least speak directly . " " I take a pleasure in that . Possibly the product of an Eastern education . " " Excellent , sir . Now , I need a representative to travel to a certain town deeper in the South and make private inquiries . This man has to be extremely smart , not without charm , stubborn as the Lord , a man of complete probity . He must also be somewhat brave , or at least the sort not turned feeble by a show of hostility . He also has to be comfortable around people of different bloods , white and Negro . He has to be comfortable around law enforcement officers of a certain type , the type that would as soon knock a fellow 's hat off as talk civilly to him . The fee for this service , perhaps lasting a week , would be quite high , given the complex diplomatic aspects of the situation . I would suppose you have no ethical objections to a high fee , Mr. Vincent . " " High fee . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , do go on , Mr. Trugood . You have my attention , without distraction . " " Thank you , sir . I am charged with executing a will for a certain rather well-off late Chicagoan . He had for many years in his employ a Negro named Lincoln Tilson . " Sam wrote : " Negro Lincoln Tilson " on his big yellow pad . " Lincoln was a loyal custodian of my client 's properties , a handyman , a bodyguard , a gardener , a chauffeur , a man whose brightness of temperament always cheered my client , who was negotiating a business career of both great success and some notoriety . " " I follow , sir , " said Sam . " Five years ago , Lincoln at last slowed down . My employer settled a sum on him , a considerable sum , and bid him farewell . He even drove him to the Illinois Central terminal to catch the City of New Orleans and reverse the steps by which he arrived up North so many years ago , for Lincoln 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had sprung in the South . Lincoln returned to his birthplace , a town called Thebes , in Thebes County , Mississippi . " Sam wrote it down , while saying , " That is the deepest part of the deepest South , I would imagine . " " It is , sir . " Thebes , as a word , rang ever so slightly in Sam 's imagination . He recalled that the original was a Greek town , city even , much fought over in antiquity . For some reason the number seven occurred in concert with it . " I see puzzlement , sir , " said Trugood . " You are well educated and no doubt think of Seven Against Thebes , by the Greek tragedian Aeschylus . I assure you , no army led by seven heroes is necessary in this case . Mississippi 's Thebes is a far distance from Aeschylus 's tragic town of war . It is a backwater Negro town far up the Yaxahatchee River , which itself is a branch of the Pascagoula River . It is the site of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored called Thebes Farm . " " That 's it , " said Sam . " It is legendary among the Negro criminal class , with whom I had many dealings as a young prosecutor . You do n't wants to go to Thebes , they say , do n't nobody never nohow come back from Thebes . ' Or words to that effect . " " It seems they have it mixed up with Hades in their simplicity . Yes , Thebes is not a pleasant place . Nobody wants to go to Thebes . " " Yet you want me to go to Thebes . That is why the fee would be so high ? " " There is difficulty of travel , for one thing . You must hire a boat in Pascagoula , and the trip upriver is unpleasant . The river , I understand , is dark and deep ; the swamp that lines it inhospitable . There was only one road into Thebes , through that same forbidding swamp ; it was washed out some years back , and Thebes County , not exactly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I see . " " Accommodations would be primitive . " " I slept in many a barn in the late fracas in Europe , Mr. Trugood . I can sleep in a barn again ; it wo n't hurt me . " " Excellent . Now here is the gist of the task . My client 's estate  --  as I say , considerable  --  is hung up in probate because Mr. Lincoln Tilson seems no longer to exist . I have attempted to communicate with Thebes County authorities , to little avail . I can reach no one but simpletons on the telephone , when the telephone is working , which is only intermittently . No letter has yet been answered . The fate of Lincoln is unknown , and a large amount of money is therefore frozen , a great disappointment to my client 's greedy , worthless heirs . " " I see . My task would be to locate either Lincoln or evidence of his fate . A document , that sort of thing ? " " Yes . From close-mouthed Southern types . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , or rather , the accent . They would hear the Chicago in my voice , and their faces would ossify . Their eyes would deaden . Their hearing would disintegrate . They would evolve backward instantaneously to the neolithic . " " That may be so , but Southerners are also fair and honest folk , and if you do n't trumpet your Northern superiority in their face and instead take the time to listen and master the slower cadences , they will usually reward you with friendship . Is there another issue here ? " " There is indeed . " He waved at his handsome suit , his handsome shoes , his English tie . His cufflinks were gold with a discreet sapphire , probably worth more than Sam had made in the last six months . " I am a different sort of man , and in some parts of the South  --  Thebes , say  --  that difference would not go unnoticed . " " You have showy ways , but they are the ways of a man of the world . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frankly , I 'm not a brave man . I 'm a man of desks . The actual confrontation , the quickness of argument , the thrust of will on will : not really my cup of tea , I 'm afraid . A sound man understands his limits . I was the sort of boy who never got into fights and did n't like tests of strength . " " I see . " " That is why I am buying your courage as well as your mind . " " You overestimate me . I am quite a common man . " " A decorated hero in the late war . " " Nearly everybody in the war was a hero . I saw some true courage ; mine was ordinary , if even that . " " I think I have made a very good choice . " " All right , sir . " " Thank you , Mr. Vincent . This is the fee I had in mind . " He wrote a figure on the back of his card , and pushed it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sending me to be your champion in hell , it sounds like , " said Sam . " But you are paying me well for the fight . " " You will earn every penny , I assure you . "
