FROM IRRITABLE HEART TO SHELL SHOCK // DURING THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR , it was called " irritable heart " or " nostalgia . " In the First World War , it became " shell shock , " " hysteria , " or " neurasthenia . " During World War II and the war in Korea , it was " war neurosis , " " battle fatigue , " or simply " exhaustion . " When veterans started coming home from Vietnam , it was at first called " Post-Vietnam syndrome . " Then , in 1980 , with the publication of the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-III ) , " posttraumatic stress disorder " ( PTSD ) entered the official lexicon . The names have changed over time , but the phenomenon they describe has remained distressingly constant : war causes mental illness that is life-altering and , in far too many cases , fatal . // Bullets and bombs are destructive to human beings in fairly predictable and immediately apparent ways . Terror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflict are no less real or incapacitating . Such wounds are more difficult to see , to categorize , or to measure . They have been less well understood and so have been more vulnerable to prejudice and superstition . Jonathan Shay , who has written two of the most important books about combat-induced trauma , champions the idea that PTSD is a legitimate war wound and that the veterans who suffer its injury " carry the burdens of sacrifice for the rest of us as surely as the amputees , the burned , the blind , and the paralyzed carry them . " // Over time , perhaps the most intractable prejudice has been that those who fall victim to the mental illness caused by war are somehow inherently weak in body or character . That belief has had , and continues to have , many adherents , in spite of evidence that some of the most famous and admired heroes of war , from Ulysses to Audie Murphy , have suffered from symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria of PTSD . The parallel misconception , that a warrior 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character firm , has likewise plagued and inconvenienced military organizations . If such ideal warriors could be reliably identified , it would certainly make the maintenance of armies more straightforward and the subsequent cost of disability pensions less daunting . Not for lack of trying , no such correlation has been discovered . After 150 years of study , there are still no reliable predictors for who will be affected by their combat experience and under what circumstances . Once affected , there is still no cure . All that is really known is that war is a disease that affects the minds of many who get close to its horrors . The disease can be so painful and debilitating that those afflicted often lose their health , their sanity , their dreams , their families , and often their lives . // The most recent DSM , the fourth edition , published in 1994 , describes the circumstances in which PTSD is likely to occur as " a traumatic event in which ... the person experienced , witnessed , or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the physical integrity of self or others , and the person 's response involved intense fear , helplessness , or horror . " // That description pointedly includes traumatic situations that might occur in either civilian or military contexts . It reflects the priorities of the two groups most instrumental in agitating for the official recognition and inclusion of PTSD in the DSM-and perhaps most affected by that recognition . Those two groups were the returning Vietnam veterans and the resurgent or second-wave women 's movement . The posttrauma symptoms experienced by veterans eerily mirrored those experienced by victims of sexual abuse . In the early ' 70s , the women 's movement had made violent crimes against women a central issue of its activist agenda and , as veterans and women came to recognize the commonality of their cause , they joined forces to lobby for official recognition of the disease from the medical community . It is poignant to note that since the original inclusion of PTSD in the DSM-III in 1980 , the criteria have changed . In the original , the traumatic event was described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That criterion was dropped in later editions . As Judith Herman so appropriately points out in Trauma and Recovery , " Rape , battery , and other forms of sexual and domestic violence are so common a part of women 's lives that they can hardly be described as outside the range of ordinary experience . And in view of the number of people killed in war over the past century , military trauma , too , must be considered a common part of human experience ; only the fortunate find it unusual . " // The symptoms that are typically manifested following such a trauma can be divided into three clusters . The first , the intrusive cluster , includes recurrent , uncontrollable recollections of the traumatic event , such as frightening dreams or flashbacks . Those flashbacks are often so convincingly " real " that the sufferer behaves as though he or she were actually in the remembered moment . The experience can be both terrifying and dangerous , not just for the one who experiences the intrusion , but for anyone else who happens to be present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid circumstances that might trigger such recollections or flashbacks . To that end , many sufferers withdraw from social contact . They experience a protective emotional numbing and a restricted range of emotions that suck the joy from life and the vitality from relationships . The third , or hyper-arousal cluster , involves difficulty sleeping , violent outbursts , and an exaggerated startle response . Individuals affected by this set of symptoms act as though they were still in immediate danger , leading to inappropriate , socially unacceptable behaviors . To officially fall within the diagnostic guidelines , the symptoms must last for at least a month . A duration of less than three months is considered " acute , " three months or more is considered " chronic , " and " delayed " refers to an onset of symptoms at least six months after the traumatic experience . // THE EARLY HISTORY OF PTSD // Official recognition of PTSD may be relatively new , but the history of combat-related distress is an old one . Jonathan Shay is both a psychiatrist who treats Vietnam combat veterans and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Iliad , would almost certainly be diagnosed as having PTSD today . In his book Achilles in Vietnam , Shay parallels the behaviors and symptoms of the Greek hero in Homer 's 2,700-year-old story with those of American veterans of the war in Vietnam , and finds them to be strikingly similar . The vulnerability of Achilles ' heel is a symbol for the vulnerability of his mind . His grief and rage at the death of his friend Patroclus , and his sense of betrayal at the hands of his commander , Agamemnon , are such that he suffers a breakdown and has to be restrained so he can not harm himself . He then directs his pain outward , committing atrocities against the living and the dead until the gods and even the ghost of Patroclus are appalled and intervene . // Agamemnon 's betrayal of Achilles may seem tame to a modern audience , when compared to the systemic leadership betrayals suffered by American soldiers who fought in Vietnam , but it is from that betrayal , Shay argues , that " the catastrophic operational failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Iliad " directly flowed . And , he adds , it was that betrayal from leadership , coupled with the death of Patroclus , that was responsible for Achilles ' personal collapse . Shay uses the term th ? mis , a word he translates from the Greek as " what 's right " to describe the " trustworthy structure " that should characterize a soldier 's relationships within the military . The horizontal , or peer , relationships , the vertical relationships along the chain of command , and the personal relationships that soldiers have with their branch of the service all must be grounded in the belief that they have been appropriately trained and supplied . In the absence of such a trustworthy structure , soldiers are exposed to the combination of moral grievance and combat stress . Shay believes it is that combination that is central to lasting psychological injury . " Veterans can usually recover from horror , fear , and grief once they return to civilian life , so long as ' what 's right ' has not been violated . " // PTSD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army , which became the U.S. Army , was plagued with mental health disorders that are recognizably similar to those seen today . Labels of " melancholia " and " insanity " were loosely applied to the most extreme cases , the psychoses , the paralyses , or to those who suffered from invasive flashbacks . " Nostalgia " referred to chronic situational depressions , which were thought to stem primarily from homesickness . " Drunkenness , " according to Joseph Lovell ( surgeon general , 1817-1828 ) , was responsible for half of the deaths in the U.S. Army during the period of his tenure . Lovell was a temperance advocate who succeeded in abolishing the daily rum ration , which probably makes him a questionable primary source , but it does seem likely that some of the excess consumption , not unlike the self-medication so frequently noted among today 's vets , was an attempt to keep demons at bay . // The psychic distress of soldiers was a serious but relatively uncomplicated issue for nineteenth-century commanders . During the years of the American Civil War , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and character would maintain a " manly " attitude in battle . There was little sympathy in either army for those who did not . Both armies made discharge for psychiatric complaints virtually impossible . If a soldier was beyond masking his traumatic symptoms , he had few options . If he tried to desert and was caught , his comrades would be forced to stand at attention to witness his execution . He would be buried where he fell , and the ground smoothed over his unmarked grave to symbolically erase his existence . He otherwise might apply for a psychiatric discharge and , in some cases , a sympathetic commanding officer would reassign him to light duty . But in applying for relief , he risked calling attention to his distress . If his application was rejected and he could not manage to mask his symptoms , he would be officially labeled a coward or a malingerer . The penalty for cowardice or malingering was the same as that for desertion . He might just as well have run off in the first place . Executions were intended both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks into obedience . Such severe consequences must have discouraged many from seeking help . They certainly encouraged many others to resort to flight . // At the outset , the social and economic issues over which the war was fought had inspired passion on both sides . Romantic notions of heroism , glory , and honor fed a short-lived frenzy of voluntarism in both the North and the South . By 1862 , however , as word of battlefield carnage , rampant disease , and intense hardships became known , the enthusiastic rush to enlist was seriously slowed . The Confederate army was forced to pass a draft law in 1862 . The Union followed suit the next year . The laws were unpopular , unwieldy , and patently unfair . They exempted most professionals , and included commutation and substitution clauses , which allowed a draftee to buy his way out of service altogether or pay to send someone else in his place . Pundits North and South began calling it " a rich man 's war and a poor man 's fight . " Shay would have called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the draft provoked draft riots in several cities , most notably in New York . // Whether drafted or enlisted , though , the soldiers who fought for the North or for the South were certainly exposed to " events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury , or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others , " and there was adequate cause for a response that " involved intense fear , helplessness , or horror . " It is impossible to know how many of the almost 400,000 deserters ( about 10 percent of both armies ) were running from personal demons , but it was the only recourse , short of execution or suicide , available to those most acutely afflicted . // Against that background , Dr. Jacob Mendes DaCosta is credited with conducting the first scientific study of combat-related stress . He called the array of symptoms he identified " the irritable heart of a soldier " because so many of his patients complained of shortness of breath , palpitations , anxiety , and chest pain . But generally , soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William Hammond , who was Lincoln 's surgeon general , appropriately called the state of nineteenth-century American medicine " the end of the medical Middle Ages . " Unlike their European counterparts , who were becoming familiar with the work of Koch and Pasteur , and who were adopting scientific methodologies to investigate disease , American doctors who served in both armies had virtually no practical training or clinical experience . Their understanding of a soldier 's symptoms was therefore based largely on superstition , custom , and a good measure of imagination and the supernatural . What DaCosta diagnosed as irritable heart , another doctor might have called insanity or sunstroke . " Nostalgia , " which was a popular diagnostic category at the beginning of the war , implied a weakness of character neither army chose to indulge . After the early years , the diagnosis was firmly discouraged : 5,200 soldiers were hospitalized with " nostalgia " before 1853 , but between 1853 and 1865 not a single case was reported . There were , however , 145,000 hospitalizations for constipation , 66,000 for headache , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book about the traumatic effects of combat on American Civil War veterans , Shook over Hell , is taken from the medical records of one Jason Roberts , a Union soldier who used this expression when describing his symptoms to doctors . Doctors described Roberts as " sometimes ... raving and excited , at others melancholy .... Very peculiar and eccentric , flying from one Subject to another , and talking incoherently on all Subjects .... The subject of religion and his experiences in the army being paramount in his mind . " The core of Dean 's book is an analysis of the case histories of 291 Civil War veterans who , between 1861 and 1920 , were committed to the Indiana Hospital for the Insane . Using medical records , letters , memoirs , newspaper articles , and pension files , Dean concludes that , whatever nineteenth-century doctors chose to call it , these inmates all suffered from symptoms that would today be diagnosed as PTSD . " Many of these men , " Dean writes , " continued to suffer from the aftereffects of the war and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private hell involving physical pain , the torment of fear , and memories of killing and death . " // A tradition of support for disabled veterans dates back to the original colonies . The laws of the Plymouth Colony in 1636 promised soldiers that " if any that shall goe returne maymed and hurt he shalbe mayntayned competently by the Colony duringe his life . " In 1776 , the Continental Congress pensioned veterans who had been disabled in the Revolution . After the Civil War , however , activist veterans organized and lobbied for a pension system that would cover not only those who had been disabled , but all Union Army veterans and their dependents . ( Veterans of the Confederate army were not eligible for any federal benefits and had to rely on relatively modest state entitlement programs . ) By 1891 , fully one-third of the federal budget went to military pensions , and eventually , more money was paid out in pensions than the $8 billion spent on prosecuting the war itself . //           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
