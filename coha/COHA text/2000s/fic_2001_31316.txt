San Diego , California , 2001 West of encinitas on the pacific coast , the graceful motor yacht Nepenthe swung at anchor , the grandest craft in a flotilla that seemed to include every sailboat and powerboat in San Diego . With her fluid drawn-out lines , the spearlike sprit jutting from the thrusting clipper bow , and her flaring tran-som , the two-hundred-foot-long Nepenthe looked as if she were made of fine white china floating on a Delft sea . Her paint glistened with a mirror finish , and her brightwork sparkled under the California sun . Flags and pennants snapped and fluttered from stem to stern . Bobbing balloons occasionally broke loose to soar into the cloudless sky . In the yacht 's spacious British Empire &shy; style salon a string quartet played a Vivaldi piece for the eclectic gathering of black-clad Hollywood types , corpulent politicians , and sleek TV anchors who milled around a thick-legged mahogany table devouring pt beluga caviar , and shrimp with the gusto of famine victims . Outside , crowding the sun-drenched decks , children sat in wheelchairs or leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresh sea air . Hovering over them like a mother hen was a lovely woman in her fifties . Gloria Ekhart 's generous mouth and cornflower-blue eyes were familiar to millions who had seen her movies and watched her popular sitcom on TV . Every fan knew about Ekhart 's daughter Elsie , the pretty , freckle-faced young girl who scooted around the deck in a wheelchair . Ekhart had given up acting at the peak of her career to devote her fortune and time to helping children like her own . The influential and well-heeled guests chugging down Dom Perignon in the salon would be asked later to open their checkbooks for the Ekhart Foundation . Ekhart had a flair for promotion , which was why she leased the Nepenthe for her party . In 1930 , when the vessel slid off the ways at the G. L. Watson boatyard in Glasgow , she was among the most graceful motor yachts ever to sail the seas . The yacht 's first owner , an English earl , lost her in an all-night poker game to a Hollywood mogul with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starlets . She went through a succession of equally indifferent own-ers , winding up in a failed attempt as a fishing boat . Smelling of dead fish and bait , the rotting yacht languished in the back corner of a boatyard . She was rescued by a Silicon Valley magnate who tried to recoup the millions he spent restoring the vessel by leasing her out for events such as the Ekhart fund-raiser . A man wearing a blue blazer with an official race badge pinned to the breast pocket had been peering through binoculars at the flat green expanse of the Pacific . He rubbed his eyes and squinted into the lenses again . In the distance thin white plumes were etched against the blue sky where it met the water . He lowered the binoculars , raised an aerosol can-ister with a plastic trumpet attached , and pressed the button three times . Hawnk ... hawnk ... hawnk . The klaxon 's blaring squawk echoed across the water like the mating call of a monster gander . The flotilla took up the signal . A cacophony of bells , whistles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of hungry gulls . Hundreds of spectators excitedly reached for their binoculars and cameras . Boats heeled dangerously as passengers shifted to one side . On the Nepenthe the guests wolfed down their food and poured from the salon sipping from glasses of bubbly . They shaded their eyes and looked off in the dis-tance , where the feathery plumes were thickening into ban-tam rooster tails . Carried on the breeze was a sound like an angry swarm of bees . In a circling helicopter a thousand feet above the Nepenthe , a sturdy Italian photographer named Carlo Pozzi tapped the pilot 's shoulder and pointed to the northwest . The water was marked by parallel white streaks advancing as if plowed by a huge , invisible harrow . Pozzi checked his safety harness , stepped out onto a runner with one foot , and hefted a fifty-pound television camera onto his shoulder . Leaning with a practiced stance into the wind that buffeted his body , he brought the extraordinary power of his lens to bear on the advancing lines . He swept the camera from left to right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen race boats cutting furrows in the sea . Then he zoomed in on a pair of boats leading the pack by a quarter of a mile . The speeding craft skimmed the wave tops , their forty-foot hulls planing with elevated bows as if trying to escape the restraints of gravity . The lead boat was painted a bold firehouse red . Trailing by less than a hundred yards , the sec-ond boat sparkled like a gold nugget . The boats were more like star fighters than craft designed for travel over water . Their flat decks connected two knife-edged catamaran hulls called sponsons and aerodynamic wings over the engine compartments . Twin F-16 &shy; type canopies were set side-by-side two-thirds of the way back from the sharp-pointed double prows . Squeezed into the red boat 's right-hand canopy , his sun-bronzed face fixed in a mask of determination , Kurt Austin braced himself as the eight-ton craft slammed against the concrete-hard water again and again . Unlike a land vehicle , the boat had no shock absorbers to cushion the jarring impact . Each jolt traveled through the one-piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rattled his teeth . Despite his broad shoulders , his muscular biceps , and the five-point harness system that strapped his two-hundred- pound frame in place , he felt like a basketball being dribbled down the court by Michael Jordan . Every ounce of strength in his muscular six-foot-one body was needed to keep a steady hand on the trim tabs and the throt-tle levers and a firm left foot on the engine pedal controlling the pressure in the mighty twin turbos that sent the boat thundering over the water . Jos " Joe " Zavala sat hunched over the steering wheel in the left canopy . His gloved hands tightly gripped the small black wheel that seemed inadequate for the task of keeping the boat pointed in the right direction . He felt as if he were aiming rather than steering the boat . His mouth was set in a grim line . The large dark brown eyes had lost their usual soul-ful look as they strained intently through the tinted Plexiglas visor to read the sea conditions for changes in wind or wave height . The up-and-down movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat 's behavior , quite literally , by the seat of his pants , Zavala felt the waves and troughs through his steering wheel . Austin barked into the intercom mike that connected the canopies . " What 's our speed ? " Zavala glanced at the digital speed gauge . " One twenty-two . " His eyes went to the GPS position and compass . " Right on course . " Austin checked his watch and looked down at the chart fastened to his right thigh . The one-hundred-sixty-mile race began in San Diego , made two sharp turns around Santa Catalina Island , and came back to the starting point , giving thousands of spectators along the beaches a view of the dra-matic finish . The final turn should be coming up any minute . He squinted through the spray-splashed canopy and saw a vertical line off to the right , then another . Sailboat masts ! The spectator fleet flanked a wide swath of open water . Once past the spectators , the racers would pick up the Coast Guard cutter near the turn buoy and head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his right shoulder and caught the reflection of the sun off gold . " Kicking it up to one-thirty , " Austin said . The hard shocks coming through the steering wheel indicated that the wave height was growing . Zavala had observed white flecks in the water and a distinct marbling to the seas that told him the wind was up . " Do n't know if we should , " Zavala yelled over the shriek of the engines . " Picking up a slight chop . Where 's Ali Baba ? " " Practically in our back pocket ! " " He 's crazy if he makes his play now . He should just lie back and let us take the lumps like he 's been doing , then go for the home stretch . Sea and wind are too unpredictable . " " Ali does n't like to lose . " Zavala grunted . " Okay . Take it to one twenty-five . Maybe he 'll back off . " Austin pushed down with his fingertips on the throttles and felt a surge of speed and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-seven . Seems okay . " The gold boat fell back , then speeded up to keep pace . Austin could read the black lettering on the side : Flying Carpet . The boat 's driver was hidden behind the tinted glass , but Austin knew the bearded young Omar Sharif look-alike would be grinning from ear to ear . The son of a Dubai hotel magnate , Ali Bin Said was one of the toughest competitors in one of the world 's most competitive and dangerous sports , Class 1 offshore powerboat racing . Ali came within a whisker of beating Austin at the Dubai Duty Free Grand Prix the year before . The loss in his own backyard before his home audience was particularly galling . Ali had beefed up the power in the Carpet 's twin Lamborghini engines . With improvements in its power plant the Red Ink squeezed out a few extra miles per hour , but Austin estimated Ali 's boat was a match for his . At the prerace briefing Ali had jokingly accused Austin of calling in the National Underwater &; Marine Agency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the Special Assignments Team for NUMA , Austin had the resources of the huge agency at his command . But he knew better than to play King Canute . Ali had been beaten not by engine power but by the way Austin and his NUMA partner clicked together as a team . Zavala , with his dark complexion and thick , straight black hair always combed straight back , could have passed for the matre d ' in a posh Acapulco resort hotel . The slight smile always on his lips masked a steely resolve forged in his college days as a middleweight boxer and honed by the frequent challenges of his NUMA assignments . The gregarious and softspoken marine engineer had thousands of hours piloting helicopters , small jets , and turbo-prop air-craft and easily switched to the cockpit of a race boat . Working with Austin as if they were parts in a precision machine , he took command of the race from the second the referee raised the green starting flag . They were up on plane at a near-ideal angle and blasted across the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every boat had hit the finish line with throttle straight out . Two hard-driven competitors blew out their engines on the first lap , one flipped on the first turn , probably the most dangerous part of any race , and the rest were simply out-classed by the two leaders . The Red Ink rocketed by the others as if they were stuck on fly paper . Only the Flying Carpet kept pace . During the first Catalina Island turn , Zavala had maneuvered the Red Ink around the buoy so that Ali went wide . The Flying Carpet had been playing catch-up ever since . Now the Carpet had taken wing and was coming abreast of the Red Ink . Austin knew of Ali 's last-minute switch to a smaller propeller that would be better in rough seas . Austin wished he could trade in his large calm-water propeller . Ali had been smart to listen to his weather sense rather than the forecast . " I 'm cranking her up another notch ! " Austin shouted . " She 's at one-forty now , " Zavala yelled back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't slow down . " Austin knew a high-speed turn was risky . The twin catamaran sponsons skated across the surface with practically no water resistance . The same design that allowed for high speed over the wave tops also meant wind could get under the hull , lift it in a kiting motion , or , even worse , flip it back onto its deck . The Flying Carpet continued to gain . Austin 's fingertips played over the tops of the throttle levers . He hated to lose . His combativeness was a trait he 'd inherited from his father along with the football player physique and eyes the color of coral underwater . One day it would get him killed . But not today . He eased back on the throttles . The maneuver may have saved their lives . A white-crested four-foot rogue sea was racing in off the port bow , practically snarling as it bore down on them . Zavala saw it angling in , prayed they 'd clear it , knew instantly that the timing was all wrong . The wave hooked one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Ink was launched spinning into space . With lightning reflexes Zavala steered in the direction of the spin like a driver caught on an ice patch . The boat splashed into the water sideways , rolled so the canopies were buried , then righted after a few more yaws . Ali slowed down , but once he saw they were all right , he gunned his engines , throwing caution to the winds . He wanted to finish as far ahead of Austin as possible . Ignoring the advice of his veteran throttle man , Hank Smith , Ali pushed his boat to the edge . The giant rooster tail arced high in the air for hundreds of feet , and the twin propellers plowed a wide and double-furrowed wake for hundreds more . " Sorry about that , " Zavala called out . " Caught a wave . " " Great save . Let 's go for second place . " Austin pushed the throttles forward , and with a scream of the engines they were off in hot pursuit . High above the race course the Italian TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chopper swooped out in a wide circle and came back over the flotilla to hover at midchannel . Pozzi wanted a wide shot of the lone boat speeding past the spectators to the turn buoy for the final approach to San Diego . The cameraman glanced at the sea below to get his bearings and saw wavelets out-lining a large , shiny , grayish object mounding at the surface . A trick of the light . No , there was definitely something there . He caught the attention of the pilot and pointed straight down . " What the hell is that ? " the pilot said . Pozzi aimed the camera at the object and zoomed in with the touch of a button . " It 's a balena , " he said as the object came into focus . " For God 's sake , speak English . " " How you say ? A whale . " " Oh , yeah , " the pilot replied . " You see them migrating . Do n't worry , he 'll dive when he hears the boats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head . " I think he 's dead . He 's not moving . " The pilot put the chopper at a slight angle for a better view . " Hell , you 're right . There 's another one . I 'm counting three no , four . Damn ! They 're popping up all over the place . " He switched to the hailing channel . " Come in , San Diego Coast Guard . This is the TV helicopter over the race course . Emergency ! " A voice crackled over the radio . " Coast Guard station at Cabrillo Point . Go ahead . " " I 'm seeing whales in the race course . " " Whales ? " " Yeah , maybe a dozen . I think they 're dead . " " Roger , " the radio man said . " We 'll alert the cutter on scene to check them out . " " Too late , " the pilot said . " You 've got to stop the race . " A tense silence followed . Then : " Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to a call from the station , the Coast Guard cutter moved from its post at the turn buoy . Orange signal flares blossomed against the blue sky . Ali saw neither the flares nor the bloated gray carcass floating in his path until it was too late . He yanked the wheel , missed the obstruction by inches , dodged another body , but could not avoid a third . He veered off , yelling at Hank to cut power . Smith 's fingers flew to the throttle , and the planing hull settled down . The Carpet was still going fifty miles an hour when it hit the carcass . With an explosion of foul air , the body popped like a huge blubbery balloon . The boat careened off on one sponson , flipped , somer-saulted , and miraculously landed right-side up again . Ali and the throttle man were saved from fractured skulls by their helmets . Working through a black haze , Ali reached for the wheel and tried to turn , but there was no response from the rudder . He called out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the Nepenthe the captain had left the bridge and was down on the deck talking to Gloria Ekhart when the actress leaned over the rail and pointed . " Excuse me , Captain . What 's that gold boat doing ? " The Flying Carpet was wallowing like a punch-drunk boxer trying to find a neutral corner . Then the twin bows came around , and the boat straightened out , gained speed , and assumed a trajectory aimed at the yacht 's midships . The captain waited for the boat to veer off . It kept coming . Alarmed , he calmly excused himself , stepped aside , and whipped a walkie-talkie from his belt . His mental computer was calculating how long it would take the gold boat to hit them . " This is the captain , " he barked into the hand radio . " Get this ship under way ! " " Now , sir ? During the race ? " " Are you deaf ? Weigh anchor and move this ship out . Now . " " Move ? Where sir ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way in time , and his helmsman wanted to play twenty questions . " Forward , " he shouted , close to panic . " Just move it ! " Even as he barked the order the captain knew it was too late . The race boat had already cut the distance in half . He started to herd children to the other side of the yacht . Maybe a few lives would be saved , although he doubted it . The wooden hull would shatter into splinters , fuel would be spilled in a fiery conflagration , and the yacht would go to the bottom within minutes . As the captain grabbed onto a wheelchair with a little girl in it and pushed her across the deck , he yelled at others to do the same . Too frozen by fear to react , Ekhart saw the gold torpedo speeding toward them and instinctively did the only thing she could . She put her arm protectively around her daughter 's thin shoulders and held her tight .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
