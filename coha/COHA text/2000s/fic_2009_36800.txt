Putting my hand on the brass doorknob , I glanced at my watch before opening the door . Zach and I would n't get to Powell Station before dark unless we left Savannah within the hour . Mama and Daddy should n't see the young lawyer 's light brown ponytail for the first time after sunset . <p> On the wall of the conference room hung a massive painting of the Savannah waterfront before the Civil War . At the end of the shiny table sat Joe Carpenter , the managing partner of Braddock , Appleby , and Carpenter . To his left was Myra Dean , a litigation paralegal . Across the table was a man I 'd never met . <p> " Tami , " Mr. Carpenter said , " this is Mr. Jason Paulding . " <p> Paulding , a balding , stocky man in his early forties , wore an open-collared shirt with a steel beam embroidered on the front . His round head would be the perfect resting place for a hard hat . <p> " Any projects you have to finish before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> " No , sir , but- " <p> " Good , " the tall , gray-haired lawyer continued . " As soon as Jason started going over his problem , I knew this was a case for you . You know something about fanatic religious groups , do n't you ? " <p> " No , sir , except what I read in the paper . I 've never been to the Middle East . " <p> Mr. Carpenter smiled slightly . " I do n't mean terrorists . I 'm talking about the lunatic fringe of the church , fundamentalists who do n't know where religion stops and tolerance begins . " The lawyer turned toward Paulding . " Tami is one of the sharpest summer law clerks we 've ever had at the firm . She goes to church every time the doors open , but her beliefs make her tougher , not softer . There 's no ' turn the other cheek ' in her version of the Bible . A week ago she stared me down in a criminal matter when I challenged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State v. Jones made me wince . <p> " Mr. Carpenter , that 's not quite accurate- " <p> " Do n't argue with me , now , " the senior partner said , cutting me off . " Save your ammunition for Ramona Dabney , the dime-store preacher who claims Mr. Paulding is the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler . " <p> " It 's worse than that , " Paulding said , " and I want it stopped . I offered the church twice the appraised value for its property . All I got back was a bunch of harassing phone calls to people all over town . " <p> " Jason and his staff have done some of the homework for us , " Mr. Carpenter said , sliding a sheet of paper across the table . " This is a list of people contacted by Dabney . " <p> " She even organized a protest outside our corporate office . " <p> " Myra , copy this list for Tami , divide the names , and interview all of them . There may be more . Get affidavits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then provide a summary to me . " <p> " What are we asking them ? " I asked . <p> " Everything you can think of , " Mr. Carpenter said . " Do n't let anyone try to tell you what they think is important ; find out for yourself . Persistence is one of your strengths . Use it . " <p> Mr. Carpenter 's mind could race ahead so fast it was difficult to see more than a cloud of dust in the distance . If patient , I hoped a fuller explanation of my task would emerge when he came back into view . I pushed my long brown hair behind my ears . <p> " When do you want the summaries and affidavits ? " Myra asked . <p> My stomach turned over . A twenty-three-year-old summer clerk was n't supposed to work overtime , but Mr. Carpenter had started treating me more and more like a junior associate . <p> " In the next few weeks . " <p> I sighed in relief . <p> " Why wait ? " Paulding asked indignantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , do n't you have enough to file suit ? " <p> " Our representation is similar to your company building a shopping center . We follow a carefully laid-out plan to make sure we 're thorough . " <p> " I do n't want a fancy lawsuit that takes three years , " Paulding said , his voice rising . " Last week this woman wrote my wife a letter accusing me of all kinds of stuff . I know how lawyers drag things out . If you 're not going to do anything , I 'll find a cheaper lawyer who will . I want a court order putting a stop to this . And I want it now ! " <p> " No you do n't , " Mr. Carpenter replied calmly . " It 's good for you and your business if Ms. Dabney continues . " <p> " What ? " Paulding burst out , the veins in his neck bulging . " That 's crazy . Are you an idiot ? " <p> Stretching my long fingers , I put my pen on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the office . Mr. Carpenter had plenty of business ; he did n't need to put up with abuse from a prospective client . <p> " Who referred you to me ? " Mr. Carpenter asked calmly . <p> Paulding rubbed the top of his head . " Frank Newsome . " <p> " Did he accuse me of wasting time by churning his file to make a big fee ? " <p> " No . " <p> " What did he tell you ? " <p> " That you saved his company when he thought he was going to lose everything . " <p> " How is his business doing now ? " <p> " Fine . He does a lot of subcontracting work for us . The Dabney woman went to see him with one of her crazy visions . He ordered her out of his office and told me to call you . " <p> Mr. Carpenter pointed at me . " Ms. Taylor can work on your file for a fraction of my hourly rate . Does that sound like I 'm trying to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't make sense that you want this preacher woman running her mouth all over town . If this keeps up , she 's going to hurt our business . She already has . " <p> " Good , good , that 's even better , " Mr. Carpenter replied , holding up his hand before Paulding could explode again . " Hear me out . How much profit did you expect to make from the development your company was going to build on the site that included the church ? " <p> " I gave up on that deal . The church parcel was in the middle of the entire tract . Without it , the project would n't work . " <p> " Was it a good opportunity ? " <p> " Yeah , one of the best ever . " <p> " So , what did you hope to clear ? " <p> Paulding scratched his chin . " At least a million and a half after costs , maybe more . The anchor tenants were already lined up . " <p> " Would you still like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were counting on it so much that I passed on another great opportunity . The whole thing left us losing money for the quarter , probably for the year . " <p> Mr. Carpenter picked up a sheet of paper . " According to the copy of the deed in your file , the property is owned by Ramona Dabney , individually , not the church . " <p> " That 's what my real-estate lawyer told me . " <p> " Tami , what do you think about that arrangement ? An individual owning the property where a church is located ? " <p> " Most church property is owned by trustees selected by the congregation or held by a denomination . " <p> " That 's the way it is at my church , " Mr. Carpenter said . " Not so at the Southside Church . God 's green acres on Gillespie Street are controlled by Reverend Dabney . " <p> Mr. Carpenter 's sarcastic tone made me uneasy . All ministers deserved at least token respect . <p> The older lawyer continued . " Jason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering Dabney to stop defaming you and set her up so that if she violates the order , a judge would hold her in contempt and put her in jail ? " <p> " Now you 're talking . " <p> Mr. Carpenter turned to me . " Tami , is obtaining an injunction difficult when there have n't been threats of physical violence ? " <p> " Yes , sir . It would be a prior restraint against free speech . " <p> Paulding cut in . " She 's told people that I 'm one of the biggest sinners in Savannah . " <p> " Which is up to the Almighty , not her , " Mr. Carpenter answered dryly . " Seeking an injunction can be part of our claim . I also recommend a civil suit against Dabney , seeking damages for libel and slander-libel for what she 's written , slander for what she 's said . Some of her statements are so bad there 's no need to prove a negative economic impact on your business to state a claim , but it always helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When that happens , the case moves beyond hurt feelings and creates an opportunity for a significant money judgment against her . " <p> " Which is a waste of your time and my money , " Paulding grunted . " Dabney drives a beat-up car and lives beside the church in a house the fire department should burn down for practice . I want the injunction . A money judgment would be worthless . " <p> " No , sir . " Mr. Carpenter rubbed his neatly trimmed goatee . " You 're wrong . A civil judgment is exactly what you need . Because Dabney owns the church property individually , it 's not protected by a nonprofit denomination or board of trustees . If you have a judgment against her , you can levy on the church and house to satisfy what 's owed . " <p> " Yes , " Myra muttered , her fingers flying across the keyboard . <p> " How much is the property worth as raw land without the buildings ? " Mr. Carpenter asked Paulding . <p> " Standing alone or as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Not much . " Paulding shrugged . " The buildings do n't add value since they 'd have to be torn down before something commercial could be built . Maybe fifty thousand . I offered her seventy-five thousand the day she ordered me off her front porch . " <p> " What are the chances Dabney can afford to hire a good lawyer to stop us from getting what we want ? " <p> " I see where you 're going . " Paulding nodded . " I tried to get her to talk to a lawyer . She told me she does n't believe in them . " <p> " Let 's hope that 's a conviction , not a preference . " Mr. Carpenter turned to Myra and me . " Your job is to find evidence that will convince a jury to award a judgment large enough to blow up Ramona Dabney 's pulpit . " <p> " Yes , sir , " Myra said . <p> My mouth was dry . Most American churches had wandered far from God 's plan , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to practice our beliefs . Declaration of war against a church , even one as misguided as this one , made me nervous . <p> " Perhaps Reverend Dabney just feels threatened and lashed out , " I offered . " If we let her know someone understands her concerns , it could lead to common ground for negotiation . " <p> " The only ground I 'm interested in is the dirt where the church sits , " Paulding said . <p> " Tami , your sympathy is misplaced , " Mr. Carpenter said . " The First Amendment does n't protect every kind of speech . This Dabney woman has crossed the line and should be held accountable . When I take her deposition , I 'll throw in a few questions to uncover her latent psyche and satisfy your curiosity . In the meantime , I want you to keep your eye on the main goals-to put a cork in her mouth and find a way to pry her grip from that property . " <p> Mr. Carpenter stood , signaling the end of the meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulding toward the reception area . <p> After Mr. Carpenter was out of earshot , Myra spoke in a low voice . " I 've worked with Joe for fifteen years . Never criticize his theory of a case in front of a client . If he did n't like you , he would have kicked you out of the meeting . Save your questions for later after we conduct our investigation . " <p> " How did I criticize him ? " <p> " By suggesting negotiation when he wants to file suit . " <p> " But what if the facts do n't support his theory ? Wo n't the client get upset ? " <p> " No . Once a businessman like Paulding believes we 're going to do everything we can for him , it 's not too hard to suggest a different approach later on . Getting over the initial trust hurdle is the hard part . All Paulding cares about is finding a lawyer as passionate about his problem as he is . When you say negotiate , he hears defeat . Joe read him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She was right , and I knew it . But it all seemed so disingenuous . <p> " And do n't call it manipulation , " Myra added , reading my thoughts . " It 's simply savvy client relations . Like women 's handbags , one size does n't fit all . " <p> We reached the law firm library that served as my temporary office for the summer . <p> " I 'll set up a duplicate file so we have the same information , " Myra said , stopping outside the door . " Then we can divide up the names and get busy on Monday . " <p> After Myra left , I went into the library . The other female summer clerk , Julie Feldman , a Jewish law student from Emory , sat staring at one of the computer terminals we used for legal research . <p> " What did Mr. C want ? " she asked , running her hand through her thick black hair . <p> I told her about the Dabney case . Her eyes widened . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to bring down a televangelist . " <p> " She 's not a televangelist . More likely she has a little church in a poor area of town . And all I heard was the client 's side of the story . What if Dabney is doing a lot of good ? I do n't want to attack someone who is faithfully serving God . " <p> " I doubt that . She 's probably on a local radio station ranting for thirty minutes on Sunday morning . Can you believe the stuff they let on the air ? You should check it out . I bet she has her own show at seven thirty on Sunday mornings . If she says something defamatory about our client on the air , you could join the radio station as a defendant . " <p> Julie had the creative energy I lacked for this fight . <p> " Maybe you should work on the case . " <p> " I 'd love to . I have no problem busting someone who is using religion as an excuse to harass people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offends me . Feminism only goes so far before stubbing its toe on the Ten Commandments . " <p> I smiled , knowing Julie was kidding . <p> " I saw that , " Julie said . " I 'm friends with a woman rabbi in Atlanta . Does your church have women preachers ? " <p> " Not exactly . A woman can exhort in a meeting with the pastor 's permission . " <p> " What in the world does that mean ? " <p> Before I answered , Zach Mays stuck his head and broad shoulders into the room . <p> " Ready ? " he asked . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Give me ten minutes to talk to Mr. Appleby about a research memo I gave him yesterday . " <p> Zach waved and left . <p> " Joel only looks at me like that after he 's had three glasses of wine , " Julie said . <p> Julie was in the midst of a summer romance with a young freelance photographer . <p> " He always thinks you 're picture-perfect . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you with the Dabney case if you can convince Mr. C to go along with it . We 've done that on a bunch of files already . " <p> " But you do n't know anything about religious fundamentalism . That 's what seemed important to him . " <p> " Do n't be dense . I 've spent countless hours in the same room with you for weeks . I 'm going to be an expert on Christian fanatics by the end of the summer . " She paused . " But Mr. C will be more interested in the research paper I wrote on defamation law in Georgia . " <p> " You did a research paper on libel and slander ? " <p> " I would n't lie about something like that , would I ? " <p> Thirty minutes passed without Zach 's return , and I began to fret he 'd been caught in the Friday afternoon work trap I 'd escaped . An admiralty law specialist , Zach mostly worked with Mr. Appleby , one of the senior partners . For a second-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nonnegotiable . I turned on a computer and tried to pick up a thread of research from earlier in the day . <p> " It 's a good thing Vinny went to Charleston yesterday and wo n't see you sneaking out of town with Zach , " Julie said . <p> " He understands , " I answered , with more confidence than I felt about the summer clerk from Yale . " We 're having lunch on Monday after I get back . " <p> " Even though he 's a geek , Vinny is n't going to let you fall into the arms of another man without a struggle . " <p> " No one is putting his arms around me . " <p> " That 's right . You have a guy on each side pulling you apart like the wishbone of a chicken . " <p> I laughed . Julie knew I 'd toiled the previous five summers in the chicken plant where my father worked as a floor supervisor . <p> " That got your mind off the clock for a few seconds , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zach . <p> " Let 's go , " he said . <p> " Have fun , " Julie said as I quickly grabbed my purse . " And , Zach , leave a trail of bread crumbs so you can find your way out of the mountains . " <p>
