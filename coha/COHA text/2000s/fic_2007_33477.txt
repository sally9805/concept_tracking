1 It looked , Peter Crane thought , like a stork : a huge white stork , rising out of the water on ridiculously delicate legs . But as the helicopter drew closer and the distant outline sharpened against the sea horizon , the resemblance gradually fell away . The legs grew sturdier , became tubular pylons of steel and pre-stressed concrete . The central body became a multi-level superstructure , studded with flare stacks and turbines , festooned with spars and girders . And the thin , neck-like object above resolved into a complex crane-and-derrick assembly , rising several hundred feet above the superstructure . The pilot pointed at the approaching platform , held up two fingers . Crane nodded his understanding . It was a brilliant , cloudless day , and Crane squinted against the bright ocean stretching away on all sides . He felt tired and disoriented by travel : commercial flight from Miami to New York , private Gulfstream G150 charter to Reykjavik , and now helicopter . But the weariness had n't blunted his deep -- and growing -- curiosity . It was n't so much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he could understand . It was the hurry with which they 'd wanted him to drop everything and rush out to the Storm King platform that surprised him . Then there was the fact that AmShale 's forward headquarters in Iceland had , rather oddly , been bustling with technicians and engineers rather than the usual drillers and roughnecks . And then there was the other thing . The helicopter pilot was n't an AmShale employee . He wore a Navy uniform -- and a sidearm . As the chopper banked sharply around the side of the platform , heading for the landing zone , Crane realized for the first time just how large the oil rig was . The jacket structure alone had to be eight stories high . Its upper deck was covered with a bewildering maze of modular structures . Here and there , men in yellow safety uniforms checked couplings and worked pump equipment , dwarfed by the machinery that surrounded them . Far , far below , the ocean frothed and worried around the pillars of the substructure , where it vanished beneath the surface to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chopper slowed , turned , and settled down onto the green hexagon of the landing zone . As Crane reached back for his bags , he noticed that someone was standing at the edge of the LZ , waiting : a tall , thin woman in an oilskin jacket . He thanked the pilot , opened the passenger door , and stepped out into frigid air , ducking instinctively under the whirring blades . The woman held out her hand at his approach . " Dr. Crane ? " Crane shook the hand . " Yes . " " This way , please . " The woman turned and led the way off the landing platform , down a short set of stairs , and along a metal catwalk to a closed , submarine-style hatch . She did not give her name . A uniformed seaman stood guard outside the hatch , rifle at his side . He nodded as they approached , opened the hatch , then closed and secured it behind them . Beyond lay a spacious , brightly-lit corridor , studded along both sides with open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no deep throbbing of derrick equipment . The smell of oil , though detectable , was faint , almost as if efforts had been made to remove it . Crane followed the woman , bags slung over his shoulder , glancing curiously into the rooms as he passed . Once again , curiosity pricked at him : there were laboratories full of whiteboards and workstations ; computer centers ; communications suites . Topside had been quiet , but there was plenty of activity here . Crane decided he 'd venture a question . " Are the divers in a hyperbaric chamber ? " he asked . " Can I see them now ? " " This way , please , " the woman repeated . They turned a corner , descended a staircase , and entered another hallway , even wider and longer than the first . The rooms they passed were larger here : machine shops , storage bays for high-tech equipment Crane did n't recognize . Crane frowned . Although Storm King resembled an oil rig in all outward appearances , it was clearly no longer in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " Have any vascular specialists or pulmonologists been flown in from Iceland ? " he asked . The woman did n't answer , and Crane shrugged . He 'd come this far -- he could stand to wait another couple of minutes . Up ahead , the woman had stopped before a closed door of gray metal . " Mr. Lassiter is waiting for you , " she said . Lassiter ? Crane wondered . That was n't a name he recognized . The person who 'd spoken to him over the phone , briefed him about the problem at the rig , had been named Simon . He glanced at the door . There was the nameplate , white letters on black plastic , spelling out E. Lassiter , External Liaison . Crane turned back to the woman in the oilskin jacket , but she was already moving down the corridor . He shifted his bags , knocked on the door . " Enter , " came the crisp voice from within . E. Lassiter was a tall , thin man with closely-cropped blond hair . He stood up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't wearing a military uniform , but with his haircut and his brisk , economical movements he might as well have been . The office was small and just as efficient-looking as its tenant . The desk was almost studiously bare : there was a single manila envelope on it , carefully sealed , and a digital recorder . " You can stow your gear there , " Lassiter said , indicating a far corner . " Please sit down . " " Thanks . " Crane took the proffered seat . " I 'm eager to learn just what the emergency is . My escort here did n't have much to say on the subject . " " Actually , neither will I. " Lassiter gave a brief smile , which disappeared as quickly as it came . " That will come . My job is to ask you a few questions . " Crane digested this . " Go ahead , " he said after a moment . Lassiter pressed a button on the recorder . " This recording is taking place on June 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the E. R. F. Support and Supply Station . " Lassiter glanced over the desk at Crane . " Dr. Crane , you are aware that your tour of service here can not be fixed to a specific length ? " " Yes . " " And you understand that you must never divulge anything you witness here , or recount your actions while at the Facility ? " " Yes . " " And are you willing to sign an affidavit to that effect ? " " Yes . " " Dr. Crane , have you ever been arrested ? " " No . " " Were you born a citizen of the United States , or are you naturalized ? " " I was born in New York City . " " Are you taking medication for any ongoing physical condition ? " " No . " " Do you abuse alcohol or drugs with any regularity ? " Crane had fielded the questions with growing surprise . " Unless you call the occasional weekend six-pack ' abuse ' , then no . " Lassiter did n't smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " Lassiter put the recorder on pause . Then he picked up the manila envelope , slit it open with a finger , pulled out half a dozen sheets of paper , and passed them across the table . " If you could please read and sign each of these , " he said , plucking a pen from a pocket and placing it beside the sheets . Crane picked them up and began to read . As he did so , his surprise turned to something close to disbelief . There were three separate non-disclosure agreements , an Official Secrets Act affidavit , and something called a Binding Cooperation Initiative . All were branded documents of the U.S. Government ; all required signature ; and all threatened dire consequences if any of their articles were breached . Crane put the documents down . He was uncomfortably aware of Lassiter 's gaze upon him . This was too much . Maybe he should thank Lassiter politely , then excuse himself and head back to Florida . But how , exactly , was he going to do that ? AmShale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him here . The helicopter had already left . He was -- to put it euphemistically -- between research projects at the moment . And besides , he had never been one to turn down a challenge : especially one as mysterious as this . He picked up the pen and , without giving himself time to reconsider , signed all six documents . " Thank you , " Lassiter said . He started the recorder again . " Let the transcript show that Dr. Crane has signed the requisite forms . " Then , snapping off the recorder , he stood . " If you 'll follow me , Doctor , I think you 'll get your answers . " He led the way out of the office and down the corridor , through a labyrinthine administrative area , up an elevator , and into a well-furnished library , stocked with books , magazines , and computer workstations . Lassiter gestured toward a table on the far side of the room , which held only a computer monitor . " I 'll come back for you , " he said , then turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed , watching the door close behind Lassiter . There was nobody else in the library , and he was beginning to wonder what would happen next , when the computer screen winked on in front of him . It showed the face of a grey-haired , deeply tanned man in his late sixties . Some kind of introductory video , Crane thought . But when the face smiled directly at him , he realized he was n't looking at a computer monitor , but a closed-circuit television screen , with a tiny camera embedded in its upper frame . " Hello , Dr. Crane , " the man said . He smiled , his kindly face breaking into a host of creases . " My name is Howard Asher . " " Pleased to meet you , " Crane told the screen . " I 'm the chief scientist of the National Ocean Service . Have you heard of it ? " " Is n't that the ocean-management arm of NOAA ? " " That 's correct . " " I 'm a little confused , Dr. Asher -- it 's Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard . " " Howard . What does the National Ocean Service have to do with an oil rig ? And where 's Mr. Simon , the person who I spoke with on the phone ? The one who arranged all this ? He said he 'd be here to meet me . " " Actually , Dr. Crane , there is no Mr. Simon . But I 'm here , and I 'll be happy to explain what I can . " Crane frowned . " I was told there were medical issues with the divers maintaining the rig 's underwater equipment . Was that a deception , too ? " " Only in part . There has been a lot of deception , and for that I 'm sorry . But it was necessary . We had to be sure . You see , secrecy is absolutely critical to this project . Because what we have here , Peter -- may I call you Peter ?  - -  is the scientific and historical discovery of the century . " " The century ? " Crane repeated , not fully able to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doubtful . But this is no deception , Peter . It 's the last thing from it . Still , ' discovery of the century ' may not be quite accurate . " " I did n't think so , " Crane replied . " I should have called it the greatest discovery of all time . " 2 Crane stared at the image on the viewscreen . Dr. Asher was smiling back at him in a friendly , almost paternal way . But there was nothing in the smile that suggested a joke . " I could n't tell you the truth , Peter , until you were physically here , at the Facility . And until you 'd been fully vetted . We used your travel time to complete that process . Fact is , there 's still much I ca n't tell you , even now . " Crane looked over his shoulder . The library was empty . " Why ? Is n't this line secure ? " " Oh , it 's secure . But we need to know you 're fully committed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What little I can tell you now is nevertheless highly secret . Even if you decline our offer , you will still be bound by all the confidentiality agreements . " " I understand , " Crane said . " Very well . " Asher hesitated . " Peter , the platform you 're on right now is suspended over something more than an oil field . Something much more . " " What 's that ? " Crane asked automatically . Asher smiled mysteriously . " Suffice to say the well drillers on the platform discovered something nearly two years ago . Something so fantastic that , overnight , the platform stopped pumping oil and took on a new and highly secret role . " " Let me guess . You ca n't tell me what it is . " Asher laughed . " No , not yet . But it 's such an important discovery the government is , quite literally , sparing no expense to reclaim it . " " Reclaim ? " " It 's buried in the sea bed directly below this platform . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on here is , in essence , a dig : an archaeological dig like none other . And we are , quite literally , making history . " " But why all the secrecy ? " " Because if people caught wind of what we 've found , it would instantly become front-page news on every paper in the world . In hours , the place would be a disaster area . Half a dozen governments , all claiming sovereignty ; journalists ; rubberneckers . The discovery is simply too critical to be jeopardized that way . " Crane leaned back in his chair , considering . The entire trip was becoming almost surreal . The rushed flight plans , the oil platform that was n't a platform , the veil of secrecy ... and now this face in a box , speaking of an unimaginably important discovery . " Call me old fashioned , " he said , " but I 'd feel a lot better about it if you 'd take the time to see me in person , talk face to face . " " Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the project , though , and you 'll see me soon enough . " " I do n't understand . Why , exactly , is it so difficult ? " Asher chuckled again . " Because at the moment , I 'm several thousand feet beneath you . " Crane stared at the screen . " You mean --  " " Precisely . The Storm King oil platform is just the support structure , the resupply station . The real action is far below . That 's why I 'm speaking to you over this videofeed . " Crane digested this a moment . " What 's down there ? " he asked quietly . " Imagine a huge research station , ten levels high , full of equipment and technology beyond the cutting edge , all sunk into the ocean floor . That 's the ERF -- the heart and soul of the most extraordinary archaeological effort of all time . " " The ERF ? " " Exploratory and Recovery Facility . But we refer to it simply as the Facility . The military -- you know how fond they are of buzzwords -- have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military presence . Why are the soldiers necessary ? " " I could tell you it 's because the Facility is government property , because the NOS is a branch of the government . And that 's true . But the real reason is because a lot of the technology we 're using in the recovery project is classified . " " What about those men I saw topside , working on the rig ? " " Window dressing , for the most part . We do have to look like a functioning oil platform , after all . " " And AmShale ? " " They 've been paid exceptionally well to lease us the rig , act as front office , and ask no questions . " Crane shifted in his chair . " This Facility you mention . That 's where I 'd be quartered ? " " Yes . It 's where all the marine scientists , historians , and engineers live and work . I know how much time you 've spent in submerged environments , Peter , and I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've got to see the place to believe it -- the Facility is a miracle of undersea technology . "
