Hallie Moore looked into the camera lens , a wireless microphone in one hand and a generous strawberry ice cream cone in the other . A crowd was gathering behind her , drawn by the inevitable magnetism of fleeting fame promised by the Channel 7 News Van . And if the truck was n't conspicuous enough , with its " NBN-7 NEWS " logo  --  complete with the stylized lightning bolt seven  --  painted on the front , sides and rear , the microwave dish was raised at the end of the mast , extended to its full height , around forty-two feet , in preparation for their live shot . Hallie smiled when she realized the only way to draw more attention to their location shoot would be to fly a " NBN-7 NEWS " flag beneath the dish like the skull and crossbones of the Jolly Roger . Maybe she 'd suggest that at the next story meeting . Not that she begrudged the attention . Her Hallie 's Comet segments always worked better with an enthusiastic crowd behind her , even if someone eventually gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hallie ! " Simple , but direct and to the point , in Rocky country . Expected variations would be " Hallie , whassup ? " or " Rock on ! " or the old standby maternal acknowledgment , " Hi , Mom ! " Her regular cameraman was lanky Danny " Trips " Horton , his nickname arising from hissomewhat unfortunate and ungainly relationship with his camera 's tripod or any other potential tripping hazard . Most of the station 's reporters , those who fell into news director Eugene Marshall 's " hard news corps " ( his " troops " ) , had rotating camera operators , but Hallie usually made her " Comet " rounds with Trips Horton . Maybe Marshall was punishing one of the " softies "  --  his derisive name for the feature reporters left over from the previous regime  --  with the " clumsy " cameraman , but Hallie enjoyed Horton 's company on the road and , despite his proclivity for unintended pratfalls , he had a homing pigeon 's unerring sense of direction , possessed good story sense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ console . With Trips at the wheel and the console , I never have to worry about missing slot , she thought . What worried her at that moment was the unusual June heat . Her strawberry ice cream cone was beginning to resemble a Dali clock . " Oh , Miss Hallie ! Is no good ! " wailed Rocco DiFranco , owner of Rocco 's Ice Cream Collisions . " You got ta droopy cone ! " " Least of her problems , " Trips Horton said , his mischievous smile a brief flash of white framed by his dark goatee . " Do n't expect an autograph on your next cast , Trips , " Hallie said . Horton was three days out of his second ankle cast in two years . Each time he 'd broken his ankle , he 'd had the entire on-air staff sign his cast . " You think I do n't know what you get for those on eBay . " " Hey , " he said defensively . " They 're legitimate collector 's items . " " Like Jim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's six o'clock coanchor . " I had nothing to do with that , " Trips said . " Please ... Miss Hallie ? " Rocco wrung his hands together within his rainbow-stained apron . " Nobody wants droopy cone . " " Of course not , " Hallie said pleasantly . " We 've got a minute before air . Have Melissa bring me another one . " " Melissa , " Rocco called to one of his teenaged , stripe-smocked employees . " Bring Miss Hallie another strawberry supreme . " The redheaded girl nodded and raced back to the ice cream parlor . Rocco seemed nervous and ecstatic at the same time . " Is really true ? Rocco 's gets one of Miss Hallie 's Comets ? Best ice cream parlor in the whole country . " " It 's true , " Hallie said with an easy smile . " Unfortunately , my Comets only have jurisdiction in the Philadelphia viewing area . " " This is still big . Is big , no ? " " It 's big , yes , " Hallie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underestimate the value of your garbage , Hallie , " Trips added , still dreaming of online auction riches . " You could be throwing away a fortune . " " I thought we left the Dumpster diving to Special Reports . " " Thirty seconds to air , Hallie . " Voice of Reggie Bell , Noon News producer , coming through the IFB earpiece in her right ear . " All set ? " " Thirty , " Hallie said . " I 'm good . " Empty-handed , she thought , but good . Trips nodded . They 'd transmitted the video piece  --  customer and employee comments along with footage of the ice cream shop 's interior  --  to the station already . Hallie would bookend the package with a live intro and closing for the noon telecast . A somewhat edited version of the package would re-air during the five o'clock and eleven o'clock broadcasts . On the crumpled three-by-five index card in her mike hand , Hallie had scrawled the names of several store employees and a few customers . While she prided herself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Better to refer to the card than draw a blank while staring live into the unforgiving camera lens before thousands and thousands of viewers . At least reporters no longer had to worry about the embarrassment of forgetting a roll cue . These days a protracted pause was the cue to roll tape . " Hair ? " she asked . " Tangled mess , " Trips said with a wink . " Teeth ? " she asked , flashing him a broad smile . " Spinach a problem ? " " Of course not , " Hallie said . " Then you 're good . " " Ten seconds . Go to air . " Hallie reached behind her to the radio clipped to her waistband , turned the knob to switch her feed to air . She 'd hear her introduction in the earpiece . If the broadcast stayed true to its stacking , Lynne Vickers would intro Hallie 's segment after the commercial break , with Tim Boyd having teased it before the break . Melissa hurried to Hallie 's side , wearing a nervous smile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , then turned back to the camera . Lynne 's perky voice came over her earpiece. " ... of this heat wave , Tim , everyone wants to know where to find the best ice cream cone in the Delaware Valley . Reporting live , our own Hallie Moore has the answer in today 's Comet sighting . Hallie ? " " Thanks , Lynne , " Hallie said , flashing her broad , natural smile , and showing an ease with the camera the viewers recognized and responded to . With an appreciative glance at the fresh strawberry cone , Hallie continued , " Have to admit , I 've had tougher assignments . But who knew there were so many ice cream flavors , or so many ice cream shops in the Delaware Valley ? Even so , after dozens of cones and an assortment of toppings , I think I 've finally found ice cream nirvana .... " Hallie took a delicate lick of the strawberry ice cream to avoid smearing a comical blob on her nose , and smiled again . " And you 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collisions in Woodbury , New Jersey . " An unrehearsed but raucous cheer rose from the crowd gathered round her at the mention of the town name . Hallie paused , her cue for the station to roll the tape Trips transmitted earlier . She pressed the IFB earpiece with the index finger of her mike hand to hear the tape on air . The mini ice cream shop tour and customer comments ran for about ninety seconds . Hallie listened mostly so she would know when she 'd be live again . She grabbed the large " Hallie 's Comet " cardboard logo from the front seat of the news van and tucked it under her left arm . Somebody was talking behind her . " Go on . Ask her , " Rocco said , shooing Melissa toward Hallie with both hands . " Ready for the collision ? " Melissa asked . " You bet , " Hallie said , smiling to put the girl at ease . Melissa gave a curt nod and ran off to the shop again . Hallie turned to the swelling crowd behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can give a big cheer when I present the comet to Rocco ? " They 'd seen the spots , knew the routine . They gave her a collective , enthusiastic yell . " That the best you can do ? " she asked with a mischievous grin . Much louder , with several fists pumping in the air . " Super . You guys are great . " Trips smiled , shaking his head . Rocco was beaming as Hallie turned back to the camera , just seconds before the tape ended and she was live all over the greater Delaware Valley . " You 're probably asking yourself , ' What 's an ice cream collision ? ' Who better to ask than the owner , Rocco DiFranco . " She nodded toward Rocco , who stepped forward nervously into a two-shot , but was still grinning proudly . " Is simple , " Rocco said . " An ice cream collision is for when you ca n't decide between one flavor and another flavor . " " Understandable , since you offer fifty flavors . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , " Rocco said . " Peach Mango Mondays , Tin Roof Tuesdays , White Chocolate Chip Wednesdays  --  " " Right , " Hallie said , gently interrupting . " But getting back to collisions ... ? " " Right , right ! Collisions . Do n't mind Rocco . I get lost in a phone booth . Collisions are for when you got a big appetite , and you ca n't decide between flavors . " " So , if I ca n't decide between banana and butter almond ... ? " " Right , we make you a collision . Melissa ! Bring Miss Hallie 's collision ! " Melissa had returned to Hallie 's side , just off-camera , with the prearranged sample collision . One cone filled with banana ice cream , with a second cone of butter almond upended on top of the first . The point of the cone stuck out at a jaunty angle , like a party hat . Melissa extended her arm , balancing the cones as she offered them to Hallie . " Thanks , Melissa , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that for a second while I present this Hallie 's Comet Award to Rocco . We were looking for the best ice cream shop in the Delaware Valley and we have a Comet sighting at Rocco 's Ice Cream Collisions in Woodbury , New Jersey . " Hallie handed the cardboard comet logo , with a stylized tail , to a beaming Rocco DiFranco and , per their prearranged instructions , the crowd erupted in cheers and applause . " Thank you , Miss Hallie , " Rocco said , gazing down at the cardboard logo . Later she 'd give him the personalized decal version to place on his store window , with the award-specific information lettered on the ball of the comet , and the date on the flaring tail . After a moment , he held it over his head , eliciting another roar of approval from the crowd . Turning back to the camera , and the watching audience , Hallie said , " There you have it , folks . Another Hallie 's Comet sighting . In Woodbury , this is Hallie Moore . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallie . Enjoy your collision . " " Count on it , " Hallie said , taking the double cones from Melissa . Lynne addressed the television audience . " Find out more about Rocco 's and the four other Comet finalists for best ice cream shop on our NBN-7 website . Just click on the Hallie 's Comet logo with the link that says ' Comet Tales , ' then  --  " Hallie switched her radio back from air . A moment later Noon News producer Reggie Bell said , " You 're clear , Hallie . " Hallie turned to the crowd . " Thanks , everyone ! You were great . " With a sigh of reluctance , she handed the banana and butter almond collision back to Melissa . Rocco took Hallie 's free hand in both of his and squeeze-pumped . " Thank you so much . " " You 're very welcome , Rocco . " Trips leaned toward her , his bulky video camera tucked under one arm , and said , " What say we break down and grab lunch . Found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lunchtime errand today . " " Suit yourself , but you 'll miss out on a Grande Margarita . " " Some other time , " she said , distracted . With the opportunity for television fame over , most of the crowd had dispersed . Several people edged closer , hoping to get Hallie 's autograph or take her picture if they happened to have a camera on them . Clutching a ballpoint pen but lacking paper , one teenaged guy had Hallie sign the back of his hand . With the autograph seekers satisfied , Hallie swapped the oversized cardboard Hallie 's Comet logo for the window decal version . After Trips stowed his video camera and lowered the microwave dish mast , he stood beside her , hands in his rear pockets , and said , " Drop you off at the station ? " Hallie 's red Toyota Camry was in the station 's parking lot . " Or , if you want , I can chauffeur you . " " No thanks , Trips , " she said , her easy smile fading away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tom Galloway unbuckled the booster seat in the back of the Ford Explorer and helped his son Shane down from the midnight blue SUV . As soon as his feet hit the asphalt parking lot , Shane started toward the kindergarten entrance . " Hold on , Partner ! Are n't you forgetting something ? " Tom said . He reached across the seat for Shane 's backpack , decorated with images of Lugia , Charizard , Pikachu , and a half dozen other Pokemon characters whose names Tom had yet to memorize . The backpack was light enough for a six-year-old : Shane 's lunch and juice box , an activity folder , and probably a select group of Pokemon action figures . " Oh , yeah , " Shane said , embarrassed . Tom held the backpack as Shane slipped his arms through the straps . " Do n't forget , " Tom said . " Mrs. Selby will get you after school . You can play at her house until I pick you up . Okay ? " " Okay . " " Best behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good , " Tom said . He swallowed hard . " So what kind of day you gon na have ? " " A super day ! " Shane shouted . " That 's what I like to hear , " Tom said , ruffling the boy 's light brown hair as they walked toward the building 's entrance , where other parents and their children had begun to assemble . A couple of school buses had pulled to the curb , doors squeaking open . Kids were talking and boasting , laughing , an errant bump here , a frustrated shove there , which invoked a parental scolding , and endless chatter about cartoons , superheroes , video games , and other social concerns of the very young . Tom looked down at his son and frowned . Shane seemed more subdued than usual , his recent enthusiasm a bit forced , as if for Tom 's benefit . Tom had n't made a big deal about the significance of the day , even though it weighed on his mind . Maybe Shane sensed Tom 's melancholy and was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less frequently than a year ago , but they happened , sometimes with no apparent cause . The truth of it was always there beneath the surface . They lived in the same house and there were always reminders of what they had lost . Tom had no conscious recollection of the drive to ShowStopper Productions ; the etched silver sign appeared much sooner than he would have thought possible , the demarcation of a foreign land . These are the days you live outside yourself , Tom thought . A stranger in your own life , removed from the stream of human events . A living ghost , adrift and confused . He entered the sprawling , single-story office building with the attached warehouse , waved and nodded where appropriate , wondering if anyone was surprised to see him today . What the hell am I doing here ? he asked himself more than once . Autopilot steered him toward his office , let him field questions from the shop foreman and the manager of the graphic arts department . When actual thought was required , he promised to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memos , e-mail , and blueprints scattered across his desk , his office was impersonal , even generic , save for one framed photograph of Shane and him taken by a stranger at the dinosaur garden outside Camden 's Adventure Aquarium . Tom was leaning against the hadrosaur while Shane was climbing out of a broken egg , a newly hatched dino-boy . Tom logged into his computer , but found himself staring at the Excel production worksheets . Most of his exhibits were on schedule , a few needed his attention , but Tom had trouble focusing . The numbers were an incomprehensible jumble before his eyes , a Rosetta stone yet to be deciphered . His hand had drifted to the drawer of his mahogany credenza , and his fingers slipped through the handle . Slowly , he opened the drawer . His free hand trembled as he reached for the other framed photograph that had adorned his desk for years , but now lay facedown in the drawer . Taking a deep breath , he turned the photograph over . His first reaction was a smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more beautiful than he remembered . Her ash blond hair was stylish but short and " practical , " as she 'd described it . She was wearing a white cotton blouse , and her wide green eyes and pink lips were mere spots of color amid the blooming garden around her . She stared back at him , as if about to say his name , but she was lost in time , forever beyond his reach . " I miss you , Heather , " he said , his voice a harsh echo of a whisper . We all miss you . It 's not  --  not ... Shane should have a mother . Grief flared into a familiar rage . The bastard who killed you should be burning in hell . But they 'd never caught the guy . Never came close . Tom sighed , his body trembling as if to shake off the anger . Staring at Heather 's face , he imagined another face beside hers , an identical face , and wondered how Hallie was surviving today , the one-year anniversary of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blue Route , she fell into a self-induced trance . Almost missed the exit . Wondering if , subconsciously , she was trying to avoid her lunchtime appointment with the past . She waited to turn left at the traffic light , forgetting to signal her intention . The light blinked to green and she made the turn , steered into the right lane , turning her gaze to the shoulder and the guardrail beyond , looking for the exact spot . Moments later , she saw it . A white cross , just beyond the guardrail , adorned with a garland of fresh flowers . Not as many as there had been a year ago . Many had forgotten about her . Others would never forget . A few had experienced a piece of themselves die that same day . But how could it be any worse than for Hallie ? Several feet from the wooden cross , Hallie swung her red Camry onto the shoulder of the highway , shifted into park , then climbed out of the car on numb legs , clutching a fresh bouquet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead ? she wondered . That would certainly be more traditional . And yet , somehow , she felt connected to this horrible place now , charged with a preternatural energy Hallie sensed but could never explain . An energy that connected Hallie not with the tragedy , but with the ... essence of her twin sister . Some quacks and charlatans claimed to speak to the dead . A cemetery , a graveyard plot , seemed the natural place to commune with lost loved ones , while standing within ten feet of their earthly remains .... Made sense , almost . Hallie had visited Heather 's grave site a couple times but had felt no connection beyond acknowledging her sister 's name and vital dates carved on a smooth marble tombstone . Heather 's physical remains were there , but her energy  --  whether you called it a spirit , a soul , or an aura  --  was long gone from that mourning place , if it had ever been there . At the roadside memorial marking the location of Heather 's violent murder , Hallie sensed that energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were otherwise . It troubled her to think that something of Heather was forced to remain here . Deep down , Hallie recognized that this energy should move on , if that was even possible , so that Heather 's spirit could be at peace . Maybe it was Hallie who trapped Heather 's spirit here , by not letting go , by wanting and needing her to stay . Hallie felt so lost without Heather in her world . But how much worse her desolation if she surrendered this last fragile link to her twin . Hallie just could n't let go . Not yet ... Softly , " I miss you so much , Heather ... " As Hallie crouched to place her bouquet of flowers  --  pink lilies and carnations , peach daisies and lemon leaves  --  under the guardrail just in front of the white-painted cross , she noticed that the cross was tilted a bit to the right . Instinctively , she reached out to straighten it , as she would have adjusted a crooked painting on a wall . " This is n't right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe , Heather could hear her ... or maybe just hoping to comfort herself . " I have to fix this . " Her fingertips brushed against the polished wood  --  and she gasped in shock . A flash of white light enveloped her hands . A painful jolt of energy  - -   - -   wrenched her arms in their sockets , contorting  - -   - -   her spine and whipping  - -   - -   her head back and slamming  - -   - -   her jaw shut ! Slowly , on trembling legs , she stood erect ... staring straight ahead without seeing the wild meadow in front of her . Instead , she relived another 's memory , her mind no longer hers alone . ... flashing blue light washes across her skin , gleams across the hunting knife ... ... scrape of boot heels on asphalt ... ... he 's not what she assumed  --  a horrible mistake  --  run ! ... she 's sprinting through high grass , her breathing ragged , her scream coming out as a wailing moan  --  burning line down her back  --  the knife ! He 's sliced her back open  - -  She stumbles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the smothering weight of him dropping over her  --  **26;1718;TOOLONG  --  she scrambles out from under him , but he snags her ankle in his gloved hand . Pain-fire flares down the back of her thigh  --  another slash of the knife ! His forearm slams against the back of her neck and she falls flat , gasping into a mouthful of grass and dirt  --  his body presses against hers  --  hand grabs at her short hair , tugs , pulls , yanks her head back . Cold knife , warmed with her own blood , against her throat . " Make a sound and you die ! " ( But she 's already dead , Hallie knows ... ... it just has n't happened yet . ) " Understand  --  bitch ? " She tries to nod  --  but the sharp edge of the knife bites into the tender skin of her throat  --  and she freezes . The knife leaves her throat . He pins her to the ground with his knees , his other hand snarled in her hair . A moment later , the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waistband of her drawstring yoga pants before tearing them away . The turquoise camisole she wore for her yoga class yields next , then the knife tip gouges into her hip as he hurriedly rips away her panties .... She is trapped in a blue-strobed darkness , each brutalized second  --  white-hot pain  --  lasting an eternity . Then , mercifully , her world begins to spin away . Her throat burns , first from her own harsh breathing and racking sobs , then again with the edge of the blade . He whispers in her ear , " See ya later , alligator ! " and pulls left to right in a deep , deep cut .... ( No  --  NO ! Hallie recoils inside herself , pulling away . She must not ... ) Drowning in darkness then , darkness gorged with a cold , shivering loneliness of the soul as awareness fades , she desperately clings to images that remain bright long after everything else slides into the abyss , images of Hallie , and Tom , and Shane .... Continues ...      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
