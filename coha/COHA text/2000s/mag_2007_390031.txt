Headnote After fighting neglected diseases in Africa for a quarter century , former president Jimmy Carter takes on one of the continent 's biggest killers-malaria His once-sandy hair had gone all white ; his shoulders were a bit more stooped ; his freckled face was lined with new creases . But Jimmy Carter 's 82 years had diminished neither his trademark smile , which could still disarm skeptics at 20 paces , nor his enthusiasm for the long chance , which had propelled this obscure peanut farmer to national prominence in the first place . That quixotic spirit took him this past February to an impoverished corner of Ethiopia , where he would announce his most audacious crusade yet : to eliminate malaria , an elusive and ever-changing killer , from this ancient African nation of 75 million people . Now rare in developed countries , the disease kills more than a million victims each year in the world 's poorest regions . At least 300 million people worldwide are incapacitated by malaria infections . The disease 's aches , fever , chills and other flulike symptoms not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its victims , making them more susceptible to tuberculosis and AIDS-both of which kill even more people than malaria does-and other life-threatening ailments . " We can control malaria-absolutely , " Carter was saying , standing in the dusty courtyard of a clinic in the village of Afeta . Vultures wheeled overhead , and farmers in faded clothes lined up to receive new mosquito nets from the hands of the former president . Dressed in a blue plaid shirt and blue jeans festooned with a silver " J.C . " belt buckle , Carter noticed an old woman struggling to unpack her net . He pulled out a pocketknife , sliced open the heavy plastic packaging and presented the net to her . " There you are , " he said , flashing the smile . The nets , treated with long-lasting insecticide , cost $5 each , but the villagers got them free , courtesy of the Atlanta-based Carter Center , the Ethiopian government and a host of other donors . While the villagers collected their nets , an entourage of reporters , documentary filmmakers , secret Service agents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president and Nobel Peace Prize winner , who had been making foreign forays like this one - to fight disease , monitor elections and defuse international conflict-since founding the Carter Center with his wife , Rosalynn , in 1982 . " Most of those who die from malaria are little children , 1 to 5 years old , " Carter said as villagers huddled nearby , deploying their umbrellas against the rising heat . " It 's been around so long that people have become inured to it . We hope to demonstrate that we can do away with malaria in a major country . It will be an example to other countries of what can be done . " Carter and his colleagues have already demonstrated what can be done in 17 African countries to prevent or treat debilitating diseases such as Guinea worm , trachoma , lymphatic filariasis , schistosomiasis and river blindness . All are classified by the World Health Organization as " neglected tropical illnesses . " " What that means is that they can be prevented or eliminated with proper treatment , " Carter told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developed world . In just a few years we 've almost eliminated Guinea worm , which has gone from three and a half million cases down to about 25,000-a 99.3 percent decrease . We treat about ten million people a year to prevent onchocerciasis , or river blindness . We 're making progress with trachoma , which is the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world . We 're helping to train a corps of healthcare workers through seven universities here in Ethiopia , so that even people in the most remote areas will have access to treatment . The success with these programs gives me confidence that we can have some impact on malaria . " CARTER HAD COME too late to help little Amzia Abdela , a 2-year-old who died in 2006 . She had lived deep in southwest Ethiopia , where farmers still turn the earth with wooden plows and plodding oxen , where goats sleep in red dirt roads and hornhills flap languidly from banana trees . " She was shivering , " recalled the girl 's father , Abdela Abawori , a farmer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot fever and a headache . Her joints were aching . My daughter was sick for almost two months . By the time we called the malaria worker , it was too late . " We conversed through Abate Tilahun , a program officer in the Carter Center 's Addis Ababa headquarters . Abate , soft-spoken and courtly , translated from English to Amharic , a musical tongue with Semitic roots that is the official language of Ethiopia . In short order , Abate had established that Abdela and his wite , Nefisa , 35 , have six other children , including a boy born the month before . In a few weeks , the rains would come again , and Abdela would plant his maize . I asked about last year 's harvest . " Abdela says he grows 1,300 pounds of maize a year , " Abate said . " That sounds pretty good . " " Uh , no , it 's not nearly enough , " said Abate . " He says the family will suffer . They need at least 2,600 pounds to get by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . " Abdela was painfully thin , his face lined with wrinkles , making him appear much older than his 40 years . He had straw in his hair , and he wore ragged pants held together by patches . Rubber boots flapped around his skinny legs , and his double-breasted coat was ripped at the shoulder . Yet he was uncomplaining and dignified , an upright man who had already lived through a vicious Marxist regime , followed by years of turmoil , drought , war and now a young death in the family . He had learned to take the blows and carry on , as resilient as Ethiopia itself . Like many in this proud country , Abdela knew that Ethiopia has never been colonized by foreign powers . It also has its own ancient script , its own branch of the Orthodox Church , even its own way of keeping time-by the Ethiopian calendar it is 1999 and its millennium is still in the future . " These things make us unique , " said Teshome Gebre , a resolutely buoyant man who heads up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also claim to be the source of humanity-not only for Africa but for the entire world because of Lucy , " he said , referring to the 3.2-million-year-old hominid fossil , Australopithecus afaremis , discovered in northeast Ethiopia in 1974 . Abdela led me uphill , past fenced gardens and scraggly coffee trees , arriving at a truncated summit where he pointed to a pebbly mound of earth sprouting weeds . " She 's just here , " he said . He took a step around the little grave , not a yard long . " My mother is here with her , " he added , indicating an older burial at right angles to the first . Neither was marked . The sounds of morning wafted up the hillside-children laughing , plowmen whistling to their oxen , roosters crowing in the sun . Abdela uprooted the weeds obscuring his daughter 's grave and threw them aside . " I miss her , " he said softly . " Of course I have a strong feeling of losing my daughter . I think about her and I fear for my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " He says almost all of his children have been attacked by the malaria . Others could die . " Elsewhere in Ethiopia , I would meet parents who had great expectations for their children , as prospective doctors , teachers , lawyers . Abdela 's ambition was more basic - he simply wanted his children to live . That was enough for now . Abdela led me to his little house , where two goats were tethered by the entrance and smoke from a cooking tire coiled toward the sky . His 4-year-old daughter , Adia , rushed out to greet us . He scooped her up in one arm , and with the other threw back the frayed cloth flap that served as his front door . He ushered me into his darkened house , where I could make out two new mosquito nets hanging in the gloom . The whole family had been sleeping under them for a week . During that time , Abdela had made an important discovery . " When I woke up after the first night , " he said , eyes widening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Dead flies too ! " BY THE TIME Carter arrived in Ethiopia in February , the first of 20 million bed nets were in country-roughly two for each household in malarial areas - dispatched by airplane , truck , bus and even donkey cart . Prime Minister Meles Zenawi , a longtime supporter of Carter 's Ethiopian initiatives , had agreed that his government would distribute 17 million nets ; the Carter Center would hand out the remaining 3 million in areas where it operated other health programs . Under an agreement with the Ethiopian government , the Carter Center will monitor the nation 's malaria program until 2015 , by which time it is hoped that epidemics of the disease will be relegated to a chapter of Ethiopian history The Carter Center 's cost would be $47 million , one ot the organization 's biggest investments ever . Since the late 1800s , it has been known that bed nets could prevent malaria by shielding humans from marauding Anopheles mosquitoes . The female mosquitoes , which make their rounds by night , inject victims with malaria parasites . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most dangerous is Plasmodium falciparum . They lodge in the liver , where they remain dormant for a period often days or so before flooding into the bloodstream . There they destroy red blood cells by the tens of thousands , which triggers the characteristic symptoms : " Coldness overtakes the whole body Tremors . . . accompany the cold sensations , beginning with the muscles of the lower jaw . . . . The expression has meanwhile changed : the face is pale or livid ; there are dark rings under the eyes ; the features are pinched and sharp , and the whole skin shrunken , " according to a 1911 account , still accurate today Most of the 300 million to 500 million people infected worldwide survive a malaria attack , which may arm them with a resistance that makes future attacks less debilitating . In some cases , the parasite remains in the body and emerges weeks or even years later to cause a relapse ; perhaps 15 percent of cases in Ethiopia are recurring . If you could avoid the insect 's bite , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanketing Ethiopia add a high-tech twist to the old protective strategy : they not only block the insects , but , as Abdela Abawori had discovered , they kill any that come in contact with the nets . They have the insecticide deltamethrin woven into the mesh , and with no apparent risk to humans , they retain their mosquito-killing potency for up to seven years . Carter explained : " We first got involved with bed nets in Nigeria , where we 've used more than 100,000 to control lymphatic filariasis , or elephantiasis . The problem with the old nets was that they had to be reimpregnated every year . So you had to go back into every village and every home to keep the nets working . It was an almost insurmountable problem . This new technology makes it a one-shot deal . It does n't just repel mosquitoes - it kills them . It kills them ! This would not have been possible several years ago . " Carter 's organization is not the only one to deploy this latest armament in the mosquito wars . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American business groups and charities , is distributing more than a million new insect-killing nets in other African countries . President Bush has launched a five-year , $1.2 billion initiative against the disease , to help purchase and distribute new nets , to provide malarial drugs for treatment and prevention during pregnancy , to spray insecticide indoors and to boost public education . Others have stepped up with financial commitments for a worldwide campaign : the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria has promised $2.6 billion for nets and drugs ; the World Bank $357 million in loans for affected countries ; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation $303.7 million for research on vaccines . The new attention would help the former president 's fundraising efforts . " I have absolute confidence in our Ethiopian project , as much as I have had in anything we 've done , " he said . " We 're not just doing it spasmodically , just giving out nets in one village and skipping others . We 're going everywhere . We 're doing it comprehensively . " A few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solicit contributions for his Ethiopian campaign and to resume a busy schedule , commenting on the passing political scene , teaching a Sunday school class in his native Plains , Georgia , and writing books . He has written more than 20 since leaving the White House , many of them bestsellers . His latest , provocatively titled Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid , created a storm of protest for criticizing Israel - and expressing sympathy for the Palestinians - and led to several resignations from the advisory board of the Carter Center . IT IS TOO SOON to tell if Carter 's malaria crusade will succeed . But the organization 's track record suggests cause for hope on a continent where that can be rare . After Carter departed Ethiopia , I remained behind to see how his colleagues were handling established campaigns against river blindness and trachoma , two devastating diseases that have long plagued this country of rumpled mountains and foaming rivers . Those rivers were part of the problem . Day after day , I saw women doing their wash in the swift current , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slurping from the river . The same waters were home to a black fly of the Simulium species , a nasty little customer that cut a wide swath in Ethiopia , infecting more than 3 million people with onchocerciasis , or river blindness , and placing some 7.3 million at risk for the disease . The flies feed on human blood . In the process , they infect their hosts with the parasite Onchocerca volvulus , which gives the disease its scientific name . Once inside a person , the wormlike parasites live for up to 15 years , producing millions of little worms called microfilariae . These crawl under the skin , causing inflammation , lesions , intense itching and a mottling of the epidermis known as " leopard skin . " In severe or prolonged cases , they may migrate to the eyes , causing impaired vision or blindness . By the time 78-year-old Mekonen Leka turned up at the Afeta health clinic in February , he was complaining of blurred vision and intense discomfort . His bony shins and ankles were spotted with the white blotches characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his legs from constant scratching . " I feel like there 's something crawling around under my skin , " he said , reaching for a sharp stick to dig at his shins once more . He sat propped against a tree , his legs splayed before him , telling his story : he was infected six years ago , while planting coffee near the river ; the itching kept him from sleeping ; that , in turn , kept him from working ; one of his children took care of him ; he could still see well enough to get around , but he worried that his eyesight would get worse . " It makes me very weak , " said Mekonen . " I have come to the clinic to beg for medication to stop the itching , " he said . The medication was ivermectin , a drug originally developed for deworming cattle and dogs and now produced for people as Mectizan by Merck &; Co. , which donates the doses . In 2006 alone , the Carter Center distributed more than 2.5 million treatments to Ethiopians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug does not kill the adult worms , but it controls the spread of their offspring , which gives patients like Mekonen immediate relief from itching . More important , it will ensure that his vision would deteriorate no further . He would have to wait a few weeks for the drug , when area health clinics planned a massive treatment . I witnessed several of these drug campaigns , which were run and attended by Africans . The events were announced in local markets and promoted on posters , resulting in hundreds of patients showing up for medicine on a specified day . Nobody just pocketed his pills and went home , but swallowed them under the watchful eye of health workers who dutifully recorded each patient 's name in a bound ledger , measured his or her height with a wooden stick , and determined the proper dosage accordingly . " Our number one complaint is still malaria , " said Yeshimebet Moges , the chief nurse at the Afeta health clinic , where patients were lined up 30 deep for afternoon checkups . " But we 're seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get the treatment ; the complaints disappear . And there 's a side benefit-a lot of people have discovered that the medicine also gets rid of intestinal worms and other parasites , which can be a big problem for children . Our patients are really grateful - they bring us coffee , bananas , avocados , oranges . " A few satisfied customers have even named their children Mectizan , a tribute to the drug that healed them . Mectizan means that millions of children will not go blind or know the misery that onchocerciasis has visited on their elders . With luck , a new generation might be well enough to attend school instead of suffering at home or staying there to nurse a sick parent . " If one family member is taken out of production because of sickness , it affects the whole family and eventually the economic development of Ethiopia , " saidTeshome Gebre . " This is one of the reasons we have a poor country . You need healthy working people if you want to reach the dream of economic progress . " IT HAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough to work . The widowed mother of three sons had contracted trachoma , a bacterial infection occurring throughout Ethiopia , and now she suffered from trichiasis , a late stage of the disease that affects a million Ethiopians and requires immediate surgery to preserve sight ; another 15 million to 20 million have an early phase of the ailment , which can usually be arrested by antibiotics . " My eyes started hurting two years ago , " she told me , as we sat outside a village clinic in Merawi , a dot on the map in northwestern Ethiopia . Along with several hundred patients , she was awaiting eye surgery . " The pain has become unbearable , " she said , tightening a white cotton shawl around her head to screen out the sunlight . " I have trouble cooking for my family because the smoke irritates my eyes . Sometimes I can find a neighbor to help me sometimes I just have to go to the kitchen and endure the pain because there 's nobody else to teed my family . I ca n't sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . It I do , then I ca n't open them because of the pain . " She had them closed as we spoke . The disease , known from ancient times , is transmitted by flies or spread from person to person . The vector , a fly known as Musca sorbens ( cousin to our familiar housefly , good old Musca domcstica ) , swarms around the eyes and runny noses of children , feeding on the moisture and leaving behind a microorganism called Chlamydia trachomatis . Infections from the microorganism settle under the eyelids , which become inflamed and thickened . With time the lids begin to scar from the inside , causing them to curl in upon themselves . When this happens , inverted eyelashes begin to scratch the cornea , which eventually clouds over like frosted glass , causing blindness . In Ethiopia , where the disease is known as " hair in the eye , " the ailment afflicts primarily children and the women who care tor them . " It is very much an illness of gender , " said Mulat Zerihun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trachoma programs for the sprawling Amhara region . He worked his way through a sea of patients waiting to he screened in the Merawi clinic . When he came to Sintayhu Tegegn , he pulled his magnifying goggles into position , cupped her chin in his hands and tilted her head up . Like many suffering from late-stage trichiasis , Sintayhu had found respite by plucking her eyelashes with tweezers , which more than a few patients wore like amulets around their necks . " Pulling the lashes helps for a day or so , " Mulat said , hut then they grow back , sharp and bristly , and they scratch the eyes worse than before . Mulat peeled back Sintayhu 's eyelids , studied her for a moment and announced a verdict : " Both eyes will be all right . There 's no clouding on the cornea . You will feel a lot better in a few days . " Mulat plunged back into the silent crowd while Sintayhu 's 15-year-old son led her into a small room where surgeons were already at work on one patient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wondie , 34 , an ophthalmic nurse suited up in a surgeon 's cap , mask and latex gloves . She settled Sintayhu on the table , draped her face with a sterile cloth and told her to hold steady . After injecting each eyelid with local anesthetic , Mitikie went to work : she threaded a needle through theupper lid of one eye , pulled it up with a loop of silk and slid in a stainless steel retractor to hold the lid in place ; with a scalpel , she made a small incision along the margin of the lid and the tarsal conjunctiva ; this relieved tension on the damaged eyelid , which allowed her to unfold the eyelid , treeing it from scraping against the cornea ; with the lid restored to its proper position , Mitikie closed the incision , squeezed antibacterial ointment in the eye and patched it down with gauze , repeating the process on Sintayhu 's other eye . All through the i2-minute operation , Sintayhu lay barefoot and unflinching on the table , watched over by four surgical assistants who handed equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened intently as Mitikie described what she was doing . The assistants were in training , and would soon be allowed to perform a few operations under Mitikie 's supervision . " We 'll probably perform 40 surgeries in this clinic today , " Mulat said , " and another 40 down the road in Dur Bete . We could do more , but we 're giving these young people exposure to training , so they will be able to do what Sister Mitikie does . " His honorific title for Mitikie referred to her position as a nurse , not to holy orders . When he praised her , she shrugged , pulled on fresh gloves and went to work on a new patient , one of the 67,000 trachoma surgeries the Carter Center has coordinated in Ethiopia since 2000 . Sintayhu , meanwhile , was ready for home . She stood a little unsteadily , her eyes taped with gauze , and called for her shoes , pointed and black with red stars on each toe . She pulled her shawl protectively over her head , locked arms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on one side , a niece on the other and a neighbor following , Sintayhu navigated a passageway crowded with patients , stepped gingerly into the clinic 's sunbaked courtyard and disappeared through agate . Now maybe she could sleep . The eye-saving surgery at Merawi and other rural clinics was but one component in Carter 's multifaccted campaign against trachoma . The Carter Center also works with the Ethiopian Health Ministry and volunteer groups such as Lions Club International to distribute antibiotics from Pfizer , Inc. , which has donated 5.5 million doses of Zithromax , its version of azithromycin . The drug not only arrests trachoma but also knocks out a wide range of other ailments , among them scabies , lice and the respiratory infections that haunt children . The trachoma initiative also includes a public education campaign emphasizing the importance of face washing and hygiene in preventing the disease . To encourage such washing , the Carter Center and the Lions Club have drilled more than 119 community wells in the region . And in order to stop trachoma at its source , the former president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be known as the president who negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel , " Jimmy Carter told a recent gathering of health workers in Addis Ababa . " Now I 'm known as the number one latrine builder in the world . " The flies transmitting trachoma breed in human feces . In the fields where they spend all day and sanitary facilities are unknown , farmers have traditionally squatted behind any convenient bush or maize plot . " As you can see , we live in a big country , " Mulat said as we drove through yellow fields and lumpy mountains bordering Lake Tana , where the Blue Nile uncoils on its long journey toward Sudan . " Our tradition is to defecate outside in the fresh air under the sky . This is what the farmers have always done . " Farmers were indignant a few years back when Mulat began talking about the link between trachoma , flies and toilet habits , and suggested that latrines could help . " Why should we change ? " Mulat recalled them asking . " Our ancestors did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been to cities . Their latrines smell terrible ! " To answer such complaints , Mulat staged latrine-building workshops in a few communities , with raffles . " The lucky winner got a latrine , " Mulat said . Neighbors did the construction , using simple materials such as saplings and cornstalks . " Once people saw how the latrines worked and they started using them , they reallv liked them-especially the ladies . " In this conservative region , women had been suffering for years because it was a cultural taboo for them to defecate in daylight , when they could be seen . " It brought shame and ridicule on your family , " Mulat said . " They basically had to go to the bathroom at night , which could be very inconvenient . " With women leading the charge , latrine fervor soon swept the Amhara region , where more than 300,000 new household privies have been built since 2002 , far beyond the 10,000 that health officials initially had in mind . Neighbors competed to see who could build the best one . Having visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , it was with some trepidation that I made the half-hour hike down a broken boulder field , across a sluggish creek and up into the scrubby hills near Lake Tana to meet Wallegne Bizvayehu , a farmer who proudly showed me his family privy , one of 300 new sanitary facilities in his village of 6,000 . It was a simple structure about ten tcet deep and three feet wide , with airy walls of woven maize stalks and a slanting thatched roof lined with an orange plastic tarp . Wallegne 's outhouse was a clean , odorless , well-swept building , with thin bars of sunlight shining through the walls , and not a fly in sight-an island of " unaccustomed privacy in a village of barking dogs , farm chores and family obligations . " Since we built it I believe we 've been healthier , " Wallegne said . " We 've decreased our visits to the nurse 's station . " Inspired by Wallegne 's example , three neighbors were building new latrines . " They 'll build them themselves , " Wallegne said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " THIS SEEMED TO ME the salient lesson of Jimmy Carter 's efforts in Ethiopia , where Africans were helping Africans . The former president made the high-level contacts with prime ministers and health officials , then went home to raise the contributions . He gathered a small but talented technical staff in Atlanta to supervise and plan projects . But they remained largely invisible on the ground in Africa , where the recent history of charity has been written in overblown promises , unrealized dreams and squandered billions . " Most of the money spent on foreign aid never gets to the suffering people , " Carter told me . " It goes to the bureaucrats and to wasteful contractors . There 's data showing that for every $100 in available aid tor the control of disease and suffering in Africa , only $20 gets to the people who need it . " Determined to improve upon that record , Carter ( a notoriously frugal child of the Great Depression ) has kept his expenses low , infrastructure small , accounting systems rigorous and expectations reasonable . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been happy to take small steps , to build upon them and to let local people take credit for the programs that work . In Ethiopia , he has drafted respected professionals such as Teshome Gebre and Mulat Zerihun , who built their own network of indigenous helpers . These villagers were the ones who went to the markets and made the announcements of forthcoming clinics , kept the records , dispensed the medicine , trained the nurses and performed the eye surgeries . " That is the key to success , " said Carter . " We do n't come in to impose something on a country . We get invited . We help . But all the work gets done by local people .
