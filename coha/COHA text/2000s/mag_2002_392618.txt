Earnings over the past decade improved by an average of 25% a year . But if anyone has the pedigree to continue such success , it 's Collins , who spent eight years as chief operating officer before jumping into his new role last May . So far , the Collins era looks equally promising . Medtronic has a pipeline filled with treatments for underserved , yet profitable markets . Its Activa device , for example , which uses electronic stimulation to alleviate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration , and its InSync system is one of the only nonpharmaceutical treatments for heart failure , a condition that affects more than five million Americans .

MONEY writer Adrienne Carter sat down with Collins at the company 's Minneapolis headquarters to discuss Medtronic 's plans . Q. Some health-care stocks have been hit because they have few products in development . How is Medtronic positioned ? A. The fundamentals at Medtronic today are as strong as they have ever been . We just announced our fourth-quarter revenues , which were up 18% . And our new product pipeline is as full as it 's ever been . Q. What is Medtronic 's longterm growth strategy ? A. We have always used biomedical engineering to address large chronic disease states . Most recently , we have expanded into several large markets . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be congestive heart failure . Another would be Parkinson 's disease . Some have been accessed through very selective acquisitions . A current example would be moving into diabetes through the acquisitions of MiniMed and MRG . We 're not a conglomerate , so we do n't go into areas we do n't know . We 're leveraging our core technology , the electronic stimulation used in pacemakers , to treat many more conditions . Q. How has that strategy paid off ? A. If you look at the momentum that we have in the business currently , compared with four years ago , the momentum is much stronger . We have also improved our market share . In our largest business , cardiac rhythm managment , which makes up about 46% of Medtronic 's revenues , we have increased market share in all major segments-pacemakers , implantable cardio defibrillators and other related products . We have also expanded into new therapies ; the most dramatic of those is for congestive heart failure . In cardiac rhythm management , we are the world leader , with in excess of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate . The only major segment in which market share is not as high is in our vascular business , where we 're working through some issues associated with intellectual property . Q. What bane been the problems in the vascular division ? A. Last fall we withdrew an angioplasty catheter from the market after an arbitration panel found that it infringed upon a Boston Scientific patent . In the next two quarters , revenue growth in the vascular division will be hit hard . Earnings in that business were down 16% last quarter . Vascular represents 14% of total revenues , so it 's an important business , and we are confident we will strengthen it . Q. How ? A. We have a replacement product under development and expect to introduce it in the first part of the next calendar year . We also brought in new leadership . Bill Hawkins , the new vascular president , has 25-plus years of experience . He 's only been with us for five months , but he 's already made significant improvements to streamline operations . Q. Medtronic 's vascular division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce a drug-coated stent . How do you respond to that ? A. We did not move as rapidly as Johnson &; Johnson . We 're now rectifying that . We 're hard at work to get a product through clinical trials and into the market that we think has the potential to be an improvement over Johnson &; Johnson 's first-generation product . We estimate that sometime in 2004 is realistic for our product . Q. Will it be hard to break into the market at that point ? A. At one point Johnson &; Johnson owned the coronary stent market . You 've seen everyone 's market share move up and down . Market share can swing very rapidly Q. What sort of growth can we expect from Medtronic in the future ? A. We 're looking for a minimum of 15% growth a year in the top and bottom line over any five-year period . Q. Which major markets have the biggest potential ? A. Heart failure could be a $1 billion business in the next five years . Implantable defibrillators is an underserved market . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very large medical problem . The response has been very strong on our new insulin pump , the Paradigm pump . But only 15% of the market has been penetrated , so we have a major job ahead of us to communicate the benefits of our product . Q. With a PIE of 28 , Medtronic is one of the priciest health-care stocks around . Does Medtronic justify such valuations ? A. For investors , the stock is only important on the day you buy it and the day you sell it . If we 're doing the right things to sell products and grow the earnings over time , the stock price will take care of itself . <p>
