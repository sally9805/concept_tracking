INTO THE ONE MANSINGLE-HANDEDLY LAUNCHED THE UNITED STATES INTO THE AGE OF MODERN FLIGHT - AND HIS LAST NAME WAS N'T WRIGHT . <p> Next year marks the centennial of flight - 100 years since the December day in Kitty Hawk , NC , when the Wright brothers etched themselves so deeply into our collective consciousness . No doubt a good deal of hoopla will be whipped up about those two bicycle builders and their flight that changed America . But what the history books leave out is that the highly secretive Wright brothers refused to publicly demonstrate their airplane for four and a half years after that now legendary 12-second , 37-meter hop . By the time they revealed their machine , a number of other inventors already had airplanes flying . <p> One of them was Glenn Hammond Curtiss , who in the spring of 1910 completed a 243-kilometer public flight along the Hudson River from Albany , NY , to Manhattan . Curtiss 's feat - the first true cross-country flight in the United States - was a technological tour de force . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , but it meant traveling over unpredictable terrain with virtually unknown wind and weather hazards - quite a different matter from the fair-weather demonstration laps around airfields that characterized most of the previous flights . Hundreds of thousands of people showed up to watch Curtiss 's flight , and the New York Times devoted no less than six full pages of text and photos to the occasion - the most space the newspaper had ever allotted a single news event . <p> Glenn Curtiss , largely forgotten today , teaches us an important lesson with implications far beyond aviation history about how technology evolves and how its development is remembered . We 're often obsessed with those , like the Wright brothers , who are first to cross a technological threshold . As important as those progenitors are , though , new technologies often take time to find their niches . Determining their ultimate uses - and their markets - is rarely an easy task . It can take daring to demonstrate a new capability that is well beyond the public 's imagination . It surely takes dedication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost always takes vision . <p> Glenn Curtiss combined all these traits . He arguably did more to make the modern airplane a reality than anyone before or since . While his formal education ended at the eighth grade , Curtiss 's mechanical genius resulted in some 500 groundbreaking innovations , including many features still incorporated in airplanes today - from wing flaps to retractable landing gear . ( By contrast , none of the Wrights ' aeronautical designs have stood the test of time . Most were obsolete by as early as 1912 . ) But Curtiss 's contributions were n't limited to mechanical insights . <p> By 1910 , many flights had already taken place in the United States and in Europe . The year 1909 marked Louis Blriot 's astonishing 39.5-kilometer flight across the English Channel and the world 's first international air meet , where nearly a dozen airplane designs were on display , and the grand prize was offered for a 20-kilometer flight - twice around a huge , specially designed course marked by pylons several stories tall . <p> In the United States , Curtiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experiment Association that included Alexander Graham Bell , and on July 4 , 1908 , he had unveiled his June Bug airplane . It made the premiere public flight in America , winning Scientific American 's coveted prize for the first airplane in the United States to fly a measured kilometer before judges . Later that summer , with all the activity at home and abroad , the Wrights were finally goaded into demonstrating their airplane : Wilbur showed it off to great acclaim in Europe , and Orville demonstrated it to the U.S. military at Fort Myer in Virginia , where it crashed with an army lieutenant on board in the world 's first aviation fatality . But despite a growing number of exhibitions before paying spectators , the airplane , like many emerging technologies , was slow to find its place as much more than an exciting novelty . <p> All that changed with Curtiss 's 1910 flight . More than any other , that event launched the United States into the age of modern flight , much as Louis Paulhan 's similar 1910 flight from London to Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Atlantic cleared the path for the development of airmail and modern air travel , as well as the terrible prospect of air power in war . <p> Near dawn on May 29 , 1910 , in a field on Rensselaer Island on the outskirts of Albany , NY , Curtiss donned his flying outfit in a makeshift tent . When he stepped out , he was in a pair of fisherman 's rubberized waders that came up to his armpits , a cork life jacket , a snug-fitting cap and a pair of goggles . The waders , Curtiss later explained , were not intended so much for the prospect of a water landing as to provide warmth . After all , despite the clear spring day , Curtiss would be flying in the open , several hundred meters in the air , at a speed of roughly 80 kilometers per hour . <p> Even at the early hour , nearly a hundred groggy spectators had assembled at the edge of the field . With virtually no fanfare , Curtiss took the pilot 's seat in the airplane - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and built . A fabric-covered pusher biplane , it had a large wooden propeller that sat behind a dual set of wings . Because Curtiss would make the entire flight over the Hudson River , he had fitted an airtight metal pontoon beneath each wing and , from cloth used for hot-air balloons , had sewn five small air bags and roped them , inflated , onto the undercarriage of the airplane 's frame . The Hudson Flyer was thus the world 's first " amphibian plane . " It could not take off from water ( Curtiss would brilliantly solve that problem the following year ) , but as he and his friend and assistant Henry Kleckler proved in earlier tests , it could handily accomplish a water landing . <p> From his perch on the makeshift runway , Curtiss noted the direction of the smoke from factory stacks to judge wind direction as he readied for takeoff . In Curtiss 's own detailed , minute-by-minute account , published in 1912 , he describes rising smoothly from the Albany field to an altitude of 212 meters and flying straight above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out below him like a wide , glimmering road , he noticed with fascination that he could see through the clear water to deep beneath the river 's surface . Finally airborne on such a beautiful , cloudless day , " I felt an immense sense of relief , " Curtiss writes . " The motor sounded like music . " <p> Curtiss had his sights on one of the most tantalizing aviation challenges of the day . Joseph Pulitzer , the wealthy publisher of the New York World , had offered a $10,000 prize to the first aviator to fly from Albany to Manhattan . According to the rules , the airplane could make two stops along the route , provided the journey occurred within a 24-hour period . There was no thought of a nonstop flight because no airplane of the period could carry enough fuel to cover such a distance . Pulitzer 's contest drew much public attention . The only problem was , most everyone deemed the feat impossible . Nearly a year after Pulitzer 's announcement , not one airplane pilot had stepped forward to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtiss were his personal circumstances . In January 1910 , a U.S. federal court , in a startlingly broad interpretation of a Wright brothers ' patent , had issued a preliminary injunction against Curtiss . As a result , even though the case had yet to be heard , Curtiss was legally prohibited from manufacturing or even exhibiting his aircraft in the United States without a license from the Wrights . And the brothers , who had received backing from a consortium that included Cornelius Vanderbilt and came to be known as the Wall Street Air Trust , were in no mood to discuss licensing arrangements - especially with Curtiss . <p> The Wrights made little secret of the fact that they sought a monopoly on the airplane comparable to the one Alexander Graham Bell had won on the telephone . But the case looks particularly odd in hindsight . The Wrights patented their so-called wing-warping method of bending their airplanes ' delicate wings in flight to achieve lateral stability . It was a conceptual breakthrough , but it was hopelessly impractical . Few pilots other than the Wrights were ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quickly became obsolete . <p> Curtiss never used the Wrights ' method . Instead , he and his team developed ailerons : flaps appended to stronger , rigid wings . As Curtiss argued , the ailerons represented a separate and distinct system for achieving lateral stability - not to mention one that would quickly become the industry standard . <p> With the help of his friend and advisor Judge Monroe Wheeler , Curtiss managed to get the court to allow him to post a $10,000 bond and resume aviation work while he appealed the U.S. court 's injunction . The money , in essence , served as an advance on royalties due to the Wrights in the event that Curtiss lost the case . Curtiss posted the bond , but he was forced several times to pay his employees out of his own deflating pocket . Even worse , given his precarious legal situation , he did n't know where he could turn for a loan , and his company , based in his hometown of Hammondsport , NY , had been officially forced into bankruptcy in April 1910 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Curtiss seized upon the Albany-Manhattan flight - impossible or not - as one of the very few promising options he had . Curtiss 's closest advisors , and his wife Lena ( who had always supported his dangerous forays into aviation before ) , were united in judging the flight to be too risky to attempt . But in signature fashion , Curtiss , undeterred , was a juggernaut of action even as those closest to him remained skeptical . He came to see the flight as a kind of redemptive project - a way to somehow persevere against all odds . <p> In May , word of Curtiss 's intended flight sparked headlines . The New York World launched an immediate publicity campaign for the flight . Not to be outdone , the rival New York Times announced a coup : it would charter a special train on the New York Central 's Hudson River Line to pace the flight , carrying Lena Curtiss and other members of the Curtiss team . Much to the dismay of the staff at the World , the train would also carry New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to keep abreast of the plane every step of the way . <p> They would only lose sight of him twice as he stopped to refuel , a challenge Curtiss planned for in advance by reconnoitering suitable landing sites along the route . Among the places he visited were the large , open grounds of the State Hospital for the Insane perched high on a hill above Pough-keepsie . The superintendent , Dr. Taylor , was his escort . As Curtiss later remembered , the doctor chuckled " when I told him that I intended stopping there on my way down the river in a flying machine . " <p> " Sure you can land here , " Dr. Taylor said . " Most of you flying-machine inventors end up here anyway . " <p> On the first leg of the flight , high above the Hudson River , Curtiss veered to fly alongside the tracking train chartered by the New York Times . He could see his wife Lena waving her handkerchief and later a large American flag out the train window . Henry Kleckler , too , popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cap . Train and airplane , both traveling at roughly 80 kilometers an hour , wove together and apart along the voyage . As Curtiss remembered , " It was like a real race , and I enjoyed the contest more than anything else during the flight . " <p> With little instrumentation , Curtiss had no way to determine his speed other than the strength of the wind against his face . With no altimeter , he could similarly only guess at his altitude . And the deafening drone of the engine behind his head shut out all other sound . Nonetheless , he felt in complete control of the airplane and intensely alert to the tiniest details around him on the crystalline day . Below him , groups of people stared from the riverbanks and waved from boats ; the captain of a river tugboat tooted its horn . Although Curtiss could n't hear it , he saw the blast of white steam rise eerily silent into the air below him . <p> It was clear sailing until his first stop in an open field just past Poughkeepsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted assembled spectators and , despite his careful planning , wound up having to borrow gas and oil from generous motorists to get airborne again . Curtiss was soon back above the Hudson . But trouble lay ahead . <p> Thirty-two kilometers south of Poughkeepsie , the river carves a steep 24-kilometer-long gorge near Storm King Mountain and Breakneck Ridge . The spot funnels treacherous wind currents up from the river . Aware of the danger from his research and reconnaissance , Curtiss tried to climb above it , rising to an altitude of roughly 600 meters . But it was not high enough . Just past Storm King Mountain , as Lena watched frantic and helpless from the train , a crosscurrent tilted the plane sideways , and it dropped more than 30 meters within seconds . Momentarily losing control , Curtiss was nearly thrown from the airplane . " It was the worst plunge I ever got in an aeroplane , " Curtiss said later . " My heart was in my mouth . I thought it was all over . " <p> As the wind steadied , Curtiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could just make out the northern tip of Manhattan and the outline of the 50-story-high Metropolitan Life Tower - the world 's tallest building - above the line of the horizon . He was beginning to feel elated with the knowledge that he was so near the end of the trip when he noticed that his oil gauge read near empty . The design of the plane required Curtiss to lubricate the engine through a manual control roughly every ten minutes to assure its smooth running ; his first thought was that he must have inadvertently " been too enthusiastic " with the oil lever over Breakneck Ridge . In fact , although he would n't discover it until later , the airplane had been seriously leaking oil for some time . With the prospect that his engine could freeze up at any time , Curtiss knew he must land immediately to replenish his oil . <p> Nervously winging east at the northernmost tip of Manhattan , where the Harlem River curves around at the Harlem Gorge to meet the Hudson , Curtiss looked for a little meadow - one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites . There was no time to lose . Spotting nothing more suitable , he set down on a sloping lawn that rose 30 meters above the Hudson . Safely on the ground , he breathed a sigh of relief and realized that he was inside the city limits . In just over two and a half hours of flying time , he had covered 243 kilometers , averaging nearly 88 kilometers per hour . <p> Curtiss soon learned that he had landed on the grounds of the estate of the late financier and leather merchant William B. Isham . The current residents , Isham 's daughter and her husband , jumped up from reading the Sunday newspaper and ran outside when they heard the roar of the approaching motor . They had just been reading about the proposed flight and were stunned to see Curtiss 's airplane bouncing up their sloping front lawn . <p> At the Isham estate , Curtiss telephoned the New York World with the news that he had landed within the city limits . Having technically fulfilled the contest 's requirements , another aviator might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that he would continue to his planned landing on Governors Island at the other end of Manhattan as soon as he refilled his oil pan . He said later that he thought of all the spectators in the city counting on his arrival . Later , one magazine writer noted that Curtiss 's decision to fly on over Manhattan was " a magnificent sportsmanlike thing that won him the unbounded admiration of all New York . " <p> After a dangerous and tricky takeoff down the sloping cliff over the river , Curtiss once again rose above the Hudson , this time with the shimmering Manhattan skyline beckoning him onward through the clear midday sky . As he approached the city , he was overwhelmed by the spectacle he saw below him . Crowds were everywhere : on rooftops , in trees and packed many deep along the riverbanks . Passengers on ferry boats and ocean liners craned over railings and waved wildly in the air to him . And people directly beneath him on scores of crafts large and small dotting the Hudson cheered him on . In no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmark of the finish line - stood close before him . Turning westward , he remembered , he triumphantly " circled the lady with the torch " and headed as planned for the parade grounds at nearby Governors Island . <p> It was just past noon when , after a perfect landing , Curtiss emerged from his airplane to cheers from scores of enthusiastic U.S. Army personnel stationed at the island 's small base . Much acclaim followed Curtiss 's heroic flight , including awards , dinners and press conferences . The New York press crowned Curtiss " King of the Air . " At a black-tie dinner at the Astor Hotel in his honor , Curtiss formally presented to New York mayor William Gaynor a letter given to him by James B. McEwan , the mayor of Albany . It was the first airmail letter delivered in the United States . <p> Although he was unable to attend the gala event , President William H. Taft sent a congratulatory telegram to Curtiss . " It seems that the wonders of aviation will never cease , " Taft wrote , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories as having been the greatest . " <p> Taft did n't know the half of it . Curtiss 's flight from Albany to New York City broke a formidable psychological barrier for aviation in America . That Sunday , and not just for the hundreds of thousands of witnesses but for many others who read or heard of Curtiss 's accomplishment , the airplane all at once presented itself as a useful and practical technology . <p> The prevailing mythology about the airplane portrays the Wright brothers as earnest young bicycle builders - which they were , early in their careers . But once competition like Curtiss 's comes into the picture , the Wrights look more like greedy spoilers . And the astounding leap into the air they took at Kitty Hawk begins to seem less like an isolated breakthrough and more like an important step in a very long progression of brilliant accomplishments in aviation . <p> The period of the airplane 's earliest development , the first decades of the 1900s , was one of dynamism - a time much like today , dominated by fast-paced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having made a tremendous breakthrough in aviation , Wilbur and Orville Wright tried to control the development of the airplane in its first decade through patents and aggressive business tactics . Curtiss 's legal battle with the Wrights would continue for nine long years - years that were absolutely crucial to the airplane 's development . Ultimately , the Wrights would fail in their effort to secure a monopoly , thanks to Curtiss 's persistence and , with the advent of World War I , a decision by the U.S. government that forced the Wright Company to cross-license its technology to produce more airplanes for the war . <p> For his part , Glenn Curtiss did receive a number of patents over his lifetime . But he always permitted further use of the principles underlying his inventions - a strategy that enormously benefited the emerging industry . Unlike the Wrights , Curtiss believed his inventions and products had to succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merit . The goal , he said , ought to be simply to keep building better airplanes than anyone else . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career to be judged , and it is how it should be judged : by the lasting , unrivaled success of his aeronautical inventions . Other Curtiss Firsts <p> Well before - and after - Glenn Curtiss made his milestone flight from Albany to New York , he was celebrated for a series of breakthroughs . 1903 American motorcycle champion . Curtiss won the first championship tournament of the National Cycle Association , in Yonkers , NY , by riding 1.6 kilometers in 56.4 seconds . 1905 " Fastest man alive . " Curtiss set an unofficial world speed record of 219.4 kilometers per hour at Ormond Beach , FL , with the first V-8 engine motorcycle , which he designed . 1908 First U.S. public flight . Curtiss made the first official public flight in the United States on July 4 , 1908 , in Hammondsport , NY , flying 1,542 meters in the June Bug . 1909 International air speed record .
