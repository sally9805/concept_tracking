Section : WAR ON TERROR <p> Osama bin Laden , wherever he is , has lost his Afghan base . Many of his top lieutenants are dead . The question is whether his global terror network can operate without a state . A NEWSWEEK Special Report on the future of Al Qaeda . <p> As his adopted country fell to the enemy , Osama bin Laden remained a kind of phantom , more myth than man . Some Afghan fighters last week claimed they had seen him on horseback , riding along the front lines near the Tora Bora cave complex , against a backdrop of snowcapped mountains . Other reports placed him 20 miles to the west , hiding out in a mountain area called Sikaram , or even across the border in the tribal areas of Pakistan . Locals at the village of Wazir , near Tora Bora , insist that bin Laden arrived there in a car with one of his sons , a teenager , around Oct. 1 . A convoy of vehicles passed through the village , and as many as 1,000 Qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed into the mountains together . " They took all of the ammunition , artillery and weapons they could find in the village , " says Abdullah Kamran , a local tribal leader , " and then went into the caves . " <p> Wherever he was hiding , bin Laden must have been contemplating his own doom . His Afghan benefactor , Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar , relinquished control of the extremists ' stronghold at Kandahar last week , even as U.S. forces continued to relentlessly bomb the mountain hideouts of Qaeda and Taliban forces . According to British intelligence , the bombs may have hit bin Laden 's closest lieutenant , Egyptian doctor Ayman Al-Zawahiri , whom many consider the brains behind Al Qaeda . ( The reports , based on communications intercepts , could not be confirmed by U.S. intelligence ; family members in Cairo published a newspaper notice saying that Al-Zawahiri 's wife and children had been killed . ) An American guided bomb had already taken out bin Laden 's top military commander , Muhammad Atef , four weeks earlier . <p> Now some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against attacks by anti-Taliban Pashtun fighters , were desperate . Using megaphones , they shouted in Arabic down the ravines : " We 're Muslims and you 're Muslims . Muslims should n't fight each other ! " But it was a little late for appeals to Muslim brotherhood from militants who had been trying to exterminate their Afghan enemies for years . <p> Bin Laden and Mullah Omar must be wondering what has become of their grand designs to remake the world . Both men believed that Afghanistan would be the first building block in an Islamic-militant empire that would stretch , eventually , across the planet . Omar , a half-educated , one-eyed warrior with almost no knowledge of the wider world , regarded himself as the commander of the Muslim faithful , a title that no leader had claimed in centuries . And the savvy bin Laden had stoked Omar 's megalomania , in large part because he needed Afghanistan as a base to achieve his own ambitions : to wage an epochal war against the infidel West . Bin Laden called his organization Al Qaeda  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation for a much wider and diffuse movement . But the real " base " was Afghanistan , a country honeycombed with Qaeda safehouses , training camps and mysterious research facilities . And now , for all practical purposes , Afghanistan has fallen to bin Laden 's foes . <p> A wealth of new information from inside Afghanistan reveals the extent to which bin Laden 's foreign forces had " colonized " the country  --  and the magnitude of what it meant to Al Qaeda 's operations . Yet the campaign to hit Al Qaeda outside of Afghanistan has not been nearly as successful as the military campaign to destroy the leadership . A complex network of Qaeda operatives remains at large , including U.S.-based cells . One of those cells , NEWSWEEK has learned , nearly launched an attack on a major target in Washington , D.C. , after September 11 . <p> Intelligence sources told NEWSWEEK that a Qaeda " sleeper cell " in the United States was poised to launch the attack  --  perhaps against the Capitol Building  --  not long after the 9-11 atrocities . The sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violators and other suspects of Mideast backgrounds , picked up members of a " support cell " tasked with providing logistics help to the people actually carrying out the mission . The would-be terrorists then went underground or fled the country , intelligence sources say . Yet it is not clear whether investigators have been able to identify the plotters from among the hundreds of people caught in the FBI dragnet . <p> Finding the terrorists who are still operating at home and abroad may be the No. 1 problem now , even as bin Laden 's world falls down around him in Afghanistan . The war has produced a hodgepodge of disturbing intelligence that investigators are still trying to sift and analyze . Perhaps the most alarming evidence gathered so far concerns Al Qaeda efforts to develop biological weapons . According to intelligence sources , U.S. operatives in Afghanistan have collected information that one or more Russian scientists were working inside Afghanistan with Qaeda operatives . One well-placed source told NEWSWEEK that evidence from the scene indicates that the renegade Russians were helping Al Qaeda to develop anthrax , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockpiled by the terrorist group . While the source believes any such stockpiles were destroyed in U.S. bombing raids , it is not known how much , if any , of the anthrax ever made it out of Afghanistan . <p> The infamous Dr. Al-Zawahiri may have been directly involved in the biological program . A senior American intelligence official told NEWSWEEK that Al-Zawahiri 's house in Kabul resembled the lair of a mad scientist . Northern Alliance soldiers who raided the house on Nov. 13 found grenades , blasting caps , electronic components and " various solid and liquid substances . " These included white crystals and extremely fine , silvery powders in jars and plastic bags , and mysterious liquids in shampoo bottles labeled special medicine . American intelligence later collected samples from Northern Alliance colleagues and conducted chemical and biological tests . One of the samples turned up a " positive indicator " for Bacillus anthracis , or anthrax . All of the samples are being retested , the source told NEWSWEEK . <p> The Kabul house of a Pakistani nuclear scientist , Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood , contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive Internet search on anthrax vaccines , and a report titled " Bacteria : What You Need to Know . " According to intelligence sources , investigators also found a report titled " Iraqi Anthrax Troops , " and a New York Times article on Plum Island , the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's animal-disease center near the north fork of Long Island . The Plum Island center does research to help guard the United States " against catastrophic economic losses caused by foreign animal disease agents accidentally or deliberately introduced into the U.S. , " its Web site explains . <p> The intelligence revelations raise troubling questions . Following the fall of Kandahar , and the formation of a U.N.-backed interim administration to rule Afghanistan starting Dec. 22 , one question remains paramount : can the global Qaeda network thrive without Afghanistan as a base , and without its key leadership ? On the good-news front , Al Qaeda 's training-and-logistics organization in Afghanistan appears to have been more central to the group 's development and cohesion than many analysts had thought . Most evidence suggests that major attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African embassies in 1998 and the destroyer USS Cole in 2000  --  were largely coordinated and organized from inside Afghanistan . On the other hand , intelligence gathered to date suggests that the worst attack of them all , on September 11 , was substantially planned in or supported from places outside of Afghanistan . It appears to have had its origins in the cell in Hamburg , where lead hijacker Mohamed Atta lived for eight years . And it seems to have been developed in contacts with other European cells , and received funding through Dubai . <p> Questions about the nature of the organization itself remain unanswered , too . Al Qaeda is widely likened to a cult , and some believe that it will wither and die once its charismatic leaders are gone . Others argue that it could mutate , like a disease , into something potentially more furtive  --  covert cells that have no public " face " or base to strike back at . Still , if Al Qaeda lives on in that form , such disaffiliated cells may be less capable of launching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they 'll be operating in a much more vigilant environment . Since September 11 , antiterror laws have been strengthened in some countries , financial networks have been hindered and intelligence cooperation has intensified . <p> What investigators do know today , three months after the attacks on New York and Washington , is this : it took the fertile soil of fundamentalist Afghanistan to grow Al Qaeda from a relatively small outfit to a thriving global organization . Analysts now realize there was almost no difference between Al Qaeda and " foreign " Taliban forces ; the terrorism impresario had all but hijacked the country and its hapless leader Mullah Omar , and had free run of it . Investigators know that Al Qaeda had roughly 40 training camps throughout Afghanistan . German federal police investigating Al Qaeda 's Hamburg cell , whose members included three of the September 11 hijackers , believe that as many as 70,000 Muslims from dozens of countries passed through the camps over a period of several years . ( That figure far surpasses estimates by the CIA , which puts the number at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other foreign graduates of the camps fought in front-line Taliban units . Others attended more specialized camps that focused on bomb-making , sabotage and use of chemical weapons . <p> The Afghan base provided Al Qaeda with many of the advantages of a state infrastructure . Officials at the Ministry of the Interior 's " public-identity office , " for instance , say they issued about 15,000 Afghan identity cards to foreign militants during the past three years . Al Qaeda offices in Kabul have yielded stacks of Afghan passports , as well as forged documents from Pakistan and many other countries . <p> Bin Laden plied his Taliban hosts with money , gifts and other favors . " He was always handing out $50,000 to this commander , or $10,000 to that commander , " says Mullah Alhaj Khaksar , a senior Taliban defector . " And cars  --  Afghans love cars . He would get 20 or 30 cars and bring them in from Kandahar as a present just before an offensive . " Western intelligence agencies estimate that bin Laden funneled as much as $100 million a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That staggering amount does n't surprise the chief pilot of Ariana Afghan Airlines , Said Nabi Hashimi . By 1998 Ariana could no longer fly to most destinations in the world . But before U.N . sanctions were imposed in late 2000 , the Taliban and Al Qaeda kept the airline 's planes busy shuttling to Sharjah and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates . Mysterious passengers often boarded the planes in Kabul using Ariana crew IDs . " They would be people we had never seen in our lives , " says Hashimi . And when the pilot asked his Taliban-appointed bosses about the strange " employees , " he was told they were friends of ministers or other VIPs . In Dubai , the men were able to disembark without passing through standard customs or immigration controls . <p> More mysterious was the appearance in mid-1998 of an airstrip deep in the Rigestan Desert , about 150 miles southwest of Kandahar . At night " it looked like a small city down there , " Hashimi said . " There were so many lights . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any size in there , day or night . " When the controllers at Kandahar asked an incoming flight 's destination , the aircrafts ' pilots would respond " the Strip , " in English , and nothing more . " We could tell they were big planes ... because they were coming in from 28,000 or 31,000 feet , and only a big , pressurized plane flies that high . At one point there were as many as six or seven big planes coming in every day , night and day . " It seems clear now that the Taliban and Al Qaeda were running a large logistical operation , moving men , weapons and other supplies . <p> Al Qaeda will no longer be able to use Afghanistan as a kind of organized breeding ground for militants . But Afghans never really became part of bin Laden 's international organization anyway , and tens of thousands of foreign extremists have already learned military and terror skills and moved on . Hundreds if not thousands of hard-core militants are still at large , including many who were involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own money , even if Al Qaeda 's funds are blocked , and they have knowledge that can be passed on to other extremists . <p> Some key fugitives appear to have had a hand in both the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen and the September 11 attacks . Investigators are particularly interested in a meeting that took place in Malaysia on Jan. 5 , 2000 . The list of attendees included Tawfiq bin Atash ( a.k.a . Khallad ) and Fahad al-Quso , both of whom helped plan the Cole attack . Also present were Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi , two of the September 11 hijackers , and Ramzi Binalshibh ( a.k.a . Ramzi Omar ) , who may have been the phantom " 20th hijacker " who could n't get into the United States prior to September 11 because of visa problems . NEWSWEEK has learned that when Almihdhar and Alhazmi left Malaysia , they flew directly to Los Angeles , where they quickly enrolled in a San Diego flight school . That leads investigators to believe that at least some of the planning for September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hijackers are now dead , of course . But what about their colleagues and presumed handlers ? The United States has no idea of the whereabouts of bin Atash , who once commanded bin Laden 's bodyguards and who served as operational chief of the Cole bombing . Binalshibh traveled to Spain in the summer of 2001 , at the same time hijacker Mohamed Atta was there . And on Sept. 5 , the FBI believes , he flew to the United Arab Emirates , the financial hub of the September 11 operation . He disappeared on the 10th and has n't been seen since . <p> Western governments have arrested perhaps a couple dozen of known Qaeda suspects since September 11 . The post-September 11 dragnet by American law-en-forcement agencies has caught roughly 100 people who were subsequently charged with crimes by federal prosecutors ; another 550 or so are being held for violating immigration laws . None of those charged has been directly accused of involvement in the September 11 attacks , however . Only a few have been accused of abetting the 9-11 terrorists ( by providing fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts with the hijackers . <p> In the most optimistic reading of the current situation , America has delivered such a blow to Al Qaeda that even hard-core elements will realize the struggle is over now . But that almost certainly underestimates the zealotry of bin Laden 's followers , or their capacity for martyrdom . <p> Few militants could have been in worse straits last week than an Egyptian fighter named Abu Talha Rashid , who lay wan and wounded in the filthy , soot-coated backroom of an Afghan villager 's hut near Tora Bora . Educated at the prestigious American University in Beirut , Rashid and his brother came to Afghanistan in 1998 . But now Rashid did n't know whether his brother  --  last seen in Konduz  --  was dead or alive . And Rashid 's right leg was severely fractured ( from a tumble down a steep mountainside ) , badly swollen and intensely painful . <p> Yet despite his dire condition  --  or perhaps because of it  --  Rashid still burned with anti-American hatred . " Maybe the Taliban loses all of Afghanistan , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The history of Islam will never forget how Mullah Omar sacrificed his government for Islam . " Rashid could n't move his toes , but still expected that God would give him health  --  or usher him to the afterlife . " When I hear the sound of American aircraft , " he told a NEWSWEEK reporter , " I pray for death at American hands . " That 's one Qaeda prayer , at least , that may be answered to Washington 's satisfaction . NEWSWEEK Poll <p> FOR THIS NEWSWEEK POLL , PRINCETON SURVEY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES INTERVIEWED 1,003 ADULTS BY TELEPHONE DEC. 6-7 . THE MARGIN OF ERROR IS +/-3 PERCENTAGE POINTS . THE NEWSWEEK POLL c2001 BY NEWSWEEK , INC . <p> In the NEWSWEEK Poll , 29% say capturing or killing bin Laden will make him a martyr , down from 48% who said so in October 63% say Yasir Arafat can not control extremist Palestinian groups like the ones responsible for the recent violence 63% say Arafat is an obstacle to peace , and 18% say he 's committed to it ; asked the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan <p> Osama bin Laden called his network Al Qaeda  --  the Base  --  because he saw it as a headquarters operation for a much wider terror movement . But will the organization be able to thrive without Afghanistan as its haven , and if bin Laden and other key leaders are eradicated ? A primer : <p> LEADERSHIP <p> BEFORE : Bin Laden and his trusted lieutenants , safely entrenched in Afghanistan , controlled the various pieces of Al Qaeda and coordinated cells around the world . <p> NOW : Who 's running the show ? With bin Laden in hiding and some of his top lieutenants wounded or killed , it 's doubtful the leaders who remain are providing much direction . <p> TERROR CELLS <p> Usually composed of four or five members , Qaeda cells plan , support and carry out terror attacks . Without a global support network , however , their effectiveness probably will be diminished . <p> MONEY <p> BEFORE : Qaeda funding was controlled by a central finance committee and funneled illegally through banks and charities . <p> NOW : International crackdown on terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell activities . <p> COMMUNICATION <p> BEFORE : Cells communicated with each other and Qaeda leaders via satellite phones , cell phones and e-mail . <p> NOW : New antiterrorism laws in the United States , Britain and elsewhere make it easier to arrest those heard of by intelligence officials as engaging in suspicious communication . <p> RECRUITS <p> BEFORE : Bin Laden operatives were recruited from mosques around the world and brought to Afghanistan for training . They were then sent to various countries to help existing cells or to start new operations . <p> NOW : With no place to train , strong recruitment drives are less likely , cells will suffer without the infusion of fresh recruits . <p> OTHER CELLS <p> BEFORE : Cells operated independent of one another and needed a facilitator on the scene to coordinate an attack . <p> NOW : With leadership and communication abilities hampered , it may be more difficult for cells to coordinate and carry out major attacks . <p> SOURCE : NEWSWEEK REPORTING .
