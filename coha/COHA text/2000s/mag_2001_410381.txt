HOW A BAND OF ACTIVISTS BLOCKED BIG OIL 'S DRILLING PLANS OFF NORTH CAROLINA 'S OUTER BANKS <p> On an afternoon in late spring the breakers that roll ashore on Cape Hatteras are a milky jade , a color that reminds me how far south we are , and how close to the Gulf Stream . Just off the beach young gannets hunt , folding their slender wings as they dive smoothly into the sea . Behind them , green water stretches to the horizon . <p> I am looking out at 4,000 miles of wilderness . There is nothing made by humans between the beach where I stand and Africa . <p> It might have been very different : Twenty years ago the federal government and American oil companies envisioned a floating industrial city out there . There would have been drill ships and wellheads and pipelines bringing natural gas and oil to a processing facility , perhaps on the coast at Morehead City . Now  --  so far  --  there is nothing out there but clean open water . <p> You often hear that our communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustices , that people are too busy , too shortsighted , too selfish . You hear that democracy does n't work anymore because politicians listen only to the lobbyists instead of the voters . I do n't think that 's always true . When enough people participate and protest , over and over , it is possible to effect change . If you want to see the proof , come to the Outer Banks and sail east . <p> The battle against offshore drilling in North Carolina-the first round , at least  --  lasted a dozen years . It was declared over last November when the latest of a series of oil companies abandoned their efforts to drill in a leased area off the Outer Banks . At first , the activists who 'd fought drilling believed we might never again have to worry about wells being sunk off our shores . We talked about disbanding . Now , we can scarcely believe how drastically the political climate has changed since that heady moment . With George W. Bush in the White House and Vice President Cheney pushing an energy plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've entered a new stage of watchfulness . And we have realized that this fight  --  like many such struggles  --  may never be over . <p> Plans to drill off the Outer Banks first surfaced in 1981 , when the federal government sold the mineral rights to a block of leases 40 miles off Cape Hatteras , site of a national seashore . At the time , the Outer Banks were still sparsely populated , and the lease sale did not attract much attention . Federal officials completed an initial environmental impact statement , which included little about the biology or physical dynamics of the lease blocks . <p> Sinking oil and gas wells offshore is a risky venture because of the danger of blowouts and pipeline ruptures , as well as the daily increments of pollution . Off Hatteras , conditions were what might be called " challenging . " The north-flowing Gulf Stream collides with a tendril of the southbound Labrador Current there , creating knots and plumes of flow that change daily , even hourly . More than 2,000 feet below the surface , the ocean bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also beset by hurricanes . No one had ever drilled in an area with such a combination of forces . <p> None of my neighbors or friends knew any of this in November 1988 , when we learned that a consortium of oil companies led by Mobil had applied for permits to sink an exploratory well about 40 miles off Hatteras . The companies hoped to find up to 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Atlantic , in an area known as the Point . The deep waters there are home to rare sea turtles and birds , whales and dolphins , tuna , marlin , and sailfish . Flying fish skip over the waves like emerald darts . Floating mats of saffron-colored algae , holding tiny crabs and shrimp , drift west from the Sargasso Sea . <p> What could be done to stop Mobil and its partners ? No one seemed to know . When a loosely organized group of Outer Banks residents asked state officials what recourse we had , we were told we should have raised our concerns in 1981 during the lease sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branch of the Department of the Interior that oversees drilling for fossil fuels , tends to favor oil interests , especially during conservative administrations . With the first George Bush in the White House , we did n't trust the agency to protect our islands and waters from pollution and oil spills . <p> What could we do ? The question united the dozen people who became the core of a new grassroots group . Most of us were in our 30s , from a range of occupations : a dental hygienist , a local publisher , an artist , a nurse , a singer , a college math professor who had dropped out of academia . We had passion , but little idea how to use it . Staff members from Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council urged us to get our congressman , the late Walter Jones Sr. , to take a stand against drilling off North Carolina . Jones chaired the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee and wielded enough power to delay drilling , and possibly stop it altogether . But when three local men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception . " We were all smiling and thanking Jones for his support for the county , " remembers Michael McOwen , " and I asked him a question about offshore drilling that put him on the spot . The smiles tided very quickly , and the meeting was over . He did n't know any of the details of what Mobil wanted to do , and I had embarrassed him . " <p> Without Jones ' support , our best hope was to convince state officials to deny the permits Mobil needed for drilling . Although the drill site lay well beyond the boundaries of state waters , the federal Coastal Zone Management Act allows states to determine whether exploration plans submitted by oil companies are consistent with state environmental policies . Governor James Martin , a Republican , refused to take a stand on the issue-though we suspected he would be more comfortable talking with oil executives than with members of a new environmental group . We named ourselves LegaSea and incorporated as a nonprofit organization . Linda Mizelle , a petite , soft-spoken woman , agreed to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael McOwen , a local businessman , was to be the press contact . I volunteered to help write a newsletter and compile scientific information about drilling and pollution , jobs that would keep me behind the scenes . While I badly wanted to keep the oil companies out of the water , I valued my privacy , and I could see that this issue might consume my entire life . <p> I also had some qualms about the course being charted by the others . Because North Carolina is such a conservative state , Linda and Michael believed LegaSea needed to portray itself as a watchdog organization . She wanted us to avoid being linked with activist groups like Greenpeace  --  even though staff members at Greenpeace and the NRDC were feeding us vital information and tactical advice . Michael told local newspapers that LegaSea was n't necessarily opposed to drilling , but members wanted to make sure it could be done safely . That was at best a stretch ; we knew there was no way Mobil and its partners could satisfy us that drilling would be harmless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat , sandy , lifeless bottom purportedly taken at the drill site . But later , scientists using deepwater submersibles explored the craggy bottom and counted up to 120,000 organisms in each cubic meter of water , one of the highest concentrations of sea life ever measured off the Atlantic coast . <p> Our feigned neutrality did not last : In March 1989 , the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound  --  and the Outer Banks communities became solidly opposed to offshore drilling . <p> Photographs from Alaska of dying seabirds and oil-slicked beaches made me sick . When a reporter called from a paper in Greensboro , I made a statement for LegaSea : " This accident shows exactly why people do n't trust companies like Mobil to live up to their promises . " My reluctance to be in the public eye had been overcome by my horror at the Valdez wreckage , and my fear that Mobil would succeed . <p> We soon learned how to wage grassroots political war . We sold bumper stickers and T-shirts , collected thousands of signatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We convinced the local chamber of commerce , board of Realtors , and town and county governments to pass resolutions against drilling . Eight of us also made lobbying trips to Capitol Hill in Washington . Our efforts helped win political allies : Walter Jones and , eventually , Governor Martin . They convinced Congress to include North Carolina in several yearlong moratoria on new offshore drilling . <p> When I think about our 12-year fight , what I remember most are my private fits of obsession . There was always something that had to be done  --  write a newsletter , make a presentation , get to a meeting . I was supposed to be writing a book about wild animals , but I had lost my focus . I was too angry about having to fight Mobil . <p> People rally to causes for different reasons . The North Carolina coast has long faced environmental threats , including hog farming , wetland destruction , and phosphate mining . Offshore oil struck me as a more hideous evil , because it would have extended industrialization into virgin waters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some simple conservation measures could save as much energy as might lie off the entire East Coast  --  an observation that resonates in today 's debates over energy policy . LegaSea members shared a deep sense of outrage . We knew the oil companies hoped to wear us down , and we were determined not to let that happen . <p> Had we not learned to pace ourselves over the years , we might have grown too exhausted to continue fighting . Or we might have let down our guard long enough for Mobil to execute a move too clever for us and our allies to block . But whenever one of us began to feel burned out , the group would give that person a sabbatical . A tugboat captain named Michael Egan took over the newsletter from me , and so saved my book contract . <p> Mickey Baker , an outspoken shopkeeper on remote Ocracoke Island , showed a passion and energy that inspired us all . Once , she set up a special telephone line so her customers and tourists could call their congressmen . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public hearing to show how much pollution it could cause . On one of her petitions , she collected 17,000 signatures . I stood with Mickey in terms of my political views . But I also came to admire Linda 's persistent , just-the-facts-ma'am style . Her reasonable demeanor and unfailing courtesy helped portray us as middle Americans fighting a great injustice . Her quiet determination opened doors for us in households where offshore oil might never have gotten a second thought . <p> In 1990 , prior to his reelection bid , then-President George Bush placed a 10-year moratorium on new oil and gas drilling off most of the U.S. coast , except North Carolina . The state 's exemption angered Governor Martin , and from then on he professed to be in LegaSea 's camp . In 1994 , the Commerce Department refused to approve Mobil 's exploration plan or issue them a permit to discharge well waste . Mobil announced that it would sue the federal government to recoup the cost of the leases . We were ecstatic ; if Mobil 's leases were repurchased , our battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobil 's suit worked its way slowly through the courts . Then in 1997 , Chevron announced its intention to drill in a separate lease block it had purchased in 1981 , and our fight began anew  --  though in a changed political climate . Clinton was president and North Carolina had a Democratic governor , Jim Hunt . Our membership had grown to 300 . We sent letters asking people to contact their elected officials , again . One morning in 1998 , I ran into a retired oil-rig diver from Louisiana who had been one of our earliest supporters . " I 've never understood why you guys have n't hit harder on the social problems drilling 's going to cause , " he said . " I 've seen coastal communities in Louisiana ruined when Big Oil comes to town . " " We 've already got that covered , " I said . " Dare County 's on record as opposing locating oil and gas refineries here . " The diver snorted . " Where do you think they 're going to base the guys who work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's here . And I guarantee you that oil workers will bring trouble-gambling , drugs , prostitution , you name it . " <p> He was right . We did n't want the ocean industrialized , but no one wanted their towns to become havens for crime . I spent much of the next month writing letters to newspapers and talking with members of local churches , including women in a politically active Baptist congregation . I urged them to call Senator Jesse Helms and say they did n't want the oil industry in Dare County . I 'd like to think my effort to link arms with the conservative Christians was effective . There 's really no way to know . But that fall , when Chevron was supposed to file its applications for drilling permits with the state , none appeared . <p> In June 2000 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Interior Department should refund Mobil Oil and its partners $158 million for its lease blocks off Hatteras Island . LegaSea 's members hardly had time to celebrate before state officials called to tell us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state was expecting to receive a drilling application from Conoco . Then in November we received some startling news : Conoco had decided to abandon the lease blocks . Carlton Adams , a Conoco spokesman , said the company had concluded that it was wasting money paying rent on them . " If you have leases that are absolutely valueless because you ca n't use them , " he said , " why should you hang on to them ? " <p> Today , there are no more active lease blocks off the Outer Banks . Even now , writing that brings tears to my eyes . <p> It is rare for a group of oil companies to be fought to a standstill . Part of LegaSea 's success must be attributed to luck , especially in the timing of the Exxon Valdez accident . But I also believe that we won this time  --  that democracy won  --  because we took pains to involve the whole Outer Banks community : Our alliance reached across political , religious , social , and cultural lines . We stood together and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not let down our guard . After Conoco 's announcement , LegaSea 's leaders talked of holding a grand celebration with the money left in the organization 's bank account . But we decided it would be wiser to keep the money . Just in case . <p> At present , North Carolina is included in a moratorium against new offshore drilling until 2012 . Last spring , however , a committee that advises the Interior Department on oil and gas drilling recommended that federal officials explore lifting the moratorium from five areas , including the waters off the Outer Banks . Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham later promised in a Senate hearing that the ban will be left in place , at least here . <p> What if it is not ? We are reassured by the fact that scientists in North Carolina have completed many studies to show why new drilling leases should not be sold off the Outer Banks . The currents are too strong , the weather too violent , and the waters too thick with life . Still , LegaSea 's leaders are too wary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current political situation is too tenuous . And while the Bush administration 's energy plan has met with strong political resistance , LegaSea 's members fear that the oil companies might yet find another way to drill off the North Carolina coast . This is not paranoia on our part : In June we got word of proposed revisions to the national Coastal Zone Management Act , which is up for reauthorization by Congress this year . One revision would eliminate the right of states to review projects that lie outside their territorial waters-that is , more than three miles offshore . <p> So the thrusts and parries continue . I do not expect them to stop . As often as I can , I visit the Hatteras Island beaches and face east to whitecaps and scudding clouds . It 's hard to place a monetary value on the wilderness I see . But I think it 's fair to say that LegaSea 's members have ransomed it with our time , our sweat , our hearts . In summer , dolphins frolic just past the breakers , and shorebirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring storms , yes , but also lines of scoters and an occasional spouting whale . Our waters are still clear and full of life , our air and sands unsullied . For now . <p> By Jan DeBlieu <p>
