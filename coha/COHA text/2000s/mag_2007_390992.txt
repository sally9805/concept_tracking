Outerwear needs to be practical , of course , but that does n't mean it ca n't be spectacular , and this season , we 're positively spoiled for choice This fall , there is no excuse not to make a grand entrance  --  and exit . Shrug on a sumptuous fur-trimmed coat by Versace or Dior 's emerald ostrich number and rest assured you 'll leave spectators swooning in your wake . The new batch of coats has elevated the cold-weather essential from beyond basics to major fashion-statement material . Photograph : Prints : Herms SEAN CUNNINGHAM " The coat you buy for the season should be absolutely drop-dead gorgeous , " says Chicago boutique owner Ikram Goldman . Coats have become a key element in the style-conscious woman 's wardrobe , and we 've come a long way from having just one all-purpose black or camel cashmere piece . You can never go wrong with a classic , but why not amp up your glamour quotient with a sampling of the diverse shapes , shades , and sheens from the fall collections ? From a sexy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles at Derek Lam , designers certainly seem to have mined their creative depths designing outerwear , and we should certainly revel in wearing it . Photograph : Mixed Textures : Proenza Schouler Some of the biggest news to come out of the runway shows was the fresh , forward silhouettes . Overall are no exception . Drop-waist and oversize poufed pieces have been replaced by hourglass-enhancing styles and sleek cuts . The more overtly feminine looks are brought up to date with luxe belts , like the dramatic metal corset Dolce &; Gabbana paired with a shiny wrap coat or the more refined , simple waist cinchers seen at Proenza Schouler . Volume has been reworked into a more sophisticated , restrained air , like sloped shoulders that give way to a fuller yet more tailored body . The style has a retro but thoroughly modern feel . Calvin Klein , Michael Kors , and Yves Saint Laurent all perfectly presented how polished it can look . " Whenever we wear a little volume on top , it should be beautifully balanced with something narrow in contrast to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it 's a slim pant or great black leggings , it 's nice to see the slender shape of your leg protruding from beneath the volume . " Photograph : Double Breasted : Derek Lam And let 's not forget the whimsical appeal of girlish capes , which Stella McCartney and Zac Posen endorsed for fall . " Capes are a great fashion piece that keep coming back again and again because they are so accessible , " says Sarah Easley , co-owner of New York fashion emporium Kirna Zabte . " They appeal to a wide range of women because of the sizeless , ageless component . There is a very European feel to the look of a cape : a little bit Parisian or English country , " she adds . And who would n't want that bit of continental flair ? Photograph : Fur Trim : Versace Texture , too , is a factor this season when you 're looking for a coat with character . Miuccia Prada led the way with a shag-carpet-like wool-mohair material . ( It looks so soft and cozy , a PETA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a favorite for giving outerwear added oomph , whether they were trimming the hem or snaking down the back . Fabrics like satin and velvet , which were once considered evening only , have turned up on everyday toppers , at Lanvin and Marc by Marc Jacobs , respectively . Bold prints had their moment at Herms , Balenciaga , and Etro . Fur , too , appeared in innovative ways ( see Versace , J. Mendel , and Carolina Herrera ) . " Fur was used in dramatic applications , " says Fargo , " like trimmed extra wide on the hem , almost from the hip down . I 'm loving it . " Photograph : Michael Kors DAN &; CORINA LECCA And if that were n't enough , there 's also the promise of fabulous color . Bright , vibrant , and unique eye-catching coats were scattered throughout the collections , proving wearable outerwear is no longer restricted to black , gray , navy , and camel ( though they definitely , as always , had a huge presence ) . " Color is more interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that tomato-red , long , lean belted coat from Marc Jacobs . " More shades of scarlet were seen at Gucci , Anne Klein , Valentino , and Luella . Giambattista Valli and Bottega Veneta had ones in bright yellow , while Marni , Jil Sander , Donna Karan , Richard Chai , and Thakoon chose deep purple or cobalt blue . Photograph : Jean Paul Gaultier But let 's get down to it : Our toppers need to be workhorses . " I love coats . They are like the home-away-from-home piece , " says Lanvin 's Alber Elbaz . " There is something very protective about a coat . " They need to go over everything and have day-to-night and work-to-weekend versatility , so can you really wear a hot-pink , cocoon , or fuzzy-textured coat every day ? Yes ! A standout option can enliven any outfit , and it 's perfectly acceptable to wear it all the time . " It 's a little too fashion victimy to come up with a new coat every single day , " says Easley .

Photograph : Gucci If you are limited to making do with what 's in your closet , do n't fret ; you wo n't necessarily look pass . Designer Zac Posen suggests some DIY techniques for modernizing an old standby . " Cut the sleeves off , and make it into a vest to be worn with a long sweater , " he suggests . If that 's too much effort for you , a standard coat can easily be updated , thanks to the plethora of cold-weather accents out there . " Because of the explosive new fashion options , there is a domino effect in terms of the importance of gloves and hats , " says Fargo . " The accessories have to be part of the ensemble . " It 's simple to make a timeless double-breasted piece look of the moment with Prada 's color-blocked gauntlets or Karl Lagerfeld 's neon driving gloves .

But you can justify your purchases by knowing that if you love your coat , you 're sure to get the necessary bang for your buck . " They are big investments , but they are worth it , " says Goldman . " A woman will buy a dress and wear it once to an event ; she 'll buy a coat and hem and haw over the same price yet wear it all the time . Wear your coat ! It totally pays off . Your coat should owe you money by the end of the season ! " Photograph : Dior by John Galliano <p>
