The Forsaken A Vampire Huntress Legend By Banks , L. A. St. Martin 's Griffin Banks , L. A. Chapter One The Shift The day after Christmas , a horrific tsunami hit Southeast Asia , creating a natural and human disaster of biblical proportions . Disease and destruction lay in the wake of the giant wave , flooding and taking lives in eleven countries to the scale of Noah 's time . But the animals sensed it was coming and were mysteriously saved . Ancient tribesmen , observant of nature 's force , also strangely avoided destruction . But the cities . . . the tourists , all lay in ruins . Humanity is now studying the instinctual nature of the animal kingdom . Tribal elders were asked how they knew , but their simplistic answers baffled scientists until debunked . People in the fishing villages feared to eat the sea 's yield , even while starving . . . so many bodies were in the water , and they reasoned that the fish had feasted upon that which the waters took . Beyond the human suffering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands missing , and millions left homeless and destitute with food shortages and tainted water , the power of the event actually shifted the planet -- the Earth 's poles moved to the east by a full inch , and time stopped for several milliseconds . It moved to the east . . . to the east . . . the east . . . perhaps east ofEden . We do not yet know how this will influence the Earth 's position amongst its planetary brethren . What we do know , however , is that everything in the universe is a fragile balance , like that of an immaculately designed Swiss watch . Move one part and misalign one gear , and then what ? Astrologers have yet to weigh in on this matter , nor has the traditional scientific community . They simply have no answers . All this while in the United States , Southern California has been deluged by unrelenting rains and the normally arid region was also covered by a blanket of snow . . . over one hundred and fifty inches has fallen on the Sierra Mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Texas and the Midwest experienced driving snowstorms . . . the Ohio Valley was covered in ice and floodwaters , forcing evacuations . . . this after four back-to-back hurricanes just devastated Florida 's coast and the Caribbean , then one came that virtually wiped New Orleans off the map . Still there were more hurricanes , floods , tornados . . . forces of nature , also known by insurance companies as acts of God . And , yet the world is still at war . Not even these cataclysmic events were enough to give mankind pause . In the ongoing human conflict , no one seemed to remember that even time stood still . The planet was rocked off its axis for milliseconds , but warring factions around the globe did n't seem to give a damn . They just kept on fighting , shooting , and blowing each other up . The stern warning is not being heeded . Continues ... by Banks , L. A.                    @
