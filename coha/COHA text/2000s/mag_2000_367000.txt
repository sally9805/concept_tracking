Her hair may prompt you to write her off as a gimmick . Pink ? As it turns out , this 20-year-old 's music is better than her name . Pink offers up a fresh take on the genre of blue-eyed soul : she sings Aaliyah-style , hip-hop-fueled R. and B. , with confidence and cool . Her lyrics are full of attitude , but her smooth , seductive vocals go down easy . Pink 's future looks golden . Let 's hope she does n't dye her hair yellow to match it . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
