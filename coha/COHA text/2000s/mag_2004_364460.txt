WHY DID JESUS HAVE TO DIE ? <P> Jesus ' life and death were an example to us April 12 . He had to die to be resurrected . Jesus attempted to show us that death is not the end . He was trying to remove some of the fear and desperation from our lives and prove that we are more than meaningless specks of dust on this planet . We have eternal life . ELIZABETH PALMER-BIGLER Holiday , Fla . <P> Thank you for presenting the reactions of believers over the centuries to the Passion of Christ . I have never believed that Jesus died in order to satisfy some sort of debt . In his life , his death and his reappearance , Christ came to show us God the Father . Why remains a joyous mystery . NORMA MELONE Campbell , Calif . <P> The death and resurrection of Jesus are a revelation on a grand scale of what takes place in every life . We all go through suffering and joy , death and resurrection , on one level or another . The energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle is the presence of Christ 's spirit in us . Why did Jesus die ? To show us how life works and to empower us to live fully now and forever . ( THE REV . ) HAL WALLOF Providence Forge , Va . <P> What am I missing ? I thought Jesus was sent by God to live and die as a man , to suffer and bear our sins . His Resurrection is a sign of God 's forgiveness and everlasting life for all who believe in him . LIZ WINSTANLEY Issaquah , Wash . <P> Jesus stood up to the injustices of the world and was crushed in the process . That is happening all over the world today , and not only to Christians . People of every religion who see wrongs and try to right them lose their lives . That is what the Christian spirit is all about . LOUIS OSTROM Madison , Wis . <P> There is no Quid Pro Quo with God . The lesson of the Crucifixion and Resurrection was meant to be simple , not something to crease the brows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is manifest and resides in the godly among us  --  those who tirelessly and earnestly work in the service of humankind . EDWARD HUJSAK La Jolla , Calif . <P> Christ died in a dramatic and painful way to demonstrate that even in the most ignominious death , there is a spectacular resolution . Thus death is not the end of hope or life . Christ 's death was necessary so he could rise again , the ultimate proof that he was no longer a son of man but the Son of God . CARLOS M. MAGALLANES Pasadena , Calif . <P> It is inappropriate to look for explanations of Jesus ' death that blame God . God is not the one who killed him but the one who raised him from the dead . Jesus died because those in power ordered him killed . They could not tolerate someone who challenged the status quo as forcefully and thoroughly as Jesus was capable of doing . ( THE REV . ) DOUGLAS P. CUNNINGHAM New York City <P> The varied explanations of Jesus ' death reflect the myriad ways we approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what kind of questions you have , they can be answered . The way to understanding the reason for Jesus ' death lies somewhere closer to embracing all the serious interpretations rather than just one . By integrating the different ideas about Jesus ' death , its real meaning for each individual can be found . GILES BOLAND Wellesley , Mass.
