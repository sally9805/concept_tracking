Frankly , I 'm getting a little tired of Nicole Kidman 's nose . First she donned about 5 lbs . of proboscis prosthetics to more closely resemble Virginia Woolf in The Hours . Now she 's learned to make it wrinkle and twinkle the way Elizabeth Montgomery did on Bewitched some 40 years ago . It 's cute for a while , then wearisome . <P> Much the same could be said of Nora Ephron 's movie . It has a good premise : down-on-his-luck movie actor Jack Wyatt ( Will Ferrell ) agrees to do a remake of the old TV show ( 1964-72 ) but casts an unknown to play Samantha so he , playing her husband Darrin , can dominate the program . The role goes to Isabel Bigelow ( Kidman ) , who really is a witch , although she 's trying to break the habit . But you ca n't make a laff riot out of what is essentially a straight man 's role , and Jack bombs . Even the family dog scores higher approval ratings with the test audience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy and more of a show-biz one . <P> But something misses here . Maybe funny witches are just too retro . Maybe the lack of chemistry between Kidman and Ferrell has something to do with it . Ferrell , in particular , does n't seem to want to be as edgy  --  all right , insanely self-involved  --  as he might be . And , it seems , Ephron ( who co-wrote the script with her sister Delia ) also wants everyone to make nice . Whatever air the picture has goes whooshing out of it when the stars do a romantic dance . It 's reminiscent of Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds in a similar setting in Singin ' in the Rain . Except these stars ca n't dance  --  not romantically , soaringly , anyway  --  and although one applauds Ephron 's romantic impulse , it is one about which she might have thought twice . <P> Bewitched means to be a civilized entertainment , which occasionally it is . But the gentility of this antique sitcom can not be recaptured at this late date . What this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that Ephron and friends lack the low cunning to deliver .  --  By Richard Schickel
