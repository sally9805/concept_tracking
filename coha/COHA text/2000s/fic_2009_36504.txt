Tuesday , April 24 <p> Today was n't so bad . Carly seems to have made friends with the bottle finally . When my milk stopped she went on a hunger strike , pushed formula away like it was vinegar . Then she 'd only take it from Aunt Jude , of all people . Never thought I 'd be so happy to see her on a daily basis . But now even I 'm allowed to feed her . Time marches on , I guess . <p> This is n't working . <p> Father Jake is now officially in the deep end without a lifeguard . <p> Thursday , April 26 <p> Dylan 's pretending to play Monopoly . He just likes rolling the dice . I 'm not allowed to play because I ruin it ; he says he ca n't think what rules he wants to have when I 'm watching . I know how he feels . I ca n't think what rules I want to have when I 'm around , either . <p> Not sure why I 'm trying this again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Options seem to be dwindling since I jumped ship on the grief group she found on the Internet , Googling her way to my happiness . But , please , it was worse than bad . That facilitator was so annoying . Her lipstick was orange , her shoes were pointy , and she looked like an upscale elf . That constant sympathetic nod she did made me want to throw my drippy tissue wads at her . Add six or eight people wailing in self-pity , and you might as well crack open the Chex Mix , because hey-it 's a party ! <p> I might tell Father Jake not to come anymore . Pretty much a waste of time , though I suppose it 's good cover . After the grief group did n't work out , I figured Aunt Jude was planning an intervention . But all I got were visits from the boy priest , Father Listener . <p> He 's the one who came up with this journaling idea , which is gimmicky and hideously ' 70s . ( What 's his next idea-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had handed me one of those cheesy blank books with teacups or inspirational sayings on it , I would have dug out Robby 's blowtorch and lit it up on the hood of that boring gray sedan Father drives . <p> Actually I would have just given it to Dylan with a box of Magic Markers . " Grief " makes you sound so melodramatic . <p> Janie closed the 89-cent black-and-white-speckled composition notebook . It reminded her of one she 'd had in third grade for the purpose of practicing her cursive writing . She would sit at Aunt Jude 's kitchen table after school , gripping the pen as if it might get away from her and do some certain but unspecified damage . All those loops and slanty lines . So messy and complicated compared to the clear clean strokes of the printing she had been used to . <p> The doorbell rang , jolting Janie from her memory . She tucked the notebook in the cabinet above the refrigerator and forced herself to face the intrusion , hoping it was n't another pity offering of quiche or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped coming by , sensing , she knew , that their company was all but unbearable to her . It was just too hard to answer that stupid question over and over . " How are you ? " She could barely keep herself from saying , Still shitty , thanks for asking . Care for some ham ? God knows I ca n't eat it . <p> The man who now stood at the door carried nothing but a smudged manila folder . He scratched his fingers through the caramel-colored hair over a recently healed scar on his forearm . " Hi , " he said , squinting into the room 's relative dimness , the faint lines around his eyes clustering against each other . " Rob around ? " <p> " No , " said Janie . <p> " Uh , well , can you give him this ? " He held out the folder . " I told him I could n't start ' til summer , but then another job got postponed , so I 'll start here next week . Permit 's already pulled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must have been hard for him to see the face . " I 'll pick those up tomorrow . If he wants to call me , the number 's there . " <p> The man waited for a response , which was not forthcoming . Janie stared back at him for a second , then glanced away . " Okay , " he said , his lips flattening into a confused smile . He walked quickly to his truck . When he opened the driver 's side door , Jane saw " Malinowski Custom Design , Inc. " written in curling maroon script on the door panel . " Pelham , Mass. " was in smaller type below it . <p> He 's from here , she thought . Not that it mattered . <p> " Who was that ? " Dylan asked , the little metal Monopoly dog bounding around the board . <p> " Some guy , " said Janie , and tossed the manila folder on the stairs . <p> Thursday Night <p> It 's my screened porch . Maybe a birthday present ? Where on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already signed a contract with that Malinucci guy . He said he did n't need a new car , even though the Subaru was twelve years old . Said he 'd ask for a raise at the bank if I wanted to hold off going back to work at the hospital . Robby , goddammit . I do n't want the stupid porch now . <p> Shelly Michelman banged on the front door , opened it a face-width , and yelled " Hey ! " <p> " It 's open , " Janie called from the back of the house . This was not very far . It was a small house , a Cape , the modern version of a Colonial style that had been built with zeal throughout the Boston suburbs in the 1930s and ' 40s . The front door opened directly into the living room . To the right was the kitchen , just big enough to hold a round butcher-block table and four chairs . The painted white cabinets , and counters devoid of all but the most necessary small appliances , kept it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen and led up to two bedrooms on the second floor , their ceilings slanting down toward eaves on the front and back of the house . Janie was in the tiny office behind the living room rummaging through bank statements . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
