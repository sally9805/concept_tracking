Headnote Each Cassini flyby fills in details of this frostbitten saturnian moon shaped by forces identical to those that sculpted Earth 's surface . * BY MICHAEL CARROLL Acrescent Saturn slices an arc through a crystalline blue sky . Snow-dusted rocks tower above icy plains . This was the Titan of the 1940s , a world immortalized in the paintings of pioneering space artist Chesley Bonestell . In fact , his painting of Titan 's surface , which graced the cover of Willy Ley 's and Bonestell 's 1949 bestselling book The Conquest of Space , has been called the best-known work of space art ever created . Bonestell 's vision reflected the scientific thinking of the time . But research soon showed that Titan was not a clear-skied desert world . Instead , its ruddy hue traces to a thick shroud of orange smog . Discovery of methane in Titan 's atmosphere raised the possibility of hydrocarbon seas . But the smog and Titan 's great distance kept its secrets hidden . After the Hubble Space Telescope provided tantalizing peeks under Titan 's shroud in the 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the day the European Space Agency ( ESA ) Huygens probe dropped into Titan 's atmosphere and parachuted to the surface . And what did it see ? Earth . " We now have the key to understanding what shapes Titan 's landscape , " mission scientist Martin Tomasko told reporters at ESA 's headquarters in Paris . " Geological evidence for precipitation , erosion , mechanical abrasion , and other lluvial liquid-driven activity say that the physical processes shaping Titan are much the same as those shaping Earth . " And these processes would be utterly familiar to any first-year college geology student . " We see dendritic channels , which are the result of liquid erosion , " says Cassini imaging-team leader Carolyn Porco of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colorado . " VVe see dark hydrocarbons washed from the highlands , pooling in low-lying areas . We see aeolian wind-driven effects . We see cloud systems . In short , we are seeing earthlike processes , but they are occurring in unearthlike materials . " With every new flyby of Titan , Cassini paints a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonestell could envision . We are finally beginning to understand Saturn 's largest moon as a world in its own right , even though it seems just like home in some fundamental ways . Early glimpses To understand the scientific journey to Titan , we must look back in time . Voyager 1 flew past Titan in 1980 , followed by Voyager 2 in 1981 . The craft radioed back portraits of an orange tinted orb with an atmosphere 1.5 times denser than Earth 's . Voyager flyby data fueled earlier suspicions that Titan 's surface might harbor lakes or seas of the hydrocarbons methane or ethane , and that Titan 's skies may drench the surface in a rain of hydrocarbon-based molecules - potential building blocks for organic life . Despite Voyagers ' batteries of instruments , neither craft penetrated Titan 's clouds to glimpse the landscape below . The only way to unveil Saturn 's mystery moon would be to observe it in wavelengths of light that pass through the obscuring cloud cover . In October 1994 , flight engineers commanded the Hubble Space Telescope 's Wide Field and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's long wavelengths bounced otf surface features and then passed back through Titan 's cloud cover out to space , where Hubble imaged them . The new Hubble snapshots revealed dark and light features on the surface . Could these be the predicted hydrocarbon oceans ? Or were they just solid surface features ? The Cassini revolution The answers would finally come with the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn . The Cassini orbiter carries synthetic aperture radar , similar to the radar instrument the Magellan spacecraft used in 1990-1994 to peer through Venus ' cloud cover and map its surface . Cassinis imaging system also peers through the clouds in near-infrared , just like Hubble did . The European Huygens probe would complete the reconnaissance by parachuting to Titan 's surface while sniffing its atmosphere and taking snapshots of the terrain below . Visible and infrared imaging from Cassinis first Titan flyby , in October 2004 , revealed a surface with dark and bright regions in complex patterns . No features were immediately recognizable as mountains , rivers , or meteor impact craters . " At first the images were very ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of haze . We saw no shadows . We could n't say what was up or down . " Cassini 's radar helped clarify things . Microwaves beamed lrom Cassinis main antenna pierced Titan 's atmospheric haze , bounced oil the surlace , and returned to the craft . Patterns in the returning radar " echoes " provided clues to Titan 's topography and surface composition , such as whether the dark patches were liquid . Titanic volcanoes The first sharp radar images came in a few days after Cassinis inaugural flyby of Titan . A radar scan along a strip nearly 5,000 miles ( 8,000 kilometers ) long showed smooth plains and rugged highlands . But mission scientists also saw a prominent , 110-mile-wide ( 180 km ) circular feature spanning the strip from top to bottom . They named the structure Ganesa , after the elephant headed Hindu god . The scientists wondered if Ganesa were a scar from a past meteor impact . A closer look showed otherwise . Ganesa appeared to be a volcano . " We realized it was n't an impact feature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explains Rosaly Lopes , a Cassini radar team member at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California . Pancake domes are flat-topped volcanic mountains on Venus built by eruptions of molten rock , or magma - just like volcanism on Earth . But Titan 's surface , although hard as rock , is mainly frozen water . Instead of molten rock , Ganesa erupts a slushy " cryomagma " composed of melted water , perhaps mixed with ammonia . " We now think that Ganesa may be a shield volcano , " says Lopes , an expert in extraterrestrial volcanism who leads JPL 's geophysics and planetary geosciences team . Volcanic shields consist of multiple runny lava flows that gradually form a broad , gently sloping structure resembling an upturned shield . Hawaii 's Big Island is Earth 's grandest shield volcano , and Ganesa looks eerily similar . This suggests they may have formed by the same basic process . Some cryomagma flows on Titan are massive . About 1,375 miles ( 2,200 km ) from Ganesa lies a flow , named Rohe Fluctus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick . To pile up that high , cryomagma would need to be thicker than a waterammonia slurry . Lopes and several colleagues proposed in the February 2007 issue of Icarus that a dash of methanol would make the flows viscous enough to account for their thickness . Cryovolcanism is not simply an occasional gurgle of slush ; it 's a major force for change on Titan . The flow dubbed Winia Fluctus covers at least 9,150 square miles ( 23,700 square kilometers ) , or slightly less than the area of Vermont . Sub-zero cryovolcanism may have substantially shaped Titan 's icy surface , just as molten-hot volcanism has transformed Earth 's rocky surface , over billions of years . And it may still . Mission scientists are on the lookout for signs of recent eruptions . Huygens away ! On December 24 , 2004 , the Cassini orbiter dispatched its hitchhiker , the European Space Agency 's Huygens probe . Three weeks later , Huygens entered Titan 's atmosphere and released a series of parachutes to slow its 2 ' ' /2-hour descent to the surface . The craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down - data to feed computer models of Titan 's atmosphere . After passing through the cloud deck , Huygens snapped aerial photos of river-cut hills and flat regions that may be dry lake-beds . Artery-like systems of drainage channels went from highlands to lowlands . These so-called dendritic channels are the hallmark of surfaces on Earth drained by streams and rivers . But the liquid could not be water ; at - 291 F ( - 180 C ) , Titan is far too cold . It had to be methane , which is gaseous at earthly temperatures but remains a liquid on frosty Titan . The big " aha " moment for the Huygens team arrived when the probe descended to between 10 and 5 miles ( 16 and 8 km ) above the surface . " This was the altitude at which Huygens saw dendritic channels , " says Porco . " We could be confident the dark , meandering features in our images were probably eroded by liquid . " Huygens revealed surprises and confirmed suspicions . For one , methane vapor in the atmosphere remained near saturation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methane hiding ? " To have that much methane in the atmosphere , we really suspected that liquid bodies were lying down there somewhere , recharging the atmospheric methane , " explains Rosaly Lopes . Land of lakes Soon the liquid bodies - or what mission scientists think are liquid bodies - came into view . In July 2006 , Cassinis orbit carried it to 85 north latitude , farther north than on any previous pass . Its radar system returned images of channels , embayments , ami ver dark , well-defined areas with shorelines . Radar sees smooth regions ( like a liquid surface ) as dark , and these bodies were as dark as the system could detect . " Finally we have a source of all that methane , " Lopes says . Many are oval or arc-shaped , but several have the appearance of liquid-filled calderas , features that form on Earth when volcanoes collapse . Each additional Cassini radar pass returned additional evidence of river valleys , basins , and regions similar to embayed shorelines . One image included a dark , kidney-shaped feature resembling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closest thing to a lake we had seen , but we could n't be sure it was filled with liquid or with some sort of dark deposit , " Porco recalls . " We were on the fence . " Several of the suspected lakes were ringed by concentric shorelines , like those formed on Earth when evaporation deposits minerals along a lake 's rim . Mission scientists continue searching for evidence of scattering , a radar-echo pattern indicating wave action on a liquid surface . The methane cycle Both Huygens and Cassini confirmed that a constant methane drizzle falls over about half the moon 's surface , thus explaining why Huygens landed in methane mud , " There appears to be more methane in the atmosphere than on the surface , " says astrobiologist Chris McKay of the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , California . " It would seem that the atmosphere has a bit more methane than it can hold . " The rain forms in methane-nitrogen clouds at an altitude of 12.5 miles ( 20 km ) . Above that cloud deck , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice crystals . The methane humidity increases closer to the poles , where the lakes were found . Planetary scientists want to understand how methane moves from cloud to ground and back to cloud again . On Earth , the medium is water - solid , liquid , and gas . These materials shuttle between land and sea in a global " water cycle . " Titan has an analogous cycle based on methane . " We do n't yet understand the methane cycle on Titan , " says McKay . " It was expected that there would be lakes over much of the surface , and we were surprised to find them only in the north polar regions . " It 's winter in the north , accounting for methane lakes . When summer comes , the lakes may evaporate and reform in the wintry south . " Many people assume that these lakes are seasonal and will move to the south polar region when winter comes to that pole in 15 years , " McKay explains . One unsolved mystery is what mechanism recharges the methane cycle . Lopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactions between sunlight and hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere remove methane , cryovolcanism may release fresh supplies from below . Brave new world So far , the spectacularly successful Cassini-Huygens mission has revealed the broad brush strokes of " Titan 's geology and atmosphere , completely revising Bonestell 's 1940s vision of this alien moon . Next come the fine touches and highlights , the important details of how Titan works . For example , we see vast fields of dunes , most likely composed of ice crystals . How do they fit into the liquid methane cycle ? " Huygens showed us that it rains on Titan , " Lopes says . " But the dunes must form as dry particles . Many of these dunes are close to channels , so what is going on with this methane cycle ? It may be that these regions go through periodic droughts , like in terrestrial deserts . " Researchers hope future llybys will reveal more about the physical relationships between dunes and liquid surface methane . Another Titan mystery concerns the handful of meteor craters spotted so far . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impacting meteors excavate craters much as they do on Faith . The largest confirmed crater , Minerva , is a classic impact basin 50 miles ( 80 km ) across . The odd thing about Titan 's craters is the lack of smaller examples , in the range of 12 to 18 miles ( 20 to 30 km ) in diameter . Computer models suggest Cassinis radar should be seeing these , but it does n't . Where did they go ? Does some as-yet-unknown surface process obscure the craters , or are they simply swamped in by organic particles raining from the sky ? As Cassini gathers more information on Titan , scientists anticipate more answers and even moie mysteries . As the Cassini-Huygens team basks in well-deserved glory , NASA headquarters has requested studies for follow-up missions , including another Titan orbiter , a blimp-like " aerobot " probe to explore Titan 's surface , and a more advanced Saturn orbiter designed to do multiple Titan llybys . The planned scientific armada will help discover more of the secrets Titan 's clouds have kept veiled loi centuries . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wisdom , " Lopes says . " To understand Titan , we 'll need all the wisdom and help we can get ! " Sidebar AT THE SHORE of a Titan lake , liquid methane laps the coast as a blimp-like " aerobot " drops a tethered device to collect lakeshore mud for analysis . In the distance , clouds rain methane onto the surface , where it collects in low-lying areas of Titan 's northerly " lake district . " MICHAEL CARROLL FOR ASTRONOMY Sidebar AN INFRARED VIEW of Titan 's surface reveals dark surface features but no fine details . Radar images ultimately unlocked Titan 's secrets by peeling away the moon 's obscuring clouds . NASA/JPL/SPACE SCIENCE INSTITUTE Sidebar MISSION SCIENTISTS initially thought this feature , Ganesa Macula , might be a meteor impact crater . But it turned out to be a wide , gently sloping " cryovolcano " that has erupted a slushy mix of water and ammonia from Titan 's icy crust .

ESA/NASA/JPL/UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA Sidebar Inside Titan TITAN 'S INTERIOR structure remains a mystery . But planetary scientist Giuseppe Mitri of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has developed a theoretical model of Titan 's interior that describes one possibility . In Mitri 's model , Titan has a warm rocky core surrounded by a layer of compressed ice about 1.4 times denser than common ice . ( The high-pressure layer formed as Titan was cooling and contracting in the early solar system . ) An ocean of water and ammonia underlies Titan 's frozen outer crust . Sidebar COMPLEX COASTLINES are common on Earth but also on Titan , judging from this Cassini radar image . Because the small , isolated islands follow the same trend as the peninsulas on land , this coast may be part of a flooded mountain ridge . NASA/JPL Sidebar GANESA MAY BE similar to shield volcanoes on Earth , such as Hawaii 's Mauna Loa . As shown in this artist 's rendition , Ganesa has a broad base and gently sloping sides . Many cryolava flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ganesa over time . MICHAEL CARROLL ON TITAN , residual heat from the moon 's formation may heat water and ammonia to form cryomagma . Ganesa sports a central vent where cryomagma flowed upward and spilled onto the surface . The summit vent may be connected to the subsurface zone of melting by a system of branching fractures . Right now , this vision of Ganesa 's plumbing is plausible speculation . Cassini mission scientists have plenty of work left to do just to assess the extent of cryovolcanism on Titan and whether it actively shapes the moon today . ASTRONOMY JAY SMITH Sidebar A GIANT METHANE cloud in Titan 's north polar region may produce methane rain that collects in the moon 's lakes . NASA/JPL Sidebar DUNE FIELDS on Titan may consist of frozen methane or water-ice grains . The sheer scale of the dune fields , extending for hundreds of kilometers , hints at Titan 's dynamic environment . NASA/JPL WHILE FLYING over Titan 's polar region , Cassini spied this island .

NASA/JPL Sidebar CASSINI RADAR captured part of what might be an impact crater roughly 110 miles ( 180 km ) wide . Only three craters are known on Titan now . Their rarity suggests active and recent processes smooth the moon 's surface .
