Chapter 2 " The stones were sharp , The wind came at my back ; Walking along the highway , Mincing like a cat . "  --  Theodore Roethke , " Praise to the End ! " The wind whipped tiny pebbles of rain across Kaye 's face . The droplets froze her hands , making her shiver as they slid down her wet hair and under the collar of her coat . She walked , head down , kicking the scattered trash that had eddied up on the grassy shores along the highway . A flattened soda can skittered into a sodden chrysanthemum-covered foam heart , staked there to mark the site of a car crash . There were no houses on this side of the road , just a long stretch of wet woods leading up to a gas station . She was over halfway home . Cars hissed over the asphalt . The sound was comforting , like a long sigh . I saw you . I saw what you did . Awfulness twisted in her gut , awfulness and anger . She wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done anything ? When she tried to make a magazine page turn on its own or a penny land on heads , it never worked . How could she have made Kenny see a broken-legged carousel horse move ? Never mind that she might as well assume that Spike and Lutie and Gristle had been imaginary . She 'd been home for two weeks , and there was no sign of them , no matter how many times she had called them , no matter how many bowls of milk she left out , no matter how many times she went down to the old creek . She took a deep breath , snorting rain up her nose . It reminded her of crying . The trees seemed like flat lead panels missing the stained glass to fit between their branches . She knew what her grandmother was going to say when she got back , stinking of liquor with a torn shirt . True things . The same things that Janet would say tomorrow . There was no way to explain what had happened without admitting to something . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about  --  that , and that she had let it rest there , even if only for a moment . And she could imagine what he was telling Janet now  --  flushed , angry , and drunk  --  but even a badly managed lie would sound better than the truth . I saw it stand up . But even if he did n't go that far , who would believe that he touched her crotch on purpose , but ripped her shirt by accident ? No , he must have told an entirely different story . So what was Kaye supposed to say when Janet asked what happened ? Janet thought she was a liar already . She could still feel the heat of Kenny 's hand , a stroke of fire along her thigh in contrast to her otherwise rain-soaked skin . Another gust of rain stung her cheeks , this one bringing a shout with it from the direction of the woods . The noise was brief , but eloquent with pain . Kaye stopped abruptly . There was no sound except the rain , hissing like radio static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking up a cloud of drizzle , she heard another sound . Softer , this one , maybe a moan bitten off at the end . It was just inside the copse of trees . Kaye moved down the slight slope , off the short grass and into the woods . She ducked under the dripping branches of an elm , stepping on tufts of short ferns and looping briars . Weeds brushed across her calves , leaving strokes of rain . The storm-bright sky lit the woods with silver . An earthy , sweet odor of rot bloomed where she disturbed the carpet of leaves . There was no one there . She half turned toward the highway . She could still see the road from where she was standing . What was she doing ? The sound must have carried over from the houses beyond the thin river that ran along the back of the woods . No one else would be dumb enough to go trooping through wet , dripping woods in the middle of the night . Kaye walked back up to the road , picking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burrs had collected along her stockings , and she bent down to pull them off . " Stay where you are . " She jumped at the voice . The accent was rich and strange , though the words were pronounced precisely . A man was sprawled in the mud only a few steps from her , clutching a curved sword in one hand . It shone like a sliver of moonlight in the hazy dark . Long pewter hair , plastered wetly to his neck , framed a face that was long and full of sharp angles . Rivulets of rain ran over the jointed black armor he wore . His other hand was at his heart , clutching a branch that jutted from his chest . The rain there was tinted pink with blood . " Was it you , girl ? " He was breathing raggedly . Kaye was n't sure what he meant , but she shook her head . He did n't look much older than she was . Certainly not old enough to call her " girl . " " So you have n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He was long-limbed  --  he would be tall if he were standing . Taller than most people , taller than any faerie she had ever seen  --  still , she had no doubt that was what he was , if for no other reason than the pointed tops of his ears knifing through his wet hair  --  and that he was beautiful in a way that made her breath catch . He licked his lips . There was blood on them . " Pity , " he said quietly . She took a step toward him , and he twisted into a defensive crouch . Wounded as he was , he still moved swiftly . Hair fell forward across his face , but his eyes , shining like mercury , studied her intently . " You 're a faerie , are n't you ? " she said soothingly , holding her hands where he could see them . She had heard stories of the court fey  --  the Gentry  --  from Lutie-loo , but she had never seen one . Maybe that was what he was . He stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding out one hand to coax him as if he were some fascinating , dangerous animal . " Let me help you . " His body was trembling with concentration . His eyes never flickered from her face . He held the hilt of his sword in a white-knuckled grip . She did not dare take another step . " You 're going to bleed to death . " They stayed like that a few more minutes before he slumped down to one knee in the mud . He bent forward , fingers clutching the leaves , and spat red . The wet lashes over his half-closed eyes were as silver as a safety pin . She took two steps and knelt down next to him , bracing herself with shaking hands . This close , she could see that his armor was stiff leather sculpted to look like feathers . " I can not draw the arrow myself , " he said softly . " They are waiting for me to bleed a little more before they come against my blade . " " Who is waiting ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tree branch , but that seemed to be what he was saying . " If you would help me , draw this arrow . " His eyes narrowed , and he shook his head . " If not , then push it in as deep as you can and hope that it kills me . " " It will bleed more , " Kaye said . He laughed at that , a bitter sound . " Either way , no doubt . " She could see the despair in his face . He obviously believed her to be part of some plan to kill him . Still , he slid his body back until he could lean against the trunk of an oak . He was braced , waiting to see what she would do . She thought of the faeries she had known when she was a child  --  impish , quick things  --  no mention of wars or magical arrows or enemies , certainly no lies , no deception . The man bleeding in the dirt beside her told her how wrong her perceptions of Faery had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest . Her lungs turned to ice as she looked at the grisly wound . " I ca n't do it . " His voice stayed soft . " What do they call you ? " " Kaye , " she said . There was silence for a moment as she noticed the cold cloud of her breath rise up with the word . " I 'm Roiben . " Faeries did n't give their names easily , even part of their names , although she had no idea why . He was trying to show her that he trusted her , maybe trying to make up for the assumptions he had made about her . " Give me your hand . " She let him take her hand in his and guide it to the branch . His hand closed over hers , both of them chilled and wet , his fingers inhumanly long and rough with calluses . " Just close your hand on it and let me pull , " he said . " You do n't even have to look . As long as I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . " That shamed her . She had told him that she wanted to help him , he was in a whole lot of pain , and it was no time for her to be squeamish . " I 'll do it , " she said . Roiben let go of her hand , and she gave a sharp tug . Although his face constricted with pain , the branch only pulled out a short way . Were there really other faerie folk in the trees , waiting for him to be weak enough to defeat ? Kaye thought that if so , now was a great time for them to come down and have a go at it . " Again , Kaye . " She took note of the angle of the armor this time , changing her position so that the branch could n't catch on one of the plates . She raised herself to one knee , braced , and then stood , pulling upward as hard as she could . Roiben gave a harsh cry as the branch slid free of his chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wound and he raised them , slick with blood , as if suddenly disbelieving that he had been shot . " Very brave , " he said , touching his wet fingers to her leg . Kaye tossed the stick away from her . She was shuddering , and she could taste the ghost of blood in her mouth . " We have to stop the bleeding . How does your armor come off ? " He seemed not to understand her at first . He just looked at her with a kind of incredulity . Then he leaned forward with a groan . " Straps , " he managed . She came and sat behind him , feeling over the smooth armor for buckles . A sudden wind shook the branches above , raining an extra shower of heavy droplets down on them , and Kaye wondered again about faeries in the trees . Her fingers fumbled in her haste . If those faeries were still afraid of Roiben , they did n't have to worry for much longer  --  she was betting that it would be only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get off his breastplate , she not only had to detach it from the backplate at his shoulders and sides  --  there were also straps that connected it to the shoulderplates and to his legplates . Finally , she managed to peel it off his chest . Underneath , the bare skin was mottled with blood . He tipped back his head and closed his eyes . " Let the rain clean it . " She pulled off her coat and hung it on one of the branches of the tree . Her shirt was ripped already , she reminded herself as she took it off . She tore it into long strips and began winding them around Roiben 's chest and arms . He opened his eyes when she touched him . His eyes narrowed , then widened . Their color was mesmerizing . He straightened up , horrified . " I did n't even hear you rip the cloth . " " You have to try to stay awake . " Kaye 's cheeks felt so warm that the cold rain actually felt good against them . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Fumbling near him , he picked up a leaf and wiped it against the underside of the leather breastplate . It came away shining red . " Drop this in the stream . I  --  there is a kelpie there  --  it is no sure thing that I will be able to control her in this weather , but it is something . " Kaye nodded quickly , although she had no idea what a kelpie was , and made to take the leaf . He did not let it go immediately . " I am in your debt . I mislike not knowing how I must repay it . " " I have questions ... " He let her take the leaf . " I will answer three , as full and well as is within my power . " She nodded . Like a faerie tale . Fine ; it was n't as if she had wanted anything from him anyway . " When you drop the leaf in the water , say Roiben of the Unseelie Court asks for your aid . " " Say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She nodded again and ran in the direction of the water . The steep bank of the stream was choked with vegetation and broken glass . Roots , swept bare of the mud that should have surrounded them , sat above the bank like overturned baskets or ran along the ground like the pale arms of half-buried corpses . She forbade herself to think of that again . She squatted down and set the leaf , blood side down , into the water . It floated there , spinning a little . She wondered if it was too close to the bank , and tried to blow it farther out . " Roiben of the Unseelie Court asks for your help , " she said , hoping that she had gotten it right . Nothing happened . She said it again , louder , feeling foolish and frightened at the same time . " Roiben of the Unseelie Court needs your help . " A frog surfaced and began to swim in her direction . Would that have something to do with a kelpie ? What kind of help were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then she saw that she had been mistaken . What she had taken for the eyes of a frog were actually hollow pits that quavered as something swam through the water toward her . She wanted to run , but fascination combined with obligation to root her to the spot . Hollow pits formed into flaring nostrils on the snout of a black horse that rose up from the black water as if created from it . Moss and mud slid from its dripping flanks as the thing turned its head to regard Kaye with luminous white eyes . She could not move . How many minutes passed as she stared at those mottled gray flanks , smooth as sealskin , and stared into the impossible glow of those eyes ? The creature inclined its neck . Kaye took a half step backward and tried to speak . No words came . The horse-thing snuffled closer to her , its hooves sinking in the mud , snapping twigs . It smelled of brackish water . She took another careful step backward and stumbled . She had to say something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the trees . " He 's this way . " The horse moved in the direction she pointed , speeding up to a trot , and she was left to follow it , nearly shaking with relief . When she got to the clearing , Roiben was already straddling the creature 's back . His breastplate had been haphazardly strapped on . She let out a breath she had n't known she was holding . He saw her emerge from under the canopy of branches and smiled . His eyes seemed darker in the moonlight . " Were I you , I would stay clear of the Folk in the future . We are a capricious people , with little regard for mortals . " She looked at him again . There were scratches on his armor that she did n't remember . Could he have been attacked ? He could barely lift his head before  --  it was impossible to believe that he could have fought with someone . " Did something happen ? " His smile deepened , wiping the weariness from his face . His eyes glittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse rode , moving like no living thing , darting between trees with unearthly speed and grace . Leaves flurried from kicks of its hooves . Moonlight glowed along its flanks . Before she could think , she was alone in the wood . Alone and shivering and proud of herself . She moved to retrieve her coat , and a glimmer of light caught her eye . The arrow . She knelt and picked up the branch with its iron tip . Her finger ran up the rough bark and touched the too-warm metal . A shudder went through her , and she dropped it back in the mud . The woods were suddenly menacing , and she walked as quickly as she could back toward the road . If she started running , she did n't think she 'd be able to stop . Kaye dug her feet into the muddy slope that marked the edge of her grandmother 's lawn and heaved herself up . She slid past the overflowing trash can , the broken-down Pinto , the rusted coffee cans wired together as a fence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house seemed to be on , highlighting the grubby curtains . Blue lights flickered in the living room where the TV was . She opened the backdoor and walked into the kitchen . Pots and pans , crusted with food , were piled in the sink . She was supposed to have washed them . Instead , she went to the cupboard and took out a bowl , filled it with milk , then put a piece of stale white bread on top of it . It would have to do , she thought as she carefully opened the door and set it on the step  --  after all , the only things likely to come for it anymore were neighborhood cats . Kaye crept into the living room . On the other side of the staircase , Ellen was sitting in front of the television , eating one of the miniature Snickers Grandma had bought for the trick-or-treaters . " Leave me the fuck alone , " she muttered to the drink in front of her . " You think I do n't know anything . Okay , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in that too-sweet voice that pissed off Kaye so much . " If you 're so smart , then how come you 're all alone ? How come all these men just use you and leave you ? How come the only one to take you in is your old , stupid mother ? " " I heard you the first million fucking times you said it . " " Well , you 're going to hear it again , " Kaye 's grandmother said . " Where is your daughter tonight ? It 's almost one in the morning ! Do you even care that she 's out gallivanting around who knows where , trying her damnedest to turn out just like  --  " " Do n't you start in on my daughter ! " Kaye 's mother said with surprising vehemence . " She 's just fine . You leave her out of your bitching . " Kaye bent her head down and tried to walk up the stairs as quickly and quietly as she could . She caught her own reflection in the hallway mirror , mascara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , running in crusted and glittering streaks that looked like they were made by tears . Her lipstick was smudged and dull , arching across her left cheek where she must have wiped it . Kaye turned to take a furtive look into the living room . Her mother caught her glance , rolled her eyes , and motioned her up the stairs with a furtive hand movement . " While she 's in this house she 's going to live by the same rules that you lived by . I do n't care that she 's spent the last six years in a rat-infested apartment with whatever hoodlums you took up with . From now on that girl 's going to be raised decent . " Kaye crept the rest of the way up the stairs and into her room . She closed the door as quietly as she could . The tiny white dresser and too-short bed seemed to belong to someone else . Her rats , Isaac and Armageddon , rustled in their fish tank on top of the old toy box . Kaye stripped off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud or anything , climbed into the small bed , wrapped a blanket around herself , and folded her legs so that she fit . Kaye knew what obsession was like  --  she saw how her mother craved fame , pined over men who treated her like shit . She did n't want to want someone she would never have . But just for tonight , she allowed herself to think of him , to think of the solemn , formal way he had spoken to her , so unlike anyone else . She let herself think of his flashing eyes and crooked smile . Kaye slid down into sleep like water closing over her head .
