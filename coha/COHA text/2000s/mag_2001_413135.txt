" It Takes A Village ... " : South Africa " A sack is lighter when carried by two people . " That is a popular saying among the Bafokeng people , a tribe living in the North West Province of South Africa . This saying applies to many issues , including parenting . To us , raising a child is a joint-project between parents , siblings , relatives , teachers and neighbors . " When I was small , my cousins had to take me wherever they went , " Maki says . " Whatever game they were playing , they had to include me , even though most of the time I did n't even understand the rules . Now that I 'm older , I realize that I was likely a nuisance , but they had no choice . Everyone had a job . I was theirs . " Giving older children the responsibility of taking care of the younger ones frees the adults to do other chores in the home or to go to work outside of the home . It also teaches older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sakes , but their charge 's sake . No one denies that parents play a crucial role in raising their children . They love them , provide for them , teach them and prepare them to become contributing members of the community . They stand proudly when their children do well , knowing that their job was well done . They worry when their children do n't do well , and wonder if there was something they could have done differently . However , the traditional family is not always possible . Couples divorce or one dies , leaving one parent responsible for raising the children . " There are so many things that a child needs to learn , " Ditebogo Mokua said . " I 'm a working mother , and widowed , so there are things that I can not teach my sons . I do n't know how to be a man ; sometimes I do n't understand what they are going through , and I need a man to help me with that . Also , I work long hours , sometimes the evening shift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I did not know that my children were safe , that someone was taking care of them . " So Ditebogo 's sons , who are in boarding school , live with her parents during the weekends and school holidays , where they spend tune with their grandfather , who tries hard to teach them about being men . " It 's not easy to do anything around here when there are eyes all over the place watching you , " 16-year Kagiso Mokua , Ditebogo 's son , says . " It 's as if my grandparents " police are everywhere , watching me , and are eager to report on anything wrong that I do . The other day I went to the dam to play with my younger brother and Cousin . We were n't doing anything wrong , just playing around the bank and climbing a few trees " . A neighbor was walking past the dam and saw the boys . That evening , he went to Kagiso 's home and told his grandparents . Young children in the village are not allowed to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could drown . Kagiso , who is old enough to go , should not have taken his cousin Otshepeng , who is only two . School-going children are also accountable to their teachers and school principals for their activities outside as well as inside the school . " One day , our principal saw these three boys from school drinking beer , " Kagiso says . " God knows how they managed to buy it , but there they were , enjoying themselves . It was during the weekend , and they were not wearing school uniforms or anything . On Monday morning , he spoke about it at assembly and called them to his office . They were punished as if they were caught drinking in the school ! " " Although I sometimes complain about living in a goldfish bowl and people not minding their business , I like my life , " Kagiso says . " It 's nice to know where you belong , and what you can expect from the people around you . " Here in our village , children do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grow up knowing where they belong , and where they can go for help when things go wrong . <p>
