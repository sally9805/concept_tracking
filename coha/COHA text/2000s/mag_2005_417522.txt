Before you step into spring 's full skirts , baggy pants and billowy blouses , you need to master the season 's proportions . When in doubt , whittle your waist , says Suzy Menkes // Does my butt look big in this ? " is a question that has reenteted the female psyche . There is no greater fashion dread than suspecting that an outfit adds inches in all the wrong places . So what are we to make of the volumes that are billowing in full sail through the spring season ? From skirts swinging below a ( hopefully ) tiny waist , through folds of a charmeuse blouse and softly draped silk dresses , there seems to be more fabric on offer than we have seen for years in fashion . It is no good turning to the past for inspiration on how to wear this new New Look . It is not about going back to the 1950s or to any other decade-even if the revival of full skirts did start out that way . There is something contemporary and different about volume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sorts out the designers with skill and flair . " It 's all in the handling of the fabric-and using the right fabric , " says Oscar de la Renta , who rates the lime-green faille dress he created for Sarah Jessica Parker for last year 's New York City Ballet Spring Gala as one of his iconic pieces . " Women are wearing a lot of volume , and in my summer collection the short skirt draped at the front , shown with a T-shirt , has been a huge hit , " he says . " The thing about volume-you always have to worry that it will look cumbersome . It should look light . " De la Renta , with his training in haute couture , has two rules to prevent the look from getting out of control : The fabrics should stand on their own , and the silhouette should always be kept slender between waist and hips . So what are these fabrics that have the consistency of whipped egg whites-meaning they are soft but hold a shape ? Alber Elbaz , whose Lanvin collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine example of forgotten fabrics made new again : Faille , gazar and tulle , standing away from the body , have been resuscitated from the grand old days of haute couture . " It was Mr. Beene-everything I learned from him is coming back , " says Elbaz , referring to his mentor , Geoffrey Beene , who passed away last year . From that masterful training , Elbaz learned to create shapes in the light fabrics , but he has added a modern ease to them . " It 's not so much about volume ; it 's about freedom , " says Elbaz about his collection , in which tulip skirts have elastic waists , jackets are shaped with darts at the back , and pleats and tucks have a casual , unfinished look . " Control is part of modern life , " says Elbaz , explaining the need for ease while accepting that the waist is the most crucial and feminine part of a woman 's body . Narciso Rodriguez , famed for his hourglass , figure-hugging silhouettes , was one of the more surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was inspired by being at the beach and " watching all the kites and the kite surfers-the movement and the ease and the lightness . " Then his inspiration turned personal : He borrowed a tank top in Hawaii from a friend who is six feet five and weighs 240 pounds , and Rodriguez loved how carefree it felt . That was when he decided that comfort and ease should be the keynotes of his spring collection , although historically his silhouette has always been close to the body . " So for me , it was a great experiment to dress the woman I always dress in a new way , keeping the sexiness but doing something a little more relaxed and light , " Rodriguez says of his loose Empire-waist dresses . You 've tried that borrow-your-boyfriend 's tank top back home-and it does n't look so great . So inevitably , both the designer and the wearer must use a lot of discipline to stop the volume thing from getting out of hand . Perhaps the most obvious way to envisage the folds and drapes is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full , wrapped across the bosom with no buttons or fastening , the waist needs a clear definition , whether by a belt or perhaps a fabric sash . A chic skirt is egg-shaped , tapering toward the knees . What does n't work is a silhouette flapping loosely in several directions , giving the impression of an unmade bed . Rodriguez puts all that more gracefully . " For me , the new volume is about relaxing a bit but keeping the same sensuality , " he says . " If there 's something that 's quite tight , like a demibra over a full dress , you still have a real sense of a woman 's body . " Whereas male designers wax lyrical about the female body shape , Phoebe Philo , who spent most of last year coping with the spreading girth of her first pregnancy , which produced a baby girl in December , had a different take on volume in her easy , breezy Chlo collection . " What I do at Chlo is purely an expression of myself , but I take into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes of the spring season were driven by a desire for a sloppy , relaxed ease and fluidity that felt relevant and modern , " she says . " I know that sounds like a pregnant woman 's idea of heaven , but I have in fact found during my own pregnancy that the tighter and neater my silhouette-especially around the tummy-the sexier I felt . Otherwise , you risk looking like a beached whale ! " Philo is certainly onto something when she talks about making clothes that leave the woman in charge . She describes the Chlo style as carefree : " The silhouette and the cut are designed by a woman to fall where you want it to fall , " the designer says . " There is a sense of comfort and refinement that does not scream " fashion victim/ which allows the woman to feel like she is in control , that she is wearing the garment and it is not wearing her-although she knows she has got something precious on . For me , that subtlety is the sexiness . " Ah , sex ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corset and visible bra up front and dresses as short and tight as you dared , it is difficult to think of the body beautiful enveloped in folds of fabric . Sure , those drapes look great on nymphs and shepherdesses in some ancient pastoral , but how is that casual grace going to play on the subway or at work ? A wardrobe malfunction could put too much flesh on display , or the result could seem just plain messy . All the designers emphasize that volume in dressing is a question of proportion . Karl Lagerfeld , who did the rescaling thing last fall for Chanel Haute Couture but let it go for the ready-to-wear , admits that perfect proportions are easiest to handle when you 're designing one-of-a-kind , made-to-order outfits-in the finest fabrics , of course . His couture trick , which created an intelligent fashion formula , was to balance volume at the top half with a slender line below the waist and vice versa . For a summer wardrobe , that could mean pairing a full top with skinny pants or the time-honored combo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , loose dress can be worn over a slender underdress for an up-to-date version of the lingerie look . Nicolas Ghesquire had a different vision for Balenciaga-one that he calls " liquid volume . " Cristbal Balenciaga was the great master of fashion as weightless sculptures , with his egg-shaped silhouettes and flying-buttress backs that stood away from the body . Ghesquire says that although traditionally volumes have been important to the house , tastes change and it can be " a bit of an old story . " However , he revved up the past when he created a bell-shaped skirt as one of his first direct references to Balenciaga . " The challenge is how to make it modern , with a different construction of volumes , " Ghesquire says . " It was about volume in rigidity ; now it is more fluid . " In particular , the designer added fabric to softly draped pants that gave a new silhouette and proportion without taking away freedom of movement . Theorizing about fresh volumes may seem intriguing in the abstract , but how is it when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumpy profile , reflected in a shop window ? You are definitely going to need some reference point to the body you have worked so hard on in the gym . And the waist is the key . With fabric anchored firmly at your middle , the rest can go with the flow . As Rodriguez puts it : " I just feel like we need lightness , we need something a little bit more joyous , a little less aggressive , always going back to the curves of the body but with softness and volume . " " It 's not so much about volume ; its about freedom , " says Alber Elbaz " The new volume is about relaxing a bit but keeping the same sensuality , " says Narciso Rodriguez <p>
