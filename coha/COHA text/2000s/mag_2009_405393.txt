The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien NBC , weeknights , 11:35 p.m . ET/PT 4 stars THE NEW HOST ! COMEDY Admittedly , Conan O'Brien 's first few nights taking over from Jay Leno suggested it may take some time for him ( and viewers ) to adjust to the change in scale . Over the years he seems to have tailored himself into something as minimalist as a Pixar cartoon character -- white skin , long angles , that flame of hair shooting up -- and yet now he comes before us on a surprisingly sumptuous deco set . You do n't expect to see an up-to-the-minute comedian delivering his monologue before a pretty scrim of frosted blue glass . But O'Brien 's humor , ridiculous and genial , has survived the move from New York . It 's hard not to like a man who says the one star people in Hollywood mistake him for is Tilda Swinton . He also did a great bit about celebrities using Twitter and knocked guest Tom Hanks over with a fake meteor . As for the chortling amiability of Leno -- who , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't miss it . I 'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here ! NBC , Mondays -- Thursdays , 8 p.m . ET/PT 3 stars REALITY Launched with a cast that included American Idol 's Sanjaya Malakar and political wife Patti Blagojevich -- dust bunnies under fame 's bed -- Celebrity enjoyed a burst of buzz thanks to the obligingly loathsome Spencer and Heidi Pratt . Rather than suffer the indignities of competing Survivor-like in the jungles of Costa Rica , they threw an epic hissy fit , bolted -- then came back . This is n't a good show or a fresh one -- ABC aired a version in 2003 -- but I enjoy watching D-listers in the heat and dirt . It 's like a reality Apocalypse Now .

HORROR The first four episodes of the new season sustain the off-kilter appeal of HBO 's cult hit , which mixes supernatural gore , Deep South eccentricity -- and waitressing . The town of Bon Temps is seduced by strange , statuesque Maryann ( Michelle Forbes ) , who looks like a catalog model for clothes designed by Anne Rice . When she throws a party , the revelers turn into mindless orgiasts with solid-black eyes . Anna Paquin , as telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse , remains indispensable for supplying a note of down-to-earth empathy , even when having sex with her vampire boyfriend ( Stephen Moyer ) . Hawthorne TNT , June 16 , 9 p.m . ET/PT 2 stars NEW SERIES ! DRAMA Returning to TV , Jada Pinkett Smith plays Christina Hawthorne , head nurse at a hospital in Richmond , Va .

Yet Pinkett Smith ( who also executive-produced ) gives a quiet , sensitive performance . She 's attractively sympathetic .
