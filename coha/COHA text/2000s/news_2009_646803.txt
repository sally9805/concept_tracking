MILWAUKEE  --  Buzz Williams keeps dozens of books in his meticulously organized office at Marquette University . The men 's basketball coach has autobiographies written by famous coaches , New York Times best sellers and his own detailed journal with color-coded entries . <p> The office is a tidy sanctuary . Papers are carefully stacked on Williams desk ; even the remote for his plasma television must be placed just right . Williams says he has obsessive-compulsive habits . <p> " Those papers have to be perfectly in order , " he says . " If somebody comes in my office and changes things , it flips me out . " <p> In his first season as Marquette 's head coach , Williams , 36 , is running a well-oiled machine . Behind fourth-year starting guards Dominic James , Jerel McNeal and Wesley Matthews , the 10th-ranked Golden Eagles ( 23-4 , 12-2 ) are contenders for the Big East Conference title going into a home game tonight against No. 2 Connecticut ( 25-2 , 13-2 ) , which shares the league lead with Louisville . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 180-degree turn from the chaotic setting Williams faced in 2006 , when he became head coach at the University of New Orleans amid the school 's rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina . <p> He declines to discuss his frustrating times at UNO , but Williams lawsuit against the school over a $300,000 buyout clause paints grim conditions during UNO 's long recovery from Katrina . <p> " I do n't really need to say anything about it , " he says . " It ai n't hard to figure out . It was a mess . " <p> Williams won 14 games and left in July 2007 after one season , essentially taking a demotion to become an assistant at Marquette . He says he heard he was committing " career suicide " for bolting . <p> " I just like to work , " he says . " I 've never been caught up in what my title was . " <p> When Crean accepted the Indiana job last April , Williams was prepared to go with him until Marquette 's administration picked him as Crean 's replacement . Williams bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we were also looking for the long-term benefit of our program and what would suit us best , " Marquette athletics director Steve Cottingham says . <p> Williams abbreviated stint at UNO was n't a concern , Cottingham says . " We understood the circumstances . " <p> Williams says he counts his blessings for landing a second head coaching job less than a year after leaving his first . The upper Midwest was new territory for Williams . He grew up in Texas , attended Oklahoma City University and worked at schools in Texas , Colorado and Louisiana . Those ties have been an asset . He recruited players from Pennsylvania to Texas last fall . <p> " You got your first Division I ( head coaching ) job at 33 , and then you left to come to part of the country you know nothing about , " he says , recounting his journey to Marquette . " And then nine months later you 're named the head coach . How can you explain all that ? You ca n't explain it . It was by God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savvy play and enviable chemistry shared by James , McNeal and Matthews have been vital in Williams transition . <p> The players experience practically makes them assistant coaches on the floor . McNeal is reading books by former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy and New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin with hopes of one day coaching . He is writing a paper on coaching for an independent study class . <p> " They have protected me in a lot of situations , " Williams says . " They make plays you ca n't coach . They see things you ca n't tell players to see . That 's a priceless value . " <p> Yet the players say Williams motion offense has been a major reason for their improvement . It has given them freedom and confidence to create their own shots . " He made our jobs easier by putting us in positions where we can be our best , " Matthews says . " The game is coming easier to us . We 're thanking Buzz . " <p> The numbers speak for themselves . McNeal is third in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has scored a school-record 1,831 career points . <p> Matthews is the Big East 's fourth-leading scorer at 18.7 points , and James averages 11.7 points and 5.3 assists , third-best in the league . Also , junior forward Lazar Hayward has emerged with averages of 16 points and 8.6 rebounds . <p> Williams won their trust , in part , with his coaching strategies but more with talks and off-court assignments that had little , if anything , to do with basketball . <p> " Everything we did in the summer was beneficial for developing a relationship on trust , " Williams says . <p> He had all the players read The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch , with Jeffrey Zaslow , in which the author inspired readers to embrace life as he coped with terminal cancer . The players had to write and share book reports . " It was kind of life-changing , " James says . " We were like , ' Coach , we already have enough work for school . But getting that in-depth analysis from teammates and their perspective on life ... you learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ways to connect with his players , says Lewis Orr , who gave Williams his first coaching job at Navarro College in Texas in 1990 . Williams , whose first name is Brent , was nicknamed Buzz by Orr . " He was always buzzing around , full of energy and ideas and moving faster than I could even see , " says Orr , now a consultant for the Marquette team . <p> A few weeks ago Williams and his players connected by going out to eat . Williams went without his assistants and drove a small shuttle bus . On the way , he played a homemade CD featuring some of his players favorite songs . The players sang and danced to Michael Jackson 's Rock With You for freshman reserve Chris Otule , a huge Jackson fan . <p> " I could n't get them out of the bus because of the music , " Williams wrote in his journal that night . " It was the best idea I 've had thus far .

" The lawsuit claims that players did n't receive meal money on time , proper academic support was lacking , and coaches were n't reimbursed for expenses on recruiting trips . <p> UNO is fighting the charges . " He claims he was misled about the situation , " says Patricia Adams , the school 's general counsel . " We disagree with that vehemently . Instead of honoring his contract , he chose to make these ludicrous allegations . " <p> Williams New Orleans-based attorney , Henry A. King , says he does n't expect a trial date to be set before next year . <p> Williams was the second men 's basketball coach to leave UNO in Katrina 's wake . Coach Monte Towe left in 2006 to become associate head coach at North Carolina State , his alma mater . UNO athletics director Jim Miller says the university released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of his buyout and N.C. State agreed to schedule a series of games against UNO . <p> Williams keeps reminders of his UNO experience in his office . He has a graduation photo of a former UNO player and has a file on every game stored neatly in his desk drawer . <p> He keeps copious notes on books he reads , conversations he has with players parents and input he gets from assistants . Williams keeps some folded and clipped together in his pocket . <p> His journal is a mixture of play charts , observations and reflections , all printed in upper-case letters . The remarks are made with different ink colors , his own organized coding scheme . <p> " Organized  --  that 's an understatement , " Orr says . " He is meticulous and has an innate ability to observe in great depth .
