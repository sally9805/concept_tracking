Sleep is the new sex . That 's what it 's come down to for the heroine of Allison Pearson 's I Do n't Know How She Does It ( Knopf ; 338 pages ) . A hedge-fund manager and frazzled mother of two , Kate Reddy aches for sleep , fantasizes about it and contrives how to get more , largely by avoiding sex with her husband . <P> Nearly every female lucky enough to have both a child and a byline  --  and I plead guilty  --  has strip-mined Pearson 's theme : how to squeeze babies , marriage and a high-powered job into a day that can not be stretched beyond 24 hours . But Pearson 's Kate , a brisk , sardonic , loving world beater , has made it all fresh again . <P> The book 's title , when uttered by a member of the Muffia  --  the nonworking mums  --  is not a compliment . They send thank-you notes for play dates , needle Kate about when she will go part time and snap up the best party clowns , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs . Kate sees both sides of the mother divide : " The non-working mother looks at the working mother with envy and fear because she thinks that the working mum has got away with it , and the working mum looks back with fear and envy because she knows that she has not . " <P> Pearson , a star columnist at the London Evening Standard , makes Kate one of those superwomen who think they would like a wife . But when Kate 's husband Rich , a low-energy architect , picks up the household slack , she loses interest in him . She is hard-wired to want a hunter-gatherer and nearly has an affair with one , an alpha millionaire client . But she cheats on her boss instead , stealing " Illicit Mummy Time , " which requires " the same lies to get away for the tryst , the same burst of fulfillment and , of course , the guilt . " <P> Kate adores Jill , a stay-at-home mom dying of cancer , who poignantly captures family life in instructions she leaves for her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next two years , advice to kiss the boys even when they grow tall ) . Unlike Jill , though , Kate is a bit player in her own household , which is run by a nanny wielding absolute power . Kate does n't know her daughter 's best friend or how much her son weighs . She 's a victim of reverse intimacy ; her associates soak up so much time that she stays in touch with her real friends through increasingly heartfelt messages in which she cancels plans yet again . Like many professionals who leap a social class , she wonders  --  when her child demands pasta instead of canned SpaghettiOs  --  if " I 've traveled this far ... only for my kids to grow up as jaded and spoiled as the people I was patronized by at college .
