The white Lexus was doing exactly one mile over the speed limit when it crossed the Louisiana state line . <p> It had started to rain just outside of Jackson , Mississippi-a steady downpour the wipers simply could n't keep up with . Visibility was impaired enough to force Sue to slow down to a crawl as she passed through the city . <p> Sue 's shoulders tensed as she watched the red taillights of the Jeep Cherokee in front of her . She had been driving almost nonstop for nearly two days now . The other girls on campus had been thinking about their exams , about what they 'd do on their upcoming holiday breaks . But Sue 's mind had been on one thing and one thing only . Getting away . There had been no other choice . <p> She snapped on the radio , trying to relieve the tedium of the drive and the steady , pounding rain . " Have yourself a merry little Christmas , " a voice sang from the radio . " Let your heart be light ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel that way to Sue , with the warm , muggy rain . <p> " From now on , our troubles will be out of sight ... " <p> She was crying . She switched off the radio . She preferred the silence . <p> Sue glanced back in her rearview mirror . She was n't really sure who-or what-she was looking for . In the rain , she could n't see anything but headlights anyway . But somehow it made her feel better to look back every now and then . Her nerves , already shot , began to fray a little as she kept taking her foot off the gas pedal to avoid slamming into the car in front of her . <p> " Come on , come on , " Sue muttered under her breath , drumming her fingers on the steering wheel . The wind and rain whipped against the side of the car with a long , screeching howl . <p> It seemed to take hours to get through Jackson , but once she did , the thick traffic began to disperse . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as she clocked seventy-one , she clicked on the cruise control and removed her foot from the gas pedal with a sigh of relief . Her right hip was getting sore , and she shifted a little in her seat . Cars and trucks flew past her in the left lane , throwing up streams of water onto her windshield . No matter how tempting it was to speed up , she resisted the urge and kept relying on the cruise control . She could n't risk being pulled over . <p> It was just paranoia , she knew . Surely , there was no rural Southern sheriff watching for her . In all likelihood , there was n't anyone at all on the road looking for her . But better safe than sorry . <p> I just do n't know , Sue reminded herself , and until I do know , it 's better not to take any risks-and not to trust anyone . If I try to tell anyone-they 'll just think I 'm crazy , and they 'll turn me over to Gran and Granpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose in her throat , but Sue fought it down . Do n't cry again , that 's a waste of energy . I have to focus . I have to keep my mind clear and not give in to emotion . I 'm almost there . It 's only a few more hours at most , and then I can take a break , get some rest , and maybe find some hope ... <p> But for how long could she afford to rest ? Sooner or later , she knew , they 'd come for her . They would n't just let her get away . <p> She still had over five hundred dollars in cash in her purse , but there was no telling how long that would last . She was afraid to use her credit cards and her debit card . She 'd paid cash at that horrible cheap motel just outside of Richmond , Virginia , where she 'd grabbed a few hours of desperately needed sleep before hitting the road again . She could n't leave any electronic traces behind-that would make it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cell phone back at her dorm room in upstate New York , buying a cheap disposable pay-as-you-go one at a Wal-Mart somewhere in northern Pennsylvania as she headed south . She 'd worried about her license plates , wondering if there was a bulletin sent out with a description of her and her car-but if it came down to it , there was the gun in the compartment between the seats . She was n't sure if she would actually have the nerve to use it , but it was there in case she needed it . <p> I hope I do n't have to use it , she thought , glancing down at the armrest where it was hidden . But she would if she had to . <p> The highway was wet and the rhythmic sound of the water being thrown up by the wheels against the car made her even sleepier . She was exhausted . It had been almost sixteen hours since she checked out of that miserable motel and hit the road . Outside of stopping for gas and a quick run to the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff . She could feel knots of tension in her back , and her left elbow was sore from resting on the car door . Her eyes burned with fatigue , her throat was dry , her lips chapped . She 'd kept the window cracked , hoping the rush of cold air from outside would keep her awake . She glanced at her watch . It was almost two . <p> It ca n't be much further , she reasoned . On the map Hammond looks like it 's almost in Mississippi . She glanced at herself in the rearview mirror and grimaced . Worse than how she looked , she could smell herself and it was n't pleasant-she smelled like sour socks . Her feet were sweating in her shoes . And now her stomach was growling . She had n't eaten since seven in the morning , when she 'd stopped at a Hardee 's somewhere in north Alabama . She 'd managed to choke down some sort of fried egg on a dry biscuit , washing it down with numerous cups of coffee . All she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and go to sleep right there . But she 'd forced herself to get a refill to go , and kept driving . <p> Got to keep going , Sue told herself , repeating the litany like a catechism . Do n't know when they might come after me , do n't know how much time I have , got to get there before they figure out where I 've gone , got to get there while it 's still safe-if it ever was safe there in the first place . <p> She allowed herself to smile when she saw the big sign with the fleur-de-lis in the center , reading WELCOME TO LOUISIANA and BIENVENUE EN LOUISIANE underneath . She thought about stopping at the welcome area , but there were too many cars and trucks parked all around , and a quick glance down at her gas gauge , inching ever closer to the red , convinced her to keep going . She decided to take the next exit with a gas station , fill up the tank , use the restroom , and get something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach rebelled at the thought of more coffee-especially gas station coffee . Maybe a soda , she thought . I 'm almost there , it ca n't be more than another hour , maybe I can make myself stay awake till I get there without more coffee . <p> After crossing the state line , she took the next exit , pulling into a deserted Texaco station . It was a typical roadside gas station , two islands with numbered pumps , a little food store for snacks , and restrooms . Through the rain she could discern Christmas lights strung along the outside of the building , blinking red and green and yellow . Signs all over the glass front announced sales on beer , soda , and the availability of Louisiana lottery tickets . The jackpot for the next drawing was fifty-three million dollars . <p> A lot of good that would do me , Sue thought . <p> She noticed off to the side of the station a battered-looking Toyota was parked , with bumper stickers plastered all over the trunk and rear bumper : YOUR MOTHER WAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEVE . JESUS DIED FOR YOUR SINS . SUPPORT THE TROOPS . A metal fish symbol was affixed to the lower trunk close to the bumper and next to the license plate , just below a huge yellow ribbon . <p> She felt an inexplicable surge of panic . <p> Get out of here , get back on the highway , stop at the next station , there 's got to be a better place than this , raced through her head before she got a hold of herself again . I need gas , and I have to go to the bathroom . <p> Just be goddamned careful , that 's all . <p> Sue pulled to a stop at the pump closest to the store entrance and stepped out of the car , shivering against the chill in the air . The rain was letting up . She stretched-she had n't been out of the car in over four hours since stopping at a rest area-and her knees and back popped in places . It felt good to stand up . She bent over to stretch her back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She walked over to the door and pushed it open , greeted by the high-pitched wail of a Christmas carol- Rockin ' around the Christmas tree , have a hap-pee holiday - and a blast of hot air . Sue smiled at the girl behind the counter and headed for the bathroom . Once inside , she locked the door . The bathroom smelled vaguely like pine . It was relatively clean-she 'd used worse on this trip-but she wiped down the seat anyway before dropping her jeans . She let her head rest on her hands . Almost there , she reminded herself as her eyes began to droop . <p> Washing her hands , she ran the sink water until it was hot , then splashed it into her face . She grabbed her brush out of her purse and ran it through her blond hair . What a mess , she thought , grimacing at her reflection . Whatever happened to that pretty college freshman ? <p> She never really existed , Sue thought with a terrible sensation in her chest . <p> When her hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into her purse and looked again at herself in the mirror . That 's better . Not pretty , but at least presentable . Her hair needed to be washed-a shower would be heaven-but she dried her face and walked out of the bathroom . <p> At the counter , a fresh pot of coffee was almost finished brewing . The coffee in the other pots looked like mud , scorched by hours on their burners . Her stomach growled again . A glass case full of doughnuts next to the coffee stand enticed her . She opened the case and picked up two glazed doughnuts , slipping one into a bag and taking a bite out of the other as she waited for the pot to stop brewing . She finished the rest of the doughnut , dropping a third into the bag , and poured herself a large cup of the fresh coffee . After adding creamer and sweetener , she took a sip . Not bad for gas station coffee , she thought . <p> The girl working behind the counter was about Sue 's age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give or take . A home perm had frizzed her mousy brown hair around her head . She looked as if she 'd received an intense electrical shock . Her cheeks were thick , narrowing her brown eyes until they were almost invisible . Acne scars pitted both cheeks . Her lips were thin and painted orange . Her plump arms were freckled where they extended out from her blue smock , and on the upper left arm in blue script the name Jason was tattooed . The smock was open , revealing a black T-shirt with A Touch of Class silk-screened in gold over her breasts . A charm bracelet jangled as she punched numbers into the register . On her heavy left breast a name tag read MYRNA LEE . <p> " New York plates , " Myrna Lee said , gesturing with her head out the window . " You 're a long way from home . " Her voice was high-pitched and her accent thick . " Do n't see many of those around here . " <p> Sue offered the clerk a small smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Act normal , like anyone else . That 's the most important thing . Do n't act funny in any way . <p> The register beeped as Myrna Lee typed that in . " Twenty-three forty-seven . " The clerk grimaced , her lips pulling back to expose crooked yellow teeth . " Where ya heading , so far away from home ? " <p> She 's just making conversation to be polite . Or-she could be one of them ... <p> A chill went down her spine . " Los Angeles , " she lied , handing over a twenty and a ten , trying to keep her hand from shaking . " Going to go live with my boyfriend . " <p> Myrna Lee took her money , but kept her beady eyes fixed on her face . <p> " How far is the next town , or where I can get something to eat ? " she asked the clerk , who finally averted her eyes . She felt could feel her heart pounding . <p> " We-ell , let me think . " Myrna Lee put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's Amite , Shiloh , Independence , then Tickfaw , and then Hammond . I reckon it depends on how hungry you are . There are more choices in Hammond , I 'd imagine . College town . " <p> " And how far is that ? " Do n't act too interested in Hammond . Even if she is n't one of them , they could always ask her , and you do n't want to give too much away . <p> " Twenty , thirty minutes maybe . It ai n't far . " <p> " And New Orleans ? " <p> " New Orleans ? ' Bout another hour past Hammond . " Myrna Lee grimaced again . " It ai n't the same since the hurricane , though . You just keep taking 55 past Hammond , and then you go east on I-10 . You pick it up out in the swamp . I-10 'll take you right to New Orleans . " <p> " Thanks . " <p> " Do n't mention it . You have a happy Christmas now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doughnuts and coffee and walked back out to the car . Hooking the nozzle into the tank and setting the latch so she did n't have to hold it , she wolfed down the doughnuts . Then she took another long sip of the coffee . When the gas tank clicked that she was full , she replaced the nozzle back onto the pump and climbed back into the car . <p> She sat there for a few moments after starting the ignition . It was still raining , and an eighteen-wheeler flew past on I-55 , throwing up a huge spray of water . <p> " Almost there , " she said out loud , and then felt panic starting to creep into her brain . <p> What if this was all for nothing ? What if there 's nothing she can do to help me ? What if she 's not even there ? What if there 's nothing anyone can do to help me ? I do n't even know why I 'm going to see Dr. Marshall-but she is an expert , and the girl said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be a fool 's errand , the delusions of a crazy girl , a crazy girl who claims she- <p> " Stop it , " Sue said , pounding the steering wheel with both hands . " This is n't going to help . " <p> Her eyes filled with tears . Sue sat there for a full minute and let the panic sweep over her . Her body began to tremble , and she put her head down on the steering wheel and let the tears come . After a few moments , she took a deep breath and regained control of herself . " Okay , that 's enough of that , " she said aloud . <p> She glanced out the window . Myrna Lee had come outside and was staring at her , smoking a cigarette . Sue wiped at her face , smiled , and gave Myrna Lee a friendly wave , even though fear was starting to inch its insidious way back into her mind . So much for acting normal , she thought grimly as she slipped the car into gear and rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some distance between me and this place . <p> There was no traffic coming , so she sped up as she headed back onto the highway . The eighteen-wheeler was just taillights in the mist far ahead of her . She got the car back up to seventy-one miles an hour and turned the cruise control back on , then allowed herself to relax a little bit . But within a few miles , she was back to glancing in the rearview mirror every minute or so to make sure no one was behind her . <p> I 'm being stupid , Sue reminded herself again . Even if they are coming after me , how would I know it was them behind me ? I would n't know until it was too late , until they had me- <p> " Stop it , " she said , and turned the radio up louder . <p> Angels we have heard on high , sweetly singing o'er the plain ... <p> She wished so much she had managed to grab her iPod , or at least a handful of CDs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body ached with fatigue . Sue 's eyelids began drooping again . The coffee had n't helped at all , other than to churn up more acid in her stomach . She grabbed the pack of Rolaids she 'd bought a hundred years ago , it seemed , in North Carolina and chewed on two . Rolling the window all the way down in spite of the rain , she took a long deep breath of cold air . Her hair blew back into a mass of tangles and her teeth began to chatter , but it was better than falling asleep again . <p> She flew past the exits for Amite , Tickfaw , and Independence , glancing down at the directions she 'd printed off the Internet just before taking off on this nightmare drive . The first Hammond exit was n't the right one , so she kept going . The traffic was getting heavier , but it was the second turnoff she wanted . She slowed down at the bottom of the off-ramp and turned left , heading into Hammond . She passed a Lowe 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered in small towns near the highway exit . Her stomach growled again and she thought about going to a drive-through , but dismissed the thought as quickly as it came . I 'm almost there . I can worry about getting something to eat after I 've gotten out of this goddamned car and talked to Dr. Marshall . ( Continues ... ) <p>
