It 's tough to know how much artery-damaging trans fat you 're really eating . Here 's how to spot it . // You 're a health-conscious person , so you decide to start your day with a nutritious bowl of General Mills Basic 4 cereal . And why not ? A serving ( 55 grams , or about 1 cup ) contains 200 calories , just 3 grams of total fat and O grams of saturated fat . Photograph Many of our favorite treats are made with heart-damaging trans fats . // But before you open the box , think about this : The label does n't say so , but of the 3 grams of total fat per serving , 1 gram is trans fat , a particularly insidious type of artery-clogging fat . " Trans fats often double the trouble that foods cause to your heart , " says Margo Wootan , Sc.D. , nutrition policy director of the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) in Washington , D.C , which has spent more than a decade lobbying the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantities of trans fats there are in food . " Some foods have as much trans fat as saturated fat . " Starting in January 2006 , CSPI will get its wish . That 's when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) will require food labels to include trans-fat information . Then the public is likely to begin to fully grasp what consumer health advocates have known for years : There 's a dangerous amount of trans fats hidden in many of our favorite prepared and processed foods . How much is too much ? Hidden trans fats would n't be such a big deal , nutrition experts say , if they were n't so damaging to your cardiovascular system . Like saturated fat , trans fats increase LDL cholesterol ( the " bad " kind ) , escalating the risk of heart attacks and strokes . But trans fats may do even more damage : Some research suggests that they also lower levels of HDL cholesterol , the type that helps keep arteries clean . " They essentially stick in your arteries more than other types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Severson , co-author of The Trans Fat Solution ( Ten Speed Press , 2003 ) , a guide to shopping and cooking without trans fats . Several studies , including the ongoing Nurses ' Health Study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health , have found strong evidence that trans-fat consumption substantially increases the risk of coronary heart disease . For example , the Nurses ' Health Study noted that replacing just 2 percent of calories from trans fats with calories from unsaturated fats was associated with an astonishing 53 percent lower risk of the disease . So how much trans fat is too much ? That 's unknown . Even small increases in trans-fat consumption appear to elevate heart-disease risk , and there is no known safe limit . To date , the PDA has not issued a recommended " daily value " for trans fats , as it has for other nutrients . For its part , the agency simply recommends that trans-fat consumption be kept " as low as possible . " That 's why it 's important to pay attention to even a small amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams there can add up , " Wootan notes . According to FDA regulations , once trans fats do appear on labels , manufacturers will be able to round down their trans-fat totals if products have less than 0.5 gram . So foods with less than 0.5 gram per serving will be able to claim they are trans-fat-free . Photograph Most crispy snacks are loaded with trans fats . // A modern fat Although trans fats are found in small amounts naturally ( primarily in some animal-based foods ) , almost all of what we get in our daily diets are manufactured . They 're created when food makers add hydrogen to vegetable oil , a process called hydrogenation , which turns liguid oils into stable , long-lasting solids , such as shortening and many stick margarines . If you see " partially hydrogenated vegetable oil " on an ingredient list , you know the food contains trans fats . The food industry loves these fats : They 're a cheap , effective way to make crackers crunchy , trench fries crispy , cookie fillings creamy and frozen foods more flavorful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's not just fried foods , processed baked goods and bread spreads that harbor trans fats . Laboratory testing by CSPI and other consumer organizations has also detected the fats in places you might not expect : Breakfast cereals , microwave popcorn , frozen waffles , packaged pudding snacks - all contain partially hydrogenated oils , albeit in smaller amounts than a bucket of fried chicken . Even lowfat foods such as Kellogg 's Low Fat Granola are n't trans-fat-free . " It 's truly a stealth fat it 's everywhere , " Severson says , noting that some seemingly healthful foods like peanut butter , breakfast bars , flour tortillas , bean dips and even baby foods contain trans fats . Setting a limit Though it 's important to pay attention to your trans-fat intake , Wootan says , " you should n't avoid every single gram of trans fats at the expense of raising your saturated fat intake . People are eating about five times more saturated fat than trans fats , so it 's important to look at both . " Americans typically get about 54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from trans fats - slightly less than 6 grams . ( One gram of fat - trans fats included - contains 9 calories , 5 more than a gram of protein or carbohydrate . ) But when you add that to our average daily saturated-fat intake of about 24-30 grams , it 's no wonder heart disease is the country 's No. 1 cause of death . Experts recommend restricting that artery-clogging combination of fats to less than 10 percent of total daily calories , or about 20-22 grams on an 1,800- to 2,000-calorie diet ( 20-22 grams have 180-198 calories ) . For many , that 's a tall order . " You can get a whole day 's worth of trans and saturated fats in a single sitting , " Wootan cautions . Order a Burger King Whopper with cheese , a medium chocolate shake and medium french fries and you 've just consumed a whopping 40 grams of saturated and trans fats - two days ' worth ! The french fries contain the most trans fats , 4.5 grams ( in addition to 5 grams of saturated fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saturated fat , 18 grams. // But even if you never set foot in a fast-food joint , you can still inadvertently run up your trans-fat numbers . A bowl of Kellogg 's Cracklin ' Oat Bran cereal ( 1.5 grams of trans fats plus 2 grams of saturated fat ) with 1 percent milk ( 1.5 grams saturated fat ) for breakfast plus a Jell-0 Pudding Snack ( 1.5 grams of trans fats plus 1.5 grams of saturated fat ) uses up 40 percent of a day 's allotment of trans fats and saturated fats combined . Consumer-health advocates are hoping that once trans-fat numbers start appearing on labels , the food industry will be forced to reformulate their products , a process that is neither easy nor cheap . But in fact , changes are already happening : FritoLay removed the trans fats from its chips ; Unilever Bestfoods has marketed a trans-fat-free line of Promise soft spread ( tub ) margarines ; and seven of the eight varieties of Triscuit Baked Whole Grain Wheat Crackers ( except Cheddar ) contain no trans fats . Supermarkets such as Whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with snacks and baked goods that contain no partially hydrogenated vegetable oils . It may be a long while before transfat-free foods go mainstream , though . Still , with the upcoming labeling laws , Wootan says , " at least people will finally know just how much heartdamaging fat is in their foods .

Sidebar Trans fats may damage your even more than saturated fat does , because they also lower " good " cholesterol . Sidebar how to spot traris Trans fats wo n't appear on food labels until January 2006 , so until then you 'll have to do a bit of sleuthing at the supermarket . Here are some tips for detecting and avoiding these unhealthy fats . * Scrutinize the ingredient list . Read the words partially hydrogenated as frans fafs . The higher these words appear on the ingredient list , the more trans fats the product has . * Watch your portions . When you 're deciding whether or not the product has too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are likely to eat , advises San Francisco Chronicle food writer Kim Severson . A cup of light microwave popcorn contains only 20 calories , with just 5 calories from fat . But few of us eat only 1 cup of this treat at a sitting . * When you eat out , ask . Restaurants are n't required to provide nutrition information unless they make nutritional claims such as " lowfat " or " low-sodium . " So ask whether a dish is made with liquid oil , such as canola or safflower oil . If it 's not , pass . Also , many fast-food and chain restaurants will provide nutrition information on request .

Sidebar " Once trans fats are on the label , people will be able to see that despite containing trans fats - a lower-fat tub margarine has less heart-damaging fat than butter , " says Margo Wootan , Sc.D. , a nutritionist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington , D.C. " just look at the combined total of saturated fat and trans fats to make your choice . " Check out the chart below comparing 1-tablespoon servings of various spreads . The healthiest pick : tub margarine , with 4.3 fewer grams of total " bad fat " than butter and 0.8 fewer than stick margarine .
