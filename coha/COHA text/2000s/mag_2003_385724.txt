<p> <p> NEWS ITEM : " Washington governor Gary Locke 's trip to China bore its first fruit Monday with news that a Kent-based printing-press maker signed a contract worth $11 million a year with the People 's Daily newspaper , the Communist Party organ . " Hmm ... well , the People 's Daily might be to the right of the Seattle papers . <p> <p> Bill Clinton , settling further into his role as Second-Guesser-in-Chief , said that he warned incoming President Bush about the threat from Osama bin Laden . If Clinton actually did this , it was helpful , although not nearly as helpful as taking serious action against bin Laden 's network during his time in office would have been . In early 2001 , Bush faced a grave terrorist threat that had become steadily graver because of what the Clinton administration had done and left undone during the 1990s  --  the CIA had been prevented from recruiting overseas agents , the FBI had been further hamstrung , immigration policy had been loosened , airport security had remained lax , and bin Laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Afghanistan . If he had really been trying to help , Bill Clinton would have given Bush another warning : " I 've left the nation in great danger . " <p> <p> Funny how quickly Wesley Clark changes his mind . On January 22 , 2002 , addressing an audience at Harding University in Searcy , Ark. , Clark had the following to say : " I tremendously admire , and I think we all should , the great work done by our commander in chief , our president , George Bush . " A little more than eight months earlier , speaking in Little Rock , he was even more effusive : " President George Bush had the courage and the vision ... and we will always be grateful to President George Bush for that tremendous leadership and statesmanship . " Would this be the same President Bush whom Clark now presents as unfit ? Clark is , of course , entitled to revise his opinions . Both Bush-praising speeches pre-date the Iraq intervention , and perhaps Clark 's view of the president has dimmed  --  genuinely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of criticism that Clark can reasonably raise against Bush , and make it appropriate to ask whether Clark is a man of principle or a mere opportunist . <p> <p> It has become fashionable in certain quarters to blame President Bush for causing a kind of fiscal Armageddon with his tax cuts and his defense-spending increases . So it was refreshing to hear Sen. John McCain , appearing on a recent edition of Meet the Press , say , " I think the elephant in the room is Medicare and Social Security , and the first baby boomer is going to retire in 2010 . " In the same program , McCain argued for spending what is needed to strengthen America 's armed forces and stabilize Iraq . Here are priorities as they should be : Before all else , government must defend against foreign threat . Entitlement programs are comparatively a luxury , and now , during wartime , it is more appropriate than ever to seek their reform . Regrettably , Senator McCain also lapsed into clichs about the need for Bush to veto " terrible pork-barrel-spending bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful , as pork accounts for a tiny portion of overall spending . On the whole , however , Senator McCain acquitted himself admirably . <p> <p> Perhaps the Bush administration should just admit the error of its ways and turn over Iraqi reconstruction to Rep. Henry Waxman . Come to think of it , that is precisely what Waxman is proposing . For months now , the California Democrat has accused the administration of cronyism and , possibly , corruption in the decision to award some Iraq contracts to Halliburton , the giant services company that used to be run by Vice President Dick Cheney . Now , Waxman has transformed his anti-administration crusade into legislation , the " Clean Contracting in Iraq Act . " The bill would essentially throw out the government 's contracting practices when it comes to Iraq and would in effect make Henry Waxman a part of the contracting process . Waxman 's proposal would require the executive branch to notify the chairman or the ranking member of relevant congressional committees  --  that would be Waxman on the House Government Reform Committee  --  of contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it would require the administration to quickly hand over unredacted copies of all documents involved in the contracts upon the request of ... Henry Waxman . It should be remembered that Waxman has not found any evidence of any improper conduct on the administration 's or on Halliburton 's part . There is , in fact , good reason to think that Halliburton is the best company for the job and got the contracts by standard and accepted contracting practices ( see Byron York 's " All Smoke , No Fire , " NR , July 14 , 2003 ) . Of course , that 's never stopped Waxman before . <p> <p> In 1991 , Texas Democrats gerrymandered the state 's congressional districts without shame or hesitation . In 2001 , it was time to redraw the district lines . The legislature failed to do so , and a court stepped in with new lines that left the map mostly the same . As a result , Democrats hold 53 percent of the state 's congressional seats even though Republican candidates won 56 percent of the vote last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own . This looks like the normal political tug-of-war to us , but parts of the national press  --  the Washington Post , the New York Times , The New Republic  --  have been comically indignant . The line is that there is a time-honored tradition that redistricting happens only once a decade . Fair enough . But there is also a time-honored tradition that the state legislature , and not the courts , does the job . It may suit liberals ' definition of democracy for one of the most Republican states in the nation to send a Democratic delegation to Congress year after year . Nobody else should be upset by the Texas Republicans ' handiwork . <p> <p> In 1996 , California voters amended the state constitution to ban racial preferences . When the issue came before the state supreme court , the justices unanimously found that the amendment had banned racial preferences . One of those justices , Janice Brown , has now been nominated to a federal appeals-court judgeship by President Bush . The Democrats are attacking her for her decision in the preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black herself , to Clarence Thomas  --  and they do n't mean that as a good thing . Brown has a justified reputation for following the law rather than rewriting it from the bench . When she ran for reelection , that reputation earned her the endorsement of the liberal San Francisco Chronicle . If the Democrats continue to block her , they will be saying that racial preferences come before the will of the voters , impartial judging , and the rule of law . <p> <p> The Supreme Court is in a sticky situation as it takes up the Pledge of Allegiance . The Ninth Circuit ruled last year that , since the pledge includes the words " under God , " asking schoolchildren to recite it would amount to an unconstitutional " establishment of religion . " That verdict strikes most people , and most politicians , as secularist extremism . Yet the ruling is plausibly based on the Supreme Court 's own doctrines of recent decades . To reconsider those doctrines , and move back toward the actual Constitution as ratified , is probably not on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Court were to strike down the pledge , it would doubtless spark a public backlash that it does not want . So it will probably find some way , however contrived , to distinguish the instant case from its previous cases , or simply rule that the plaintiff lacks standing to sue . Let the Court find its way through this puzzle . There is no reason for the rest of the nation to wait meekly as it does so . The Ninth Circuit 's decision is a case study in the dangers of going along with the federal courts ' claims to exclusive ownership of the Constitution . Congress should enact the bill , sponsored by Rep. Todd Akin and Sen. Orrin Hatch , to remove the pledge from the courts ' jurisdiction . The Supreme Court , whatever its inclinations , should not have the power to strike the words " under God . " <p> <p> The Court let stand a lower-court ruling that enjoins the federal government from punishing doctors who recommend marijuana to their patients . " I can do my job again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who first filed the case ( marijuana can help relieve symptoms of AIDS and chemotherapy ) . California law says the state will not prosecute patients who obtain marijuana with a doctor 's recommendation . Now doctors may legally give such recommendations , though federal law still prohibits growing , supplying , possessing , or using the drug . Well , one step at a time . <p> <p> Lots of women , either for simple cosmetic reasons or as part of reconstructive surgery following mastectomies , want to have silicone breast implants . Eleven years ago , the Food and Drug Administration , under the notorious David Kessler , imposed a moratorium on the sale of these implants . Kessler was reacting to a fact-free campaign of media hysteria about the health risks of these implants . There followed a looting expedition by the trial lawyers , leading at last to a $3.2 billion settlement against the implant manufacturers . Now an FDA advisory panel has recommended that the Kessler ban be lifted , since nobody has been able to find any evidence that silicone breast implants are any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur were , the panel found , no more frequent or malign than those associated with saline-filled implants , which have never been banned . The FDA rarely fails to act on recommendations from its advisory panels , so the implants should be available again soon . Too late , alas , for the women who have been denied implants this eleven years past ; and too late for the employees and shareholders of those manufacturers forced into bankruptcy by the trial lawyers . A triumph of reason over junk science , nonetheless . <p> <p> During the Korean War , Douglas MacArthur wanted to attack Manchuria , and he let that be known to everyone who would listen . That was not U.S. policy , however , and President Truman promptly sacked the great man . During the Cold War  --  in fact often pretty hot  --  NATO general Edwin Walker was instructing his troops in the theorems of the John Birch Society . That the U.S. government was 60 percent under Communist control was not the view of the Kennedy administration , and Walker was gone . Flash forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boykin , has been lecturing , in public and in uniform , to the effect that we are in a war with Islam , than whose god his God is bigger , that this is a war against Satan , of whom he has a photograph in the sky above Mogadishu . President Bush has made it national policy that we are not in a war with global Islam . Furthermore , it is hardly good for the morale of troops to understand that their commander is a wacko who goes around photographing Satan zooming overhead . General Boykin is manifestly insubordinate , and should be sacked . Yesterday . <p> <p> There are some bad ideas whose time simply comes , and they become unstoppable . New York City  --  once known as Babylon on the Hudson , the libertarian Sodom , the place where a couple of C-notes could buy you anything , my friend , step this way  --  banned smoking in its bars and restaurants . Now politically correct Ireland is following suit ; and the momentum builds , as the European Commission is making plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That there is some benefit in stopping people from smoking is undeniable ; it will save some lives . Also undeniable , however , is the overall lack of success governments have had in their attempts to discourage the use of similar substances  --  i.e. , drugs and alcohol  --  through legislation . We should try to resist the momentum for anti-smoking regulations , lest we wake up to find ourselves in a century-long " war on smoking " whose chief accomplishment is raising the price of cigarettes and fostering a new cohort of gangsters . <p> <p> " Mumia is a Parisian ! " cried Paris mayor Bertrand Delanoe after conferring citizenship on Mumia Abu-Jamal , the death-row cop-killer . We do n't know how it is now , but there were many points in Paris 's history when Abu-Jamal would have fit right in : the Commune , the June Days , the Terror ... <p> The newest , official Parisian <p> <p> The transformation of Osama bin Laden from nightmarish terrorist mastermind to annoying terrorist nuisance continues apace . A new audiotape aired by an Arab TV network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging young people in Iraq and neighboring countries to join in holy war against the American " crusaders . " With most of his generals dead or in U.S. custody , his bases trashed , his sanctuaries reduced to a few mountain caves in the Hindu Kush , his Saudi sponsors desperately dissociating themselves from him , and his funds sequestered , poor O.b.L. no longer cuts much of a figure . He might still be lethal , though probably only on a small scale , and it would be nice to finish our personal business with him ; but in the larger project of draining the Mideast swamp , Osama bin Laden is increasingly an irrelevance . <p> <p> It 's a first for a Muslim woman , Shirin Ebadi , to win the Nobel peace prize , which is in the gift of the Norwegians . A lawyer , she has worked for women 's rights in Iran , where no such rights exist in public or in private life . As an activist , she has written books and articles to the effect that the values of Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently the Iranian mullahs stopped trying to muzzle her with a prison sentence , and settled instead for a fine . Now they prefer to sound patronizing . President Mohammad Khatami said , " The Nobel peace prize is not that important . " There 's some truth in that  --  the last Muslim awarded this prize was Yasser Arafat . The mullahs may also hope to gain some mileage out of Ebadi , who is not really an anti-establishment figure by nature . On the day of the award , she happened to be in Paris , and at an instantly summoned news conference she may not have worn the compulsory head scarf but she made sure to criticize America 's intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq . Still , when she flew back to Tehran , 10,000 people turned up at the airport to greet her , in hopeful anticipation that even this symbolic gesture from Norway can only improve what they have to put up with daily . <p> <p> The Catholic Church celebrated the 25th anniversary of John Paul II 's papacy , a papacy sufficiently momentous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became Pope , educated elites in the West believed that secularization was the future ; and the great reforms of Vatican II were understood to represent a Catholic accommodation to the world . This philosopher-pope insisted to the contrary that neither material comfort nor technological expertise  --  nor even tyranny  --  could satisfy the soul 's desire for truth , which is to say , for God . He believed that Vatican II pointed the way toward an authentically Catholic engagement with the world , with liberal modernity . The Pope became a conservator of what is most valuable in liberalism . Enlightenment liberalism had exalted reason over superstition and the individual over oppression . But by the late 20th century , liberalism had lost its will to resist Communism and lost its faith in reason . The Pope stood up for the dignity of the human person against Communism  --  and , later , also against the subtler threats of decadence . Against the postmodernists , he asserted the value of reason : reason conceived not in mere instrumental terms , but as a path to wisdom . John Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He played an important role in the liberation of Eastern Europe , and thus in the victory of the Free World in the Cold War . He renewed his church , bringing into the fold millions of new Catholics in the poorest countries . He canonized hundreds of new saints , as though to teach that saintliness is possible ; indeed , obligatory . Perfection is not possible , however , and it must be said that there are black marks on the Pope 's record . The bishops lack discipline and oversight , as the sex-abuse scandals have made all too clear . Church doctrine on foreign policy has not developed much during this papacy . Anyone who has looked to the Vatican during the world crisis of the last two years has not found there anything helpful in reconciling the claims of peace , justice , and prudence . All too often , the desire for peace  --  defined mistakenly  --  has compromised the Church 's moral witness on tyranny does not claim to be . John Paul says that he has tried to serve God , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not ours to judge . But we have no doubt that in the future he will be called John Paul the Great . <p> <p> The Episcopal Church , U.S.A. , continues to struggle with the issue of openly homosexual clergy . One such , the Rev. Canon V. Gene Robinson , was elected bishop of New Hampshire this summer , to loud protests from conservatives in the Church . At a meeting in Dallas in early October , those conservatives called on the 38 provinces of the international Anglican communion to help them " realign " the E.C.U.S.A. One week later , representatives from 37 of those provinces assembled in London , with Church leaders from the Third World determined to discipline their American co-communicants . At last , however , after several hours of talks , the primates struck a compromise , issuing a statement that condemned the New Hampshire diocese while asking the Archbishop of Canterbury to conduct a formal investigation of the issue and report back in a year . Christians of other denominations must find the dispute baffling . Scripture is perfectly clear that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of traditional marriage are sinful , and that sinners , after first repenting their sins , should cease sinning . How can a person so obviously unrepentant in such obvious sin become a prelate in a major Christian church ? The deeper question is how those ancient Scriptural understandings can be squared with modern notions of " rights " and " discrimination . " From that point of view , this unsavory little drama concerns all Christians , not only Episcopalians . <p> <p> It is a sad story , and an ugly dispute . Terri Schiavo lost much of her brain function 13 years ago . In October , her husband had her feeding tube removed so that she would die of dehydration . The husband thinks she is , irreversibly , a vegetable . Her parents and siblings think she has some awareness , and that rehabilitation should be given a chance . Each side has its own experts . Schiavo 's family says that the husband won a $1.3 million medical-malpractice lawsuit on the assumption that the money would be used to take care of her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to inherit what 's left of the money that was to be spent on her care  --  and to marry his fiance , with whom he has had one child and is expecting another . They even say he may have caused her disablement through abuse . They wanted the State of Florida to intervene , and it did so , forcing the resumption of Mrs. Schiavo 's feeding . The legal battle does not appear to be over , however . Being in no position to judge the family 's allegations , we can only offer a general thought : that it is one thing to turn down medical interventions that would prolong suffering , and another to withhold food and water . It is the difference between accepting death , and willing it . <p> <p> Rush Limbaugh told his audience that he had indeed become addicted to painkillers following back surgery several years ago , as reported in the press . " I am no victim , " he added , " and do not portray myself as such . I take full responsibility for my problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and promised more details when the cops finish investigating the ring that supplied him . His admirers appreciate his forthrightness and wish him a complete recovery . In a fundamentally just society , the law deserves respect even if particular laws do not . Rush had no good reason for violating that dictum , as he readily admits . He should further reflect on the fact that the pharmacopeia is bursting with legal drugs that can be more harmful than proscribed substances like marijuana . All this is for later , after he is restored to health and has resumed his " excursion into broadcast excellence . " <p> <p> Gregg Easterbrook , a writer for The New Republic , went off on a weird tangent in the course of an attack on Kill Bill . The movie was produced by Miramax , which is owned by Disney . Easterbrook noted that the executives who run Miramax and Disney are both Jewish . He continued , " Yes , there are plenty of Christian and other Hollywood executives who worship money above all else , promoting for profit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish executives to worship money above all else , by promoting for profit the adulation of violence ? Recent European history alone ought to cause Jewish executives to experience second thoughts about glorifying the killing of the helpless as a fun lifestyle choice . " The suggestion would seem to be that Jews have a special responsibility not to glorify violence , or at least a special interest in not glorifying it . Taken seriously , that thought implies that Jews who nonetheless glorify violence deserve more blame than non-Jews who do so . You do not have to be thin-skinned , or Jewish , to find that idea offensive . Easterbrook was harshly criticized for his comments . He apologized : " It was terrible that I implied that the Jewishness of studio executives has anything whatsoever to do with awful movies like Kill Bill .... Where I failed most is in the two sentences about adoration of money . I noted that many Christian executives adore money above all else , and in the 20-minute reality of blog composition , that seemed to me , writing it , fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adoring money above all else does not engage any history of ugly stereotypes . Accuse a Jewish person of this and you invoke a thousand years of stereotypes about that which Jews have specific historical reasons to fear . What I wrote here was simply wrong , and for being wrong , I apologize . " ESPN.com nonetheless fired him as a columnist . ( Perhaps that 's poetic justice , given that Easterbrook piled on Rush Limbaugh for his own recent ESPN comments . ) The Anti-Defamation League said that Easterbrook 's apology was " insufficient " and that he had not rejected " anti-Semitic stereotypes . " Then The New Republic apologized for running Easterbrook 's offending column . Enough already . Easterbrook expressed a foolish thought poorly . But in context it seems clear that he was not saying that Jewish executives are unusually greedy , or greedy because they are Jewish ; and his apology rejects those ideas . The apology should be accepted . <p> <p> In one of the most bizarre news judgments ever , CBS ran a two-part expos of homeschooling , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger , " and " even killed while homeschooling , " e.g. by murderess Andrea Yates .
