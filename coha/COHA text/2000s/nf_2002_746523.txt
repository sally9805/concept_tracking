Question : " Where does Europe end ? " Answer : " Somewhere south of Vienna . " - Old Austrian saying <p> <p> A new curtain , a " Golden Curtain , " is being drawn across the heart of Europe . It stretches from the Arctic Circle in the north , thus including Finland and the Baltic countries , to the Adriatic coast in the south , thus incorporating Slovenia and Croatia but not the other countries of the former Yugoslavia nor , for now , Romania and Bulgaria . The new curtain may be more flexible and permeable and have less barbed wire than the old Iron Curtain , and there are a number of " halfway houses " as well as some disputed territories along the border , but there can be no doubt that a new kind of wall is going up , whose barriers and " crossing guards " ( the Schengen immigration rules ) may be almost as strict . The drawing of this new curtain is giving rise to cries that a " new Yalta " is being created , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to a future of backwardness and underdevelopment. 1 <p> The Golden Curtain may be defined as separating those countries that are " making it " into the European community , most obviously via NATO and EU enlargement but in other ways as well , and those that are not . The stated criteria for admission into NATO and the EU sound institutional and perhaps rather dry , and there are all those NATO expectations of military interoperability and the eighty thousand ( ! ) requirements of the EU 's Acquis Communautaire to which aspirant countries must conform . But the final decisions on who gets in and who does not depend , ultimately , on political criteria . And increasingly those are being defined , informally if not yet publicly , along cultural , religious , ethnic , linguistic , and political-cultural as well as socioeconomic and strategic lines . Now that the old and somewhat artificial barriers of the Iron Curtain have fallen , Europe is once again wrestling with the question of where Western civilization begins and , even more important for our purposes , where it ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West ; in practice the hurdles and barriers to entrance are again becoming harder to overcome . <p> In the process of determining who belongs on which side of the Golden Curtain , all the old cultural , geographic , religious , historical , and ethnic reckonings , sentiments , biases , and dividing lines of the past are again coming into play . The end of the cold war might have inspired a reappraisal of what Europe once was and could become-and perhaps it did in the heady , hopeful years of the early 1990s-but at this stage the process seems to have run its course and the gates are being closed once again . Europe can not admit this openly , of course ( and slaps down Austria 's Jorg Haider when he has the effrontery to do so ) , but we should not have illusions concerning the fact that such attitudes are being resurrected . History may have " ended " in terms of the great ideological and systems debates of the past , but it is also alive and well in the debate over where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elites ( as exemplified by the European Union ) and the public have their views , not always exactly corresponding , on these matters , and the result is a dynamic political process that often has only limited relation to the formal requirements of membership in the twin European clubs of NATO and the EU . <p> As Europe rediscovers its pre-cold war and even ancient history , old debates and conflicts are being resurrected , often in new , sometimes shockingly new , forms . Where did the ancient Greek and Roman influences ( the earliest definition of " Western civilization " ) end ? How far did Christianity extend to the east and south , and where does Western Christianity , in both its Protestant and Catholic forms , bump up against Eastern Orthodoxy on one side and the Islamic borders of the old Ottoman empire on the other ? Where are the outer limits of historic , " Western , " German , Scandinavian , Polish , and Hapsburg ( in the form of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire ) influence , and where does this start impinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Ottoman lands ? The questions being asked include , Are the Easterners ( Russians , Georgians , Ukrainians , Belarussians ) and Southeasterners ( the Balkans , Turks ) like us ? Do they share our values ? Are they " civilized " ? Can they assimilate ? Can we absorb their immigrants ? Will they drag us down ? In other words , beneath the formal and often arcane discussion about who will be invited to join NATO and the EU in the next rounds is an even more fundamental and venerable question of how far east and south Europe goes and " civilization " extends . And who , therefore , in modern national terms , is included or excluded : Belarussians , Ukrainians , Hungarians , Georgians , Croats , Serbs , Montenegrans , Bosnians , Poles , Kosovars , Macedonians , Moravians , Romanians , Bulgarians , Georgians , Turks , Czechs , Slovaks , Slovenes , Croats , Russians , Estonians , Latvians , Lithuanians , who ? <p> The old Iron Curtain has been dismantled ; I even have a piece of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the National War College . But " the wall " remains ; it has just moved a ways east , and different criteria are being used to define it . It is a cultural wall , a religious wall , and a socio-psychological wall as well as an economic and strategic one . In this article , therefore , I seek to identify what criteria are being discussed at street level or de facto being used to draw the new lines in addition to the formal ones and , ultimately , where the new , often informal boundaries of Europe are being drawn . DEFINITIONS OF EUROPE <p> The definitions of Europe and its distinguishing characteristics have varied over time. 2 Defined purely in geographical terms , the continent of Europe stretches all the way from the Atlantic Ocean east to the Ural Mountains , thus cutting Russia in half and causing immense confusion , not least in Russia itself . To the north and south its borders are often said to be the Arctic Ocean and the Caspian , Black , and Mediterranean Seas , but that also leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Transcaucasuses , and the southern ( and Islamic ) members of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) . <p> But there are other definitions of Europe besides the geographical . Recently Greece , which thinks of itself as the font of Western civilization , has raised a storm of protest in the EU over that body 's decision to found a Museum of Europe whose exhibits begin not with antiquity but with Charlemagne 's empire in the ninth century A.D. , which presumably set Europe on the path of unification , the main theme of the museum . The Greeks argue instead that the story of Ulysses is European culture 's founding myth and are supporting an alternative exhibit sponsored by the Council of Europe that promotes that view . Meanwhile , EU officials at the Museum of Europe respond that ( a ) Greek civilization failed to promote a larger European consciousness , and ( b ) both ancient Greece and Rome discriminated sharply between citizens and slaves as well as outsiders ( " barbarians " ) and therefore were not inclusionary or multicultural . One can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give rise and the divisions ( the elite vs. the masses , EU officialdom vs. the man on the street , intellectuals vs . Joe citizens , and leftists vs. rightists ) that will form . Meanwhile , though the Greeks have threatened to veto the museum project , Italy has so far been silent. 3 <p> In Roman times the line between " civilization " and " barbarism " was roughly the Danube and Rhine Rivers ; anything north and east of that was considered uncivilized . Hence , we have another division across Europe , a north-south one , that persisted into modern times in the division between the Catholic , Mediterranean , and less-developed south versus the Protestant , developed , industrialized north . <p> It took several centuries after the fall of Rome for Europe to be reconstituted , this time in the form of the Holy Roman Empire of Charlemagne ( crowned 800 A.D. ) . Charlemagne had bridged the Rhine and Danube to extend civilization both north and east ; his kingdom encompassed a territory roughly coterminous with that of the original members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Benelux countries ) , which was also seen in a sense as constituting Europe-certainly that 's how Museum of Europe officials see it . The " empire " was really a decentralized collection of states ( recall Voltaire 's much-later quip that it was neither holy , nor Roman , nor an empire ) and its borders fluctuated over the centuries . Nevertheless , even in medieval times there was a sense that the empire and its domains constituted Europe . Western Christendom , or for short , " the West . " <p> Meanwhile , other dividing lines were being strung across Europe . There was the split between the Western Catholic Church centered in Rome , with Charlemagne , his successors , and the Holy Roman Empire as its leaders and territorial base , and the Eastern Orthodox Church centered in Byzantium . By the ninth and tenth centuries A.D. Catholicism had spread north and east into Central and Eastern Europe to Hungary ( 1000 A.D. ) , Poland ( 966 ) , and Lithuania ( 1386 ) . ( Croatia , Slovenia , Austria , the Czech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile orthodoxy had virtually contemporaneously spread north from Byzantium into Serbia ( 850 A.D. ) , Bulgaria ( 865 ) , Moldova and Ukraine ( 972 ) , Georgia , Belarus , and Russia ( 996 ) . <p> Religion was at that time the main carrier of culture and civilization ; from then on , Central and Eastern Europe 4-Catholic , historically conservative , eventually nationalistic ( remarkably similar in their political-cultural aspects to Spain and Portugal , on the other periphery of Europe ) - looked mainly to the West for their political , economic , religious , and cultural guidelines , even while recognizing what we would call their increasingly less-developed socioeconomic status . At the same time the East ( Eastern Orthodoxy ) took its spiritual lead from Constantinople but its political leadership ( including-relevant to modern times-Serbia ) from Kiev/Russia . The rise and spread of Islam would provide a third religious dividing line across southeast Europe ; in the sixteenth century the Protestant Reformation provided still another divisive element , although by the end of the century most of Eastern/Central Europe had been restored to Catholicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Netherlands , or Scandinavia . Over time the differences between Protestant and Catholic Christianity in East/Central Europe would fade but the Catholic-Orthodox , Catholic-Muslim , and Orthodox-Muslim chasms would remain wide . <p> War , invasion , and empire provide still another way of defining ( and dividing ) Europe . Historically , Eastern and Central Europe have been subject to repeated invasions : Huns , Mongolians , Magyars , Tatars , Russians , Ottoman Turks , and others from the east ; Germans , Swedes , Poles , French , Italians , and Danes from the west . Meanwhile , although their histories are largely unknown to students of Western history , several indigenous empires were established in Eastern/Central Europe : the vast Polish-Lithuanian empire of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries that covered much of Eastern and Central Europe ( including large swatches of Belarus and the western Ukraine ) , the Magyar empire of the later fifteenth century , also encompassing much of Central Europe , including western Ukraine and northwestern Romania ( Transylvania ) , and then the Austro-Hungarian empire in the fifteenth and sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicant countries to NATO and the EU , including Hungary , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Croatia , Slovenia , and parts of Romania and Serbia , to say nothing of Spain , the Low Countries , large parts of Italy , and Latin America , too . <p> These empires mainly identified themselves with the West and Western Christendom ; they saw their role in part as civilizing the peoples and migrants from the east ; and they also came to view themselves as on the frontiers of Western civilization and as being the bulwarks and the defenders of Western civilization-from Tatars , Ottomans , Russians , and others . Meanwhile , as the best book on the subject makes clear , Eastern/Central Europe began to develop a self-identity as part of the West but also as a buffer , " Middle Europe , " to use the German term , lying geographically between its two great and sometimes threatening neighbors : Germany to the west and Russia to the east. 5 That self-identity was submerged for a time under Soviet occupation ; it resurfaced for a brief period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now seems to be fading once again as East/Central Europe is drawn inexorably into the Western ( EU , NATO ) orbit . <p> Renaissance Europe eventually included most of the Western , Northeastern , and Central European countries but excluded Russia and much of the Balkans . However , both Peter the Great and Catherine the Great sought-only partly successfully-to " Westernize " Russia . Napoleon abolished the Holy Roman Empire and , in an effort to extend his own power and Europe 's frontiers , sent his armies deep into Russia , where they were eventually overcome by distance , vastness , and inadequate supply lines . Hitler 's Third Reich similarly sought European domination both in the west and the east and likewise bogged down and was defeated in the vast expanse of Russia . In short , not only are there distinct definitions of Europe based on geography , religion , culture , politics , economics , sociology , and ethnicity , but the boundaries of Europe 's influence are constantly shifting as well because of war , empire , and the mass migrations of peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe was the Iron Curtain-roughly corresponding , incidentally , to the eastern border of Charlemagne 's Carolinian Empire in the ninth century A.D. Although the Iron Curtain was a defining reality of most of our lifetimes , many historians thought of it as an artificial and temporary dividing line . ( They in turn were viewed as naive by many national security experts who thought the curtain would never come down . ) Over the previous one thousand years Eastern/Central Europe had not only come to have its own identity but had also identified itself far more with the West than the East . Then , when the Berlin Wall actually fell , the Warsaw Pact dissolved , the Iron Curtain disappeared , and the Soviet Union disintegrated , the idea became widespread that Europe might finally fill its geographic parameters , encompassing the Commonwealth of Independent States and perhaps Russia as well-becoming a Europe , in President George H. W. Bush 's words , " whole and free . " <p> Let us conclude this part of the discussion of Europe 's alternative definitions and fluctuating , overlapping boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derisively , as " Madeleine 's Map . " 6 This was a map of Europe that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright handed to the Europeans in May 2000 . It contained a series of confusing , overlapping boundary lines in different colors that appeared to the Europeans to represent the efforts of a child with crayons run amok . The first circle ( in blue ) showed the fifteen members of the European Union . The second circle ( in red ) encompassed the nineteen current members of NATO , while the next circle ( in green ) showed the seven NATO aspirant countries . The fourth circle ( in brown ) was for the eleven countries that had adopted the new single currency , the euro , while the fifth ( in yellow ) was for the six countries of East/Central Europe thought to be on the fast track to EU membership . An orange sixth circle showed the other later and presumably slower EU aspirants , and a seventh violet one indicated the twelve countries that had agreed to the Schengen Accord for border control . Three more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost disappear into the far eastern horizon : one was for the forty-three countries ( including Russia ) that compose the Council of Europe ( which also runs the European Court of Human Rights ) ; the next was for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which incorporates no fewer than fifty-five countries ; and the of Central Asia . This was " Europe , " as Secretary of State James Baker once said , stretching " from Vancouver to Vladivostok . " It was also enormously confusing , leaving open , at least officially , the question of Europe 's farthest borders . The map also seemed , in its confounding and overlapping circles , to echo Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 's similarly derisive question : " When I want to speak to Europe , whom do I call ? " <p> Europe is not yet " whole and free , " and there is presently much confusion and concern about where its borders lie . Significantly , the new lines being drawn correspond almost exactly to the historic boundaries , fault lines of empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved to be correct ; with modification and nuance , the ancient dividing lines have reasserted themselves-often to the frustration of U.S. political and strategic planners who must deal with such relatively recent phenomena as peace and security in Eastern Europe and NATO and EU enlargement . So let us begin peeling back the layers of this onion to see where Europe does , in fact , now begin and end . HISTORICAL , CULTURAL , AND DEVELOPMENTALIST FAULT LINES <p> A variety of factors-geographic , religious , linguistic , strategic , ethnic , historical , socio-psychological , and developmental-have shaped the dividing lines , both historic and contemporary , in Europe and , particularly for our purposes , at the frontier between Europe and its outside perimeter . Geography <p> Hardly anyone , to our shame , studies geography anymore or thinks it important , let alone takes a geographic determinist position . Nevertheless , three points need to be made in consideration of the geographic factor . <p> First , what we now call Central Europe-defined provisionally as those lands located between Russia on the one hand and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain that reaches from France and the Low Countries in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east . Historically , this has been what Adrian Hyde-Price calls the " crunch zone " between Europe and Asia , the route by which marauding , conquering Central Asian tribes-Huns , Magyars , Tatars , others-have invaded Europe. 7 This was also the route by which it was feared that Soviet armies would invade Europe , across Poland and through the Folda Pass . It should be said that there was also a reverse process : it was also the route by which Western armies-those of Sweden 's Gustavus Adolphus , Napoleon , Hitler-attacked and sought to expand east into the Russian heartland . The point to be made here is that this is the area that nineteenth-century geostrategist Harold Mackinder ( or more recently Zbigniew Brzezinski ) called the Euro-Asian " heartland " or " pivot area . " Whoever controlled this territory , in his view , controlled the world. 8 The result is that Central Europe was repeatedly subject to invasions from east and west ; many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its territory ; its nascent agriculture and cities have repeatedly been destroyed by battle and marauding bands ; and , as a further result of all these invasions , Central Europe has the most complex ethnic makeup of all of Europe , peopled in many places by small ethnic groups insufficient to constitute a separate nation-state . <p> A second point has to do with distance . Central/Eastern Europe is on the periphery of Europe . If one 's conceptual framework is center-periphery relations , then Eastern or Central Europe is a marvelous laboratory . In this sense , Central Europe is much like Southern Europe . If London , Paris , Amsterdam , now Brussels , Strasbourg , and Berlin are at the heart of modern or modernizing Europe , then Central ( or Southern ) Europe , especially in premodern times , is a very long way from the European centers of progress and development-not only physically but social-psychologically as well . Central/Eastern Europe , like Southern Europe , missed out on the early stirrings of the Enlightenment , the Industrial Revolution , and the movement toward limited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period thus remained feudal and two-class ; economic development and industrialization came slower and more unevenly than in Europe 's core . <p> Distance and underdevelopment bred resentments and complexes . Western Europe looked condescendingly on the East ( witness that line in My Fair Lady when Professor Higgins proclaims that " she was born Hungarian , " which always brings down the house with derisive laughter ) , while Eastern and Central Europe resented the West 's superiority . They desperately wanted to join the West culturally and economically ( as in today 's effort to join NATO and the EU ) but were prepared to angrily go their own way ( independently or back to Russia ? ) should the West reject them . Again there are parallels with Southern Europe , as Greece , Portugal , and Spain in the mid-1970s were similarly prepared to follow their own Mediterranean , Atlanticist , or even Third World strategies if they were ultimately rejected by Europe . To sum up , it is almost a law of European development that the farther east toward the periphery one goes from Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic the country is likely to be and the deeper the resentment toward the West . By the same token , the closer one lies to Europe 's center , the higher the correlation with development , democracy , and national self-confidence . <p> The third point has to do with the internal geography of these regions . In general , the farther east one goes , the worse the farming becomes-until one gets to the great Russian steppes , but that is another story . Unlike France , the Low Countries , or Germany , which are wealthy in terms of geography , resources , and agriculture , many of the countries to the east , especially in the southeast , have poor soils , rocky terrains unconducive to large-scale agriculture , chopped-up geographies that make internal communications and transportation difficult , and poor or limited resources generally . The Czech lands ( Bohemia , Moravia ) are relatively rich and prosperous in mineral wealth and agriculture , but Slovakia , except for the Danube Plain , is mostly poor and mountainous . Austria and Hungary have rich , well-used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not . As one travels southeast through the Balkans , Slovenia is a relatively rich country , including agriculturally , and is tied into the wealthy economies of Austria and Italy ; Croatia has some good agricultural land but the beginnings of a mountainous terrain ; and much of the rest of the former Yugoslavia is mountainous , with some good agriculture scattered in the valleys , but little area amenable to mechanization . Moreover , the farming in those areas is less well organized , is more primitive , seems ( despite the socialist and postsocialist changes ) quasi-feudal . And without good agriculture and the surpluses derived from it , industrialization would also lag in this part of the world . <p> Obviously , these considerations can not be taken as iron-clad law . Poland is a major exception as a rich agricultural area that nevertheless remained underdeveloped , in part because Poland 's agriculture was organized inefficiently and was periodically destroyed by invading armies , and in part because Poland all but disappeared as a country during the formative nineteenth century , when it was partitioned between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia ) . Despite these qualifiers , the underdevelopment of East and Central Europe may in part be accounted for by their geographic location , characteristics , and resources , or the lack thereof . And that has also helped shape their social , political , and cultural orientation . Religion <p> Americans are not used to talking about religion anymore , especially about religion 's political ramifications , and are often uncomfortable doing so . Having notions of the strict separation of church and state , Americans tend not to inquire too closely-at least publicly-into a person 's religious beliefs , nor do we seek-again , at least publicly-to explain public policy preferences and outcomes by the religious or ethnic beliefs and backgrounds of those who advocate them . America may have blinders to what is still a useful explanatory paradigm-particularly , as we shall see , in Eastern Europe ; but Americans seem to have concluded that the social and political costs of talking about religion or using it as an explanation are greater than the benefits to be derived . But that is not necessarily the case in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) religion is often more strongly felt and internalized than in increasingly secular America and Western Europe ; ( b ) religion is part of the political culture , often closely identified , as in Poland , with nationalism and nationhood ; ( c ) religion is a part of public discourse , in contrast to the " separation " concept of American public policy ; and ( d ) religion is a powerful explanatory factor in understanding both conflict within the Eastern/Central European area and the relatively greater or lesser development of the countries of the area . In Eastern and Central Europe there is almost a " law of physics " comparable to the law reflecting geography : tell me the predominant religion in a particular country and I will tell you whether that country is likely to be developed , democratic , and a serious prospect for integration into broader European counsels . <p> One of the fundamental divides in Eastern and Central Europe is between Roman Catholicism on the one hand and Eastern Orthodoxy on the other . An even more fundamental and deep-seated division is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic Europe . Those divisions are particularly prevalent and powerful in the Balkans . Indeed , in many respects the Balkan wars of the 1990s can be seen as a resurrection of the age-old religious animosities between Christian and Muslim , with the Bosnian , Kosovo , or Albanian Muslims being assigned the role of " Turks " or " Islamic aggressors " and the Serbs ( mainly in their own eyes ) playing the role of defenders of Christianity and civilization . National missions in this part of the world have often been defined in religious terms ( using terms like " chosen people , " " bulwarks of Christendom , " " defenders of the faith or of Western civilization " ) and directed against " the Other " : " infidels " or " schismatics " or " heretics . " <p> Beginning in the ninth century A.D. , missionaries from the Greek Orthodox Church centered in Byzantium fanned out to neighboring territories in the Balkans , Ukraine , and Russia , leading to the conversion of their leaders and ultimately their peoples and to the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give or take a century ) , Roman Catholic clerics mainly originating in Germany began the conversion of rulers and peoples to the east , including present-day Poland , Czech Republic , Austria , Slovakia , Hungary , Slovenia , and the lower Baltics ( Lithuania ) . In some cases Christianity reached further east and south to include the western provinces of the Ukraine and Romania ( Transylvania ) and the northernmost province ( Vojvodina ) of Yugoslavia , which remain divided today and , because of these distinct traditions , often carry strong separatist tendencies . The Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century divided a number of those countries internally as well as producing international conflict mainly in the German lands , but by the end of that century the Catholic Counter-Reformation had recaptured most of East/Central Europe for the Roman Church , leaving only minority Protestant groups in Czechoslovakia , Austria , and Hungary . The basic divide , therefore , between Catholic and Orthodox Europe persisted and was even reinforced . <p> The conversion of much of Eastern and Central Europe to Christianity was far more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically underdeveloped and uncivilized lands , converting to Christianity symbolized progress and culture , and Eastern/Central Europe came to see itself as enforcing a civilizational dividing line , as the defender of Western civilization against the barbarians to the east and southeast . The conversion to Christianity also marked a turning point from preliteracy to literacy , from barbarism to culture and civilization , from primitive tribal forms of organization to more sophisticated feudalism . At this stage , in Hegelian or Marxian terms , Eastern and Central Europe entered " history , " writ large . Being Christian meant being modern , developed , Western , having a chance to catch up to the rest of Europe and overcome those historic inferiority complexes noted earlier . Eastern and Central Europe might still be on the periphery of Europe , but at least they were now part of Europe , which meant progress and advancement . In later centuries , moreover , the particular religious or denominational form that religion took in various countries helped provide national identity and determine , for good or ill , who " belonged " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Other-again , Jews and Gypsies ( Roma ) but other religious schismatics and minorities , too . <p> The religious orientation of the various countries also had a profound effect on their political cultures and developmental possibilities . Religion in Eastern and Central Europe , in other words , is not neutral , nor is it confined just to the religious realm . For example , the Hapsburg rulers in the vast Austro-Hungarian empire , like their sixteenth- and seventeenth-century cousins in Spain and Portugal , used the authoritarian , hierarchical , and fatalislic ( accepting one 's station in life ) features of traditional , medieval , Thomistic Catholicism as a way of enhancing and reinforcing their absolutist authority and of keeping their peoples submissive and locked in place . But that authoritarian structure faded over time , enabling a Catholic country such as Austria to become successful both as a democracy and as one of the world 's richest societies . Moreover , Hapsburg authoritarianism was nothing compared to the Eastern Orthodox Church , which was even more hierarchical and top-down , entirely subordinate to state power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible government . However authoritarian the Roman Catholic Church was for a long time , it was nevertheless strongly influenced by the Renaissance , the Enlightenment , the French Revolution , and eventually modern liberalizing currents in ways that the Eastern Church was not . The Eastern peoples remained passive and submissive far longer than their Central European and Catholic counterparts ; they were " medieval , " according to the best new book on the subject , rather than modernizing. 10 The history of the Roman Church , not always exactly glorious , was thus intertwined with Westernization and modernization in Eastern and Central Europe whereas the church at Byzantium and the lands where its influence held sway were not . <p> The religious divide separating Catholic from Eastern Orthodox Europe was reinforced by language as well as the alphabet . Language , literature , and alphabets provide a means to measure political culture , as do religion , music , and art . And here again the divisions are sharp . The Orthodox countries of Bulgaria , Russia , Belarus , the Ukraine , Serbia , and until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Roman Empire , it was Orthodox but not Slavik ) all use the Cyrillic alphabet , historically looked to Byzantium for spiritual guidance , and after Constantinople 's fall generally relied on Russia for political and military leadership . In contrast , Roman Catholic or " Latin " Eastern/Central Europe , including Slovenia , Croatia , Hungary , the Czech lands , Slovakia , Poland , Austria , and the lower Baltics , used the Latin alphabet , looked to Rome and the West for spiritual guidance , and took the culture and nation-state of the West as their model . Dare it be said at this early point in the discussion that the latter countries are all leading candidates for admission to NATO and/or the EU in the first or second round , while the former countries are all distant candidates , if they have any chance at all ? It is not that language or use of alphabet is a qualifier or disqualifier per se , but they are parts of a larger package of cultural , social , economic , and political traits that do serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century and beyond , a new political-religious divide appeared in Eastern/Central Europe ; it involved the crusading conquests of the Islamic Ottoman Turks from their base in Asia Minor , up through the Balkans , through Hungary , and on to the gates of Vienna , where they were twice repulsed , in 1529 and 1683 . The Ottomans did not make a concerted effort to convert , by persuasion or force , the Balkan peoples whom they conquered , but they did rule the area for four centuries , imposing their law and absolutist imperial administration on the area , destroying Southeastern Europe 's emerging feudal institutions which must be seen as progressive at the time , and cutting off Southeast Europe even more than the central or eastern areas from the modernizing currents of the West . Moreover , even though they failed to take Vienna , the Turks occupied Hungary for 150 years ( forever tainting that country in the eyes of some of its neighbors ) and most of the Balkans until the nineteenth century , when those states were able to liberate themselves . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern Serbia were more fully liberated from the Ottomans and more quickly rejoined Christianity ; Romania and Bulgaria less so . In contrast , present-day Serbia , Montenegro , and Macedonia were mixed ; and Bosnia , Kosovo , and Albania converted to Islam . <p> From time immemorial Eastern/Central Europe has been a mixing bowl of migratory groups , some stimulated by peaceful movements and others by war and conflict . As historian Lonnie R. Johnson has written , it is " the most ethnically heterogeneous and religiously heterodox region in Europe. 11 Moreover , as Johnson 's comment implies , religion and ethnicity have often reinforced each other , thus solidifying difference , division , and conflict over consensus and what Tocqueville called " the art of living together . " <p> I can not begin to analyze in detail all those ethnic movements , changes , and displacements here ; I mention only some of them for illustrative purposes . Thus , as early as the Middle Ages , ethnic Germans were already moving eastward into Poland , the Baltics , the Ukraine , Bohemia , Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy today of entry of a number of those nations into the European Union . Meanwhile , a Polish presence was also established in the Baltic countries , Belarus , the Ukraine , and present-day Slovakia , helping to give rise to the vast Polish-Lithuanian kingdom of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . Ethnic Russians moved into border areas such as the Baltics , Belarus , Ukraine , Georgia , Poland , and Slovakia , thus complicating some of these nations ' efforts to join NATO or the EU . Present-day Hungary was similarly a melting pot of Magyars , Slovaks , Ruthanes , Romanians , Germans , Gypsies ( Roma ) , and Jews . The former Yugoslavia consisted not only of Slovenes , Croats , Serbs , Montenegrans , Albanians , Kosovars , and Macedonians but also of Turks , Greeks , Italians , Romanians , Germans , Magyars , and Bulgarians . Today , Slovakia , Romania , and the Ukraine have sizable Hungarian ( and Christian ) populations that still yearn for reunification with Hungary , while Bulgaria has a sizable Turkish minority not fully assimilated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these migrant groups as we think of immigrant groups today : as poor nomads looking for a better life . There was often an economic or political purpose to these migrations other than simply escaping poverty . Many German burghers were valued for their commercial skills and were recruited to found new towns and cities in the East so that entrepreneurialism could flourish . The Germans were also valued for their farming skills and technologies , so that all over Eastern and Central Europe one finds German agricultural communities that may or may not be assimilated into local cultures and whose presence helped serve as rationalization for German military aggression eastward in World War II . Throughout Eastern and Central Europe Serbs were often employed as mercenaries , and they then settled in separate communities in the areas where they had served . In Hungary , Southern Germans were brought in to reinforce Catholicism and supplement and presumably provide new energy and know-how for the local Magyar aristocracy . In this way , not only did the immigrants often settle in their own unassimilated territories or communities , but they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the first time . Because of the many ethnic changes and migrations over the century , it was not unusual in that part of the world for people in the towns and cities to speak one language and to be made up of one or several ethnic groups , and the countryside of another , or for the gentry to speak one language and be of one ethnicity , and the peasants or middle class of another . <p> It is often said of the Balkans , for example , that they are basically " tribal " societies that had the bad fortune to be organized on that traditional basis at a time in the nineteenth century when Western European-style nationalism and national boundaries were inappropriately imposed on them , largely from the outside . In this sense the Balkans in the nineteenth century ( and perhaps in some respects today ) were comparable to Africa in the 1960s : basically tribal or ethnic societies with ill-fitting , Western-designed national borders and the trappings of the European nation-state imposed on them . But in my analysis the situation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of East/Central Europe , and especially the Balkans , still " tribally " based , but the differences between towns and countryside , between educated and uneducated , between the elites and the masses all tend to reinforce and perpetuate the sharp ethnic and religious differences that already exist . <p> Nor should we assume that any of the relations just analyzed are stable or permanent . War , revolution , invasion , plague , migratory movements , ethnic cleansing , and the comings and goings of empires have all affected the social makeup , ethnic composition , and class structure of Eastern and Central Europe . For example , the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans from the thirteenth through the sixteenth centuries sent many Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes fleeing north , where they either served as mercenary troops employed against the Turks or settled in new locations in Bohemia ( Czech Republic ) , Slovakia , Austria , Hungary , or previously ethnically Hungarian Vojvodina . As the Serbs moved north , recently converted Muslim Albanians moved into the depopulated territories such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Balkans after their failure to capture Vienna , and eventually pushed out of there as well , Germans , Austrians , Slovaks , Magyars , Croats , and Slovenes moved back into the territories they had vacated ( while also leaving behind ethnic communities in other territories where their peoples had earlier settled ) , adding further to the ethnic mix-to say nothing of the frequent desire to settle old scores , gain revenge , or pursue policies of irredentism . For example , Hungary 's continued talk about the plight of minority ethnic Hungarians in Romania , Slovakia , and Serbia is an irritant to other NATO members for whom such border issues were supposedly settled and forgotten when Hungary joined NATO . <p> I have focused in this brief discussion on what I will call the Turkish-Austro/Hungarian frontier , but there were others as well , as empires ebbed and flowed . These include the Swedish , Russian , Tatar , Polish-Lithuanian , Magyar , Ukrainian , Bavarian , Romanian , Prussian-German , even Danish ( ! ) empires . All left in their wakes unassimilated or only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often resentful ethnic minorities , class and social structures that also reflected historic ethnic and/or religious backgrounds , peoples often uncertain or confused about their cross-cultural roots , and such polka-dotted territories of infinitely complex ethnic and social relations that one needs to possess a vast knowledge of history , to say nothing of cultural anthropology , to figure them all out . Nevertheless , it must also be said that with the massive , unprecedented " ethnic cleansing " of World War II and the redrawing of many national borders afterward , more of the Eastern/Central European countries are more ethnically homogeneous now than at any time in their history . The recent conflict and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia may in part be considered a continuation of that process . Public Attitudes <p> Eastern/Central Europe is also defined by public as well as private attitudes . This may be expressed in a variety of forms : official designations , unofficial attitudes , jokes and stories ( often ethnically based ) , and public opinion surveys . But they all tend to reinforce the conclusions toward which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe are being drawn . <p> Official designations . In 1994 President Vaclav Havel asked his fellow " Central European " heads of state to come together to discuss the future of the region . Those invited included the presidents of Austria , Germany , Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , and Slovenia . Note who was invited as well as who was left out : Bulgaria , Romania , Belarus , Ukraine , Russia , Serbia , Croatia . That is how the lines were drawn , at least in one official designation , in 1994 . Significantly , all the heads of state posed in front of a life-sized portrait of the Hapsburg monarchy in the eighteenth century , perhaps symbolizing the resurrection in new form of the old Austro-Hungarian empire . <p> When the European Union officially invited candidate countries to apply for accession , the first tranche of fast-track applicants included Poland , Estonia , Czech Republic , Hungary , and Slovenia . All of them are predominantly Christian countries and all but Estonia are predominantly Roman Catholic . They are also the most economically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of so-called other applicants , some of whom are making strenuous efforts and may catch up with some of the first group , consists of Latvia , Lithuania , Slovakia , Romania , and Bulgaria . Turkey has been " recognized as a candidate . " In contrast , Russia , Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova , and the other successor states of the former Yugoslavia were not at the end of 1999 even considered as possibilities . In short , the line drawn by the European Union in terms of invited countries stopped at the border of the CIS and Yugoslavia ( except for developed Slovenia ) . But now with the changes of governments in Croatia and Serbia , their leaders are regularly invited to meetings of European leaders and preliminary steps are already under way to prepare them for future possible EU or NATO membership . But the leaders of Bosnia , Albania , Kosovo , Ukraine , Moldova , Georgia , Belarus , and Russia , often to their chagrin , still are not ; they and their countries are being left out . <p> Unofficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation lists ( with the two often reinforcing one another ) in determining who belongs in Europe. 12 Those who are all but universally accepted as " Europeans " include the Baltics , Poles , Czechs , Hungarians , and Slovenes . Those who are worrisome but nevertheless probably acceptable over time are the Slovaks and Croats . At a lower and marginal level are the Romanians and Bulgarians . Unacceptable are Belarussians , Russians , Ukrainians , Moldovans , Serbs ( whose status is now changing ) , and Turks-although once again , because of strategic reasons and the presence of millions of Turks already within EU member countries , Turkey may be a special case . <p> In addition , almost all East/Central Europeans recognize that there are marginal or border areas that lie outside the currently acceptable borders of Europe but nevertheless " belong with the West " : they include the western provinces of Ukraine , the northernmost province ( Vojvodina ) in Serbia , and Transylvania in Romania , as the often more developed , Christian and/or Uniate ( using Orthodox rites but acknowledging papal authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite definite about these dividing lines . I have heard even highly educated Austrians say of those across that new east-west boundary that we are describing , " They do n't think like us ; they do n't act like us ; they do n't have the same values . " It perhaps goes without saying that lower-class or popular attitudes toward those from the East , who may threaten their jobs and security , are even more scathing and ethnically prejudiced . <p> Such attitudes , which are usually portrayed as anti-immigrant but are really much deeper than that , involving religion , culture , language , education , self-identification , and even the definitions of " civilization " described earlier , to say nothing of pressures on labor markets , taxes , and social services , form the base of support for Jorg Haider and the Austrian Freedom Party . They also help explain why countries such as Austria , with one of the world 's highest per capita incomes and almost literally surrounded by new EU applicant countries , wants as a condition of its voting for EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of peoples from new EU countries into older members would be allowed . Wealthy Germany has many of the same fears ; as one German high government official told me rather crudely , " Berlin is already the second largest Turkish city in the world . We do not want to become the largest Turkish city . " <p> Attitudes such as these are hard to systematize or to deal with in a rigorous social scientific way . But they are important nonetheless , maybe critical . For example , an EU official told me that when he went to Vilnius , Lithuania , for the first time after an earlier posting in Kiev , Ukraine , he " knew immediately " that he was back in a " Western country . " " The religion , the culture , the economics , the society , the architecture , the politics , " he said , were " all basically Western . " From the official 's point of view , therefore , Lithuania 's candidacy for EU admission was already assured , on the basis of informal attitudes formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria . The expectation was already formed that Lithuania would qualify . The issue was no longer " if " but " when . " I have found such informal attitudes on who " belongs " in Europe and who does n't very firmly entrenched all around the continent . <p> In this respect , negative attitudes are as important as positive ones . Here the main targets are often the Turks , followed closely by Albanians , Kosovars , Bosnians , Russians , Belarussians , Ukrainians , Moldovans , Bulgarians , Romanians , Croats , even Serbs . There is , in short , a pecking order of negative stereotypes , as there is of positive ones . Serb hatred of Muslim Albanians , Kosovars , and Bosnians ( and vice versa ) is so intense , it is said , because they are taught it by their mothers . Ancient myths dealing with child-snatching and ritual murder , blood feuds , family hatreds , clean and dirty business deals that go back for generations , past glories and defeats , revenge for old slights real and imagined are resurrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalism , religion , ethnicity , and more and bigger guns . Anyone who thinks that these deep-rooted hatreds , as in Bosnia or Kosovo , will go away soon or can be papered over easily by such simple schemes as , for example , the Dayton Peace Accords does n't know or understand the area . <p> Jokes and stories . There are endless jokes and stories , many of them ethnically based and therefore unrepeatable here , that Eastern and Central Europeans tell about their even more easterly neighbors . Many of them are the same kinds of ethnic jokes that Western Europeans used to tell about the previous " Easterners . " Like everything else , the ethnic joke line in Eastern/Central Europe has just moved slightly farther east . <p> The jokes , as expected , tend to center on the alleged " dumbness " of those across the newly drawn European " border . " People across that eastern or southeastern frontier consistently do stupid things , like sawing off the tree limb on which they are sitting or self-destructing in often crazily romantic and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazily , it is said ; they are lazy and do n't want to work ; they only want to take advantage of the Western countries ' social welfare systems ; they can not organize stable governments ; they are corrupt and dominated by mafias ; their women are all whores and prostitutes ; Easterners ( and Turks ) are said to have strange sex and other habits ; you would not want your daughter to marry one . They ritually kill sheep in their living quarters and then wash the blood down the bathtub drains of public apartment complexes , and so on and so on . <p> Some of these stories are true , some partially true , others demonstrably false ; but all of them are stereotypical and part of popular lore . Educated Americans and Europeans are appalled at the blatant prejudices the stories and stereotypes imply , but the United States often has had similar popular attitudes toward blacks , Hispanics , and immigrants-in part because the immigrants we mainly see , like those in Central Europe , tend to be from the lower classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . From a distance we can easily denounce such attitudes as involving unacceptable ethnic prejudice , but for Europeans the problems they perceive are close by , right next door , or even clearly visible already within their own borders . And as with all such stereotypes that are unfortunately reinforced by socioeconomic and sometimes even racial or ethnic differences , it will likely take three or four generations , not three or four years , as many EU and NATO planners envision , to overcome them . <p> Public opinion surveys . The attitudes-often prejudicial-that I have been informally reporting are bolstered by public opinion surveys. 13 First , Central and Eastern Europe remain strongly committed to democracy . In country after country , support for democracy as the only acceptable system of governance is in the 70-80 percent range . If and when there is slippage from these figures , it is because democracy is perceived as not delivering on its promised social and economic reforms , not because the public prefers some other governmental system . Support for democracy in Central and Eastern Europe is considerably stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . <p> Second and related , support for some other system of government is almost nil . Unlike in Latin America , where the recent decline in support for democracy was accompanied by a parallel rise in support for " strong government " or an authoritarian " out , " voters in East/Central Europe see no such alternative . They certainly do not want an authoritarian or " fascist " solution but they do not want to go back to a Marxist-Leninist regime either . The reasons are pragmatic as well as value-based : to revert now to either a far right or far left regime would almost certainly mean the kiss of death for that country 's chances for NATO or EU admission . When they do vote for communist parties or candidates , it is not usually for ideological reasons but because those parties are seen as better governors , better administrators , or better protectors of the social safety nets of the old regime , which many , especially older Easterners , still prefer to the uncertainties of the private marketplace. 14 <p> With regard to enlargement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps not overly significant . In East/Central Europe the polls show strong ( 50-70 percent depending on the country ) but declining support for joining the European Union . Support for joining NATO is less than that for joining the EU ( in the 30-40 percent range ) , although in most countries support has been rising since NATO stopped its bombing campaigns in Serbia and Kosovo . Most governments have not yet begun to make the case for NATO , and the public has not always seen , or wanted to see , the connection between EU accession , which implies benefits and privileges , and NATO membership , which involves costs and obligations . As regards declining support for EU membership , most analysts see this as similar to the sentiments prevalent in Southern Europe thirty years ago : to the extent that the West embraces East/Central Europe , the East is eager to rejoin the West ; but if the East senses that the West is cooling toward it , then a reaction-formation sets in and the East begins to respond , " Well , we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , until the real invitation comes , and then they will be eager to join . <p> More worrisome are attitudes in the West , in the present EU member states . Immediately after the fall of communism , there was considerable sympathy in the West for bringing the East , including Russia and the CIS , into the fold . Western investment , especially German , Austrian , and Scandinavian , followed on a large scale , not only to help stabilize and democratize Russia but also because the assumption was that Russia and the CIS got socialism ( Stalinist ) wrong the first time , and now the West would help get it right ( social-democratic ) . But then disillusionment set in , the West began seeing Russia and the CIS as unreformable in the short term , and it began reallocating its funds to Europe 's own " near abroad " ( Eastern/Central Europe ) , which not only looked more hopeful economically and politically but also , because of close proximity , had the capacity to affect the West more strongly in the short term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West against admitting East/Central Europe to the EU as well . The issues are complex but they mainly have to do with fears that Eastern immigration will cost jobs in the West , that increased taxes will have to be used to subsidize the less-developed East/Central European economies , that the Eastern countries lack the capacity to control their borders with those countries even farther east ( Belarus and Ukraine , for example-hence , a huge push in the West to retrain the East in border patrol ) , and that Eastern expansion of the EU will bring additional , often unspecified " problems " to the West : rising crime , disease , mafias , prostitution , and so on . On the other hand , the benefits to the West in terms of larger consumer markets for its products and stability and security in the historically volatile East also provide powerful persuasive arguments that governments in the West have not yet begun to emphasize . Plus , the EU is betting that it can assist the East in solving its labor and immigration issues and reach compromises that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion . Once those campaigns are begun and the stakes involved are clearly set forth , then the assumption is that public opinion in the West can be brought around again to favor enlargement . Indeed , many analysts believe that most of these decisions-regarding immigration , the free movement of labor , even enlargement itself-have already been made informally and only await time and a propitious moment to be announced publicly . SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT <p> High levels of socioeconomic development and/or a major economic reform program are , of course , required to be a part of the European club of developed countries and are widely thought to be required for the establishment and consolidation of democracy . In any case the East/Central European countries need to meet the eighty thousand requirements of the Acquis Communautaire if they wish to join the EU . But in this part of the world it seems to be political culture-combined with other factors-that often determines socioeconomic success , at least as much as underlying class or institutional factors. 15 At the least , political culture and socioeconomic development are closely correlated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to answer the chicken-egg question of which came first and was causative in East/Central European development , political culture changes or structural changes ; most likely it is some murky combination of the two , and this may no longer even be an important question , except for historical determinists and true-believer ideologues . <p> Let us take the easy issues first . Number one , if we ask what explains the successful economies of Eastern/Central Europe in the last ten years , the clearest answer , to echo the real estate agent , is Location ! Location ! Location ! 16 By almost every criteria , Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovenia , and Hungary have been Eastern Europe 's leading success stories in the last decade . If we ask why , the most obvious answer is their location next to some of the world 's most prosperous economies such as Germany , Austria , Italy , Scandinavia , and the other EU countries . Not only has there been this rub-off effect from the wealthy Western economies , but a number of the Western countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital to their proximate neighbors in Eastern/Central Europe , with the expectation of far greater and more immediate results . And in terms of protecting their own self-interest , they want prosperous neighbors so that those neighbors solve their own issues of poverty , unemployment , underdevelopment , social problems , and so on , rather than passing them on to the West through immigration and common borders . The situation , although somewhat less extreme in terms of economic disparities , is analogous to that governing U.S.-Mexican relations : it is far better , we have concluded , for Mexico to solve its problems internally with our aid and investment ( hence , the rationale for NAFTA ) rather than pass them on to the United States through immigration . <p> Number two is closely related . Early in the analysis I suggested that the farther east you get from the European heartland of Paris , the less developed , the less modern Eastern and Central Europe become . But the reverse , of course , is also true : the closer you come to the core , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid and trade but for other kinds of effects as well . By that we mean closer contact with Western culture , Western movies and television , Western roads . Western democracies , Western markets , Western ways of doing business , Western institutions ranging from ATMs to McDonald 's , Western social and behavioral mores , Western tourists and ( to come full circle in the argument ) their dollars , francs , pounds , shillings , and deutschmarks . Again , are these factors cultural , structural , or , as seems most likely , some complex overlapping of both ? Compare , for example , the present dynamism and " Westernness " of Warsaw , Prague , or Budapest to the changing but still relatively quieter pace of Bratislava , Sophia , Bucharest , or Zagreb , to say nothing of backward , dreary , and discouraged Kiev , Minsk , Tirana , Chisinau , or Tbilisi , or even Moscow for that matter . Clearly some parts of Eastern and Central Europe are doing far better than others . <p> Let us move now from impressionistic data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to say is how poor many of the countries are . One expects to see shocking poverty in Africa , Latin America , and the Third World but not in East/Central Europe . But in fact parts of East/Central Europe are the Third World . Using GNP per capita , Moldova is close to Haiti 's level as one of the poorest countries in the world ; Albania , Montenegro , and Ukraine all have per capita GNPs of less than $1,000 per person per year , putting them at a level below Central America . None of these is a candidate anytime soon for the EU or NATO . Nor , at least immediately , are Romania , Bulgaria , or Macedonia-each still less than $2,000 per person per year and about at the level of Guatemala . When we get up in the $2,000 to $3,000 range , including Latvia , Lithuania , and Turkey , whose per capita incomes are still only one-tenth that of the EU average ( roughly comparable to the disparity between the United States and Mexico ) we begin to see EU candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that economic range . In the $3,000 to $5,000 range , where we also find Brazil , Chile , and Mexico , are the better-qualified countries of Czech Republic , Croatia , Estonia , Hungary , Poland , and Slovakia . The upper end of the scale is represented by Slovenia which , with a per capita income approaching $10,000 , is getting close to the level of the poorest present EU member , Portugal . <p> On the social indexes-life expectancy , adult literacy , urbanization-Eastern and Central Europe come out higher than these Latin American countries . And if we employ the World Bank 's purchasing power parity indexes , which use a formula that builds in the free ( or nearly so ) housing , health care , education , utilities , and services that citizens of the former socialist states received and often still receive , the rankings go up considerably . Nevertheless , even with those adjustments , the richest of the Eastern/Central European nations ( Slovenia , Czech Republic , Hungary ) are still only about at half of the present EU average , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only at about one-fourth or one-fifth the EU average . Clearly , these countries have a lot of catching up to do . They will also receive EU enlargement funds and thus be a drag on the other EU economies for decades to come . The European Union , and especially the taxpayers in its member countries , do not want to subsidize these weaker economies forever and certainly do not want to take on a series of " basket cases . " The large income disparities also explain why the present EU countries remain fearful of the newcomers ' exporting masses of immigrant job seekers as well as other problems to them . <p> One of the curious paradoxes of the East/Central European transitions is that democratization has successfully occurred even while economic levels in most countries of the area have fallen . This is counterintuitive , since one would expect the prospects for democracy to be better in times of rising affluence than decline ; or , as Billie Holiday ( I think ) once put it , " I 've been rich and I 've been poor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development show that , of all the East/Central European countries , a decade after the overthrow of communism , only Poland , Slovenia , and Slovakia had surpassed their 1989 GNP levels . The Czech Republic , Hungary , and Estonia were within a few percentage points of that goal and have probably reached it by now . Elsewhere in Eastern and Southeastern Europe , especially Bulgaria and Romania , the shortfalls as compared to 1989 were between 20 and 30 percent . And in Russia , the CIS , and the war-torn lands of the former Yugoslavia , the figures were nothing short of catastrophic . Russia 's GNP fell by almost 50 percent between 1989 and 1999 , although rising oil prices subsequently boosted Russia 's economy . The moral ( not a glorious one ) of this story is that the countries that are at least breaking even or beginning to show positive gains are also the ones in which democracy is most secure and chances for NATO and EU membership are the best . In countries where economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also insecure and NATO or EU admission is still in the future . Finally , in the catastrophic countries , neither consolidated democracy nor admission to either of Europe 's two key clubs are in the offing anytime soon . <p> The final point to be made in this section is how closely these social and economic indicators correspond to the political culture and other variables already presented . Slovenia , Czech Republic , Hungary , Slovakia , Poland , Estonia , Croatia , Lithuania , Latvia are the wealthiest , most developed countries in Eastern/Central Europe , in that order . They are also the ones closest to the main centers of West European prosperity ; all are Christian and " Western " ; all are more or less unified ethnically or at least without serious separatist movements or the potential for civil war ; all are democratic not only electorally but in terms of real substance , change , and reform as well . They are also , not coincidentally , the leading candidates for admission either to NATO or the EU or both . Perhaps not surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , Westernness , and acceptability within NATO and the EU all go together. 17 DEMOCRACY/HUMAN RIGHTS <p> Democracy and human rights , along with economic reform leading to growth , have become the sine qua non for admission to both NATO and the EU . But democracy can be defined in a number of ways . At least four definitions come into play in assessing the countries of Eastern and Central Europe . <p> The first , easiest , and most widely accepted definition of democracy is regular , competitive , fair elections that lead to periodic , peaceful transfers of power . This is usually referred to as the institutional definition of democracy . It is widely used in academic as well as foreign policy circles because it provides the easiest way to call a country democratic and thereby to qualify it for aid and cooperation . By this criterion , since they have all had elections , all the countries of East/Central Europe ( including Belarus , Ukraine , Georgia , Moldova , and Russia , and now Serbia and Croatia ) may be called democratic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " electoral " democracy . The criticism is that it is relatively easy to engineer elections ( look at Belarus , Moldova , Ukraine ) , but real , meaningful democracy implies considerably more than that . Hence , the second definition , often called " real " or " liberal " democracy , emphasizes the actual practices and political culture of democracy beyond elections , including civil discourse , respect for the opinions of others , presumptions of equality , military subordination to civilian authority , free press and other classic freedoms , pluralism of interest groups , respect for minorities , and so on . Countries that fall into this category include the Baltic republics , Poland , Czech Republic , Hungary , and Slovenia . Others ( Slovakia , Bulgaria , Romania , Croatia ) are struggling with those criteria ; still others ( Serbia , Bosnia ) have so far made little democratic progress beyond formal elections ; some ( Moldova , Belarus , Ukraine , maybe Russia ) have slipped backward . <p> A third definition is not so much a distinct definition but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature is its focus on what are often called " second-stage " or " second-generation " reforms , including judicial reform , anticorruption measures , police reform , and transparency in the management of public accounts . These reforms are second stage or second generation in that they imply a long-term political/economic reform process that comes after the first stage involving elections and the initial granting of new political freedoms . Second-stage reforms may also involve the growth of civil society and the further consolidation of democratic reforms , continued economic reforms and privatization , modernization of education , bureaucracy , and so on . Significantly , all of the EU and NATO candidate countries are now at various places in this stage , having already qualified in terms of the democratic basics of definitions 1 and 2 , and are now seeking to fill all the complex technical and reform criteria that the two great European clubs impose as conditions of membership . <p> A fourth and final definition involves human rights . Clearly this issue is interwoven with the previous three ; it also stands by itself in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address most , if not all , of the classic human rights-press , assembly , speech , religion . Currently the human rights criteria are employed frequently to criticize transgressions by applicant countries in East/Central Europe with regard to treatment of national minorities , especially the Roma . Cynical observers interpret this as the EU countries ' telling the applicant countries to treat their minorities well and with respect so that , once enlargement occurs and border restrictions fall , those minorities will not flood en masse to the Western countries. 18 Once more it is the Baltic countries , Poland , Czech Republic , Hungary , Slovenia , and Slovakia that score the highest on human rights criteria . <p> The criteria used here for classifying countries as democracies are the " freedom scores " issued by Freedom House on a yearly basis for each of the world 's countries. 19 The scores represent the averages of ratings on political and civil rights ; scores range from 1 ( best ) to 7 ( worst ) . There are drawbacks to this methodology but it is a reasonably accurate way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it encompasses electoral rights and the meaningfulness of elections , real procedural rights and practices , second-generation reforms , and human rights . On this as on a number of the criteria raised here , hypocrisy is frequently involved , meaning that the Western countries are not necessarily models in these areas either . <p> Here , we sort our countries into four categories . Category 1 includes those countries that received the highest scores of 1 or 1.5 in the Freedom House surveys . In 1996-97 , countries in Category 1 , all with scores of 1.5 , were Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Lithuania , Poland , and Slovenia . Their scores were the same as those received by Belgium , Germany , the United Kingdom , and Italy and , for comparison purposes , were one-half point ahead of Chile 's , Israel 's , and South Korea 's . Although the possibility of backsliding or a reversion to authoritarianism exists in several of these countries , that possibility seems increasingly remote . Not only would such slippage violate domestic public opinion in those countries but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission . By the year 2001 those countries had remained democratic , and they had been joined by Latvia and Slovakia , the latter of which showed dramatic improvement after a change of government in 1998 . The 2001 Freedom House ratings for Central and Eastern Europe are shown in table 2 . <p> Category 2 consists of countries that received scores of 2 to 4 in the Freedom House surveys , meaning that they seemed at the time to be moving toward greater democracy . These included Georgia , Latvia , Moldova , Romania , and Turkey . Since that earlier survey Latvia has , as indicated , moved up to a top position in the rankings ; Romania has stayed the same at 2.0 ; and Georgia and Moldova have stagnated or slipped rather badly . Meanwhile , Bulgaria and Croatia have moved out of a lower category to join the good/improving group . <p> Category 3 consists of countries that already in the mid-1990s , despite earlier hopes , experienced an erosion of democracy , ranging from mild to severe . Mild erosion ( one-half point loss ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Severe erosion ( one full point ) took place in Albania , Belarus , and Slovakia . But since that time , as we have seen , significant democratic improvement has occurred in Bulgaria , Croatia , and Slovakia ; the others have stagnated or deteriorated further . <p> Finally , Category 4 consists of countries that by the mid-1990s had simply moved from one form of authoritarianism to another , without substantial democratization . These countries are Bosnia and Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) . But with the Dayton Peace Accords and a massive aid program for Bosnia , and with Milosevic now out of power in Yugoslavia , those countries are also moving up in the rankings and may join the more hopeful group . Meanwhile , Albania ( 4.5 ) , Belarus ( 6.5 ) , Russia ( 5.0 ) , and Ukraine ( 4.5 ) should probably be placed in this lowest category . <p> What is striking about this classification scheme is the increased division between countries that are " making it " to democracy and freedom and those that are not , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Latvia , and Slovakia moving up , the " democratic " category has been expanded . It now includes the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Slovenia , and Slovakia . The only countries left in the middle are Bulgaria , Romania , Croatia , Turkey , and now possibly Bosnia and Yugoslavia . At the same time Russia and the CIS countries ( Belarus , Georgia , Moldova , Ukraine ) have stagnated or moved down . Significantly , this is precisely the lineup of likely admission to the EU and NATO : the first or democratic group is probably " in " ; the second or intermediate group sits and waits as also-rans , with the potential for future admission ; the third group ( both those who have slipped significantly and those who never really transitioned away from authoritarianism ) is " out . " Note how closely the categories correspond to the indicators for the other criteria of " Europeanness " that we have been considering . INSTITUTIONALIZATION <p> Another criterion for determining who makes it into the EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic . There is much that can be said on this subject ; let me briefly make the major points . <p> First , we need to distinguish between two groups . On one hand are states that have had a considerable history as independent nations and therefore have some history of nationalism and national identity , including a national political culture , a national bureaucracy , decision making , policy implementation , and the experience of living and working together as both a state and a people . On the other hand are the entities for whom those traits are either lacking or are so new as to be noninstitutionalized . Historian Lonnie R , Johnson has this distinction in mind when he categorizes states as either " historical " or " nonhistorical. " 20 By " historical nations " he means states that can identify their own historical origins in the form of a kingdom or state in the past , such as Poland , Czech Republic , Croatia , Hungary , Serbia , and Bulgaria . " Nonhistorical " nations are peoples who have had submerged , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , territory , or historical continuity , such as Slovaks , Slovenes , Bosnians , Macedonians , Belarussians , Ukrainians , or Georgians . " In-between " states , such as Albania , Romania , and the Baltic countries , have had less history than the former but generally more history than the latter . Recognizing that the point needs further elaboration and that the correlations are not 1:1 , we can nevertheless say that the historical and in-between states generally show greater prospects for political stability , democracy , institutionalization , and thus integration into Europe than those states that at present are struggling to create viable state structures and national institutions for really the first time . <p> Second , we examine the political-economy sphere . During the cold war , policy analysts seldom differentiated sharply among the various Warsaw Pact countries , assuming that all communist economies functioned more or less the same . But with the end of the cold war we have become increasingly aware of the need to disaggregate countries and recognize that the old assumptions of similarity were misleading . For example , Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were countries of tremendous buoyancy and dynamism , of a long and deep sense of rebelliousness , of small acts of protest and revolt ( work slowdowns , sabotage , refusal to conform ) , and of a sense that " you ca n't keep us down forever . " Politically they had powerful legacies of dissent , opposition , punk groups , even a gay movement in otherwise repressive Slovenia-all as expressions of dissatisfaction with Soviet occupation and communist rule . They also had partly decentralized and liberalized before the Berlin Wall fell , enabling groups such as Poland 's Solidarity and the Czech Republic 's Civic Forum to organize and form a base for later democracy . <p> Economically , the Poles , Czechs , and Hungarians , drawing on their experience with markets before World War II , as well as the fact that they had been less completely socialized than other communist countries , lost little time after the collapse of communism in resuming entrepreneurial activities , opening shops and commercial ventures , hustling for money , devising new commercial codes , reorganizing banking and credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in much of Belarus , Ukraine , Georgia , Moldova , to say nothing of Russia and Central Asia , there is neither such a historical legacy of free entrepreneurial activity nor the pool of skills for either grassroots democracy or a flourishing market economy . It is no accident that the former countries were the first to join NATO and will probably be among the first to be admitted to the EU , whereas the latter , still mired in political authoritarianism and economic distress , stand no chance of being integrated into Europe anytime soon . <p> A third institutional indicator is civil society . Here our markers are less clear . Poland 's Solidarity is cited as the classic case of how a strong , popularly based civil society organization can be the essential base both to oust a dictatorship and to establish democracy . The Czech Republic 's Civic Forum is similarly cited , although its composition and the history and process of democratization there were quite different from Poland 's . Hungary had already liberalized its regime from within , though it lacked a single , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the evidence indicates that since the early 1990s when these transitions began , the civil society movements in these countries have declined , atrophied , and fragmented . So the evidence leads us to speculate : Is a civil society movement necessary only in the early stages of the transition , after which it disappears ? Is American-style , pluralist , " Tocquevillian " civil society necessary for the maintenance of democracy or are there other systems of state-society relations emerging in East/Central Europe , and if so , what are they ? Meanwhile , we also know that those countries , especially in the Balkans , the CIS , and Russia , that lacked and still lack any well-established system of independent civil society , whether in the short or longer run , have had and will have a harder time securing and consolidating democracy . CONCLUSION <p> Early in the 1990s , after the Berlin Wall had fallen , the Iron Curtain had come down , and the Soviet Union had disintegrated , there was a great deal of optimistic talk , in the West and East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals : the geographic definition of Europe . It has not worked out that way . <p> A new divide , often referred to as the Golden Curtain , is stretching across Europe to replace the old and torn-down iron one . The new curtain has been designated " golden " because it separates the wealthier countries , or countries that are " making it " into the ranks of the affluent-Croatia , Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Slovenia , and Slovakia-from those who are also-rans or mired in poverty and underdevelopment . The first group , with qualifications , is also democratic ; in the present decade all or most of the countries are likely to be integrated into the EU and NATO . The rest have not yet made it or , worse , may be condemned to seemingly permanent exclusion from Europe . <p> The new curtain being drawn across Europe seems , at least in theory , to be more flexible than the old one . There is a wall , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barbed wire , or armed guards-although with Europe 's strict new border ( Schengen ) rules and patrols , the differences may not appear so great . Theoretically , it is possible for Russia and the CIS states to qualify for admission to NATO and the European Union ; the EU says that it wants no new " artificial " barriers across Europe , and there are ongoing ( though declining ) cooperative programs . But the gaps between about-to-be member and nonmember states are widening rather than narrowing and are likely in the future to get wider still . Through its relations first with the new NATO applicants , then ( moving eastward ) with the CIS , with GUUAM ( Georgia , Ukraine , Uzbekistan , Azerbaijan , Moldova ) , with the Black Sea Economic Cooperation project , with Central Asia , and finally with Russia itself , NATO seems to have erected a formidable hierarchy of groupings , associations , and defenses aimed more at hemming in , isolating , and weakening Russia than bringing new states into the fold ( which may in fact all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO is theoretically open to still further expansions besides those currently contemplated or already under way , the practical likelihood of bringing any more than a handful of present also-rans ( Bulgaria , Romania , Croatia , Serbia ) into the European fold ( which would thus in effect " complete " the borders of Europe ) seems remote . Russia , the CIS countries , and Central Asia are at present hardly even contemplated as potential members . <p> EU and NATO accession requirements are similar and to a considerable extent parallel ( democracy , human rights , economic reform , institutional modernization ) , but they are not coterminous , the reverse side of the same coin . Most countries who instigate reforms aimed at EU admission are also making reforms that help qualify them for NATO . On the other hand , NATO , with its Partnership for Peace program , various cooperative programs , joint exercises , and numerous " halfway houses " on the way to NATO , has so far been considerably more imaginative , flexible , and forthcoming on the issue of enlargement than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to antagonize the aspirant countries and led to declining support within them for EU accession . Part of this is the result of a conscious delaying strategy on the part of the EU , part of it reflects the higher political and economic costs ( real money ! ) for membership in the EU than in the NATO club , and part of it is due to more efficient , streamlined , rational planning for NATO enlargement on the part of a single actor ( essentially the U.S. Defense Department ) , as compared with the EU 's complex , multilayered , multinational decision making . Moreover , the relations between the EU and NATO are also complex , layered , and represent at some levels a single , U.S.-dominated decision-making process rather than " parallel tracks , " an image that is often used to picture them . Meanwhile , from the point of view of the East/Central European countries , membership in these exclusive clubs represents confirmation of their postcommunist success , growth , democratic stability , Westernness , and even civilization . <p> What emerges most clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being drawn across Europe , but how closely the line corresponds to the historic sense of Europe as encompassing Western , developed , Christian Europe . In the age of political correctness , such themes are not often expressed , but they are so obvious that they jump off the page . These dividing lines were more or less established a thousand years ago ; even with all the fluctuations of history over the centuries , the wars and invasions and conquests , not much has changed since then . Christian Europe is part of the new Europe ; Orthodox Europe is marginal ; Muslim Europe is out . Central Europe still lags economically and sociologically behind the West , but it is far ahead of the Russian or CIS East . The Baltic countries and Central Europe are in ; Russia and its historic constituent units ( Belarus , Ukraine , Georgia , Moldova ) are out . The new lines being drawn in Central Europe are almost exactly the same borders as those of the historic Austro-Hungarian Empire , with Western Ukraine , Transylvania , northern Serbia ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farthest or " military frontiers " of that empire . <p> My purpose in this article , in focusing on religious , political , institutional , developmental , and cultural fault lines , is not to be overly determinist . We need to keep our minds , and Europe 's rules , open to the possibilities for Europe 's continued expansion . For this is , as British writer Martin Walker reminds us , also an existential question , not only of what Europe is but also of what it might be , and whether it can summon the political will to keep the enlargement process going. 21 For many of the borders talked of here are vague , flexible boundaries . And countries and peoples , after all , can and do change : witness the dramatic economic growth and democratization in Eastern and Central Europe itself in the last decade , in countries that we once considered forever " lost " to communism . Moreover , it seems to me that the way to solve the manifold problems of the Balkans , Turkey , the Commonwealth of Independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new " curtains " that forever exclude them from Europe , but to bring them in over time , to incorporate them into Europe in some fashion , though not necessarily through the EU , to give them hope and a shot at democracy and economic development , to devise new halfway houses ( associate rather than full membership ) that offer the prospect at least of change and modernization . That prospect is scary as well as costly to today 's Europeans , which is why they are presently drawing the boundaries as portrayed here ; but in the long run it is the only way to provide a measure of peace and stability in the areas farther to the east . For now , however , it is the closer border that is the realistic and operable one . <p> To that hallowed question of where Europe ends , therefore , the answer in 2001 is a little firmer in terms of national boundaries than it was in the past . It ends along the Golden Curtain I have been describing , which is as much cultural and historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and informal answer , " Somewhere south-or southeast-of Vienna , " also still applies . It appears , therefore , that not all that much has changed over the last millennium . Do geography , history , and political culture , therefore , still count ? Absolutely . Are these factors determinative or , alternatively , accommodative to new countries and ways of doing things ? That is now the harder question that can only be decided in the future . <p>
