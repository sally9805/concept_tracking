People who know a little about naval history will tell you that the first ironclad warships since the Koreans employed their turtle ships against the Japanese in 1593 were USS Monitor and CSS Virginia , in 1862 . People who know a little more will say that the first modem ironclad was the French Gloire in 1859 . Both claims are wrong . Gloire was the first seagoing steam-powered ironclad ; Monitor and Virginia were the first ironclads to fight one another . But the first ironclads to see action since the 1590s were French batteries during the Crimean War . The French batteries were hardly triumphs of ingenuity like Monitor . They were limited ships for limited use , crude-looking , slow and clumsy . Still , when they opened fire at the Russian forts in 1855 and when the first enemy shots glanced off their sides , the ratchet wheel of progress clicked around another notch . Iron-hulled merchant ships had been around for decades , but navies had been slow to use iron for warships .

Then the French brought in heavy , shell-firing guns in the 1830s , which could set broken timbers on fire . Although iron would not bum , exploding shells could knock it to splinters , too . Shell-firing guns went onto wooden battleships ' main decks , with solid shot-firing guns on the decks above . They were tried in action in 1853 at Sinope on the Black Sea , where a Russian battle squadron destroyed a Turkish squadron of frigates and corvettes . Although naval writers have come to count Sinope as proof that the day of the wooden warship was finally over , few people seem to have seen it that way at the time , since the Russian naval force had the advantage of overwhelming numbers as well as the shell guns . When Britain and France went to war with Russia in 1854 , all three powers still had big fleets of wooden battleships . Most British steam battleships attacked the Russians in the Baltic , and a mixed squadron of steamers and sailing ships went to the Black Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peninsula . Russia 's admirals were not keen to take on the two most powerful navies in the world . The Russian Baltic Fleet spent the whole war in harbor , under close blockade in the Gulf of Finland . The Black Sea Fleet scuttled itself in port as soon as the allied fleet hove into sight , and its sailors served ashore in the trenches . On October 17,1854 , the powerful allied fleet bombarded Sebastopol , but the Russian forts and batteries stood up well to the attack , and the allies suffered about 300 casualties . A week later , the Russian army in the north of the Crimea attacked at Balaclava but failed to raise the siege of Sebastopol , which dragged on through a bitter winter . In May 1855 , the Royal Navy struck at Russia 's supply line in the Sea of Azov , north of the Crimea . Light craft sank four Russian steam warships and more than 200 merchant ships , forcing the Russians to convey all their supplies to the front by land . Sebastopol fell on September 9,1855 . Czar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new czar , Alexander II , was looking for peace . The allies thought they had already achieved as much as they were going to , but neither side wanted to lose face by seeming too eager to end the conflict . None of the allied generals wanted to chase the Russian army all the way back to Moscow Instead , they studied the Russian defenses at Kinburn , at the mouth of the Bug River , northwest of the Crimea . They reasoned that a naval bombardment followed by an infantry landing would give them a beachhead only a day 's march from the big Russian naval yard at Nikolayev . Its capture would be a handy bargaining point when the Russians came to the peace table . The French had another motive to attack Kinburn . Their fleet in the Black Sea had just taken delivery of three brand-new steam batteries , hurriedly coated with thick iron armor plating after the war broke out . The French wanted to see how the ironclads would perform in battle , and Kinburn looked like their last chance . The French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their emperor , Napoleon III , liked to keep himself up to date on naval science , and when the French Admiralty pulled the ironclad plans out and dusted them off in 1854 , he ordered five of them laid down on September 5 . With France already at war , the emperor 's dockyards did n't try anything too clever or experimental . Their design was plain and serviceable , quick and easy to build . Maybe they were in too much of a hurry to measure as they were going , because different books list different hull dimensions , varying from 164 to 172 feet long , 42 1/2 or 44 feet in beam , 8 or 9 feet in draught . One account says they displaced 1,400 tons , others say they were bigger than the 1,500-ton Palestro , built a few years later . // Three innovative ironclad floating batteries prove their worth , in this French illustration of the bombardment of the Russian fort at Kinburn on October 17 , 1855. // Their hulls were timber , with a layer of 4 1/2-inch iron plating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very blunt in form . The battery sides sloped inward from the waterline , which saved some top weight , although the slope was only about 18 degrees from vertical-not enough to deflect enemy shot . Each battery fired solid shot from 18 50  --  pounder smoothbore guns , roofed over by a deck of stout teak , plated with iron . The battery and machinery spaces were fed fresh air by big fans . Many pundits thought this system looked too tricky to work well , and they predicted the crews would be stifled by heat , foul air and powder smoke . The helmsmen of each battery stood in a box of bullet-proof iron , with a voice-pipe to the engine-room . The steam engines were rated at about 150 horsepower , and with low  --  pressure boilers they drove a single screw . At first the French gave the craft a light sailing rig , but during sea trials the broad , shallow hulls handled badly , and they were fitted with pole masts instead . Napoleon had the battery plans sent on to London . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250-ton gunboats to get at the Russians in coastal waters , was not sure it would need ironclad batteries . On the other hand , though Russia was the current enemy , the French were Britain 's regular , long-term rivals . If France had steam ironclad batteries , the British Admiralty decided that it had better have some , too . The builders of the four British batteries stuck pretty close to the French plan . They considered triple screws for more thrust , but time was pressing , and in the end they did it the French way , with only one . The French launched their lead ship , Tonnante , at Brest in March 1855 , and Congreve , Lave , Foudroyante and Devastation were afloat by July The French navy did n't waste much time on trials , and steam frigates towed them off to Kamiesch Bay , where the allied admirals mustered six British and four French battleships and a powerful collection of cruisers , gunboats , mortar-boats and transports . By that time the British ironclad batteries were completed and also on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . The combined fleet sailed on October 7 , 1855 , with 10,000 soldiers to make the landing . Kinburn was 400 miles from Kamiesch , and they made a slow passage . On October 8 , allied ships showed themselves off Odessa , 40 miles west of Kinburn , in an attempt to distract the Russians from the true target . Once the Russians had been distracted enough , the ships steamed across the bay to Kinburn . The forts stood on a long , narrow , sandy spit between the estuary bay of the Bug and Dneiper rivers and the open water of the Black Sea . The main fort was the southernmost . It was square , made of stone , with heavy guns mounted on barbettes and in casemates . A circular stone fort stood slightly to the north , and a thick-sided earthwork stood north of that . All three forts commanded the channel into the bay . Under the allied plan of attack , the ironclads would fire from a line of buoys about 600 yards southwest of the main fort . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , on the ironclads ' starboard quarter . While the battleships and ironclads fired on the main fort , the frigates , corvettes and gunboats would engage the other two . The mortar-boats would lie farther out to lob their bombs . On the night of October 14 , British and French gunboats ran up the channel past the forts , into the long bay behind them . The Russian gunners banged away at them without doing any damage . The first allied troops landed three miles south of the main fort on the following morning . Now the forts were cut off : To the east , the allied soldiers blocked the land approach along the spit . To the west and south , allied battleships commanded the sea . To the north , the gunboats controlled the bay . The Russians upriver at the Nikolayev dockyard did n't try to interfere , and those in the forts stayed where they were . On the evening of October 16 , the French frigate Valoreux and some French and British gunboats tested their mettle against the forts for half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians fired back with great spirit , but their aim was poor . As before , they did no damage to the ships . Their shells seemed to be poorly fused-many burst in the air short of their targets . That night , a French boat rowed in close to the forts to take soundings and lay the buoys to guide the ironclads . At dawn on October 17 the French troops ashore started digging their siege trenches 600 yards from the main fort 's walls , and their artillery exchanged fire with the stronghold 's guns . Meanwhile , offshore , the combined fleet was ready . The sea was calm , and there was a northerly breeze . The allied gunboats were able to stand in and start pounding the Russian works with shellfire . At 7 a.m. , Devastation , Lave and Tonnante raised steam . Two hours later , both sides watched with great interest as they moved up to their firing points . French and British sailors were keen to see them put to the test , and by this time their design could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forts opened fire early at long range , but most shots missed and the rest glanced off the armor . The batteries reached the buoys and nosed around into the current to anchor . At about 9:30 a.m. , they all opened fire . The gunboats and mortar-boats went on firing , and the battleships joined in , firing at an angle past the rear of the batteries ' line . Devastation and her sisters were firing 12-gun broadsides , with three guns from each ship 's unengaged side firing through spare ports to starboard . The stone fort was an easy target for the batteries , and the batteries were easy targets for the fort . The French gunners , sweating in smoke and darkness under the iron decks , heard shot after shot clang against their armor like blows from a gigantic hammer . Sailors in other ships nearby saw round shot bounce off the plating and splash into the sea . The batteries took a few casualties when the odd 18- or 32-pounder shot whizzed in at a gun port or struck splinters at a port 's rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fort 's masonry apart . Marines lined the upper decks of the batteries , picking off Russian gunners . Russian guns started falling silent , knocked off their carriages by direct hits . Allied observers could see the whole face of the fort starting to crumble under the hammering . Heavy shell-guns in the British gunboats were adding to the damage , and bombs from allied mortars were starting fires inside . After four hours of pounding , all the forts were silent . The allied admirals discussed a cease-fire , but after one last French broadside , the white flag went up over Kinburn at 1:35 p.m . Allied officers were soon able to land to assess the damage . Out of 62 guns and mortars in the square stone fort , 29 had been knocked out by the fleet 's fire . Russian losses were 45 men killed and about 130 wounded . The French decided that most of the damage had been done by the big guns in the ironclad batteries , firing at the shortest range . The allies had lost two men killed and 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devastation had taken the most damage-a Russian ball had passed clean through a gun port amidships , beheading a gunner , striking a sergeant of marines in the stomach , and lodging in the timbers of the ship 's far side . Another gunner had three long sponges shattered in his grasp , one of ter the other , yet he came out of the engagement unhurt . Devastation sustained 31 hits on her side and 44 on her deck . She was dented all over , but none was more than an inch and a half deep . Lave and Tannante had each been hit about 60 times . After that sort of punishment , all three were still fit to steam into action again . The Russians had not done any serious harm to any floating battery 's structure , and they had not shot away any fittings that mattered . Only five shots had even cracked the French armor . Damage and casualties among the battleships , frigates and lighter craft were even slighter , but that was only because the Russians had marked the ironclads as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every gun that would bear , virtually leaving the wooden ships alone . For the main body of the fleet , the action had been like target practice , which made for an interesting comparison with the bombardment of Sebastopol a year before . At Sebastopol , the British ships lost 44 men killed and 266 wounded , the French lost 30 killed and 164 wounded . Two British ships and six French were badly damaged . The Sebastopol forts were battered but unbeaten , and when the ships fell back they were admitting failure . Kinburn 's forts were n't as strong as Sebastopol's-but even if they had been as strong or stronger , the ironclad batteries most likely would have been a match for them . As it was , with Sebastopol and Kinburn both in allied hands , there was n't much left in the Crimea for the batteries to shoot at . For the next few months they helped blockade Nikolayev , and the war dragged on through another winter while the Russians steeled themselves to admit defeat . The peace treaty was signed in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not build a new fleet for the Black Sea and they would let Turkey alone in future . Nobody thought they would honor that pledge forever , but it was not a bad result for the allies for the time being . The French press gave most of the credit to Napoleon III . " The Emperor had previously famished France with a pattern of artillery which played a very material part in the victories of the Alma , of Inkerman and of Traktar , " Le Moniteur said . " He has now endowed the Navy with an arm which has only just made its appearance , and which in its future career will prove its power . " After the Crimean War there was a pause in ironclad development . The French had five armored batteries afloat ; the Royal Navy had eight . The Royal Navy 's second batch-Erna , Erebus , Terror and Thunderbolt-was built with iron hulls . Both navies went on with programs of wooden battleships while they continued tests with big guns and armor . In 1858 , the French laid down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the Admiralty laid down HMS Warrior , 9,600 tons , the following year , and the next naval building race was underway After the Erna class , no more British ironclad steam batteries were built . The French built a few more batches of batteries for local defense , but after 1862 they , too , gave up . The Italians built half a dozen , mostly ship-shaped and rigged for sea service . These were used in the battle line against the Austro-Hungarian fleet at Lissa in 1866 , and one , Palestro , caught fire and blew up . Most of the broadside ironclads in the American Civil War can be considered armored steam batteries . The best of them was the Union 's New Ironsides , and she was a lot like the Italian models . The Brazilians used small riverine steam batteries in their war against Paraguay between 1865 and 1870 . The steam battery was eventually surpassed in naval use by the turreted monitor . Monitors were more expensive , more complicated and at least as unseaworthy but they could carry bigger guns behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked purposeful and scientific . Armored batteries looked primitive and awkward . Cheap as they were , armored steam batteries were not a very good value . Armor plating was , however . Seen in retrospect , it had to come into use sooner or later , and Kinburn had been a good place to try it . The tally of Russian hits , the slight damage and the small casualty list all proved its case beyond argument . <p>
