The best way for Don Mitchell to describe this moment was that it felt like clawing up a wall of loose dirt while standing in a pool of quicksand . How many more times would he set himself up for heartache and disappointment ? Once the recommendation was handed down from the almighty Dave Mitchell , the one whose bloodline he shared , the board of directors wasted no time in fulfilling the directive . Six votes in favor , two opposed , with one abstention . As easy as that , little brother Joel , barely out of diapers and teething rings , was running the company . Twentythree years old . Don sat quietly with no retort , unlike his mother , Madeline , who wanted a recount . He slowly packed his belongings , trying not to make eye contact with the board members as they scattered from the room amidst a cloud of chit chatter , with his mother in relentless pursuit , nipping at their heels and hurling accusations . <p> To onlookers , the vote was a simple executive decision . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the veil of affection he 'd worked so hard to keep mended with his father . Every time a bud of kinship sprang forth in their relationship , some unforeseen act squashed the bonding . This time he was n't four years old , crying himself to sleep for a father who was n't coming home . He was a thirty-one-year-old man who was n't looking to be fathered . He was n't even looking to be loved , the basic benefit that should have come freely from his father at birth . At this point , a dash of respect would be sufficient , yet it continued eluding him . <p> His mother came back into the room after chasing everyone else away . " Do n't you worry , " she consoled with a pat on the back . " I 'm not going to stand for this . You are the rightful heir to your father 's company . I do n't know what your father and that little conniving gold-digging wife of his were thinking , but when I 'm through with them , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the last thing I do . Sherry 's not getting her hands on anything else of mine and that includes your place as head of this organization . When your father was only working with a handful of churches , I was there , back when he was struggling to make the leadership training ministry a viable business . Now that DMI is worth more than a billion dollars , she wants it , too . I ca n't lose everything to her , not again , not without a fight . I mean a real war this time . " Her voice faded for a second , but Don could tell his mother was putting on a brave face guarded by a steel disposition . Others saw her as a shrewd businesswoman , but his image of her was padded by the countless childhood memories he had of her crying when she thought no one was looking . Loss after loss spread over two decades was bound to wear her down . <p> Don reflected on his options . This would be the time when a practical person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No need . He already knew the source of his problem , and it began with his birth . " Mother , it 's done , " he said while fumbling with the stack of papers in his portfolio . " Dave Mitchell made his choice , " he said , hesitating , " and it was n't me . " He braced both hands against the giant mahogany table and let his head bow with eyes closed . " It never is . " When Dave Mitchell gave away his favorite classic Porsche , the one Don dreamed of owning , the car went to Joel . When his father needed someone from DMI to represent him at the international summit of leaders , Don was n't chosen . In his mind , he never was . <p> " Don , do n't you worry . I 'll take care of this . I 'm going to see your father right now . He has to answer to me . I might not be in a full-time marketing role any longer , but I 'm still on the board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , pausing for a moment , regaining strength in her voice . " I 've helped keep this place running . There 's no way I 'm going to stand by and let that woman and your father destroy you . It wo n't happen again . Dave owes me . He has to do right by at least one of my children , and you 're the only one I have left . " <p> Steering clear of the conversation surrounding his siblings was the best approach to take with his mother , given the fresh layer of defeat she was experiencing yet again at the hands of Dave and Sherry Mitchell . " Mother , do n't bother . " Every time there was peace and a chance for his mother to consider releasing the anger she harbored about the divorce , something new came up to make her madder . Felt like every year or at least every other year there was new trouble with Sherry and Dave , making the divorce seem as if it was yesterday  --  plenty of fresh cuts on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof . <p> Don 's heart sank deeper , which he did n't think possible . Madeline was a good mother . Commitment to her family was undeniable . She was sixty-two . He wanted her to begin living her life outside the clutches of Dave and Sherry , but he did n't know how to help her make the transition when he could n't help himself . <p> She squeezed his shoulder tight and pushed her cheek next to his . " Too late , darling , I 'm already on my way to see your father . I 'll talk with you later . " <p> Don blew out a deep breath as he watched his mother leave the boardroom . He wanted to be demanding and stop her from confronting his father . On the other hand , he wanted someone to do something , but in the end he knew no one could . Even at this moment , he could n't garner enough contempt to hate his father . There were many reasons why he could , but his heart would n't take the plunge into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shot-caller , had dubbed baby brother Joel top dog and that was the end of it . No sense fretting any longer . He might as well go and congratulate the chosen one . Don plucked his portfolio from the table and went into the hallway , where he ran into Joel . He had n't expected to see the new leader quite so soon . <p> " Don , " Joel said , panting for breath , " I got this envelope from Dad 's office . I 'm supposed to cast this vote in his absence . " <p> " Too late , little brother , the vote has already been taken and everyone is gone . " <p> " But I did n't get to cast Dad 's vote , " Joel said , holding the small sealed envelope . <p> " Did n't need to , little brother , nope , no need at all , " he said letting his glance graze the floor before mustering enough dignity to regain eye contact with his father 's favorite . " Dave Mitchell 's vote was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're the new chief executive officer . " <p> " Me  --  what are you talking about ? I thought you wanted the job . " <p> " I did , but the position was n't offered to me , " Don said . <p> The enthusiasm in Joel 's eyes fizzled . Maybe he was shocked and remorseful or maybe he really was that selfish spoiled-rotten kid who was good at pretending to be sincere when it benefited him . Either way , Don would maintain a semblance of dignity . He planted his feet solidly , pleading unsuccessfully with his soul not to let an inkling of his disappointment be exposed , not to run the risk of giving Joel extra gratification . " That 's right . You 're the new man in charge . You were chosen to run his business , " Don said , and let the realization have a few moments to soak in . " The board went along with it , although I 'm the oldest and the most legitimate . " <p> Don was very familiar with the controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's marriage to Sherry and the birth of their son Joel . Right or wrong , Joel was obviously loved enough to gain control of their father 's prized possession without merit . <p> Joel took a step back . <p> Don felt good letting the wind out of the chosen one 's sails , but the innuendo about Joel 's legitimacy must have stirred a hornet 's nest , judging by the cutting look he was giving . It seemed best to calm the brooding waters before the awkward conversation got out of hand . " I 'm not trying to say that you stole my position . I 'm not saying that at all . " <p> " Then what are you saying , Don ? I had nothing to do with this decision . This came from our father . I do n't know why he chose me , but he must have a reason , " Joel said , his back stiffening . <p> Conscious of the escalating tension , Don quickly acted to defuse it . " If our father and Sherry deem you the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way it is . " <p> " Leave my mother out of this . " <p> " That 's pretty hard to do . " Before Joel became too defensive , Don shifted the focus back to the business . " Regardless of whose decision this is , I 'm willing to support you as the head of this organization . " He heard the words squeak through his teeth and wondered from where they 'd come . They sounded good , the right words to say . If only they were true . " Do you want me to stay on as senior vice president managing the East Coast ? " <p> " I do n't see why not . Obviously Father wants you in the role . Why should n't I ? " <p> Don was a half-smashed bug under Joel 's feet , hoping the crushing weight would leave enough of his ego intact for him to crawl away , balancing a load of dejection on his back . This was n't his brother . His real brothers were dead . Joel was no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as much gratitude as his pride would allow and slung it at his father 's son for the extended grace . " Great , that 's good to hear . So this means I 'll keep my office on the East Coast and stay out of your way . The rest of the country is all yours , yours and that mother of yours . " <p> " Don , " Joel raised his voice and spewed , " you are welcome to stay on , so long as you leave my mother out of this . " <p> The passive approach was n't working . Don had to harness his disapproval in Joel 's presence . Before he could move two more feet , the new leader threw more words his way . <p> " Because if you do n't , " Joel hurled at him , completing the message by jerking his closed fist and extended thumb backward over his shoulder before snarling , " brother or not , you 'll have to leave . " <p> In the silence , Don let his glaring eyes meet Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was duly received . Any room for misinterpretation was eliminated . Joel 's need to defend Sherry was n't surprising . After all , the feuding between the two families had lasted Joel 's entire lifetime . Joel had been taught to believe that Madeline was the culprit . In Don 's world , Sherry was undeniably the culprit , which is why he believed her to be the mastermind behind this play for power . Joel did n't know Sherry the way Don and his mother did . Her reign as Mrs. Dave Mitchell had led to the perpetual and merciless annihilation of his family . Rehashing the past with his father 's other son was a waste of time . Don walked away , praying every step of the way that he could control his burning distress . What was the point ? Joel was n't the source of his despair . Baby brother did n't have any more control over being the chosen child of Dave Mitchell than he had of ending up second best . Don had become the placeholder for whatever was left , but hating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come close to alleviating his rage . <p> Copyright 2009 by Patricia Haley <br> Continues ...
