Crpe de Chine Each night , after dinner , my father went downstairs to his workbench to build birdhouses , which he fashioned from scraps of wood left over from pine-paneling our basement . He was a connoisseur of birdhouses , my mother said . His favorite was a miniature replica of our ranch house , with a tiny Plexiglas picture window , a red Dutch door , and a shingled roof . It was a labor of love , he said the night he completed it . My brother , Davis , went to his room , where he listened to Radio Moscow on his shortwave . As for me : I cleared the table . " Sit with me , son , " my mother said . " Let 's pretend we 're sitting this dance out . " She told me I was her best friend . She said I had the heart to understand her . She was forty-six . I was nine . She sat at the table as if she were waiting to be photographed , holding her cigarette aloft . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked , lifting a Limoges pot from the table . She had been given the teapot by her mother , whom we called DearDear One , Dear Me , Dearest of Us All . Dear had just recently entered a sanatorium for depression , after having given away some of her most cherished possessions . When she died at home a few months latershe 'd returned to her deteriorated Brooklyn brownstone , where she slept on a roll-away bed in the basementmy mother found she 'd left an unwitnessed will written entirely in rhymed couplets : " I spent as I went / Seeking love and content , " it began . " No , " I told my mother as I examined the teapot 's gold-rimmed lid , " you have n't told me about it . " In fact , by then my mother had already told me about almost everything . But I wanted to heareverything again . What else in Carroll Knollsour sunstruck subdivision of identical brick housescould possibly have competed with the stories my mother would summon from her china or her incomplete sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept her dried corsages ? I wanted to live within the lull of her voice , soft and regretful , as she resuscitated the long-ago nights of her girlhood , those nights she waited for her parents to come home in taxicabs from parties , those nights they still lived in the largest house on Carroll Street , those nights before her parents ' divorce , before her father started his drinking . She whispered magic word : crpe de chine , Sherry Netherlands , Havilland , Stork Club , argent repouse . . . Night after night she told me her stories . Night after night I watched her smoke her endless Parliaments , stubbing out the lipstick-stained butts in a crystal ashtray . We sat at the half-cleared table like two deposed aristocrats for whom any word might serve as the switch of a minuterie that briefly lights a long corridor of memoryso long , in fact , the switch must be pressed repeatedly before they arrive at the door to their room . She said her mother had once danced with the Prince of Wales . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capone . She said she herself had once looked exactly like Merle Oberon . To prove it , she showed me photos of herself taken during her first marriage , when she was barely twenty . From every photo she 'd torn her ex-husband 's image , so that in most of them she was standing next to a jagged edge , and in some of them a part of her bodywhere he 'd had his hand on her arm , perhapswas torn away also . She said life was fifty-fifty with happiness and heartache . She said that when she was a girl she 'd kept a diary in which she 'd recorded the plots of her favorite movies . She said that if I was lucky I too would inherit the gift of gab . When I was little , she read me Goodnight , Moon . Goodnight , nobody . Goodnight , mush . And goodnight to the old lady whispering " hush . " But otherwise , she read me no bedtime books . She told me no fairy tales . Instead she came to my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Once upon a time , I had a gold brush and comb set . Once upon a time , my parents looked like F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald . Once upon a time , I rode a pony in Central Park . Once upon a time , I had a silver fox coat . Things she told me , sitting on the edge of my bed at night : " I was born with a caul . That means I have a sixth sense . " Or , touching her perfumed wrist to my cheek : " This is called Shalimar . ' " Or , faintly humming : " Do you know this tune ? Do you know When I Grow Too Old to Dream , I 'll Have You to Remember ' ? " Or sometimes when she coughedher " nervous cough , " her " smoker 's cough " she said , " One day , after I 'm gone , you 'll hear a woman cough like this , and you 'll think she is me.
