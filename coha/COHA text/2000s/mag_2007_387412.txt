. KILLER FOXES ! SOLDIERS WHO NEVER SLEEP ! THESE SCIENTISTS ARE DOING RESEARCH SO EXTRAORDINARY IT 'S SCARY ! . MAYBE WE SAW The Andromeda Strain a few too many times in our formative years , but we ca n't help shivering when we hear about microbiologists reanimating long-dormant lethal viruses . And those biologists working to make human limbs grow back : Have n't we seen that film ? Do n't the guys in lab coats all die in the first reel ? They may sound cinematic , but the incredible research projects on the following pages are not imaginary . They 're real , funded ventures by respected scientists . They have perfectly rational goals . They also happen to creep us out . REANIMATED INFECTION UP TO 50 MILLION people worldwide perished in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic . Within a year , the virus mutated , immunity spread , and the flu vanished . In October 2005 , a team led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pieced together the virus 's genome from lung tissue of a 1918 flu victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead . It 's out there , in a lab fridge , deadly as ever , right now . WHY , GOD ? WHY ? The scientists say that the virus can help reveal the mechanisms of a pandemic and that it offers timely insight into how the emerging H5N1 avian flu might have leapt from birds to humans . Reanimating the monster is a " practical curiosity , " says Erling Myhre , an infectious-disease physician at Lund University in Sweden and a former United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq . " It gives a better understanding of how genetic information in influenza can change over time . " The work goes on . Last October , members of the group debuted a vaccine to protect against the reanimated virus . FEAR FACTOR The project is what experts call " dual-use research " : It has beneficial uses but potentially nefarious ones too . Risk , researchers believe , is inherent to research on human threats . " The public has to understand that in order to be prepared for pandemics and bioterrorism , dangerous work has to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Federation of American Scientists . The work also freaks out scientists , however . " The 1918 flu reconstruction is a bad example to other countries , " argues Harvard University virologist Jens Kuhn , a member of the science working group for the nonprofit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation . With proper resources , " anyone can now also reproduce this virus from the published genome . " A team in Canada is already studying its own version . And escape from the kind of high-level containment labs that store the virus is n't unheard of  --  SARS samples inadvertently saw daylight several times during that epidemic several years ago . Although current antiviral drugs  --  and the new vaccine  --  thwart the reconstructed flu in mice , there 's no guarantee that they work as well on humans ( a problem because nobody born after 1930 is immune to the 1918 strain ) . " To proceed with the construction of this virus under those circumstances is irresponsible , " says Rutgers University microbiologist Richard Ebright , a prominent critic of the research . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it should have been done in a different way . " THE 22-HOUR WORKDAY ACCORDING to the National Sleep Foundation , 71 percent of Americans get eight hours of sleep or fewer on weeknights , and the percentage is rising . " We 're an increasingly sleep-deprived society , " says circadian-rhythm scientist Russell Foster of the University of Oxford . But a new crop of " wakefulness-promoting " drugs can improve alertness  --  with no real side effects . Last summer Darpa , the U.S. Department of Defense 's advanced-research arm , tested the drug CX717 by exposing subjects to battle conditions for four consecutive 20-hour days . Sleeping only four daylight hours , they remained amped and alert . Meanwhile , prescription modafinil can keep civilians fresh for 48 hours . Its successor , armodafinil , poised for FDA approval , lasts even longer . WHY , GOD ? WHY ? Pennsylvania-based drugmaker Cephalon developed modafinil and armodafinil to treat narcolepsy , sleep apnea and shift-work sleep disorder . But fighting drowsiness has world-changing potential . The electric lightbulb allowed workers to remain productive after dark . Drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next leap forward . FEAR FACTOR The pills make us more productive . But is that a good thing ? Will they cast us into true **28;5634;TOOLONG zombiehood ? " Modafinil is just the beginning , " says Pennsylvania State University sleep researcher David Dinges , who has tested it extensively . Foster agrees . " We may be the first species that will genuinely occupy the 24-hour day , " he says . " But we know very little about the consequences of subduing sleep . " ( Rats , it should be mentioned , die after 17 days without shut-eye . ) The drugs appear to act on one or two neurotransmitters . They 're not replicating real rest , though . It takes the combined efforts of four or five neurotransmitters to keep humans awake naturally . " The drugs can be effective for quite a while , " Dinges says , " but a chemical substitute for sleep they 're not . " PLANETARY SOLAR SHIELD THE LATEST plan for fighting global warming sounds more like intergalactic warfare : Launch clouds of miniature spacecraft that bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roger Angel of Steward Observatory Mirror Laboratory in Arizona has worked out the math . Now , with financial backing from the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts , he 's making a prototype of a light-diverting material . The gram-weight flyers he has in mind would be shot into L1 orbit , a sweet spot that follows the same yearly path as the Earth . From that vantage , the crafts ' collective shadow would help cool the entire planet . WHY , GOD ? WHY ? Increasing carbon dioxide levels mean that global temperatures could rise by 10F by century 's end . Deflecting some of the sun 's heat might mitigate doomsday effects like drought , flood , pestilence and extinction . FEAR FACTOR Is n't global warming about CO2 levels , not sunlight itself ? Do n't we need that light for something ... crucial ? " There would be some small effects on Earth , " Angel admits . Plants might grow a tad slower , and solar energy would n't be at top efficiency . " If you both turn up CO2 and block the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Pennsylvania , " you will not have exactly the same climate you had before . " More chilling to Alley is the idea that the spacecraft might suddenly fail . " Suppose we 've doubled , tripled , quadrupled CO2 , the temperature is up by 10F , and we 're holding it down , " he muses . " Then something breaks , and the spacecraft disappear . You want to see an abrupt climate change ? It would be a shock to the system . " Angel imagines that his method would be used in concert with other ways to turn down the heat . " This in no way removes the need to wean ourselves off carbon , " he says . " It 's a kind of insurance on the chance that our worst predictions actually play out . " GROW NEW APPENDAGES AMPHIBIANS can regenerate limbs . Mammals ca n't . " This is a significant problem , " says Tulane University cell biologist Ken Muneoka . Now two teams of bioscientists are out to correct our evolutionary shortcoming under a recent $7.6-million Darpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blastema  --  the cell bud that forms a new amphibian limb . In four years , Darpa wants a regrown mouse finger . Human research is the logical next step . WHY , GOD ? WHY ? The percentage of American combat amputees has doubled since the Korean War  --  a side effect of advancements in body armor and field medicine . Darpa funds will help scientists bolster preexisting research on the genetic and cellular processes of tissue regeneration . " Even if we fail , " says Muneoka , a team leader , " we 'll get better wound-healing . " FEAR FACTOR As unnatural as the project sounds ( " No , really , I have two left feet " ) , it does n't require genetic meddling , says the other team leader , Stephen Badylak of the University of Pittsburgh 's McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine . " The genes we need are there . " Mammals can already regrow limbs  --  to a point . Young children who lose fingertips can remake bone and tissue perfectly . The teams are following even more curious leads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab mouse , discovered by immunologist Ellen Heber-Katz of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia , fall between those of amphibians and normal mammals . Holes punched in ears , cut tail tips , even injured heart tissue  --  all grow back ( although when an MRL 's finger is cut lower than the tip , Heber-Katz says , " it 's able to form a structure but not the full digit " ) . The research could be life-changing for amputees . The scientists believe that a mixture of cellular and extracellular components  --  maybe hormones , vitamin A , fibroblasts  --  could be applied to fresh amputations to steer them toward regeneration . " We grow a whole human in nine months , " Badylak says . " A limb should be nothing ! " Laura Allen 's last feature , " Science Confirms the Obvious ! , " appeared in the May 2007 issue . IN THE WILDS OF SIBERIA . THEY 'RE BREEDING THE ULTIMATE VICIOUS CARNIVORE SCIENTISTS AT THE INSTITUTE of Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk , Russia , have been selectively breeding silver foxes for hostility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap , and lunge when humans approach their cages . WHY , GOD ? WHY ? The late geneticist Dmitry Belyaev began the experiment with a more benign goal : ultimate tameness . Beginning in 1959 , Belyaev bred successive generations of friendly foxes , essentially replicating the 12,000-year-old process of domestication in a fraction of the time . The project continues to reveal how wolves may have evolved into docile dogs at the hands of humans . But in 1970 , to explore the spectrum of behavior , the program began to breed vicious specimens . " It was a crackpot scheme , " says Caroline Blanchard , a University of Hawaii aggression researcher who visited the farm . But it made waves . A 1999 American Scientist article by Belyaev 's successor , Lyudmila Trut , " had a huge impact , " says Sergio Pellis of Canada 's University of Lethbridge , who studies aggressive play . " Having animals at extremes , you can identify processes for each trait . " FEAR FACTORThe foxes are n't going anywhere . They live in metal cages outside one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to escape somehow , they would n't survive for long . " The term " aggressive " is misapplied . These animals are hyper-defensive , " Pellis says . The risk-averse foxes would n't attack  --  they 'd probably hide until they starved . YOU CA N'T REASON WITH THEM . YOU CA N'T KILL THEM . THEY 'RE ... MERCILESS ROBOT SOLDIERS THE SOUTH KOREAN government and Samsung Techwin recently debuted SGR-A1 , a weaponized robot that autonomously tracks intruders up to about two and a half miles away with high-resolution and infrared cameras . Anyone who does n't give the robot 's voice-recognition system the correct secret code is identified as an enemy to a remote human operator , who directs the " droid to unleash a warning , rubber bullets , tear gas or live rounds . WHY , GOD ? WHY ? South Korea has one of the world 's lowest birth rates and shares a border with one of the most feared military dictatorships . The government is pouring millions of dollars into the development of guard robots to ease manpower shortages along borders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter service after 2008 FEAR FACTORFoster-Miller , the company that created the first weaponized robots  --  the Iraq-bound Swords  --  has heard all the safety concerns . " The U.S. was adamant that we absolutely prove beyond any doubt that Swords can not fire on its own , " says vice president Robert Quinn . Samsung insists that it 's taken equal precautions : A person must engage a key before hitting SGR-A1 's " fire " button , and the operator can designate no-fire zones . ( " The exact nature of the safety system is classified , " says collaborator Hanseok Ko of Korea University , " but its goal is to prevent accidents . " ) Still , soldiers making life-or-death judgments through a robotic proxy is undeniably disturbing . Reference See also additional image in Table of Contents of same issue .
