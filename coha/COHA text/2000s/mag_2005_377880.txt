In the 1990s , when Jackie Chan and Jet Li were the hot international news out of Hong Kong , another actor was the colony 's No. 1 box-office draw . Stephen Chow 's raucous comedies tickled the locals no end , but since his humor was largely verbal ( a nonsense patter known as " mo-lei-tau " ) , few were betting that he could become a star in the West . Chow took the bet and made two action comedies  --  Shaolin Soccer ( 2001 ) and Kung Fu Hustle ( 2004 )  --  that were huge pan-Asian hits and proved him an expert director as well as an engaging joker . With Hustle 's release on 2,000 U.S. screens this week , Americans get to see what 's so funny about Chow . The laugh 's on them for not noticing him before . <P> In the 1940s of Chow 's teeming fantasy , Shanghai is terrorized by the Axe Gang , a thug team as dapper as they are vicious : they don black suits and top hats , and rumba to a rumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily immune to their predations  --  in part because the neighborhood is so poor , in part because all the residents , from the baker and the tailor to the kids and seniors , are skilled in martial arts . The Landlady ( Yuen Qiu ) , spuming belligerence , can suck a cigarette to cinders in one deep breath , and has a lion 's roar scream that rattles windows a continent away . Into the alley wanders Sing ( Chow ) , a loser punk who is desperate to be an Axe man . But destiny has another , redemptive scenario in store . This accident-prone scoundrel has the makings of a natural-born kung fu genius  --  just the fellow to do battle against that legendary killer the Beast ( Leung Siu-lung ) . <P> Chow , 42 , seems to have been preparing for Kung Fu Hustle all his life . As a boy mesmerized by Bruce Lee films , he studied kung fu techniques . In his first TV job , as host of the daytime show Space Shuttle 430 , he learned how to amuse kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He became a film star as the little guy with false bravado who lucks into hero status . That 's the formula here , but this time Chow does n't take center stage until the last half an hour . Instead he uses his old comic style  --  mixing deadpan delivery with wild visual gags  --  to create an elegant directorial approach . <P> How so ? The comedy is Buster Keaton  --  ish in its precision timing . Chow 's swooping camera is as nimble , and as respectful of Hong Kong film tradition , as the veteran actors he has assembled . The film merrily flouts the laws of time and physics . Teeth fly upward in slo-mo ; then a Road Runner  --  style chase zips by in superspeedy-mo . The Pig Sty denizens have the resilience of Warner Bros. cartoon characters : lips , throats , bosoms expand to gargantuan size , then snap back . Punctuating the mayhem are sound effects ( mooing , clucking , cat mewls , toad croaks ) worthy of a Spike Jones symphony . <P> If you 're just looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hustle has that too , courtesy of stunt director Yuen Wo-ping ( The Matrix , Kill Bill ) , and a subplot that reunites Sing with the love of his youth . And watch for the sly homages to Western action films . Moviemaking does n't get much smarter , funnier , handsomer , better than this .  --  By Richard Corliss
