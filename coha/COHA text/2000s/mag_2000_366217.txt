Personally , I think the Pope is capable of admitting courageously , ' I can no longer carry out my task in an adequate way . ' I believe the Pope would be capable of that if he had the impression that he was no longer able to lead the Church with authority . " After Bishop Karl Lehmann of Mainz offered that opinion on German radio , a small earthquake of headlines went through Rome . GERMAN BISHOPS : THE POPE IS SICK , HE SHOULD RESIGN , declared one paper . WOJTILA STEP ASIDE , A STRONG POPE IS NEEDED , said another , using John Paul II 's family name . <P> A papal abdication ? The commotion overshadowed the announcement that the Pope would travel to the Middle East in March as part of the Jubilee Year , a period for which he has been strenuously preparing . There has been some concern over the image of the Pontiff broadcast over the millennial weekend : one of a visibly weakened man . The vigorous 58-year-old elected in 1978 to challenge communism suffers from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty negotiating steps . His left arm shakes , at times uncontrollably . His face is rigid , and his speech is slurred . At the end of 1999 , his aides moved him around St. Peter 's Basilica with a pushcart . <P> But there has been no voluntary papal abdication since Celestine V in 1294 . And while Celestine was later canonized , Dante placed him in the Inferno for il gran rifiuto ( the great refusal ) , albeit only in the first circle of Hell : Limbo . Other pontiffs have been removed by murder , martyrdom , military intervention or rare coups by the College of Cardinals during pagan rule , the confusion of the Dark Ages , Byzantine meddling , populist revolutions or chronic political impotence . But what would happen if one of the most significant successors of St. Peter in the past 100 years were to give up his throne ? <P> " If he resigns , he has to pack up and go , " says the Jesuit scholar Thomas Reese . If he retires after 80 ( an age he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend the conclave that will gather to elect his successor . But John Paul II in living retirement would also be an influence too powerful to ignore , even if he is not anywhere near the voting cardinals . He is probably aware that every new Pope in the past 300 years has been dramatically different from his predecessor . John Paul II may have forestalled that by naming some 90% of the cardinals now in the college . If he retired , he would be even more certain that the church stays his course . Could a new Pope change policies if the former Pope , with all his prestige , were still alive , looking over his shoulder ? Japanese Emperors and Shoguns used to " retire " to achieve just that kind of uncrossable seniority . <P> But last week 's kerfuffle may have more personal roots . There is no love lost between John Paul and Bishop Lehmann , who heads the German Catholic Bishops Conference . The German church runs 250 abortion-counseling centers , and after five years of wrangling , its bishops bowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuing certificates that permit women to terminate a pregnancy within the first 12 weeks . ( Without the certificate , abortion is illegal . ) Says historian and novelist Father Andrew Greeley : " Lehmann wo n't be made a cardinal as long as John Paul is Pope . "
