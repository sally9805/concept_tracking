War designed to fit a theory , as the Bush administration learned last week , can falter when key assumptions do n't pan out . After months of selling its case , the Administration gave the impression it had devised a Teflon war : quick , easy , relatively bloodless . War boosters predicted that Iraq 's leadership would snap , Iraqi forces would surrender , Iraqi citizens would welcome American soldiers with open arms . Now that the first week 's fighting has sometimes failed to match those expectations , some experts are asserting that the U.S. was not prepared for some of the possible difficulties . <P> THERE WOULD BE LITTLE RESISTANCE <P> " The enemy we 're fighting , " said Army Lieut . General William Wallace last week , " is different from the one we 'd war-gamed against . " At least the commander of V Corps and the highest-ranking officer at the front was honest in assessing one of the most unsettling battlefield surprises : Iraqis are resisting vigorously . And they 're doing so in ways that seem to have caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces behind the front lines to engage in guerrilla tactics that ca n't win the war but can dangerously drag it out . If the Pentagon 's plan was to fight from the " inside out "  --  a lightning drive on Baghdad to decapitate the regime and then liberate the rest of the country  --  Saddam has counterattacked from the outside in . He let allied forces plunge deep inside Iraq , leaving their rear and flanks ill protected so that his forces could harass and ambush them . His aim was shrewd and twofold : to pester and wear down allied forces and lure the U.S. into inflicting politically costly civilian casualties . <P> That 's not how the theologians predicted the campaign would unfold . The theory was that the initial display of military might by U.S. warplanes and ground troops would " shock and awe " the Iraqi military and high-ranking officials into the conviction that resistance was futile . The despot 's regime , Administration officials insisted , was too " brittle " to survive such an onslaught . Iraqi troops would defect en masse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turncoats among the military 's highest echelons . Just two days before the opening salvo , Richard Perle , a leading war booster on the Pentagon 's Defense Policy Board , predicted , " Even those closest around the Iraqi President will understand they have no chance in the face of what 's coming after them . " <P> But " shock and awe " has failed to deliver a knockout blow thus far . Punishing strikes damaged trappings of Saddam 's power but failed to crack the regime . The thunderous barrage did n't break ordinary Iraqis either . Saddam 's ghostly appearances on national television convinced his citizens  --  if not Washington  --  that he remained in control . Iraqis have endured bombing intermittently for more than 12 years and have learned resilience.
