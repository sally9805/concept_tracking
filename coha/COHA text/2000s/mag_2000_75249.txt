Judging a book by the author 's acknowledgments is a little like judging a fight by a boxer 's postmatch interview . What should count in the ring are the punches thrown and taken ; in a book it 's the research and writing . Still , read the acknowledgments at the end of Tosches 's new biography of the troubled and troubling man who held the heavyweight championship from 1962 to ' 64 : " This is a dark tale . It could not be otherwise , as I knew when I took its first breath into me .... In my work on this book , I encountered those who cleared the shadows with light , and those who overcast light with shadow . Enlightenment , enshadowment . Which leads to which ? And , in the end , are they one and the same ? " // Huh ? Perhaps the referee should have stepped in on this one . Tosches , a contributing editor for Vanity Fair and the author of well-received biographies of Dean Martin , Mafia financier Michele Sindona and rocker Jerry Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  digging through police files , court documents and congressional testimony and interviewing more than two dozen people who knew Liston and dozens of others familiar with boxing and/or organized crime  --  but he has also laden his subject with so much sociological and existential baggage that Liston staggers under the weight . // " My boyhood fascination with Sonny Liston , " Tosches writes early in the book , " had to do with his being as feared and hated by blacks as by whites . He was the ultimate outlaw .... I knew that there was no other fighter like Sonny Liston . There never had been and there never would be . " He proceeds to promise that " the secret history of Sonny Liston ... would reveal a soul that , even amid the darkness in which it dwelt , eluded all concepts of good and evil , of right and wrong , of light and dark themselves . " That 's a lot to ask of a pug , even one of the most fearsome heavyweight champs of all time . // Using an occasionally pretentious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liston , who famously trained to the driving beat of Night Train ) , Tosches paints a compelling picture of the fighter 's early days of poverty in Arkansas , thuggery in St. Louis and eventual confinement in the Missouri state penitentiary . Tosches also provides a gritty portrait of an era in which the mob , led by Frankie Carbo and Blinky Palermo , controlled boxing and , according to the author , Liston 's career . When it comes to ring history , however , Tosches tends to swing from the heels  --  blithely stating , for instance , that Archie Moore took a dive in his 1955 heavyweight title bout against Rocky Marciano . ( Never mind that Marciano was the favorite and that Moore decked Marciano and then took a fierce beating before succumbing only in the ninth round of a classic bout . ) Tosches also asserts that both of Liston 's losses to Muhammad Ali , whom Tosches grumpily dismisses as " tiresome , " " trying " and " drably colorful , " were fixes . Liston 's criminal ties are undeniable , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a punch it was a sham . // In the end Tosches fails to settle the very mystery he sets out to solve : whether Liston , who was found dead of a drug overdose in his house in Las Vegas on Jan. 5 , 1971 , was murdered . " The only real mystery is one without an answer , " Tosches concludes . " There is only one real cause of death , and that is death . " Gosh . // Tosches clearly is a writer with some punch . Too bad he wasted it here on several rounds of enshadowment boxing .
