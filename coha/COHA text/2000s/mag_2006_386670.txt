. Q WHO WAS BOND 'S SKI STUNT DOUBLE AND HOW DID HE GET THE JOB ? The Doctor has to admit that he belongs to the generation for whom , if there was ever any question that skiing was cool , James Bond removed all doubt . And though several skiers have stood in for 007 , the man most identified with the job is Canadian John Eaves . A six-time world freestyle champion , Eaves got the gig from his longtime sponsor , Willy Bogner , who , in addition to sewing a fabulous one-piece , was the Warren Miller of Europe and a chum of Bond producer Cubby Broccoli . Eaves 's first assignment was the most famous of Bond 's many pre-coital ski adventures : the bobsleigh-run chase scene in Roger Moore 's 1981 For Your Eyes Only , which took six weeks to shoot and left Eaves both shaken and stirred . In later film exploits , Eaves played a romantic lead opposite Suzy Chaffee in Bogner 's ski film classic Fire and Ice , and also taught Jackie Chan how to snowboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing custom adventure films for a wealthy European clientele . A HOW DO CREVASSES FORM ? AND WHY DO SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM " CREVICES " ? Hey , that 's a prime example of the great U.S. tradition of stealing words from the French while showing their pronunciation no respect . ( Dr. Flake personally bitch slaps those who call couloirs " coolers . " ) Here , though , you have a choice . Both " crevasse " and " crevice " come from the French word crevace , meaning " crack . " Nineteenth-century alpinists adopted the term , with a slightly different spelling , to refer to the rips in glaciers . However , most mountaineers now use " crevice " to describe a rock fisure , while " crev-asse " refers only to that icy crack of doom into which you must never , ever ski . How they form is simple . Ice may seem as brittle as glass , and at the surface it is . But with greater depth comes greater pressure , and therefore increased plasticity . So , the ice down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brittle ice at the surface can deform only so much before cracks appear . WHO SELLS THE WORLD 'S MOST EXPENSIVE LIFT TICKETS ? The priciest is Vail , and they 're proud of it . At $81 last season , it was three dollars more than both Aspen and Deer Valley . That said , it 's still America : Anyone who ca n't find a discount program does n't deserve one . Meanwhile , Zermatt/Cervinia is Europe 's most expensive at $61 . At the other end of the scale is Wolf Mountain , Utah , where an adult weekday ticket costs a mere $22 . Internationally , though , nothing tops our friendly allies in Iran for skiing cheap . At Dizin , just north of Tehran , you can lap up their 2,800 feet of vert on a full-day lift pass ... at a laughable $6 . And though men and women have separate lift lines , at least the slopes are n't segregated anymore . What 's Farsi for " booty call ? " WHY DO SOME MOUNTAINS HAVE TIGHTER TREES THAN OTHERS ? Trees can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist arboreal species . Fire , disease , blowdown , insects , and summer mudslides do their share , as does the grazing of various ungulates ( i.e. elk and deer , but not yetis ) . And a slope need n't be on a bona fide slide path in order to suffer the occasional spruce-snapping avalanche . But according to Allan Drury , the inventor of cat-skiing and the proprietor of BC 's Selkirk Wilderness Skiing , natural glades in his neck of the woods become common " at the magical elevation of 6,500 feet . There , the growing season is only three months and there 's fierce competition for what soil and moisture there is . Where drainages tend to dry out , like on south-facing slopes , only so many trees can make it . " Nevertheless , like many resort operators , Drury employs a thinning crew every summer for stashes below 6,500 feet . Four or five dudes with chainsaws sure can make some nice nature .
