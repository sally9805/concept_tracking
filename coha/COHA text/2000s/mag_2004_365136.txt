This summer a crop of new hybrid fruits is turning up at the grocery store . Mango-nectarines , above , combine the taste of a mango with the texture of a nectarine . Also new is the Nectacotum Pluot , a combo of nectarine and pluot , which is itself a cross between plums and apricots . And this is the first season that mini-watermelons are available . They can be 25% as large as the standard variety and up to 50% sweeter .  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
