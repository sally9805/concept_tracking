The Strip Is Back ! <P> The sin and foolishness that pass for fun in Las Vegas should make us stop and wonder where we are going as a nation . PATRICIA DEE Glennie , Mich . <P> I was very disappointed that " The Strip is Back ! " depicted Las Vegas as a sexy , sinful playground for adults July 26 . I have been to the city on many occasions with my husband and young children . Las Vegas is an elegant and entertaining city of great hotels and restaurants , wonderful shows and child-friendly arcades . But the pictures of strip clubs in your story were off-putting . You even made the Mandalay Bay 's casino look seedy and cheap . What did you intend to do , keep middle-class people from visiting ? MONICA STEVENS Farmington , Mich . <P> TIME captured one side of life in Las Vegas in vivid detail : lots of money , alcohol and sex . How about a follow-up on the other side ? Alcoholism , venereal disease , unwanted pregnancies , loneliness and heartbreak  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa . <P> Vegas is great for kids . I spent a week there in February with my husband and young grandchildren . We stayed four nights each at the Monte Carlo and Circus Circus , including a quick overnight drive to see the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam . Las Vegas has the best public bus transportation I 've ever used . And I was impressed that the hotel employees stepped right in if I inadvertently took the children to an adult-oriented area . There are museums , amusement rides , water parks and great little shops that cater to youthful tastes . PHYLLIS H.

BRAD MILLER Encinitas , Calif . <P> Know Thine Enemy <P> " The Iran Connection " reported on the evidence uncovered by the 9/11 commission that there were contacts between al-Qaeda and Iran between October 2000 and February 2001 July 26 . That is further confirmation that the U.S. attacked the wrong country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story noted that Osama bin Laden declined an offer of collaboration with Iran to avoid alienating his supporters in Saudi Arabia . So , what better country to attack than Saudi Arabia ? The warfare should have been not military but economic , in the form of subsidizing a Manhattan Project to end our dependence on oil . We can start now and lead the world , or wait for the oil to run out and watch other countries take advantage . BILL ZAWACKI Beaverton , Ore . <P> Dishonorable Men <P> " Marked Women " JULY 26 , on the rash of honor killings committed by Iraqi men against female family members suspected of straying from traditional rules of chastity , left me overcome with feelings of outrage , disgust and sadness . My beautiful 16-year-old daughter died in a car accident several years ago , and her loss continues to bring our family indescribable pain . I know that her father and brother would give their lives in a heartbeat if doing so would bring her back . That fathers and brothers would take the lives of daughters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOUISE MCLEOD Duncan , B.C.
