" Goodness , what beautiful diamonds ! " a hatcheck girl says to Mae West , who purrs , " Goodness had nothin ' to do with it , dearie . " That line , from West 's 1932 Night After Night , embodied the saucy spirit of early talkies . Now that Hollywood could speak , it did so in the tart cadences of fast-talking men and faster women . This freedom created fresh stars ( James Cagney , Barbara Stanwyck , Jean Harlow ) and a sexual impudence that riled the burghers of propriety . <P> In 1934 the potent Roman Catholic lobby formed the Legion of Decency to rate films . Soon after , Will Hays , the industry 's political and moral arbiter , called on Joseph Breen , a prominent Catholic , to enforce a rigorous production code . Studios rushed to sanitize some projects ( West got married at the end of Belle of the Nineties ) and dump others ( MGM had to wait 12 years to film The Postman Always Rings Twice ) . Moviegoers that summer Sunday may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations . But filmmakers evolved a new " code , " one that traded starkness for subtlety . Audiences quickly learned this covert language in which a woman 's knowing smile was its own double entendre , and a kiss was never just a kiss .  --  By Richard Corliss
