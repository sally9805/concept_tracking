Section : Nation &; World Portrait : Frances Fragos Townsend <p> It sure felt like a heart-stopping moment . On August 1 , Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge raised the color-coded threat alert level because of new intelligence pointing toward an al Qaeda plot to attack major financial institutions . But when word leaked out that the intelligence was old , raising skepticism about the supposed threat , the White House benched Ridge and dispatched a very different kind of messenger to try to shore up the administration 's shaken credibility . Petite , blond , expensively dressed , and telegenic to boot , Frances Fragos Townsend is a far cry from the rumpled suits and ramrod-straight law enforcement types who typically work the Washington terrorism beat . <p> For a few days back then , Townsend was everywhere . She has largely shunned the media spotlight since , but inside the administration , her role has grown . It is Townsend who has led the government 's response over the past year to numerous terrorism-related threats and crises , first as deputy national security adviser for counterterrorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security . Now , as George W. Bush prepares to resume his second-term cabinet shuffle , Townsend may be headed for a bigger job , perhaps even homeland security secretary if Ridge opts to step down . <p> Survivor . To many old Washington hands , the casting is stunning . A registered Republican , Townsend , 42 , is a holdover from the Clinton administration , where she served as Attorney General Janet Reno 's trusted but controversial intelligence adviser . She was so controversial that Reno 's replacement , John Ashcroft , dropped Townsend from the top intelligence job , but now she 's back in power  --  big time . " There 's this huge head scratch to the whole thing , " says a former Justice Department official in the Clinton administration . " How can this crowd of people who are all about , ' Oh , you 've got to be a true believer , ' let her into the fold and allow her to reach this incredible height ? " <p> The answer depends on who 's supplying it . Townsend has an abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate wheat from chaff , " says Deputy Attorney General James Comey , an unabashed admirer . " There 's a tendency in the counterterrorism arena , because of the stakes and because of people 's worries about making mistakes , not to prioritize among pieces of information . Fran Townsend has the ability and the courage to say : ' This is important ; this is not important . Focus on the important thing . ' " <p> Townsend 's critics , unsurprisingly , do n't see it quite that way . " She 's a trip ; she 's one of the most ambitious people I 've met , " says a former Bush administration official . " She 's always sucking up . " <p> Townsend credits her success to tenacity . " Nobody could be more surprised than I , " she said in an interview , " that I wound up here . " Townsend is the only child of Irish-Catholic parents from Long Island . Neither parent finished high school , and they separated when she was a teenager . Townsend 's mother , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . But Townsend was also close to her father , a roofer and World War II veteran . <p> Townsend 's career began as a prosecutor in the Brooklyn district attorney 's office , but it took off when she moved to the U.S. attorney 's office in Manhattan , where she began prosecuting corporate and mob cases for Rudolph Giuliani . Comey , a young prosecutor there , remembers the disappointment of some of Townsend 's witnesses when he was asked to take over one of her Mafia cases . " You know , " he says , laughing , " they were all depressed when I became their handler , and I do n't think it 's because I 'm any less attractive . It 's just that she had a great rapport with people  --  great people skills . " <p> It was n't long before Townsend wound up at the Justice Department in Washington . There she spent the next 13 years in a series of high-profile jobs and became Reno 's close personal friend and most trusted adviser . " She had an ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in an interview . Although she worked at " Main Justice , " as department headquarters is known , Townsend 's soul was really attuned to the agency just across the street , the FBI . " She was a wannabe FBI agent ; she loved the FBI . She reveled in that , " says a knowledgeable source . Townsend developed a unique perspective on al Qaeda because of her close personal friendship with a legendary FBI agent and al Qaeda expert named John O'Neill , who retired from the bureau but lost his life on Sept. 11 , 2001 , just days after starting his job as security chief at the World Trade Center . Today , Townsend has lots of admirers at the bureau . " I ca n't think of any door I would n't go through with Fran Townsend by my side , " says Pasquale D'Amuro , who runs the FBI 's New York field office . <p> Another of Townsend 's mentors is former FBI Director Louis Freeh , who encouraged her to accept a sensitive Justice job that turned into a hornet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Townsend became the head of the powerful Office of Intelligence Policy and Review . The OIPR enforces a controversial statute known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , under which the FBI or other agencies can obtain special wiretaps and other search and surveillance warrants to track spies and terrorists . A FISA court meets in secret to approve requests for the wiretaps and warrants . Since FISA warrants are intended primarily to gather intelligence , not prosecute criminals , there was tension and confusion at the time over whether the information they produced could be shared with agents or prosecutors working on criminal cases . Townsend found herself in the middle of that debate over how much of a " wall " should exist between intelligence-gatherers and prosecutors , and her tenure at OIPR remains controversial today . Many FBI agents say Townsend was crucial in obtaining FISA wiretaps , especially during the period of heightened terrorism concerns around the new millennium . But many prosecutors felt that Townsend was less than helpful in making sure the FBI shared wiretap data with lawyers at Main Justice when there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court and its chief judge at the time , Royce Lamberth , would refuse to approve search warrants and wiretaps if they believed too much information sharing was going on and if prosecutors were controlling or directing the intelligence-gathering efforts . One knowledgeable source backs her up and says Townsend " cared very much about following procedures . " But others suspect an ulterior motive . Some Justice Department prosecutors felt Townsend wanted to keep the wall up because it kept prosecutors out of national security investigations , leaving more authority in the hands of Townsend and friendly bureau agents . <p> Whatever the case , there were serious consequences . Both the Government Accountability Office and the 9/11 commission have blamed OIPR in part for the government 's intelligence failures before the terrorist attacks . Sources say that OIPR 's narrow interpretation of FISA led to misunderstandings and overly cautious behavior by the FBI . As a result , in July and August of 2001 , FBI intelligence analysts prohibited their own criminal-case agents from searching for two men on the government 's terrorist watch list who they knew had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be two of the 19 hijackers . The 9/11 commission said OIPR had become the " sole gatekeeper " of FISA intelligence by arguing that " its position reflected the concerns " of Judge Lamberth . " The office threatened that if it could not regulate the flow of information to criminal prosecutors , it would no longer present the FBI 's warrant requests to the FISA court , " the report said . " The information flow withered . " <p> Friction . Several Reno aides say the attorney general relied too heavily on Townsend . " There 's no single person that Janet Reno had a bigger blind spot for than her , " says a Justice official . In fact , some of Reno 's senior aides distrusted Townsend so much , sources say , that one asked that Reno 's confidential assistant inform him if Town-send violated protocol and approached Reno directly . <p> Some senior FBI officials blame Lamberth , not Townsend , for the FISA problems . Townsend says she repeatedly tried to persuade the judge to lower the " wall " but knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FISA court held a rare meeting of the full court to discuss " wall " - related issues . " The chief judge was so annoyed with me , " says Townsend , " that he would n't permit me personally to attend , because I had pushed so hard against the restrictions they had imposed . " Others say the real root of Lamberth 's anger at Townsend was the false information given by the FBI in dozens of wiretap applications to the FISA court . Lamberth declined to comment . But he told Reno 's successor , Ashcroft , that he had lost faith in Townsend . Knowing she was in an untenable situation , Townsend says , she told Ashcroft 's then acting deputy , Robert Mueller , that she was willing to step aside . Townsend says Mueller consulted with Ashcroft and told her that she was out . Mueller , who is now the FBI director , declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that Townsend had " voluntarily moved " during the Bush transition . " Fran is a true professional , " Mueller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As such , she brings experienced leadership to the war on terror . " <p> Townsend , described as " furious " by a former Bush administration official , was out of a job  --  but not for long . In August 2001 , she became assistant commandant of intelligence at the U.S. Coast Guard , back then an orphan agency that was viewed as a law enforcement Siberia . After the September 11 attacks , however , the Coast Guard became a key player in the war on terrorism  --  and so did Townsend . " We thought it was a great catch , " Coast Guard Commandant Adm . Thomas Collins told U.S. News in an interview , saying Townsend helped " break dishes " to merge the agency 's intelligence and criminal operations . " She had an incredible value for us , " Collins added . <p> Others in the counterterrorism community took notice . Barely two years later , Townsend was on her way back to the top . As National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice 's counterterrorism deputy , Townsend beefed up White House involvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several trips to Saudi Arabia . " She 's been very important on issues of terrorist financing , " Rice told U.S. News . Rice said Townsend also played a key " debottlenecking " role in Iraq , to " make sure people were getting the kind of merged intelligence that was needed . " <p> When Rice 's counterpart at the homeland security council , Gen. John Gordon  --  another Townsend mentor  --  retired , he pushed her as his replacement . Today , Townsend 's biggest challenge will be to ensure that the administration 's color-coded threat system is not viewed as political scaremongering , as it was back in August . Townsend has " precious little interaction , if any , " she says , with the White House political operation . " Terrorism ought not to be about politics , " Townsend says , " and I do n't think it is in this administration . " <p> Last March , however , Townsend made a $2,000 contribution to the Bush-Cheney re-election campaign , just two days after Rice 's former counterterrorism coordinator Richard Clarke  --  another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9/11 commission hearings . Townsend 's contribution was widely viewed as a pledge of loyalty to Bush . Whether it was or not , Townsend , once again , is in line for another move up .
