<p> Prime Minister Ehud Barak told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that Israel 's proposal to hand over two-thirds of the West Bank in a peace deal is not necessarily its final offer , Barak 's top policy adviser said Thursday . <p> Israel presented a final status map to the Palestinians in negotiations last week . Under the Israeli plan , the West Bank would be cut up into blocs , and Israel would annex chunks of land to bring most Jewish settlers under Israeli sovereignty . <p> The Palestinians have refused to discuss the map , saying it was unacceptable . <p> The Israeli daily Maariv wrote Thursday that Israel proposed to transfer land in two stages . In the first stage , with the signing of the peace treaty due this year , the Palestinians would receive 66 percent of the West Bank . An additional 14 percent , much of it in the Jordan Valley , would remain under Israeli sovereignty , but could come under Palestinian rule after a test period of several years . <p> Israel would annex 20 percent of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in Palestinian territory , Maariv said . It was not clear whether Israel proposed to dismantle them or ask settlers to live under Palestinian sovereignty . <p> Two west-east strips of Israeli-controlled land would connect Israel to a narrow path of annexed land in the Jordan Valley , which is to serve as a buffer between Jordan and the Palestinian entity , Maariv said . Roads , bridges and tunnels would connect the areas under Palestinian control . <p> The Palestinians have reacted angrily to the Israeli proposal . In a final peace treaty , they want control over all of the West Bank , Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem , areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war . <p> Arafat told Barak in their Sunday meeting that the map was unacceptable , said three senior Palestinian officials who spoke separately , all on condition of anonymity . Barak assured the Palestinian leader that this was not Israel 's final offer , the officials said . <p> Danny Yatom , Barak 's chief policy adviser , confirmed the account . <p> " We told them that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been completed , " Yatom told The Associated Press . " If the Palestinians have comments on the map , we will see what we can do . It does n't have to be the final map . This is the dynamic . This is part of the character of the negotiations . " <p> A peace treaty is due Sept. 13 . However , negotiators are far behind schedule , and are not expected to reach agreement on the outline of an accord by Saturday 's target date . Last week 's round of negotiations yielded no results . <p> An Arafat adviser , Nabil Abourdeneh , said Israel 's final status map was not very different from one proposed by Israel 's opposition leader , Ariel Sharon , when he served as foreign minister in the previous hardline government . " We can call it the Sharon-plus map , " Abourdeneh said . " We totally reject it . " <p> The Palestinians are waiting for U.S. mediator Dennis Ross to return to the region with new proposals , Abourdeneh said . Ross left for Washington last week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Middle East early next week . <p> " There is a need for the Americans to make a move and there is a need for ideas to be proposed in order to get the negotiations out of the deadlock , " Abourdeneh said .
