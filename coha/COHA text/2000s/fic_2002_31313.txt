" Have you seen it ? " asked Samantha . I leaned close to my computer so my editor would n't hear me on a personal call . " Seen what ? " " Oh , nothing . Never mind . We 'll talk when you get home . " " Seen what ? " I asked again . " Nothing , " Samantha repeated . " Samantha , you have never once called me in the middle of the day about nothing . Now come on . Spill . " Samantha sighed . " Okay , but remember : Do n't shoot the messenger . " Now I was getting worried . " Moxie . The new issue . Cannie , you have to go get one right now . " " Why ? What 's up ? Am I one of the Fashion Faux Pas ? " " Just go to the lobby and get it . I 'll hold . " This was important . Samantha was , in addition to being my best friend , also an associate at Lewis , Dommel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her assistant tell them she was in a meeting . Samantha herself did not hold . " It 's a sign of weakness , " she 'd told me . I felt a small twinge of anxiety work its way down my spine . I took the elevator to the lobby of the Philadelphia Examiner , waved at the security guard , and walked to the small newsstand , where I found Moxie on the rack next to its sister publications , Cosmo and Glamour and Mademoiselle . It was hard to miss , what with the supermodel in sequins beneath headlines blaring " Come Again : Multiple Orgasm Made Easy ! " and " Ass-Tastic ! Four Butt Blasters to Get your Rear in Gear ! " After a quick minute of deliberation , I grabbed a small bag of chocolate M &M's,; paid the gum-chomping cashier , and went back upstairs . Samantha was still holding . " Page 132 , " she said . I sat , eased a few M &M's; into my mouth , and flipped to page 132 , which turned out to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to help the average reader understand what her boyfriend was up to ... or was n't up to , as the case might be .

" Bruce Guberman had been my boyfriend for just over three years , until we 'd decided to take a break three months ago . And the Larger Woman , I could only assume , was me . You know how in scary books a character will say , " I felt my heart stop ? " Well , I did . Really . Then I felt it start to pound again , in my wrists , my throat , my fingertips . The hair at the back of my neck stood up . My hands felt icy . I could hear the blood roaring in my ears , as I read the first line of the article : " I 'll never forget the day I found out my girlfriend weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it was coming from far , far away . " Cannie ? Cannie , are you there ? " " I 'll kill him ! " I choked . " Take deep breaths , " Samantha counseled . " In through the nose , out through the mouth . " Betsy , my editor , cast a puzzled look across the partition that separated our desks . " Are you all right ? " she mouthed . I squeezed my eyes shut . My headset had somehow landed on the carpet . " Breathe ! " I could hear Samantha say , her voice a tinny echo from the floor . I was wheezing , gasping . I could feel chocolate and bits of candy shell on my teeth . I could see the quote they 'd lifted , in bold-faced pink letters that screamed out from the center of the page . " Loving a larger woman , " Bruce had written , " is an act of courage in our world . " " I ca n't believe this ! I ca n't believe he did this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled around to my desk and was trying to peer over my shoulder at the magazine in my lap , and Gabby , my evil coworker , was looking our way , her beady brown eyes squinting for signs of trouble , thick fingers poised over her keyboard so that she could instantly e-mail the bad news to her pals . I slammed the magazine closed . I took a successful deep breath , and waved Betsy back to her seat . Samantha was waiting . " You did n't know ? " " Did n't know what ? That he thought dating me was an act of courage ? " I attempted a sardonic snort . " He should try being me . " " So you did n't know he got a job at Moxie . " I flipped to the front , where Contributors were listed in thumbnail profiles beneath arty black-and-white head shots . And there was Bruce , with his shoulder-length hair blowing in what was assuredly artificial wind . He looked , I thought uncharitably , like Yanni . " ' Good in Bed ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A freelance writer from New Jersey , Guberman is currently at work on his first novel . " " His first novel ? " I said . Well , shrieked , maybe . Heads turned . Over the partition , Betsy was looking worried again , and Gabby had started typing . " That lying sack of shit ! " " I did n't know he was writing a novel , " said Samantha , no doubt desperate to change the subject . " He can barely write a thank-you note , " I said , flipping back to page 132 . " I never thought of myself as a chubby chaser , " I read . " But when I met C. , I fell for her wit , her laugh , her sparkling eyes . Her body , I decided , was something I could learn to live with . " " I 'll KILL HIM ! " " So kill him already and shut up about it , " muttered Gabby , shoving her inch-thick glasses up her nose . Betsy was on her feet again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were M &M's; all over the floor , crunching beneath the rollers of my chair . " I got ta go , " I told Samantha , and hung up . " I 'm fine , " I said to Betsy . She gave me a worried look , then re-treated . It took me three tries to get Bruce 's number right , and when his voice mail calmly informed me that he was n't available to take my call , I lost my nerve , hung up , and called Samantha back . " Good in bed , my ass , " I said . " I ought to call his editor . It 's false advertising . I mean , did they check his references ? Nobody called me . " " That 's the anger talking , " said Samantha . Ever since she started dating her yoga instructor , she 's become very philosophical . " Chubby chaser ? " I said . I could feel tears prickling behind my eyelids . " How could he do this to me ? " " Did you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . " " Maybe you better not read any more . " " It gets worse ? " Samantha sighed . " Do you really want to know ? " " No . Yes . No . " I waited . Samantha waited . " Yes . Tell me . " Samantha sighed again . " He calls you .... Lewinsky-esque . " " With regards to my body or my blow jobs ? " I tried to laugh , but it came out as a strangled sob . " And he goes on and on about your ... let me find it . Your ' amplitude . ' " " Oh , God . " " He said you were succulent , " Samantha said helpfully . " And zaftig . That 's not a bad word , is it ? " " God , the whole time we went out , he never said anything ... " " You dumped him . He 's mad at you , " said Samantha . " I did n't dump him ! " I cried . " We were just taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea ! " " Well , what else could he do ? " asked Samantha . " You say , ' I think we need some time apart , ' and he either agrees with you and walks away clinging to whatever shreds of dignity he 's got left , or begs you not to leave him , and looks pathetic . He chose the dignity cling . " I ran my hands through my chin-length brown hair and tried to gauge the devastation . Who else had seen this ? Who else knew that C. was me ? Had he shown all his friends ? Had my sister seen it ? Had , God forbid , my mother ? " I got ta go , " I told Samantha again . I set down my headset and got to my feet , surveying the Philadelphia Examiner newsroom dozens of mostly middle-aged , mostly white people , tapping away at their computers , or clustered around the television sets watching CNN . " Does anybody know anything about getting a gun in this state ? " I inquired of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series , " said Larry the city editor a small , bearded , perplexed-looking man who took everything absolutely seriously . " But I think the laws are pretty lenient . " " There 's a two-week waiting period , " piped up one of the sports reporters . " That 's only if you 're under twenty-five , " added an assistant features editor . " You 're thinking of rental cars , " said the sports guy scornfully . " We 'll get back to you , Cannie , " said Larry . " Are you in a rush ? " " Kind of . " I sat down , then stood back up again . " Pennsylvania has the death penalty , right ? " " We 're working on a series , " Larry said without smiling . " Oh , never mind , " I said , and sat back down and called Samantha again . " You know what ? I 'm not going to kill him . Death 's too good for him . " " Whatever you want , " Samantha said loyally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in his parking lot . " " And do what ? " " I 'll figure that out between now and then , " I said . I had met Bruce Guberman at a party , in what felt like a scene from somebody else 's life . I 'd never met a guy at a social gathering who 'd been so taken with me that he actually asked me for a date on the spot . My typical m.o . is to wear down their resistence with my wit , my charm , and usually a home-cooked dinner starring kosher chicken with garlic and rosemary . Bruce did not require a chicken . Bruce was easy . I was stationed in the corner of the living room , where I had a good view of the room , plus easy access to the hot artichoke dip . I was doing my best imitation of my mother 's life partner , Tanya , trying to eat an Alaskan king crab leg with her arm in a sling . So the first time I saw Bruce , I had one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth wide open , and my neck twisted at a particularly grotesque angle as I tried to suck the imaginary meat out of the imaginary claw . I was just getting to the part where I accidentally jammed the crab leg up my right nostril , and I think there might have been hot artichoke dip on my cheek , when Bruce walked up . He was tall , and tanned , with a goatee and a dirty-blond ponytail , and soft brown eyes . " Um , excuse me , " he said , " are you okay ? " I raised my eyebrows at him . " Fine . " " You just looked kind of ... " His voice a nice voice , if a little high trailed off . " Weird ? " " I saw somebody having a stroke once , " he told me . " It started off like that . " By now my friend Brianna had collected herself . Wiping her eyes , she grabbed his hand . " Bruce , this is Cannie , " she said . " Cannie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Bruce , and stood there , obviously feeling foolish . " Not to worry , " I said . " It 's a good thing you stopped me . I was being unkind . " " Oh , " said Bruce again . I kept talking . " See , I 'm trying to be nicer . It 's my New Year 's resolution . " " It 's February , " he pointed out . " I 'm a slow starter . " " Well , " he said , " at least you 're trying . " He smiled at me , and walked away . I spent the rest of the party getting the scoop . He 'd come with a guy Brianna knew from graduate school . The good news : He was a graduate student , which meant reasonably smart , and Jewish , just like me . He was twenty-seven . I was twenty-five . It fit . " He 's funny , too , " said Brianna , before delivering the bad news : Bruce had been working on his dissertation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central New Jersey , more than an hour away from us , picking up freelance writing work and teaching the occasional bunch of freshmen , subsisting on stipends , a small scholarship , and , mostly , his parents ' money . " Geographically undesirable , " Brianna pronounced . " Nice hands , " I countered . " Nice teeth . " " He 's a vegetarian , " she said . I winced . " For how long ? " " Since college . " " Hmph . Well , maybe I can work with it . " " He 's ... " Brianna trailed off . " On parole ? " I joked . " Addicted to painkillers ? " " Kind of immature , " she finally said . " He 's a guy , " I said , shrugging . " Are n't they all ? " She laughed . " And he 's a good guy , " she said . " Talk to him . You 'll see . " That whole night , I watched him , and I felt him watching me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party broke up , and I was walking home , feeling more than a little disappointed . It had been a while since I 'd even seen someone who 'd caught my fancy , and tall , nice hands , nice-white-teeth grad student Bruce appeared , at least from the outside , to be a possibility . But when I heard footsteps behind me , I was n't thinking about him . I was thinking what every woman who lives in a city thinks when she hears quick footsteps coming up behind her and it 's after midnight and she 's between streetlights . I took a quick glance at my surroundings while fumbling for the Mace attached to my keychain . There was a streetlight on the corner , a car parked underneath . I figured I 'd Mace whoever it was into temporary immobility , smash one of the car windows , hoping the alarm would go off , scream bloody murder , and run . " Cannie ? " I whirled around . And there he was , smiling at me shyly . " Hey , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked me home . I gave him my number . He called me the next night , and we talked for three hours , about everything : college , parents , his dissertation , the future of newspapers . " I want to see you , " he told me at one in the morning , when I was thinking that if we kept talking I was going to be a wreck at work the next day . " So we 'll meet , " I said . " No , " said Bruce . " Now . " And two hours later , after a wrong turn coming off the Ben Franklin Bridge , he was at my door again : bigger than I 'd remembered , somehow , in a plaid shirt and sweatpants , carrying a rolled-up sleeping bag that smelled like summer camp in one hand , smiling shyly . And that was that . And now , more than three years after our first kiss , three months after our let's-take-a-break talk , and four hours after I 'd found out that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woman , Bruce squinted at me across the parking lot in front of his apartment where he 'd agreed to meet me . He was blinking double-time , the way he did when he was nervous . His arms were full of things . There was the blue plastic dog-food dish I 'd kept in his apartment for my dog , Nifkin . There , in a red wooden frame , was the picture of us on top of a bluff at Block Island . There was a silver hoop earring that had been sitting on his night table for months . There were three socks , a half-empty bottle of Chanel . Tampons . A toothbrush . Three years ' worth of odds and ends , kicked under the bed , worked down into a crack in the couch . Evidently , Bruce saw our rendezvous as a chance to kill two birds with one stone endure my wrath over the " Good in Bed " column and give me back my stuff . And it felt like being punched in the chest , looking at my girlie items all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up at the liquor store on his way home from work the physical evidence that we were really , truly over . " Cannie , " he said coolly , still squinching his eyes open and shut in a way I found particularly revolting . " Bruce , " I said , trying to keep my voice from shaking . " How 's that novel coming ? Will I be starring in that , too ? " He raised his eyebrow , but said nothing . " Remind me , " I said . " At what point in our relationship did I agree to let you share intimate details of our time together with a few million readers ? " Bruce shrugged . " We do n't have a relationship anymore . " " We were taking a break , " I said . Bruce gave me a small , condescending smile . " Come on , Cannie . We both know what that meant . " " I meant what I said , " I said , glaring at him . " Which makes one of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attempting to shove the stuff into my arms . " I do n't know why you 're so upset . I did n't say anything bad . " He straightened his shoulders . " I actually thought the column was pretty nice . " For one of the few times in my adult life , I was literally speechless . " Are you high ? " I asked . With Bruce , that was more than a rhetorical question . " You called me fat in a magazine . You turned me into a joke . You do n't think you did anything wrong ? " " Face it , Cannie , " he said . " You are fat . " He bent his head . " But that does n't mean I did n't love you . " The box of tampons bounced off his forehead and spilled into the parking lot . " Oh , that 's nice , " said Bruce . " You absolute bastard . " I licked my lips , breathing hard . My hands were shaking . My aim was off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . " I ca n't believe I ever thought seriously for even one second about marrying you . " Bruce shrugged , bending down , scooping feminine protection and shards of wood and glass into his hands and dumping them back into the box . Our picture he left lying there . " This is the meanest thing anyone 's ever done to me , " I said , through my tear-clogged throat . " I want you to know that . " But even as the words were leaving my mouth , I knew it was n't true . In the grand , historical scheme of things , my father leaving us was doubtlessly worse . Which is one of the many things that sucked about my father he forever robbed me of the possibility of telling another man , This is the worst thing that 's ever happened to me , and meaning it . Bruce shrugged again . " I do n't have to worry about how you feel anymore . You made that clear . " He straightened up . I hoped he 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maddening , patronizing calm . " You were the one who wanted this , remember ? " " I wanted a break . I wanted time to think about things . I should have just dumped you , " I said . " You 're ... " And I stood , speechless again , thinking of the worst thing I could say to him , the word that would make him feel even a fraction as horrible and furious and ashamed as I did . " You 're small , " I finally said , imbuing that word with every hateful nuance I could muster , so that he 'd know I meant small in spirit , and everywhere else , too . He did n't say anything . He did n't even look at me . He just turned around and walked away . Samantha had kept the car running . " Are you okay ? " she asked as I slid into the passenger 's seat clutching the box to my chest . I nodded silently . Samantha probably thought I was ridiculous . But this was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot ten , with inky black hair , pale skin , and high , sculpted cheekbones , Samantha looks like a young Anjelica Huston . And she 's thin . Effortlessly , endlessly thin . Given a choice of any food in the world , she 'd probably pick a perfect fresh peach and Rya crispbreads . If she was n't my best friend , I 'd hate her , and even though she is my best friend , it 's sometimes hard not to be envious of someone who can take food or leave it , whereas I mostly take it , and then take hers , too , when she does n't want any more . The only problem her face and figure had ever caused her was too much male attention . I could never make her feel what it was like to live in a body like mine . She glanced at me quickly . " So , um , I 'm guessing that things with you two are over ? " " Good guess , " I said dully . My mouth tasted ashy , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked pale and waxen . I stared into the cardboard box , at my earrings , my books , the tube of MAC lipstick that I thought I 'd lost forever . " You okay ? " asked Samantha gently . " I 'm fine . " " Do you want to get a drink ? Some dinner , maybe ? Want to go see a movie ? " I held the box tighter and closed my eyes so I would n't have to see where we were , so I would n't have to follow the car 's progress back down the roads that used to lead me to him . " I think I just want to go home . " My answering machine was blinking triple-time when I got back to my apartment . I ignored it . I shucked off my work clothes , pulled on my overalls and a T-shirt , and padded , barefoot , into the kitchen . From the freezer I retrieved a canister of frozen Minute Maid lemonade . From the top shelf of the pantry I pulled down a pint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed a spoon , took a deep breath , a big slurp , settled myself on my blue denim couch , and forced myself to start reading . Loving a Larger Woman by Bruce Guberman I 'll never forget the day I found out my girlfriend weighed more than I did . She was out on a bike ride , and I was home watching football , leafing through the magazines on her coffee table , when I found her Weight Watchers folder a palm-sized folio with notations for what she 'd eaten , and when , and what she planned to eat next , and whether she 'd been drinking her eight glasses of water a day . There was her name . Her identification number . And her weight , which I am too much of a gentleman to reveal here . Suffice it to say that the number shocked me . I knew that C. was a big girl . Certainly bigger than any of the women I 'd seen on TV , bouncing in bathing suits or drifting , reedlike , through sitcoms and medical dramas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated before . What , I thought scornfully . Both of them ? I never thought of myself as a chubby chaser . But when I met C. , I fell for her wit , her laugh , her sparkling eyes . Her body , I decided , was something I could learn to live with . Her shoulders were as broad as mine , her hands were almost as big , and from her breasts to her belly , from her hips down the slope of her thighs , she was all sweet curves and warm welcome . Holding her felt like a safe haven . It felt like coming home . But being out with her did n't feel nearly as comfortable . Maybe it was the way I 'd absorbed society 's expectations , its dictates of what men are supposed to want and how women are supposed to appear . More likely , it was the way she had . C. was a dedicated foot soldier in the body wars . At five foot ten inches , with a linebacker 's build and a weight that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team 's roster , C. could n't make herself invisible . But I know that if it were possible , if all the slouching and slumping and shapeless black jumpers could have erased her from the physical world , she would have gone in an instant . She took no pleasure from the very things I loved , from her size , her amplitude , her luscious , zaftig heft . As many times as I told her she was beautiful , I know that she never believed me . As many times as I said it did n't matter , I knew that to her it did . I was just one voice , and the world 's voice was louder . I could feel her shame like a palpable thing , walking beside us on the street , crouched down between us in a movie theater , coiled up and waiting for someone to say what to her was the dirtiest word in the world : fat . And I knew it was n't paranoia . You hear , over and over , how fat is the last acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our politically correct world . Date a queen-sized woman and you 'll find out how true it is . You 'll see the way people look at her , and look at you for being with her . You 'll try to buy her lingerie for Valentine 's Day and realize the sizes stop before she starts . Every time you go out to eat you 'll watch her agonize , balancing what she wants against what she 'll let herself have , what she 'll let herself have against what she 'll be seen eating in public . And what she 'll let herself say . I remember when the Monica Lewinsky story broke and C. , a newspaper reporter , wrote a passionate defense of the White House intern who 'd been betrayed by Linda Tripp in Washington , and betrayed even worse by her friends in Beverly Hills , who were busily selling their high-school memories of Monica to Inside Edition and People magazine . After her article was printed , C. got lots of hate mail , including one letter from a guy who began : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are overweight and that nobody loves you . " And it was that letter that word that bothered her more than anything else anyone said . It seemed that if it were true the " overweight " part then the " nobody loves you " part would have to be true as well . As if being Lewinsky-esque was worse than being a betrayer , or even someone who was dumb . As if being fat were somehow a crime . Loving a larger woman is an act of courage in this world , and maybe it 's even an act of futility . Because , in loving C. , I knew I was loving someone who did n't believe that she herself was worthy of anyone 's love . And now that it 's over , I do n't know where to direct my anger and my sorrow . At a world that made her feel the way she did about her body no , herself and whether she was desirable . At C. , for not being strong enough to overcome what the world told her . Or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in herself . I wept straight through Celebrity Weddings , slumped on the floor in front of the couch , tears rolling off my chin and soaking my shirt as one tissue-thin supermodel after another said " I do . " I cried for Bruce , who had understood me far more than I 'd given him credit for and maybe had loved me more than I 'd deserved . He could have been everything I 'd wanted , everything I 'd hoped for . He could have been my husband . And I 'd chucked it . And I 'd lost him forever . Him and his family one of the things I 'd loved best about Bruce . His parents were what June and Ward would have been if they were Jewish and living in New Jersey in the nineties . His father , who had perpetually whiskered cheeks and eyes as kind as Bruce 's , was a dermatologist . His family was his delight . I do n't know how else to say it , or how much it astonished me . Given my experience with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an alien from Mars . He actually likes his child ! I would marvel . He really wants to be with him ! He remembers things about Bruce 's life ! That Bernard Guberman seemed to like me , too , might have had less to do with his feelings about me as a person and more to do with my being a ) , Jewish , and hence a marriage prospect ; b ) , gainfully employed , and thus not an overt gold digger ; and c ) , a source of happiness for his son . But I did n't care why he was so nice to me . I just basked in his kindness whenever I could . Bruce 's mother , Audrey , had been the tiniest bit intimdating , with manicured fingernails painted whatever shade I 'd be reading about in Vogue the next month , and perfectly styled hair , and a house full of glass and wall-to-wall white carpeting and seven bathrooms , each kept immaculately clean . The Ever-Tasteful Audrey , I called her to my friends . But once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd been trained as a teacher , but by the time I met Audrey her working-for-a-living days were long past and she was a full-time wife , mother , and volunteer the perenniel PTA mom , Cub Scout leader , and Hadassah president , the one who could always be counted on to organize the synagogue 's annual food drive or the Sisterhood 's winter ball . The downside of parents like that , I used to think , was that it killed your ambition . With my divorced parents and my college debts I was always scrambling for the next rung on the ladder , the next job , the next freelance assignment ; for more money , more recognition , for fame , insofar as you could be famous when your job was telling other people 's stories . When I started at a small newspaper in the middle of nowhere , covering car crashes and sewage board meetings , I was desperate to get to a bigger one , and when I finally got to a bigger one , I was n't there two weeks before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been content to drift through graduate school , picking up a teaching assignment here , a freelance writing gig there , making approximately half of what I did , letting his parents pick up the tab for his car insurance ( and his car , for that matter ) , and " help " with his rent and subsidize his lifestyle with $100 handouts every time he saw them , plus jaw-droppingly generous checks on birthdays , Chanukah , and sometimes just because . " Slow down , " he 'd tell me , when I 'd slip out of bed early to work on a short story , or go into work on a Saturday to send out query letters to magazine editors in New York . " You need to enjoy life more , Cannie . " I thought sometimes that he liked to imagine himself as one of the lead characters in an early Springsteen song some furious , passionate nineteen-year-old romantic , raging against the world at large and his father in particular , looking for one girl to save him . The trouble was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no numbing factory job , no stern , judgmental patriarch , certainly no poverty . And a Springsteen song lasted only three minutes , including chorus and theme and thundering guitar-charged climax , and never took into account the dirty dishes , the unwashed laundry and unmade bed , the thousand tiny acts of consideration and goodwill that actually maintaining a relationship called for . My Bruce preferred to drift through life , lingering over the Sunday paper , smoking high-quality dope , dreaming of bigger papers and better assignments without doing much to get them . Once , early in our relationship , he 'd sent his clips to the Examiner , and gotten a curt " try us in five years " postcard in response . He 'd shoved the letter in a shoebox , and we 'd never discussed it again . But he was happy . " Head 's all empty , I do n't care , " he 'd sing to me , quoting the Grateful Dead , and I 'd force a smile , thinking that my head was never empty and that if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . And what had all my hustle gotten me , I mused , now slurping the boozy slush straight from the bowl . What did it matter . He did n't love me anymore . I woke up after midnight , drooling on the couch . There was a pounding in my head . Then I realized it was someone pounding at the door . " Cannie ? I sat up , taking a moment to locate my hands and my feet . " Cannie , open this door right now . I 'm worried about you . " My mother . Please God no . " Cannie ! " I curled tight onto the couch , remembering that she 'd called me in the morning , a million years ago , to tell me she 'd be in town that night for Gay Bingo , and that she and Tanya would stop by when it was over . I got to my feet , flicking off the halogen lamp as quietly as I could , which was n't very quietly , considering that I managed to knock the lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armchair , glaring at me reproachfully . My mother started pounding again . " Cannie ! " " Go ' way , " I called weakly . " I 'm ... naked . " " Oh , you are not ! You 're wearing your overalls , and you 're drinking tequila , and you 're watching The Sound of Music . " All of which was true . What can I say ? I like musicals . I especially like The Sound of Music particularly the scene where Maria gathers the motherless Von Trapp brood onto her bed during the thunderstorm and sings " My Favorite Things . " It looked so cozy , so safe the way my own family had been , for a minute , once upon a time , a long time ago . I heard a muttered consultation outside my door my mother 's voice , then another , in a lower register , like Marlboro smoke filtered through gravel . Tanya . She of the sling and the crab leg .

Full cheeks , round , sloping shoulders , double D-cup breasts , fat fingers , thick hips , big ass , thighs solidly muscled beneath a quivering blanket of lard . My eyes looked especially small , like they were trying to hide in the flesh of my face , and there was something avid and hungry and desperate about them . Eyes exactly the color of the ocean in the Menemsha harbor in Martha 's Vineyard , a beautiful grapey green . My best feature , I thought ruefully . Pretty green eyes and a wry , cockeyed smile . " Such a pretty face , " my grandmother would say , cupping my chin in her hand , then shaking her head , not even bothering to say the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty looming on the horizon .

And , worst of all , a clich , Ally McBeal and Bridget Jones put together , which was probably about how much I weighed , and there were two determined lesbians banging on my door . My best option , I decided , was hiding in the closet and feigning death . " I 've got a key , " my mother threatened . I wrested the tequila bowl away from Nifkin . " Hang on , " I yelled . I picked up the lamp and opened the door a crack . My mother and Tanya stared at me , wearing identical L.L. Bean hooded sweatshirts and expressions of concern . " Look , " I said . " I 'm fine . I 'm just sleepy , so I 'm going to sleep . We can talk about this tomorrow . " " Look , we saw the Moxie. article , " said my mother . " Lucy brought it over . " Thank you , Lucy , I thought . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , fine , fine . " My mother , clutching her bingo dauber , looked skeptical . Tanya , as usual , just looked like she wanted a cigarette , and a drink , and for me and my siblings never to have been born , so that she could have my mother all to herself and they could relocate to a commune in Northampton . " You 'll call me tomorrow ? " my mother asked . " I 'll call , " I said , and closed the door . My bed looked like an oasis in the desert , like a sandbar in the stormy sea . I lurched toward it , flung myself down , on my back , my arms and legs splayed out , like a size-sixteen starfish stapled to the comforter . I loved my bed the pretty light blue down comforter , the soft pink sheets , the pile of pillows , each in a bright slipcover one purple , one orange , one pale yellow , and one cream . I loved the Laura Ashley dust ruffle and the red wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bed , I thought , was about the only thing I had going for me right now , as Nifkin bounded up and joined me , and I stared at the ceiling , which was spinning in a most alarming way . I wished I 'd never told Bruce I wanted a break . I wished I 'd never met him . I wished that I 'd kept running that night , just kept running and never looked back . I wished I was n't a reporter . I wished that my job was baking muffins in a muffin shop , where all I 'd have to do was crack eggs and measure flour and make change , and nobody could abuse me , and where they 'd even expect me to be fat . Every flab roll and cellulite crinkle would serve as testimony to the excellence of my baked goods . I wished I could trade places with the guy who wore the " FRESH SUSHI " sandwich board and walked up and down Pine Street at lunch hour , handing out sushi coupons for World of Wasabi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe dead . I pictured myself lying in the bathtub , taping a note to the mirror , taking a razor blade to my wrists . Then I pictured Nifkin , whining and looking puzzled , scraping his nails against the rim of the bathtub and wondering why I was n't getting up . And I pictured my mother having to go through my things and finding the somewhat battered copy of Best of Penthouse Letters in my top dresser drawer , plus the pink fur-lined handcuffs Bruce had given me for Valentine 's Day . Finally , I pictured the paramedics trying to maneuver my dead , wet body down three flights of stairs . " We 've got a big one here , " I imagined one of them saying . Okay . So suicide was out , I thought , rolling myself into the comforter and arranging the orange pillows under my head . The muffin shop/sandwich board scenario , while tempting , was probably not going to happen . I could n't see how to spin it in the alumni magazine . Princeton graduates who stepped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they would then turn into a chain of successful muffin shops , which would then go public and make millions . And the muffin shops would only be a diversion for a few years , something to do while raising their kids , who would invariably appear in the alumni magazine clad in eensy-beansy black-and-orange outfits with " Class of 2012 ! " written on their precocious little chests . What I wanted , I thought , pressing my pillow hard against my face , was to be a girl again . To be on my bed in the house I 'd grown up in , tucked underneath the brown and red paisley comforter , reading even though it was past my bedtime , hearing the door open and my father walk inside , feel him standing over me silently , feeling the weight of his pride and his love like it was a tangible thing , like warm water . I wanted him to put his hand on my head the way he had then , to hear the smile in his voice when he 'd say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loved . And thin . I wanted that . I rolled over , groped for my nightstand , grabbed a pen and paper . Lose weight , I wrote , then stopped and thought . Find new boyfriend , I added . Sell screenplay . Buy large house with garden and fenced yard . Find mother more acceptable girlfriend . Somewhere between writing Get and maintain stylish haircut and thinking Make Bruce sorry , I finally fell asleep . Good in bed . Ha ! He had a lot of nerve , putting his name on a column about sexual expertise , given how few people he 'd even been with , and how little he 'd known before he 'd met me . I had slept with four people three long-term boyfriends and one ill-considered freshman year fling when Bruce and I hooked up , and I 'd fooled around extensively with another half-dozen . I might 've been a big girl , but I 'd been reading Cosmopolitan since I was thirteen , and I knew my way around the various pieces of equipment . At least I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Bruce ... was n't . He 'd had a few harsh turn-downs in high school , when he 'd had really bad skin , and before he 'd discovered that pot and a ponytail could reliably attract a certain kind of girl . When he 'd shown up that first night , with his sleeping bag and his plaid shirt , he was n't a virgin , but he 'd never been in a real relationship , and he 'd certainly never been in love . So he was looking for his lady fair , and I , while not averse to stumbling into Mr. Right , was mostly looking for ... well , call it affection , attention . Actually , call it sex . We started off on the couch , sitting side by side . I reached for his hand . It was ice-cold and clammy . And when I casually slung an arm over his shoulder , then eased my thigh against his , I could feel him shaking . Which touched me . I wanted to be gentle with him , I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine and tugged him off the couch . " Let 's lie down , " I said . We walked to my bedroom hand in hand , and he lay on my futon , flat on his back , his eyes wide open and gleaming in the dark , looking a bit like a man in a dentist 's chair . I propped myself up on my elbow and let the loose ends of my hair trail gently across his cheek . When I kissed the side of his neck he gasped as if I 'd burned him , and when I eased one hand inside his shirt and gently tugged at the hair on his chest , he sighed , " Ah , Cannie , " in the tenderest voice I 'd ever heard . But his kisses were horrible , slobbery things , all bludgeoning tongue and lips that felt as if they were somehow collapsing when they met mine , so that I was left with a choice between teeth and mustache . His hands were stiff and clumsy . " Lie still , " I whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm all wrong , are n't I ? " " Shh , " I breathed , my lips against his neck once more , the tender skin right where his beard ended . I slid one hand down his chest , lightly feathered it over his crotch . Nothing doing . I pressed my breasts into his side , kissed his forehead , his eyelids , the tip of his nose , and tried again . Still nothing . Well , this was curious . I decided to show him a trick , to teach him how to make me happy whether he could get hard or not . He moved me enormously , this six-foot-tall guy with a ponytail and a look on his face like I might electrocute him instead of ... this . I wrapped both of my legs around one of his , took his hand , and slid it into my panties . His eyes met mine and he smiled when he felt how wet I was . I put his fingers where I needed them , with my hand over his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and I moved against him , letting him feel me sweat and breathe hard and moan when I came . And then I pressed my face into his neck again , and moved my lips up to his ear . " Thank you , " I whispered . I tasted salt . Sweat ? Tears , maybe ? But it was dark , and I did n't look . We fell asleep in that position : me , wearing just a T-shirt and panties , wrapped around him ; him , with only his shirt unbuttoned , only halfway , still in underwear , sweatpants , socks . And when the light crept through my windows , when we opened our eyes and looked at each other , it felt like we had known each other much longer than just one night . As if we could never have been strangers . " Good morning , " I whispered . " You 're beautiful , " he said . I decided that I could get used to hearing that in the mornings . Bruce decided that he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we learned things with each other . Eventually , he told me the whole story , about his limited experience , about always being either drunk or stoned and always very shy , about how he 'd been turned down a few times his first year in college and just decided to be patient . " I knew I 'd meet the right girl someday , " he said , smiling at me , cradling me close . We figured it out the things he liked , the things I liked , the things we both liked . Some of it was straightforward . Some of it would have been raunchy enough to raise eyebrows even in Moxie , where they ran regular features on new " sizzling sexy secrets ! " But the thing that galled me , that chewed at my heart as I tossed and turned , feeling clammy and cotton-mouthed from the previous night 's tequila binge , was the column 's title . " Good in Bed . " It was a lie . It was n't that he 'd been some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was that we had loved each other , once . We 'd been good in bed together .
