<br> NewYork City <br> 2008 <br> " I just put hairspray on my armpits , " Carrie said . She told herself the shrill note in her voice was not hys &shy; teria . She was not losing it ; she had merely chosen to call her ex- ? ancT to tell him a funny story . He was one of her very best friends , and you shared the good stuff with your pals . " I was going for the deodorant . I kept thinking , ' Wow , this deodorant is sticky . ' Then I looked at the can . The thing is , I do n't know why I had hairspray  --  I never use it . It makes my hair look like a Brillo pad . " <br> " Carrie ? You okay ? " Howie 's voice came at her over the phone . And suddenly she was going to lose it after all . How the hell do you think I am , Howie ? My mother died ten days ago . <br> <br> Carrie drew in a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " You sure ? " Howie sounded worried  --  and not quite awake . What time was it , anyway ? " Why are you up at four-thirty in the morning ? " he added , answering the question . <br> " Oh God , I 'm sorry . I did n't know . . . " Explanations raced through her head . See , Howie , I 've been waking up a little early . . . No , the truth is , Howie , I ca n't sleep . I ca n't eat either  --  nothing except potato chips . I got into them when I was hanging around the hospital . . . She stopped herself . Because she was rambling . True , it was an internal ramble , but anytime she started wandering mentally it was a sure sign that she had lost control . And dwelling on the hos &shy; pital and her mother 's last days there was de ? nitely a bad idea . Carrie had gotten through the funeral Mass a week ago , and the memorial service the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of bed that morning and it had gotten her dressed  --  except for the hairspray/deodorant mishap  --  and now she was on her way to clean out her mother 's apartment . Although possibly not right at this moment . Not at four-thirty am . " Go back to sleep , Howie . I 'm sorry I bothered you . " <br> I am ? ne . I am Carrie Manning . I am thirty-seven years old . And , okay , I 'm a little tense this morning because my mother 's ... not alive anymore . But I 'm not going to dwell on that . Not now . Now , I 'm going to think about how I got through the memorial service yesterday without crying once . I was great at that service . I did n't even tear up when they sang the Panis Angelicus . <br> <br> " Carrie ? " Howie 's voice on the phone brought her back to re &shy; ality . " Honey , you 're not still freaking out about the ? owers , are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorial service quite as well as I might have . <br> <br> " I did n't freak out . I was upset . " <br> " However you want to say it , Carrie . . . " <br> " I put it in the obituary  --  ' No ? owers '  --  that 's what it said . It was right there in the New York Times . I listed all of Mother 's charities so people could make donations . " <br> " Yes , I saw that . " <br> " I did it exactly the way she wanted it . The woman was once voted Humanitarian of the Year by Living Life magazine . That 's what the plaque said : Rose Manning , Humanitarian of the Year , 1986 ... " <br> <br> " I know , Carrie  --  " <br> " Her wishes for her own funeral should have been obeyed . And I got it right . I got it goddamned right ! " <br> " Absolutely . " <br> " Everyone knows how Mother feels about ? owers . Especially roses . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " I guess there was someone who did n't know . . . " <br> " After the article she wrote about Guatemalan children ? The one about the ? ve-year-old kids who pick roses and wind up with respiratory diseases and blisters full of insecticides ? " <br> " Sweetheart , calm down . " <br> " You know what Mother says every time she sees those cheap roses in the delis on the street . She carries her pamphlets in her purse so she can show the owners  --  " <br> " She carried them . " <br> " That 's what I said . " <br> " No , you said she carries them . Wrong tense , Carrie . " <br> And suddenly it was real  --  in a way that it had n't been at the memorial service , or at the funeral Mass , or at the mausoleum . Now there was no way not to think about it . Her mother was gone . And Carrie was an orphan . The room went cold . There was a lingering scent of hairspray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me to come into the city and stay with you until my ? rst appointment ? " <br> " No . Thank you . " <br> " I could bring you some coffee  --  from the diner on the corner , all black and bitter . None of that Starbucks-wannabe stuff . " <br> " You 're the best ex on the planet  --  but I really am okay . And you need to get your sleep . You probably have a gazillion root canals today . " <br> " Only one . " <br> " Go back to sleep . You 'll need steady hands . " <br> And I need to get through this without dramatics . <br> <br> That was what her mother had called it when Carrie was a kid and her mother thought she was getting too worked up about something . " You 're being dramatic , dear , " Rose would say . " Are you sure you 're not trying to draw attention to yourself ? That 's ego , Carrie , and you must never indulge in ego . The nuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I wish I had listened . Just remember , you and I are just ordinary people . " <br> That had been a lie . Carrie 's mother had n't had an ordinary bone in her body . If you looked up " not ordinary " in the dictionary you 'd ? nd a picture of Rose Manning . And she never had to try to draw attention to herself  --  it came to her automatically . For years it was her looks that did it . When she was young , Rose Manning 's beauty was almost unnerving . Carrie closed her eyes and pictured her mother : the tall , slender body made for fashion  --  although by the time Carrie knew her , Rose was no longer wearing couture  --  the huge , green almond-shaped eyes , the high , sculpted cheek &shy; bones , and the creamy skin . Rose 's thick red-gold hair was always piled in a shiny mass at the back of her head , her mouth was delicate but somehow still full , and her nose was aquiline perfection . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ethe &shy; real and elegant that stopped conversations . And the magic had lasted for decades . When Rose died she was sixty-four , and until her last year when the cancer ? nally took over , she could still silence a room just by entering it . <br> But Carrie 's mother had always been more than just a breath &shy; takingly pretty face . She had possessed an internal power her daughter could never de ? ne or understand . Wearing one of her interchangeable skirt-and-blouse ensembles  --  she never spent time on wardrobe  --  and exhausted from a night spent volunteering at her homeless shelter , Rose could glide into a board meeting packed with Wall Street sharks and dominate . Carrie opened her eyes . <br> " Is it pretty out there in Katonah ? " she asked Howie . She and Howie were both city people , but after Carrie had canceled the wedding , he 'd relocated to the suburbs , saying he 'd needed to move on . Carrie could n't imagine anyone voluntarily not living in Manhattan , but since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't quite sure she could handle it if he were n't  --  she tried to be supportive . " I bet it 's pretty out there , " she repeated . <br> " It 's hard to tell ; it 's still a little dark outside . " <br> " Was it pretty last night before you went to bed ? " <br> " I guess , " Howie said . " There 's a big bush on my front yard that was there when I bought the place , and it 's starting to get all these yellow ? owers on it . The guy across the street says it 's a forsythia . " <br> " I 'm glad you 're happy , Howie . " And she was . Truly . Even though it ached a little to think that he could be happy without her . But that was only natural  --  right ? The real point , the thing to focus on here , was that he was still her friend , that he had understood that she backed out of marrying him for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two feet and she did n't want to in ? ict the train wreck that was her life on him . Howie , bless him forever , had understood the backing-out thing for the act of love that it was . " I mean that  --  about me being happy you 're happy , Howie , " she added . <br> " Thanks . " He paused for a second , then chose his words care &shy; fully , " Listen . . . sweetheart , why do n't you hold off on clearing out your mother 's apartment for a few weeks ? Give yourself a break . " <br> Because if I do n't do it right now , I 'll never be able to . <br> <br> " I 'm cool . Really . " <br> " Of course you are ! " he said , way too heartily . " I know that ! " <br> " Thanks . Night , Howie . . . well . . . good morning . " She started to hang up , but his voice stopped her . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it right , yesterday . You got the memorial service right . " <br> " Thank you , " she said as she put down the phone . But Howie was wrong . Carrie 's eyes shifted over to the doorway , where the basket of white roses sat on the ? oor . <br> " Would you like these ? " the priest had asked her after the service was over . What she should have done was to tell him , vehemently , to toss the basket into the garbage . But the ? owers were lovely , a soft off-white with just a touch of pinkish blush at the heart . In the days since Rose had died , there had been many speeches given about her . Her memorial service had been packed with people who had admired and respected her . But , per her instructions , there had not been one personal touch , not one moment in which anyone acknowledged that Rose Manning had been more than an icon , that she 'd also been a widow , a daughter , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something extravagant and beautiful  --  except the clueless sender of the white roses . <br> " Yes , I want them , " Carrie had said to the priest , and she had taken the basket out of his hands and brought the roses home . <br> I failed you , Mother . I 'm sorry . <br> Carrie stumbled through the obstacle course that was her bedroom . When she 'd ? nally left her mother 's apartment in her late twenties , she 'd been determined to create a cozy space for herself , and she 'd splurged on several large , cushy pieces of furniture . Unfortunately , she had not measured the size of the rooms in her small home . The monster bed ate up almost all of the ? oor space in her bedroom , so opening the bottom drawer of the bureau was impossible unless she was squatting in the closet . For bedding , Carrie had purchased eight white pillows and a white down- ? lled comforter . She 'd been going for Sensuous Luxury ; her best friend , Zoe , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room were more puffy oversize chairs , ottomans , and a sofa . Someone had told Carrie that putting a mirror on the wall above the sofa would make the room look bigger , and she had dutifully done so . The bottom of the mirror frame jutted out from the wall , so when guests sat on the couch they had to slouch or risk losing a piece of scalp . <br> Carrie carefully threaded her way to the bathroom . She looked at herself in the tiny mirror . She was not the beauty her mother had been , but that was not something she obsessed about . As Zoe once said , who the hell was as beautiful as Rose ? Even in a time when any woman with enough cash could buy the nose and boobs of her dreams , Rose had been in a class by herself . On the other hand , Zoe had continued kindly , Carrie was n't exactly a disaster . At ? ve-four , she was cute rather than regal , but she was endowed with fairly impressive cleavage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a little too long , her dark brown eyes were probably too deep set , and her curly hair  --  also dark brown  --  was always a mess by three in the afternoon . But her smile was fabulous . When she unleashed it . " Which you do n't do often enough , " Zoe had said , wrapping up her assessment . " You ca n't get away with your mom 's ice princess act . And it would n't hurt if you used a little makeup . " <br> Carrie searched around in her medicine chest and ? nally un &shy; earthed some seldom used blush and mascara . She found her lip gloss in her purse , managed to stall another minute or two with it , then went into her kitchen and dawdled over her breakfast quotient of sour-cream-and-onion- ? avored chips . But it still was n't six o'clock yet . For some reason she did n't want to go to her mother 's apartment before six o'clock . On the other hand , staying in her own apartment was out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for poor Howie  --  who 'd be awake at this hour . Carrie put on her coat and headed out the door . <br> Zoe was already up and working when Carrie rang her buzzer . Carrie knew this because when Zoe answered the door she was wearing her work clothes  --  ? annel pajamas with red roses on them and an apron liberally smeared with chocolate  --  and her blond hair was bundled up under a net . Since Zoe was six feet tall and skinny , the look was distinctive . She stood in her doorway peeling off a pair of surgical gloves and eyeing Carrie with the look of sympathy and concern that everyone had been giving her for the last year . <br> " Hey , Carrie . Are you  --  " <br> " New rule , " Carrie broke in hastily . " Do n't ask me how I am , okay ? " Zoe started to speak , then thought better of it . " And we 're not talking about memorial services , or funerals . " Or mothers . <br> <br> Zoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <br> " Not really . " <br> " Okay . Come into the kitchen . " <br> Actually , Zoe 's entire apartment was a kitchen . She 'd stashed a cot in one corner of it , and there was a closet where she kept her wardrobe , but the rest of her small studio had been gutted and ? tted out with two industrial-size refrigerators , a restaurant stove , a large table at which two people could work comfortably , and several huge storage bins full of sugar and cocoa . Stacked against one wall were shipping supplies , rolls of gold tissue paper , and cases of hand-painted candy boxes . Zoe was a candy maker who sold herb- ? avored chocolate truf ? es to the hippest gourmet groceries and restaurants in Manhattan . Since ? ve that morning she 'd been tak &shy; ing baking sheets covered with little frozen balls of the chocolate &shy; and-cream mixture known as ganache out of the fridge and dipping them into melted bittersweet chocolate  --  the best Belgium had to offer  --  before dusting them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ? avors such as lavender and rosewater , and in the case of one client  --  a Mexican restaurant  --  hot chili peppers . <br> Carrie knew all of this because for two years she too had stum &shy; bled out of bed at the crack of dawn to dip and dust truf ? es . That was when she had been Zoe 's partner in the business  --  a business they had started together and worked on happily , until one day Carrie felt the walls start to close in . She 'd begged Zoe to please understand that she still loved her but there had to be more meaning to life than candy . Zoe had argued that they were on the verge of landing their ? rst big account with a chain of trendy Manhattan grocery stores , which they had both busted their buns for , and Carrie would be ripping herself off if she sold out . Carrie could n't explain why she had to dump the business which had been her idea in the ? rst place . She just knew if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more piece of gold tissue she was going to start throw &shy; ing pots of chocolate around Zoe 's apartment . She 'd left the business , and six weeks later , Zoe , as sole owner , had landed the coveted account . Now Zoe could afford to hire people to help with the wrapping , although she was still doing the dipping and the dusting herself . And soon she 'd be reclaiming her living space because she 'd be renting a professional kitchen in Brooklyn . <br> As Zoe swirled the ? rst of the truf ? es in the coating , the hot chocolate released a whisper of a scent from the frozen ganache . Carrie sniffed the air . " Basil ? " she asked . <br> Intent on her candy , Zoe did n't look up . " It 's still the most popular ? avor , " she said . " Bean and Brown ca n't keep it in stock . " She placed the coated truf ? es on a piece of parchment paper and pre &shy; pared to start rolling them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She opened the cabinet under the sink where the hairnets and gloves were kept , and suited up . " It 'll go faster if we work together . " <br> Zoe threw her a funny look , but mercifully she did n't say anything . They worked side by side in silence , falling into the familiar rhythm they 'd established over so many mornings , until ? ve cookie sheets covered with ? nished truf ? es were back in the fridge . " You still have the feel for it , " Zoe said as they stripped off their rubber gloves . " You know how many people I 've hired and ? red over the last four months because they did n't have the touch ? " She hesitated , then said , " You know . . . if you wanted to , Carrie ... you could buy back in . " <br> There were a lot of people who would have been pissed about the way Carrie had split right before their big contract came through . But Zoe had known Carrie since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with follow-through . She 'd watched Carrie start and abandon a dog walking service , a vintage clothing store  --  this was with another , less understanding partner  --  and a brief , horri ? c career as a personal assistant . Now Zoe eased herself onto one of the stools that ? anked the work &shy; table . " I 'm serious , " she said . " Would you like to come back ? " <br> For a moment it sounded wonderful . For the last year , most of Carrie 's time , to say nothing of her available brain space , had been spent caring for her mother . Rose 's doctors had admitted early on that there was n't anything they could do for her , and faced with that reality , Carrie had set out to make sure her mother 's death was a " good " one  --  even though she was n't sure she believed there was such a thing . Rose had stayed in her own apartment for as long as the medical professionals would allow it , because that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were spent in the hospital . The ordeal had been so absorbing that once it was over , Carrie had found herself with endless hours she could n't ? ll . And she 'd never felt so lost in her life . If she went back into partnership with Zoe , she 'd have work , and a place to go every day , and ... And after two weeks she knew she 'd be begging to get out again . <br> Something ragged and painful started growing in Carrie 's chest . " The business is big now . It would be too expensive for me to get back in , " she said . <br> " You 'd pay what I did when I bought you out . " <br> The ragged something moved up into her throat . " You 're being too nice to me , " Carrie mumbled . And she wanted Zoe to please , please stop . Because she could n't take nice right now . Nasty she could handle , but nice was going to make her lose it . <br> " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she demanded belligerently . " I 've messed up everything I 've ever tried . I washed out of college ; I did n't make it through six months of culinary school . " <br> " But you came up with a great recipe for basil truf ? es  --  " <br> " I 've had God knows how many jobs and I 've quit every one of them . This candy thing is the third business I 've tried and dumped . I could n't even hang in with Howie and he 's got to be the sweetest man in the world . I am a complete and total screwup , and . . . " she stopped herself . " And why are n't you all over me right now ? " <br> " Why would I do that ? " <br> " I 'm whining and wallowing . Why are n't you busting me for having a pity party ? That 's what girlfriends do  --  we bust each other . Why are n't you telling me that I made those choices and I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <br> " Old rule , " Zoe said softly . " A girlfriend does n't bust a friend whose mother has just died . " <br> So Carrie ? nally lost it . She cried loudly for a long time . After she ? nally ? nished , Zoe pointed out that was probably the reason why she 'd come over . " And you had mommy issues even before Rose died , " she added . <br> " Not anymore , " Carrie said . <br> " They 're probably worse now that she 's gone . You never got it all cleared up with her , and you need to do that . You know ? " <br> Carrie did know . But she did n't want to start sobbing again . " Unfortunately it 's going to be hard to have a nice long talk . " <br> " You need closure , Carrie . " <br> " You really should stop Tivo-ing Dr. Phil . And for your information , I 'm getting closure . I 'm going to the apartment today to clean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <br> " Why does everyone keep saying that ? I can handle it . " Zoe looked at her . " I 'm okay . Okay ? " <br> After a second , Zoe nodded and pulled another tray of basil truf ? es out of the freezer . They dipped and dusted until it was nine o'clock and there was no way Carrie could tell herself that it was too early to go to Rose 's apartment . <br> " Can I ask one question about the memorial service ? " Zoe said as she walked Carrie to the elevator . <br> " Can I stop you ? " Carrie braced herself for another Dr. Phil moment . <br> " Did you invite your grandmother ? " <br> The question was a little worse than Carrie had expected . " I could n't , " she said after a moment . " Mother would n't have wanted it . " <br> " Do you think your grandmother would have come anyway ? " <br> " Why ? " <br> " I thought I saw someone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures I 've seen ... from the end of your grandmother 's career . " <br> " The way I understand it , if she had shown up we would have known it . At the very least there would have been an entire brass section . " <br> " That sounds a little hostile . " <br> " It 's just a fact . Everyone says no one could milk an entrance like Lu Lawson . " <br> Continues ...
