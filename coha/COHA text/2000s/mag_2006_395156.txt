Section : alternatives staying centered Moving on from life 's little ( and large ) lapses <p> Big decisions make me nervous . I 'm okay when it comes to ordering dinner or buying a new pair of jeans , but if I 'm selecting a house , a job , or even a mate , some part of me always wonders whether I 'm making the best choice . It 's not that I 'm a slave to perfection ( honest ! ) . It 's just that I 'm simply trying to steer clear of future regrets and the anger , frustration , grief , and self-blame that accompany them and make regret such an unwelcome , energy-draining emotion . <p> In the dark , long days of winter , it 's natural to spend time internally focused , looking back over our lives . Sifting through the past is how we find meaning , so we can enrich the days to come with greater wisdom and clarity . But sometimes this thought process turns on us , and regret takes on a life of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially true for people with seasonal affective disorder , a common type of depression linked to low levels of light . ) <p> Regret is one of the most felt but least discussed emotions . While directing a stress disorders clinic years ago , I became convinced that self-blame was one of the primary thought patterns that prevented emotional and even physical healing in my ( mostly female ) patients . Ruminating about how wrong or deficient you are ( How could I have been so stupid ? or What an idiot I am ! ) makes you feel small and ashamed . It pulls you out of the present and keeps you stuck in the past , destroys your peace of mind , and elevates the stress hormone cortisol . High cortisol levels , in turn , can undermine immunity , memory , metabolism , and even cardiac health . <p> The first step to understanding regret in your own life is to learn how it works . Cornell University psychologist Thomas Gilovich , PhD , says that regret comes in three emotional flavors : hot , wistful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out to be married ( and in some remote corner of your mind you knew that ) , you 're likely to experience regret as the " hot " emotions of anger , embarrassment , and irritation . When you think about how fast your kids grew up and wish that you 'd spent more time with them , your regrets will probably fall into the " wistful " category , where nostalgia and sentiment prevail . When you realize that you invested your pension with a con artist who skipped town , you may experience regret as helplessness and utter desperation . <p> Gilovich also found that short-term regret is stronger for actions you took ( you bought a fabulous pair of shoes that cost a week 's salary ) than for inactions ( you passed up those great shoes and wore your old ones to your best friend 's wedding ) . Conversely , long-term regret is stronger for actions and opportunities that you passed up ( that person you did n't date or the degree you never finished ) than for actions you took . <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key is to get its message and then let the messenger go . Here are a few simple suggestions that can help you move on from the specific type of regret you feel . <p> <p> When you 're obsessing over what you did n't do , take action , if possible You can complete the degree you started 20 years ago , write a letter to someone with whom you have unfinished business , or realize the dream of moving to Alaska that you set aside when the kids were young . On the other hand , Mr. Right , the man you passed over in your hurry to marry Mr. Wrong , may no longer be available . In that case , the best advice is : Let it go . And if it 's really too late to repair the past , you can still come to peace with an error of omission by changing your attitude . Social scientists have discovered that after we make a choice , we get more comfortable by rationalizing  --  bolstering it with what we consider to be good reasons . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whenever I had a twinge of regret about not acting fast enough to buy my dream house when it came up for sale on the cheap , I used a positive rationalization  --  I 'm so happy living where I am now  --  that helped me decide that losing the house was indeed for the best . <p> <p> When you 're obsessing over what you did , make amends Psychologist Gilovich suggests three ways to minimize negative feelings over regrettable actions . The first is to undo or remediate them , if possible . So if you took the money you were planning to save this year and went to Europe instead , you can do financial penance and save twice as much next year . That should even the score a little . The second method is to find a silver lining that makes the pain worthwhile . Your regret over marrying , and then divorcing , Mr. Wrong might be softened by knowing that you 'll never again settle for less than you deserve . The third key to reducing regret is called dissonance reduction . Dissonance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . Let 's say that you bought an expensive new car , believing that it had a very comfortable ride . But in fact , the car is a poor ergonomic fit for you and gives you a backache . So what do you do ? Find something great about the car that makes it worth the money despite the fact that it 's uncomfortable . Maybe it has a stellar safety record or a high resale value  --  or it just looks hot . By dwelling on its positive attributes , you reduce dissonance and adjust to having to put a pillow behind your back to get comfortable . That kind of wisdom-applied to every area of your life  --  is the best way I know to keep regret outside in the cold , where it belongs . Tips for fending off regret <p> <p> The things you did n't do are likely to cause the most regret . So when a great opportunity arises , consider gathering your courage , mobilizing your support systems , and going for it . <p> <p> Perform a random act of kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for something that you feel bad about but ca n't directly correct . <p> <p> Be a thought transformer . When an old mental regret pops into your head , substitute a positive image of the future you hope to create . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Joan Borysenko , PhD <p> <p> Joan Borysenko , PhD , is a psychologist , an inspirational speaker , and the author of Inner Peace for Busy People . www.joanborysenko.com <p>
