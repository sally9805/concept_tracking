( Time : Late 1840 's , the low down riverfront side of New Orleans . A pretty , black eyed , olive skin white woman , about 30 , dressed as an Africamerican slave performs menial household and yard tasks . Her clothing is period urban slave . In a genuine Mississippi delta style she variously sings , hums , hollers , slurs a traditional , slow tempo Africamerican spiritual , " How Long , Watchman , How Long . " Her singing matches her work pace . It is throaty , lusty , fervent , but remains an accompaniment to the performance of her chores . She speaks and sings in a genuine " black " dialect . For a moment she stops singing as she silently remembers something and moves to a musical sound in her head , something German , a popular dance song circa 1818 , perhaps some joyous music from a long ago wedding reception , now a dim , scarce trace of a memory that periodically careens through the unconcious like a comet and possesses her soul . The comet disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift to indicate an internal moment , a soliloquy .

She is passing by when she notices the singing slave woman , SALOME . She starts to pass by but is drawn back by something in Salome 's voice . Then she looks at her closely . Salome notices and grows quiet , a bit apprehensive . Karla comes closer and closer to inspect Salome . Karla is growing noticeably excited as Salome grows fearful . Salome never looks into Karla 's eyes . Always she looks down or away. ) p. 4 KARLA Step into the light . SALOME Beg yo ' pardon , ma'am ? KARLA Step into the light , please !

( KARLA knocks the broom from her hands , grabs her by the shoulders , tries to force SALOME to look into her eyes . ) KARLA Look at me ! Look in my eyes ! ( SALOME looks fearfully into into her eyes . Salome 's eyes flash a distant feeling of recognition , but then quickly averts her eyes to the ground . ) KARLA Listen ! We were four .

YOU HUSH AND YOU LISTEN ! LISTEN ! LISTEN ! LISTEN ! ( SALOME listens fearfully , silently , afraid to disobey a white woman , but fearful of not getting her chores done , confused , alien memories flickering faintly in the dense blackness of her past . ) KARLA You 're Salome Muller .

Remember how you said the water turned from ocean blue to all brown . Remember ? Remember how hot it was ? ( BITTERLY ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the captain cheated us .

KARLA I wo n't leave you alone . I 'll make you remember your past . ( KARLA stalks off , casting backward glances , incredulous , perplexed , caught in a deadly American conundrum . SALOME , shaken , fearful , sadly resumes her tasks . Tears flow as memories struggle to erupt . She sings mournfully as lights slowly fade to black . ) SALOME I ASK MY JESUS HOW LONG HOW LONG , WATCHMAN , HOW LONG WELLLLLL , HE DO N'T KNOW HOW LONG HOW LONG , WATCHMAN , HOW LONG I ASK MY MASSA HOW LONG HOW LONG , MASSA , HOW LONG OOOOOOH , HE DO N'T KNOW HOW LONG . . .
