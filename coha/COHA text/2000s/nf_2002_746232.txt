The conviction that the common teaching of the bishops was a sure guide for Christian faith goes back to the earliest centuries . In the decades since Vatican II , appeals to this category of common episcopal teaching , now referred to under the rubric " ordinary universal magisterium , " have grown dramatically . The author here documents the expanded appeals to the ordinary universal magisterium under the pontificate of John Paul II and explores the difficult theological questions that this practice raises . <p> ONE OF THE MOST significant contributions of the Second Vatican Council was its developed theological reflection on the role of the bishop . In Lumen gentium the council taught that preeminent among the bishops ' responsibilities was that of preaching and teaching . In their individual teaching bishops are " witnesses to the divine and catholic truth , " and the faithful should give to this teaching " a religious assent of the mind . " ( n1 ) The council then added : " Although individual bishops do not enjoy the prerogative of infallibility , nevertheless , even though dispersed throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and with the successor of Peter , when in teaching authentically matters concerning faith and morals they agree about a judgment as one that has to be definitively held , they infallibly proclaim the teaching of Christ " ( no. 25 ) . This text refers to the ordinary universal magisterium , a mode of episcopal teaching that has become a matter of no little controversy in the years since Vatican II . <p> The historical origins of the term , " ordinary universal magisterium , " have been amply documented elsewhere. ( n2 ) In this article I consider the expanded appeals to the ordinary universal magisterium that have taken place since Vatican II and , in particular , during the pontificate of John Paul Il . Consequently , my article is divided into two sections : the first briefly considers the growing number of postconciliar appeals to the infallibility of the bishops while dispersed throughout the world , and the second section attends to a number of unresolved questions raised by this new development . APPEALS TO THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE ORDINARY UNIVERSAL MAGISTERIUM : 1965-2002 <p> Explicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in ecclesiastical documents in the 1863 apostolic letter Tuas libenter of Pius IX . That teaching was adapted at Vatican I and with a few exceptions received only cursory treatment in various dogmatic manuals in the period between Vatican I and Vatican II. ( n3 ) Perhaps because of the conciliar definition on papal infallibility at Vatican I and Pius XII 's solemn definition in 1950 of the Assumption of Mary , most ecclesiological treatments of infallibility between the two councils focused on questions related to papal infallibility . Since Vatican II , however , discussion of infallibility and claims to its formal exercise have shifted to the infallibility of the college of bishops not while they are gathered in council but while dispersed throughout the world . This development needs to be considered in greater detail . Humanae Vitae <p> After Paul VI issued his encyclical Humanae vitae , a number of theologians contended that the Church 's teaching on artificial contraception had met the conditions set forward in Lumen gentium ( no. 25 ) for the infallible exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium . One such claim came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the teaching on artificial contraception had indeed fulfilled the conditions established in that passage of Lumen gentium for an infallible exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium . Kng 's intention , however , was to show that since modern scholarship had persuasively demonstrated the error of this teaching , the Church 's teaching on infallibility itself must be rejected. ( n4 ) His argument , roundly criticized for its questionable assumptions , has been accepted by few theologians . Several years later , John C. Ford and Germain Grisez published their much discussed study of the topic , concluding , with a quite different intention from that of Kng , that the Church 's teaching on artificial contraception had indeed been taught infallibly. ( n5 ) Their article precipitated a lively debate between them and several other interlocutors , most notably , Francis A. Sullivan. ( n6 ) In some ecclesiastical circles , the tendency has grown to accept the Ford/Grisez thesis : a disturbing reference was found , for example , in a vade mecum ( an official guide ) for confessors , issued by a Vatican congregation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitive . " ( n7 ) Ordinatio Sacerdotalis and the Responsum ad Dubium <p> It is under the pontificate of John Paul II that we have witnessed a vast expansion of official claims for the exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium . Perhaps the most significant and controversial claim for the exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium is associated with John Paul II 's apostolic letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis regarding the ordination of women . In this apostolic letter he wrote : " Wherefore , in order that all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great importance , a matter which pertains to the church 's divine constitution itself , in virtue of my ministry of confirming the brethren I declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the church 's faithful . " ( n8 ) His apostolic letter reaffirmed what had been proposed earlier in his own pontificate and in that of Paul VI regarding the exclusion of women from ordination to the priesthood. ( n9 ) Unlike those previous documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the theological arguments that the magisterium proposes in support of this teaching. ( n10 ) What was new in the 1994 letter was not the theological argumentation but the formulation of the teaching itself . <p> The phrase " to be definitively held " is found in Lumen gentium ( no. 25 ) referring to the infallible teaching of the ordinary universal magisterium of bishops . Thus , while the word " infallible " was not found in the apostolic letter , the use of that phrase raised questions , for the pope was proposing a teaching " to be definitively held " in what appeared to be an exercise , not of the ordinary universal magisterium of the whole college of bishops , but of the ordinary papal magisterium . This assumption was confirmed in the subsequent commentary of Cardinal Ratzinger published in L'Osservatore Romano : <p> In view of a magisterial text of the weight of the present Apostolic Letter , inevitably another question is raised : how binding is this document ? It is explicitly stated that what is affirmed here must be definitively held in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the interplay of differing opinions . Is this therefore an act of dogmatizing ? Here one must answer that the Pope is not proposing any new dogmatic formula , but is confirming a certainty which has been constantly lived and held firm in the Church . In the technical language one should say : here we have an act of the ordinary Magisterium of the Supreme Pontiff , an act therefore which is not a solemn definition ex cathedra , even though in terms of content a doctrine is presented which is to be considered definitive . In other words , a certainty already existing in the Church , but now questioned by some , is confirmed by the Pope 's apostolic authority . It has been given a concrete expression , which also puts in a binding form what has always been lived. ( n11 ) <p> Approximately 16 months later the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ( CDF ) on October 28 , 1995 , issued a Responsum ad dubium , a formal response to an inquiry posed to the Holy See . The inquiry or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul II in Ordinatio sacerdotalis regarding the ordination of women . The CDF 's response was brief , if provocative : <p> Dubium : Whether the teaching that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women , which is presented in the Apostolic Letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis to be held definitively , is to be understood as belonging to the deposit of faith . <p> Responsum : In the affirmative . <p> This teaching requires definitive assent , since , founded on the written Word of God , and from the beginning constantly preserved and applied in the Tradition of the Church , it has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal Magisterium ( cf. Second Vatican Council , Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen gentium 25 , 2 ) . Thus , in the present circumstances , the Roman Pontiff , exercising his proper office of confirming the brethren ( cf. Lk. 22:32 ) , has handed on this same teaching by a formal declaration , explicitly stating what is to be held always , everywhere , and by all , as belonging to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case with Ordinatio sacerdotalis , the Responsum ad dubium , far from eliminating theological discussion of the topic , dramatically increased it. ( n13 ) Evangelium Vitae <p> Earlier that same year , John Paul II issued his encyclical Evangelium vitae in which he explicitly appealed to the authority of the ordinary universal magisterium in his three condemnations of ( 1 ) the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent life , ( 2 ) abortion , and ( 3 ) euthanasia . According to the pope , the first condemnation was " reaffirmed by Sacred Scripture , transmitted by the Tradition of the church and taught by the ordinary and universal Magisterium. " ( n14 ) The second and third teachings were both " based upon the natural law and upon the written Word of God , as transmitted by the Church 's Tradition and taught by the ordinary and universal Magisterium. " ( n15 ) The official Vatican summary of the encyclical notes that in this encyclical the pope , " exercising his own magisterial authority ... ' confirms ' " a doctrine taught by the ordinary universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when conjoined to the claims made by the CDF regarding papal teaching in Ordinatio sacerdotalis , have raised important questions regarding the relationship between an exercise of the ordinary papal magisterium in " confirming " a teaching of the ordinary universal magisterium and the exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium itself. ( n17 ) Ad Tuendam Fidem and the Ratzinger/Bertone Commentary <p> In the summer of 1998 John Paul II issued an apostolic letter Ad tuendam fidem. ( n18 ) In this letter he incorporated several " commas " or insertions into both the Code of Canon Law and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches . This was intended to bring the 1983 Code of Canon Law into accord with the doctrinal categories established in the 1989 Profession of Faith and Oath of Fidelity. ( n19 ) In the Professio fidei three paragraphs were appended to the **25;562;TOOLONG Creed . The first paragraph referred to those teachings of the Church which have been proposed as divinely revealed either by the solemn definition of pope or council or by the ordinary and universal magisterium . The second paragraph considered those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed by the Church . " The believer must " firmly accept and hold " these teachings as true . I refer to these as " definitive doctrines . " Finally , the third paragraph referred to those teachings which have been taught authoritatively but not infallibly by the magisterium . The believer is to adhere to these teachings with a " religious submission of intellect and will . " I refer to these as " authoritative , non-definitive doctrines . " <p> The intent of the papal letter was to address a legislative lacuna . While the current Code of Canon Law already mentioned the first and third categories of Church teaching and specified " just penalties " to be imposed on those who dissent from these teachings , there was no mention in the Code of the second category , definitive doctrine , and consequently no mention of penalties for those who dissent from this second category . The prescribed " commas " corrected this lacuna . Of more significance for our topic was the commentary on the Professio fidei authored by Cardinal Ratzinger and Archbishop Bertone that accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal magisterial status , quite likely it reflects the mind of the pope and leads one to interpret this emendation of canon law within a larger framework . The commentary offered examples of definitive doctrines taught with the charism of infallibility : the teaching on the illicit nature of prostitution and fornication , Evangelium vitae 's condemnation of euthanasia , the teaching that priestly ordination is reserved to men , and Leo XIII 's declaration that Anglican orders were null and void. ( n20 ) None of the examples cited , however , would appear to be the result of solemn definitions but rather teachings proposed by the ordinary universal magisterium. ( n21 ) The inclusion of the teaching on Anglican orders drew the most attention and elicited widespread objections from ecumenists . The CDF Profession of Faith Composed for Robert Nugent <p> In the winter of 1998 , at the end of a protracted series of investigations into the teaching and writing of Father Robert Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick , Nugent was sent a profession of faith in which he was to affirm the Church 's teaching on homosexuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : dogmatic teaching , definitive doctrine , and authoritative , non-definitive doctrine . Of particular significance here are the teachings on homosexuality included in the second category . This section of the profession read as follows : <p> I firmly accept and hold that every baptized person , " clothed with Christ " ( Gal . 3:27 ) , is called to live the virtue of chastity according to his particular state of life : married persons are called to live conjugal chastity ; all others must practice chastity in the form of continence . Sexual intercourse may take place only within marriage ( cf. Persona humana 7 , 11-12 ; Familiaris consortio 11 ; Catechism of the Catholic Church 2348-2350 ) . <p> I also firmly accept and hold that homosexual acts are always objectively evil . On the solid foundation of a constant biblical testimony , which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity ( cf. Gn. 19:1-29 ; Lv. 18:22 , 10:13 ; Rm. 1:24-27 ; 1 Cor. 6:10 ; 1 Tim . 1:10 ) , Tradition has always declared that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Catholic Church 2357 , 2396 ) . ( n22 ) <p> Since I know of no solemn definition on the objectively evil nature of homosexual acts , one must infer that this teaching is being presented by the Vatican as a definitive doctrine taught infallibly by the ordinary universal magisterium . These two paragraphs are followed by three additional paragraphs , each beginning with " I adhere with religious submission of will and intellect to ... " thereby signaling that , in the mind of the CDF , what follows are to be viewed as authoritative , non-definitive doctrines . Included in those paragraphs are formulations stating that the homosexual inclination constitutes a tendency toward behavior that is intrinsically evil , that homosexual persons while deserving to be treated with respect and without " unjust forms of discrimination " can not claim any right to homosexual behavior , and finally that homosexual persons , " by virtues of self-mastery , " may grow in Christian perfection . <p> Nugent returned to Rome a slightly amended form of the profession ( e.g. , substituting " homosexual genital acts are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts are always objectively evil " ) and a concluding paragraph which read : <p> Regarding difficulties in determining whether a particular teaching has in fact been taught infallibly by a nondefining act of the ordinary and universal magisterium ( CIC 749.3 ) and while still acknowledging and affirming the authoritative and binding nature of such teaching , I will endeavor to maintain a positive attitude of prayer , study and ongoing communication with the Apostolic See on these matters . <p> The Vatican 's response to his final emendation is pertinent : <p> While its precise meaning is not altogether clear , the reference to " difficulties in determining whether a particular teaching has in fact been taught infallibly by a non-defining act of the ordinary and universal magisterium , " in the specific context of a Profession of Faith on the subject of homosexuality , can only be taken to mean that the author wishes to call into question the definitive status of doctrines regarding homosexuality belonging to the first and second paragraphs of the Professio fidei . The implication is that the status of doctrines of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this addition contributes decisively to the inadequacy of his Response italics in the original . <p> I will discuss later the implications of this exchange between Nugent and the Vatican . This survey of contemporary claims to the infallibility of the ordinary universal magisterium after Vatican II and , in particular , during the pontificate of John Paul II , while not comprehensive , should demonstrate the heightened significance given to this exercise of church teaching authority . A common characteristic of many of these claims to infallibility is that they concern church teachings that are disputed among reputable Catholic theologians . In what follows I address some of the theological issues raised by this new development . UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS <p> While the dogmatic manuals popular in the period between the two Vatican councils dutifully addressed the ordinary universal magisterium , there was relatively little sustained theological reflection on this topic before Vatican II . This changed dramatically in the last 25 years , largely because of the appeal to this exercise of episcopal teaching with respect to controversial matters . I would like now in this section to review several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal magisterium . The Precise Authoritative Status of the Teachings by the Ordinary Universal Magisterium <p> When a truth of divine revelation is taught infallibly by the ordinary universal magisterium , what results is , in effect , a " non-defined dogma . " The fact that such dogmatic teachings are " definitive " yet " non-defined " invites the question whether such dogmas are to be granted the same status as " defined " dogmas . Or , put negatively , does the obstinate denial of a non-defined dogma constitute heresy as would be the case with a defined dogma ? The Code of Canon Law offers an affirmative answer . Canon 750 holds that " all that is proposed as divinely revealed either by the solemn magisterium of the Church or by its ordinary and universal magisterium , must be believed with divine and catholic faith . " ( n23 ) In the following canon , heresy is defined as " the obstinate post-baptismal denial of some truth which must be believed with divine and catholic faith . " It would follow from these two canons that if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter to " be believed with divine and catholic faith " one commits heresy . Francis Sullivan has argued from this conclusion that since the consequences for denying a non-defined dogma ( the canonical penalties attached to the determination of heresy in canon 1364 ) are the same as those for denying a defined dogma , the principle articulated in canon 7493 that " no doctrine is understood to be infallibly defined unless it is clearly established as such " should be applied not only to defined dogmas , but to non-defined dogmas as well . He argues : " From the fact that the consequences for the faithful are the same whether doctrine has been solemnly defined or infallibly taught by the ordinary universal magisterium , I conclude that on theological grounds , the principle is equally true that no doctrine should be understood as having been infallibly proposed unless this fact is clearly established , whether the doctrine has been defined or taught by the ordinary universal magisterium. " ( n24 ) Sullivan 's approach , it would seem , is not to differentiate between defined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manifestly establishing that a teaching has indeed been taught infallibly by the ordinary universal magisterium . <p> Another line of thought , extending at least to the late-19th century , came to a somewhat different conclusion . Vacant published in 1887 one of the rare monographs on the ordinary universal magisterium to which I have already made reference . He wrote that the teachings of the ordinary universal magisterium , although taught infallibly , could not be considered as dogmas of Catholic faith . He based this claim on his analysis of tradition . He could find no evidence of the negative theological note of heresy being attached to a teaching proposed only by the ordinary universal magisterium . He specifically mentions the dogma of the Immaculate Conception , the denial of which , in his view , had never been deemed a heresy prior to its formal definition even though it had presumably been taught by the ordinary universal magisterium. ( n25 ) <p> Some 70 years after Vacant , Karl Rahner and Karl Lehmann in their article on kerygma and dogma in the theological series Mysterium Salutis also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the term " dogma " to its modern usage , there was a tendency to think of dogmas in terms of a solemn definition. ( n26 ) Rahner and Lehmann affirmed this tendency and noted the need to recognize the higher degree of certitude ( Gewissheitsgrad ) offered by defined dogmas . Recently Kenneth Kaucheck , a canon lawyer , came to the same conclusion : " While the ordinary magisterium possesses the same authority as solemn judgements , only a solemn judgement could define a teaching and only it determines that a teaching is actually heretical . Only in the denial of a defined proposition does one constitute oneself heretical . " ( n27 ) I suspect that the differences between the viewpoint of Sullivan and that of Rahner/Lehmann are not as significant as appear at first . Both viewpoints share a concern for the welfare of the faithful . Sullivan offers a stricter standard for acknowledging non-defined dogmas , and Rahner/Lehmann recognize that , in the tradition , non-defined dogmas did not offer the same degree of certitude as defined dogmas , at least as regards the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a defined dogma possesses a higher degree of certitude and that repudiation of a non-defined dogma would not constitute heresy , Sullivan 's argument would still hold that there could be grave consequences for the faithful should a teaching be mistakenly held to be dogmatic . <p> Surely similar concerns about the consequences for the faithful hold not only for non-defined dogmas but also for definitive doctrines taught by the ordinary universal magisterium . One of the most troubling aspects of the exchange between Nugent and the Vatican concerns the Vatican 's unwillingness to accept Nugent 's proviso regarding difficulties in determining whether a particular teaching has been taught infallibly by the ordinary universal magisterium . In his case ( and that of Gramick ) the consequences were quite serious  --  his failure to sign the prescribed Professio fidei has resulted in severe restrictions being placed on his pastoral and theological activity . It is my contention that not only is Sullivan justified in expanding the scope of canon 7493 beyond defined dogmas to non-defined dogmas ; its scope ought also to include definitive doctrine . Any claim to infallibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dogma or definitive doctrine , must be " clearly established " in order to avoid unwarranted and potentially harmful assertions of heresy or serious error and the canonical penalties that could follow . The Scope of the Object of the Ordinary Universal Magisterium <p> The relatively new category of church teaching considered in Ad tuendam fidem , definitive doctrine , yields a host of difficulties. ( n28 ) It is noteworthy that many of the recent claims made regarding the infallible exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium ( e.g. , the teaching on the ordination of women in Ordinatio sacerdotalis , and the intrinsically evil character of homosexual acts included in the Professio fidei for Nugent ) are concerned not with dogma but definitive doctrine . The expansion of such claims has been facilitated , in the minds of many , by a subtle reinterpretation of the scope of the category of definitive doctrine . <p> According to Jean-Franois Chiron , explicit claims to the exercise of the charism of infallibility with respect to non-revealed truths can be traced back to the 17th-century Jansenist controversy in which the magisterium was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation of the five heretical propositions held to be present in Cornelius Jansen 's Augustinus , but also in its determination that these affirmations were , in fact , present in the work . While the judgment of heresy clearly concerned divine revelation , the judgment of fact did not. ( n29 ) <p> The possibility of the exercise of infallibility with respect to non-revealed truths was affirmed in the 18th- and early-19th-century seminary manuals . After Vatican I , the explicit distinction between two objects of infallibility , the primary object corresponding to revealed truths and a secondary object corresponding to non-revealed truths , became common in the manuals . In some cases , the second category was defined quite narrowly as those facts necessary to defend revelation , and , in other instances , defined quite broadly as facts merely " connected " to revelation. ( n30 ) Vatican I did not address the matter explicitly in its two constitutions . However , Pastor aeternus , the decree on papal infallibility , stated that the pope defines " a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held ( tenendam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The use of tenenda rather than credenda suggests that the pope might teach infallibly on a matter not itself divinely revealed and therefore a matter not to be " believed " but " held . " Bishop Gasser , in his relatio offered to the council , made explicit mention of the possibility of the Church 's infallibility extending to non-revealed truths , but presents these as truths taught infallibly only to the extent that they are necessary to safeguard divine revelation. ( n32 ) Even so , both Gasser and the manualists after Vatican I were in agreement that the position that infallibility extended to non-revealed truths was not itself revealed but merely " theologically certain . " ( n33 ) <p> While Vatican II does not treat this topic explicitly , Lumen gentium states that the exercise of infallibility " extends just as far as the deposit of divine revelation that is to be guarded as sacred and faithfully expounded " ( no. 25 ) . The stress is clearly placed on divine revelation itself , as the extension of the object of infallibility is justified strictly in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theological Commission took up this question explicitly , opting for a narrow scope for the secondary object , which it described as those teachings " required in order that the same deposit may be religiously safeguarded and faithfully expounded. " ( n35 ) This interpretation was followed in 1973 in Mysterium ecclesiae , a pronouncement of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. ( n36 ) It is this narrow interpretation that , in substance , finds its way into the new clause that John Paul II had inserted into the Code of Canon Laws as canon 7502 : " ... each and every proposition required for the sacred preservation and faithful explanation of the same deposit of faith must be firmly embraced and maintained . " ( n37 ) <p> Against the restrictive interpretation of the secondary object of infallibility evident in Vatican I and II and enshrined in the canonical insertion promulgated in Ad tuendam fidem , an earlier passage in the apostolic letter , and an assertion in the Ratzinger/Bertone commentary , broaden the scope considerably beyond " matters required for the sacred preservation and faithful explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are connected to divine revelation by " logical " or " historical necessity . " This more ambiguous formulation had already emerged in earlier documents under John Paul II 's pontificate , most notably in the " Instruction on the Ecclesial Vocation of the Theologian . " ( n38 ) These more recent formulations signal a return to a broader interpretation of the scope of the secondary object , for there are many teachings which might have a historical or logical connection to revelation but which are not , strictly speaking , necessary for safeguarding revelation . This shift to a broad interpretation is unfortunate . How does one go about distinguishing teachings " logically connected " to divine revelation from those proposed as authoritative doctrine ? In fact , is there not a danger of collapsing the third category of church teaching , authoritative doctrine , into this second category by way of convoluted demonstrations of logical or historical necessity ? As Chiron observed in his careful study of the treatment of the extension of the object of infallibility in the tradition , " it has always been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the councils , of protecting revelation itself , and not of enlarging , more or less surreptitiously , the field of infallibility. " ( n39 ) <p> Finally we may ask whether this move to assert definitive doctrines taught by the ordinary universal magisterium reflects a return to a propositional model of revelation preoccupied with the enumeration of discrete propositional truths and the protracted elucidation of their logical and historical relationships one to one another . Yet was it not the thrust of Vatican II 's teaching on revelation , Dei Verbum , to effect a move away from this view of revelation and toward one which stressed the integral unity of divine revelation manifested not in a propositional statement but in a person , Jesus of Nazareth ? ( n40 ) As one distinguished commentator on Del Verbum observed : <p> The Council 's intention in this matter was a simple one .... The fathers were merely concerned with overcoming neo-scholastic intellectualism , for which revelation chiefly meant a store of mysterious supernatural teachings , which automatically reduces faith very much to an acceptance of these supernatural insights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express again the character of revelation as a totality , in which word and event make up one whole , a true dialogue which touches man in his totality , not only challenging his reason , but , as dialogue , addressing him as a partner , indeed , giving him his true nature for the first time. ( n41 ) <p> It would appear that what we are seeing today with regard to this new category of definitive doctrines , is not unlike the neo-Scholastic treatment of revealed truths criticized above . The Problem of Verification <p> Timothy Zapelena , in a dogmatic manual whose first edition was published decades before Vatican II , warned of the difficulties involved in verifying the consensus of bishops in the teaching of the ordinary universal magisterium. ( n42 ) Today it is commonly recognized that one of the vexing features of the exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium arises because no clearly defining act is involved . This creates serious difficulties for verifying that a given teaching has , in fact , been taught infallibly by the ordinary universal magisterium . The difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizes that the sought after episcopal consensus , past and present , can not simply be a matter of tacit episcopal agreement on a particular teaching . Lumen gentium holds that the bishops must be in agreement that " a particular teaching is to be held definitively ( tamquam definitive tenendam ) " ( no. 25 ) . This final clause suggests that there must be not only agreement among the bishops but an agreement that such a teaching is to be proposed irrevocabiliter. ( n43 ) One can not exclude the possibility that the bishops might agree upon a given teaching but hold that it was , to use the language of the theological notes , only " theologically probable " and not a matter " to be held as definitive . " How then , apart from explicit consultation of the bishops , is the note they assign to a teaching to be ascertained ? Sullivan suggests that " it is possible that some ordinary papal teaching , while not openly contradicted , might be given a rather passive reception or might even be qualified by a significant number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there not been significant moments in church history when a bishop or bishops may have lacked the requisite experience or knowledge to give a teaching any more than this kind of passive acceptance ? ( n45 ) <p> More serious are the difficulties raised by the possibility of a consensus virtually coerced by papal directive . One can admit that the Vatican prohibition of free discussion among the bishops on a particular topic might be prudent in certain circumstances . However , when such a prohibition has been imposed , any subsequent claims to episcopal unanimity on that topic will inevitably be compromised as such unanimity will appear as little more than episcopal acquiescence to a Vatican directive . <p> It is possible to conceive of ecclesial processes that might demonstrate a genuine episcopal consensus . In the life of the early Church , collegial interaction was manifested in numerous ways : by participation in regional synods , in the distribution of circular letters , shared participation at the ordinations of bishops , the sending and receiving of " letters of commendation , " etc . In these many episcopal interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starts , by the whole college . The common teaching depended on the support of episcopal communion . This explains the seriousness with which ecclesial schism was viewed ; schism isolated one church from the larger communio ecclesiarum and deprived the isolated church of the particular witness of the other churches . Today there are alternative opportunities to build up the common teaching of the bishops : collegiality manifested in episcopal conferences , episcopal synods , even the possibility ( all too rarely employed unfortunately ) of plenary and provincial councils , etc . Yet the potential for these institutions to facilitate a growth in shared episcopal teaching has been severely compromised by an atmosphere created by the Vatican in which synodal agendas are carefully controlled , treatment of controversial topics in letters of episcopal conferences is discouraged , and stringent litmus tests are employed for episcopal appointment . Bishops are told that they are not to voice publicly disagreements with current papal teaching . Such an atmosphere renders dubious any appeal to episcopal unanimity on controversial teachings in the face of evidence of widespread theological disagreement and private admissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of directly discerning episcopal consensus , Sullivan has also proposed two other criteria for discerning whether a teaching has been taught infallibly by the ordinary universal magisterium : the consensus of theologians , and the consensus fidelium . He finds his first criterion in Pius IX 's Tuas libenter , where the pope affirmed that an act of faith was due as well to those teachings proposed infallibly by the ordinary magisterium and " therefore are held by the universal and constant consent of Catholic theologians to pertain to the faith . " Sullivan writes : " In this final clause , Pius IX is clearly proposing a criterion by which one can identify doctrines that have been taught by the ordinary universal magisterium as divinely revealed : there will be a universal and constant consensus among Catholic theologians that such doctrines are de fide . " ( n46 ) Sullivan further emphasizes that such consensus must be constant . " This suggests that the kind of consensus by which we can conclude that a doctrine has been infallibly taught must be one that perseveres and remains firm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artificial contraception . For a time it was possible to recognize a theological consensus on the Church 's condemnation of polygenism , particularly in the years between Vatican I and Humani generis , but that consensus did not " persevere " among theologians after Vatican II . In like manner , a long-standing consensus regarding the Church 's teaching on artificial contraception was shattered in the years after Humanae vitae . In each case , an apparent unanimity dissolved in the face of significant new developments or new interpretive frameworks . I would extend this judgment to include both the teaching on the ordination of women and the moral character of homosexual acts ; both have been the subject of considerable theological reflection drawing on new interpretive contexts . Consequently , it would seem difficult to judge any purported consensus regarding these two teachings as one which " perseveres and remains firm . " <p> The second criterion Sullivan offers is suggested by canon 750 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law . This canon refers to those teachings that are to be believed by " divine and catholic faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ordinary universal magisterium " which is manifested by the common adherence of Christ 's faithful under the guidance of the sacred magisterium . " In this clause , an addition to canon 13231 of the previous Code of Canon Law , one finds a rare reference to the ecclesiological notion of " reception of church teaching " by the faithful. ( n48 ) As Sullivan suggests , the common adherence of the faithful is another way of verifying that a teaching has been infallibly proposed by the ordinary universal magisterium . <p> Sullivan 's attempt to develop a criteriology for the verification of the Exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium has come under some criticism . In particular , Lawrence Welch has accused him of introducing sine qua non conditions for the exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium. ( n49 ) After a lengthy analysis of Sullivan 's arguments , particularly as regards Pius IX 's mention of the consensus of theologians , Welch writes : " But there is no reason to believe that this Pope Pius IX , who insisted that theologians must subject themselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be not only a sign of , but a condition for definitive teachings whose absence would throw into doubt that the ordinary magisterium had taught a doctrine definitively . A sign is one thing , a condition is another . Sullivan seems to assume that sign and condition mean the same thing in this instance . " ( n50 ) As best as I can ascertain , however , Welch has misread Sullivan 's argument , for nowhere does Sullivan assert that either criteria are necessary conditions for the exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium . Rather , he recognizes that there is an important distinction between a factual instance of universal episcopal teaching to be held as definitive by the faithful , and the verification that such a teaching has been so proposed . It is possible for a teaching to have been taught by the ordinary universal magisterium without that fact being readily evident at a given point in time . <p> This is why Sullivan 's appeal to canon 7493 is crucial : " No doctrine is understood to be infallibly defined unless it is clearly established as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constiterit ) . " This canon is concerned not with establishing conditions for the de facto exercise of infallibility ( as did Pastor aeternus with respect to papal infallibility ) , but with the necessary verification that the exercise of infallibility has in fact taken place . Sullivan grants that the canon refers explicitly only to defined dogmas . However , he argues that it is theologically justifiable to extend the scope of the canon to non-defined dogmas . As we have seen , Sullivan 's primary argument is from the consequences to the faithful for denying such a dogma . <p> Germain Grisez has also challenged Sullivan 's position on several counts . First , he questions whether , in canon 7493 , constiterit ought to be translated as " established . " Grisez holds that the Latin bears a different interpretation , namely that " one should not judge that this or that magisterial statement is a solemn definition unless the very formulation and its context makes this clear . " ( n51 ) This canon then , is concerned strictly with the formulation of a dogmatic proposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be applied to non-defined dogmatic teaching of the ordinary universal magisterium . Curiously , Grisez does grant that in the case that he is arguing , that of the infallibility of the Church 's teaching on contraception , the faithful need respond to the teaching only as proposed authoritatively not infallibly . " For in view of the silence up to now of virtually all the bishops on the teaching 's infallibility , as well as the absence of consensus among theologians who have dealt with the issue , most of the faithful who lack theological training will be unable to see that this teaching has been proposed infallibly . " ( n52 ) <p> Grisez would then appear to accept , in part , Sullivan 's extension of canon 7493 to nondefined dogma , at least for the faithful , since , in the case of artificial contraception , the irreformability of this teaching would not have been clearly established for them . However , Grisez insists that the lack of consensus , significant for the faithful , does not hold the same significance for theologians themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find one 's views supported by many colleagues . Methodologically , however , this at best provides an unreliable sign of where the truth might lie . " ( n53 ) But of course , the point of appealing to the consensus of theologians is to " clearly establish " not that a teaching is true but rather that it has been taught infallibly by the ordinary universal magisterium . In this regard , establishing a consensus of theologians that a teaching has been proposed infallibly would seem equally important for theologians themselves as for the rest of the faithful . <p> Welch grants , against Grisez , Sullivan 's translation of the canon , but still holds that the canon is concerned only with evaluating the formulation and context of a purported solemn definition . Thus the canon is concerned with " clearly establishing " that a purported solemn definition does indeed meet the conditions for the exercise of infallibility by either pope or council . " Surely canon 7493 can not be applied in a straightforward way to undefined dogmas because they do not have the same precise formulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( n54 ) Still , Welch goes on to admit that " it remains true , of course , that when theologians try to identify undefined dogmas they must painstakingly inquire as to whether the Pope and the bishops have been in agreement that a particular doctrine must be held definitively. " ( n55 ) It is not clear why " painstakingly inquiring " whether pope and bishops have proposed a teaching as definitive by the ordinary universal magisterium is not equivalent to inquiring into the intention of a pope or council to offer a solemn definition . That the former task is more difficult than the latter is precisely the reason Sullivan appeals to the importance of ascertaining a theological consensus . <p> I contend that the problem of verification emerges whenever there are appeals to the teaching of the ordinary universal magisterium with respect to currently disputed issues . When appeals to the ordinary universal magisterium are made with respect to long-standing affirmations of the kind found in the baptismal creeds regarding , for example , the communion of saints or the resurrection of the body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachings are so evidently accepted as belonging to the apostolic faith . This may explain why , of all of the claims made in this present pontificate for the exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium , those made in Evangelium vitae have received the least criticism ; while moral theologians will doubtlessly desire clarification regarding the scope and the concrete application of the three condemnations found in that encyclical , there would appear to be a longstanding consensus on the general tenor of all three moral condemnations . However , claims made regarding both the prohibition of the ordination of women and the intrinsic evil of homosexual acts have raised significant questions precisely because many scholars believe that these teachings must be re-considered today in the light of fundamentally new interpretive frameworks. ( n56 ) Some ten years ago , I suggested that " in the face of controversy , the determination of the authoritative status of any teaching not solemnly defined can only be pursued tentatively .... Where serious questions are leveled against a particular teaching of the church , appeals to the ordinary universal magisterium can not be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the article discussed above , took issue with my conclusion . " Suppose , for instance , that some time in the future the resurrection of the body became a controversial doctrine as it was in the early centuries . Would we really be justified in saying that its definitive and infallible status would only be tentative because it had become controversial ? I would suggest that controversy or the lack of it is not really helpful in determining the definitive status of a doctrine taught by the ordinary universal magisterium. " ( n58 ) <p> My answer , however provocative , to Welch 's hypothetical case , is yes . The controversial status of that teaching would need to be resolved in one of several ways . First , there might be a well grounded demonstration of the diachronic and synchronic unanimity of the episcopate regarding the teaching on the resurrection of the body . Affirming the diachronic unanimity would involve a demonstration of a common witness to the truth of this teaching across the centuries while the synchronic unanimity of the bishops in the present moment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole college of bishops . Another alternative , with an ancient pedigree in our tradition , would be an exercise of the extraordinary magisterium to resolve the controversy by solemn judgment of either pope or , more preferable to be sure , an ecumenical council . After all , in the past the exercise of the extraordinary magisterium in solemnly defining a dogma generally occurred only as the result of a certain teaching having come under attack . As but one example we might mention Catholic convictions about the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , affirmed without controversy for the first eight centuries of Christianity before a series of disputes , culminating in the challenges of some of the Reformers , would finally lead to its solemn definition at the Council of Trent . Papal Confirmation as a Means of Verification <p> Brian Ferme joins with Welch and others in challenging the view of those who seek clear criteria for verifying whether a teaching has been proposed infallibly by the ordinary universal magisterium . While Ferme agrees with Welch that consultation of the bishops , the consensus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ferme contends that " the most important criterion seems to have been overlooked , namely the action of the Head of the College without whom it has no sense . " ( n59 ) The pope may exercise his own ordinary papal magisterium to confirm the teaching of the bishops . We have seen this papal confirmation at work implicitly in Ordinatio sacerdotalis and explicitly in Evangelium vitae . Such an exercise need not be problematic . As Hermann Pottmeyer has observed : <p> It is , in fact , very conceivable that the papal declaration could represent the end point of an intensive exchange between pope and episcopate : an exchange in which each bishop had an opportunity to make his views known . For , in the exercise of his responsibility as teacher , a bishop can not be replaced either by the college of cardinals or by the presidents of the episcopal conferences . Such an exchange can be carried out in such a way that the existence of a synchronic consensus becomes evident to the faithful. ( n60 ) <p> I believe Peter Hnermann has something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercise of papal teaching authority in which the pope functions as a kind of " notary public , " formally affirming/ witnessing the faith. ( n61 ) With this " notary " exercise of papal teaching the pope would be , not imposing a new teaching , but rather setting his " seal " on that which has emerged in the consciousness of the Church . The effectiveness of this confirmatory ministry would depend on its manifest character as confirmation rather than an autonomous determination . One would expect , for example , that such a confirming act might follow upon a direct consultation of the bishops. ( n62 ) An example of this kind of consultation is found in Evangelium vitae . In that encyclical the pope explicitly recounts his consultation by means of a personal letter addressed to every bishop. ( n63 ) Alternatively , there ought to be an obvious manifestation of an unbroken diachronic consensus of episcopal teaching in tradition that a teaching has consistently been proposed by the bishops as to be held definitively . <p> Such a papal teaching act would have the merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among bishops at the present time , the significance of which may not have been sufficiently acknowledged . Difficulties arise , however , when an act of papal confirmation proceeds as a means of resolving doubts regarding the definitive status of a teaching . Let us consider this further . Ferme contends that " if there is doubt as to whether a doctrine is proposed infallibly by the ordinary and universal magisterium of the Church in the sense of canon 7492 , then the Head of the College could declare this to be the case . " ( n64 ) This might be true if the doubt existed only among some individuals in the Church who , perhaps , never had cause to consider the authoritative status of a given teaching . It would not be appropriate in cases where there are serious questions among theologians as to whether a teaching has been so proposed by the bishops . In other words , however helpful a papal teaching act of confirmation might be , it can not substitute for lack of evidence either that such a teaching has been consistently proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now , offered as a teaching to be held as definitive by the whole college of bishops . To adopt the image offered by Hnermann , a notary affixes a seal to a document , affirming that they have witnessed the proper signature of a document . The notary transcends their authority , however , when they affix their seal in the face of doubts regarding the authenticity of the signatory simply because they themselves are committed to the contents of the document . <p> The source of the difference between papal confirmation as conceived by Pottmeyer/Hnermann and that conceived by Ferme is reflected in a statement Ferme makes early in his paper . In a discussion of the first two paragraphs of canon 749 he notes that these paragraphs address " two subjects of infallibility in the Church , " where paragraph one speaks of the first subject , the pope , and paragraph two speaks of the second subject , the college of bishops. ( n65 ) This view , however common it may have been in certain neo-Scholastic manuals , represents a defective ecclesiological perspective. ( n66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , as such , functions as head of the college of bishops , he and the college can never be conceived as two distinct entities and two distinct ( or as some manuals would say , " inadequately distinct " ) subjects . When Pottmeyer grants the legitimacy of an act of papal confirmation it is because he recognizes the role of the pope as head of the college within the college to sum up and give explicit expression to the sense of the college . Ferme 's failure to acknowledge this ecclesiological reality leads him to give the papal confirmation of these purported episcopal teachings an autonomous value independent of any direct evidence of the bishops ' teaching itself . Though it may be helpful , Ferme insists that the pope is under no obligation to " poll " the bishops ; it is enough that " in a deliberate discernment of the faith of the Church the Pope declares this faith . " ( n67 ) But if this is the case , since this papal confirmation is not , as Ferme admits , an infallible exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimately withhold assent from the pope 's determination if after prayerful reflection and study they fail to see the connection between the papal confirmation and the witness of episcopal teaching . <p> Finally , one should point out that this practice of papal confirmation risks obscuring what Bernard Sesbo refers to as the fundamental " dissymmetry " intentionally preserved in the teaching of both Vatican I and II : while there are two modes of exercising the extraordinary magisterium ( solemn judgment of an ecumenical council and the solemn judgment of the pope teaching ex cathedra ) there is only one mode of exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium , the teaching of the whole college dispersed throughout the world. ( n68 ) The word " universal " was added to the passage in Dei Filius precisely to make the point that the exercise of the ordinary magisterium that Pius IX had in mind in Tuas libenter was not an exercise of the ordinary papal magisterium. ( n69 ) Emphasis on the role of papal confirmation risks creating an unintended symmetry in which this exercise of the ordinary papal magisterium is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary universal magisterium . CONCLUSION <p> In the early Church it was commonly held that when the bishops proclaimed the apostolic kerygma , they did so in confidence that they were united with their brother bishops in the proclamation of the one faith in Jesus Christ . This daily preaching and teaching was the " ordinary " mode by which bishops exercised their authority as preachers and teachers . Only when a proximate threat was raised against the received faith was it deemed necessary to " define " the faith in a more solemn fashion , initially by way of councils , and eventually by way of solemn papal judgments as well . In the years since the Second Vatican Council , this basic insight regarding the significance of the common teaching of the bishops exercised in their daily ministry has been transformed into a vehicle for addressing controversial matters . A disturbing trend has emerged in which the authoritative status of these disputed teachings has been elevated by appeal to this " third modality " for the exercise of infallibility . There is a real danger that a too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may foreshorten the necessary discourse of the whole Christian community on questions being posed in significantly new contexts and therefore not susceptible to " definitive " determinations . Claims to the exercise of the ordinary universal magisterium have changed in significant ways . It is only in recovering the more ancient ecclesiological vision of the universal consensus of the churches and their bishops that the problematic features of this shift can be overcome . <p>
