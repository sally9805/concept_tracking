In a peaceful castle perched high above the Pedernales River  --  a castle , that is , with a turret , a crenelated roof and secret passageways  --  Robert Rodriguez is greeting his sons Rocket , Racer and Rebel as they emerge from their evening bath . Soon , perhaps after he whips up some beef tacos , rice and guacamole for dinner and plays with the kids a while , he will mosey down to the dungeon-dark studios he calls Los Cryptos and get to work . The sun is setting over the Hill Country outside Austin , but Dad 's day is just getting started . <P> " Nothing is more magical than the hours between 3 and 7 a.m. , " says the 35-year-old director . " Ca n't call anybody . Ca n't go anywhere . " This is Rodriguez 's idea of heaven , sitting up all night at two consoles where he writes , edits , designs costumes , dreams up sets and creates digital effects for his films while beyond the moat  --  O.K. , ravine  --  running across his 63-acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers at Miramax/Dimension Films are happy for him to work whenever he wants . That 's the luxury afforded by being cheap . Rodriguez made the first two Spy Kids movies for a mere $38 million each , even though they featured marquee idols Antonio Banderas and George Clooney , and they made nearly $200 million . " Robert does everything but act , although now he has his kids in the movie as well , " observes Bob Weinstein with a gravelly laugh . " If I were Antonio Banderas , I 'd be a little nervous . " <P> Nervous is perhaps how Weinstein felt five years ago when Rodriguez came to him with the idea for Spy Kids . After all , this was the former University of Texas film student who burst onto the indie scene in 1993 with the bloody Mexican action flick El Mariachi . Desperado , the 1995 Hollywood version of El Mariachi , had a sky-high body count but was in turn seriously outgored by Rodriguez 's next movie , the 1996 vampire pic From Dusk Till Dawn . His upcoming film , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is about a bloody coup . Weinstein 's response to the Spy Kids pitch : " Are you kidding me ? " <P> But the idea made perfect sense to anyone who knew Rodriguez . Born in San Antonio , Rodriguez grew up in a Mexican-American family of 10 and started making movies at age 12 with a Super 8 video camera , using his brothers and sisters , " little kids who you 'd think could n't even tie their shoes doing action and comedy . " These family-fueled shorts even won awards at some local film festivals . His sister Patricia Vonne says nobody was surprised when Robert became a filmmaker . " Dad 's Super 8 was always glued to his head , " she says . " It did n't even have a view finder . " <P> Spy Kids , then , was not so much a departure from violence as a return to his pet subject . Rodriguez had always idolized his uncle Gregorio , a special agent for the FBI . But it was n't until he was shooting Four Rooms with Banderas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in tuxedos , that the penny dropped . " They looked like little James Bonds , and I thought , Wow , that 's the angle . A spy family , " he says . " I can use my family 's dynamics and values , with the spy twist to give it some action . "
