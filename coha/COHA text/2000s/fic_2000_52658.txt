Section : PLUMAGE FROM PEGASUS " The Red Planet is really butterscotch . After an exhaustive review of 17,050 images from 1997 's Mars Pathfinder mission , astronomers are no longer seeing red in the planet next door . ' The red planet is not red but indeed yellowish brown , ' scientists concluded in a report yesterday .... " <p>  --  Seth Borenstein , syndicated news article . WHEN THE doorbell chimed I saved my pitifully brief story to disk and stood wearily up . Six straight hours in front of the computer , and I had managed to write only a measly thousand words . I , who had once been nearly as prolific as Lester Dent , reduced to a crummy four manuscript pages per day . But that 's just how things went for the average science-fiction writer in this new era under COSTIVE , and I tried once again to reconcile myself to the changed situation . <p> Still , I could n't resist glaring hatefully at the stacks of creativity-inhibiting reference books around my work station before I turned to answer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your typical attache-toting bureaucrat : as physically unimpressive as an unweaned kitten , yet radiating a glow of self-satisfied power . <p> " Nelson Nibbler . I 'm here on behalf of COSTIVE . " <p> Nibbler flashed his ID , and I flinched involuntarily at the logo I had come to detest : an optical microscope focused on the open pages of a book , above the legend CONSORTIUM OF STORY TELLERS INSISTING ON VERISIMILAR EXACTITUDE . <p> " I suppose I have to invite you in . " <p> Nibbler smirked . " According to the latest bylaws of SFWA , to which organization you currently belong  --  yes , you do . " <p> " Come in , then . But I ca n't spare you much time . I 'm trying to finish a short story for a new Marty Greenberg anthology , Thrilling Tales of Quantum Chromodynamits . " <p> Nibbler stepped boldly inside , and I conducted him to the most uncomfortable chair in the house . " I wo n't take much of your time . I just need to go over some revisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' <p> " It 's the one Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois selected for their new reprint volume , Patents ! I believe you titled it ' Vandals of the Hyperspace Barrens . ' " <p> " Yes , that 's one of mine . But I wrote that story ten years ago , before COSTIVE ever existed . I understood that old stories were exempt from COSTIVE regulations . " <p> " You have n't been keeping up with the decisions of your own writer 's union , I 'm afraid . Reprints are no longer grandfathered . They need to be brought retroactively up to COSTIVE standards . ' <p> I tried to quell my temper . " You 're telling me that not only do I have to inhibit the style , themes and speculations in all my new fiction , but that I have to go back and revise any older work of mine that 's up for reprinting ? ' " Precisely . " <p> " Does this apply to everyone ? " <p> " Of course . Have n't you seen the new edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung my head in defeat . Nibbler tried to console me . " It 's just what the readers demand nowadays . They 've grown used to scientific accuracy in their stories since COSTIVE was formed . And think of the students ! How could your stories be used in classrooms if they were n't completely accurate ? Are n't you happy about all those increased royalties from textbook sales ? " <p> I exploded . " It 's not worth the emotional and creative pain ! These regulations of yours have given even Hal Clement a nervous breakdown ! They made Robert Forward move to Russia ! Greg Bear now has a heroin habit , and Stephen Baxter is writing for Coronation Street ! Greg Benford lives like a hermit inside the Nuclear Waste Repository ! But the worst of it is what you guys did to Bruce Sterling ! " <p> Nibbler grew defensive . " We were not responsible for Mr. Sterling running amok . Simply scheduling him for a mandatory six-week re-education camp on the technicalities of piloting ultralight aircraft was no justification for him climbing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You folks practically murdered poor Bruce ! " <p> " Come , come now , we 're not that bad . We only have the best interests of the field at heart . Let 's step through the revisions of your own story one by one , and you 'll see how easy it is . " Nibbler took a xerox of my old story out of his briefcase and smoothed it out on his lap . " Let 's consider the title first . We propose changing it to ' Some Tentative Speculations Regarding Sub-Planckian Travel Involving Metric Strains . ' " <p> I stared incredulously at my tormentor . " Now that has real zing . " <p> Nibbler red-pencilled a checkmark next to the title . " I 'm glad you like it . That 's my salient contribution . The other committee members gave me a round of applause for that one . " <p> " Mister Nibbler , tell me , please : exactly what is your own academic background ? " <p> " I have six advanced degrees in subjects ranging from cosmology to paleontology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May I continue ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> " In the first paragraph , you describe your heroine as possessing ' a waterfall of hair black as the Coal sack Nebula . ' Now , you should know perfectly well that the nebula in question actually radiates at a large number of wavelengths including the visible . The simile is scientifically inexact . We propose this correction : ' no less than 28 centimeters of hair possessing the reflective qualities of refined graphite plus or minus an order of magnitude . ' What do you think ? " <p> " It 's charming . Any woman would fall into your arms with sweet talk like that . Go for it . " <p> Completely oblivious to my irony , Nibbler smiled and continued . " On page three , , you first describe hyperspace as ' an uncanny otherworld , a violent conglomeration of sense-twisting hallucinatory whorls and streamers , a maelstrom of nauseating otherness . ' Can you cite any studies from peer-reviewed scientific journals supporting this description ? " <p> " Of course not ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story ! The drama , man , the drama of it ! " <p> " As we thought . In that case , we 're going to have to amend that passage to ' a hypothetical landscape whose qualitative essentials have yet to be determined . ' " <p> I slumped in my chair . " Vivid , very vivid . I can almost see the film version now . " <p> " Ah , if only Hollywood still existed ! What a role we could have played in straightening out their mistakes ! Now , let 's take a look at these equations we 'd like you to insert  --  " <p> My temper had reached its limits . " Equations ! I 'll show you equations ! Do you know ' eff equals em ay ' ? " <p> " Of course  --  " <p> I hauled Nibbler up by his shirt . " Well , here 's the force of my foot on the mass of your ass , sending you accelerating out of here ! " <p> After slamming the door on Nibbler , I went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started a new one with the title " Sweet , Wonderful Surrender , " involving a woman named Britanny , the beautiful young heiress of a cosmetics empire , and the complications of her romantic life . <p> And I gave her a waterfall of hair as red as good old Mars . <p> ILLUSTRATION ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> <p> By Paul Di Filippo <p>
