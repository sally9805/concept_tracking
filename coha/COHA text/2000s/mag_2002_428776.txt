You do n't have to be famous . You do n't have to pull people from burning buildings . There are little ways to be heroic in everyday life . Plus : Real heroes tell how they got that way . // When the first plane hit , Victoria Cross Kelly was in the middle of a breakfast meeting on the concourse level , below ground , at the World Trade Center . Kelly , deputy director of the PATH rail system that links New Jersey and New York City , had no idea what had happened . But she and her colleagues knew something was seriously wrong when they saw people stampeding out of the building . She hurried up an escalator to a street exit and saw a blizzard of paper- " My first thought was of a ticker-tape parade " - and more people running . " I figured I really needed to get back downstairs and get in touch with the PATH train master , " Kelly says . Police officers were pushing people out of the building , yelling , " Go ! Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right around and headed for the phone that would give her a direct line to the man running the trains . She quickly described what she was seeing , and they decided to halt or reroute all service to the trade center . Everyone-from her colleagues to the governor of New Jersey  --  credits Kelly , 49 , with helping to save thousands of rush-hour commuters from the death trap the World Trade Center would become . Though this was her second brush with disaster there-she was working at the trade center when it was bombed in 1993 and six of her coworkers were killed-Kelly remained astonishingly cool . She knew she could n't leave yet . Her call had stopped the incoming trains , but two more were just entering the station . And so , while chaos reigned and a second plane slammed into the south tower , Kelly anxiously waited below street level until she was certain that every PATH passenger-some 1,500 to 2,000 people-had been safely evacuated from the station . " I was n't thinking about much at that point except wanting to be sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says now . " I really was n't thinking about me or what was happening . " Only when Kelly left at around 9:15 A.M. and started walking north , wondering how she was going to get back to her New Jersey office , did she see that both towers were on fire . A few blocks later , she stopped to get a glass of water at a restaurant . From a television there , she finally learned the full horror of the morning . And finally , she says , she felt fear . Photograph Photograph PATH Deputy Director Victoria Cross Kelly : staying cool , saving lives // Her husband had to tell their seven-year-old daughter what had happened ; with all the emergency planning that needed to be done , Kelly did n't get home from PATH headquarters until 2:00 A.M. the next day . " My daughter was mostly upset about my working nights for a week , " she says . " She did n't see me much . I would stop by her school on my way home from work just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station was buried under tons of rubble . Weeks later , police surveying the scene found an empty train that had been badly damaged , several of its cars flattened by the collapse of the south tower . Mercifully , no one was inside . THE TODDLERS AT THE CHILDREN 'S WORLD Learning Center in the Pentagon were n't afraid when the alarm sounded at 9:45 A.M. They were used to monthly evacuation drills . But their teachers knew better . Shirley Allen , 46 , the day-care facility 's director , had been in her office when she got the news about the twin towers . She turned on the TV . As she picked up the phone to call military protective services , Allen heard " the big boom-the sound and the impact , " and then saw , outside her window , the look on the face of an arriving teacher who was witnessing the explosion of Flight 77 as it plowed into the Pentagon . Allen 's heart was pounding . " I automatically thought , Oh , they 've hit us ! They 've hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was almost as if it were a big mushroom cloud . I 'd never seen that much smoke in my life . " She headed back inside and immediately took charge of evacuating the kids-straight into the path of thousands of Pentagon workers running from the blast . " That was a challenge , " she says . Teachers were struggling to push the evacuation cribs that held the littlest children ( some as young as eight weeks ) over the bumpy grass . Frantic parents began to appear , rushing up to get their kids . The group was moved five times , farther and farther away from the Pentagon . " It was amazing , " Allen remembers , " but the children were calm . They held on to their teachers ' hands , they stayed together , and they played between being moved . " Still , Allen says , " I was frightened " - not least because she did n't know if there would be other attacks . She was also worried about her husband of 24 years , who works in telecommunications at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she managed to reach him by cell phone . ) " All these things were running around in my mind , but the children were our priority-all the babies we have in here . Because they are babies . Even if they are three , four , five . They 're helpless , they 're sweet , and I 'm here to protect them . " The last of Allen 's " babies " was safely delivered into his mother 's arms at about six that night . But weeks later , Allen is struggling to deal with the experience . " I still think it 's a bad dream , and I 'm trying to wake up . " AMERICA NEEDED HEROES THAT DAY , AND WE GOT them : the firefighters , the cops , the rescue workers ; the nurses , teachers , and volunteers at relief centers . The first police officer to call in the news of the disaster was a woman , Moira Smith of the thirteenth precinct in Manhattan . The mother of a two-year-old girl , Smith went into the north tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't make it . The rest of us watched with pride and wondered : How would I have done in their shoes ? Would I have been helping the people around me-or running for my life ? Gordon Livingston , M.D. , a Maryland psychiatrist who served in Vietnam , does n't believe there are any indicators for who will perform heroically in times of high stress . " The people who , when most are just trying to get out of danger , crawl out into the line of fire ... if you ask them about it , they 'll say , It seemed like the thing to do . ' It 's hard to pick them out ahead of time . They 're not the biggest or the most aggressive . " Somehow , most of us do better in a crisis than we think we would . Mothers are capable of superhuman courage when their children are threatened . Even teenagers , barely beyond childhood themselves , have shown tremendous bravery in the face of danger . After being in a couple of life-threatening situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own hidden reserves . " I 'm very calm and able to keep it together for as long as I need to in an emergency , " she says . " Then I fall apart later . " Jennifer Petrillo , 30 , and her mother , Cathy Nash , 50 , are licensed practical nurses in Brooklyn who care for housebound patients . When they saw the disaster on TV , they headed across the Brooklyn Bridge toward ground zero as thousands were fleeing in the opposite direction . What Petrillo found on the other side , she says , " did not look like Manhattan . " The smoke was so thick it was difficult to breathe , and particles of glass and concrete were floating in the air . " I thought , My goodness , how am I going to do this ? " But for the next 13 hours , mother and daughter gave saline eyewashes and oxygen to exhausted , dust-choked , near-blind firefighters . Buildings were collapsing , debris was falling . " At times I was really scared , " Petrillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't think about those things . " Adds Nash , " I do n't know what kept me going . It must have been sheer adrenaline . It was all so surreal . " Flight attendant Sandy Bradshaw could n't have imagined her bravery on board United Flight 93 , which crashed in Pennsylvania after the passengers decided to fight the hijackers . Bradshaw called her husband from the doomed plane , told him she loved him and their children , and said , " We 're all back here getting hot water together and getting ready to take over the plane . " Photograph Pentagon day-care director Shirley Allen : protecting her " babies " // The courage we saw on September 11 was unmistakable , as clearly defined as the evil that provoked it . Heroism , we learned that day , is not a matter of talent or physical ability or fame . ( We may not remember the names of the dead firefighters ; we will always remember what they did . ) It is about acting in service of others and , many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in ancient civilizations that glorified warriors and martyrs . In these times , few of us ( if we 're lucky ) will ever face the life-or-death choices that come with combat , disaster , or persecution . But daily life provides constant tests of moral and emotional courage . " It 's so important that women see that the heroic quest is about becoming , and being , your best self , " says Kathleen Noble , a psychologist who teaches at the University of Washington and is the author of a book about women and heroism . " It is n't something only possible for the chosen few . " There is unsung heroism in many private lives . Says Dr. Livingston : " Talk to bereaved parents , people who 've suffered loss and continue to function . People who deal with severe handicaps or have family members with severe handicaps .. this kind of day-today bravery has received very little recognition . " Carole Straw , a history professor who teaches a course on heroes and heroines at Mount Holyoke College , sees a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great everyday heroism and self-sacrifice of a woman working two or three jobs to put her children through school , the woman who tends the sick and needy , or the woman who has devoted much of her life to the education of the underprivileged . " Now , though , we may be more inclined to see this generosity of spirit for what it is . In the days and weeks following September 11 , the volunteers who dished out meals and supplies and comfort to the rescue workers were doing in a public arena what women have been doing privately forever , notes Anne Bolles  --  Beaven , an Episcopal priest in New Jersey . " Women have always been making the sandwiches , getting the clothes , whether at ground zero or in their local community food bank or at home . So in a way , we see a recognition that when the chips are down , these are things that matter . " ANOTHER THING THAT MATTERS Photograph brave beyond her years heroes have young faces too . Fourteen-year-old Amanda Valance had no idea that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when her friend was in need , Amanda had the right stuff . The moonlit sky cast a shimmery glow over Little Lake Conway in Orlando as Amanda and pal Edna Wilks , also 14 , floated on boogie boards . Accompanied by four friends , the teens paddled out about 40 yards from shore . Edna was drifting with her arms dangling in the warm water when she suddenly felt a strong squeeze on her lower left arm . One of the guys must be playing a trick on me , Edna thought . But this was no game . Edna looked down and let out a piercing scream : An 11 - foot- long alligator was staring back at her , with its jaws clamped around her arm . She thought , This is how I 'm going to die . Within seconds , the gator pulled her underwater , spinning her furiously . Edna 's shriek sent everyone scrambling toward shore . Except Amanda . " I heard Edna scream , " she recalls , " and it was just so awful . It was like a scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger , Amanda says , " I just could not have lived with myself if I had left her . " As Amanda scanned the dark waters in search of Edna , the alligator came up for air . Edna 's screams shattered the night silence again as she used her right hand to try and pry the gator 's jaws from her left arm . The vicious reptile retreated , and Amanda immediately paddled over to Edna . " There was blood everywhere , " Amanda recalls , " and her left arm was totally mangled . We could see the alligator swimming around . I was so scared he was going to attack both of us , but I knew I had to get Edna to shore . " Amanda handed her boogie board to Edna . She swam beside Edna and pushed her-while keeping an eye out for the gator . Edna was frantic , but Amanda tried to remain calm . " I just kept telling Edna that I would n't leave her , and that we were going to be okay . " The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the girls reached shore . Edna spent a week in the hospital . Though she is recovering , the gator literally left his mark . Fracturing her left arm , the reptile tore a nearly eight-inch-long wound below her elbow . Edna 's right hand , which she used to pry open the alligator 's jaws , is striped with gashes . Since the terrifying incident , the girls have forged an even tighter bond . " While I was in the hospital , " Edna says , " I told Amanda how much I love her . If she had n't come back for me , I have no doubt that I would have died . I owe her everything , " she adds . " I owe her my life . " Even now , Amanda does n't see herself as a hero-she was just doing what came naturally : " I 'm just glad I was able to help , " she says simply . " I would never want to think about losing her . " - Carrie St. Michel // when the chips are down is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around you , but there is heroism in confronting prejudice or hatred or injustice or ignorance . " Part of heroism is being willing to have a voice and use that voice , " Noble says . The woman who calls a friend on a racist comment is using her voice ; so is the woman who stands up for a colleague who 's been unfairly treated or , like Karen Silkwood and Erin Brockovich , blows the whistle on corporate wrongdoing . " Most people are too cowardly to speak their minds when they see something is wrong , " Straw says . " It takes a special person to be able to withstand negative pressure from others . " For every angry , ignorant person who lashes out at a Sikh in a turban , there is someone like Maggie Gat , an Episcopal priest in Dover , New Jersey , who walked up and down the streets in her town with the leader of a local mosque . Other religious leaders in New Jersey have been organizing volunteers to go grocery shopping with Muslim women who are afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the astounding bravery of the Afghan women who , though silenced by their government , set up secret schools for their daughters . A recent article in The Newark Star-Ledger told how one of those pupils , a six-year-old girl , was caught with a school notebook by a member of the Taliban , who then beat her . Her mother decided to keep her out of the class , not only because she feared for the child 's safety but because she worried that her daughter would be followed , the school discovered , and other people hurt . If the opportunities we have to make our voices heard are less dramatic , that does n't mean they are less important . There 's a basic human desire to make our lives count , to make a difference in the world . Rabbi Harold S. Kushner , author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People , goes straight to the heart of this need in his new book , Living a Life that Matters . Rabbi Kushner believes there are three ways for each of us to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understand that it 's fine to be " the best actor in a supporting role : For example , you can drive your neighbor , who is experiencing the life-or-death drama of cancer , to her chemotherapy . " Second , he points out , a lot of good people acting in concert can make a big difference . " They can help create a community where compassion is valued , and there 's no malicious gossip . " Finally , Kushner advises , " We change the world by loving the people around us , and letting them love us . " In an America at war and on edge , the people who need us most are n't strangers in a collapsing building-they 're our families , our friends , our neighbors . In a recent sermon , the Reverend Bolles  --  Beaven put it this way , touching her hand to her heart : " Ground zero is always with us . It 's in here . " More than courage , this quiet heroism takes commitment . It rarely wins medals or the cheers of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extolled as heroic , " Noble says , " but they are critical attributes . " It takes place not in the adrenaline rush of disaster but in a slow perseverance , in the daily discipline of patience and kindness . It 's purposeful , not passive .
