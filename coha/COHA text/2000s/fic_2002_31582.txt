Judy Moody By Megan McDonald Candlewick Megan McDonald When Judy Moody arrived in third grade , her teacher , Mr. Todd , stood by the door , welcoming everyone . " Hello there , Judy . " " Hello , Mr. Toad , " said Judy . She cracked herself up . " Class , please hang your backpacks on the hooks and put your lunches in the cubbies , " said Mr. Todd . Judy Moody looked around the classroom . " Do you have a porcupine named Roger ? " Judy asked Mr. Todd . " No , but we have a turtle named Tucson . Do you like turtles ? " She liked turtles ! But she caught herself just in time . " No . I like toads . " Judy cracked up again . " Rocky , your seat is over by the window , and Judy , yours is right up front , " said Mr. Todd . " I knew it , " said Judy . She surveyed her new front-row desk . It did n't have an armadillo sticker with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle from her . Frank Eats-Paste Pearl . He glanced at Judy sideways , then bent his thumb all the way back , touching his wrist . Judy rolled her tongue like a hot dog back at him . " You like sharks too ? " he asked , passing her a small white envelope with her name on it . Ever since they had danced the Maypole together in kindergarten , this boy would not leave her alone . In first grade , Frank Pearl sent her five valentines . In second grade , he gave her a cupcake on Halloween , on Thanksgiving , and on Martin Luther King , Jr . Day . Now , on the first day of third grade , he gave her a birthday party invitation . Judychecked the date inside-his birthday was not for three weeks ! Even a real shark would not scare him off . " Can I look inside your desk ? " asked Judy . He moved to one side . No sign of paste . Mr. Todd stood in front of the class . GINO 'S EXTRA-CHEESE PIZZA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are we having extra-cheese pizza for lunch ? " Judy asked . " For Spelling . " Mr. Todd held his finger to his lips like it was a secret . " You 'll see . " Then he said , " Okay ! Third grade ! Listen up ! We 're going to try something different to kick off the year , as a way of getting to know one another . This year , each of you will make your own Me collage . All about YOU . You can draw or cut out pictures and paste things to your collage that tell the class what makes you YOU . " A Me collage ! It sounded fun to Judy , but she did n't say so . " We do n't have to draw a map of our family , then ? " asked Jessica Finch . " I 'm passing out a list of ideas for things you might include , like your family . I 'm also giving everyone a folder for collecting the things you want to put on your collage . We 'll work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of September , you 'll each get a chance to tell the class about YOU . " All through Language Arts and Social Studies , Judy thought about one thing-herself . Judy Moody , star of her own Me collage . Maybe third grade was n't so bad after all . " Okay , everybody . Time for Spelling . " " Yuck . Spelling , " Judy said under her breath , remembering her bad mood . " Yuck . Spelling , " Frank Pearl agreed . Judy squinched her eyebrows at him . " Take out a piece of paper and write down five spelling words you can find hidden in the words on the board , GINO 'S EXTRA-CHEESE PIZZA . " " Cool Spelling , huh ? " said a note passed to Judy by Frank . " No , " she wrote back on her hand , flashing it at him . Judy took out her brand-new package of Grouchy pencils with mad faces on them . GROUCHY pencils-for completely impossible moods , said the package . Ever see a pencil that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed ? Perfect . The new Grouchy pencil helped her think . She found the words TREE , TEXAS , and TAXI hidden in Mr. Todd 's spelling on the board . But instead she wrote down 1 ) NO 2 ) NO 3 ) NO 4 ) NO 5 ) NO . " Who would like to tell the class five words they came up with ? " asked Mr. Todd . Judy 's hand shot up . " Judy ? " " NO , NO , NO , NO , NO ! " said Judy . " That 's one word . I need four more . Come up and write them on the board . " Judy Moody did not write TREE , TEXAS , and TAXI . Instead she wrote RAT and GNAT . " How about BRAT ? " called Rocky . " There 's no B , " said Frank Pearl . TIGER , wrote Judy . " One more word , " said Mr. Todd . SPIT , wrote Judy . " Can you use any of those words in a sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spit on the rat and the gnat . " The whole class cracked up . Frank laughed so hard he snorted . " Are you in a bad mood today ? " asked Mr. Todd . " ROAR , " said Judy Moody . " That 's too bad , " said Mr. Todd . " I was just about to ask who wants to go down to the office and pick up the pizza . It 's a welcome-back surprise . " " Pizza ? Pizza ! For real ? " The room buzzed with excitement . Judy Moody wanted to be the one to pick up the pizza . She wanted to be the one to open the box . She wanted to be the one who got to keep the little three-legged plastic table that kept the box top from sticking to the pizza . " So . Who would like to pick up the pizza today ? " asked Mr. Todd . " Me ! " yelled Judy . " Me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! " everyone shouted at once , waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand without saying a word . " Rocky , would you like to pick up the pizza ? " " Sure ! " said Rocky . " Luck-y ! " Judy said . Continues ... by Megan McDonald
