MEMOIR Headnote On not sleeping with Marlon Brando // Marlon Brando in a brown velvet jacket with a black broadtail collar has his arm draped casually over Rita Hayworth 's shoulders , but his knuckles-light as a firefly 's wings-are tracing the upper flank of my left arm . No one else seated in the semicircular leather banquette floating midfloor at Matteo 's Italian restaurant in Westwood can see those knuckles-not Rita Hayworth , who appears to have difficulty seeing anything ; not Bob , my young turk of a husband , who is seated at the opposite end of the banquette from Brando in a poor viewing position ; not even the dapper Hollywood agent on my right , who was having dinner alone with Rita Hayworth until Bob and I , unwilling to wait thirty or forty minutes for a table , joined them . Of all of us , that agent might be the most amused at knowing the whereabouts of Marlon Brando 's knuckles : " Phyllis , " he said , when Brando materialized above us and lowered himself into our booth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Although no one at our table knows that Marlon Brando is sending me a signal with his knuckles , his touch is heating up my skin like a sun reflector in the California desert . Heat is traveling up my arm , through my body , and into my head . I am being careful not to move , even when I breathe . Neither Brando nor I make any visible sign of what is transpiring between us . Since I became aware of his touch I have n't altered my expression , and Brando , even when looking directly at me , appears oblivious . His face , at once both tender and cruel , is not what it was over twenty years ago when I watched alongside my mother as he bulked across the stage as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire , or even seven years later when he played the tragic small  --  time punk Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront . But now , in 1968 , his body thicker but not yet shrouded in fat , he is still mesmerizing to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of his charm on Rita Hayworth while beckoning me to him with his knuckles . He 's looking directly at her with a gaze of such pitying commiseration , such concern , that it 's difficult for me to watch them without feeling as if I 'm seeing something I should n't . She in no way resembles the Rita Hayworth of memory , the beloved of the bad-boy genius Orson Welles and of the playboy Prince Aly Khan ; no trace of the glamorous actress who looked out from the covers of the fan magazines I read in high school under the hair dryer in my Brooklyn beauty parlor . Her face is puffy , her hair is pulled back in a severe bun , and she 's dressed in a strict , buttoned-up glen-plaid suit and laced-up oxfords . She does n't look so much like a movie star as like a woman who , if she even had a film career , would have spent it playing the matron in British orphanages . But Brando is treating her as if she 's still the luscious Gilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , strapless black gown . Photograph // He 'd crooned her name , looming above our table while the diners in the surrounding booths shifted to watch them . He told her how thrilled he was to see her again , how happy he 'd been when he 'd spotted her from across the room . His voice was whiny with a hint of brass . He took her hand , which she unfurled from a glass of scotch , and held it safely between the two of his like a small white bird . They went back some years together , he explained to us . They were old , old friends . She 'd been there for him , saved him from himself , and they 'd had some great times together . She shook her head and smiled like a woman who has just gotten a prize but is n't sure for what . Behind the surface recognition her eyes looked vacant , and I wondered if she knew who he was . He slipped into our booth and began talking softly to her-betraying nothing , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquering march upon my skin and while Bob , the agent , and I conducted a parallel conversation , superficial and labored , about realestate prices in the San Fernando Valley , how Angie Dickinson reshaped her body , Japanese gardeners we had known . The restaurant was crowded that evening when Bob and I drove in from Pacific Palisades for dinner . We took one look at the packed bar and the crowd waiting for tables lined behind a velvet rope and did a quick turnaround . We thought we 'd go to a natural-foods place we liked in Topanga Canyon , or maybe to one of the fish joints on the Pacific Coast Highway . But when I returned from the ladies ' room , Bob pulled me to him and said , half laughing , " Brando 's here . You 'd never forgive me if we left . " That 's when we spotted the talent agent . We both knew him . We had met him at a party thrown by a New York actor friend of mine who had come to L.A. to shoot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill and becomes " Mr. Terrific . " We waved and he beckoned us over . " Is your name really Rita Hayworth ? " I asked as I slid into the booth alongside her , thinking her an impostor who had borrowed the name . " No , " she said in a rhythmic Spanish lilt , " it 's Margarita Carmen Cansino ! " Which in fact , although not the answer I expected , it was . Our booth was in the center of the floor and had a high back . Unless I climbed on my knees and peered over the top I had no way to see Brando . I went to the ladies ' room again , this time from inside the restaurant out to the bar , passing in front of his table , looking but not looking as if I was looking , seeing but not acting as if I had seen . Another man sat across from him . There were espresso cups , glasses , crumpled napkins . I was wearing a clingy blue minidress , and I made it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had inside information , as if I were a person who never turned back , always moved straight ahead . The walk had paid off . Now here he was . What was I going to do about it ? There are those individuals , I 'd learned by then from literature and from life , who pluck such a moment and others who let it sail by . I had always been in the sailing-by school myself , and this time my inclinations were in that direction . I had sent Brando a message , but the invitation was meaningless . I wanted attention but had no plan to follow through . I was not yet a person who took responsibility for her actions , did not believe that the laws of cause and effect had anything to do with me . When it came to flirtation there was no honor in me . I had married Bob while I was in college and he was in law school , and we had three children under the age of seven . Bob and I had our differences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of the more clandestine variety , and it would n't be with Marlon Brando . He was n't real . I knew that and so did Bob . That 's why we stayed ; to see the unreal made real . Seeing Marlon Brando at Matteo 's was like spotting JFK buying ties on Fifty-seventh Street or Marilyn Monroe in temple with Arthur Miller on Yom Kippur . You want to see them , but you do n't want anything more . One snowy night in New York , after a meat and a bottle of wine , Bob and I had passed The Carlyle hotel when JFK was in town . " Is he here ? " I 'd asked the doorman , a little loopy . " Are you good ? " he asked . Over my head he 'd winked at Bob . " You can go upstairs if you 're good . " My face had heated up . I felt it bum in the cold air . Although I 'd joked about the invitation all the way up Madison Avenue to our parking space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me uneasy . No , I did n't want to go upstairs or home with celebrities , or bring them home with me , physically or emotionally , not even the short distance down Santa Monica Boulevard to the mansion on the Palisades where in one intersection of fantasy with reality  --  as befits a young turk and his wife-we were living . His due a due with Hayworth concluded , Brando gathered up the rest of us and launched a paean to her : what a sensitive actress she was , how much she 'd taught him , the Stanislavsky side of her , the degree to which her insights had shaped his performances . Hayworth leaned back , nesting under his shoulder , suddenly younger , even glowing . He 'd moved her into the spotlight and she was enjoying it . Waiters and patrons craned their necks . She laughed and shook her head . From time to time she demurred , " No . Not really ! " But Brando hushed her . This was his game . We murmured appreciatively , but none of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understood that this was a courtship dance . I knew what he was doing and where he was headed as he extolled Hayworth , her beauty , her talent , her intuition . They 'd spent time together , he implied . A distant past floated over the table , impossible to nab , a location where their paths had crossed . No one-no one-was more fun than Rita . They 'd shared plenty of laughs , but there was more . He wanted us to know . In a business like theirs , a hotbed of lunatics with massive egos , a magnet for crazy people , lustful and betraying , she was a rare lady . A pure soul ! A class act ! He kissed his fingers in tribute . His eyes pressed mine . I nodded to let him know I understood . And I did , including the subtext . The louder he praised her , the better he got . Rita Hayworth was the star of this story , but Brando was the hero . Like all stories men tell about women , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A braver woman than I-and I knew some existed-would do something other than simply sit there . Bob had told me about the young New York actress who had packed her bags and flown out to L.A. after one night with an actor . The guy , a short , sweet-faced character actor , was working on the film Bob was producing , and he told Bob how she 'd just rung his doorbell and moved in . I 'd seen them together at a screening . His face gauzy with love , he 'd introduced her , a thin , shiny , midwestern blonde , stylishly without lipstick , and said-looking foolish ( though I may not have thought so then ) - that she 'd changed his life . Women did such things , I knew , and I began to wonder if I should n't do the same . I saw myself breaking into Brando 's tribute to Hayworth and pulling him out of the booth . I imagined he was just waiting for me to do it , to drag him with me across the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fried eggplant , past booths of men in body shirts and Gucci loafers and women with hair sprayed into bouffant towers . Just thinking about it my heart began to beat rapidly . I could see all of it ; the unsettling whiteness of Rita Hayworth 's powdered skin as I yanked Brando from her , the agent 's knowing smirk , the crimson tinge of rage that would erupt and color Bob 's pale , freckled face . I could see myself with Brando outside in Matteo 's parking lot , him leaning against a yellow Karmann-Ghia , doubled over with laughter , shaking his head , my cheek against the rich velvet jacket . I could hear him saying , " Oh Phyllis , you got it , honey . You did just right ! " Brando 's voice , soft and metallic , began to wind down . Even the century 's greatest actor could take this riff only so far . The thought entered my mind that he was preparing to leave us . I had n't considered this possibility , and it pained me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and would stay for a while . The pressure on my arm subtly decreased . He 'd finished . Now what ? " I 'm an actress , " I said . " I did the lead in a play at the Mark Taper . " The words coming out of my mouth surprised me . Until that moment I 'd had no plan to speak . Brando 's eyebrows rose just enough to let me know that there was nothing he would like less than to hear about my starring role in a downtown L.A. showcase . This was not a man built for listening . " I played Kitty Genovese , " I told him . Like my walk across the floor of Matteo 's , I was about to go someplace I had no map for , no way of knowing where I would end up . " I was killed in Queens , " I said . " I lay in an alley while all the witnesses who watched my murder from their windows explained why they did n't lift a finger to save me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel my autobiography surging up to meet his impassive face . " I was the star , but all I had to do was lie dead on the stage , " I said . " They marched around my body during the whole second act-all of them telling why they had n't come down to stop the killer . The afternoon of the final dress rehearsal there was a small earthquake . The stage trembled ; I could feel it moving beneath my cheek . The audience began rustling programs and moving around . A few headed up the aisles for the exits . But these actors all had monologues . There were casting agents there . Careers could be made . " I was dead-forty minutes of death-I could n't get up unless the stage manager brought down the curtain , and this was theater-in-the-round . There was no curtain . Finally , at the end of the act , I stand up . Then Winston Moseley , the killer , stalks me . The stage goes dark . The audience sees only my silhouette . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the table in Matteo 's , looking into my salad . " Backstage  --  when it was over-not one of those actors admitted there had been a tremor . Earthquake ? What earthquake ? ' An agent who saw the show liked the way I lay dead on the stage and liked my silhouette , the way I was stalked . He called me afterward , and I went to see him . The meeting was the shortest in history . He said I looked much younger onstage than off , so he did n't think I 'd be right for film ! " At that , Brando 's expressionless face slipped into laughter . He threw his head back and really laughed . I felt his touch change , his knuckles bolder and more insistent , moving in rhythm with his laughter , beating a rat-a-tat on my skin . I kept going . I told him how I played Eurydice , the tragic queen of Thebes , in Antigone at the Judson Theater in a Japanese Kabuki outfit , all of us white-faced , in masks . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup no one could tell . I told him how Warren Finnerty played Creon , drunk and high , late for every performance , how we struggled every night to get Finnerty made up , into his Kabuki costume and onto the stage . We never knew what he would say ; he made the lines up as he went . The director wore granny glasses and spoke in a whisper . The worse Finnerty got , the lower the director 's voice sank . The Kabuki concept was his idea , his artistic baby . He 'd been planning this production for years . Miraculously , the show was a triumph . A friend in the audience said , " You 've made theatrical history , adding improvisation to Kabuki and Greek drama . " Geraldine Page and Rip Torn came twice . By closing night the director 's voice was audible . I heard he went on to direct another Kabuki Antigone with a new ( and presumably sober ) cast . I told Brando how I danced in a black slip to " That Old Black Magic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience and leapt to the stage at Cafe La Mama ; how I auditioned for Valerie Solanas at a sleazy rehearsal hall in the East Village . ( She would go on to shoot Andy Warhol . ) I told him how another actor and I adapted a scene from a Philip Roth novel and got Philip Roth to come watch us perform it . When it was over Roth said , " Thank you , " and left . I told him how I improvised four nights a week for a year for no pay in a club on West Ninth Street , " a toilet on Lower Death Street . " When I 'd gone through nearly everything , the odyssey of my entire career-from my early acting classes with Uta Hagen right up through the Maxwell House Coffee commercial I auditioned for but did n't get because my hands shook so badly I nearly dropped the cup-I stopped . The table was silent . No one had spoken for all the time I 'd been talking , and I had no idea how long that had been-it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been skimming along like an ice-skater , pirouetting , doing figure eights . I loved being an actress , bad as I was , and I suppose I wanted to let Brando know that I knew something about what he knew , that I 'd put in my time in basements and churches and dark bars where actors imitated and idolized him . Brando was sitting back in the booth , an indulgent , paternal , amused look on his face-Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls , betting he can make it with Sarah , the Salvation Army captain , played by Jean Simmons in a prim uniform . His arm still encircled Hayworth . I had the thought that he was probably laughing at me , that whatever set me off on my monologue had been ill advised . Several months earlier Bob had brought Lee Marvin back to our house . He 'd stretched out on the grass . While I poured him a drink he warned me sternly never to talk about acting . " Talk is for amateurs ! " he said . " An actor without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that Uta Hagen once told our class that upon meeting those she idolized-like the Lunts-she was stunned to silence . She thought Brando was a genius . If she ever met him she doubted she 'd be able to speak . I should have listened . I consulted the rest of the table . Rita Hayworth oozed contentment . She had n't been listening to me . She gazed around the banquette like a bright bird and smiled as I imagined the Hayworth of old might have while sailing on Aly Khan 's yacht sipping scotch . Bob had heard all these stories before and in any event took a dim view of my acting career ; he now wore an expression I knew well-the smile of a man thanking his hostess for a dinner party that he had n't wanted to go to and was now in a rush to leave . Only the agent actually looked happy . Of all three bystanders to this scene , he seemed to have enjoyed it the most . A waiter appeared with plates on his arm , steam rising from veal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something red was put in front of me , something swimming in tomatoes . Brando mumbled fuzzily that he had to go , he 'd kept the friend at his table waiting too long . I felt his knuckles lift off my arm , the skin naked and weeping . He whispered something in Hayworth 's ear and she laughed . " See you , Mar , " the agent said . Bob flapped a couple of fingers . From above the table Brando looked down . " Phyllis , " he said in his soft , buttery whine . " I live on Mulholland . Up at the top , honey . You ca n't miss it . Why do n't you come over later ? I 'm always up late . " He added a line of numbers to his address . I felt them dance up and down in my brain . My mouth went very dry and the rims of my ears burned with heat . But I smiled as if nothing had happened . And he walked off without seeming to notice . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared of his espresso cup and wine glass , his crumpled napkin and his bread crumbs . A blonde model or dancer with skin as white as Wonder Bread sat in his place across from a man with a receding hairline who looked vaguely Chinese . We drove back to Pacific Palisades , Bob teasing . " Do n't you want to go ? " he asked . " You 're leaving the poor guy alone and rejected . " " Oh please , " I said . " He has about four thousand numbers to call and all his old movies to watch . " " Do n't be so sure , " Bob said . " I think he expects you . " Bob was behind the wheel of the little two-seater sports car he had bought for me that was supposed to make California driving , which I hated , more fun . We drove with the top down out Santa Monica Boulevard to our house . After Bob and I divorced I would discover a car just like that one in a movie starring Audrey Hepburn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the girl he fell in love with and married and the trips they took across France when they were young and carefree , before he was successful and she was unfaithful . There was a breeze from the Pacific hitting the open car and blowing over me , and I found myself secretly covering the spot on my arm where Brando had touched me , as if I could save what was left of him from blowing away .
