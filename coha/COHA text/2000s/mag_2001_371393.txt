Here 's my first problem : I ca n't stop watching the news . I watch it openly in my office all day . I watch it surreptitiously at home , as if it were porn that my young children must not see . I take every newspaper and magazine I can carry , and I read them on the train . My theory is this : the more information I have , the more I will feel as if I 'm in control . If I can assess the risk of anthrax attacks and suitcase nukes and the Russian 201st Motorized Rifle Division amassing in Tajikistan , maybe I wo n't have to worry about where bin Laden is going to strike next . <P> And this brings me to my second problem : I ca n't get enough information . With the new , Webby TV format  --  the talking head in one corner , the foreign correspondent in the other and the zippered news headlines at the bottom  --  in three minutes I 'm all caught up . Where can I find more ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fine for selected topics like the Taliban and hemorrhagic diseases . But for that mother lode of breaking news , deep background and raw gossip , Middle Eastern hands tell me , there is a short list of must-visit sites . <P> Start with the think tank Strategic Forecasting
