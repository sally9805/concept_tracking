The dousing of the Southern California wildfires has hardly ended the risk to U.S. forests . Years of drought and insect epidemics have also left millions of dead and dying trees across the Southeast . An infestation of the southern pine beetle that began in 1999 has killed a million acres of pine trees from Virginia to Alabama . Those dead trees  --  most either still standing or cut down and left to decay  --  are a potential tinderbox . A wetter , more humid climate makes a California-size conflagration unlikely . Still , there are dangers . <P>  --  By Elisabeth Kauffman
