Judith McMonigle Flynn gnashed her teeth , slammed the front door so hard that the screen rattled , and decided to call the police . She had gotten as far as the kitchen when her husband , Joe , sauntered in from the pantry . " What 's wrong ? " he inquired , noting his wife 's grim look . " Rudi , " Judith snapped . " Rudi and his violin . I ca n't stand it another minute . And neither can the B &B; guests . I 'd like to strangle your first wife for renting her house to that awful man . " " Come on , " Joe said , trying to sound reasonable . " You were elated when Vivian decided to stay year-round in Florida . Face it , you 've never really liked having her live so close to us in the cul-de-sac . " Judith admitted that was true . The situation had always been awkward , though in fairness , Vivian Flynn had n't turned out to be as big a pain as Judith had feared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Judith had nicknamed her  --  spent at least half of the year in a condo on Florida 's Gulf coast . When she was in residence on Heraldsgate Hill , Vivian was usually too busy drinking her way through the day to pester her ex-husband and his second wife . Herself was a creature of the night , and whatever she did after hours seldomdisturbed Judith and Joe or the guests at Hillside Manor B &B.; But Rudolf Wittener had brought a new element into the cozy cul-de-sac of agreeable neighbors . " I 'm talking about her choice of a tenant , " Judith declared . " You know many of our guests complain about Rudi practicing his damned violin or playing his own recordings at all hours . The last straw was during that hot spell in August when he rehearsed outside  --  in the nude . That poor woman from Vermont fainted . " " No wonder , " Joe remarked , his green eyes mischievous . " She 'd probably never seen her husband in the nude . I might faint if I saw that guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped him here from Vermont in a mailing tube . " Judith tried not to smile . " I 'm serious . Talking to Rudi did n't do any good . We both tried that . He knows you 're a retired policeman  --  that does n't bother him . Some of the other neighbors have complained , too , including Carl and Arlene Rankers . I even spoke to his wife or girlfriend or whatever she is . Zip . He just keeps sawing away . " " I thought the girl was his daughter , " Joe said , taking a ginger-snap out of the sheep-shaped cookie jar on the kitchen table . Judith shook her head . " Definitely not . At least she does n't call him ' Daddy . ' She uses his first name . Hers is Taryn , I think . She gives music lessons in the basement , but luckily you ca n't hear that . " Joe poured himself a mug of coffee . " If it 's true that he 's taken on a job as assistant concertmaster with the symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have their big gala about a week ago ? He 'll be playing or at rehearsals most of the time . Besides , we 're into fall . The weather 's changing . Doors and windows will be closed . I 'll bet you fifty bucks we wo n't be hearing much of Rudi for a while . " " You 'd better be right , " Judith said . " I 'd bet a lot more than fifty that we 've lost several potential return visitors in the two and a half months since Rudi moved in . " Munching on the gingersnap , Joe shrugged . " You 've got to admit , he plays well . " Judith shot Joe a dirty look . " Yes . But even if he does n't actually practice more than an hour or so a day , he plays those tapes or whatever over and over again , and they 're way too loud . I 'd like to kill him . " The gold flecks that had danced in Joe 's eyes  --  magic eyes , Judith called them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Judith grimaced . " No . No , I should n't . " " You do have a history when it comes to dead people , " he said , and though he tried to keep his voice light , his expression was somber . " I know . " Judith put a hand on his arm . " I swear to you , I do n't want history ever repeating itself . " Joe tried not to look dubious . I 'm calling from our new slum , " said the muted voice at the other end of the line . Judith frowned . It sounded like Cousin Renie , but the words did n't quite fit . " Yes ? " Judith replied in a noncommittal tone . " Bill and I have to sell the house . " It was definitely Renie . " What ? " Judith practically shouted . Renie sighed loudly . " How else can I pay off those bills from the San Francisco trip ? When Cruz Cruises went belly-up after the homicide investigation last March , I not only lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my  --  our  --  expenses . " Judith thought back to the long  --  very long  --  weekend she had spent with Renie in San Francisco . They were supposed to go on a cruise to the Cook Islands , but on the night of their departure , murder had intervened . The trip was eventually canceled  --  and so was the cruise line , which had more problems than a dead owner . " Surely , " Judith said wryly , " you 're not including all those clothes and shoe bills you ran up at Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus . I assume they were n't business expenses . " " Well . . . " Renie paused . " They are . I 've tried to deduct my clothes from our income tax , but the IRS is so unreasonable . Do n't they realize that I ca n't meet clients in the old crap I wear around the house ? " That , Judith had to admit , was true . Renie 's at-home wardrobe consisted of ratty T-shirts , baggy sweatshirts , and tattered pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted  --  like a bum . " You spent a grand on shoes alone at Neiman Marcus , " Judith pointed out . " And I know you must have shelled out five times that much at Saks . You even bought me clothes  --  which I 've finally paid you back for . " " Yes , yes , " Renie said impatiently , " but there are other considerations . Like food and clothing and The Children .
