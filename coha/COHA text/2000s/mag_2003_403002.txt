// " It 's no use , Maman , " said Johnny on Saturday afternoon . " I 'm just no good at dancing . " His mother made a clucking sound . " Cher , " she said , " I showed you over and over . You got to keep trying . " " But- " " Tonight will be different , you 'll see . Try a turn with that pretty Lisette Theriot . I 've known her mama since the second grade . " Johnny sighed and went outside , banging the screen door behind him . Under his arm was the old black Monarch accordion his grandfather had given him . He threw himself down under the mimosa tree and pulled open the bellows . He loved to play the old Cajun songs he had heard all his life . His fingers moved nimbly over the little silver buttons . Before long , he had forgotten all his problems . Every Saturday night since he could remember , he and his parents had gone to the dance at the Chinaball Club in Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Monsieur Alcide Mouton , played the accordion and the guitar with his band , the Sundown Ramblers . It used to be the best night of the week , but lately everything had changed . Now that Johnny was older , he was expected to ask a girl to dance at least once a night . He could dance all right when he practiced by himself at home . But as soon as he had to dance in public , he got confused and flustered and made a fool of himself every time . As the sun began to set , Maman called him in to wash up . He pressed the air out of the accordion in a loud sigh and snapped the leather strap shut . The Chinaball Club was already rever-berating with music when Johnny and his parents arrived in their old green pickup . Maman straightened his collar and said , " Now do n't forget to dance with Lisette Theriot . " " Oui , Maman , " said Johnny . He followed them inside , his newly shined shoes pinching his toes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance was too much on his mind . At last he summoned the courage to approach Lisette. // She was standing with a group of girls , sipping lemonade . Her shirt was blue with big red flowers , and she wore a big red bow in her dark brown hair . The girls nudged each other as Johnny approached . His cheeks burned . He stopped in front of Lisette and stammered , " May I have this dance ? " The other girls giggled . One of them pushed Lisette from behind just as Johnny offered her his hand , and the lemonade sloshed on her shirt . " I 'm sorry , " said Johnny , flushing a deeper shade of red . He pulled his hand-kerchief from his back pocket and dabbed at the stain . " That 's all right , Johnny , " said Lisette with a little smile . " I 'll dance with you . " She led the way to the dance floor and waited a moment for him to begin the waltz . Johnny counted silently to three , missed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisette gave up and took the lead . This threw him off , and he was lost . The other couples glided by them in a large , graceful circle . Johnny struggled to keep up with Lisette 's smooth steps , but he was always one beat behind her . He stumbled and trod on her toes . A group of boys had joined the girls to watch . Johnny could hear snickers and guffaws . Then he heard Pierre Landry , the captain of the football team , say , " Look at that-I swear Johnny Broussard has two left feet ! " Peals of laughter stung his ears . That did it . Johnny broke away and ran outside , leaving Lisette standing in the middle of the dance floor . He spent the rest of the evening waiting for his parents in the pickup truck . Johnny vowed never to go to another dance , no matter what his mother said . He would miss hearing the Sundown Ramblers , but at least he would n't be humiliated again . The next Saturday he stayed away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the turtles on the bank of the creek . Late in the afternoon , Johnny saw a blue car pull up to the house in a cloud of dust . A man dressed in neat khakis and a black hat emerged from the driver 's seat . Johnny went closer . It looked like . . . it was ! Monsieur Alcide Mouton himself ! Papa came out of the barn to meet him . " What brings you out our way , Alcide ? " " I 'm craving some of your prize sweet potatoes , " said Monsieur Alcide . " Will you sell me a crate of them ? " Papa nodded . " I 'll go fetch you one , " he said . " You know my boy , Johnny ? " " Why , sure . Comment ca va , Johnny ? What you got there ? " Johnny timidly shook the outstretched hand and then held up his accordion . Monsieur Alcide whistled . " An old Monarch , eh ? That 's a nice accordion , son . You play ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no , I. . . " " Come on , what 's your favorite song ? " " ' The Bosco Stomp . ' ' " " Well then , let me hear that . " Johnny sat down on a stump , stretched out the bellows and began to play . Monsieur Alcide 's eyes widened , and when the song was over , he let out a whistle . " How 'd you learn to play like that , boy ? " // " Monsieur , I been listening to you since I was a bebe ! " Monsieur Alcide nodded . " You been listening good , too . Hold on , I got my guitar in the car . Let 's play a few tunes together , want to ? " " Sure ! " They sat on the porch steps and played all the songs Johnny knew . He even got up the courage to sing a little . The sun was setting when Monsieur Alcide stood up . " I got to be going if I 'm gon na get to the Chinaball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny ducked his head . " I-I 'm not sure . " " Well , sure you are . Bring that accordion with you , and you can play some songs on stage with the Ramblers . " Monsieur Alcide paid Papa for the sweet potatoes and drove off , leaving Johnny staring open-mouthed after him . Papa clasped Johnny 's shoulder as they went inside to get ready . At the Chinaball Club , Johnny scanned the crowd for Lisette and her friends . He spotted them and skirted the room in the opposite direction . He sat down with his parents , hiding his accordion under the table . // It was n't long before Pierre Landry walked by and said , " Hey , Leftie ! " The other boys all laughed , and Johnny sank lower in his chair . The Sundown Ramblers played for a long time before Johnny finally heard Monsieur Alcide call his name . He picked up his accordion and went to the bandstand , his eyes on the floor . " Mes amis , I got a surprise for you tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny Broussard is going to join us for a few numbers on his accordion . He sings , too . Johnny , let 's do The Bosco Stomp . ' ' " Trembling , Johnny stepped up on the platform . He could hear a smattering of applause as Monsieur Alcide lowered the microphone for him . He began to play , and the drummer , guitar , and fiddle players joined in behind him . He sang all the verses he knew . When the song ended , he heard cheers and whoops of approval . Lisette was smiling up at him from the dance floor . " Play " Jolie Blonde ' ' ! " someone shouted , and Johnny did . " Do you know " The Evangeline Special ' ' ? " called someone else , and he played it . Johnny kept playing until the dance was over . As he snapped his accordion shut , Monsieur Alcide said , " You did a fine job tonight , son . You go home and practice all week , then come back and play with us again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a little money in it for you . " " Yes , sir ! " said Johnny . He hopped off the stage and joined his parents . As they went outside into the warm humid evening , Johnny saw Lisette and her friends in a little cluster near the door . They all stopped talking when they saw him . He stumbled on the stairs . // Lisette stepped forward , smiling . " You played real good tonight , Johnny , " she said . " Merci beaucoup , " Johnny blushed . " Will you be playing again next week ? " said Lisette . " I think so . " " Well , bon soir , " she said . " G'night , " said Johnny . As he walked on , no one laughed or called him " Leftie . " Pierre Landry even moved out of the way for him to pass . Johnny climbed into the truck and patted his accordion . Come to think of it , in his whole life , he had never once seen Monsieur Alcide Mouton out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
