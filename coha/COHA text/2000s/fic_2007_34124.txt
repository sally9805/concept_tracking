I stood in the shadows of a deserted shop front across from The Blood and Brew Pub , trying not to be obvious as I tugged my black leather pants back up where they belonged . This is pathetic , I thought , eyeing the rain-emptied street . I was way too good for this . Apprehending unlicensed and black-art witches was my usual line of work , as it takes a witch to catch a witch . But the streets were quieter than usual this week . Everyone who could make it was at the West Coast for our yearly convention , leaving me with this gem of a run . A simple snag and drag . It was just the luck of the Turn that had put me here in the dark and rain . " Who am I kidding ? " I whispered , pulling the strap of my bag farther up my shoulder . I had n't been sent to tag a witch in a month : unlicensed , white , dark , or otherwise . Bringing the mayor 's son in for Wereing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best idea . A sleek car turned the corner , looking black in the buzz of the mercury street lamp . This was its third time around the block . A grimace tightened my face as it approached , slowing . " Damn it , " I whispered . " I need a darker door front . " " He thinks you 're a hooker , Rachel , " my backup snickered into my ear . " I told you the red halter was slutty . " " Anyone ever tell you that you smell like a drunk bat , Jenks ? " I muttered , my lips barely moving . Backup was un-settlingly close tonight , having perched himself on my earring . Big dangling thing  --  the earring , not the pixy . I 'd found Jenks to be a pretentious snot with a bad attitude and a temper to match . But he knew what side of the garden his nectar came from . And apparently pixies were the best they 'd let me take out since the frog incident . I would have sworn fairies were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eased forward to the curb as the car squished to a wet-asphalt halt . There was the whine of an automatic window as the tinted glass dropped . I leaned down , smiling my prettiest as I flashed my work ID . Mr. One Eyebrow 's leer vanished and his face went ashen . The car lurched into motion with a tiny squeak of tires . " Day-tripper , " I said in disdain . No , I thought in a flash of chastisement . He was a norm , a human . Even if they were accurate , the terms daytripper , domestic , squish , off-the-rack , and my personal favorite , snack , were politically frowned upon . But if he was picking strays up off the sidewalk in the Hollows , one might call him dead . The car never slowed as it went through a red light , and I turned at the catcalls from the hookers I had displaced about sunset . They were n't happy , standing brazenly on the corner across from me . I gave them a little wave , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny , spellenhanced rear . The hooker and her distinctly husky-looking " friend " talked loudly as they tried to hide the cigarette they were passing between each other . It did n't smell like your usual tobacco . Not my problem , tonight , I thought , moving back into my shadow . I leaned against the cold stone of the building , my gaze lingering on the red taillights of the car as it braked . Brow furrowed , I glanced at myself . I was tall for a woman  --  about five-eight  --  but not nearly as leggy as the hooker in the next puddle of light over . I was n't wearing as much makeup as she was , either . Narrow hips and a chest that was almost flat did n't exactly make me streetwalker material . Before I found the leprechaun outlets , I had shopped in the " your first bra " aisle . It 's hard finding something without hearts and unicorns on it there . My ancestors had immigrated to the good old U.S. of A. in the 1800s . Somehow through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct red hair and green eyes of our Irish homeland . My freckles , though , are hidden under a spell my dad bought me for my thirteenth birthday . He had the tiny amulet put into a pinky ring . I never leave home without it . A sigh slipped from me as I tugged my bag back up onto my shoulder . The leather pants , red ankle boots , and the spaghetti strap halter were n't too far from what I usually wore on casual Fridays to tick off my boss , but put them on a street corner at night ... " Crap , " I muttered to Jenks . " I look like a hooker . " His only response was a snort . I forced myself not to react as I turned back to the bar . It was too rainy for the early crowd , and apart from my backup and the " ladies " down the way , the street was empty . I 'd been standing out here nearly an hour with no sign of my mark . I might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , I might look like a solicitee rather than a solicitor . Taking a resolute breath , I pulled a few strands of my shoulder-length curls from my topknot , took a moment to arrange it artfully to fall about my face , and finally spit out my gum . The click of my boots made a snappy counterpoint to the jangling of the handcuffs pinned to my hip as I strode across the wet street and into the bar . The steel rings looked like a tawdry prop , but they were real and very well-used . I winced . No wonder Mr. One Eyebrow had stopped . Used for work , thank you , and not the kind you 're thinking of . Still , I 'd been sent to the Hollows in the rain to collar a leprechaun for tax evasion . How much lower , I wondered , could I sink ?
