<p> His name is Dushan , and if you ask him what he smuggles , he will smile and tell you , " Whatever yields the highest profit . " Dushan , who would only give his first name , was 16 when he was expelled from school for bad behavior . He started dealing cannabis . At 19 , he bought his first speedboat and began smuggling guns , drugs , and people across the Adriatic , a business so profitable that it allowed him to support his nine siblings . It is the typical resume of a skafist , as Albanians call smugglers . On this morning , Dushan is driving along the coast from Vlore to Radhima , where many of the smugglers hide and repair their speedboats during the day . " My father is a poor blacksmith , " he says , " he can not support our family . " In Vlore , a city so poor that even manhole covers are stolen and resold , Dushan saw smuggling as the only career to provide him with a substantial income . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . By most measures , Albania is the poorest nation in Europe . One in 5 Albanians scrapes by on $ 20 a month . One in 7 has simply left the country . Out of the economic ruins left behind by Enver Hoxha , the Communist dictator who ruled Albania for four decades , organized crime has flourished . Initially , Durshan lined his pockets by smuggling cannabis , but when the market saturated and prices dropped , Dushan changed his strategy . He started smuggling people . He teamed up with another smuggler and together they bought a speedboat for $ 90,000 . In the beginning , night after night , Dushan steered the boat across the Adriatic . But then a close friend was killed during a collision with an Italian police boat . Another smuggler friend disappeared during a crossing from Vlore to Otranto , Italy . His boat was never found . Dushan says the incidents left him so shaken that he could n't steer his own boat anymore and had to hire a skipper . " I was 19 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Asked about the lives of those who board his speedboat every night , he only says , " It is much more dangerous for the skipper . As long as we had passengers on board , the Italians never tried to hit us . " There came a time , not long after that , when Dushan wanted to get out of the business . He yearned for a quiet life and wanted to get married . How does a young skafist find a woman to settle down with ? Durshan went to Macedonia and bought himself a young Moldovian woman for $ 5,000 . She was 19 , and he liked the way she looked . The two went to Bari , Italy , hoping to start all over again . He began learning Italian ; she started selling her body . It was supposed to be only for a while . But the girl started using cocaine , and it worried Dushan . It concerned him even more that she never made more than $ 125 a night . He took her back to Macedonia and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still looks like that of a boy , too young for the many turns his life has already taken . He has sparse facial hair , as if he has not yet shaved , and his voice is high-pitched like a child 's . The Marlboro Lights cigarette between his fingers seems like an awkward attempt to look manly in the company of men . And when he tells his story , it sounds more like someone else 's story , perhaps that of an elder brother ( which it is , in a way , as his brother is currently on trial in Italy for smuggling illegal immigrants ) . But Dushan says he knows what he is doing and claims that he is only offering a service . " I am not a criminal , " he insists , " this is just my way of living . " The real crooks , he says , are shooting each other in the streets of Vlore . Indeed , the Vlore smugglers are on edge , and not because of the police . At lunch time , they sit next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel Bologna , the toniest address in town . The smugglers , wearing gold-rimmed sunglasses and open white shirts revealing their chest hair , come for the pasta at the hotel restaurant . The police officers , stationed in Vlore to restore order , also like to watch the smugglers ' girlfriends . From the hotel terrace they have a beautiful view of the sea and the ostentatious villas the smugglers have built along the promenade , in colors matching the bikinis of their girlfriends . Not all of them , however , get to finish building their dream homes . The villa of a famous smuggler known as Tozo stands on the sea front like a monument to the short-lived business , half-built and deserted . Tozo was assassinated . And tension in the city has been palpable ever since a recent shooting in front of the club " Chateau . " Vlore 's boss of bosses lost his best man in the shooting and took a bullet himself . The man - known as Zani and worshiped by his cronies as " the sultan " - survived the assassination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later his brother 's body was found in the woods outside the city . He was executed in such gruesome fashion that even the people of Vlore , who have seen more than their share of cruelty , shuddered . According to the coroner 's report , the killers shot Zani 's brother 18 times in the chest . Then they put a rope around his neck , tied it to a car and dragged him through the forest . Then they mutilated his body . Now the city is bracing for Zani 's revenge . " It is frightening , " says Eric Filipink , who monitors the situation in Vlore for the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . " Criminals have become mythical figures in this town . And people admire them . They envy them for their golden necklaces , their cars , their drugs , their women . " The smugglers have created a shadow economy of businesses that depend on them : guest houses where their customers stay , cafes and bars where the smugglers arrange deals , skippers who navigate their speedboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They claim that all they do is take people to the country of their dreams , " says Filipink . " I say they are parasites who suck the blood out of desperate people . " Police estimate there are about 150 speedboats , worth up to $ 100,000 each , in and around Vlore . The fleet , they say , is one of the biggest private investments in Albania . Last January , the new Vlore police chief , vowing to crack down on immigrant smugglers , confiscated nine of the boats . In turn , the smugglers confiscated the police chief , held a gun to his head , and asked him if he would care to live a little longer . He nodded and returned the boats as soon as he was released . He left the city a few days later and has n't returned . Such is the spasmodic nature of the enforcement effort . In late July , after two Italian policemen died when their boat was rammed by an Albanian smuggler , the prime ministers of both countries met in Tirana to bolster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meta cited the 170 smugglers captured to date this year and promised to pass new legislation to tighten regulations on the boats used for smuggling . Italian Prime Minster Giuliano Amato noted that the number of refugees has dropped significantly from last year ( thanks largely to the end of a " bubble " of Kosovars fleeing Serb " ethnic cleansing " in 1998 ) . He vowed that Italy would continue its logistical support to the Albanians and to maintain the joint Albanian-Italian crews on its police boats . But Italian police say more needs to be done , and want to change the rules of engagement so they can fire on the smugglers . Often when immigrant smugglers from Eastern Europe talk about their countries , they mourn the loss of law and order upheld by the iron-fisted rulers of the past . Dushan says he still admires Enver Hoxha . The Communist dictator died in 1985 , but during his rule he kept Albania in virtual solitary confinement . Dushan still remembers the heroic songs they had to sing back then . " We were even poorer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was order . No crime , no prostitution , no drugs . " A case in point , Dushan says , is the day he was arrested for drug dealing by the security police of Mr. Hoxha 's successor , Sali Berisha . The agents beat him badly , and that was expected . But what happened next , he says , would have been unimaginable under Hoxha . " We bribed the judge , and he let me go . " Dushan slows down the car and turns into a narrow gravel road . Passing rows of cedars and orange groves , he drives halfway up a hill . He has bought a piece of land here , with a beautiful view of the turquoise sea . He says he would like to build a hotel here someday , when tourists will dare to travel to Albania . As the car reaches the end of the road , it becomes obvious that a flock of particularly reclusive guests is already staying here . A fleet of speedboats , eight altogether , is parked on trailers behind the cedars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albanian sun , are bent over the boats , repairing damaged hulls , servicing engines . A Kalashnikov rifle leans against a trailer tire . The sun has begun to set , and the skafisti , sleep-deprived , are yawning . Their bodies have adapted to the rhythm of the smuggler 's life ; they are creatures of the night . A tall , red-haired man with a protruding belly and a cigarette dangling from his lips slouches toward Dushan . They kiss each other on both cheeks and then take a walk between the boats , touching hulls and engines along the way . They are talking about Kokthi , the smuggler killed in a collision with a police boat . " We 'll make them bleed for it , " says the red-haired giant , referring to the Italian police . Kokthi 's death must be avenged , he says and suggests sending poisoned heroin to Italy . He tells Dushan that a comrade of Kokthi 's was badly injured during the collision and is said to be in critical condition in an Italian hospital . For a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He pulls on his cigarette . He will go out on the sea again tonight . Getting killed is part of the game , he says , but so far it has always been somebody else 's turn to lose . He shrugs . Then he drops the cigarette in the dust and extinguishes it with his bare foot . " The sea gives , " he says , " and the sea takes . " The next day in Vlore , the city seems frozen in prayer , staring in silence as a black hearse slowly rolls through the dusty streets . Behind the windows , in a sea of fresh flowers , Kokthi is lying in his open coffin . A motorcade of various Mercedes models and several buses filled with mourners follows the hearse . People on the sidewalks crane their necks , trying to catch a glimpse of the dead . As the motorcade approaches the outskirts of the city , it moves up a steep hill toward the cemetery . The hearse passes through the gate of the cemetery and comes to a halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunglasses lift the coffin , now closed , and rest it on their shoulders . As they carry Kokthi to his grave , they pass a row of 89 tombstones decorated with white flowers . They are the graves of refugees who drowned two years ago when their overloaded ship capsized off the Italian coast . In death , Kokthi the ferryman returns to the victims of his trade . The skafisti have brought a wreath for their fallen comrade . " Shokut te paharuar " reads the words on the red ribbon , " for our unforgettable friend . " Kokthi 's mother , kneeling before the coffin , is holding on to it , not wanting to let go . Then the coffin is lowered into the earth . Fresh flowers rain onto it . The skafisti put on their sunglasses and return to their cars . One by one they speed back to the city . Down by the sea , tonight 's passengers are waiting .
