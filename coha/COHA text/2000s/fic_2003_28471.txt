Chapter One The beast had devoured her world . At five years old she 'd looked into its face and had barely escaped from its jaws . Now she was twenty-six - okay , twenty-seven in a couple of weeks , Tamara King thought grimly . She was still battling the beast . She was a firefighter . She hated fire . " Anybody in there ? " She saw Joey Silva spare her a glance from a few yards down the corridor , but already she was kicking the door open . She entered , moving quickly through the tiny rooms before racing back into the corridor . " These freakin ' rooming houses . " Under his helmet , her partner 's expression was disgruntled . " Freakin ' fire-traps . Come on , I found another freakin ' hallway . " " Gosh darn it all anyway . " Tamara looked at the stairway behind them . " You know , Joey , you 're going to have to get a couple new cuss words one of these days . " He followed her glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go rouse the rest of the rubbies and the junkies . " She fell into step behind him , not taken in by his seeming callousness . It and his profanity were part of the protective shell that all of them had to grow , in their own individual ways . The yellow bands on Joey 's coat were bobbing smears of color in the smoke , and she reached with her leather- gloved handfor the air-pack at her chest . Following him into the secondary corridor Tamara realized that although a few tendrils of smoke were eddying in from the hallway they 'd just left , this one was clear . Bad sign , she thought , instantly alert . It 's trying to trick us . " The bitch is around here somewhere . " Joey 's gaze had narrowed in identical suspicion , and despite the situation she hid a smile as she scanned the hallway . She called it the beast . For reasons known only to himself , he saw fire as a heartless female who - Her thoughts screeched to a halt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was a tracery of glowing red . " Hell , Joey - it 's in the ceiling , " she whispered hoarsely . " And the freakin ' ceiling could go any minute . " He wiped his mouth . " Come on , Red , the faster we check this hall the faster we can get out of here . " He 'd bestowed the roughly affectionate nickname on her the first day she 'd walked into the stationhouse six years ago , her auburn hair scraped back into a braid that kept unraveling . His use of it now did n't mask his apprehension . Her gaze sharpened . " Where 's your air-pack ? " He shrugged , avoiding her frown . " Guess I 'll just have to eat the smoke . You take this room , I 'll check out the one at the end of the hall . " With a father and grandfather who 'd both been Boston firefighters , Joey knew better . But too often he arrived at a fire without his air-pack and ended up having to eat the smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloved palm on the door before pushing it open with more force than she needed . Even as her gaze took in the man standing at the window with his back to her , she knew he was going to be trouble . He was big - six foot two or three at least , to her five-six . As she entered he spoke without bothering to turn around . " Do n't worry about me , buddy , I can take care of myself . " His tone was flat . " Up until yesterday the room down the hall was unoccupied but you might want to check it out anyway . The fire 's in the ceiling , so there 's not much time . " She tamped down the spark of anger that flared in her at his offhand attitude . Except for his height and the breadth of his shoulders , it was obvious he was no different from the rest of the lost souls she 'd glimpsed as she 'd run into the building . His hair , dark brown and too long , brushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better days . The leather of his military-style shoes was cracked . He was n't a junkie . His build was too solid for a drug user , so the addiction that had brought him to a room in this rundown building had to have been alcohol . Still , he 'd travelled so far down the road to self-destruction he could n't even recognize how much danger he was in . But he 'd known the fire was in the ceiling , and he 'd known what that meant . She did n't have time to wonder how or when he 'd gained that kind of knowledge . " My partner 's checking it out . " From another part of the building came a muffled crash as something fell . " You 're my responsibility , mister . Let 's move . " He 'd obviously assumed she was a man , because at her first words he 'd turned to face her , his eyes widening as they met hers . Now he gave her a hard smile . She blinked , feeling as if a tiny shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department physical so you 're probably pretty strong , honey , but I 've got almost a foot on you and I 'm a whole lot heavier . I do n't see you getting me through that door if I do n't want to go . " His shrug was dismissive . " Find your partner and the two of you get out while you can . " His eyes were the color of smoke - so pale in the tan of his face that it seemed as though they were looking through her . The tan she could understand , even in an unseasonably wet Boston May . Men like him picked up odd jobs , usually outdoor work , to pay for their habit . His age was impossible to pinpoint . From the hard planes and blunt angles of his face he looked to be in his mid-thirties , but though his smile had held little humor and no warmth , for the briefest of instants it had transformed his whole expression . Not so long ago the man in front of her had been a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now there was a destructively dangerous aura about him , what impact had that smile had on women before his life had spiralled out of control ? Who cares , King ? Abruptly she shoved her speculations aside . The man 's past did n't concern her . How and why he 'd arrived at this dead end was n't her business . Her job was to get him out of here , whether he wanted to go or not . But that was n't going to be easy . The sleeves of his sweatshirt were pushed up to his elbows , and the corded muscles of his forearms and the strength of those hands looked formidable . Squaring her shoulders , she clamped a gloved hand on his arm . " That 's not the way it works , " she said , some of the anger she 'd tried to suppress seeping through into her voice . " I 'm a firefighter . If you understood anything at all about what that means you 'd know I ca n't walk away and leave you here . " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under her hand his arm felt like a slab of rock maple . His tone was even harder . " Let me put in words you 'll understand , honey . I do n't want you risking your life for someone like me . " " Then both of us just ran out of luck , honey , " Tamara grated , her grip on him tightening . " Because risking my life is part of the job , and I 'm not about to make an exception in your case . " For the space of a heartbeat their gazes locked , hers coldly stubborn , his opaquely unreadable . Then he exhaled sharply , his posture rigid . " My conscience seems to have taken everything else I 've thrown at it over the years , but even I 've got my limits , " he said , his tone tight . " You win . Let 's find your partner and get the hell out of here . " The whole encounter had taken only seconds , but somehow she felt as if she 'd just gone ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicality , she thought as she stepped out into the hall , acutely aware of the man behind her . What the hell was his problem ? ( Continues ... )
