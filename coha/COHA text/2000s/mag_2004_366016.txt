Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have sold 42 million books by fictionalizing the Biblical End Times in the Left Behind series . But this fall their Christian publisher , Tyndale House , launched a rival series directly challenging the premise that born-again Christians will be " raptured " into heaven while those " left behind " face the anti-Christ during the Apocalypse . LaHaye was not amused when Tyndale asked him to debate his new competition , Christian-radio host Hank Hanegraaff , as a promotion . Hanegraaff 's novel , The Last Disciple , argues that the Book of Revelation describes the persecution of 1st century Christians under Nero , not some future tribulation of nonbelievers . " A lot of Christians have been hoodwinked into this amillennial viewpoint , " says LaHaye . " I 'm not going to promote that flawed theory . " <P> Hanegraaff , known as the Bible Answer Man , counters that the Left Behind books are part of a trend toward sensationalism and " script torture " of the Bible . " There is a lot of hysteria because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer the alternate viewpoint after talking to biblical scholars . " We think debate is healthy in the church and will help both series , " says publisher Ron Beers . The Last Disciple , one of three books planned by Hanegraaff and his co-author , Sigmund Brouwer , has sold 50,000 copies in six weeks ( vs. 85,000 for Left Behind in its first year ) . But LaHaye says he is n't worried . He plans to deliver the four books he owes Tyndale and let readers decide how this story ends .  --  By Cathy Booth Thomas
