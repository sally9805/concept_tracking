Ralph Waldo Emerson once said , " The mark of the man of the world is absence of pretension . " Oh , if Emerson could only see us now . BY JOE QUEENAN // Many years ago I fled New York City for its tony northern suburbs . Some friends actually believed that I relocated to Westchester County because I wanted to put down roots , but the truth is I left New York to get away from pretentious people . By the time the moving van arrived , I 'd had it up to here with friends prattling on about Rainer Werner Fassbinder , Umberto Eco and the Kronos Quartet or rhapsodizing about the director 's cut of Satyajit Ray 's Father Panchali . The thing I liked about the suburbs-other than the panoramic vistas and short lines at the post office-was that pretentious people generally felt out of place there . Over the years , the suburbs had consistently failed to address the needs of the constitutionally pretentious , refusing to erect the infrastructure of intellectual ostentation that makes Manhattan , Boston and San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Gehry museums and swanky arthouse cinemas , pretentious people living outside the major metropoli were forced to drive into the city in order to satisfy their craving for clever apercus and witty repartee . Though museums do exist in campagna , they have never been able to marshal the resources to mount anything resembling the Whitney 's massive 2000 exhibition of Barbara Kruger 's ironic , prefab banalities . This was the sort of show that affords the cognoscenti a chance to trade thoughts on postmodern semiotics , feminist deconstructionism and subversive neo-Marxist graphic design while on their lunch breaks from Morgan Stanley . Sadly , in the suburbs , such opportunities rarely presented themselves . So locals had to stick with traditional favorites : reminiscing about the good old days at Exeter , correcting the maid 's pronunciation of " Cabernet , " bragging about having never seen Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and pretending not to know who Eminem is . It is not that the suburbs lack pretentious inhabitants ; my own circle of friends includes several who would gladly ford raging torrents for the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carne film ( provided it was the version originale ) . The problem for these people has never been the will to be pretentious ; it has always been a question of venue . I do not mean to suggest that I myself am incapable of cultural name-dropping or the cunningly rehearsed bon mot . A lifelong Francophile , I am as comfortable discussing thematic inconsistencies in the work of Abbe Prevost as I am chatting about the influence of Valenciennes on Theodore-though not Le Douanier-Rousseau . But by the time my first child was born , I honestly felt that I had outgrown pretentiousness , which seemed like an undergraduate affectation . Besides , while my children were small , I was so burdened by the responsibilities of fatherhood that I did not have time to be pretentious . I was too busy watching films like Curly Sue . For many years I enjoyed my sojourn in the provinces . But not so long ago I noticed that things were changing . People I was accustomed to chatting with exclusively about ice hockey and school taxes suddenly began alluding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Astor Piazzolla . Oh , no ! Pretentiousness was coming to my neighborhood . It started quietly , with the Hudson Valley Writers ' Center , which offered such classes as " Tapping Creativity : Dreams , Mandalas and Shaping Images Into Writing , " not to mention " Writing as Healing . " Sadly , this was but the first manifestation of an intellectual efflorescence that would soon engulf the county , a cultural Blitzkrieg that would send lowbrows into hiding , leaving nothing prosaic in its wake . In short order came the dainty tea shops with I Puritani playing in the background , and the poetry readings by the local baristas leveling hoi polloi with a fusillade of pith . And then , inevitably , the bookstore clerks who acted as if anyone buying a John Grisham novel-while Eco went ignored-should be deported . Molto , molto raffinato . Much as I was disconcerted by the rising tide of snootiness , I still felt that there was something piecemeal , unfocused and therefore harmless about this onslaught . The vortex lacked an epicenter ; my beloved county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ravenous appetites of the pretentious on a daily basis . Then , in 2001 , the Jacob Burns Film Genter arrived . Yes , the tipping point was the opening of an art-house cinema , the one-stop shopping center for the self-important . For decades , the dinky Fine Arts Cinema in Scarsdale was the only theater in all of Westchester where it was possible to see a riveting three-hour movie about the making of The Mikado and then have a lofty tete-a-tete afterward . But the Fine Arts had only one screen and a Lilliputian lobby , forcing patrons to huddle outside in the freezing cold , waiting to see the movie in which Holly Hunter gets dragged overboard by a grand piano attached to her ankle . Now risking pneumonia is no longer required . Incongruously positioned in Pleasantville 's nondescript " down-town , " the Burns center is an upscale , no-riffraff arts complex that not only shows nightly screenings of BelgoBosnian black comedies but hosts gatherings at which audience members are encouraged to air their own exquisitely handcrafted opinions on the films . Thus , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-aged woman grandiosely stood up and opined that the film " resembled an Impressionist painting . " Expressing such a view was a dicey affair ; the Impressionists were known for outdoor , sunlit , pastel-colored , intellectually contentless scenes set in 19th-century France , whereas Altman 's astringent analysis of the class system was set almost entirely indoors in dark , brooding , rainy 20th-century England . No matter . What signified was that after so many years of insulation from the lips of the lofty and the perceptions of the perspicacious , I now found myself gazing directly into the eye of the pretentiousness storm . The Gosford Parks incident was the first time since I had moved to the suburbs that I no longer felt at home . Now , I am not suggesting that my idea of civilization is a twelve-plex with nine screens showing Adam Sandier films . But consider the alternative . First the Burns center exhumed the works of Jean Gabin . Then it staged an Eric Rohmer film festival . Most recently it screened Neil Jordan 's dreary remake of Jean-Pierre Melville 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this seance was that only three people in the room ( seating capacity : 250 ) had seen the original Bob le Flambeur-my wife and I were two of them-suggesting that what we had on our hands here was bargain-basement pretentiousness : faux snobs prepared to carry out the hoity-toity crime without having done the highfalutin time . This was the coup de grace , the Sturm und Drang , the elisir d'amore the je ne sais quoi and the sine qua non all rolled into one . Yes , the vita had been bella . But it was bella nomore . Sadly , the time has come to say auf Wiedersehen , a plus tard , ciao . Arctic Circle , here I come . Author Affiliation Humorist Joe Queenan provides an urgently needed send-up of pretension in this month 's " Social Graces " column ( page 70 ) . " If you live someplace where there is n't a lot of pretentiousness , enjoy it , because it 's not going to last , " he warns . A native of Philadelphia , Queenan now resides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight books , including If You 're Talking to Me , Your Career Must Be in Trouble ( 1994 ) and True Bclievcrs:The Tragic Inner Life of Sports Fans , published last month . // <p>
