Ford 's SVT program proved Detroit can tweak an econo-car into a hot rod . And then there was the return of the Z ... Certainly enough to tide us over . AUDI RS6 It may look like an ordinary sedan , but it moves you like a kick in the pants . Tuned by Quattro GmbH in the spirit of BMW 's M5 , Audi 's all-new RS6 is powered by a 450-horsepower twin-turbo V8 that gets it to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds .

It 's quite simple : They won last year . Many new car introductions happen as this issue goes to press . We 're able to drive some ( often in preproduction form ) ; others are n't yet available . Among the cars we could n't drive and therefore could n't consider this year : the Nissan Murano , Porsche Cayenne , Chrysler Crossfire and Pacifica , and Chevy SSR . Also missing from our list are the first production fuel cell cars from Toyota and Honda , scheduled to hit the streets in California this month . We ultimately decided against them because the " production " run will be tiny , and ordinary consumers wo n't be able to buy them .
