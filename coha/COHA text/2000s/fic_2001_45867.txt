HEY SAID TO ME : " THE T'KAI have no words for time . They also appear not to die . We 're sending you to investigate . " <p> The surface of their planet was continuously bathed in radiation from the many nearby suns . There was no sunset , no dawn . No one should have been able to live there , but the T'kai seemed to prosper . <p> I wore a protective suit so thick that auxiliary motors were necessary to move the arms and legs . My rest periods were spent in an eight-by-six tomb of lead . The tomb 's electronics were old-fashioned and half mechanical because the radiation ate up anything more advanced . When I closed my eyes , there were flashes of light against the inner sides of my eyelids . A leak somewhere , a leak that might kill me if I did n't find it . <p> The Northern Tribe accepted my presence without any fuss or bother . Where there was no time , where there was no death , there was also no fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All you had to remember was that it had no whens in it , no nows , no yesterdays or tomorrows . <p> They were a squat humanoid race with purplish-brown skin . The females had appendages like udders just beneath their ribs . They not only fed their young with them , they fed every non-female in the tribe . That was because they were the only eaters , the only sex that could digest the thick rubbery grass . In fact , that was the tribal name for female . Eater . Grazer . <p> The H'do , the leader , patiently answered my questions . Or to be more accurate , patiently failed to answer them . <p> " If you never die , why do you need to have young ? " <p> " What is young ? What is never ? What is die ? " <p> These were not the words I used because they had no such words . Rather I approached these words through gesture and simile and circumlocution . <p> " Why are there not more of you ? If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have filled the planet by now . " <p> " What is now ? What is diet " <p> He paused a moment and stared at me with eyes that saw not in the visible spectrum but in the region of X-rays . <p> " What is planet ? " <p> The females grazed . The males sat in circles and chanted or sat alone lost in a mindless torpor . In season they impregnated the females with their comical sexual equipment . <p> As there was no tomorrow , they need not plan for it . <p> As there was no death , they suffered no anxiety nor did they feel the need for a religion . <p> " What happens when the grass fails ? " I asked . <p> " What is when ? ' <p> I tried again . " Grass fails . Females receive no sustenance . You receive no sustenance . Everybody stares . " <p> He stared at me , pu=led . <p> " Grass is not failed , " he said . <p> During rest periods - when the flood of radiation static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm learning nothing . Their language is too simple for my questions . You were right . Entropy has been violated and there appears to be no death . " <p> Then I lay in my darkened tomb watching the flashes of light . Frequently I was sick . I was sick when I went outside in my protective suit . I had to rig a catch bag beneath my chin . <p> They do n't die , I thought . But I will . <p> I called the mother ship . <p> " Take me out of this place . I 'm ill . There 's a leak somewhere in the shielding and I ca n't find it . " <p> A single message came back through the rattling pop of the static . Continue your mission . <p> I did a headcount of the tribe . <p> " There are less of you , " I told the H'do . <p> " Some go with the dancers . " <p> " What are the dancers ? " <p> He imitated their strange awkward step , then stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . <p> " When the dancers come again , you must tell me so that I can observe them . " <p> " What is when ? " <p> I returned to the tomb where I was violently ill . I spent an extra rest period there , trying to recover . I was losing weight because I could no longer eat solid food . <p> I pleaded with my masters over the communicator . <p> " Take me off this planet . " <p> And over the pop and hiss , contin - mis <p> I began to feel very weak . I spent hours like the T'kai males sitting in a torpor . Once I wasted an entire day - my time , not the planet 's watching the females graze . There was nothing bovine in their grazing nor did it resemble human feeding . It was wholly their own , wholly alien , wholly T'kai . I did another headcount . Again there were less . I went to the H'do . <p> " The dancers - have they come again ? " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There- do you see ? " <p> There was a line of T'kai far off . They moved with an awkward rocking motion , first left , then right . Their feet fell heavily as if trying to nail themselves to the ground . They were dancers all right - dancers in zombie-like slow motion . <p> I followed after them . My motor driven suit moved on its own , allowing me simply to hang there , sweating and sick , as I tracked their progress . <p> I followed , them for many hours through the tall grass beyond where the females grazed . I went on as long as I could , then turned back with my terrible knowledge . <p> As soon as I got back to the tomb , I went to the communicator . " Can you hear me out there ? CAN YOU HEAR ME ? " <p> Nothing but the sound of static rain . " There is death here , but it happens where the healthy do n't see it . The dying come by in small groups , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hours through the tall vegetation , one group after another . At each step another of them dies until there are none left . I have seen their mummified bodies where the grass has sucked all the nutrients from them and replenished itself . I have seen them in their thousands - in their millions . Entropy is not violated . Death is alive and well throughout the universe . Now will you take me out of here ? " No answer but the static rain . Then : Continue your mission . <p> I could keep no food down at all now and very little in the way of liquids . My hair came out in bunches . For days - my days  --  I lay sweating and naked in my leaden tomb . My mind seemed to drift off somewhere in the darkness and grow dim and diffuse . Then far off I heard a feeble cry . Not a real cry , but an emanation of the very atmosphere . <p> The dancers are coming , I thought . They 're coming for me . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time . I activated the servo motors . I left my tomb and sought out the H'do . I stood before him , swaying . " I 'm dying , " I said . <p> " What is dying ? " <p> I could see the dancers , approaching from afar . I pointed at them . " That is dying . " I began getting out of my protective suit . " You go with the dancers ? " the H'do asked . I did n't answer . I did n't have the energy . <p> I took a long time getting out of the suit . Long enough for the dancers to make their slow , awkward approach . Eventually - somehow - I stood naked and swaying beside their path . Already the bath of radiation was turning my skin a purplish brown . <p> The dancers were abreast of us now . I took a step forward , then another step . I joined the end of the line . It was easy to follow their dance . It was my dance now . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Soon the radiation took my sight away . No matter . Who needed sight for this sort of dance ? In my ears I heard the static - or was it merely the whisper of the tall grass ? In my ears I heard a voice far off . <p> Continue your mission , it said . <p> Author Affiliation
