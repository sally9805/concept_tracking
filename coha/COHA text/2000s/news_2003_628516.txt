<p> WHEN Marsha Recknagel 's first book , If Nights Could Talk , arrived at Brazos Bookstore , she was out of town . But the Houston author was so thrilled about it that she sent a friend with a cell phone to report on how the stack of books looked in the store . <p> " I was more excited about that than having the book published , " says Recknagel , who teaches creative writing at Rice University . " The day the book arrived at Karl 's bookstore was the day I knew I had arrived . " <p> For many writers with literary ambitions , there is no better place than Karl Kilian 's little corner of the universe . Nearly 20 years ago ( SEE CORRECTION ) , the gentlemanly book lover set out to create a serious bookstore in Houston that would serve as a gathering spot for people who treasure the printed word . <p> Many of the best writers in the country read their work at the bookstore in a small strip shopping center on Bissonnet near Kirby . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Houston Creative Writing Program and Rice . <p> It regularly sponsors such varied events as marathon public readings of Beowulf and Dante 's The Inferno , and a screening of Andy Warhol 's Empire in the store parking lot . <p> " In terms of developing a literary culture in Houston , Karl is the heart of that , " says poet Edward Hirsch , a faculty member in the UH Creative Writing Program for 17 years before moving to New York last year to become president of the Guggenheim Foundation . Hirsch returned to the store last month to read from his new book of poems , Lay Back the Darkness . <p> " It did n't feel published to me unless I read at Brazos first , " he says . <p> Kilian 's admirers say the store reminds them of him : It 's warm , literate , serious but not stuffy . Customers are encouraged to browse as long as they want - a sofa designed by Charles James and two Mies van der Rohe chairs invite lounging - and discuss books in a setting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of people through this bookstore , " says poet Susan Wood , chair of the English department at Rice , who drops in several times a week . " It 's sort of a social center , as well as a literary center . " <p> Maintaining a small , independent bookstore in the face of tough competition from superstore chains and Internet discounters has n't been easy . <p> At one point in the early 1990s , business dropped off so much that Kilian sent a letter begging customers who had been tempted away by lower prices to come back . <p> " It helped , " he says . " But you can only play that hand of cards once . " <p> Many small competitors - Book Den , Books Inc. , Cobbler 's , Sam Houston Bookstore , Spectrum Books , Post Oak Books - went out of business . Independents that survived - such as Murder by the Book , River Oaks Bookstore and Aquarian Age Bookshelf - carved out niches , offering customers specialized titles and personal service . <p> At Brazos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited-edition volume on Dutch architect Rem Koolhaus published in Spain , a book of lavish photographs of Baroque churches in Mexico with text in Japanese , slim volumes of poetry from a little-known Massachusetts publisher - and honed his knack for anticipating his customers ' tastes . <p> " We 've always been able to move pretty quickly , " he says . " When they 're announcing the Nobel Prizes , we 're here sitting on the phone looking at the publisher 's Web site to order those books . " <p> Superstores now rarely discount anything except New York Times best sellers , he says . <p> Brazos stays competitive by offering 20 percent off all travel books and 25 percent off selected novels . <p> Although the economic struggle continues , Kilian is n't thinking of closing up shop any time soon . <p> In a storeroom adjoining his office , surrounded by towering boxes of books - as many as 30 boxes are delivered every business day - the 59-year-old bookstore owner is as gleeful as a kid with a new chest of toys . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to do , " he says . " Every day is like Christmas . " <p> As a child Kilian loved books . In a family of readers in Houston , he often read the same books his sister read . <p> " We were competitive , " he recalls . " I probably read more Nancy Drew than Hardy Boys . But the one book I was crazy about was Richard Halliburton 's Complete Book of Marvels . I loved the idea of adventure . This was the book that opened up all those magical worlds to me . " <p> Still , baseball took precedence until sixth grade . That year he was severely burned on the right side of his body when friends threw too much gasoline on a campfire . He underwent a succession of surgeries and had to give up his favorite sport . <p> But his love of books remained . <p> He graduated on time with his class at St. Thomas High School in 1961 and pursued a degree in English and art history at the University of St. Thomas .

" She was even a little plump for a while . She was good-natured and very funny . These are things that people forget . " <p> After Jermayne MacAgy , who headed the art-history department , died unexpectedly of diabetes in 1964 , Dominique de Menil took on a more active role as director . Students often were invited to dinner parties at the de Menil home , where they were expected to hold their own with such luminaries as architect Buckminster Fuller and film director Michelangelo Antonioni . <p> Kilian accompanied de Menil and surrealist master Rene Magritte , along with the artist 's wife , dog and the dog 's nanny , to the rodeo . He met filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard and Roberto Rossellini , artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was really exciting to be around those people , because the quality was so good , " Kilian says . " It gave you the feeling that you might be geographically displaced a little bit here , but it did n't mean you were culturally displaced . A significant culture could be built . It just took the people who wanted to do it . " <p> When Kilian pursued graduate degrees in English and art history at New York University in 1965 , he lived for a while in one of the de Menils ' houses with childhood friend and fellow St. Thomas student Fred Hughes . <p> In 1967 , Kilian was there when Hughes met Andy Warhol at a fund-raiser for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company , hosted by the de Menils and Philip Johnson , at the architect 's home in New Canaan , Conn . Hughes became Warhol 's business manager and was instrumental in the artist 's success . <p> Kilian dropped out of school in 1971 when he realized he would have a hard time finding a teaching job , given the glut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bookstore across the street from campus looking for a job and was hired as manager . <p> The bookstore , founded by Pete Martin , who also had started City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco , was a literary and political hangout that attracted such notables as Nobel laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer , Susan Sontag and Ring Lardner . <p> A year and a half later , Kilian returned to Houston with the grand idea of opening a serious literary bookstore similar to the one he 'd been managing in New York . He raised $ 22,000 from six backers and his father - he did n't ask de Menil for money because he did n't want to complicate their friendship - and opened Brazos Bookstore in 1974 . <p> Kilian wanted to name the store Spindletop , until he found out that the revolving restaurant atop the new Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Houston had taken it . He settled on Brazos Bookstore because he liked the alliteration and wanted a Texas-sounding name . <p> He chose a location on Bissonnet near Greenbriar , a few blocks east of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly opened Texas Gallery and Janie C. Lee Gallery . <p> He emphasized books that reflected his interests in literature ( fiction , drama , poetry , literary criticism ) and the visual arts . Those areas remain the store 's strongest , while he has added travel books , cookbooks and children 's books to serve the changing interests of his clientele . <p> From the beginning , Kilian wanted to feature national writers . But at the time , Texas was n't on any publisher 's literary map . It took more than two years of pleading before one sent Jerzy Kosinski , author of the controversial Painted Bird , to read from his new book , Blind Date , in 1977 . <p> " Once we could say Kosinski had come , others began to follow , " Kilian says . <p> Since then a succession of famous authors - Doris Lessing , Gunter Grass , Tom Wolfe , Amy Tan , Martin Amis , to name a few - has visited the store .

" That 's been a strength for the writing program , the Glassell School ( of Art ) and the Shepherd School of Music ( at Rice University ) . Once those students get down here , they tend to stay . You get a lot of room here for not a lot , and it 's pretty easy to get around . " <p> Kilian often works out of a back room at the store . His wife , Kathy , handles the front .

Smalley . <p> " It 's that old Menil thing rearing its head , " Kilian says of his love for putting together art exhibitions . " We all want to be curators .
