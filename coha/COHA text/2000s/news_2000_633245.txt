<p> The toilet seats are down . There are no dirty socks on the floor . ESPN ? Not allowed . <p> In a hotel suite dominated by three of Hollywood 's biggest talents , estrogen is everywhere . Meg Ryan pats the hand of Diane Keaton and says , " Do you want lemon in your tea , honey ? " <p> Yes , this is a girl thing . <p> " I think we really do look like sisters today . We 're blond . We 're stressed . We 're all left-handed , " marvels Ryan , who is the first to arrive . She is the cheerleader of the group . Keaton shows up next , a den mother . Kudrow is the kid sis who has grownup worries : Her son has diaper rash . " The worst ! " cries Ryan . Keaton nods sympathetically . <p> In " Hanging Up " ( opening Friday ) , based on the life of director Nora Ephron and her novelist sister Delia , the talented trio play sisters who are dealing with their aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's modern woman . <p> These screen sisters can clearly relate . <p> Q. Did you girls really have a Ouija board on the set ? And let 's get it out now if you have it on you . <p> RYAN : Oh , my God , who told you about the Ouija board ? I want names ! Yes , it is true . We were really into talking to a particular spirit . We kept asking , " Will this movie be a hit ? " ( She laughs . ) <p> KEATON : We would ask the spirit , " When are we going to wrap today ? " and then we would get this reading of 7:04 p.m. , and that would be when we wrapped ! <p> KUDROW : Let 's just say it was a really fun makeup trailer . <p> Q. How did you connect as sisters ? <p> RYAN : I would just look at these two . I really , really like these women . To tell you the truth , hair and makeup on most movies is such a drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my day on this movie , I would sit there with these women and we had a ball . <p> Q. Meg , you always look so casually fantastic . That takes almost two hours ? <p> RYAN : Honey , sometimes it takes three hours ! An hour , minimum ! <p> Q. Your girlfriend Diane also directed this movie . Was she tough ? <p> RYAN : Let me tell you my favorite memory of Diane directing . There 's a scene in this movie where we 're all crying hysterically . Diane staged it in such a way that both she and Lisa had their heads on my shoulder . I 'm weeping away , and then while I 'm pouring out my guts , Diane suddenly whispers to me , " Are you done acting yet ? Should I say cut ? " <p> Q. Diane , how did you connect with this material ? <p> KEATON : I am one of three sisters . In fact , so are Meg and Lisa , which is so weird . Also , I just love the themes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also liked playing the famous sister in the movie . That struck me , because in a family where one person is famous , it seems the others get neglected . And the funny thing is , the famous person is often the one you do n't want to be around . <p> Q. You want to give some names , Diane ? <p> KEATON : ( Laughing . ) No ! NO ! I do n't know anybody like that in real life . <p> Q. This is a movie about siblings and how birth order determines who is the responsible one , the screw-up and the indulged one . Lisa , you were the baby of the sisters . Did you run wild ? <p> KUDROW : No , I was like a freak . I had a self-imposed curfew . In high school , I would pretend that my parents were more strict than they were so I could get out of doing things I did n't want to do . For instance , if a guy wanted to make out , I 'd say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then my boyfriend would say , " But Lisa , your parents are out of town . " I was quick . I would immediately add , " Oh , but my brother is staying with me and he 's very strict . " The guy would say , " But you do n't even have a brother . " <p> KEATON : I was the oldest , but not the caretaker . My mother was constantly encouraging me to explore the world . She was like , " I 'll take care of the kids . " I never even baby-sat . <p> Q. And Meg ? <p> RYAN : Just like in the movie , I was the middle of three sisters . I was a bit of a caregiver . I have always felt like the responsible one . And there have been times where I hated being the responsible one . But then I had to realize , " Meg , you bring this on yourself . " <p> Q. There 's a subplot about an estranged mother in this movie , which seems autobiographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own mother . Did you ever think this was too close to home ? <p> RYAN : When I read the script , I always knew I 'd get a question about this subject . Obviously , there are parallels to my life . But it 's not my story . In fact , doing those mother scenes in the movie was fun . I was laughing . <p> Q. Meg , you play Eve , who is stressed out all the time . She 's trying to juggle work and a very demanding family . Did you relate ? <p> RYAN : I did this movie because I know that kind of stress . But I 'm not special . I go out to lunch with my girlfriends and every one of us is overwhelmed by all the things we 're supposed to be doing . Women had no choices for so long , and now we have so many choices . We 're overwhelmed by all this stuff we 're supposed to be doing . We 're not running our lives . We 're run around by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough time saying " no " to things ? <p> KEATON : Ai n't that the truth . It 's almost impossible for me to say no . I hate the word no . For instance , the other day a strange man came up to me  --  which by the way does n't happen often  --  and he said , " I 'd like to go out and have a drink with you . " I was like , " Uh , oh , um , yes , OK . " Meanwhile , I have no interest . I did n't end up going . I just could n't say no ! <p> KUDROW : As women , we 're not taught to stand up straight and say , " You know what ? Forget it ! " But it feels good to say it . Women should try it . Tomorrow , if you 're a girl reading this , say no for me one time . OK ? <p> Q. What do you do when you 're at maximum stress level ? Jamie Lee Curtis says she eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down . <p> RYAN : Oh , I love shredded wheat out of the box ! But even better when I 'm stressed , I start maniacally cleaning my house . I start picking things up . I start organizing , because my stress comes from when things feel unorganized in my brain . <p> KEATON : My stress buster comes from my dad . He would work really hard all day , but the minute he came home , he 'd turn it off . Let go ! Goodbye ! That 's what I do . <p> Q. Let 's talk about men for a moment . What 's the single most outrageous thing a man has ever done to you on a movie set ? <p> RYAN : On this movie , I find Walter Matthau in bed with a lady . Well , I opened this bedroom door and Walter mooned me , Diane and Lisa . None of us could believe it . He 's naked ! That scream in this film is our honest reaction to seeing him . By the way , we only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you know your mate was the proverbial One ? <p> KUDROW : My husband was dating my roommate . I know it sounds horrible , but I did n't start dating him until six years later . See , I always try for the decent thing . Anyway , this French girl roommate is happy . She has a baby now , so leave me alone . But I just knew it was love the first time I looked into his kind eyes . <p> RYAN : I saw Dennis standing there in his T-shirt on the set of " Innerspace " ( 1987 ) and I noticed he had a really nice body . It was a purely physical reaction at first , because my brain said , " Oh , no ! You do not want to fall in love . " Then Dennis told me we lived in the same New York neighborhood and he had been noticing me for years . Is n't that the sweetest , weirdest thing ? <p> Q. Lisa , you 're just starting . How has motherhood changed your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of ambition that I have about work . For instance , I said no to " Analyze This " and then I got talked into it , thank God . I mean , that was good , but it was hard . When we shot , my son was 3 weeks old , and I just felt like a bad person . I mean , how ambitious do you have to be ? <p> Q. How has fame affected your life ? <p> KUDROW : Diane and Meg just do n't let it affect them . I 've been in a restaurant with them , and no one came over to the table . But when you 're on " Friends , " it 's a different story . People feel like they can bother you at any moment . Let 's just say I 'm nothing like Phoebe from " Friends . " As a person , I 'm not that open . I 'm not warm . I 'm not a good person ! <p> Q. Do you stress out about aging in Hollywood ? Ever think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> RYAN : I like lines . You 've earned them . And you can be in a lot of movies with lines . We need to stop whining about it and create our own projects , like this one . <p> KEATON : In fact , except for maybe five names , women and men in Hollywood are in the same boat . It 's not easy for anyone to get in front of the camera , but I like a natural-looking face , too . <p> Q. But does n't it bug you to see Catherine Zeta-Jones as the love interest for Sean Connery , a man old enough to be her great-great-grandfather ? Why is n't it Diane Keaton starring opposite Harrison Ford ? <p> KEATON : That would n't be bad , because , you know , Harrison is the sexiest man alive . People magazine says it and they 're always right . ( She laughs . ) Honestly , I do n't get mad . Let 's say someone did want to put me and Richard Gere together . The movie is probably still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart about my part ? I do n't think so . <p> Q. Do you have a favorite place to unwind ? <p> KUDROW : It 's in the kitchen . At my island . I have barstools and a little TV . I can do everything in there . <p> Q. Favorite movie that makes you cry ? <p> RYAN : I 'm thinking " Splendor in the Grass . " I love when Natalie Wood is in the tub and has her breakdown . I always feel like I 'm having the experience with her . I saw it when I was a teenager . I sat there <p> sobbing . <p> Q. Goofiest thing we would never figure you doing ? <p> KEATON : The other night , I 'm dancing around with my daugher singing Winnie the Pooh and Tigger songs ! Hey , I 'm pretty good ! My voice and Pooh ? We could cut an album ! <p> RYAN : Wait , that 's not so goofy . Have I told you about me and Barney ? <p> Distributed by Big Picture News Inc.
