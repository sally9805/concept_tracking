Suicide bombers are easy to spot . They give out all kinds of tell-tale signs . Mostly because they 're nervous . By definition they 're all first-timers . <br> Israeli counterintelligence wrote the defensive playbook . They told us what to look for . They used pragmatic observation and psychological insight and came up with a list of behavioral indicators . I learned the list from an Israeli amy captain twenty years ago . He swore by it . Therefore I swore by it too , because at the time I was on three weeks ' detached duty mostly about a yard from his shoulder , in Israel itself , in Jerusalem , on the West Bank , in Leb anon , sometimes in Syria , sometimes in Jordan , on buses , in stores , on crowded sidewalks . I kept my eyes moving and my mind running free down the bullet points . <br> Twenty years later I still know the list . And my eyes still move . Pure habit . From another bunch of guys I learned another mantra : Look , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more you engage , the longer you survive . <br> The list is twelve points long if you 're looking at a male suspect . Eleven , if you 're looking at a woman . The difference is a fresh shave . Male bombers take off their beards . It helps them blend in . Makes them less suspicious . The result is paler skin on the lower half of the face . No recent exposure to the sun . <br> But I was n't interested in shaves . <br> I was working on the eleven-point list . <br> I was looking at a woman . <br> I was riding the subway , in New York City . The 6 train , the Lexington Avenue local , heading uptown , two o'clock in the morning . I had gotten on at Bleecker Street from the south end of the platform into a car that was empty except for five people . Subway cars feel small and intimate when they 're full . When they 're empty they feel vast and cavernous and lonely . At night their lights feel hotter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in the day . They 're all the lights there are . I was sprawled on a two-person bench north of the end doors on the track side of the car . The other five passengers were all south of me on the long bench seats , in profile , side on , far from each other , staring blankly across the width of the car , three on the left and two on the right . <br> The car 's number was 7622 . I once rode eight stops on the 6 train next to a crazy person who talked about the car we were in with the same kind of enthusiasm that most men reserve for sports or women . Therefore I knew that car number 7622 was an R142A model , the newest on the New York system , built by Kawasaki in Kobe , Japan , shipped over , trucked to the 207th Street yards , craned onto the tracks , towed down to 180th Street and tested . I knew it could run two hundred thousand miles without major attention . I knew its automated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information in a woman 's , which was claimed to be a coincidence but was really because the transportation chiefs believed such a division of labor was psychologically compelling . I knew the voices came from Bloomberg TV , but years before Mike became mayor . I knew there were six hundred R142As on the tracks and that each one was a fraction over fifty-one feet long and a little more than eight feet wide . I knew that the no-cab unit like we had been in then and I was in now had been designed to carry a maximum of forty people seated and up to 148 standing . The crazy person had been clear on all that data . I could see for myself that the car 's seats were blue plastic , the same shade as a late summer sky or a British Air Force uniform . I could see that its wall panels were molded from graffiti-resistant fiberglass . I could see its twin strips of advertisements running away from me where the wall panels met the roof . I could see small cheerful posters touting television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning opportunities . <br> I could see a police notice advising me : If you see something , say something . <br> The nearest passenger to me was a Hispanic woman . She was across the car from me , on my left , forward of the first set of doors , all alone on a bench built for eight , well off center . She was small , somewhere between thirty and fifty , and she looked very hot and very tired . She had a well-worn supermarket bag looped over her wrist and she was staring across at the empty place opposite with eyes too weary to be seeing much . <br> Next up was a man on the other side , maybe four feet farther down the car . He was all alone on his own eight-person bench . He could have been from the Balkans , or the Black Sea . Dark hair , lined skin . He was sinewy , worn down by work and weather . He had his feet planted and he was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees . Not asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , rocking with the movements of the train . He was about fifty , dressed in clothes far too young for him . Baggy jeans that reached only his calves , and an oversized NBA shirt with a player 's name on it that I did n't recognize . <br> Third up was a woman who might have been West African . She was on the left , south of the center doors . Tired , inert , her black skin made dusty and gray by fatigue and the lights . She was wearing a colorful batik dress with a matching square of cloth tied over her hair . Her eyes were closed . I know New York reasonably well . I call myself a citizen of the world and New York the capital of the world , so I can make sense of the city the same way a Brit knows London or a Frenchman knows Paris . I 'm familiar but not intimate with its habits . But it was an easy guess that any three people like these already seated on a late-night northbound 6 train south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around City Hall , or restaurant service workers from Chinatown or Little Italy . They were probably set for Hunts Point in the Bronx , or maybe all the way up to Pelham Bay , ready for short fitful sleeps before more long days . <br> The fourth and the fifth passengers were different . <br> The fifth was a man . He was maybe my age , wedged at forty-five degrees on the two-person bench diagonally opposite me , all the way across and down the length of the car . He was dressed casually but not cheaply . Chinos , and a golf shirt . He was awake . His eyes were fixed somewhere in front of him . Their focus changed and narrowed constantly , like he was alert and speculating . They reminded me of a ballplayer 's eyes . They had a certain canny , calculating shrewdness in them . <br> But it was passenger number four that I was looking at . <br> If you see something , say something . <br> She was seated on the right side of the car , all alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway between the exhausted West African woman and the guy with the ball player 's eyes . She was white and probably in her forties . She was plain . She had black hair , neatly but unstylishly cut and too uniformly dark to be natural . She was dressed all in black . I could see her fairly well . The guy nearest to me on the right was still sitting forward and the V-shaped void between his bent back and the wall of the car made my line of sight uninterrupted except for a forest of stainless-steel grab bars . <br> Not a perfect view , but good enough to ring every bell on the eleven-point list . The bullet headings lit up like cherries on a Vegas machine . <br> According to Israeli counterintelligence I was looking at a suicide bomber . <br> <br> Chapter Two <br> I dismissed the thought immediately . Not because of racial profiling . White women are as capable of craziness as anyone else . I dismissed the thought because of tactical implausibility . The timing was wrong . The New York subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 6 train would be as good as any other and better than most . It stops under Grand Central Terminal . Eight in the morning , six at night , a crowded car , forty seated , 148 standing , wait until the doors open on packed platforms , push the button . A hundred dead , a couple of hundred grievously injured , panic , infrastructure damage , possibly fire , a major transportation hub shut down for days or weeks and maybe never really trusted again . A significant score , for people whose heads work in ways we ca n't quite understand . <br> But not at two o'clock in the morning . <br> Not in a car holding just six people . Not when Grand Central 's subway platforms would hold only drifting trash and empty cups and a couple of old homeless guys on benches . <br> The train stopped at Astor Place . The doors hissed open . No one got on . No one got off . The doors thumped shut again and the motors whined and the train moved on . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the obvious no-brainer : inappropriate clothing . By now explosive belts are as evolved as baseball gloves . Take a three-foot by two-foot sheet of heavy canvas , fold once longitudinally , and you have a continuous pocket a foot deep . Wrap the pocket around the bomber , and sew it together in back . Zippers or snaps can lead to second thoughts . Insert a stockade of dynamite sticks into the pocket all the way around , wire them up , pack nails or ball bearings into the voids , sew the top seam shut , add crude shoulder straps to take the weight . Altogether effective , but altogether bulky . The only practical concealment , an oversized garment like a padded winter parka . Never appropriate in the Middle East , and plausible in New York maybe three months in twelve . <br> But this was September , and it was as hot as summer , and ten degrees hotter underground . I was wearing a T-shirt . Passenger number four was wearing a North Face down jacket , black , puffy , shiny , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you see something , say something . <br> I took a pass on the second of the eleven points . Not immediately applicable . The second point is : a robotic walk . Significant at a checkpoint or in a crowded marketplace or outside a church or a mosque , but not relevant with a seated suspect on public transportation . Bombers walk robotically not because they 're overcome with ecstasy at the thought of imminent martyrdom , but because they 're carrying forty extra pounds of unaccustomed weight , which is biting into their shoulders through crude suspender straps , and because they 're drugged . Martyrdom 's appeal goes only so far . Most bombers are browbeaten simpletons with a slug of raw opium paste held between gum and cheek . We know this because dynamite belts explode with a characteristic doughnut-shaped pressure wave that rolls up the torso in a fraction of a nanosecond and lifts the head clean off the shoulders . The human head is n't bolted on . It just rests there by gravity , somewhat tied down by skin and muscles and tendons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do much against the force of a violent chemical explosion . My Israeli mentor told me the easiest way to determine that an open-air attack was caused by a suicide bomber rather than by a car bomb or a package bomb is to search on an eighty-or-ninety-foot radius and look for a severed human head , which is likely to be strangely intact and undamaged , even down to the opium plug in the cheek . <br> <br> The train stopped at Union Square . No one got on . No one got off . Hot air billowed in from the platform and fought the interior air conditioning . Then the doors closed again and the train moved on . <br> Points three through six are variations on a subjective theme : irritability , sweating , tics , and nervous behavior . Although in my opinion sweating is as likely to be caused by physical overheating as by nerves . The inappropriate clothing , and the dynamite . Dynamite is wood pulp soaked with nitroglycerine and molded into baton-sized sticks . Wood pulp is a good thermal insulator . So sweating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tics and the nervous behavior are valuable indicators . These people are in the last weird moments of their lives , anxious , scared of pain , woozy with narcotics . They are irrational by definition . Believing or half-believing or not really believing at all in paradise and rivers of milk and honey and lush pastures and virgins , driven by ideological pressures or by the expectations of their peers and their families , suddenly in too deep and unable to back out . Brave talk in clandestine meetings is one thing . Action is another . Hence suppressed panic , with all its visible signs . <br> Passenger number four was showing them all . She looked exactly like a woman heading for the end of her life , as surely and certainly as the train was heading for the end of the line . <br> Therefore point seven : breathing . <br> She was panting , low and controlled . In , out , in , out . Like a technique to conquer the pain of childbirth , or like the result of a ghastly shock , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear and terror . <br> In , out , in , out . <br> Point eight : suicide bombers about to go into action stare rigidly ahead . No one knows why , but video evidence and surviving eyewitnesses have been entirely consistent in their reports . Bombers stare straight ahead . Perhaps they have screwed their commitment up to the sticking point and fear intervention . Perhaps like dogs and children they feel that if they 're not seeing anyone , then no one is seeing them . Perhaps a last shred of conscience means they ca n't look at the people they 're about to destroy . No one knows why , but they all do it . <br> Passenger number four was doing it . That was for sure . She was staring across at the blank window opposite so hard she was almost burning a hole in the glass . <br> Points one through eight , check . I shifted my weight forward in my seat . <br> Then I stopped . The idea was tactically absurd . The time was wrong . <br> Then I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , and eleven were all present and correct too , and they were the most important points of all . <br> Continues ...
