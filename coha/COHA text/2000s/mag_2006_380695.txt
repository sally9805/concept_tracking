Was it worth it , of course , is only one of the questions . What were the alternatives ? What could have been done differently ? Are things getting better or worse ? And however we got here , what do we do now ? <P> As the Iraq war 's third anniversary approached , the news fed both doubts and hopes . Saddam Hussein took the stand in his trial for the first time , reminding people of what they were missing . Meanwhile , the brand-new Iraqi parliament met in a capital under curfew to pull together some kind of future amid warnings of civil war . U.S. forces launched Operation Swarmer , the biggest air assault since the invasion , to root out insurgents north of Baghdad . President Bush embraced realism : " We will see more images of chaos and carnage in the days and months to come , " he warned as he argued why that was a price worth paying . <P> This war has brought division from the start , not just among but also within us . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are still for it lie the shifting ambivalents who want this whole massive gamble to work but increasingly fear that it wo n't . Among the more ardent critics these days are pundits and policymakers who favored the strategy three years ago , even helped shape it , and are now doing a kind of public penance for their failure of foresight . Defense hawk Richard Perle , for example , has declared that the U.S. got the war right and the postwar wrong . <P> There has been a pattern for modern American wars going back to Korea : broad public support at the outset , growing concern as casualties rise or progress stalls and then a new resolutioneither do what it takes to win or get us out . In Vietnam , nine years passed after the first U.S. servicemen were killed and more than 20,000 others died before a majority of Americans concluded we were on the wrong course . Opinion swung more quickly this time , as the cost-benefit analysis changed . When the weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) were n't found and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receded . However generous and idealistic Americans may be , a half-a-trillion-dollar nation-building venture is a harder case to make . <P> So support for the war thickens and thins as events unfold . While polls showed that 68% of Americans were in favor of the invasion three years ago , that figure fell as what looked like a quick victory stalled , rose when Saddam was pulled from his spider hole , sank with the sickening pictures from Abu Ghraib , but then rose a bit again as Iraqis defied threats and went to the polls , setting an example for a region where free elections are about as common as leprechauns . In recent weeks the bombing of a Shi'ite shrine , the bodies dumped in shallow graves , the girls blown up on the way to school , the dwindling faith not in U.S. abilities and intentions but in Iraq'sall drove down support for the war again . <P> So was it worth it ? In a Gallup poll last week , 60% of those surveyed said no . In the pages that follow , a diverse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached by TIME refused to answer . Perhaps they share the view expressed last week in Sydney by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice : " I think the outcome , the judgment , of all of this needs to await history . "
