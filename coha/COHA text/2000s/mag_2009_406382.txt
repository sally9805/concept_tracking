I was recently in Hong Kong , a crowded city of seven mil- lion . And yet , amid the thousands of high-rise apartments pressing one against the other with laundry hanging from windows , I found community parks - open spaces where young people meet to play basketball , older people find a place to practise tai chi , and small children climb com- pact but interesting play structures . One evening we were having a casual dinner at an outdoor market restaurant and my partner 's nephews , seven-year-old Jack and five- year-old Max , were getting restless with all the adult con- versation . I offered to take them to the town centre , where a playground and basketball court beckoned . Soon we were shooting hoops together and drawing local youngsters into a game . I did n't speak a word of Cantonese , but we pointed and laughed our way through creating teams , and rejigging the lineups when our team lost badly . Playing basketball in the middle of a busy city centre on that beautiful night is my favourite memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are places we largely take for granted . In our early parenting years , we bring our young children there to hang from the monkey bars , crawl through plastic tunnels and spiral in the tire swing . It 's also a place to stay connected through those demanding years of raising little ones , when meeting another parent in the park can be like a life raft in a sea of non-stop interaction with pre-language little people . And as our children get a little older , our parks can serve as places to draw us out of our apartments and houses , connect with the community we live in , experience the joy of kicking a soccer ball with our tweens and sharing a smile with an aging neighbour . When I was growing up in Mississauga , Ont. , the Sunday picnic was an honoured tradition in my family . We 'd go to lakeside Jack Darling Park where the food was secondary to the Frisbee , soccer ball and freeze tag . The afternoon would be spent running , throwing and playing with each other . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found my own - and now that I 'm a parent myself , that love of play still has a valued place in my life . When I share my passion for unstructured play with others , I 'm asked about the role that sport plays in my children 's lives . I am extremely grateful my daughter , Kate , can enjoy synchro and gymnastics , and my son , William , has a passion for basketball . But the three of us are just as happy running around with our dog , Balto , or playing road hockey in the driveway . We need to protect the opportunity to have these special times by not overscheduling our lives . Organized sports can boost kids ' fitness , introduce them to new friends and teach them how to work as a team . But sport alone is not the answer to keeping kids healthy and active . Physiotherapists are starting to see overuse injuries in 10-year-olds , not only because soccer is everything and the only thing these 10year-olds do , but because they 're missing play experiences that build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know play is good for kids : It enhances brain function , coordination and social skills . The physical play of climbing a tree , riding a bike or playing a game of tag recruits multiple muscle groups and develops complex skills that are fundamental in building a healthy body . And the best part of it is that when kids are playing a game of capture the flag or racing to the end of the monkey bars , they are n't thinking about building bones or increasing lung capacity ; they 're having fun . Even later , between nine and 12 , children still need the physical play of riding bikes and bouncing on trampolines to complement the sport they are enjoying . My favourite parks are the ones where we can alternate between a field for impromptu softball games , some rougher terrain that lets the kids get close to nature on a regular basis , and a great playground structure . The latter is getting hard to come by , as many neighbourhoods replace older equipment with dumbed-down structures that would n't challenge any child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one installed in our local park a " baby playground . " It offers so little to inspire the imagination that on our weekly visits there to play with the dog , William and Kate use it for nothing more than to chase each other around . The standard combination of two swings , one slide and one row of monkey bars may be deemed safe , but if the equipment is too easy , children will get bored , and if they are bored they will look for other challenges that ultimately put them at risk . A great playground is designed for both individual and group play , and the equipment should allow kids to spin , rock , balance and climb . The best structures I 've found are made by RecTec Industries ( rectecindustries.com ) in Delta , BC . Far from boring , these colourful structures are relevant and interesting enough to engage children for long periods of time . There are climbing walls and twisty structures you can slide down or climb up , plus a place at the top for imaginary play and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these with the Steve Nash Foundation at Central Park in Victoria , and at any time of day the structure is teeming with kids . If only every community were lucky enough to have a playground like this . But even the best park does n't serve the community if it 's difficult to access . Is the park an easy walk for parents with strollers ? Do kids have to cross busy streets to get there ? I feel comfortable enough with the location of our neighbourhood park to let my kids walk there alone , and I know the retired couple whose house is close to it , so my kids can check in with them if they need help . Sounds like a tall order , but vibrant , accessible parks are worth it for what they contribute to our communities . Great parks are great because of the people who use them . So let 's make sure there are reasons for people young and old and of every ability level - to come out and play .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
