The wind blew with such direct force that the porch swing rode up sideways and wrenched back , overshooting its normal setting several times a minute , and my great-aunt Stacy was worried . She waited for a pause and then rushed to unhook it . The swing fell , and the chain smacked her ankle in its horrible funny-bone place . She hopped inside , sitting down on the threshold to rub it . In the premature dusk that comes with such weather , shadows fell as if with a bang . With so much movement in the air , only substantial items like houses and clouds were throwing shadows , cutouts incongruously still , as if sucked there by vacuums in the earth . <p> There was a lot of suspense . <p> Soon it was actually dusk , then night in which it rained like nuts , then morning . Stacy had stayed in the doorway , but then gone to bed . That 's what she was doing . <p> She did n't tell me the story at any particular time , nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stacy did n't begin to know the plot until later , the next day , when she was told her three-month  --  old baby had been found dead . Two teenage girls a town over had been running around in a field , fools in the rain , and stumbled over the infant where she 'd been buried in a depression so shallow a foot stuck out . The girls pulled the baby from the mud , and ran with it back to the house . The house , which belonged to the family of one of the girls , stood at the edge of the field with its porch light glowing , like a gate to the rest of the world . <p> I do n't know what this has done to the girls . <p> One girl was spending the night with the other-you know that kind of terrific thirteen-year-old night , when you 're so cute you hop out of the bed you 're sharing because it 's a sleepover , out of your fluffy covers and into the rain , flailing your arms with the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll remember how you used to have it any old time it was called for . The field was wide and bumpy , and the girls , carrying the flopping baby , stumbled over clods of earth when before they 'd tumbled like they meant it . In fact , it was the girl who was usually quieter who carried the baby . The other girl dashed ahead and back like a romping dog . She dashed ahead as if looking for a way to dear the way , wishing there were brush and a machete so she could do some good , and dashed back wishing she were taller and could shield them from the rain and the lightning should it strike them like the bumbling targets they 'd become in the field in which they 'd been targets all along , but not felt it . <p> By the time they got to the house , the baby was clean of dirt except for its nostrils . One girl opened the baby 's mouth with her fingers and then said , " Should I pick its nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm scared you 'll push it in further . " This happened on the porch of the house of the noisier girl 's family . <p> I knew the story the way some adopted kids , for instance , never suffer a moment of finding out . They do n't know who told them , but they know , and when it comes up in conversation , their understanding of the details go corroborated or corrected as often or not as those of any memory . Mostly it came up over dinner . So-and-so found out such and such , please pass that , thank you . <p> I also know about the family gathering for the occasion . Stacy says they flocked , so I have imagined my fat and skinny relatives zooming through the sky in V 's like geese with suitcases dangling , and waddling into the living room of the now-suburban farmhouse where Stacy still lives because time passes , cities encroach , and when you 're stuck you 're stuck . The family flies in through bright skies but when they arrive it is still raining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a line by the fire , wringing their hair and dumping water from their hats onto the braided rug . They take turns holding Stacy 's hand , talking on the phone , carrying bowls of hot muffins in from the kitchen . They 're on rotation , and remain as interchangeable as geese , their clothes variations on a theme of wet and luscious in color . This goes on . The relatives swap spots on the furniture and trade duties . Stacy sits on the edge of the blue wingback . Someone sits on the ottoman and holds her hand . They keep passing her hand from hand to hand . <p> Several years later , Stacy is no longer under suspicion , but no one else is , either . Not the girls from the field , or the husband who was out of town , or anyone . Everyone in the flock , at some point , has already been under suspicion , and equally so . While under suspicion , that person 's role shifted , and then the suspicion shifted , and that person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post with reporters , the post in the kitchen , the post with the policeman with the notepad , the post with a neighbor , the post that gets groceries . They devise tasks for one another . They decide to track down the killer . They write letters , they go to scenes of the crime , and scenes that at various times are possibly scenes of an aspect of the crime . They talk to the girls , and the husband , and Stacy , and this leads them to talking to other people . They drive places and talk to people . They tell newspaper reporters that they talked to people . They tell the police . By the time I was born , several of the gaggle were dead , a couple were in jail for tax evasion , the rest were scattered back where they 'd flown in from , and in fact I have met none in any way that makes one more memorable than another . Still , under each person 's breath , whether the breath is in my face , memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice , justice , we want justice , " catchy as the child 's rhyme it has become , and still I have n't caught it . <p> In fact , in my life , I have to think hard for something to add when I 'm gathered with a group of friends , eating and drinking , being unattached adults , and there 's a roundtable about our funny families : " I have a crazy cousin who wraps his fingers with electrical tape because he 's afraid of electrons . " " I have a cousin who got sent home from Europe because she went anorexic . " " I wish I could go to Europe . " <p> I want to join in the conversation , to be one of the girls , and I think , I wish I had a crazy cousin . Then I think , By golly , Aunt Stacy will do . <p> It 's been so long . She keeps writing letters all over the place . It 's become normal . It 's my normal life , this extravagant circumstance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everyone will say she lived a life worth living . If she dies first , they 'll say two lives wasted . And this logic troubles me , when I think of it , because for one thing , it does not sound like justice either way . For another , I am sure I like justice , at its heart . I 'm sure it would be great to have it , for Stacy to have it . I believe , however , that once you have gone through the gate that makes you sure that indeed you , of all people , because of your life , ought to have it , ought to have justice , because someone has buried your baby , and everyone can see that 's no justice-you know for sure , it 's obvious , no justice there with the burying of that baby-at this point , with you knowing you ought to have some , justice spies you from across the plains and shimmies toward you from that great distance and does a taunting schoolyard dance in front of you , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a presence . Stacy goes limp . I go limp . This justice character , I do not like . <p> At my house , you go to the end of the backyard and out a gate . Pine needles cover the forest floor , like magic because all the foliage visible is deciduous , but not magic . Of course , this is because the pine trees reach above the others , and their needles fall from stories high . I remember first figuring this out , as a kid , along a forest path . I 'd thought maybe wind had blown pine needies in from elsewhere , the way some beaches are laden with shells when down a mile or so there are none . I remember when first figuring this out , I was standing in a forest in a little clearing with pine needles , noticing that in my years of futzing around in the forest , this was the first time I had n't felt a residual desire to take a broom and tidy up . I thought , What a great idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift . The pleasure I felt in finding the logic , that the needles came from above the rest of the treeline , was momentary . After that , I felt sad . <p> One time I was on the poetry committee in junior high school , and a kid handed in a poem called " The Mysteries of Life , " and as a main example , he 'd written that no one knows why birds fly in a V. Everyone liked the poem . I said , " But people know why , birds fly in a V , do n't they ? " Then everyone was mad at me , and I understood why . I was mad at myself for a moment-not for having criticized the poem , but for ruining everyone 's surety that they 'd felt moved . Then I got defensive . I said , " Well , jeez , for that matter , I do n't know why I walk upright . " <p> I 've been trained from birth , or at least kindergarten , to track my favorite things . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We picked favorite foods , and colors . We made books about it , with illustrations . Later , schoolkids forced it on each other , and we had to declare our favorite rock bands . We wore T-shirts about it , and collected cutouts from magazines . Along the way we learned to lie . We chose to have the same favorites , for coincidence . Look : we 're both wearing knee socks , we 're alike , we 're twins , we are one , I love you , love me . Or we condescended while pretending to be super-accepting . You like ice cream . Well , I 'm partial to grapefruit myself , I am unique , and I have acquired a taste . Or chocolate , you like chocolate . Well , I like this particular kind of Belgian chocolate we have flown in , what , you do n't know Leonidas ? I do not know when I stopped knowing what my real favorite was . I do know that I continue to tell myself what is my favorite , and that I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being told we might choose created the ability to choose , and that all choices result in a lucky or unlucky lie . Still , it is difficult for me to sustain a sense of pleasure unless , upon feeling pleasure , I assign a favorite to it . You are my favorite person , which is good because you 're licking me there . This is my favorite route to work , which is good , because I took the time to take it . <p> This is my favorite weather : Wind so high in the trees I know it 's there only because I can see it . Down here it is still . I look up , and concentrate . I try to feel the feathered edge of it . Down here it is still . There is a lot of suspense . <p> My great-aunt Stacy is old , weak , and dying . She has written me a letter . She wants me to run an errand , involving driving up the Smoky Mountains and talking to a person there who might have buried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family business , because it does n't and never did make any money . Her letter says it 's about justice . She says it 's about justice for her buried baby and soon it will be justice for her as well . I 'm thinking , What are you saying here , that you have to die to have justice be for you , or are you trying to be self-deprecating to win my resolve ? I 'm thinking , Jeez , Stacy , did n't anyone ever say your baby would want you to move on and have a happy life , or did they say that and you said , " Fuck off , she was just a baby and now she 's dead and she does n't want squat " ? <p> She has drawn me a map . It 's a terrific-looking map , drawn on fibrous paper with a felt tip pen that bleeds a lot . It looks like a treasure map , and I appreciate the map . <p> If I go I could go because I appreciate the map as I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go I could go because she 's not dead yet and I 'm a nice person , and I think I might be her favorite . If I go I could go because something might happen . Something will happen anyway , but if I go something will also happen , but different . <p> One time , at a dinner-party roundtable , one of my nice adult friends asked me what I thought . She remembered from the other dinner-party roundtable that someone had buried that baby in my life . I remembered why I tried not to mention it . I thought , Oh shit , I forgot , and I mentioned it . So all of a sudden I thought , because she asked , and noticed I 'd thought , overall , really , not much . I went through a period of time thinking , when I was thirteen , the age of the girls . When I turned thirteen , I thought , I 'm going through a gate , because I am now the age those girls were , and are to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I was born had , at that point , only just appeared in theirs , years and years before . <p> I looked around the dinner-party roundtable . There were my friends , these grown-un eirls , four of them . One of them I 'd been in love with for a long time , without mentioning it . Another I liked well enough and had sex with when we were both lonely and giddy at the same time . Another was one I thought was the smartest person I 'd ever met who felt like hanging out with me . Another was a great cook and hobbyist . We are all adults . I do not want them to look at me and think of a flopping baby . I do not want them to look at me and suddenly remember that they were n't thinking of a baby flopping around in my past . I hope it surprised those girls later that they did n't think much about the baby , once it was buried again . Every so often , the noisier girl says to the quieter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , Yeah . I hope they do n't picture themselves sparring with a Salome in a schoolyard . I hope they do n't think a couple girls ca n't run around in a field in the rain . <p> I do n't know if I like Stacy . I find myself afraid that at some point , after they were cleared of suspicion , Stacy called the girls on the telephone and asked them for details so she could follow up . I do n't know if there is anything to like about Stacy , unless you agree with her about justice , which I do n't . In fact , I think agreeing with Stacy about justice is a bit of grabbing for straws . You could like grabbing for straws . I think Stacy must like grabbing for straws , and just keeps getting short ones . I think I would prefer a roll in the hay , but the whole thing makes me giddy . Perhaps what you ca n't resist is all right . I like Stacy all right . <p> Where is the husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Aunt Stacy was unhooking the swing in the wind and nursing her ankle ? <p> The husband was out west , visiting family , when the baby was found . He flew back with the rest of them , but he would n't go into the house . He stayed in a motel for a while . He and Stacy had a big fight about it . She wanted him to go back into the house , but he did n't want to go into the house . He said , " Stacy , you can not make me go into that house . " He said it was his baby , too . He bought a house out west and went there . <p> After the girls found the baby , they knelt with it on the threshold with the door open , to let out the light , and looked at its nose and mouth . One time , a policeman asked each girl why they did n't bring the baby inside , immediately . The noisy girl said , " You do n't know . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were afraid to bring it into the house . " What she meant was they brought the baby out of the rain and into the light , and there was light on the porch where they could see , and it did n't matter whether they were inside or outside the house , that it was a question about arbitrary boundaries he was asking and you do n't think about , for God 's sake , architecture at a time like that . But the policeman thought maybe something was scary about the noisy girls ' parents , so he investigated them to find out about possible abuse . <p> II went to Aunt Stacy 's house with the map she sent me . I sat on the sofa , next to the blue wingback chair . I held the map in my hand , and Stacy held my hand with the map in it and pointed to the map with her other hand . She said , Please go there , then there , then there . Call me from there , if they have a phone . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she looks at me , I 'm burying the baby . When she looks at me , I 'm the baby , buried . <p> I went back to my house , which was a good long drive . You never know how it feels until it happens to you , and then if it happens to you , you still have no idea if you know how it felt to anyone else . At that point , you 're pretty busy anyway . And later , you do n't remember so well . You feel what you are feeling now . I do n't know what it is . <p> When I got home , I opened the back door , which divides my kitchen from the path that leads to the woods . I set about washing some dishes . I got partway through , and then I took a bath . I 've got a lousy , shallow tub , and while I was soaking , I thought about how a bathtub ought to be designed . It ought to be adjustable like a lawn chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It ought to have a faucet you can easily operate with your foot . It ought not be shaped like a trough . I 'd stopped washing my dishes because a moth flew out of my cupboard , and it turns out moths were making babies in my beans . I dumped the beans in the trash can outside , and then I got into the tub . When I got out of the tub , I stood in my kitchen in my bathrobe , and watched a bird that had flown in . Usually , earlier in the season perhaps , when a bird comes in it flaps around in a panic , and usually ends up really hurting itself . But with this bird , I had the sense it was attempting to migrate , that my house was simply , for the moment , in the way of the south , because it flew in , perched on a shelf , a plant , the dish rack , and then flew out , decent and calm as a bird can be . There was no drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen only when I think of the baby , and when I think of the baby , I 'm stuck at thirteen . It 's not right , because there 's a lot more to me , I 'm sure . In any case , the suspense is killing me . <p> Go to the mountain . There 's a sagging cabin with its mortar falling out in chunks . In it live some people . They 're up in the mountain , making a living . Ask at the door , Did you make a call from a pay phone on this date ? Do you remember a man wearing yellow boots ? Were you eating cole slaw at the diner ? Did you tell this woman you were in a hurry ? Do you or did you ever own a parakeet ? Did this tumble from your pocket ? Did you break this omelet pan ? Have you traveled to Ecuador ? And what about your family ? And what about your friends ? Have you buried a baby ? Did you bury this baby ? <p> I dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the covers there is heat and air . As I was falling asleep , one of my friends called , and it could have been any one of them , they are all so fine and lovely . I spoke with her on the phone , bringing the phone with me under the covers . I told her about the bird in my kitchen , and then about this one time in junior high when we did a Christmas show at a nursing home . We made reindeer horns out of coat hangers and our fathers ' socks . We sang and gave out peppermints . We used the peppermints as the reason to go up to the old people and say , " Merry Christmas , how 'd you like the show ? " <p> I thought , Who told us to do that ? Who said give peppermints to people with dentures ? Who said do role reversal on the candy dish on Gramma 's coffee table ? Who said bad singing is good singing if it 's volunteer ? I gave a peppermint to a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spat great translucent globes of mucus that fell , like action heroes , in slow motion . I said , " Merry Christmas , how 'd you like the show ? " and she said , " It was stupid , " and I regret with might the indignation I felt , and how such simplicity stumped me . <p> We talked for hours , and I did n't have to tell her how what I meant about the peppermints was I think you lose more if you lose so much you start living for the sake of convention . Instead , I told her all sorts of things , dumb little things that happened one time , and dumb little things I was thinking about now and then . We swapped off . I told her something and then she told me something back . We were on the phone for enough time that I got unsleepy and then sleepy again several times . She said , " I 'm so sleepy , " and I said , " But now I 'm awake , " and I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But now I 'm awake . ' Finally , we were both sleepy at the same moment , and I hardly remember most of what we talked about , which is much of why it felt so lovely . There was some justice , I thought , later . A sweet , naked little bully , with scarves around her feet . <p> Author Affiliation
