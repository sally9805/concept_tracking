Ahmad Chalabi likes to sleep in . He does his work at night , engaging in endless back-room meetings and talk sessions that often drag on past midnight . On most days he rises late and eats breakfast alone  --  but last Thursday his wake-up call came early . At 10 a.m. , five armored humvees pulled up outside Chalabi 's two-story house in west Baghdad . While U.S. soldiers cordoned off the street , seven Iraqi police officers broke down the front door and stormed the living room . <P> Chalabi stumbled downstairs to find cops rummaging through his effects and preparing to arrest one of his drivers . " What are you doing here ? " he said . " Get out of my house . " Upon recognizing Chalabi , a police captain put down his gun and produced arrest warrants for seven of Chalabi 's lieutenants . The captain insisted that the raid was n't at his instigation . " He had no idea whose house it was , " says Haider Musawi , an aide to Chalabi . " He said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who four months ago could still boast of Oval Office privileges , being targeted in his own home by his former patrons was stunning enough . But he could do nothing to stop what happened next . An hour and a half after the police finished searching Chalabi 's house , a second contingent of cops burst into a compound several blocks away  --  an ornate mansion known as China House , which serves as the headquarters of Chalabi 's Iraqi National Congress ( I.N.C. ) . The Iraqis pointed guns at Chalabi 's guards and ordered them to load the police vehicles with the office 's computers , documents and files . Outside , a group of Americans dressed in civilian clothes watched with approval while smoking Cuban cigars and drinking sodas taken from Chalabi 's office fridge . An I.N.C. official tells TIME the Americans identified themselves as FBI and CIA but refused to show identification . " The Americans were sitting there , egging on the Iraqis , " says the official . " They sat on the veranda saying things like ' Good job , keep at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seizing weapons , ripping down pictures of Chalabi 's father , even confiscating a copy of the Koran . An Iraqi officer smashed a framed photograph of the Pentagon 's favorite exile himself . " Chalabi is finished , " he said .
