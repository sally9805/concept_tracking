SantaLand Diaries <p> I was in a coffee shop looking through the want ads when I read , " Macy 's Herald Square , the largest store in the world , has big opportunities for outgoing , fun-loving people of all shapes and sizes who want more than just a holiday job ! Working as an elf in Macy 's SantaLand means being at the center of the excitement .... " <p> I circled the as and then I laughed out loud at the thought of it . The man seated next to me turned on his stool , checking to see if I was a lunatic . I continued to laugh , quietly . Yesterday I applied for a job at UPS . They are hiring drivers ' helpers for the upcoming Christmas season and I went to their headquarters filled with hope . In line with three hundred other men and women my hope diminished . During the brief interview I was asked why I wanted to work for UPS and I answered that I wanted to work for UPS because I like the brown uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd like to work for UPS because , in my opinion , it 's an opportunity to showcase my substantial leadership skills in one of the finest private delivery companies this country has seen since the Pony Express ! " <p> I said I liked the uniforms and the UPS interviewer turned my application facedown on his desk and said , " Give me a break . " <p> I came home this afternoon and checked the machine for a message from UPS but the only message I got was from the company that holds my student loan , Sallie Mae . Sallie Mae sounds like a naive and barefoot hillbilly girl but in fact they are a ruthless and aggressive conglomeration of bullies located in a tall brick building somewhere in Kansas . I picture it to be the tallest building in that state and I have decided they hire their employees straight out of prison . It scares me . <p> The woman at Macy 's asked , " Would you be interested in full-time elf or evening and weekend elf ? " <p> I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Wednesday at noon . <p> I am a thirty-three-year-old man applying for a job as an elf . <p> I often see people on the streets dressed as objects and handing out leaflets . I tend to avoid leaflets but it breaks my heart to see a grown man dressed as a taco . So , if there is a costume involved , I tend not only to accept the leaflet , but to accept it graciously , saying , " Thank you so much , " and thinking , You poor , pathetic son of a bitch . I do n't know what you have but I hope I never catch it . This afternoon on Lexington Avenue I accepted a leaflet from a man dressed as a camcorder . Hot dogs , peanuts , tacos , video cameras , these things make me sad because they do n't fit in on the streets . In a parade , maybe , but not on the streets . I figure that at least as an elf I will have a place ; I 'll be in Santa 's Village with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluffy wonderland surrounded by candy canes and gingerbread shacks . It wo n't be quite as sad as standing on some street corner dressed as a french fry . <p> I am trying to look on the bright side . I arrived in New York three weeks ago with high hopes , hopes that have been challenged . In my imagination I 'd go straight from Penn Station to the offices of " One Life to live , " where I would drop off my bags and spruce up before heading off for drinks with Cord Roberts and Victoria Buchannon , the show 's greatest stars . We 'd sit in a plush booth at a tony cocktail lounge where my new celebrity friends would lift their frosty glasses in my direction and say , " A toast to David Sedaris , the best writer this show has ever had ! ! ! " <p> I 'd say , " You guys , cut it out . " It was my plan to act modest . <p> People at surrounding tables would stare at us , whispering , " Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might be distracted by their enthusiasm and Victoria Buchannon would lay her hand over mine and tell me that I 'd better get used to being the center of attention . <p> But instead I am applying for a job as an elf . Even worse than applying is the very real possibility that I will not be hired , that I could n't even find work as an elf . That 's when you know you 're a failure . <p> This afternoon I sat in the eighth-floor SantaLand office and was told , " Congratulations , Mr. Sedaris . You are an elf . " <p> In order to become an elf I filled out ten pages ' worth of forms , took a multiple choice personality test , underwent two interviews , and submitted urine for a drug test . The first interview was general , designed to eliminate the obvious sociopaths . During the second interview we were asked when we wanted to be elves . This is always a problem question . I listened as the woman ahead of me , a former waitress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an elf ? Because I think it 's about acting ? And before this I worked in a restaurant ? Which was run by this rally wonderful woman who had a dream to open a restaurant ? And it made me realize that it 's really really ... important to have a ... dream ? " <p> Everything this woman said , every phrase and sentence , was punctuated with a question mark and the interviewer never raised an eyebrow . <p> When it was my turn I explained that I wanted to be an elf because it was one of the most frightening career opportunities I had ever come across . The interviewer raised her face from my application and said , " And ... ? " <p> I 'm certain that I failed my drug test . My urine had roaches and stem floating in it , but still they hired me because I am short , five feet five inches . Almost everyone they hired is short . One is a dwarf . After the second interview I was brought to the manager 's office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy day twenty-two thousand people come to visit Santa , and I was told that it is an elf 's not to remain merry in the face of torment and adversity . I promised to keep that in mind . <p> I spent my eight-hour day with fifty elves and one perky , well-meaning instructor in an enormous Macy 's classroom , the walls of which were lined with NCR 2152 's . A 2152 , I have come to understand , is a cash register . The class was broken up into study groups and given assignments . My group included several returning elves and a few experienced cashiers who tried helping me by saying things like , " Do n't you even know your personal ID code ? Jesus , I had mine memorized by ten o'clock . " <p> Everything about the cash register intimidates me . Each procedure involves a series of codes : separate numbers for cash , checks , and each type of credit card . The term Void has gained prominence as the filthiest four-letter word in my vocabulary . Voids are a nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and initialed by the employee and his supervisor . <p> Leaving the building tonight I could not shake the mental picture of myself being stoned to death by restless , angry customers , their nerves shattered by my complete lack of skill . I tell myself that I will simply pry open my register and accept anything they want to give me-beads , cash , watches , whatever . I 'll negotiate and swap . I 'll stomp their credit cards through the masher , write " Nice Knowing You ! " along the bottom of the slip , and leave it at that . <p> All we sell in SantaLand are photos . People sit upon Santa 's lap and pose for a picture . The Photo Elf hands them a slip of paper with a number printed along the top . The form is filled out by another elf and the picture arrives by mail weeks later . So really , all we sell is the idea of a picture . One idea costs nine dollars , three ideas cost eighteen . <p> My worst nightmare involves twenty-two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always be a cashier , just once in a while . The worst part is that after I have accumulated three hundred dollars I have to remove two hundred , fill out half a dozen forms , and run the envelope of cash to the drop in the China Department or to the vault on the balcony above the first floor . I am not allowed to change my clothes beforehand . I have to go dressed as an elf . An elf in SantaLand is one thing , an elf in Sportswear is something else altogether . <p> This afternoon we were given presentations and speeches in a windowless conference room crowded with desks and plastic chairs . We were told that during the second week of December , SnataLand is host to " Operation Special Children , " at which time poor children receive free gifts donated by the store . There is another morning set aside for terribly sick and deformed children . On that day it is an elf 's job to greet the child at the Magic Tree and jog back to the house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing a nose , " or " Crystal has third-degree burns covering 90 percent of her body . " <p> Missing a nose . With these children Santa has to be careful not to ask , " And what would you like for Christmas ? " <p> We were given a lecture by the chief of security , who told us that Macy 's Herald Square suffers millions of dollars ' worth of employee theft per year . As a result the store treats its employees the way one might treat a felon with a long criminal record . Cash rewards are offered for turning people in and our bags are searched every time we leave the store . We were shown videotapes in which supposed former employees hang their head and rue the day they ever thought to steal that leather jacket . The actors faced the camera to explain how their arrests had ruined their friendships , family life , and , ultimately , their future . <p> One fellow stared at his hands and sighed , " There 's no way I 'm going to be admitted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done . Nope , no way . " He paused and shook his head of the unpleasant memory . " Oh , man , not after this . No way . " <p> A lonely , reflective girl sat in a coffee shop , considered her empty cup , and moaned , " I remember going out after work with all my Macy 's friends . God , those were good times . I loved those people . " She stared off into space for a few moments before continuing , " Well , needless to say , those friends are n't calling anymore . This time I 've really messed up . Why did I do it ? Why ? " <p> Macy 's has two jail cells on the balcony floor and it apprehends three thousand shoplifters a year . We were told to keep an eye out for pickpockets in SantaLand . <p> Interpreters for the deaf came and taught us to sign , " MERRY CHRISTMAS ! I AM SANTA 'S HELPER . " They told us to speak as we sign and to use bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to say , " YOU ARE A VERY PRETTY BOY/GIRL ! I LOVE YOU ! DO YOU WANT A SURPRISE ? " <p> My sister Amy lives above a deaf girl and has learned quite a bit of sign language . She taught some to me and so now I am able to say , " SANTA HAS A TUMOR IN HIS HEAD THE SIZE OF AN OLIVE . MAYBE IT WILL GO AWAY TOMORROW BUT I DO N'T THINK SO . " <p> This morning we were lectured by the SantaLand managers and presented with a Xeroxed booklet of regulations titled " The Elfin Guide . " Most of the managers are former elves who have worked their way up the candy-cane ladder but retain vivid memories of their days in uniform . They closed the meeting saying , " I want you to remember that even if you are assigned Photo Elf on a busy weekend , YOU ARE NOT SANTA 'S SLAVE . " <p> In the afternoon we were given a tour of SantaLand , which really is something . It 's beautiful , a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , train sets , bridges , decorated trees , mechanical penguins and bears , and really tall candy canes . One enters and travels through a maze , a path which takes you from one festive environment to another . The path ends at the Magic Tree . The Tree is supposed to resemble a complex system of roots , but looks instead like a scale model of the human intestinal tract . Once you pass the Magic Tree , the light dims and an elf guides you to Santa 's house . The houses are cozy and intimate , laden with toys . You exit Santa 's house and are met with a line of cash registers . <p> We traveled the path a second time and were given the code names for various post , such as " The Vomit Corner , " a mirrored wall near the Magic Tree , where nauseous children tend to surrender the contents of their stomachs . When someone Vomits , the nearest elf is supposed to yell " VAMOOSE , " which is the name of the janitorial product used by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My God , Corner , " a position near the escalator . People arriving see the long line and say " Oh , my God ! " and it is an elf 's job to calm them down and explain that it will take no longer than an hour to see Santa . <p> On any given day you can be an Entrance Elf , a Water Cooler Elf , a Bridge Elf , Train Elf , Maze Elf , Island Elf , Magic Window Elf , Emergency Exit Elf , Counter Elf , Magic Tree Elf , Pointer Elf , Santa Elf , Photo Elf , Usher Elf , Cash Register Elf , Runner Elf , or Exit Elf . We were given a demonstration of the various positions in action , performed by returning elves who were so animated and relentlessly cheerful that it embarrassed me to walk past them . I do n't know that I could look someone in the eye and exclaim , " Oh , my goodness , I think I see Santa ! " or " Can you close your eyes and make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an exclamation point at the end of it ! ! ! It makes one 's mouth hurt to speak with such forced merriment . I feel cornered when someone talks to me this way . Does n't everyone ? I prefer being frank with children . I 'm more likely to say , " You must be exhausted , " or " I know a lot of people who would kill for that little waistline of your . " <p> I am afraid I wo n't be able to provide the grinding enthusiasm Santa is asking for . I think I 'll be a low-key sort of an elf . <p> Today was elf dress rehearsal . The lockers and dressing rooms are located on the eight floor , directly behind SantaLand . Elves have gotten to know one another over the past four days of training but one we took off our clothes and put on the uniforms everything changed . <p> The woman in charge of costuming assigned us our outfits and gave us a lecture on keeping things clean . She held up a calendar and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use it . I have scraped enough blood out from the crotches of elf knickers to last me the rest of my life . And do n't tell me , I do n't wear underpants , I 'm a dancer . ' You 're not a dancer . If you were a real dancer you would n't be here . You 're an elf and you 're going to wear panties like an elf . " <p> My costume is green . I wear green velvet knickers , a yellow turtleneck , a forest-green velvet smock , and a perky stocking cap decorated with spangles . This is my work uniform . <p> My elf name is Crumpet . We were allowed to choose our own names and given permission to change them according to out outlook on the snowy world . <p> Today was the official opening day of SantaLand and I worked as a Magic Window Elf , a Santa Elf , and an Usher Elf . The Magic Window is located in the adult " Quick Peep " line . My job was to say , " Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can see Santa ! " I was at the Magic Window for fifteen minutes before a man approached me and said , " You look so fucking stupid . " <p> I have to admit that he had a point . But still , I wanted to say that at least I get paid to look stupid , that he gives it away for free . But I ca n't say things like that because I 'm supposed to be merry . <p> So instead I said , " Thank you ! " <p> " Thank you ! " as if I had misunderstood and thought he had said , " You look terrific . " <p> " Thank you ! " <p> He was a brawny wise guy wearing a vinyl jacket and carrying a bag from Radio Shack . I should have said , real loud , " Sorry , man , I do n't date other guys . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
