What 's the best way to learn about dolphins ? A. Stock up on old Flipper reruns , or B. Get your feet wet . If you answered B , an exciting sci= ence career in underwater research might be right for you . Just ask marine biologist Kathleen Dudzinski , who has dived headfirst into the study of dolphins in the wild . Kathleen has filmed and recorded wild dolphins in the tropical waters around the Bahama Islands and the colder waters off southern South America . She wants to know how these intelligent mammals communicate and relate to each other in their natural environment . And she 's already making interesting discoveries ; for instance , did you know that young spotted dolphins are noisier than adults ? Using a. device called a mobilevideo-acoustic array ( MVA ) ; which she designed with the help of some associates , Kathleen has spent hundreds of hours swimming with the dolphins , watching their behavior and capturing the chirps , squeaks , clicks , and other noises they make . Photograph Photograph // Creating a film and audio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make careful notes about what dolphin actions seem to go with what noises . Here are some dolphin behaviors that Kathleen has identified : Resting of a pectoral fin against the side of another dolphin can be a signal of friendship , or possibly that the first dolphin wants a favor from the second . Direct head-on approaches , or fast approaches straight in from the side , often indicate aggression . Approaches from behind or at oblique angles seem less threatening . Mutual pectoral fin rubs might be a sort of greeting , almost like a handshake . Slowly and carefully , Kathleen is building a record that someday might explain how dolphins communicate in their natural environment . And understanding dolphin communication would be a big stop toward learning how smart these creatures really are . Kathleen first learned that she loved the ocean when she was only five , on family vacations to the shore . After that it was just a matter of time before her love of science and the sea came together . As a college junior she volunteered to help a group studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammals like whales and dolphins . She learned that she loved this kind of study , but she also learned about the hard daily work of science , the observing , recording , and evaluating of evidence . She encourages kids who are interested in science to get a through grounding while they are young . That will give them the background they 'll need to build on later . " The advice I 'd offer to kids is to find places ( like aquaria ; science museums , zoos , etc. ) that they can volunteer at-through direct experience they will determine if they truly do want a career in the sciences , " she said . " The kids should find out what they are passionate about , what they like to do , and follow up on that . " Two recent projects might help whet Kids ' appetites for science . Kathleen is appearing now in the large-screen IMAX film Dolphins presently making the rounds of museums and big-screen theaters around the country . And her book for kids , Meeting Dolphins ; is available now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to see what the science of dolphin study is really like . Photograph // <p>
