WARILY , EDWARD TOLD Margaret his fantasy . <p> It 's Joe Louis Arena in late August , peak allergy season . He 's in the ring with foe Louis himself , and as Edward dances around the canvas his sinuses feel like impacted masonry . Pollen floats in the air , his eyes are watering , and everything beyond the ring is a blur . Joe Louis is looking strong : smooth glistening chest , fierce gaze , arms pumping like oil rigs . Edward wipes his nose on his glove and shuffles forward . Joe studies him , waiting , drops his guard a few inches . Edward sees his opening and swings , a sweeping roundhouse . Joe sidesteps easily and the blow misses completely . Edward is stumbling forward , off balance and wide open . He looks up as Joe Louis 's fist crashes into his face - but it 's not Joe 's normal fist , it 's the giant Joe Louis Fist sculpture that hangs from chains in the Detroit Plaza , and it 's swinging down , down . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his zygomatic lobe like a nut . Sinus fluid runs like hot syrup down his chest and over his silk boxing shorts . <p> " That 's what I like to think about the most , " Edward told her . " That hot liquid draining . " <p> His wife stared at him . " I do n't think I can take this much longer , " she said . <p> The address led them to an austere brick building in an aging industrial park . <p> " It does n't look like a massage parlor , " Edward said . <p> " It 's a clinic , " Margaret said . " For massage therapy . " <p> Edward could feel a sneeze gearing up behind the bridge of his nose . He pulled a few tissues from the Kleenex box on the dash , reconsidered , and took the whole box . " I do n't think this is going to help , " he said . It was the first line in an argument they 'd performed several times in the past week . Margaret only looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his four-year-old son laughed . <p> Edward lightly kissed Margaret on the cheek , then reached over the seat to shake hands with Michael . " Be a soldier , " Edward said , and Michael nodded . The boy 's nose was running , and Edward handed him a tissue . <p> Margaret put the car in gear . " I 'll pick you up in an hour . Good luck . " <p> " Good luck ! " Michael yelled . Edward wished they did n't sound so desperate . <p> The waiting room was cedar-paneled and heavy with cinnamon incense ( heavy , he knew , because he could smell it ) . There was a reception desk , but no receptionist , so he sat on the edge of a wicker couch in the position he assumed when waiting - for allergists ; endocrinologiste ; eye , ear , nose , and throat specialists - his left hand holding the wad of Kleenex , his right thumb pressed up against the ridge of bone above his right eye , as if he were working up the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wad , blew into it , switched the moist clump to his other hand , and wedged his other thumb against the left eye . It was all very tedious . <p> A chubby white woman in a sari skittered up to him and held out her hand . " You 're Ed ! " she said in a perky whisper . " How are you ? " <p> He smoothly tucked the Kleenex under his thigh , and as he lifted his hand he ran his palm against the side of his pants , a combination hide-andclean move he 'd perfected over the years . " Just fine , thanks . " <p> " Would you like some tea ? " she asked . " There are some cups over there you can use . " <p> She gestured toward the reception desk where a mahogany tree of ceramic mugs sat next to an electric teapot . What he wanted , he thought , was a syringe to force a pint of steaming Earl Grey up his nose ; what he wanted was a nasal enema . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him that the therapist would be available in a moment , would he like to walk this way , please ? he followed her down a cedar-paneled hallway , tinny sitar music hovering overhead , and she left him in a dim room with a massage table , wicker chair , and a row of cabinets . A dozen plants hung darkly along the edges of the room , suspended by macrame chains . <p> He looked around , wondering if he should take off his clothes . His wife had read him articles about reflexology , but he could n't remember if nakedness was one of the requirements . Once she 'd shown him a diagram in Cosmopolitan : " Everything corresponds to something else , like in voodoo , " Margaret had said . " You press one spot in the middle of your foot , and that 's your kidney . Or you press here , and those are your lungs . And look , Hon. " She pointed at the toes in the illustration . " The tops of the four little toes are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes , what would those correspond to , but something interrupted - tea kettle or telephone - and she never answered . <p> He sat on the table rather than the chair because it was what he did in most examination rooms . When the door opened he was in the middle of blowing his nose . The masseuse was short , with frizzy brown hair . She waited politely until he was finished , and then said , " Hello , Edward . I 'm Annit . " Annit ? Her accent was British or Australian , which somehow reassured him ; foreigners always seemed more knowledgeable than Americans . <p> " Hi , " he said . Her hand was very warm when they shook . <p> " You have a cold ? " she asked sympathetically . <p> " No , no . " He touched the bridge of his nose . " Allergies . " <p> " Ah . " She stared at the place where he 'd touched . The pupils of her eyes were wet black , like beach pebbles . <p> " Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally . <p> She nodded . " Have you seen a doctor ? " Obvious questions normally annoyed him , but her sincerity was disarming . The accent , probably . <p> " I 've seen everyone , " he said . " Every specialist my insurance would cover , and a few that I paid for myself . I 've taken every kind of pill that I 'm not allergic to . " He chuckled to show he was a good sport . <p> " What are you allergic to ? " <p> He paused a moment to blow into a tissue . " They do n't know , really . So far I seem to be allergic to nothing in specific and everything in general . " She stared at his nose . " Allergies are cumulative , see ? Some people are allergic to cats and , say , carpet mites . But if there 's carpet mites but no cat around , they are n't bothered . Cat plus carpet mites , they sneeze . Or six cats , they sneeze . They have n't come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I sneeze at everything . " <p> " For you , " she said , " it 's like there are six cats around all the time ? " <p> " Six hundred cats . " <p> " Oh ! " She looked genuinely concerned . She jotted something on the clipboard in her hand . " I have to ask a few other questions . Do you have any back injuries ? " He shook his head . " Arthritis ? Toothaches , diabetes , emphysema , heart disease ? Ulcers , tumors , or other growths ? Migraines ? " <p> " Yes ! Well , headaches , anyway . Sinus-related . " <p> She made a mark on the clipboard ! " Anything else you think you should tell me ? " <p> He paused . Should he tell her about the toe ? " No , " he said . <p> " Okay , then . I think I can help you . " She set down the clipboard and took his hand . In the poor light her eyes seemed coal black . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work today . Do you know what the key is to therapeutic success ? " She pronounced it " sucsase . " <p> He shook his head . She was hard to follow , but he loved listening to her . <p> " Trust , Edward . " She squeezed his hand . " The client-therapist relationship is based on trust . We 'll have to work together if we 're going to effect change . Do you want to change , Edward ? " <p> He cleared his throat and nodded . " Yes . Of course . " <p> " Then you can . But . Only if we trust each other . Do you understand ? " All that eye contact . <p> " I understand . " <p> " Okay , Edward , " she said briskly . " Get undressed and get under the sheet . I 'll be back in a few minutes . " <p> He quickly removed his clothes and left them folded on the floor . Should he lie face up or down ? Did she tell him ? Down seemed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally got it to cover him . Then he set his face into the padded doughnut and exhaled . <p> Okay now , he thought . Just relax . <p> Almost immediately , the tip of his nose began to itch and burn . A hot dollop of snot eased out of his left nostril . <p> He 'd left his Kleenex with his clothes . <p> He scrambled out of the bed , grabbed the box , and got back under the sheet . Ah , facial tissue , his addiction . Like a good junkie , he always knew exactly how much product was in the room and where it was located . While making love he kept a box near the bed . He preferred entering Margaret from behind because it kept his sinuses upright and let him sneak tissues unseen . <p> Edward propped himself on his elbows and blew , squeezed the other nostril shut and blew again . He looked around for a place to toss the tissue . At work he had two plastic trash bins : a public one out in the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk to hold the used Kleenex . But he did n't see a trash can anywhere in the room . Was it hidden in the cabinets ? <p> A knock at the door . Edward pitched the tissue toward his clothes and put his head back in the doughnut . " Okay ! " he called casually . He tried to arrange his arms into what he hoped looked . " Feel free to grunt and make noises , " she said . <p> " What 's that ? " <p> She peeled back half of the sheet and cool air rippled across his skin . " Make noises , " she said . " I like feedback . " He heard a liquid fart as she squirted something from a bottle , and then felt her oiled hands press into the muscles around his neck . <p> Well , that felt good . Should he tell her now , or wait until it got even better ? And what feedback noises were appropriate ? <p> Ropes began to unkink in his back . She used long , deep strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pressed an elbow into the muscle that ran along his spine ; at first it felt like she was using a steel rod , but after thirty seconds of constant pressure something unclenched inside him and the whole muscle expanded , softened . " You work at a computer ? " she asked . <p> It took him a moment to realize it was a question , a moment more to remember how to answer . " Uh-huh , " he said . His mind had gone liquid . Grunt to give feedback , he thought . <p> Annit was strong for being so small . She finished his back , then rearranged the sheet to do his legs . The top half of him was loose as a fish , but from lower back to his feet he was aching with tightness . How could he not have noticed this before now ? When a long stroke reached to his buttock he felt the first twinge of an erection , but then she pressed her thumbs between the muscles of his legs and he could think of nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time became slippery . He might have fallen asleep if it were n't for the persistent tightness in his forehead and eyes . Still blocked . It 's what Margaret would ask as she watched him honk into a Kleenex : Still blocked ? Still . Always . Margaret would circulate the house , emitting little disgusted sounds as she plucked hardened clumps of tissue from the kitchen table , from between the cushions of the couch , from inside his forgotten coffee cups . " Why do n't you take another pill ? " she would ask , irritated . But Margaret was a free-breather and could not understand . Antihistamines clamped down on his nasal passages , setting up killer headaches . Pseudoephedrine only made his nose drip incessantly without ever coming close to draining his constantly refilling reservoirs of snot . " Here , Daddy , " Michael would say , and hand him a tissue . <p> Annit touched his neck . " Okay , Edward , " she said very quietly . " Let 's turn over . " <p> She held up the sheet between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto his side and had to stop himself from rolling right off the table . He shuffled his body over and Annit let the sheet settle over him like a parachute . <p> His nose was full and a sneeze was growing . " Could I .... " He looked for the Kleenex box . " Do you have a ... ? " <p> She opened a cabinet door and steam drifted out . She handed him a warm , moist , cotton hand-towel . <p> " Oh no , " he said , appalled . " I could n't . " He talked from the back of his throat , trying to hold back the sneeze . <p> " This is part of the therapy , Edward . You must use the towel . No harsh paper . " She smiled and touched the back of his wrist , prompting him to lift the towel to his face . He could n't hold back any longer : he sneezed explosively . And again . And again . <p> Weakly he wiped the tip of his nose , his upper lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the warm cloth felt wonderful . <p> Annit whisked it away from him and he leaned back into the table and closed his eyes . His nasal passages refilled like ballast tanks , but at least the sneezing fit was over . <p> Long moments later Annit lifted his ankles and set them onto a pillow . She oiled his feet , working the surface tissue with firm strokes . A groan of pleasure escaped him . She had a gift . She understood his body . She knew its hidden pockets of tension , and one by one she 'd burst them all . <p> She seemed to change her grip , and he felt a sharp prick , obviously accomplished with a metal instrument . He tensed his body , but said nothing . She stabbed him again and he nearly yelped . <p> With some effort he lifted his head and looked down the landscape of his body . Annit 's hands were empty . " What 's that you 're doing ? " he asked . Trying to sound mildly curious . <p> " Reflexology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your wife said you wanted to try this . " <p> " Oh . " The voodoo thing . He let his head fall back against the table and thought , maybe she wo n't notice the toe . <p> With thumb and forefinger she held his right foot just below his ankle in a delicate grip that burned like sharpened forceps. he sucked air and waited for her to release . <p> " So , " he said casually , his voice tight . " What points do those correspond to ? " <p> " The penis and the prostate . " <p> " Ah , " he said , as if he 'd guessed as much . She continued to hold the foot . My God , he thought , my balls are on fire . After a time she shifted to his other foot , and in the three-second gap between feet a chill coursed up his spine and he thought , hey , that 's good . <p> " You have six toes on your left foot , " she said . " That 's wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he should make a joke , ask about correspondences , but was too embarrassed to speak . Margaret disliked the extra toe , barely acknowledged its existence . She only mentioned it in public once , obliquely , in the delivery room ; she looked down at Michael 's perfectly numbered digits and said , " Thank goodness he has my feet . " <p> Annit worked the tips of his toes , the areas the Cosmo article had linked to sinuses . Her fingers were like needles but he began to anticipate the pain and move into it . Grunt for feedback . <p> Annit 's voice drifted up from the other end of the table . " Do you trust me , Edward ? " <p> Her finger punctured his small toe like a fondue fork . <p> " Ugh . " <p> Time slipped away again . He thought about Annit 's carbon-black eyes , her earnest , non-American voice : The key to therapeutic sucsase is trust . He should have told her about his daydream , about Joe Louis . <p> Grunt to give feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massaged his cheekbones . " Urrm , " he said , a little hesitantly . She hooked her fingers into the ridges above his eye sockets , three fingers to each socket , and pulled back . Bones creaked and he sighed . She pressed her palms to each temple and squeezed ; he hissed . She wedged her thumbs against his nose and pushed east , south , west , north . <p> " Okay , Edward , " Annit said , a little out of breath . " How are those sinuses ? " <p> He tried to inhale through his nose : A wall . He tried to exhale and the air was forced out his mouth . " Still blocked , " he said . Despair almost choked him . He could not move . <p> Annit cursed softly in another language . She touched his face and he closed his eyes again . " Trust me , Edward . Trust me . Lie here for a second . " <p> Still blocked . Always . And the sins of the father would be passed on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the woods Michael 's eyes would water . Dusty rooms made him sneeze like his old man . " Why could n't he get my genes ? " Margaret would say . It would have been better for the boy if he had . But a part of Edward felt ... not proud , not satisfied ... validated perhaps . Here was proof of lineage , distinctive as a hideous birthmark . There was something comforting in the fact that no matter how much their lives diverged - no matter if Michael grew up to be an astronaut or a drag queen - they would always share this . They would always have something to talk about . <p> The smell of incense was stronger . Edward opened one eye . Annit was lighting a candle on the floor a few feet beyond the table . Other candles were lit ; little flames lined the walls . <p> " Is n't this a bit - " He swallowed . His mouth was dry . " A bit dangerous ? " <p> Annit looked at him . Her face was painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a moment to realize that she was also naked . She held up what looked like a celery stick . " Put this in your mouth , " she said . <p> He opened his mouth and she wedged it in crosswise . He carefully touched it with his tongue ; it tasted like bark . Annit stepped behind him . She began to chant in what sounded like B-movie American Indian : lots of vowels and grunts . Moments later her voice was joined by a loud moaning sound ; when she danced into his peripheral vision he could see the stick on a rope whirling above her head . He 'd seen that thing on the Discovery Channel . A ... bulhoarer - that was it . Remembering the name reassured him . He closed his eyes again . <p> The chanting and roaring went on for some time . It was soothing , actually , in the monotonous way that a chorus of washing machines made him sleepy in laundromats . Grunt for feedback , she 'd said . Edward hummed along with the bullroarer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice broke off and the bullroarer wound down until it clattered suddenly against the floor . He heard the chubby girl 's voice , and Annit answering in a whisper , " I need more time . " <p> " But his wife - " <p> " To hell with the wife . I 've got a class-five chakra imbalance here . " The door closed . There was the distinctive clack of a safety bolt sliding home . <p> He felt Annit 's hand under his chin , and then she pulled the stick from his mouth . <p> He blinked up at her . " What was that you were doing ? " <p> " Maori action dance . Very cleansing . Any luck ? " <p> With an effort he brought his hand to his face and checked . Left nostril . Right nostril . Blocked as collapsed mine shafts. he sighed . <p> " Shit , " Annit said . Edward let his head fall back against the mat . He listened to her move around the room , rustling papers and muttering . The ceiling was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be a final circle that did not overlap any of the others , but he could n't find it . <p> A sound like a window shade springing up . Edward turned his head . Annit was consulting a life-size chart of the human body that had unrolled from the ceiling . She cradled a heavy book in her left arm . " Okay , " she said . The book dropped to the floor , loud as a cannon shot . The chart snapped upward . " Turn over again , Edward . " <p> " I do n't think this is going to help , " he said , half to himself . He did as he was told . Annit removed the sheet completely and applied fresh oil , rubbing him deeply until he forgot his plugged nostrils and his mind began to slide sideways into the half-dreaming trance he 'd attained earlier . She worked especially on his arms and legs , pressing her fingers deep into every joint from elbow to wrist , knee to ankle , and finished by wrapping each extremity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drifted , dreaming , drowning happily . For a long time Annit did n't touch him , leaving him alone with the squeaks of ropes and pulleys . Edward imagined elephants from the circuses of old movies , lumbering beasts dragging poles into place , hauling on ropes to pull the tents erect . Out there in the desert , in the shadow of Ayers Rock , there was a special tent going up , the arena where he and Michael were kept as freaks . Bright posters screamed SEE ! SIX-TOED SINUS MAN ! AND ! NASAL BOY ! The crowd roared as the tattooed warriors attached block and tackle to their cage and hauled it up above the audience . <p> Annit touched his neck . " Not that dream , Edward , " she said . " Not the false dream-time . " He heard a loud crack and suddenly he was hanging in space . he opened his eyes and found himself swinging above the floor , the massage table on its side against the wall . Several still-lit candles rolled in arcs across the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to take in air . <p> Annit 's voice was warm and commanding . " Edward . Edward . " <p> He was splayed apart , macrame ropes at each limb suspending him from the metal planter hooks . Annit , still naked , caught his shoulders and stopped his swaying . She bent down and held his face in both hands . Her eyes were even with his . " So what 's it going to be , Edward ? " <p> His arms were easing out of their sockets . His groin muscles were taut . " Huh ? " <p> " Do n't play stupid , Edward . What 's it going to be ? Back to your miserable world ? Dripping and sneezing your way through life , never three feet away from a box of Kleenex ? " <p> He shook his head , trying to assemble his thoughts . Far away , a pounding and the sound of Margaret 's voice , calling to him . <p> Annit slapped him across one cheek , then gripped his jaw and tilted his face toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , or going back ? What 's it going to BE ? " <p> His cheek burned . He could pull out now and walk into the lobby , shaking his head and thinking , Crazy woman . Margaret would run up to him , all expectant eyebrows : Still ? His son would hand him a tissue . <p> Edward drew a breath . " Unngah . " <p> Annit kissed him hard on the lips . " Okay , then . " She put her hands on his shoulders and pushed him back like a child in a swing-slowly , slowly - then back-pedaled to catch him and shove again . He closed his eyes as she worked the rhythm , feeling his arc grow by degrees heavier and steeper , his speed becoming tremendous . At the top of the arc , sinus fluid pressed to the front of his skull . As he swooped down , lights crackled under his eyelids . <p> The pounding on the door deepened and stretched and buzzed , becoming the bass throb of the bullroarer . <p> " Edward ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was at the zenith of his swing . The room was a fishbowl , walls curving out and back . Annit stood at the other end , naked except for her right arm , which was sheathed from elbow to fist in gleaming chrome . The gauntlet was medieval in design , covered with overlapping plates and studded with inch-long spikes , and seemed to end in too many fingers . <p> Annit stood waiting for him , legs apart and arm cocked , her eyes locked fiercely on his own . <p> She was braced for him . She could take him , if he trusted her . <p> He nodded - in agreement , in surrender , in benediction - and fell into her , swinging down , down , like two tons of metal . <p> Something furry brushed his cheek . He breathed deep , taking in a dense wave of unfamiliar scents , and opened his eyes . <p> He lay on his stomach , arms and legs spread , sunk deep in the grasses of a sunlit field . He turned his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed its forehead along his brow , marking him with its scent glands . he stroked the cat 's back and it arched into him , purring . A second cat butted against him , and a third , and a dozen more . <p> He got to his feet , careful not to tread on tails and paws . The prairie stretched for miles in all directions , a green ocean of Bermuda grass and Kentucky bluegrass and brilliant ragweed , swirling with rust and orange eddies of redtop and sagebrush . The plain stirred with the movements of furred animals : long-haired cats , thick-ruffed dogs , sleek-coated mammals he could n't name . <p> In the distance was a massive slump of naked rock , glowing pink in the sunlight . It was the flat-topped mountain he 'd seen in his dream . <p> Annit walked to him through a stand of towering pigweed , her hair wild , her skin still vividly painted . Michael held her hand , talking excitedly , and when she gestured to Edward the boy shouted happily and ran to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's eyes were clear and dry . His nasal drip had disappeared . <p> Annit stood a small way off , smiling . <p> " Where are we ? " Edward said . <p> A breeze touched his face and he inhaled deeply through wide-open nasal passages . The air was heavy with dense floral bouquets , earthy molds , and the pungent musk of thousands and thousands of cats . <p> IMG
