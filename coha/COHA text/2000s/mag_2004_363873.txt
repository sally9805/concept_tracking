When you 're a ninja , your job is slicing large evil people into large-evil-people cutlets . Motivation is not a problem . In Ninja Gaiden ( Xbox ; $49.99 ) , the latest installment in a venerable series that began on the old Nintendo Entertainment System , you play a limber little guy wearing a purple pantsuit who 's on some major quest , the point of which is not easy to understand  --  dragon this , family honor that and so on . Whatever . You wo n't get bored unless leaping into the air , running along a wall , doing a somersault , tossing three shuriken ( ninja throwing stars ) at a guy in samurai armor and then decapitating him in one smooth motion is something you do , like , all the time . Game-play-wise , Ninja Gaiden is a neat combination of fighting and exploring , and although it 's quite violent , the action is rendered in such lush detail  --  streaming sunlight , falling leaves , birds circling overhead  --  that it becomes almost balletic , like a Jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tough game with a steep learning curve , but nobody ever said fighting evil was easy . Especially in a purple pantsuit.  --  By Lev Grossman
