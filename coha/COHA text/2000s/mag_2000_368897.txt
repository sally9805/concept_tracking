As recently as five years ago , doctors thought they had a pretty clear picture of what causes a heart attack . They saw it as a plumbing problem : too much fat in the diet builds up in the blood vessels that feed the heart , creating stoppages that starve the heart of oxygen . It was an elegant model and one that patients could understand . But it 's not that simple . Cholesterol , it turns out , is just the starting point of a cascade of interlocking events . Underlying the new research presented at the American Heart Association meeting last week was a clear message : this is n't your father 's heart disease anymore . <P> INFLAMMATION <P> For years now , heart doctors have urged their patients to reduce the fat in their diet . But half of all heart attacks in the U.S. occur in people with normal cholesterol levels . Cardiologists knew something other than cholesterol was involved in heart disease ; they just did n't know what . <P> Now some of the other candidates have begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appears that the same all-out war that the body 's immune system launches against the joints in arthritis may also be waged in the blood vessels of the heart . No one knows exactly what sets off the immune system in heart patients ; it could be fatty deposits or bacteria or the toxins in cigarette smoke or even the physical strain caused by high blood pressure . But once the immune system locks on a target , it attacks relentlessly . White blood cells , clotting factors and a host of other soldiers of the body 's defense system swarm in and begin to pile up inside the vessel wall , forming plaques . The most dangerous plaques are those prone to rupture ; the explosive release of clotting factors and other cells into the blood can cause a heart attack . <P> So much for the theory . What was stirring excitement among heart specialists last week is that they now have a reliable way to track and measure the inflammation process . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , produced wherever there is inflammation , is consistently high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart attack . The latest data show that those with low levels of " bad " cholesterol ( LDL ) but high levels of CRP , as measured by a new supersensitive test , suffered the same rate of heart attacks as those with high levels of LDL and low CRP . " CRP testing should by no means replace cholesterol testing , " says Dr. Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women 's Hospital and a pioneer in the CRP field . " Lipids tell us how much plaque has built up in an artery , and CRP tells us how likely that plaque is to rupture and cause a heart attack . " <P> The good news for patients is that doctors have some powerful medications to keep inflammation in check . Aspirin , for one , may protect against heart disease not only by keeping clots from forming but also by controlling inflammation . And the newest studies show that even some of the statin drugs , such as pravastatin ( Pravachol ) and lovastatin ( Mevacor ) , which do such a good job of lowering cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> MORE ON STATINS
