The Book of Unholy Mischief <p> My name is Luciano  --  just Luciano . I 'm Venetian by birth , old now and chained to my memories , compelled to return , link by link , seeking clarity . <p> There 's a matter about which I am sworn to secrecy , but times have changed since I took my oath . In my lifetime , I 've witnessed man 's emergence from centuries of darkness . Great thinkers have unlocked our minds , and great artists have opened our eyes and our hearts . Some are calling it a renaissance  --  a rebirth  --  and it will reverberate far into the future because of a miraculous new invention called the printing press . Perhaps , now , it would be a disservice to the advancement of knowledge to remain silent . Perhaps the pendulum has swung a full arc , and the time has come for me to speak . If I proceed with caution ... well , those who have ears , let them hear . <p> The intrigue took place in my youth , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Venice . I first suspected some unholy mischief when the doge invited an uncouth peasant to dine with him in the palace . In the time-honored tradition of servants everywhere , I assumed my post behind the slightly open service door to the dining room in order to spy , and I marveled at the sight of them together : The doge , chief magistrate of the Most Serene Republic of Venice , gracious and bejeweled , sat with his guest , a bewildered paesano with calloused hands , dirt under his fingernails , and unwashed hair that had been hastily wetted and pushed off his face to show respect . <p> The meal began with clear calf's-foot broth served in shallow porcelain bowls so fine as to appear translucent in candlelight . The peasant offered the serving maid a sheepish smile and murmured , " Grazie , signora . " His rough voice clashed with his meek demeanor . <p> She snorted at his ignorance  --  the absurdity of thanking a serving maid  --  then bowed to the doge and took her leave . Out on the landing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb contadino enjoys his free meal . The doge is up to no good . " She shrugged and went down to the kitchen for the next course , but she need n't have bothered . <p> The peasant stared into his soup bowl like a Circassian studying tea leaves . Having come from his world myself , I could read his mind : Surely , here in the palace , soup should not be gulped from the bowl as it was in his own dirt-floor kitchen . How should he proceed ? <p> When the doge selected a large spoon from an array of filigreed silverware beside his plate , the peasant did the same . The shabby guest attempted to slide the soup silently into his mouth from the edge of the spoon , as the doge did , but gaps in his rotted teeth caused a loud , sibilant slurping . The man 's bristled face reddened , and he laid his spoon down in defeat . <p> The doge appeared not to notice . He smiled  --  a glimpse of gold winking from the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private stock of Valpolicella , a dark red wine with a floral bouquet and bittersweet aftertaste . With a hospitable tilt of his head , the doge said , " Per favore , signore , " and offered the goblet to his chastened dinner companion . <p> The poor man smiled timidly and wrapped two meaty hands around the goblet . He tried to drink his wine slowly , soundlessly , and this self-conscious attempt at delicacy allowed the wine to saturate his senses . Unaccustomed to such complexity of flavor , he drank the goblet down and finished with a lusty smacking of his lips . Flush with pleasure , he carefully placed his empty goblet on the lace tablecloth and turned to offer his thanks to the doge , but ... Marrone ! <p> The man 's smile twisted into a grimace . His forehead knotted like a ginger root , and he clawed at his throat . While he choked and struggled , his eyes spilled shock and confusion . He fell sideways off his needlework seat and tumbled headfirst onto the Turkish carpet with an inelegant thunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare . <p> The doge , a feeble , syphilitic old man , dabbed the corners of his mouth with a linen napkin , then heaved his royal personage off the chair . He steadied himself on the table edge with one liver-spotted hand , knelt over the corpse , and reached into the folds of his robe to bring forth a vial of amber liquid . He pried open the dead man 's mouth , tipped the vial to lips already turning blue , and carefully dribbled in his elixir . <p> With a grunt of disgust , the doge poked his finger into the fetid mouth , pressing on the tongue to make sure the fluid trickled down the dead man 's throat . When the vial was empty , the doge released the sigh of a man who has completed a small but unpleasant task . He pulled out the lemon-scented handkerchief he always kept tucked in his sleeve , wiped his hands , and then pressed the handkerchief to his nose . He inhaled deeply , clearly relieved to be able , finally , to counter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cumbersome brocades and with his handkerchief pressed firmly to his nose , sat back in his chair and watched the corpse with small , critical eyes . Absently , he adjusted his sly red cap so that the blunt peak at the back stood up , like a middle finger pointed at God . <p> Copyright 2008 by Elle Newmark , Inc . <br> Continues ...
