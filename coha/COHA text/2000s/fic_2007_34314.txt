I saw something . I saw something out of the corner of my eye . It 's been a week , but I still have that awful image in my mind . It burns . I close my eyes , and I see it . I open my eyes , and I see it . But . . . where are the words to describe it ? I feel nauseated . I stare at the glass of water on my desk , wanting to drink . I stare at the glass of water . The flat top of the liquid looks so strange to me now , a silver ellipse , quivering like my stomach , trembling with each tiny vibration-my nervous foot tapping on the wood floor , a voice in the next apartment , my breath . I need to settle myself . I have n't slept well for a week . In bed , I lie awake and think . My hands are shaking . I can barely write . Now I 'm looking at my hands , wrinkled yellow skin , veins crossing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my hands anymore . Where can I rest my eyes ? I see a pencil , stubby and blunt like a dull knife . How can something happen that is n't possible ? I do n't know . Black is white . White is black . Up is down , down is up . Perhaps I imagined it . I think that I saw something impossible . Am I crazy ? I 'm not crazy . Let me calm myself and figure out how to say this . I 'll pick up the dull knife of apencil and write . For breakfast this morning , I had a fried egg and two slices of dry toast , like anyone else , what little of it I could keep down . Before that , I shaved . I dressed . What else can I say ? Just at this moment , I 'm sitting at my desk by the window . I can look outside and see the street in front of my apartment building , children kicking a red ball back and forth , houses , mailboxes , garbage cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with damp clothes draped over it . Is n't that just normal life ? Or I could turn around in my chair and look at my room . I 'll do that . I see a bookshelf and books , some wedged in sideways . I see my bed , half covered with the quilt my ex-wife gave me . I see a standing brass lamp with a crooked linen lampshade . A box of crackers on the table , cracker crumbs . A glass of water on my desk , this pencil , this pad of paper.k The Pythagorean theorem , I still know : The square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of something or other . It has to do with the sides of triangles . Would a crazy person at age forty-two be able to remember anything about the Pythagorean theorem ? I 'm beginning to feel dizzy again . The nausea comes in heaving cartwheels . My hands . I ca n't write . I should just breathe slowly . Breathe . Breathe . Let me read what I 've written . Okay . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should list all the relevant factors . You see something weird , and , of course , the first thing you question is your eyesight . Or your mind . I want to put down in writing what I can . I 've tried to tell a few people , but I ca n't find the words . Even now , I ca n't find the words . Ellen suggested I write it down . I 'm not sure what she thinks , whether she really believes me . We were having dinner at her favorite Indian restaurant , she flirting with the waiter as she always does , half trying to make me jealous and half just being herself , and she held my hand after I told her and said I should write it down . Where was I ? My eyesight . When I go to the optometrist for my biannual examination , I can read the bottom row of letters on the chart . As a child , I was always the first one to spot the school bus coming . I could see the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yellow . My friends thought that I was cheating , that what I really saw was the cloud of dust trailing the bus , but I saw the tiny yellow dot . I 'll admit that I 've never needed such good eyesight for any practical purpose . My books have regular-size type . When I worked in the bank , the numbers were never so small , but I could have read them if they had been . My hearing is also good . When I saw what I saw , I did n't hear anything unusual . I have no recollection of any sound at all , aside from the ticking of the clock in Martin 's office . And I do n't think I 'm at all . . . how should I put it . . . suggestible . I believe that 's the word . Never in my life have I been suggestible . At a party years ago , a hypnotist tried to put me under and failed . He said I was not " suggestible , " and then he looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . If I could travel back to that party years ago-I think I was in my mid-twenties-I would tell that guy and everyone else that I am happy not being suggestible . I prefer seeing the world as it is . I feel slightly better . I managed a sip , and I am holding it down . Breathe . Now my head is beginning to boil . And the cartwheels are flying again . I wish I had n't seen what I saw . I want the world to go back to where it was a week ago . The thing lasted only a few seconds . A few seconds . Why ca n't those five seconds be smudged out and erased ? What is five seconds in the space of a year , or even a day ? I must have imagined it . I caught it only out of the corner of my eye . Just a brief hovering thing in the corner of my eye . What was it ? Where are the words to say what it was ? The thing looked so real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagine something so real and so bizarre at the same time ? I was feeling fine that day . I was n't having headaches or eye problems or strange thoughts . My mind was clear . That morning , I arrived at the mortuary at nine , as usual . I made some phone calls to locate a death certificate , I met with Martin , I helped a family pick out a casket . And then , in the late afternoon , in the slumber room , that 's when it happened . I do n't believe in supernatural phenomena . I do n't believe in magic or hyperkinesis or spirits . When I was a child , my aunt told me that the seasons are needed for plants to grow , and that the sacred Spirit of All Living Things re-creates the seasons each year . With all due respect to my aunt , the seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth . The Earth is just a big ball of dirt out there in space , and it happens to have a tilt to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some meteor hit the Earth by accident and cocked it over at an angle . In summer , the Earth 's axis points toward the sun , making us hotter . In winter , it points away from the sun , making us colder . What could be more logical ? Cause and effect . No tilt , no seasons . It 's physics , or whatever . It 's like the Pythagorean theorem . I 'm exhausted . What ? What ? How long did I nod off in my chair ? I should look at my watch on the bureau , but what does it matter . Time has passed . The shadows have moved through the room . I 'm just writing down everything that comes into my head . It 's something to do . I should go out for a walk , call Ellen , anything . Somewhere in my apartment there 's a novel I would finish if I could bring myself to read . It 's a novel by a Japanese writer about an umemployed man who sits at home all day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . I came home from work , walked next door to the diner , and asked Marie to bring me some hot tea . Then I just sat at the window of my apartment and watched the sheets of rain falling outside . I did n't go out for supper . It was raining too hard , considering that my galoshes have holes in them . Some of the tenants ventured out and returned laughing and sneezing and dripping pools of water by the front door . Marie , bless her heart , stayed late to make sandwiches for us housebound tenants . She personally brought over the food and delivered it to each person 's apartment , humming some show tune . Marie often stays late at the diner or here in the apartments , even though she has her own family to take care of-a bedridden husband with multiple sclerosis and a grown son who gambles away all his money and lives at home . Occasionally , her son comes here , knocking on doors and asking for a loan . Just a one-week loan , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells a heartbreaking story . Then Marie chases him off , he begins screaming at her , she screams back at him . From time to time , I do give him a little money . Voices trickle in from the hall . Henry . George . Raymond . Someone else I ca n't place , a new tenant . Most are middle-aged men like myself , single , living on moderate incomes . A few younger guys , trying to save . A few women and married couples . Although I 've been here for several years , I still do n't know any of the other tenants well , certainly not as friends . We see one another at breakfast . We pass in the hall , or at the laundry in the basement . I 've come to realize that I do n't want any friends here . I 've had friends in other places and at other times of my life . To be honest , I do n't mind being alone . I read . Something changed after Bethany left me . I wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at the same time . I 'm just writing . It 's something to do . I do n't even know if everything I write is true . I 've got to hold my burning head very still . Or I should lie down . Perhaps Marie can get me an icepack for my head . But I should n't burden her with another task on her day off . Today she should be home with her family , or at church . Early this morning , she came into the lobby downstairs wearing a beautiful dress and pink high-heeled shoes and said that she was on her way to church but just wanted to stop by and " tidy a bit . " That was hours ago , and she has n't left . I can hear her singing in the hall . Marie truly seems to enjoy the place , all the more so because it used to be a rambling old house , with a sitting room downstairs , and she says it has a " coziness " to it . Marie believes in the supernatural . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was n't surprised , with my working in a mortuary . She said that spirits remain in the body for three days after mortal death . And she spoke the word mortal with an emphasis . Marie believes that she has received certain signals from her dead mother , such as odd chirpings of birds and doors suddenly opening by themselves . She reads the astrologer 's report in the newspaper . Logic , I should say to Marie . But I do n't want to upset her . Marie has been extremely kind to me , and she earns very little for her long hours . But I want her to understand . Cause and effect . The tilt of the Earth . Am I repeating myself ? I want to say to her : Logic is what holds it all together . Without logic , anything could happen . People could turn into frogs . The Moon could suddenly fly off into space . If one illogical thing happens , then a million illogical things can happen . The entire world might come apart piece by piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve of your jacket . The fabric starts to unravel . And once it starts to unravel , nothing can stop it . First the sleeve comes undone , then the shoulder , then the lapel . Marie has been asking questions about what I saw at the mortuary . Yesterday morning at the diner , she came over and sat next to me and she said , " You 've been chosen . " I realize now that I should n't have told her anything . " I imagined it , " I said to her . Maybe I did imagine it . " No , you did n't , " she said quietly . Then she asked me to take her to the mortuary , to the slumber room . I should n't have told her anything . I feel ill . I 'm not sure anymore what I know and do n't know . It 's Sunday . Yesterday was Saturday . I should go out for my walk by the lake . I should visit Ellen , do something . But my hands are shaking . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
