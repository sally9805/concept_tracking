In one of the photo albums in her West Wing office , Condoleezza Rice keeps a picture of herself and President George W. Bush in a rowboat on a pond at the President 's ranch in Crawford , Texas . Bush is standing at one end , peering over the edge at the bass in his stocked fishing hole . Rice is sitting at the other end , visibly uncomfortable . She may love talking sports with the President , but she 's no fan of the water . " She can swim , but she does n't like it , " says a friend . " She and the outdoors are only on distant acquaintance . " <P> It is a measure of Rice 's success at building their relationship that Bush is comfortable testing her , even during the off-hours . She started out as his tutor on foreign affairs when he was still Governor of Texas . But once she became his National Security Adviser , " her primary job was to understand the President and understand how he wanted to be served , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous boss and mentor . " And she did that brilliantly . " Now that Bush has nominated her to be his Secretary of State , the question is where she stands on the foreign policy fights of the day . Despite four years as one of the Administration 's most vocal advocates on this front , Rice has shown few fixed ideological moorings . <P> She has changed positions dramatically on several issues , shifting from a hard-nosed student of realpolitik to a true believer in Bush 's vision of spreading democracy from Morocco to Afghanistan . Her transformation " was a bit of an iterative process , " she told TIME last month . " One of the President 's contributions had been to remind us all , again , of the link between our security and our values . " <P> She originally rebuffed attempts by Russian President Vladimir Putin to build relations with the Administration but then accepted him as an ally after Bush famously said he had looked into Putin 's soul . When King Abdullah of Jordan first proposed in the summer of 2002 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict , Rice tried to block it but later became a fervent backer . In 2000 she scorned the use of U.S. troops for nation building , but has undertaken monumental military reconstruction projects in Afghanistan and Iraq . She led the hard-liners ' charge to unilaterally abrogate the antiballistic-missile treaty with Russia but showed a multilateralist streak by backing Powell 's push to engage the U.N . ahead of war in Iraq . <P> Critics say that more often than not she simply has settled into orbit around the real power centers of U.S. foreign policy : Vice President Dick Cheney and his ally Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld . " She 's getting this job because she 's not a threat , " says retired Lieut . General William Odom of the conservative Hudson Institute . When Rice tried to impose order on prewar planning , Rumsfeld ignored her . Vice President Cheney established a broad and powerful shadow National Security Council early in the Administration and used his close relationship with Bush to drive White House decision making . Yet some foreign diplomats praise her all-business style as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation of Powell . " When Powell comes , he 's got hordes of reporters , " says a diplomat . " When Condi comes , she 's got no reporters ; there are no photo ops . She 's there for the kill . "
