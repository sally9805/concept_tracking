Kathy Soder rests a hand on the Holstein cow . With the other , she removes the plug to the portal-like fistula that 's surgically implanted into the animal 's side . Gently tugging a pink string , she fishes out a series of small white bags from the cow 's rumen , the largest compartment of its multichambered stomach . The procedure does n't harm the cow , but it gives animal scientists like Soder unprecedented access to the animal 's digestive system . <p> Back at her Agricultural Research Service laboratory , located on the campus of Pennsylvania State University ( PSU ) , Soder processes the bags so that the digested plant remains inside can be dried , weighed , and chemically analyzed . <p> " I 'm looking at how quickly and how much is digested by the cow , " explains Soder , who is in ARS 's Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit , University Park , Pennsylvania . " This gives us an idea of rumen availability  --  how much forage is broken down into products like amino acids that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of four fistulated cows in a herd of 20 Holsteins that are rotationally grazed on experimental pastures . The pastures contain mixtures of up to nine different species of cool-season grasses ; legumes , such as clover ; and forbs , like chicory . Soder 's analysis of how efficiently the herd digests these forage plants is part of a larger study by a team of ARS and PSU scientists working at the college 's Dairy Research Center . There , with the aid of the fistula and other research tools , the group aims to find out whether dairy farmers can boost milk production  --  or cut the costs of doing so  --  by seeding pastures with diverse blends of forage plants . <p> " Farmers typically manage their pasture with one or two species , like a grass and a legume . We want to find out whether it would be better for them to plant more diverse species , " says ARS agronomist Matt Sanderson . He and Soder are conducting the trials at the center with PSU professor Larry Muller and two University Park ARS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah Goslee . <p> By design , their work coincides with growing interest in pasture-based dairy ( PBD ) systems as a lower cost , more sustainable alternative to confined feed operations . The trend seems especially popular among small or family-run dairy farms in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest , like Wisconsin , notes Soder . <p> In Pennsylvania , she says , " 10 to 15 percent of farmers are now grazing dairy cows to some degree . " Pasture-based herds ( those using a combination of pasture and supplementation ) generally produce 10 percent less milk than herds in comparable confined feed operations , she adds . But a savvy PBD farmer , or " grazier , " can increase profits from about $85 to $168 per cow annually through savings on rime , labor , equipment , fuel , storage , and other expenses typically associated with confined operations . <p> The trend 's popularity has outpaced the science a bit , and only recently have U.S. researchers taken a closer look at the potential benefits of diversifying the types of pasture plants that farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is : ' Does increased biodiversity improve productivity , either of the pasture or the animal ? ' " says Sanderson . <p> To that end , Sanderson , Skinner , and Goslee have established eight 2.5-acre pastures that contain different combinations of grasses , legumes , and forbs . The pastures include a control ( a two-species mix of orchard grass and white clover ) and three other mixtures of plant species from different " functional groups . " These include a three-species mix of orchard grass and white clover plus chicory ; a six-species mix of these three plus tall fescue , perennial ryegrass , and birdsfoot trefoil ; and a nine-species mix of these six plus red clover , alfalfa , and Kentucky bluegrass . <p> Functional groups , Sanderson explains , are communities of plants that belong to different species but share common traits or functions within the same ecosystem . The relationships are mutually beneficial , such as that between grasses and legumes like alfalfa or clover , which fix atmospheric nitrogen into a chemical form that both species can use for growth . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what northeastern dairy farmers use to seed their grazing lands . " We 're using the same plants as the farmer , " Sanderson says , " but our approach calls for more complex mixtures of these plants . " <p> Using various techniques , his group is collecting data on each pasture 's botanical composition , crude protein content , photosynthesis rate , and yield of dry forage matter . In one approach , called stratification , they 're measuring the concentration of forage species at different levels of the pasture canopy . The results show which species grazing cows are likely to encounter first and provide the researchers with data they can correlate to grazing behavior and preferences . " We 're also studying the nutritional value of the plants as you go up and down the canopy , " says Sanderson . <p> Ultimately , the scientists want to know how such pasture-plant dynamics translate to animal productivity . " We 're looking at milk yield and composition  --  specifically milk fat and protein , " Soder explains . <p> In 2002 , Soder and Muller followed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials , which involved rotationally grazing 20 Holsteins on the pastures for four 21-day periods . As before , Sanderson 's team monitored the pasture 's botanical composition , forage quality , yield , and persistence . But this rime , they did so before and after the animals had grazed the plots . <p> During each grazing period , Soder and Muller kept close tabs on the herd 's dry matter intake , digestive rates , milk production and quality , body weight , blood composition , rumen nutrient use , and other physiological markers . <p> To gauge how much time and energy the cows spend grazing in relation to their forage intake , the scientists fitted special halters around each animal 's head . A chin strap with a computer chip records 12 hours ' worth of data on how many bites the cow takes as it grazes , as well as when and for how long . The device also differentiates such behavior from resting or cud chewing . " Grazing behavior can depend on factors such as pasture type , density , height , and availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to estimate grazing efficiency of the different pasture treatments in relation to productivity . " <p> In another technique , the scientists give the cows gel capsules of chromic oxide , a harmless substance that passes undigested through the animals . By taking a fecal specimen , the scientists can measure the substance 's concentration and correlate that with the animal 's intake of dry forage matter . <p> On average , the trial 's Holsteins each eat 90 to 100 pounds of " wet " forage , which translates to about 25 pounds of " dry " matter , that is , forage minus its water weight . From those 25 pounds of forage dry matter  --  plus a grain supplement  --  a cow produces 10 to 12 gallons of milk a day , Soder says . <p> Her analysis of a cow 's milk yield and composition also includes checking for conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA ) , a fatty acid produced in the rumen and credited with anticarcinogenic properties . " We 're monitoring this because research has shown that pastured dairy cows have higher levels of CLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soder . <p> In March 2003 , Soder and Sanderson reported preliminary results from the 2002 trials at the Pennsylvania Grazing and Forage Conference held in Grantville , Pennsylvania . They noted , for example , that the total pounds of forage dry matter per acre for the 3- , 6- , and 9-species plots were 6,600 , 7,000 , and 6,700 , respectively . That 's compared to 4,300 pounds per acre for the 2-species plot used as a control . The fiber content of the pasture decreased as species diversity increased , a potential benefit . Despite these differences , " In general , milk production and composition were not affected by the level of forage diversity , " Soder stated at the conference . For example , the average milk yield was 80 pounds ( about 10 gallons ) per cow per day , while the average fat content in the milk of cows on all four plots was 3.46 percent . <p> " Not seeing a milk difference is n't necessarily a bad thing , " says Soder . The main advantage the researchers expect from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cows per acre than one with a single plant species . A highly productive pasture is also likely to cut the time and energy cows spend searching for edible forage . That , in turn , means more energy for producing milk . <p> Soder and colleagues have begun a second round of grazing trials to confirm the 2002 results . As more findings emerge , the team plans to devise recommendations farmers can use to manage diverse pasture mixes for grazing . Soder adds , " The information gained from this experiment will also add to the limited data available on the intake and performance of high-producing grazing dairy cows in the United States , since much of current literature comes from other countries .
