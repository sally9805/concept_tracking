YOUR HEALTH Headnote Going Vegan has Never Been Easier Sarah Florez traces her veganism to a life-altering experience at the age of seven . Florez visited a turkey farm four days before Thanksgiving . As she stood there with the rest of her Girl Scout Troop , eye to eye with the turkeys , something clicked . That night , she went home and put her foot down . " I said Tm really sorry , Mom , but I just ca n't do it . I ca n't eat turkey this year . ' ' " Her well-meaning mother called a restaurant and arranged for this budding vegetarian to have a big slab of ham instead . But it was a start . Today , Florez owns Three Little Figs , a vegan market in Boulder , Colorado . She 's famous for her indulgent dairy-free mac " n cheese and eggless chocolate chip cookie dough . Her store sells everything from spicy curry mix to soy cheese ravioli and creamy strawberry truffles . For Florez , it 's all about the animals . She adopted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter for abused poultry and livestock in Watkins Glen , New York . " I thought I could never live without cheese , " she says . " But once I learned about the cruelty that goes on in the egg and dairy industry , it took no effort to give it up . " In fact , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) estimates you can save 100 farm animals by switching to a vegan diet . Florez calls it " voting for good with a sandwich . " A Big Commitment It 's not dear how many Americans are vegans . A 2002 Time/CNN poll said 0.2 percent . A 2006 poll by the Vegetarian Resource Group says 1.4 percent follow that diet . Chris Beckley , president of the Colorado Vegetarian Society , cites a one percent figure , and adds that more people are making the switch every day . Many are motivated by environmental concerns . " It takes an enormous amount of water to make a pound of meat , " Beddey says . " It 's extremely wasteful from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give up meat , eggs and milk and you can do your part to prevent erosion , factory farm runoff , global warming and the overuse of antibiotics . Not to mention salmonella and E.coli outbreaks . Eating lower on the food chain also makes more room to feed hungry people in developing countries . And there 's an equally convincing reason to go vegan : better health . Studies show vegans have a lower rate of heart disease and diabetes because they eat less fat and more fruits , veggies and fiber . The National Cancer Institute is currently funding research into how vegan diets might help prevent brain and prostate cancer . " Vegetarians tend to consume higher intakes of phytochemicals , which have anti-cancer activity , " says Keri Cans , a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association . Leafy greens and orange vegetables offer the strongest cancer prevention . Meanwhile , PETA estimates vegans are nine times less likely to be obese . Vegans have an average cholesterol of 133 , compared with 210 for meat eaters , PETA says . Eating less dairy also reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine . Author John Robbins ( The Food Revolution ) claims vegans live an average of six to 10 years longer than meat eaters . Meeting the Challenges " Anybody who plans it well and thinks it out will do fine on it , " says Janet M. Melton , assistant director of Inpatient Clinical Dietetics for Mayo Healthcare in Rochester , Minnesota . New vegans worry about getting enough protein without eggs , milk or cheese . But Melton says we do n't need as much protein as people think . It 's about 50 grams per day for women and 60 grams per day for men , she estimates . Good vegan protein sources include tofu , tempeh , nut butters , soy or rice milk and cheese , nuts and seeds . Calcium can be another concern , especially for women who are at higher risk for osteoporosis . Luckily , there are plenty of fortified soy milks and orange juice brands . Leafy greens , figs and almonds are other good sources of calcium . Calcium needs vary between about 1,000 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get older . Vegans who do n't eat a varied diet can be at risk for anemia ( lack of iron ) or vitamin B12 deficiency . Severe fatigue is a symptom of both . Vegans should get 2.4 micrograms per day of B12 , Melton says . Men and post-menopausal women need eight milligrams per day of iron , according to the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance ( RDA ) . Women age 18 to 50 need 18 milligrams of iron per day . Ironrich foods include dark leafy greens and beans . Eat these foods with vitamin C ( in orange juice , lemon or tomatoes ) for better absorption , Melton says . Take it Seriously Being a vegan is a responsibility , says Miami dietician Lisa Dorfinan , nutrition advisor to the U.S. Olympic women 's sailing team and author of The Vegetarian Sports Nutrition Guide . " You ca n't be a poor-eating vegan , " Dorfinan says . So what do experienced vegans eat ? A tour around Whole Foods shows you can find vegan substitutes for nearly everything . They sell non-dairy ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surprisingly tasty canned chili with seitan instead of ground beef . " You 're seeing a lot of grocery stores going over to vegan and vegetarian entres , " says Beckley . " It 's definitely a growing trend . " Eaters new to veganism may find their stomachs rumbling late at night . Before you fill up on another bowl of Soy Delicious ice cream , Joanne Saltzman ( author of Intuitive Cooking ) suggests rethinking your meal plan . She recommends eating good fats , such as olive oil , avocado and nuts . " You need them to make you feel satisfied , " she adds . In her vegetarian cooking classes at the School of Natural Cookery in Boulder , Colorado , Saltzman offers a simple strategy for creating vegan meals . Just pick a protein source ( like beans or tofu ) , a whole grain ( say , brown rice or cous cous ) and some vegetables . Put them together with sauces and spices and you 've got a well-rounded dinner . <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
