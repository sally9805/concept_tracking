CONSTELLATIONS Summer 1979 One summer many years ago , the Rubins and the Berkowitzes were out on the porch of the house they rented on the Jersey Shore in Allenhurst . It was a moonless night and stars were rising out from beyond the fold of the horizon . Two constellations kept on growing , almost like trees . Anthony Rubin watched the ocean . Each time another star popped over the horizon , he readjusted his idea of just what the shapes resembled . First he saw something that looked like a big panther . Then the shape turned into a box kite . Claudia Berkowitz lit a cigarette . She turned to Anthony 's father and said , " Michael , you were a Boy Scout . Should n't you know the constellations ? " " He was too busy chasing Girl Scouts , " said Jess Rubin , Anthony 's mother . Michael stood up and said , " Well , I can at least tell you what I learned from my great-uncle . He sold scrap metal . We used to visit him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jess . " Sit down . " Claudia smiled and said , " Wait , I want to hear this . " " These are the Yiddish constellations , " Michael continued . " Somebody stop him , " said Claudia 's husband , Douglas , but no one did . Anthony 's father raised his hand . He pointed up to a bright zigzag of four stars . " Right there , " he said . " We can see the shiny belt of the Yenta , Miriam . " He pointed lower , to a cluster of stars that looked like a falling teapot . " And below Miriam , down on the horizon . That 's Ira Nusbaum , the Swindler . Good thing that bandit 's 40,000 light-years away . " He moved his hand across the sky and then picked out another random cluster . He said , " And here , to the north , we can see Maury , the Disappointment . This constellation was named after my third cousin , Maury Rosenthal . You 'll always find it near the luminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He paused and Claudia chimed in , " Wait . I think I 'm seeing Howie Grossman , the Great Schlemiel . " " That 's very good , " Michael said . " Do we all know the myth of Howie ? " " Michael , enough , " said Jess . Anthony saw that his mother 's eyes were incandescing with silent anger . He wondered whether she was offended . She 'd been raised Orthodox and had gone to a yeshiva as a girl . But she 'd stopped going after sixth grade . She had renounced all that yeshiva had tried to teach her , not to mention her parents ' orthodoxy . When asked , his mother always claimed to be an atheist , and so he could not fathom why the Yiddish constellations made her angry . " Poor Howie dropped the Torah during his own bar mitzvah , " Michael continued . " Such a schlemiel , " Claudia said , and raised her cigarette to her lips . " To keep him out of temple on High Holidays , God gave Howie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled out , " Stop ! " She glared at Claudia and rose . She crossed the porch and descended the wooden stairs , down to the sand . Anthony 's father followed after her . When he caught up with her they stood talking on the beach for a few seconds . Then Jess walked off and headed down the shoreline . Anthony knew where she was going . In recent weeks she 'd spent half of her time out on the jetty . She sat alone , watching the ocean . She sometimes sat so far out that she got drenched by the spray of waves . Anthony saw that his father was returning , a web of stars hanging directly above his head as he walked back . When he stepped onto the porch , he said , " She 's fine . She 's just going to the jetty . " He grabbed his drink and went inside to wait for her in their room . Later that night , Anthony and Jay Berkowitz were out wandering the Asbury Park boardwalk . It was just one beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times a day . They were with their closest down-the-shore friends , Bradley Kalish and Andy Sullivan . They all played Skee-Ball for a while , then walked the boards , acting like jerks , as they often did . Andy Sullivan was a studlong white-blond hair and blue eyes . Having him with them seemed to give the foursome license to talk to any pretty girls they saw . Not that they knew what to do when girls would actually respond . They were all thirteen , except Jay , who was eleven . At some point they returned to Allenhurst , went down to the beach , and midget-wrestled . They had seen tag-team midget-wrestling on television . Now they had given themselves names . Jay was Wizard Eyes . Bradley was Laughing Man . Anthony was Puckhead and Andy was Dr. Death . They 'd be announcers while they wrestled and always staged impossible situations . They would announce things such as , " Wizard Eyes , in a brilliant move , has ripped Dr. Death 's arm off . " Andy would then have to wrestle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestling , Anthony saw his mother . She 'd just come off the nearest jetty and was walking back toward the house . He saw the stars in the sky above her . In some strange way his mother seemed like a constellation . He was about to run off after her , ask her why she got upset about the myth of Howie Grossman . Then Andy decked him . Jay jumped on top . He yelled , " And Puckhead is now crushed by a double dogpile ! " Bradley dove in and yelled , " But Laughing Man ... now mutilates Dr. Death and Wizard Eyes ! " Anthony squirmed out from the pileup , rolled , and looked again for his mother . He tried to find her in the darkness , but she was gone . During that summer they all became junior lifeguards . They got paid five dollars an hour . It was Andy 's idea . His older brother , Shane , was the Allenhurst Beach lifeguard . Shane started out as a junior lifeguardat least , he claimed to have . Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the junior lifeguards in the past . As junior lifeguards they did n't do much lifeguarding . From time to time , Shane would take one of them up on watch . Mostly he took Anthony 's sister , Dani , who was fifteen and just starting to fill out her bikini . She got more lifeguarding instruction from Shane than anyone , though she was n't an official junior lifeguard . She would n't take part in the main junior lifeguard dutycleaning the beach . It was their job to get up at seven every morning and sweep the beach for whatever garbage the tide had brought in the night before . They 'd get old sneakers , plastic bags , strange cans , occasionally a T-shirt . They also found lots of nonjunkpieces of coral , dead starfish , shells , and that amazing ocean phenomenon known as sea glass . They would find rounded , opaque glass in colors ranging from dark brown to green to lavender . Anthony always thought it miraculous that broken glass , pollution , could be transformed into these gems that lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they woke up and found tar balls . It seemed another amazing ocean phenomenon , but not something they really wanted to keep . The balls were sticky and gross , though they looked hard , almost like marbles , when they washed up in the tide line . All week long Anthony , Jay , Bradley , and Andy collected the balls with shovels . They gathered hundreds of balls each day , while never knowing what they were or where they came from . One morning in July , they woke to find the beach covered with syringes . It made the news hundreds of plastic little syringes without needles . Apparently , they 'd been illegally dumped at sea . The syringes were reported from Sandy Hook all the way to Manasquan . People were frightened of the syringes , which came in heavy for a week or so . Barely anyone would show up on the beach . Each day the junior lifeguards collected bagsful . At first they had to turn them over to the Environmental Police . Then it became a kind of mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as if his life depended on it . Despite the fear most people had , he knew the empty syringes were quite harmless . He always trusted the magic of the ocean to make things safe . One night the four boys were playing Skee-Ball at the arcade on the Asbury Park boardwalk . To his own stupefaction and even mild discomfort , Anthony found that he could n't miss . He barely tried , it seemed , yet almost every ball he rolled up the ramp jumped gently and arced right into the small bull's-eye , worth fifty points . During one game he scored a rare , perfect four hundred . The machine spit out a very long strip of win tickets . He turned uneasily to Bradley , who was playing in the lane next to him . " Hey , check this out , " Anthony said . " A perfect game . " Bradley rolled his ball and got a thirty . He said , " No way , " and turned to Anthony . He eyed the win tickets , which hung all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy , check this out . Rubin just scored a perfect game . " Anthony glanced around for Jay . The last he 'd looked , Jay was playing three lanes away . He said , " Where 's Jay ? " " Beats me , " said Bradley . " Maybe the wizard boy went to do some math . " Andy said , " Jesus , check out all those tickets . " Anthony grabbed them and stuffed the tickets into his pocket . He turned to Bradley and said , " I 'll be right back . " He started searching the arcade . He traversed three rows of Skee-Ball lanes and wove his way through all the rake-a-prize machines . He walked around the corner by the fun house , looked across the room toward the squirt-gun balloon clown game . He had the inexplicable sense that he 'd find something , and he did . He saw his father standing next to Claudia . She was leaning over the railing , her big butt staring Anthony in the face . His father 's hand was resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirting at the mouth of a plastic clown . A red balloon was inflating out of the clown 's head . One balloon popped . It was n't Claudia 's . A little freckly-faced boy on the end had beaten her . Anthony sprinted out of the arcade before they turned . He found Jay wandering by the railing . He ran up wildly and said , " I saw them . " Jay said , " Me too . " " It was n't anything , " said Anthony . " They 're in there playing that stupid clown game . " Jay nodded . Anthony could not tell whether Jay was denying or confirming the assessment . Jay said , " Let 's go down to the beach before they see us . " They were n't Asbury Park junior lifeguards , but it was bright from all the boardwalk lights and easy to find syringes . They gathered them out of habit , dropping them into an empty popcorn box they pulled out of a trash can . When they hit Allenhurst Beach they kept on walking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as the next town , Deal , then something happened . As if some magical wind were blowing , the ocean sky grew clear and dark , and filled with stars . " Holy shit , " Jay said . " They 're even brighter than that night your father did the Yiddish constellations . " " There 's Sophie , the Kvetch , " said Anthony , and pointed . Jay said , " That 's actually part of Cepheus , the King . " " How do you know that ? " Anthony asked . " I bought a star chart . I 've been learning . " " You bought a star chart ? " Jay said , " Yeah . They have them on sale at the Shop Rite . My mother bought them for my brother and me . You should get one , or else you could steal Stuart 's . He 'd never notice . " It turned out Stuart , who was eight , had already lost his star chart . The next day Anthony bought a star chart of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach at night and learned whatever summer constellations they could find . Sometimes they could n't match a cluster to the chart , but Jay explained that there were many more stars than people would ever name . Jay said he 'd read long ago in Ranger Rick that there were more stars in the universe than grains of sand on the whole earth . When Anthony thought of deserts , this seemed impossible . Most nights in Allenhurst they were lucky if five constellations were visible . One night when Anthony got up to use the bathroom , he could see part of a constellation out the window . Framed by the windowpane , it looked just like a map . He moved closer , to see it all , and quickly realized it was Scorpio . Then he heard breathing from below . When he looked down he saw his father and his mother . Out on the porch his dad was kissing her neck and unbuttoning her baggy flannel shirt . He kept on watching , thinking maybe he was dreaming . It almost did n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let his chin rest on the windowsill . There was a glow from the other porch lights , and an ocean wind that carried their breaths and sighs up to the window . He saw his mother push his father 's head back . He saw her slide the flannel shirt off her shoulders , then draw his face into her bosom . Her assertiveness amazed him . He kept wondering if somehow it were Claudia in disguise . But she was too tall and too agile , too lithe and sprightly in her movements to be Claudia . He saw his father kissing her breasts while his mother laughed and caressed his head . They both seemed happy , or else they were both drunk . The next morning , she seemed calmer than she had for all that summer . She did n't go out to the jetty . She read and listened to the radio on the porch . At noon she asked Anthony and Dani if they wanted to go for burgers at the Windmill , their favorite restaurant . They all piled into her blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who finally asked the question . They were eating on the top deck of the converted windmill , the lowest blade of the wooden rotor angling off to the right of Dani 's head . She said , " So Mom , what 's going on ? " Their mother looked up from her burger . " What do you mean ? " she asked . " She means you 've been kind of a nervous wreck all summer , " Anthony said . She put her burger down and said , " I had a scare . There was a chance that I had cancer of the cervix . " " And you found out it is n't anything ? " Anthony asked her . Their mother nodded . She said , " Last night . " " Everything 's fine then ? " She said , " Everything is fine for the time being . " " You must have been so scared , " said Anthony . " It would have been okay to tell us , " Dani said . " I did n't think so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diet Coke . " I always knew it was n't cancer . Still I was trying to get ready , just in case . " During the second week of August , the fecal coliform count got so high that all the beaches closed . Apparently , there was some sort of flesh-eating bacteria in the water . Shane Sullivan claimed that the bacteria came from raw sewage that had been dumped into the ocean . He also claimed that it caused human skin to molt and come off like a crab shell . The beaches stayed closed for six days . Anthony , Jay , Bradley , and Andy midget-wrestled and hung around the Asbury Park arcade . One rainy afternoon the four boys stood around the prize counter . They discussed prize options and what they planned to cash in all their win tickets for come Labor Day . Andy and Bradley both wanted the Muhammed Ali boxing gloves . Jay , who had barely any tickets , said he would probably go for the plastic back scratcher . After much deliberation , Anthony found that the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse that was actually a coin bank . When he pointed the horse out , Jay said , " That 's Pegasus , from mythology , just like the constellation . " They had seen Pegasus several times while star-watching that summer . Somehow this incidental correlation settled things . Anthony nodded and said , " Yeah , that 's what I 'm going for . " That was also the week Bradley started them listening to Bruce Springsteen . He had just purchased a small boom box . He had four Bruce tapes and claimed that Bruce once dated his older sister . He started toting the boom box everywhere , playing all songs as loud as possible . One day while blasting the album Born To Run , Bradley suddenly stopped walking . He turned the volume down and looked at his friends dramatically . Then he said , " We are walking through Bruce 's songs . " Jay and Anthony immediately got their parents to buy them Born To Run on cassette . They started listening to it religiously , and soon they knew every cryptic word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run evoked a sadness , that certain songs were almost cinematic . Each time they listened to " Thunder Road , " all of the lyrics would unfold again inside him . He 'd always see a screen door slam . Then he would picture some wondrous girl named Mary , her dress waving as she danced across the floor of their house in Allenhurst . Toward the end of that week of the closed beaches , they even had one Bruce-related miracle . They met two Teaneck girls , Denise and Jackie . The girls approached while Bradley was blasting " Rosalita " on his boom box . They started singing along and saying things like , " Totally awesome song ! " Both went for Andy , of course , but he played soccer . Just a day after they met the girls , Andy left the shore in order to go to soccer camp in Maryland . This made things easier and soon they were all hanging out together on the boards . Denise and Jackie were best friends . Jackie was fragile and quiet . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony to wonder what she was thinking . Meanwhile Denise seemed the quintessential Jersey girl . She had thick black hair and plump breasts and would call out " Jinx ! " whenever she and another person spoke the same word at the same time . Then she would punch the person 's arm until the person named five movie stars or beer brands or whatever Denise asked for . Likewise Anthony always had to say " safety " if he burped , otherwise Denise would say " slugs " and then start punching . She had three brothers , which explained her sort of tomboy roughhouse nature . She even liked to midget-wrestle . Both she and Jackie got their own names , the Big Babe and Psycho Kitty . One afternoon Anthony wound up alone with Jackie on the boardwalk . He had a crush on her by then . Jackie was eating cotton candy . They were both leaning against a railing , talking and watching small children ride the Asbury Park carousel . He got his guts up and placed his hand on hers . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to his bold gesture . They continued chatting as Jackie ate her cotton candy , her captured hand still clasping the metal railing . Finally Jackie pulled her hand back . She held out the purple cotton candy and said , " Want some ? " He took a bite . She said , " You 're Jewish , right ? " He nodded . " Then why the heck is your name Anthony ? I 've never met a Jew named Anthony in my life . " " I had this cousin , " he said . " Anthony Spignatelli . He was half Jewish , half Italian . He died two months before I was born . Until then my parents planned to name me Eric , or else Jill . " " How did he die ? " " It was a mystery . " " They have to know . " " They say they did n't . " He took her hand again . For a few seconds Jackie stared as if assessing the situation . Anthony smiled , clasped her hand tighter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her hand away . Allenhurst Beach reopened on a Sunday in mid-August . By then Anthony , Jay , and Bradley were getting bored with being junior lifeguards . They 'd make one garbage pass in the morning , then they would run off to find Denise and Jackie . The girls belonged to The Breakwater Club in Deal . They had a freshwater pool and a snack bar , unlike Allenhurst . They had a shuffleboard court , and Anthony loved shuffleboard . Because of Denise , they would always do laps in the swimming pool . Denise was big on self-improvement and was always pointing out the benefits of their various activities . Swimming laps helped both your muscle strength and cardiovascular capacity . She applied this logic to other things . For instance , midget-wrestling was good for learning how to defend yourself . Having to say " safety " after you burped taught you to think fast , or not burp . Playing shuffleboard honed your hand eye coordination . Weaving through people while jogging on the boardwalk was good for quickness . Anthony found this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Once while star-watching , Anthony said , " It 's teaching us to see better . " Jay said , " You think I really care how well I see ? " One afternoon they were all getting ice-cream cones and milkshakes . The nicest thing about The Breakwater was the charge account . Denise and Jackie charged everything to their parents . When Jackie 's younger sister , Lizzy , got her cone , she took one lick and the ice cream fell . Anthony happened to be standing right beside her . Without thinking , he reached out with his left hand and caught the ice cream . Denise said , " Wow , you 're like Mr. Lightningfast Reflex . " He placed the scoop back on Lizzy 's cone . An hour later they went body-surfing in the ocean , having conveniently forgotten that one week before the water was filled with flesh-eating bacteria . Anthony tended to get cold fast . After five minutes he was shivering uncontrollably . He caught a wave and missed the crest , so he got crashed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him against the sand , twisted him here and there and then pulled back . He rose and trudged out of the water . He could feel sand inside his bathing suit . So he walked over to the tidal pool by the jetty , and there he crouched in the shallow water to get the sand out . He saw a blue-claw crab move past his feet and tried to catch it . He saw the starfish that always magically appeared in the tidal pools . He felt a tap on his left shoulder , turned around , and there was Jackie . She said , " I followed you . " Anthony said , " I see that . " She stared in that sexy way that always made him want to know what she was thinking . So then he said it . He said , " Jackie , what are you thinking ? " She said , " Guess . " He said , " You want to look for crabs ? " Jackie said , " No . " She stepped into the tidal pool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared and then Jackie was beside him . " I want to kiss you , " she said . " That was so cool when you saved my sister 's ice cream . " " You want to kiss me because I saved an ice cream ? " She never answered . They started kissing as they stood in the tidal pool . He 'd never kissed anyone , though clearly Jackie had . Her touch was practiced , tender and delicate . She kept on pressing the tip of her tongue to his , then pulling back and saying , " You taste good . " They kissed in the tidal pool for about five minutes . He was just starting to press his tongue in far enough to touch her fillings . Then Denise , Bradley , and Jay ambushed them . They did n't see their three friends until they were running at them through the shallow water . " Break it up ! " Denise yelled . She jumped on Jackie . Soon they were all tag-team midget-wrestling . Jackie and Anthony teamed up and went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five Democratic presidents . That day they also invented a new move they called " the starfish . " To do the move required a tidal pool and abundant starfish . During a pin , the winner quickly grabbed a starfish and rammed it into the loser 's face . Just before Labor Day weekend , Anthony 's mother got arrested . It was a weekday . Anthony 's father and Douglas Berkowitz were each at home that night in Livingston , which was an hour 's drive from Allenhurst without traffic . Sometimes they stayed there on weekday nights instead of braving the Parkway after work . Both Jess and Claudia got tanked at a bar called Tides , which was in Belmar . On the way home , Jess was pulled over in Asbury . She was arrested for drunk driving and locked up in an Asbury Park jail cell . All four children were there when Claudia returned in a kind of frenzy . She said the officers acted like rough jerks and had left her standing on the roadside . Clearly as plastered as Jess Rubin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled over if she drove . Michael arrived an hour later , after receiving his wife 's phone call from the jail house . He explained the situation to his children . Then he and Claudia went out . Anthony did n't know what to feel . He kept on thinking that his mother was somehow part of a Bruce Springsteen song . She was behind bars in the Asbury Park jail house . She 'd had a cancer scare and would n't laugh at Yiddish constellations . Maybe it was n't as mythical as " Jungleland , " but it still seemed too confusing to be reality . He also knew that his mother would freak out when she got home . The children sat around that evening playing Scrabble . They watched The Sound of Music on TV . They played Monopoly , the beach wayusing sea glass in place of the plastic houses and hotels . They had lost most of the parts long ago , one night in Livingston when Dani got mad and threw the whole game at her brother 's head . Three hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bail would not be posted until the morning . Anthony asked if this meant his mom would spend the whole night in a jail cell . His father said , " Unfortunately , yes . " Claudia told them not to worry . Dani yelled , " Why ! It 's your fault that she 's in there ! " " It 's no one 's fault , " said their father , and made Dani apologize to Claudia . Still there was something completely off about the way Claudia was acting . Anthony sensed that she was secretly quite thrilled with his mother 's fate . He could n't read his dad as easily , but he seemed calmer than he should have been . They left the room , sat in the kitchen , and drank vodka . Later that evening , Anthony saw them leaving . He was out on the porch with Jay . They had their star charts . It was the first starry sky they 'd had in weeks . He saw them skip down the stairs and turn right onto the sand below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " Going to see the Yiddish constellations ? " His father stopped and looked up . He said , " Anthony ? " He said , " Hi . I 'm out here watching stars with Jay . " " I 'm taking a little walk with Claudia , " said his father . " Just down the beach , to calm our nerves . Then we have to go get the other car . " He said , " Okay , " and understood for the first time that they were guilty . He watched them go and turned to Jay . He said , " Our parents are definitely screwing . " Jay said , " I know , " and shined a flashlight on his star chart . He turned it off and then looked up at the sky . " It took you this long to figure it all out ? " " My mom 's in jail , " Anthony said . " It 's like she 's locked up while they do this . " Jay said , " She is locked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shut the light off and then pointed . " Right there 's Pegasus , " he said . " Do you still plan to get that bank ? " Anthony fell asleep that night before his father returned with Claudia . He tried to slough the whole thing off as a bad dream . At about six he heard a car pull up . He heard the front door opening and closing . Soon he could hear his parents ' voices . When he went down , they were sitting in the kitchen . His mother 's elbows rested on the table and her forehead was pressed into her hands . She looked up and said , " Honey ? " Anthony stepped into the kitchen and said , " Hi . Are you okay ? " " Fine , " she said . " It was a very comfortable jail cell . " " We 're talking , " said his father . He said , " I have to clean the beach . " He went upstairs to get dressed . He woke up Jay and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That morning Bradley did n't show up . For a few minutes they waited by the lifeguard chair . Then Jay suggested they get to it before a garbage tide floated in . The found the usual plastic bags and beer cans . They stamped down seafoam in the places where it looked gross . They found a tennis ball in the tidal pool by the jetty . Anthony picked it up and noticed dozens of starfish lying placidly beneath the shallow water . He said , " Hey , look . They 're making a constellation . " Jay said , " It 's Miriam , the Kvetch . " " You mean Sophie . " He said , " Whatever . " Jay reached down into the water and grabbed a starfish . " Do n't even think it , " Anthony said . Jay said , " Think what ? " and was all over him in a second . They midget-wrestled . Jay kicked wildly . Anthony got hold of his arms pinned him easily . He grabbed a starfish and pressed it to Jay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm lying on twenty starfish ! I might kill them ! " He pushed Jay 's face under the water . For one strange instant he truly felt like drowning him . Somehow Jay managed to kick him in the groin . Jay squirmed away , brought his head up , and screamed , " You psycho ! " Anthony said , " What 's your problem ? I just dunked you . " Jay coughed some water , then looked up and yelled , " You psycho with a totally psycho mother ! " " I 'll fucking kill you ! " Anthony yelled , and lunged down at him . Jay rolled away in the shallow water . He grabbed his garbage bag , got up , and darted out of the tidal pool . He yelled , " You 'll never fucking catch me , you psycho idiot ! " " I 'm sorry ! " Anthony yelled , suddenly realizing he was a psycho idiot . Jay yelled , " I do n't accept your apology ! " He turned and ran down the beach with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Anthony the finger . He held it up over his shoulder while he ran . Around nine , when Anthony got back , he learned his family would be leaving the Jersey Shore that afternoon . His father had already begun packing . He talked to Dani , who said Mom had a nervous breakdown while making pancakes . She was now sitting out on the jetty . Anthony went outside and found his father cleaning out the car . He said , " It 's Labor Day . We ca n't stay here three more days ? " His father turned and said , " You know how your mother gets . " " But I ca n't go , " Anthony said . " I met ... a girlfriend . I also have n't cashed in my Skee-Ball win tickets . " " You have the day , " his father said . " We leave for Livingston at five . " Even though Jackie was n't really his girlfriend , Anthony searched for her , maniacally . In the course of just that morning , he jogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panic but reminded himself of how he was improving his heart and lungs . After the third time he ran home and called Bradley , who said that Jackie must have gone yachting with her family . He yelled , " Since when does she have a yacht ! " Bradley said , " Hey , take it easy . I 'm just joking . " He packed his suitcase and made a final trip up to The Breakwater . He left a note with one of the club 's cabana boys . The note explained that he unexpectedly had to leave , but that he hoped they would talk soon . He gave his phone number and home address in Livingston . He signed his name and at the bottom wrote : Please call ! In his last hour at the Jersey Shore , Anthony went alone to the Asbury Park boardwalk . He 'd counted out all of his win tickets and had tied them with rubber bands . Had he not tried to drown Jay that same morning , he knew Jay might have lent him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had disappeared with his mom and brother . They had all gone to see a drive-in movie . At the arcade , he told the man he had four hundred fifty-three tickets . He asked for the winged-horse bank , which cost five hundred . The man suggested he take a frog bank , which cost less . He said , " It 's ugly . Ca n't you just give me the winged horse ? " The man said , " No . " " But I 've been saving for it all summer . " " We 're not a Burger King , " the man said . " You ca n't always have it your way . " In the end , he wound up handing all his tickets to a long-haired boy who passed by on the boardwalk . He looked to be eight or nine and held a hockey stick , which was why Anthony had noticed him in the first place . He jogged right up to the boy and said , " Do you play Skee-Ball ? " The boy nodded . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have time to cash them in . " The boy said , " How come you do n't just keep them for next summer ?

He even has a constellation . You 'd need a star chart . " The boy just nodded , then Anthony took off . He could see Allenhurst Beach ahead of him . He smelled the tangy smell of ocean , which made him sad . He jogged with high steps , for no reason the way he sometimes did with Jay when they were imitating football . Two girls made fun of him as he passed , but he did n't care that he looked ridiculous . He knew that running this way improved his balance . He also knew that he would never be coming back .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
