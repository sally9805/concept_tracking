When we look out for society 's youngest members , we pave the way for a better future . COMPASSION ON CANVAS Like many great charities , THE MEMORY PROJECT started as a crazy idea . In 2004 , a year out of the University of Wisconsin , twenty-one-year-old Ben Schumaker could not stop thinking about the children he had met during a postgraduation volunteer experience at a Guatemalan orphanage . He was particularly disturbed that these parentless ( and penniless ) kids would reach adulthood without keepsakes to connect them with their youth . Photograph : photograph by Arlene Raub In July 2004 he dreamed up a way to remedy the problem . Reaching out to high schools near his home , in Madison , Wisconsin , Schumaker persuaded dozens of art teachers to have their pupils , like Le'ad Rosenblith , above , pick up brushes to paint the likeness of a child they 'd meet only through a photograph . The program has grown rapidly since then , and during the school year that just ended , a whopping 8,000 artists created portraits of orphaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumaker is eager to sign on as many participating orphanages and U.S. high schools as possible . The goal is for each child to receive a new portrait every year . It 's the sort of gift they 'll hold dear long after they have children of their own  --  proof positive that a picture is worth a thousand words . thememoryproject.org . T.P.F. FROM THE HEART Petra Nemcova ( below ) is a supermodel with heart . The Czech beauty and Sports Illustrated swimsuit-issue favorite was vacationing with her boyfriend , photographer Simon Atlee , in Thailand when the tsunami struck , in 2004 .

SUZANNE GANNON SOWING THE SEEDS Alice Waters is a famous chef and former teacher intent on improving public education . New Orleans is a city where chefs are revered and whose public schools are ranked among the lowest in the nation . So when Waters responded to the ravages of Hurricane Katrina by choosing New Orleans as the site of an EDIBLE SCHOOLYARD , it was an ideal pairing of talent with need . The Crescent City operation is a replication of the first Edible Schoolyard , which Waters opened in 1996 at a middle school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chez Panisse . The new outpost , at the Samuel J. Green Charter School , in the 13th Ward , is located on a third of an acre in a field on school property .
