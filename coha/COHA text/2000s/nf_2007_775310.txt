Prologue My grandmother made the world 's best rhubarb pies and sewed extraordinary silk garments with exquisite craftsmanship worthy of a French couturier . Raised to devote her all to marriage and family , she worshipped her talented husband , doted on her children , and baked homemade bread whose enticing aroma drew everyone to the kitchen . Although she lived for nearly eighty years , she never worked outside the home or held a paying job . // Such latter-day paragons of traditional femininity often make people nostalgic for bygone times , but even then , the truth was frequently a lot darker than the champions of conventional gender roles like to admit . Although my grandmother 's life adhered faithfully to the old-fashioned stereotypes so often held up as a modern ideal , the result was a disaster , not only for her but also for her children and relatives . // In 1932 , when my mother was nine years old , her father left the family for his mistress , a stylish black-haired beauty unencumbered by the mundane burdens of domesticity . For my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional devastation of losing her husband was exacerbated by the dizzying plunge into poverty that accompanied it . My grandfather was an architect who had done pioneering work with men like Philip Johnson and R. Buckminster Fuller , but employment was hard to come by during the worst years of the Depression , and he soon defaulted on his financial obligations to his wife and children . // Left with no means of support , my grandmother considered getting a job , but her straitlaced sisters pressured her not to do so . Firmly in thrall to the Victorian concept of " separate spheres " that divided the world according to gender , they believed that men should be the breadwinners and that women-or at least ladies-should not work outside the home . If my grandmother began supporting herself , her sisters warned , that would absolve her husband of his familial responsibilities , and then he would never return to his wife and children . Best to wait until he got tired of " that trollop , " as my grandmother and her sisters referred to the Other Woman ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardworking schoolteacher with considerably more modern ideas about women 's place in the world ) . // The loss of her husband left my grandmother virtually paralyzed with grief ; according to family lore , she simply went to bed for two years . My mother 's older brother was soon out of the house , so my mother was left on her own to care for my deeply depressed grandmother . In addition to the emotional toll that entailed , the rest of my mother 's childhood was blighted by one financial crisis after another as she and my grandmother were evicted from a series of increasingly shabby apartments , unable to keep up with the rent . // My grandmother 's family owned a great deal of land out west , but as a woman she was deemed unable to manage her own affairs , so her only brother assumed control of her share of the family assets . Over time , he apparently " managed " my grandmother 's property out of her name and into his own . As a result , she was forced to depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more precise , their wealthy husbands-for support . // My grandfather 's abdication of financial responsibility also torpedoed my mother 's dream of attending Vassar . She was elated at being accepted , and my grandfather had promised to pay the tuition . But the day before my mother left for college , she learned that her father had n't paid for her enrollment-and would n't be doing so . By then my great-uncles were all tired of being saddled with financial responsibility for their sister-in-law , so my mother went to work and supported them both while putting herself through school , eventually graduating from Barnard College . // My grandmother spent the next forty years mourning the loss of her marriage and waiting for her ex-husband to come back to her , even though he had long since wed his mistress . Until the day she died , my grandmother clung to the illusion that her husband would eventually return to her . In all those years , she never looked at another man , politely but firmly turning away all suitors . Nor did she ever question the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own potential . As far as she was concerned , marriage was " for time and all eternity , " just as her wedding ceremony had promised , and her role in life was as a wife , even when there was no husband around . // In the meantime , my mother had met and married my father , giving up her budding career as an actress in order to stay home and have her own family . But when she asked him to take over the financial support of my grandmother , my father declined , unwilling to shoulder that long-term responsibility . // So when I was five and my brother was four , my mother took a job at a publishing company where she worked her way up from secretary to copy editor to children's-book editor . From her own earnings , she paid her mother to take care of my brother and me after school . This was fine with us ; our grandma made up wonderful stories and sewed elaborate costumes for the plays we wrote and staged in our basement . My mother never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't think she ever had a guilty conscience about going to the office every day , because we adored being with our grandma . // Our mother left the house every morning with a briefcase and commuted into the city with all the men in their gray flannel suits . In an era when such choices were rare , I was the only one of my friends whose mother was a professional woman . But in other respects , she functioned like a typical 1950s housewife . Every night she came home and made an elaborate meal for our family-no TV dinners for us ! - along with baking cookies for the next day 's Girl Scout meeting , cleaning the house , washing and ironing our clothes for school , and helping us with our homework while my father dozed in front of the television set . // Although she undoubtedly did n't get enough sleep , my mother never complained . To the contrary ; she told us all the time how lucky she felt . After the insecurity and humiliation of her childhood , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . She loved being a mother , but she also enjoyed her work , which she talked about with enthusiasm . As a result , it never occurred to me that a woman could n't have both . // My mother supported my grandmother until she died , shortly before her eightieth birthday , still waiting for her husband to come back . He died soon afterward , leaving the " trollop , " by then a sweet white-haired little old lady who had been his wife for more than four decades , as his widow . // Although I understood that my grandmother had spent most of her life quietly nursing a broken heart , the larger significance of this family history was lost on me until my mother heard about The Feminine Mystique and gave it to me . " Read this , " she said , so I did . // That book had such a profound effect on American culture that Betty Friedan used the most frequent comment she heard from her readers as the title of a subsequent book : It Changed My Life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feminine Mystique was published , and it helped to guide my views and choices from then on . By the time I was a teenager , my parents had moved from Manhattan 's Upper East Side to a Westchester suburb , and I was beginning to notice how much truth there was in Friedan 's observations about affluent women trapped in unsatisfying domestic lives . Palpably unhappy , many of my friends ' stay-at-home mothers were doubly wounded when their marriages broke up as soon as their kids left for college . My parents were among the few couples we knew who stayed together . // In retrospect , it 's hard to parse the varied influences that shaped my life . How much of a role did one revolutionary book play in determining my future ? How much did I learn from my own family history ? Since my coming-of-age coincided with the blossoming of modern feminism , how many of my choices were simply a product of the exhilarating times I grew up in during the 1960s and ' 70s , when the very air seemed electric with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as conservatives railed against the changes being wrought by the women 's movement , it was clear to me that the conventional social roles had n't necessarily worked out very well for the women who actually lived them . When my grandmother was abandoned by her husband and swindled out of her share of the family fortune by her brother , the prescribed gender roles of her day rendered her powerless to deal effectively with either calamity . Because those roles were so confining , she never replaced her identity as a wife and mother with an independent life that might have consoled and sustained her during the decades she spent alone . // I certainly knew that my mother had been forced to go to work by my grandmother 's lifelong economic dependency , which burdened so many other family members over the years . I knew that my father had refused to assume the financial support of my grandmother-but I also knew that this abdication of patriarchal responsibility had galvanized my mother into forging a career that proved to be enormously gratifying . // In the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania , my mother and I went to Europe for three weeks . My father had worked for the same company since he was a young man , and his life savings were invested in its stock . That company had just been taken over by a conglomerate whose stock price suddenly plummeted while my mother and I were away . By the time we got home , the stock was worth next to nothing . Our family 's substantial net worth had simply vanished . // My mother could n't believe that my father had just watched this catastrophe unfold , doing nothing to salvage our assets . How could he have been so passive when confronted by a colossal disaster that would forever alter our lives ? When the stock price began its nosedive , why had n't he sold our shares ? My father , who assumed that it would eventually recover , had no answer . Nor did he have an income ; nearly two decades older than my mother , he had recently retired and was no longer earning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ivy League education . But my mother was still working , so she became the breadwinner , as she had been for her own mother . Her income kept our family afloat when all else failed . // As a child , I did n't really focus on the destructive role that women 's economic dependency had played in this linked chain of family dramas-but I surely got the message that you could n't depend on men to take care of you . I also understood that when you asserted control over your own life , it made you strong and free . // As a professional woman during the 1950s and ' 60s , my mother was ahead of her time in many ways . But she was also a mother , and so-conforming obediently to the classic models for female behavior-she adjusted her work schedule according to what she thought was best for her husband and children at a given moment , as so many women continue to do today . The end result was that despite a long career , she suffered a significant financial penalty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . // When I entered seventh grade at the age of ten , she left her job to become a full-time mom again , because she had heard from other mothers that junior high school was a difficult transition for many kids . Having started school early and then skipped a grade , I was at least two years younger than most of my classmates , so my mother was particularly concerned about how I would adapt to an adolescent environment . // As it turned out , I was fine , and after a year as a stay-at-home mother in an empty house , she went back to work . A decade later , when I got engaged to my first husband , she left that job as well- " to plan your wedding , " she said . Six months of intensive planning ensued ; the wedding was beautiful , and when it was over , my mother got another job . // Even after her children were grown , however , she continued to subordinate her career to what she perceived as her family 's needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be more available to spend time with her increasingly elderly husband . Although she had been a children's-book editor for many years , she decided to return to the job of copy editor , which paid less but had predictable hours that enabled her to leave the office promptly at 5:00 P.M. and hurry home . She spent the final phase of her working life in the same job she had held during the 1950s. // But my mother paid a high price for these interruptions to her professional life . During a career in book publishing that spanned more than thirty-five years , she worked for three major companies , spending at least a decade at each . As a result , she received three different pensions when she retired . One is for $161.82 a month ; one earns her $183.45 a month ; and the third brings in $236.75 a month . The grand total of my mother 's pension income is $582.02 a month . My father died in 1985 , so my mother subsists on her pensions , which add up to $6,984.24 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , this does not provide a lavish lifestyle . // My own professional history has been very different . Like my mother , I first went to work at the age of sixteen ; I held down a full-time job during my senior year in college and began my career at the age of twenty . But I 've never taken more than a weekend off between jobs since then . Because there have been no interruptions to my labor-force participation since I came of age , my work history looks much more like that of a man in terms of continuous employment , steadily increasing compensation , and the resulting investment and retirement- planning opportunities . Over the years , my career has become a significant ongoing asset , rather than a temporary source of income that I dip into and drop out of in response to personal considerations . I 'm not rich , and you never know what the future might bring , but I am far better prepared to withstand its economic challenges than either my mother or my grandmother ever was . // These days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices , the echoes of the past reverberate like a Greek chorus in the background-one that many of them seem unable to hear . Occasionally a powerful voice will break through , trying urgently to communicate the dangers that can lie ahead like jagged rocks underneath calm waters , waiting silently to sink an unwary ship . // On New Year 's Day 2006 , The New York Times published an essay by Terry Martin Hekker , a mother of five who had once crusaded as a self-appointed spokesperson for the joys of being a full-time homemaker . More than a quarter of a century ago , Hekker wrote a book called Ever Since Adam and Eve and made a national tour : " I spoke to rapt audiences about the importance of being there for your children as they grew up , of the satisfactions of ' making a home , ' preparing family meals and supporting your hard-working husband , " she recalled . " So I was predictably stunned and devastated when , on our 40th wedding anniversary , my husband presented me with a divorce . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n , Hekker sold her engagement ring to pay for repairs to the roof of her house . " When I filed my first nonjoint tax return , it triggered the shocking notification that I had become eligible for food stamps , " she reported . // Hekker was able to parlay her involvement with the local village board into a stint as mayor of her community- " a challenging , full-time job that paid a whopping annual salary of $8,000 , " she noted dryly . How many of today 's affluent wives would welcome the prospect of spending their later years trying to live on eight thousand dollars a year ? // Looking back on her life , Hekker-the grandmother of twelve-said she does n't regret marrying her husband , because the result was the family she cherishes . What she regrets is having sacrificed her ability to support herself adequately . // Will younger generations learn to heed such cautionary tales ? Not unless more women speak out to tell them why and show them how . //           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
