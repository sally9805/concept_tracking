<p> Every day , 17 Americans die of organ failure . In Israel , the average wait for a kidney transplant is four years . In response , a global gray market has bloomed . In India , for example , poor sellers are quickly matched with sick buyers from Taiwan . Critics call it " transplant tourism . " Proponents say the market is meeting a need . <p> The Monitor follows three men : an unemployed Brazilian and an ailing Israeli , as well as a South African investigator who helped bust an organ-trafficking ring . <p> The case raises anew hard legal and ethical questions , such as : Who owns our bodies ? Should it be illegal to sell an organ if it could save someone 's life ? What is the government 's role in protecting two vulnerable groups - the poor , who are willingly exploited , and the sick , who are desperate for healing ? <p> On a warm afternoon in Recife , a city on Brazil 's northeastern coast , Hernani Gomes da Silva sits alone in the Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicament . He is 32 years old and still lives in his mother 's two-room house . Rain comes in through the roof , and cockroaches and rats scuttle across the cement floor . He has three kids , a wife who loathes him , and a mistress 20 years his senior . He is unemployed with no money , no skills , and a criminal record . The future is bleak . <p> Suddenly the words " we pay people $ 6,000 " leap out at him from behind . His radar clicks on . <p> " I do n't mean to eavesdrop , " he says , turning to the bald man sitting at a nearby table . " Were you talking about earning money from transplants ? " He has heard of others in Recife who have sold their organs and ca n't believe his good fortune . <p> " Yes , " says the man . <p> " Which organ ? " Hernani asks . <p> " The kidney . Why , are you interested ? " <p> " Of course I 'm interested . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks . <p> " O-positive , " says Hernani . <p> The man nods - it 's the most compatible blood type . It 's 2002 and Hernani has passed the first test for selling a kidney to an organization that will stretch across three continents ; make hundreds of thousands of dollars for the people behind it ; and rouse the interest of police , politicians , ethicists , and doctors around the world . <p> Soon Hernani is walking home , dreaming of a motorbike and a roof that does n't leak . <p> * * * <p> More than 5,000 miles away across an ocean , Arie Pach , a stout Israeli lawyer in failing health , sees his future flash before him . It makes him shudder . <p> As he heads to an appointment on the sixth floor of Jerusalem 's Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital , he walks past the dialysis ward . Below the glare of fluorescent lights , the thin , feeble-looking patients sit in special armchairs hooked up to oven-sized machines that click and whir and simulate the job of the human kidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life-preserving process for people whose kidneys have failed , but they have to be connected roughly three hours at a time , three days a week . <p> In February 2002 , Arie 's doctors told him his kidneys were beginning to falter . By early 2003 , he 's had minor surgery to prepare for dialysis , but he is already formulating plans to avoid the ward . " I do n't want to be one of those people with big needles in my arm , getting my blood changed in and out of the machine like a car going for an oil change , " he thinks . <p> Then there 's the expense of dialysis to the healthcare system - about $ 45,000 to $ 50,000 per year . And only some 10 percent of dialysis patients live more than 10 years , according to the US National Center for Health Statistics . Arie has too many things left to do in life . He loves to travel abroad with his wife . One of his two sons will marry this summer . To see any grandchildren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors warn him that his blood could soon start to become toxic . They give him two choices : dialysis or a kidney transplant . <p> * * * <p> In the seaside resort city of Durban , South Africa , private investigator Johan Wessels is working in his home office , plinking away at the computer keyboard . The phone rings . It 's a woman from the health department . She wants to know if he 'd be willing to work on a case under something called the Human Tissue Act . <p> In 24 years as a police detective and private investigator , Johan has tackled all kinds of cases - smuggling , embezzlement , bribery . He 's achieved a 98 percent conviction rate . But he 's never heard about this act and has little idea what he 's getting into as he says yes . <p> Hanging up , he yells to his wife , Carol , in the kitchen . " That was the health department . They want me to investigate some case about human tissues . " <p> His partner of 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning about you getting more work , " she says . Both are " reborn Christians . " They read the Bible daily and sit up front at church on Sundays . <p> His curiosity piqued , Johan is faxed a copy of South Africa 's Human Tissue Act and scans it . <p> Sect. 1 : " Tissue means ... any flesh , bone , organ , gland , or body fluid ... " Sect. 28 : " No person ... may receive any payment in ... the ... acquisition ... of any tissue ... " Section 33 : Violators " shall be ... liable ... to a fine not exceeding 2,000 Rand or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year ... " <p> One year in jail or a fine of about $ 300 . This thing has " no teeth , " Johan thinks . Maybe that 's why they 're buying and selling organs in South Africa . <p> It 's June 2003 , and Johan is embarking on what will become one of the toughest cases of his career - not only a test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious values he holds dear . <p> Hernani goes to South Africa <p> Hernani has big dreams for the $ 6,000 he 's expecting to get for one of his kidneys . But he also has doubts . One day as he 's walking home - wondering if the South Africans will take a lung or cornea , too , or just abandon him in a country where he ca n't speak the language - he bumps into a friend who 's driving a shiny white Volkswagen . He 's heard through the grapevine that this friend is one of dozens from Recife who went to South Africa and came back alive . The early ones got $ 10,000 for their kidneys , a fortune in a neighborhood where many earn the minimum wage - about $ 1,000 a year . <p> Hernani gets in the car . He is not normally the inquisitive type , but today he pelts his friend with questions . <p> " How much did you get paid ? " he asks . <p> " Do they pay in advance ? " <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation like ? " <p> " Do they take care of you ? " <p> " Will I be OK ? " <p> The friend says all the right things . Ten minutes later , Hernani gets out of the car , his mind at rest . He is going to South Africa to sell his kidney . <p> * * * <p> In the months since they met in Egipcio 's , Hernani and the little bald man - he calls him Captain Ivan - have become fast friends . Ivan Bonifacio da Silva , a retired police officer , has taken Hernani under his wing , patiently explaining how the kidney switch works , and assuaging his lingering concerns . <p> He 's also been shepherding him into a whole new world . He tells Hernani where to get the tests to prove he 's healthy enough for the operation . He 's with Hernani when he gets the passport that will allow him to leave Brazil for the first time in his life . And in October 2002 , on the eve of Hernani 's trip to Durban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him there is another $ 5,500 waiting for him when he gets home . <p> Six thousand dollars . It 's somewhere near the average going rate for kidneys in today 's global organ trade . Palestinian men who sold their kidneys in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq after the first Gulf War got just $ 500 to $ 1,000 . They helped make Iraq the organ-trading hub of the Arab world until the latest war broke out . In the slums of Manila , where corneas , livers , and lungs are also offered for sale , kidneys fetch about $ 2,000 , according to Nancy Scheper-Hughes , cofounder of Organs Watch , a group at the University of California , Berkeley , that tracks the trade . Some Israeli organ donors have gotten $ 20,000 , she says . And a few American sellers have gotten $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 for their kidneys . <p> But $ 500 is more than Hernani has ever held in his hands . Captain Ivan tells him to make sure Daisy , Hernani 's wife , has enough for when he 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly has to be told twice . Within an hour , he 's walking through the sliding doors of the Shopping Recife mall and into a new life . The lights are bright and the giant windows are filled with personal beer kegs , colorful shirts , and tiny cameras that seem to seduce him , whispering : You 've got money now , you can afford it , come in , buy me . <p> Hernani quickly succumbs to the mall 's sirens . He buys five or six polo shirts . He buys a new pair of lace-up shoes . He buys two pairs of jeans , tripling the number of long pants in his wardrobe . He goes to the food court and fulfills a lifelong dream of buying a cappuccino . At the supermarket he fills his cart with rice , beans , bread , milk , eggs , and the ultimate luxury food - meat . For about $ 2 he buys enough beef to feed his family for a month . <p> This is just the beginning , he thinks , as he sits down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different now . I am somebody . I 'm a consumer . <p> * * * <p> But when he opens the metal door to his house just after midnight , he realizes money ca n't change everything . Daisy is lying on the carpet they call their bed . She 's angry . She knows he 's been to see his mistress , Antonia . And she knows he has spent most of the money on himself , even though it was supposed to be the down payment on their new life . Yet no matter how much she has come to detest him over the past few years , she ca n't stop herself from worrying . <p> " Do n't go , " she tells him as he lies down beside her . " You do n't know what might happen . They could do anything , take anything . You do n't know who they are or what they want . " <p> " Shut up , " Hernani barks . " Let me go to sleep . " <p> " It could be a trap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out alive . " <p> Actually , in this brave new world of kidney selling , donors rarely die . But Daisy 's fears are n't totally unfounded . In India , about 2,000 people sell a kidney each year . One study there in 2002 found 86 percent of organ sellers saying they had significant declines in their health in the three years after surgery . In the eastern European nation of Moldova , some 300 peasants sold their kidneys between 1999 and 2002 . A study by Organs Watch found 79 percent of Moldovan donors with health problems in the months and years after the procedure . <p> But in the darkness of their house that night , with the promise of a payday to beat all paydays , Hernani ignores his wife 's anxious pleading . " Daisy , I 'm doing this , " he says , cursing her . More harsh words are exchanged , and she flees to the next room to sleep with her son . <p> The next morning he pecks her on the cheek , slips quietly out the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hernani lands in the lush , hilly city of Durban , which sits on the Indian Ocean . How different and luxurious things are here , he thinks . The house where his hosts keep him and several other Brazilian kidney donors is enormous . The living room alone is bigger than his whole house back home . There 's even a hot tub . An interpreter stays with them all day , and a facilitator buys them a CD player so they can dance around the living room to Brazilian songs that remind them of home . Sometimes the hosts take them out to dinner . Hernani , who rarely has enough money to buy even pork , tries ostrich meat . <p> October 2002 blends into November . Mostly , they spend their days lying about the house , waiting for the call . When it finally comes , Hernani is whisked off to St. Augustine 's Hospital , a sprawling modern complex set high on a green hillside overlooking the ocean . He and the others are , after all , here for business . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that police say were brought to South Africa between 2001 and 2003 . The syndicate was run , police say , by an Israeli named Ilan Perry . He and the other organizers were making hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits . They probably picked South Africa because it has top-notch medical facilities and one of the world 's best transplant-success rates . It also has weak laws regulating the sale of human organs . <p> Hernani has signed lots of forms , including one that says he 's " related " to the man to whom he 's about to give his kidney . Finally he meets this man - an Israeli named Amiram Aharoni - for the first time . Walking into the room , it 's then that Hernani understands the magnitude of what he 's about to do . Mr. Aharoni is all swollen and pale . He cries when he sees Hernani . He 's too weak to lift himself up . But his wife passes along their message with a tender hug . " You are part of our family now , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our flesh and blood . " <p> The operation takes place on Nov. 26 , 2002 , and lasts several hours . Lying in two nearby operating rooms , Hernani and Aharoni undergo surgery at the same time . Hernani has three surgeons operating on him because of the complexity of the procedure , which sometimes involves removing a rib . <p> When Aharoni wakes up , he has a fresh kidney and a new lease on life . When Hernani comes to , he feels a tightness where the wound has been stitched shut . But three days later , when he finally boards the plane back to Brazil , he is a happy man . He is going to be rich . <p> * * * <p> That joy fades fast as he arrives back at his mother 's house in Recife . It 's been almost 24 hours since his plane landed , and Daisy is scowling at him . She suspects he 's been to see Antonia . She 's both relieved and depressed to see him alive and back in her life . She 's tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really care about the three children jumping around the street - or about Daisy herself , who dropped out of school at 14 to set up a home with him . Even after weeks on the other side of the world , the man taking a red bicycle out of the taxi does n't even look at her . <p> " Luiza , go and get yourself ready . We 're going into town to get you a bicycle , " he shouts to his 9-year-old daughter as he hands the new bike to his son , Hernandes . Then he turns his back and walks toward the local plaza . <p> He 's determined to have some fun . After all , he has money in his pocket - $ 5,500 in crisp new $ 100 bills handed to him by Captain Ivan under the table at a fast-food restaurant near a local branch of Citibank . <p> For someone who has been poor all his life , money is to be spent , not saved or budgeted . And spend it he does . In the first few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof , the floor , the walls , the windows , and the wiring in his mother 's house . He uses $ 1,600 to pay off her credit cards . Another $ 1,200 buys him a brand new Honda CG 125 motorcycle , which he insists the dealer deliver to his house so his neighbors can see . On New Year 's Eve , he buys Daisy a new blouse and skirt . He figures that leaves him somewhere between $ 1,000 and $ 2,000 to spend on drink and other women . Life is good . <p> Paying a healthy stranger <p> While Hernani is busy blowing through his money , in Israel Arie Pach is hoping to avoid a life tied to a dialysis machine . But he 's running out of options . He 's been ruminating over them since 1995 when doctors first detected a problem with his kidneys . He knows that patients who get kidneys tend to live longer than those on dialysis . So he considers turning to his wife or sons for a kidney . Since they come in pairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife and oldest son have the wrong blood type . His youngest son is a match , but he has health problems similar to Arie 's . So getting a kidney from a related donor is out . <p> Another possibility : Signing up for Israel 's national waiting list , which already has more than 500 people on it . But the wait time can be as long as four years for someone of Arie 's age - those under 18 get priority - which means most go onto dialysis . For religious reasons , Israel 's cadaver donation rate is relatively low , although its rate of donation among living relatives is above average . And anyway , organs from live donors are more effective than cadaveric ones . <p> So Arie and Mary , his wife of 36 years , feel they have no other alternative . They 're left to consider paying a healthy stranger for a kidney . Mary has been an operating-room nurse for more than 25 years . She encourages Arie to find a living donor . " If you go for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your body is all worn out , " she says . " If you do it before you get to dialysis , you have a much better chance of the surgery being successful . " <p> Buying a kidney in Israel is against Health Ministry regulations , but there 's no penalty associated with the rule - yet . As in many countries , the legal ground is soft . Going abroad for a kidney operation is perfectly legitimate , and in such cases questions are rarely asked about how the organ was obtained . Even under a new proposal that would punish brokers , recipients would not be prosecuted because they 're victims of failing health and opportunistic organ brokers , says Meir Broder , legal adviser to the Health Ministry . <p> For Arie , who has spent a lifetime practicing law , the ethics of a kidney purchase are still complicated . He does n't want , for instance , to exploit a poor person who 's just trying to feed a family . Yet he 's torn . <p> " Everyone is the boss of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away one of his own kidneys , I ca n't see why it should n't be done , " he says . " There has to be informed consent . " <p> Then there 's the religious element . Arie and Mary are n't particularly devout , but they discuss the guidance Judaism offers . Arie finally concludes , " There really is nothing holy except for God and human life , " and since " donating an organ is saving a life , " it 's entirely ethical . <p> Religious beliefs often figure in decisions about organ trading . They 're invoked both to encourage and discourage it . The Old Testament story of Hagar bearing a child for Abraham ( because his wife , Sarah , is " barren " ) , is often cited as the first case of surrogate motherhood . Some people use this scripture to justify paying someone to be a surrogate for an organ , says Dr. Scheper-Hughes of Organs Watch . Or as one Israeli doctor said to her , " God performed the first transplant " when he took a rib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles , too , there 's the belief that " your body is a gift from God , " says Scheper-Hughes , " or that you have use-rights over your body , but that it belongs to God . " <p> Yet one reason Israelis rarely donate organs after death is that many Jews believe the body is sacred , and should be whole at the time of burial . Orthodox Jews believe that the deceased should be intact for the Resurrection they believe will follow the coming of the Messiah . But views are shifting . <p> " If someone needs to save his life and the only way to motivate someone to help him do that is by financial incentive , then I do n't think they should prevent people from doing that in order to save lives , " says Robert Berman , the founder of the New York-based Halachic Organ Donor Society , which has enlisted prominent rabbis to encourage donation . <p> " The fact is that people are dying and that there are not enough organs going around to save their lives , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donation is categorically prohibited by Jewish law . It is not . Jewish law supports saving lives . " <p> Meanwhile , after many conversations , Arie and Mary agree they 're making the right choice . " This decision , " says Mary , " completely changes the course of your life . " <p> * * * <p> Arie soon discovers buying a kidney is a pretty easy path to take in Israel . In dialysis units , in doctors ' offices , even in newspaper classified ads , the names of organ brokers - people who arrange kidney trades - are an open secret . For $ 60,000 to $ 150,000 , a new kidney can be purchased . <p> Arie starts surfing the Web , looking at clinics in the United States that do transplant surgery . A friend suggests a medical-advice hotline run by an aide to an influential rabbi . " People call him and say , ' I need an operation ' and ' Who 's good ? ' " says Arie . He tries it and gets the name of a doctor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a broker who tells him a transplant , done in South Africa , will cost $ 100,000 , with 10 percent paid up front . <p> It 's a lot of money , but Arie figures he can at least manage the down payment from his retirement fund . <p> Many Israelis , even those without great wealth or savings , find ways to cover the cost . Israel 's health-insurance funds reimburse patients as much as $ 70,000 for any medical procedure done abroad . Technically they 're not supposed to pay for illegal operations , but if it 's done outside Israel , it 's off their radar screen . Critics say the health-care companies are turning a blind eye to an international racket . Government and health officials say there 's no way to control what a patient does outside Israeli territory . <p> There is an attractive economic component to this setup . Paying $ 70,000 for one kidney transplant is far cheaper than $ 50,000 a year for life in dialysis bills . But it 's more than money . The transplant recipient is healthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialysis patient . <p> Some argue that since the trade is already flourishing , and is difficult to stop , the best way to protect sellers is to decriminalize it and create a regulated market . Michael Friedlaender is one of Arie 's doctors after the operation and heads the kidney-transplant follow-up unit at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem . He once opposed organ sales . Now he advocates a legal market . <p> Under the current system , he says , if something goes wrong during surgery , or if the financial transaction turns out to be a scam , neither the donor nor the recipient has any legal recourse . A regulated system , he says , would change that , and allow for things like malpractice suits , which help safeguard the process . <p> In a free market , Dr. Friedlaender argues , it 's unethical not to pay for an organ . <p> " Someone 's saving your life , " he says , " and you 're not going to reward him ? We pay for every other service in the world . " Donating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because it saves a life . " <p> * * * <p> Only a few weeks after making contact with the broker , Arie gets the call . " We have a donor for you in South Africa , " the broker says . Then things move fast . Plane tickets are delivered . He gives the broker a $ 10,000 downpayment , with the rest payable when he 's admitted to the hospital for surgery . Suddenly he and Mary are on their way to South Africa . <p> On April 8 , 2003 , they arrive at St. Augustine 's . With its warm yellow walls , highly polished floors , and views of the ocean , the transplant ward is one of the most luxurious in the country . They 're struck by the professionalism of the staff . <p> But they hit a snag . <p> It turns out that Arie 's donor has high blood pressure and is rejected by the syndicate . This comforts Arie and Mary , and persuades them that the doctors and brokers are n't just trying to scam them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Brazilian there . Arie and Mary often hear Brazilian music wafting through the hospital hall , and the TVs are tuned to soccer . After several days of more tests , a suitable donor is found . <p> Arie soon meets the young man ( Arie wo n't reveal his name ) who 's going to change his life . He 's tall , thin , and youthful . He grins constantly . Through a translator he says he does n't smoke or drink . He just wants to improve his life by getting married and going to college to become an architect . <p> As they talk , Arie keeps trying to remember how to say " thank you " in Portuguese . <p> " Ob ... , Ob ... , " he stutters . <p> " Obrigado , " Mary chimes in . <p> Through his interpreter , he asks the Brazilianif he really consents wholehearteldy to giving his kidney . The young man smiles , and says , " Yes . " He offers his hand to Arie , and the two men shake as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eve of Passover , the Jewish holiday that celebrates the Children of Israel 's passage from slavery into the freedom of the Promised Land . As he 's lying on the gurney , being wheeled into the operating room , he whispers , " Shma Yisrael , " a Jewish prayer that affirms God 's oneness and the commandment to love God with all one 's heart , soul , and mind . <p> That evening , back at the hotel , Mary feels lonely and apprehensive . Some local Jewish families have invited her to celebrate Passover with them , but she does n't feel like being cheery and social . In her room , she lights some candles and reads the Passover story . Perhaps the surgery will finally let her husband find a new freedom of his own . <p> The next day she sees him , and he does n't look well . He 's pale gray and connected to machines she 's seen all her professional life , but it 's different when it 's her husband . To her relief , the doctors say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , Arie meets his donor again . They pose for photographs . The Brazilian wraps an arm around Arie , flashes a thumbs up sign , and beams . In his bright red shirt , he looks like a fan whose team has just won the championship . <p> The ring is busted <p> Unknown to him , under South Africa 's 1983 Human Tissue Act , Arie and his donor have broken the law . But the organ brokers and doctors are the ones making the biggest profits - and are the real targets of the police . Buying and selling kidneys across three continents is , in some ways , the perfect 21st-century crime . That 's what South African investigator Johan Wessels realizes as he gets further and further into his new case . For one thing , it occurs in several jurisdictions , all of which are thousands of miles apart . And it 's hard to determine where exactly the crime - handing over the money - takes place . And if one country starts cracking down , the syndicate can hop to another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a group from the elite Commercial Branch , South Africa 's equivalent of the FBI 's white-collar-crime unit . The team is headed by Capt . Louis Helberg , a reserved man . <p> By the middle of 2003 , the team has a firm idea of what 's going on . Donors are getting $ 6,000 to $ 18,000 for their kidneys . They 're coming from Israel , Brazil , and maybe Russia and Romania , given the Eastern European-sounding names on the hospital records . Two doctors at St. Augustine 's appear to be heavily involved . It looks as if some of the South Africans have pocketed as much as $ 450,000 doing more than 107 operations . <p> Police say the organizers meet 11 of the 12 criteria for a " syndicate " - a criminal enterprise akin to the mafia . There 's only one criterion the group has n't met : no one has been killed , say the investigators . <p> * * * <p> After one long day working on the investigation , Johan , Captain Helberg , and another detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee and fall into conversation about the case . <p> " How far would you go if one of your kids needed a kidney ? " asks one detective . The question opens a debate on the validity and ethics of the very law they 've sworn to uphold . <p> For most people , the initial response to buying or selling a body part is revulsion . It 's what bioethicists call " the yuck factor . " But the moral underpinning of that feeling - which in turn becomes codified as law - is often hard to articulate , says Walter Robinson , a pediatrician and bioethicist at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge , Mass . " It 's a violation of ' naturalness , ' " he says . " But ' naturalness ' is difficult to describe . " It can emanate from people 's moral or religious values , subtle prejudices , or tradition . <p> Personal or societal definitions of " naturalness " can change , Dr. Robinson observes . They have shifted in the US for instance , regarding interracial marriage and homosexuality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , I 'd do anything , " even though it 's illegal , Johan says , thinking of his two children . " I 'd borrow lots of money . I 'd even sell the farm , " he says , referring to one of his favorite places in the world , a 700-acre spread that 's been in his family for four generations . <p> It 's a typical parental response - doing anything for a child . In fact , growing numbers of doctors and ethicists agree that people like Johan or Arie should be able to buy kidneys , and that people like Hernani should be able to sell them . They argue , for instance , that banning organ sales robs sellers , who are often poor , of a rare option to escape poverty . They also argue that high-minded efforts to shield the poor from themselves can be paternalistic or hypocritical . " If the rich are free to engage in dangerous sports for pleasure ... it is difficult to see why the poor , who take the lesser risk of kidney selling ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , " says Dr. Friedlaender in Israel . <p> But as the detectives ' coffee cools , they weigh the other side , too . They wonder if rumors about " organjacking " - people being killed for their organs - might be true . Critics say the current system has already jump-started a dangerous commodification of the human body , which could turn the world 's slums into reservoirs of body parts for the rich . Today , in Manila 's slums , the selling of kidneys has led to sales of lungs and corneas . <p> As the detectives talk it through , Johan 's views develop . " Life is already really cheap in our society , " he says later . " People will kill each other for a firearm and a little cash . " And if you start giving people money for their kidneys , " you 're going to start finding a lot of dead bodies with no organs . " <p> These kinds of gruesome scenarios are what seal Johan 's opinion . The detectives get up from the table , strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * <p> A few weeks later , Johan adds another plank to his position . As he 's eating breakfast , he tunes into an American TV news show . A reporter is interviewing a mother whose 17-year-old son , as Johan recalls , was killed in a car crash . With the mother 's consent , doctors salvaged 47 organs and tissues from the boy 's body - corneas , kidneys , liver , lungs , heart . " I did n't know they could get that many organs from one body , " Johan thinks to himself . <p> The reporter asks if the mother thinks she should be paid for all the organs her son gave away freely . How could I take money for them ? Johan remembers her saying . God gave each of us the body we use when we 're alive . He gave it to us for free . How could we charge someone else for part of it ? He calls his wife right away . <p> " This makes more sense to me as a Christian than anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * * * <p> The detectives have been toiling for months now , slowly piecing the trafficking puzzle together . But in late November they get a major break . The police team gets a call , out of the blue , from an officer at a nearby police station . The cop has two Israelis with him . One is accusing the other of stealing $ 18,000 , and there 's something about a kidney . When the detectives later question the two men , they ca n't believe their ears . <p> One man , known as S. Zohr , admits he received $ 18,000 for agreeing to sell his kidney . He 'd actually been lying on the operating table at St. Augustine 's , just moments away from surrendering his organ to an ailing Israeli man named Agania Robel , when he got spooked . Zohr jumped off the table , grabbed his clothes , and bee-lined for the airport , trying to take the $ 18,000 with him . <p> But then , a man named Shushan Meir , who later is charged with being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Mr. Zohr was stealing the money . Mr. Meir apparently hoped , strangely enough , that the cops would help prevent this illegal deal from going sour . It was the final confirmation the police needed to bust up the ring . <p> On the morning of Nov. 27 , 2003 - a year and a day after Hernani went under the knife - Johan , Helberg , and a police team that includes a photographer and several plainclothes detectives converge on the back parking lot at St. Augustine 's . They walk quickly up the hill into the facility 's transplant division . <p> Helberg , the team leader , announces that they have a search warrant and will be seizing files . Johan adds that he 's an independent investigator looking into crimes committed under the Human Tissue Act . He does n't need a search warrant and can look at any of the clinic 's files at any time . He steps into a side office where a whiteboard hangs on the wall . Scrawled on it are two names - " A. Robel " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are those ? " he asks Lindy Dickson , a staff member who would later be arrested and charged with complicity in the scheme . She tells him the two men are , at this moment , on operating tables upstairs . <p> Robel . That 's the guy who was left stranded when Zohr jumped off the table last week , Johan realizes . And he 's already been paired up with another donor , a Brazilian named Rogerio Bezzera da Silva . With this , Johan gets a glimpse of the efficiency and sophistication of the syndicate . Only days after one donor gets cold feet , the group has another one on the operating table . This one , he will learn , is getting only $ 6,000 for his kidney . Robel , the recipient , is paying $ 45,000 for a new organ . <p> Police decide against arresting the two men while they 're on operating tables , but several days later , they make three arrests . Robel , the recipient , pleads guilty . He 's fined about $ 770 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Meir , are charged . One makes a plea bargain , while Meir will be tried beginning July 13 . Mr. Bezzera da Silva is n't charged , but he forfeits his $ 6,000 . <p> That same week , Brazilian police also arrest two Israelis and nine Brazilians . <p> The $ 6,000 is gone <p> Nearly a year after his South African trip , every last bit of Hernani 's $ 6,000 is gone . Daisy sells popsicles to pay the bills . Hernani sold his motorbike after sliding off the road one rainy night and running into the back of a truck . He now walks with a limp . <p> Hernani continues to see Antonia . There is no dialogue between Hernani and Daisy , only the occasional monotone orders for her to get the phone , go shopping , mind the children . He will not hold 9-year-old Luiza 's hand when they walk around the neighborhood together , and he can not , or will not , pay for her to play organized soccer , even though she controls the ball better than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hernani 's plight is common among kidney sellers . According to the study in India , organ selling actually increased poverty . Some 54 percent of sellers were extremely poor before losing a kidney . A year later , 74 percent were still in debt , and the average family income had declined by about 30 percent . <p> For Hernani , things could hardly get worse . <p> But they do . <p> On Tuesday , Dec. 2 , 2003 , Hernani , like 40 million other Brazilians , is watching the nightly news on TV Globo . He 's had a tough day . He 's heard that the friend with the white VW , who was instrumental in convincing Hernani to sell his kidney , was arrested in a surprise raid that morning . No one knows why the Brazilian FBI would be after him . <p> Sitting on the couch that night with another friend , Hernani discovers why . Police in South Africa have broken up an international organ-trafficking ring , he hears the announcer say . Authorities have detained 11 people in the last 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " organ trafficking " and " arrests " jump out at him , just like that day when he heard a man behind him say : " We pay people $ 6,000 . " <p> But this time he 's full of dread . <p> " Man , you 've got to get out of here , " his friend warns . <p> One word that keeps coming into his head : " Why ? " I have done nothing wrong , harmed no one . I crossed the world to give life to a dying man . I sold only what was mine . Why are they doing this ? Why me ? I am going to jail , Hernani thinks to himself . Within minutes , he has changed his clothes and slips out into the night . Soon he 's banging on the metal door of a local hot-sheet hotel , where rooms are rented by the hour . The receptionist is surprised to see a single man looking for a room , but he accepts Hernani 's credit card and hands him a key . <p> Afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at himself in the mirror overhead . He 's not reviewing his decision to sell his kidney . He 's not worrying about the police finding him . He 's worrying about whether he has enough money in the bank to pay the hotel bill - about $ 7 per night . <p> * * * <p> As the investigation continues into 2004 , Johan is still unsettled about his religious perspective on organ sales . As he drives home one night , he realizes he 's had a change of heart from his first inclination to " do anything " to save himself or one of his family members , including buying a kidney . Knowing what he knows now , he 'd try to figure out something legal . For instance , he , his brother , and his best friend all have O-negative blood . And they 've got an understanding : If one of them ever needs blood - or maybe an organ - the others would step up . He knows people who have done so . A couple of years ago , a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member . " It was such a huge sacrifice , " he thinks . <p> He realizes he 's become pretty passionate about this stuff . But he still has n't found biblical guidance . <p> That night at home he goes to his bedroom and picks up his Bible . He sits down on the bed and speaks into the silence . " Lord , there has to be something in this book of yours about this , " he says . <p> He opens to a verse he had n't considered before . Romans 12:1 . He reads these words from Paul 's letter : " Give your bodies a living sacrifice . " <p> Paul may have meant something else when he wrote it , but to Johan it now feels important to donate his organs after death . " Jesus sacrificed himself for everyone - gave his whole body for all mankind . " The least we can do , he thinks , is give part of our body to someone else in need . Finally he has what he 's been looking for . <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arie Pach , now 57 years old , is living a new life of freedom - sort of . His youngest son is getting married this summer , and Arie will be there under the wedding canopy . <p> But he 's told he 'll have to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of his life . And he 's photosensitive ; he ca n't go out in the midday sun much and finds himself missing a day at the beach . He used to like to swim , but now , on doctors ' orders , he has to beware of contracting an illness by going to public pools . <p> " I 'm more philosophical and more resigned about my own fate , " he says on a cool afternoon at home , where pastel flowers are in bloom in the tiny backyard garden . " There are so many things in life that could have been worse , but thank God I 'm fine now , " he says . And even though he has a new kidney from across the world , he 's still searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious , " he says , " but I guess you could say I pray more , to ask for a refuah shlema - a full healing . " <p> Epilogue <p> As far as investigators know , the syndicate that orchestrated kidney swaps for at least two yearsin Durban between Brazilians and Israelis is dismantled . But the global trade - and the debate about it - rolls on . <p> In South Africa , four alleged syndicate members have been charged and await trial . Johan Wessels and Captain Helberg and his team have expanded the investigation to hospitals in Johannesburg and Cape Town . <p> In Brazil , Captain Ivan is one of 28 ringleaders who have been indicted . In all , some 50 cases are being investigated by a parliamentary committee , which is expected to submit its findings in September . Hernani has been helping , despite receiving death threats . When he testified before Parliament in January , he wore sunglasses and a shirt up over most of his face to hide his identity . <p> Daisy , meanwhile , has made up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the money to support herself and their children . At one point , she considered selling a cornea . She 's heard the going rate is nearly $ 30,000 . <p> Around the world , meanwhile , organ-sale laws are shifting . In Israel , for instance , one proposed law by the Ministry of Health aims to halt the country 's involvement in the trade by targeting organ brokers - including penalties of up to three years in prison . Another proposal would allow voluntary organ donors to have all of their related healthcare costs picked up , as well as compensation for lost time at work when recuperating from the surgery . Others in Israel , such as Friedlaender , argue that the government should set up a fund to give substantial compensation to those who volunteer to be living donors . <p> In the US , Wisconsin recently became the first state to give living donors a tax deduction of up to $ 10,000 , to write off lost salary , and medical and travel costs . At least 14 other states are considering similar measures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Recovery Improvement Act , which reimburses living donors for expenses incurred during the process and funds research projects aimed at increasing donations . <p> But laws may not keep pace with a global market moving at the speed of commerce . There is , for instance , skyrocketing demand for pieces of livers , which can grow into a fully functioning organ in a recipient . Now a website - liver4you.org - promises " transplant surgery in as short as 10 days " in the Philippines . <p> Sitting in his office in Jerusalem , Friedlaender points to a small trinket hanging from one of his bookshelves . One of his patients brought it to him a couple of months ago after going abroad to get a new kidney . It 's from a country that may already have replaced South Africa as a hot spot for body-part trading . <p> It 's a red paper lantern from China . <p> Editor 's note <p> This report was written as a nonfiction narrative . Specific scenes and dialogue are based largely on recollections of those who participated in the kidney-transplant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Africa . The reporting was done over five months in four countries . <p> Correspondent Andrew Downie flew to Recife , Brazil , and met with Hernani Gomes da Silva and his wife , Daisy , four times over four days , reconstructing what happened . Later , he confirmed more facts and details by phone with the da Silvas , their attorney , and Brazilian police . <p> The Monitor paid Mr. Gomes da Silva its standard photo fee for use of a picture of him with his Israeli kidney recipient in South Africa . Normally , the Monitor does not pay interview subjects for information to avoid conflicts of interest . In this instance , that risk seemed marginal . <p> Staff writer Abraham McLaughlin went twice to Durban , South Africa . He spent four days meeting with police and investigators and visiting St. Augustine 's Hospital . From South African court documents , and a photo provided by Hernani , the Monitor tracked down the Israeli recipient of Hernani 's kidney . But the recipient declined to be interviewed by staff writer Nicole Gaouette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Arie Pach and his wife , Mary , who were willing to relate their experience . They also spoke nearly a dozen times on the phone . <p> David Clark Scott World editor <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
