GEAR TO HELP BLUR YOUR VISION Want to be richer , thinner , sexier and funnier ? We 'd love to help you with that , but , if we did , the editors at Men 's Health would kill us like ants by reflecting the sun off their blindingly white smiles and smooth , shiny bodies . Instead , here 's a handful of items that have helped us go a bit quicker on the bike . 1 . BLACKBURN DELPHI 5.0 The Delphi makes you iaster by being more accurate and more up-to-the-second with information from a training routine . A seven-second dataaveraging interval ( some models pause as long as 30 seconds between calculations ) , a 100-hour chronograph and a lap function unlike that of any other cyclocomputer set it apart . Simply put , it lets you record an interval workout while it collects time , distance , average speed and average heart rate for each leg of the workout . In turn , that lets you know if you 're really reaching your time/heart rate splits for each segment , while still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart rate and heart rate max , as well as total distance , average speed , maximum speed , and so forth .

STAN 'S NOTUBES ZTR OLYMPIC DISC With a sub-350-gram rim , 1.5/1.8 butted spokes and American Classic disc hubs , Stan 's ZTR Olympic Disc wheels are among the lightest we 've ridden . When you combine that with Stan 's tube-type tire conversion ( Stan 's latex sealant allows many non-tubeless tires to work as tubeless ) , you get a freakishly light set of wheels . Acceleration is stunning , and so far our set has survived cross-country abuse well . The only negative is a little bit of lateral flex noticed even by the 150-pound test rider they 're built for , but it 's well worth the light weight and resulting speed . PRICE : $595/pair WEIGHT : 618 grams ( front ) ; 726g ( rear ) CONTACT : notubes.com-Ron Koch 4 . VUELTA CARBON PRO CLINCHER WR Designed lor pure speed in flat time trials or criterium races , these Vuelta wheels look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We used them along the SoCaI coast and were stunned by the increase in overall speed . Even the rolling hills on the South County portion of Coast Highway were quickly gobbled up . For non-mountainous riding we loved the performance but had one quibble : Out-of-the-saddle efforts resulted in a slight creaking sound from both wheels . PRICE : $2,000 ( includes Michelin Krylion Carbon tires , skewers and extra spokes ) WEIGHT : 700g ( front ) , 860g ( rear ) CONTACT : vueltausa.com-Mike Cushionbury 5 . MAXXIS MAXXLITE 310 When it comes to flat-out speed , Maxxis Maxxlite 310 tires are the fastest cross-country mountain bike tires we 've ridden . Maxxis gets away with an incredibly thin tread area by using a durable , hard-rubber compound ( technology borrowed from its car-tire division ) . Ultrashort ramped knobs provide an acceptable amount of bite on hard , dry terrain , but when you venture outside of that realm , they become a handful to control . At only 304 grams , the Maxxlites accelerate and feel more like road tires than off-road meat . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : $60 WEIGHT : 304g CONTACT : maxxis.com-R.K. 6 . FIRST ENDURANCE OPTYGEN One of the most popular endurance supplements , Optygen is loaded with cordyceps and rhodiola , which have been shown in some studies to increase oxygen uptake and VOsub 2 max , helping maximize the body 's adaptation to high levels of physical stress . During tests , many staffers have noticed an increased ability to ride at or near threshold . You ca n't just down a bottle of the red pills and magically go faster , but if you 've been training properly , Optygen may help maximize your performance in a noticeable fashion . PRICE . $50 ( 90-count bottle ) CONTACT : firstendurance.com-M.C. 7 . AMERICAN CLASSIC SPRINT 350 Taking its name from the company 's own 350-gram aluminum rims , these Campy- or Shimano-compatible clinchers are the lightest-per-dollar everyday wheelset we 've ever found . They excel as race wheels , too-not only because they spin up as quickly as you 'd guess a featherweight would , but because the deepish rim wall gives just enough aero advantage for sustaining a long solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radial lacing up front ( 3-cross rear ) , the wheel does n't noodle in corners . There 's one final , much-underestimated way this wheelset truly makes us faster : Unlike almost all chichi wheels , the 350 's traditional construction-from lacing to nipples-means you can easily tune them mid-ride if necessary , and avoid sending them out for the specialty factory repairs that can keep you off some wheelsets for weeks .

HAMMER ENDUROLYTES On hot , aggressive days it can be tough to keep your electrolyte balance at optimum levels for maximum performance . Too much plain water too fast and you run the risk of washing away minerals from your body . Endurolytes are one of those **26;4810;TOOLONG products . Loaded with the most important electrolytic minerals , I 've found they ward off cramps and fatigue without the risk of bloating from an energy drink . Endurolytes do n't upset my stomach , they aid recovery and as an added benefit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded for the next day 's ride . PRICE : $18 ( 120-count bottle ) CONTACT : e-caps.com-M.C. 9 . BONTRAGER XXX LITE VR CARBON Although my hands and wrists fell in love with the hammock-comfortable flats and cutouts of ergonomic bars , especially on rides longer than three hours , I lost my natural sprint position . When I was out of the saddle with my hands deep in the drops , my wrists were pushed into an awkward position by the top of the bars this was a huge deal to me because , as the wimpiest sprinter in my pack , I need to wring every watt I can frnm my engine The traditional-drop , oversize-clamp Bonti bar solved that problem , and brought an added bonus : At just a pip over 170 grams , it is so noticeably light that when I spring out of the saddle on climbs , my bike 's response seems snappier-a benefit I have n't noticed when I 've stripped weight from a seatpost or saddle I do n't know if acceleration actually is improved but it definitely feels that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40. 42 44 , 46cm PRICE $400 WEIGHT 171g ( 42cm ) CONTACT bontragercom-B.S. 10 . EAS NITRON 5 EAS 's Nitron 5 uses nitric oxide with the amino acids ornithine and arginine to support muscle pumps and increase blood flow Io muscles during heavy exercise . The goal , of course , is to increase the delivery of oxygen , nutrients and glucose when muscles are under duress , and to delay lactic buildup When I use Nitron 5 tablets , I don t get sore as quickly , recover faster , and have even had an increased vascular appearance at times Though it 's difficult to put any performance increases into clear percentage numhers . I can say it 's given me favorable results-nothwithstanding the taste of black pepper extract PRICE $60 ( 160-count bottle ) CONTACT : eas.com-M.C. 11 .

Italian Pave doesn t feel especially last If anything , the 300-threads-per-inch tire feels a little too grippy out of the box But while you 're railing you r first turn , you 'll disco ver a totally seamless transition ; nne between the crown of the tire and the shoulders That lets you corner while staying completely balanced through the entire arc .
