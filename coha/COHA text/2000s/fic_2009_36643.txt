The most exalted of habitations is the Ascendancy . But the longest is Rim City . - from The Radiant Way <p> IN THE NEVER-ENDING CITY , Ji Anzi and Titus Quinn finally found a magistrate willing to marry them . In this city of one hundred billion people , they had few friends . One , to be exact : Zhiya . And she was a despised godder , though appearances could be misleading . Anzi knew that Zhiya 's network of contacts sent tendrils throughout Rim City , throughout the Entire . <p> One of Zhiya 's contacts was this resin-addicted magistrate who lay before them . He was barely conscious , an impoverished legate who lived on the never-ending wharf in a hovel almost too small to hold the three-person wedding party . It would n't do to engage a fully conscious magistrate to officiate . The whole city was looking for Titus and Anzi , backed up by legions of Tarig , and perhaps Titus 's enemies in the Rose as well . He was a man well hated , but beloved of Ji Anzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join their lives . It must be done quickly . With so many searching for them , they might be discovered at any moment . Titus said that marriage was a thing that would bind them now and forever , no matter what happened next . He was , Anzi knew from profound experience , a man who wanted a family . He 'd had one . Now he had her , and it seemed he meant to keep her . <p> The legate had agreed to marry them , but Changjun stunk of resin-laden smoke and was so weak he could n't sit up . <p> Titus turned to the godwoman Zhiya . " He 's half dead . " <p> Zhiya shrugged . " The less he remembers , the better . " <p> Anzi looked askance at the magistrate , wondering how she had come to this moment , to marry Titus Quinn in a shack that smelled of drugs and vomit . <p> The legate reached in the direction of the voices , rasping something unintelligible . <p> " Certainly , " Zhiya answered him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought out a small chunk from her pocket , opening her palm to display it . " Yours very soon , honorable Changjun . " Zhiya might serve the God of the Entire , but she was not above drug dealing and treason . Titus trusted the dwarf godwoman with whom he 'd forged a friendship on his way to Ahnenhoon . Anzi took his word for it that Zhiya opposed the lords and supported Titus-a startling betrayal for a high-ranking Venerable . <p> A spike of laughter from outside reminded Anzi that amid Rim crowds were many who would gladly hand them over to the Tarig . After Ahnenhoon , she and Titus were notorious . But what , Anzi wondered , did people think had happened at Ahnenhoon to make both her and the famous outlaw fugitives ? She doubted the realm 's sentients knew the All needed the Rose for burning . She doubted they knew Ahnenhoon was the sight of more than the Long War . Its fortress was the repository for the great engine that was already burning stars , allowing the Tarig to test their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovel , Anzi wondered if the legate could be roused to conduct the civil ceremony . He was saturated with the drug and had pissed himself . This was not the marriage she had dreamed of . Was it a good idea ? They had n't had time to think it through . Titus loved her and was taking her for his second wife . Second , if Joanna was still alive . This was doubtful . But for Titus 's sake , she hoped Johanna lived . The burden of her death was something Anzi hoped he would be spared by the God of Misery . <p> Zhiya checked again at the door-as though she could stop a Tarig from entering . Zhiya was hardly a soldier : barely four feet in height , with a sideways gamboling walk and a persistent disregard for her service to her religious order . <p> Zhiya smiled at the reeking legate . " Hurry , Excellency , " she crooned , " Marry them and celebrate with the heavenly smoke . " <p> The legate roused himself onto one elbow , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and shook him by the shoulders . " By the mucking bright ... " she began . But the man fell back , eyes rolling up . He had passed out . <p> From just beyond the walls came the sound of the sea splatting against the breakwater . Changjun 's room had a glorious location next to the largest sea in either universe . But then everyone in Rim City had more or less the same location , the city being many thousand of miles long and a stone 's throw wide . <p> Titus glanced at Zhiya . " Check the street . We 're leaving . " <p> Zhiya did n't budge . " I could perform the ceremony . " <p> Anzi stifled a gasp of dismay . " No . You 're a godwoman . The Miserable God would curse us . " Anzi cast around for another solution . " Find us a priest of the Red Throne . " <p> Zhiya kicked at the slumbering legate , muttering . " My dear , it 's a charming thought to be helped by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . But if you get another idea , be sure to keep it to yourself . " <p> " But , " Anzi continued , unfazed , " the Society of the Red Throne- " <p> " Believes in the lords , commerce , and the three vows . No , Anzi , I 'm afraid you 're stuck with me . Only three can do the job : a legate , a ship keeper , or a godder . " Motioning toward the comatose legate , Zhiya said , " You 're down to two choices . See any ship keepers ? " <p> Titus looked at Anzi , saying softly , " Let her do it , my love . What more can the Miserable God bring on us ? " <p> Anzi raised an eyebrow . What more could He do ? What , besides threaten the Rose universe with extinction ? What , besides give Titus a weapon to save the Rose , and then , diabolically , make it a weapon he could n't bring himself to use ? The cirque he 'd brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had proven to be a molecular weapon that would erase not just the Tarig threat but the whole of the Entire . At Ahnenhoon , as Titus was at the very moment of depositing the weapon at the base of the engine , Titus 's first wife told him to make peace with his God . In this way she let slip that Titus was about to die . That everyone in the Entire was about to die , since the weapon would destroy the Entire . He 'd asked her what she knew of the cirque and how she could know . He learned that he 'd been tricked by Lord Oventroe to bring a doomsday weapon to Ahnenhoon . Oventroe , who had inspected the cirque and promised it would take down only the engine . <p> They had fled Ahnenhoon , he and Anzi , with the job undone , the engine still churning . But they were forced to leave Johanna behind . She had no doubt been caught at the foot of the engine , the place she was forbidden to be . No doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for . <p> A saving grace was that Johanna would be forced to reveal that Titus had the overwhelming weapon . That he left with it . It could still destroy the Tarig land . Therefore the lords did not dare to simply cross over to the Rose and kill the Earth to forestall future aggression . The lords would most certainly do so if not restrained by this most useful deterrent : the cirque in Titus 's possession . <p> But the problem was he had thrown the cirque away . <p> Titus said again , " Let her do the ceremony , Anzi . " <p> He looked at her with such longing it nearly stopped her breath . Anzi slid a glance at the godwoman , considering whether she could bear to be married by a godder . <p> Zhiya blurted , " You think I want to do it ? If you ask me , Titus should marry me . I 've lusted after him from the first day I saw him . " She shrugged apologetically at Titus 's bride-to-be . <p> Titus was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let the Miserable God do his worst . " <p> At the blasphemy , she raised two fingers to her left eye . " Beloved , never say it . " <p> " Someone has to stand up to him . " <p> Anzi turned to Zhiya . " Yes , then , " she whispered . " You 're not so despised a godder as most . " <p> Zhiya sighed . " By God 's balls , a fine compliment . But shall we get on with this ? " <p> " Yes , Venerable , " Anzi said , almost inaudible . " Bless us . " She closed her eyes , unable to meet Zhiya 's gaze . <p> Without preamble , the godwoman muttered the blessing . Anzi heard it in a blur of resin smoke and adrenaline ... counter of sins , creator of misery ... do not look on this paltry couple , do not bring thine eye to their small , mean , and plodding lives ... <p> " Anzi , " Titus said at last , nudging her from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering , " My great love . My wife . " <p> " Is it over ? " she asked . <p> " Yes , " Zhiya snapped . " Many days of bliss to you both . " She peeked out the door . " We 'll raise a toast at the whorehouse . " She ducked an apology to Anzi . " My side business , but they do know how to have a party . " <p> " Titus , " Anzi said . He paused , waiting for her to go on . " Have you thought what will happen if they catch us ? " <p> He nodded . " Yes . They wo n't catch us . " <p> " But , if they do ? " <p> Zhiya sighed . " The longer we stay here the more chance there is that they will catch you . Go now . Talk later . " <p> Anzi fixed Zhiya with her gaze . " No . There is no later . " <p> Titus grew wary . " What is it ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of the Nigh . " The chain as a deterrent was the only chance left for the Rose , and Titus knew that as well as she did . He just did n't want to admit what it meant . " If we separate , and one of us is caught , we can claim the device is with the other person . " She saw him resisting this idea . " The chain still has power-if they believe we have it . They 'll be afraid to move against the Earth if they think I 'll open the links and let out the plague . Or you will . " <p> " No , Anzi . " <p> " Pardon , but I think yes . " <p> Zhiya rolled her eyes . " What a fine beginning to marital harmony . " <p> Ignoring her , Titus said , " No . If we 're caught we 'll just say we gave it to someone for safekeeping . " <p> " But who would that be ? Among all the sentients of the Entire , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suspect us . " <p> " Anzi , " he pleaded . " No , I do n't like it . " <p> " I might choose to go without your agreement . " <p> They looked at each other for a long moment . Titus was processing this . He had already heard the wisdom of what she said . She thought he 'd already decided , but was postponing saying so . <p> She went to his arms . " My love , " she whispered . They held each other . <p> Anzi pushed away finally . " Wait for me , Titus . " <p> He held her at arms ' length . " I hate this . Go , if you think best . But do n't pretend to have the cirque . I ca n't ask it of you . I wo n't . " <p> " No . Do n't ask . " He was always wanting to do the right thing . He had done so many awful things that he weighed small things too hard because they were easier to grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her resolve , he said , " Come home to me . " <p> " Yes . " <p> Zhiya regarded the leave taking with growing impatience . " Where will you go , girl ? " <p> " To a far primacy . Somewhere you ca n't guess . " <p> Zhiya flicked her gaze at Titus . " I 'll put her on a vessel , then . " <p> He nodded . After a pause he said , " Give us one hour alone . " <p> The godwoman smirked . " What ? Here ? " She noted the unconscious legate sprawled on the only bed . " You do n't have the luxury of an hour . " <p> " Give us some goddamn time , Zhiya . " <p> Anzi put a hand on his arm , getting his attention . " We 'll have our time . " It was something she was not quite ready to believe , but she said it anyway , her heart cooling . She lifted her hood and yanked it forward , moving to the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood back . Cupping her face , he kissed her in a way that instantly heated her . <p> She pressed him away at last . " The Chalin never say farewell . I wo n't say it now . " <p> " No , " he agreed . " Protect yourself first . Promise me . " <p> " First before what ? " <p> " Before me . " <p> " I promise . " <p> Zhiya took Anzi 's arm . " Pull that hood over your head , and let 's get out of here . " She cut a reassuring look at Titus , but Anzi could not look at him again . <p> She and Zhiya slipped through the door . <p> Once out in the street , the godwoman hurried alongside Anzi toward the wharf , where a navitar vessel might be found . " You have no more intention of putting yourself first than I do of going celibate . You are an impressive liar , Ji Anzi . " <p> Anzi nodded under her hood . " Thank you , Venerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
