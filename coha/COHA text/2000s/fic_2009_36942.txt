" Move one inch in any direction and you 'll be sipping your food through a straw . " <p> Caleb Wilson jerked back at the sound of the outraged feminine voice and smacked his head on the frame of the jimmied window . He cut loose a stream of profanity inventive enough to make even his old Air Force buddies proud . <p> He had come to an empty house in the middle of nowhere Kauai , Hawaii , just after midnight , looking for information about a missing friend he now feared dead . Instead of explanations , Cal got a welcoming committee of the angry female variety . His least favorite type of woman . <p> As plans went , so far this one sucked . <p> Since the element of surprise no longer rested on his side , Cal decided to try a new tact . Until he figured out who the unidentified woman with the big mouth was and what she was doing in this small house , he would stay right where he was . <p> He cleared his throat in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ball on a windowsill could sound . " Maybe I could- " <p> " No . " <p> So much for the reasonable route . <p> He twisted his six-foot frame around in the small opening . Finding a tolerable position grew more impossible by the second . His muscles hardened and his patience started a countdown to zero . <p> " Ma'am , I 'm stuck . " He attempted to laugh , but being doubled over the sound came out more like a wheeze . <p> " What you are is trespassing . " <p> Okay , that too . " You have me at a disadvantage here . " <p> " And ? " <p> He moved to his next plan . Charm . <p> " I 'm sitting in a window , " he explained , throwing in an endearing chuckle to see if that could win over the woman with the voice so throaty it should be illegal . <p> " I did n't put you there . " <p> Also immune to charm . Check . <p> But she did have a point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if you could- " <p> " Do n't move . " <p> Then he heard it . An unmistakable metal clicking sound . The noise chased away all thoughts about the long legs that might complete the matching set to that husky voice . <p> The woman held a gun . He survived for thirty-six years on the planet without having a female threaten to shoot him . Looked like he could consider that streak broken . <p> With the door locked , slipping through the window seemed like a good idea a few minutes earlier . Now he was sorry he skipped his initial plan to pick the lock and use the door like a normal person . <p> " I 'm not a thief . " He played many roles in his life . Not that one . <p> " Then why are you breaking in ? " <p> Tough talk , but he heard it . A subtle and unmistakable hitch in her voice . One that meant she was not as in control or calm as her words suggested . One that made that gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abbreviated version of the truth . " This house belongs to an old friend of mine . He invited me . Now I 'm here . " <p> A beat of silence filled the room as his arm fell asleep . The whole idea of Hawaii being the perfect beachside paradise was lost on him at the moment . So far , it had been an obstacle course . No sign of Dan . A round of apologetic glances and mumbled comments about being " sorry " when Cal asked after Dan at the private hangar where Dan kept his helicopter . <p> Top all that with a near-black night and a tire-rutted dirt road leading to a cabin in a wooded area in the middle of Kokee State Park . The same cabin not being anywhere near the beach . <p> Yeah , not exactly what Cal expected to find when he got on the plane that morning . Neither was the non-welcome from a female with questionable emotional stability . <p> Cal toyed with the idea of launching the still-awake parts of his body at his perfumed attacker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by at least fifty pounds . That made the chance of knocking her down pretty damn good . <p> But the gun posed a problem . A big one . If the lady with the deadly weapon and deep voice was a novice , he might leave Kauai in a zipper bag . An amateur would shoot first . Probably fire straight into his forehead . On the other hand , a skilled markswoman definitely would hit him in the forehead . Fifty-fifty and both options ended with his death . Not the best odds . <p> Then there was the problem with the tremor moving through her voice . Now that he was listening for it he did n't hear anything else . She was afraid . Probably smart under the circumstances . Still , there was another emotion mixed in with the fear . He was just clueless enough about the inner workings of the female mind to not be able to define it . <p> He inhaled , drawing in the strong floral scent on the warm Hawaii night air . " I 'm here to see Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumble in her voice was more obvious that time . It gave her away . Stern words wrapped around a mushy inside . <p> Now Cal was getting somewhere in analyzing his opponent . He decided to test her . " What part of the comment did n't you understand ? " <p> " How do you know Dan ? " <p> The woman 's tone softened . Cal guessed she was one in a long line of his friend 's spirited bedroom conquests . Being a commercial pilot in an island paradise apparently had not cut into Dan 's ability to score with the ladies . <p> Cal just hoped this woman did n't fall into the ex-girlfriend-of-Dan category . Calming scorned women was not one of Cal 's skills . Especially another guy 's scorned women . He had enough trouble keeping his own sex life straight without taking on someone else 's . <p> " Look , can I step down or not ? I 'm losing feeling in my legs and my neck is getting stiff . " Not to mention the spasm in his back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She-whoever she was-treated him to a sigh . " Fine . Go ahead and stand up . " <p> " You 're too kind , " Cal said in his most sarcastic tone . <p> " I can still change my mind , you know . " <p> " Well , I do now . " <p> Thanks to years of military training , his body functioned at high level . He could outrun and outshoot men much younger . But the combination of the long plane ride from Florida , the break-in and trying to decipher both Dan 's cryptic message , and the odd reaction to his name by everyone on the island took a toll . Cal feared the worst and so far he had not been wrong in his low expectations . <p> " My initial threat still stands , " she said in what Cal took to be her **27;1193;TOOLONG hint . <p> " Understood . " <p> He unfolded his cramped legs and stretched , working out the kinks in his muscles one at a time . Feet hitting hard floor had never felt so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he glanced over at his gun-toting greeter . Now that she backed up , a halo of yellow from the weak night light in the kitchen cast her in shadows in the dark room . <p> Cal blinked , straining to see the owner of that raspy voice but could not make out her face . Did see the glint from the barrel of the gun , however . That was enough to keep him from moving closer . <p> " Put your hands on your head . " She did not so much ask as she ordered . <p> " You ca n't be serious . " <p> " Just do it . " <p> Seemed she was serious . " What if I like my hands right where they are ? " <p> " I have the gun , so I decide . " <p> He wondered what she 'd say when she realized he possessed a weapon or two . Hell , she was n't the only one in the room who knew how to wave a gun around and make threats . <p> " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other ? " He shifted until he felt the secure press of his gun against his lower back . <p> The silhouetted woman reached to her left . Cal heard a scratch as she grazed the wall for the switch . After a click , a soft white glow poured through the small room and over the furniture . <p> Not just any furniture . Broken furniture . Torn overstuffed chairs with ripped fabric . Crushed glass and documents littered the floor . Someone had tossed the place . <p> He mentally inventoried the damage before settling his gaze on her . When he did , his blood froze . Hiding a face like hers in shadows should be a sin . Long blondish-brown hair and amber eyes . <p> And the way her snug white T-shirt pulled across her chest highlighted her high , round breasts . Hell , if she were more blond she 'd be a living , breathing Barbie doll . Also made him think the doll 's measurements were not quite as unrealistic as his sister insisted . <p> He tried not to gawk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cut-off blue jeans shorts down to her painted pink toenails . <p> Tried and failed . <p> " Is there a problem ? " she asked as she buried the shaky voice under the growl of a drunken sailor . <p> " About a dozen of them , " he mumbled . <p> Her eyes narrowed until only slits of gold were visible . " Who are you ? " <p> Under those impressive looks she carried a gun . Since he did not know if she intended to use it , he fell back on his plan of appeasement . " Tell me what happened in here . " <p> " I guess you were n't the only person who tried to break in here tonight . " Her gaze moved from his chest to his shoulders . " Wearing black from head to toe . Subtle , by the way . " <p> He glanced down to his dark sneakers . Maybe the monotone outfit amounted to overkill . He chalked it up to another choice that made sense at one point but now seemed a bit over-the-top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not here to burglarize the house , " he said even though he knew it sounded lame . <p> " You just really like black ? " <p> The time had come to shift attention away from his wardrobe choices . He moved around discarded pens and miscellaneous papers with the tip of his shoe . <p> Her frown slipped , showing the much more vulnerable face of the woman behind that , at times , unsure voice . " Tell me who you are . " <p> " We 're not going to play the game this way . " <p> " Oh ? " She waved her weapon from side to side as if to emphasize her point . All that did was convince him of her novice status . <p> That shot to the forehead looked more and more inevitable . <p> " We 're going to share information . Give and take . " He rested his hands on his hips , close to his weapon . <p> " You 've got the gun . I got time . We can stand here all night for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right about now , so he shot her one . " But you might want to remember something else . " <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " You think I 'm a criminal . " <p> " That 's where the evidence points , yeah . " <p> " If I 'm such a bad guy , chances are you 'll blink long before I do , sweetheart . " <p> Chapter Two Forget about later . Cassie Montgomery fought off the urge to blink right then . If she swallowed any harder her tongue would end up in her stomach . <p> She had yelled and ordered this guy around while panic flooded her insides . She was not the type to take on complete strangers with little more than a bad attitude . Unlike her mysterious guest , she did have something to lose-like what was left of her life . <p> The wide-shouldered stranger with the dark brown hair and piercing hazel eyes kept breaking her concentration . In the safety of the darkness she had not been able to see Mr. Tall , Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him now . Criminals were not supposed to look like him . Hell , no one should look like him . Slim black jeans and a sleek black shirt that hugged his body , molding to his muscles like a second skin . Not exactly an outfit meant for late-night hiking . <p> Sun-kissed hands peeked out from underneath the covert clothing , suggesting that whoever he was , he liked to be outside . With her luck , he was probably an escaped convict who worked on the road crew during the day . The fact the man knew her brother 's name kept her from engaging in a bit of uncontrolled screaming and gunplay . <p> That and the fact the guy looked vaguely familiar . Cassie could not place him , which was odd since this guy was n't exactly the forgettable type . Still , something about that face tickled at her memory . <p> She 'd spent weeks trying not to remember anything . Now that she needed to call something up , her mind stuttered to a halt . <p> Grief sucked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm waiting for a formal introduction . And if I have to ask again , I might just go ahead and try talking with the gun . " <p> A sly smile crossed full lips as Cal nodded toward the overturned chair . " May I ? " <p> Muscles strained against the fabric of his pants as he hitched one of his thighs on the arm of the chair . He picked the only piece of furniture not smashed to pieces . That left her to stand , but hovering above this guy felt better than the reverse . <p> " You can actually sit down , " she said so she would have the advantage if he decided to strike . Despite his athletic look , she 'd bet he could not outrun a bullet . <p> His smile only grew . " I 'm good here on the edge . " <p> That made one of them . " Are you ready to talk ? " <p> " Did n't exactly come here to chat . " <p> A good reminder . She knew staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected a flood of tears and regret . She had not counted on a six-foot-something walking risk with broad shoulders and an intelligent flash behind his eyes . <p> Time to act like a woman being hunted . " Talk or I 'll call the police . " <p> He shot her one of those all-too-knowing smiles that all men seemed to have mastered . " I 'm not going anywhere . " <p> " Option B it is . " She flipped open her cell phone and pretended to dial . <p> " You wo n't . " <p> True . She did n't really have anyone to call , but how could he know ? " That 's wishful thinking on your part . " <p> " More like a calculated guess . One I 'm willing to play out . " <p> " This is n't a game . " <p> " Sure feels like it . " <p> Before she could maneuver him to the door , he sprang from the chair and knocked the gun and phone from her hands , sending them skittering across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground on her stomach and smacked her forehead against the chair leg . <p> In a panic , her heart raced and her head spun . She had been numb for weeks , like the walking dead , but nerve endings snapped to life at the unexpected assault . <p> She kicked out aiming for any weakness she could find on her visitor 's trim , lean body . He blocked her attack and launched one of his own . The breath whooshed out of her lungs as he squeezed her upper body in a fierce bear hug against the floor . <p> Being surrounded and crushed by about a hundred and ninety pounds of furious male made her adrenaline pump . Finding strength she did n't know she had , she flailed and tried to punch . Nothing worked . When he flipped her onto her back and pinned her hands above her head , a squeal escaped her tight throat . <p> Heavy breaths beat against her chest as he straddled her . Long-distance running and hours at the gym had not prepared her for this fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , with the weight of everything crushing in on her she lost ground almost from the start . <p> " Now you do n't have the weapon , " he said , more as a fact than a threat . <p> She calculated the distance from her knee to his groin and waited for the right time to attack . " Get off of me . " <p> " Tell me who you are first . " <p> His face did not look quite so handsome now that it loomed over her . And that bored look he wore before , yeah , that disappeared as fast as her balance . <p> " Go to hell . " She wiggled her shoulders , trying to break his stranglehold , but his weight held her down . <p> The vulnerability of her position set her heart pounding until it formed a steady drumbeat in her ears . She bucked her hips and went rock still when her midsection met with his lower body . <p> Big mistake . No reason to encourage anything down there . <p> " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " I 'm not going to hurt you . " <p> Easy for him to say since he was on top and in control . " Like I trust you after that tackle and roll move . " <p> " You 're fine . " <p> The pounding in her head suggested otherwise . For the first time in weeks Cassie felt something other than frustration and sadness . But she was n't sure terror-filled minutes were any better than those that came before . <p> " Let me up , " she said in the strongest voice she could muster . <p> He loosened the grip on her wrists but kept her pinned . " Stop moving around and tell me who you are and how you know Dan . " <p> She glared but stayed quiet . <p> " Okay then . We 'll skip the introductions and get to the point . Where is Dan ? " <p> The question showed this guy lived somewhere else . Either that or the story about being Dan 's friend was just that , a story . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
