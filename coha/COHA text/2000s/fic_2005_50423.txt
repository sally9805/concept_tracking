With only a handful of published stories to his credit . Laird Barron is building a reputation for creepy and unsettling tales such as " Old Virginia " ( Feb. 2003 ) and " Bulldozer " ( published online in SciFiction ) . Hollywood scouts on the lookout for new Stephen Kings and Koji Suzukis have begun buzzing his name , and will likely continue to do so after they recover from this new tale . <p> 1 . AFTER THE DEBACLE IN British Columbia , we decided to crash the Bluegrass festival . Not we-Cruz . Everybody else just shrugged and said yeah , whatever you say , dude . Like always . Cruz was the alpha-alpha of our motley pack . We followed the handmade signs onto a dirt road and ended up in a muddy pasture with maybe a thousand other cars and beat-to-hell tourist buses . It was a regular extravaganza - pavilions , a massive stage , floodlights . A bit farther out , they 'd built a bonfire , and Dead-Heads were writhing among the cinder-streaked shadows with pagan exuberance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electricity and sex . The amplified ukulele music was giving me a migraine . Too many people smashed together , limbs flailing in paroxysms . Too much white light followed by too much darkness . I 'd gone a couple beers over my limit because my face was Novocain-numb and I found myself dancing with some sloe-eyed coed who 'd fixed her hair in corn rows . Her shirt said MILK . She was perhaps a bit prettier than the starlet I 'd ruined my marriage with way back in the days of yore , but resembled her in a few details . What were the odds ? I did n't even attempt to calculate . A drunken man cheek to cheek with a strange woman under the harvest moon was a tricky proposition . " Lookin " for somebody , or just rubberneckin ' ? " The girl had to shout over the hi-fi jug band . Her breath was peppermint and whiskey . " I lost my friends , " I shouted back . A sea of bobbing heads beneath a gulf of night sky and none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had piled out of two cars and now I was alone . Last of the Mohicans . The girl grinned and patted my cheek . " You ai n't got no friends , Raybo . " I tried to ask how she came up with that , but she was squirming and pointing over my shoulder . " My gawd , look at all those stars , will ya ? " Sure enough the stars were on parade ; cold , cruel radiation bleeding across improbable distances . I was more interested in the bikers lurking near the stage and the beer garden . Creepy and mean , spoiling for trouble . I guessed Cruz and Hart would be nearby , copping the vibe , as it were . The girl asked me what I did and I said I was an actor between jobs . Anything she 'd seen ? No , probably not . Then I asked her and she said something I did n't quite catch . It was either etymologist or entomologist . There was another thing , impossible to hear . She looked so serious I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meninges . Sorta like a siphon . " " What ? " I said . " I guess it 's a delicacy . They say it do n't hurt much , but I say nuts to that . " " A delicacy ? " She made a face . " I 'm goin " to the garden . Want a beer ? " " No , thanks . " As it was , my legs were threatening to fold . The girl smiled , a wistful imp , and kissed me briefly , chastely . She was swallowed into the masses and I did n't see her again . After a while I staggered to the car and collapsed . Tried to call Sylvia , wanted to reassure her and Carly that I was okay , but my cell would n't cooperate . Could n't raise my watchdog friend , Rob in L.A. He 'd be going bonkers too . I might as well have been marooned on a desert island . Modern technology , my ass . I watched the windows shift through a foggy spectrum of pink and yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreamt of wasp nests and wasps . And rare orchids , coronas tilted toward the awesome bulk of clouds . The flowers were a battery of organic radio telescopes receiving a sibilant communiqu just below my threshold of comprehension . A mosquito pricked me and when I crushed it , blood ran down my finger , hung from my nail . 2 . CRUZ DROVE . He said , " I wan na see the Mima Mounds . " Hart said , " Who 's Mima ? " He rubbed the keloid on his beefy neck . Bulletproof glass let in light from a blob of moon . I slumped in the tricked-out back seat , where our prisoner would 've been if we 'd managed to bring him home . I stared at the grille partition , the leg irons , and the doors with no handles . A crusty vein traced black tributaries on the floorboard . Someone had scratched R+G and a fanciful depiction of Ronald Reagan 's penis . This was an old car . It reeked of cigarette smoke , of stale beer , of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melted into the background smear . The brutes were smacked out of their gourds on junk they 'd picked up on the Canadian side at the festival . Hart had tossed the bag of syringes and miscellaneous garbage off a bridge before we crossed the border . That was where we 'd parted ways with the other guys - Leon , Rufus , and Donnie . Donnie was the one who had gotten nicked by a stray bullet in Donkey Creek , earned himself bragging rights if nothing else . Jersey boys , the lot ; they were going to take the high road home , maybe catch the rodeo in Montana . Sunrise forged a pale seam above the distant mountains . We were rolling through certified boondocks , thumping across rickety wooden bridges that could 've been thrown down around the Civil War . On either side of busted up two-lane blacktop were overgrown fields and hills dense with maples and poplar . Scotch broom reared on lean stalks , fire-yellow heads lolling hungrily . Scotch broom was Washington 's rebuttal to kudzu . It was quietly everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated nearly extinct ; letters faded , or bullet-raddled , dimmed by pollen and sap . Occasionally , dirt tracks cut through high grass to farmhouses . Cars passed us head-on , but not often , and usually local rigs - camouflage-green flatbeds with winches and trailers , twotone pickups , decrepit jeeps . Nothing with out-of-state plates . I started thinking we 'd missed a turn somewhere along the line . Not that I would 've broached the subject . By then I 'd learned to keep my mouth shut and let nature take its course . " Do you even know where the hell they are ? " Hart said . Hart was sour about the battle royale at the wharf . He figured it would give the bean counters an excuse to waffle about the payout for Piers 's capture . I suspected he was correct . " The Mima Mounds ? " " Yeah . " " Nope . " Cruz rolled down the window , squirted beechnut over his shoulder , contributing another racing streak to the paint job . He twisted the radio dial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in Reno just to watch him die . " " Real man 'd swallow , " Hart said . " Like Josey Wales . " My cell beeped and I did n't catch Cruz 's rejoinder . It was Carly . She 'd seen the bust on the news and was worried , had been trying to reach me . The report mentioned shots fired and a wounded person , and I said yeah , one of our guys got clipped in the ankle , but he was okay , I was okay and the whole thing was over . We 'd bagged the bad guy and all was right with the world . I promised to be home in a couple of days and told her to say hi to her mom . A wave of static drowned the connection . I had n't mentioned that the Canadians contemplated jailing us for various legal infractions and for inciting mayhem . Her mother 's blood pressure was already sky-high over what Sylvia called my " midlife adventure . " Hard to blame her - it was my youthful " adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Sylvia did n't know , could n't know , because I lacked the grit to bare my soul at this late stage of our separation , was during the fifteen-martini lunch meeting with Hart , he 'd showed me a few pictures to seal the deal . A roster of smiling teenage girls that could 've been Carly 's schoolmates . Hart explained in graphic detail what the bad man liked to do to these kids . Right there it became less of an adventure and more of a mini-crusade . I 'd been an absentee father for fifteen years . Here was my chance to play Lancelot . Cruz said he was hungry enough to eat the ass-end of a rhino and Hart said stop and buy breakfast at the greasy spoon coining up on the left , materializing as if by sorcery , so they pulled in and parked alongside a rusted-out Pontiac on blocks . Hart remembered to open the door for me that time . One glimpse of the diner 's filthy windows and the coils of dogshit sprinkled across the unpaved lot convinced me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I did . The place was stamped 1950s from the long counter with a row of shiny black swivel stools and the too-small window booths , dingy Formica peeling at the edges of the tables , to the bubble-screen TV wedged high up in a corner alcove . The TV was flickering with grainy black-and-white images of a talk show I did n't recognize and could n't hear because the volume was turned way down . Mercifully I did n't see myself during the commercials . I slouched at the counter and waited for the waitress to notice me . Took a while - she was busy flirting with Hart and Cruz , who 'd squeezed themselves into a booth , and of course they wasted no time in regaling her with their latest exploits as hardcase bounty hunters . By now it was purely mechanical ; rote bravado . They were pale as sheets and running on fumes of adrenaline and junk . Oh , how I dreaded the next twenty-four to thirty-six hours . Their story was edited for heroic effect . My private version played a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best girl in the Maple Leaf Country . After a bit of " slap and tickle , " as Hart put it , we handed the miscreants over to the Canadians , more or less intact . Well , the Canadians more or less took possession of the pair . The bad man was named Russell Piers , a convicted rapist and kidnapper who 'd cut a nasty swath across the great Pacific Northwest and British Columbia . The girl was Penny Aldon , a runaway , an orphan , the details varied , but she was n't important , did n't even drive ; was along for the thrill , according to the reports . They fled to a river town , were loitering wharf-side , munching on a fish basket from one of six jillion Vietnamese vendors when the team descended . Piers proved something of a Boy Scout - always prepared . He yanked a pistol from his waistband and started blazing , but one of him versus six of us only works in the movies and he went down under a swarm of blackjacks , tasers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole jittering mess on film . The film . That was on my mind , sneaking around my subconscious like a night prowler . There was a moment during the scrum when a shiver of light distorted the scene , or I had a near-fainting spell , or who knows . The men on the sidewalk snapped and snarled , hyenas bringing down a wounded lion . Foam spattered the lens . I swayed , almost tumbled amid the violence . And Piers looked directly at me . Grinned at me . A big dude , even bigger than the troglodytes clinging to him , he had Cruz in a headlock , was ready to crush bones , to ravage flesh , to feast . A beast all right , with long , greasy hair , powerful hands scarred by prison tattoos , gold in his teeth . Inhuman , definitely . He was n't a lion , though . I did n't know what kingdom he belonged to . Somebody cold-cocked Piers behind the ear and he switched off , slumped like a mannequin that 'd been bowled over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right with the world , relatively speaking . Except my bones ached and I was experiencing a not-so-mild wave of paranoia that hung on for hours . Never completely dissipated , even here in the sticks at a godforsaken hole-in-the-wall while my associates preened for an audience of one . Cruz and Hart had starred on Cops and America 's Most Wanted-they were celebrity experts . Too loud , the three of them honking and squawking , especially my ex-brother-in-law . Hart resembled a hog that decided to put on a dirty shirt and steel toe boots and go on its hind legs . Him being high as a kite was n't helping . Sylvia tried to warn me ; she 'd known what her brother was about since they were kids knocking around on the wrong side of Des Moines . I did n't listen . " C'm on , Sylvie , there 's a book in this . Hell , a Movie of the Week ! " Hart was on the inside of a rather seamy yet wholly marketable industry . He had a friend who had a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running . Money in the bank . see you in a few weeks , hold my calls . " Watcha want , hon ? " The waitress , a strapping lady with a tag spelling Victoria , poured translucent coffee into a cup that suggested the dishwasher was n't quite up to snuff . Like all pro waitresses she pulled off this trick without looking away from my face . " I know you ? " And when I politely smiled and reached for the sugar , she kept coming , frowning now as her brain began to labor . " You somebody ? An actor or somethin ' ? " I shrugged in defeat . " Uh , yeah . I was in a couple TV movies . Small roles . Long time ago . " Her face animated , a craggy talking tree . " Hey ! You were on that comedy , one with the blind guy and his seein " eye dog . Only the guy was a con man or somethin ' , was n't really blind and his dog was an alien or somethin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember you . What happened to that show ? " " Canceled . " I glanced longingly through the screen door at our ugly Chevy . " Ray does shampoo ads , " Hart said . He said something to Cruz and they cracked up . " Milk of magnesia ! " Cruz said . " And " If you suffer from erectile dysfunction , now there 's an answer ! ' " He delivered the last in a passable radio announcer 's voice , although I 'd heard him do better . He was hoarse . The sun went behind a cloud , but Victoria still wanted my autograph , just in case I made a comeback , or got killed in a sensational fashion and then my signature would be worth something . She even dragged Sven the cook out to shake my hand and he did it with the dedication of a zombie following its mistress 's instructions before shambling back to whip up eggs and hash for my comrades . The coffee tasted like bleach . The talk show ended and the next program opened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blackberry thickets . The black-and-white imagery threw me . For a moment I did n't recognize the car parked between mounds . Our boxy Chevy with the driver-side door hanging ajar , mud-encrusted plates , taillights blinking SOS . A gray hand reached from inside , slammed the door . A hand ? Or something like a hand ? A B-movie prosthesis ? Too blurry , too fast to be certain . Victoria changed the channel to All My Children , 3 . HART DROVE . Cruz navigated . He tilted a road map , trying to follow the dots and dashes . Victoria had drawled a convoluted set of directions to the Mima Mounds , a one-star tourist attraction about thirty miles over . Cruise on through Poger Rock and head west . Real easy drive if you took the local shortcuts and suchlike . Not an unreasonable detour ; 1-5 was n't far from the site - we could do the tourist bit and still make the Portland night scene . That was Cruz 's sales pitch . Kind of funny , really . I wondered at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a NASCAR and Soldier of Fortune magazine type personality . Hart fit the profile too , for that matter . Damned world was turning upside down . It was getting hot . Cracks in the windshield dazzled and danced . The boys debated cattle mutilations and the inarguable complicity of the Federal government regarding the Grey Question and how the moon landing was fake and remember that flick from the 1970s , Capricorn One , goddamned if OJ. was n't one of the astronauts . Freakin " hilarious . I unpacked the camera , thumbed the playback button , and relived the Donkey Creek fracas . Penny said to me , " Reduviidea - any of a species of large insects that feed on the blood of prey insects and some mammals . They are considered extremely beneficial by agricultural professionals . " Her voice was made of tin and lagged behind her lip movements , like a badly dubbed foreign film . She stood on the periphery of the action , scrawny fingers pleating the wispy fabric of a blue sundress . She was smiling . " The indices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , point oh-two percent vertebrae harvest corresponds to non-click-click purposes . As an X haplotype you are a primary source of click-click . Lucky you ! " " Jesus ! " I muttered and dropped the camera on the seat . Are you talkin " to me ? I stared at too many trees while Robert De Niro did his Taxi Driver shtick as a low frequency monologue in the corner of my mind . Unlike De Niro , I 'd never carried a gun . The guys would n't even loan me a taser . " What ? " Cruz said in a tone that suggested he 'd almost jumped out of his skin . He glared through the partition , olive features drained to ash . Giant drops of sweat sparkled and dripped from his broad cheeks . The light wrapped his skull , halo of an angry saint . Withdrawal 's something fierce , I decided . I shook my head , waited for the magnifying glass of his displeasure to swing back to the road map . When it was safe I hit the playback button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Penny entered the frame she pointed at me and intoned in a robust , Slavic accent , " **34;2650;TOOLONG is Latin for a death god of a primitive Mediterranean culture . Their civilization was buried in mudslides caused by unusual seismic activity . If you say it loud enough - " I hit the kill button . My stomach roiled with rancid coffee and incipient motion-sickness . Third time 's a charm , right ? I played it back again . The entire sequence was erased . Nothing but deep-space black with jags of silvery light at the edges . In the middle , skimming by so swiftly I had to freeze things to get a clear image , was Piers with his lips nuzzling Cruz 's ear , and Cruz 's face was corpse-slack . And for an instant , a microsecond , the face was Hart 's too ; one of those three-dee poster illusions where the object changes depending on the angle . Then , more nothingness , and an odd feedback noise that faded in and out , like Gregorian monks chanting a litany in reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footage shortly after the initial capture in Canada . There was nothing unusual about it . We spent a few hours at the police station answering a series of polite yet penetrating questions . I assumed our cameras would be confiscated , but the inspector simply examined our equipment in the presence of a couple suits from a legal office . Eventually the inspector handed everything back with a stern admonishment to leave dangerous criminals to the authorities . Amen to that . Had a cop tampered with the camera , doctored it in some way ? I was n't a filmmaker , did n't know much more than point and shoot and change the batteries when the little red light started blinking . So , yeah , Horatio , it was possible someone had screwed with the recording . Was that likely ? The answer was no - not unless they 'd also managed to monkey with the television at the diner . More likely one of my associates had spiked the coffee with a miracle agent and I was hallucinating. seemed out of character for those greedy bastards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third wheel - dope was expensive and it was n't like we were expecting a big payday . The remaining options were n't very appealing . My cell whined , a dentist 's drill in my shirt pocket . It was Rob Fries from his patio office in Gardena . Rob was tall , bulky , pink on top and garbed according to his impression of what Miami vice cops might 've worn in a bygone era , such as the " 80s . Rob also had the notion he was my agent despite the fact I 'd fired him ten years ago after he handed me one too many scripts for laxative testimonials . I almost broke into tears when I heard his voice on the buzzing line . " Man , am I glad you called ! " I said loudly enough to elicit another scowl from Cruz . " HoIa , compadre . What a splash y'all made on page sixteen . " American Yahoos Run Amok ! " goes the headline , which is a quote of the Calgary rag . Too bad the stupid bastards let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they fried " em . Well , they do n't have the death penalty , but you get the point . Even so , I see a major motion picture deal in the works . Mucho dinem , Ray , buddy ! " " Fly the coop ? What are you talking about ? " " Uh , you have n't heard ? Piers and the broad walked . Hell , they probably beat you outta town . " " You better fill me in . " Indigestion was eating the lining of my esophagus . " Real weird story . Some schmuck from Central Casting accidentally turned " em loose . The paperwork got misfiled or somesuch bullshit . The muckety-mucks are p.o. ' d . Blows your mind , do n't it ? " " Right , " I said in my actor 's tone . I fell back on this when my mind was in neutral but etiquette dictated a polite response . Up front , Cruz and Hart were bickering , had n't caught my exclamation . No way was I going to illuminate them regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling a u-turn and speeding back to Canada . The home office would be calling any second now to relay the news ; probably had been trying to get through for hours-Hart hated phones , usually kept his stashed in the glovebox . There was a burst of chittery static . " - returning your call . Keep getting the answering service . You wo n't believe it - I was having lunch with this chick used to be one of Johnny Carson 's secretaries , yeah ? And she said her best friend is shacking with an exec who just frickin " adored you in Clancy et ) Spot . Frickin " adored you ! I told my gal pal to pass the word you were riding along on this bounty hunter gig , see what shakes loose . " " Oh , thanks , Rob . Which exec ? " " Lemmesee - uh , Harry Buford . Remember him ? He floated deals for the Alpha Team , some other stuff . Nice as hell . Frickin " adores you , buddy . " " Harry Buford ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loves pastels and lives in Mexico half the year because he 's fond of underage Chicano girls ? Did an expos piece on the evils of Hollywood , got himself blackballed ? That the guy ? " " Well , yeah . But he 's still got an ear to the ground . And he frickin " " Adores me . Got it . Tell your girlfriend we 'll all do lunch , or whatever . " " Anywhoo , how you faring with the gorillas ? " " Um , great . We 're on our way to see the Mima Mounds . " " What ? You on a nature study ? " " Cruz 's idea . " " The Mima Mounds . Wow . Never heard of them . Burial grounds , huh ? " " Earth heaves , I guess . They 've got them all over the world - Norway , South America , Eastern Washington - I do n't know where all . I lost the brochure . " " Cool . " The silence hung for a long moment . " Your buddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glacial deposits . " " They wan na look at some rocks instead of hitting a strip club ? No bullshit ? " " Um , yeah . " It was easy to imagine Rob frowning at his flip-flops propped on the patio table while he stirred the ice in his rum and Coke and tried to do the math . " Have a swell time , then . " " You do me a favor ? " : " Yo , bro ' . Hit me . " " Go on the Net and look up'X haplotype . " Do it right now , if you 've got a minute . " . " X-whatsis ? " I spelled it and said , " Call me back , okay ? If I 'm out of area , leave a message with the details . " " Be happy to . " There was a pause as he scratched pen to pad . " Some kinda new meds , or what ? " " Or what , I think . " " Uh-huh . Well , I 'm just happy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm dying to hear the scoop . " " I 'm dying to dish it . I 'm losing my signal , got ta sign off . " He said not to worry , bro ' , and we disconnected . I worried anyway . 4 . SURE ENOUGH , Hart 's phone rang a bit later and he exploded in a stream of repetitious profanity and dented the dash with his ham hock of a fist . He was still bubbling when we pulled into Poger Rock for gas and fresh directions . Cruz , on the other hand , accepted the news of Russell Piers 's " early parole " with a Zen detachment demonstrably contrary to his nature . " Screw it . Let 's drink , " was his official comment . Poger Rock was sunk in a hollow about fifteen miles south of the state capitol in Olympia . It was n't impressive - a dozen or so antiquated buildings moldering along the banks of a shallow creek posted with No SHOOTING signs . Everything was peeling , rusting , or collapsing toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incongruously -a Utopian brick and tile structure set back and slightly elevated , fresh paint glowing through the alders and dogwoods . Aliens might have landed and dedicated a monument . Cruz filled up at a mom-and-pop gas station with the prehistoric pumps that took an eon to dribble forth their fuel . I bought some jerky and a carton of milk with a past-due expiration date to soothe my churning guts . The lady behind the counter had yellowish hair and wore a button with a fuzzy picture of a toddler in a bib . She smiled nervously as she punched keys and furiously smoked a Pall Mall . Did n't recognize me , thank God . Cruz pushed through the door , setting off the ding-dong alarm . His gaze jumped all over the place and his chambray shirt was molded to his chest as if he 'd been doused with a water hose . He crowded past me , trailing the odor of armpit funk and cheap cologne , grunted at the cashier , and shoved his credit card across the counter . I raised my hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning on the hood . " We 're gon na mosey over to the bar for a couple brewskis . " He coughed his smoker 's cough , spat in the gravel near a broken jar of marmalade . Bees darted among the wreckage . " What about the Mima Mounds ? " " They ai n't goin'anywhere . ' Sides , it ai n't time , yet . " " Time ? " Hart 's narrowed eyes had gone ferret-pink and he smiled slightly . He finished his cigarette and lighted another from the smoldering butt . " Cruz says it ai n't . " " Well , what does that mean ? It " ai n't time ' ? " " I du n no , Ray-bo . I du n no fuckall . Why'nchya ask Cruz ? " " Okay . " I took a long pull of tepid milk while I considered the latest developments in what was becoming the most bizarre road trip of my life . " How are you feeling ? " " Groovy . " " You look like hell . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was separated from Cruz . And I lied , " Sylvia 's worried . " " What 's she worried about ? " I shrugged , let it hang . Impossible to read his face , his swollen eyes . In truth , I was n't sure I completely recognized him , this wasted hulk swaying against the car , features glazed into gargoyle contortions . Hart nodded wisely , suddenly illuminated regarding a great and abiding mystery of the universe . His smile returned . I glanced back , saw Cruz 's murky shadow drifting in the station window . " Man , what are we doing out here ? We could be in Portland by three . " What I wanted to say was , let 's jump in the car and shag ass for California . Leave Cruz in the middle of the parking lot holding his pecker and swearing eternal vengeance for all I cared . " Anxious to get going on your book , huh ? " " If there 's a book . I 'm not much of a writer . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this mess . " " Ai n't much of an actor , either . " He laughed and slapped my shoulder with an iron paw to show he was just kidding . " Hey , lemme tell ya . Did ya know Cruz studied geology at UCLA ? He did . Real knowledgeable about glaciers an " rocks . All that good shit . Thought he was gon na work for the oil companies up in Alaska . Make some fat stacks . Ah , but you know how it goes , doncha , Ray-bo ? " " He graduated UCLA ? " I tried not to sound astonished . It had been the University of Washington for me . The home of medicine , which was n't my specialty , according to the proctors . Political science and drama were the last exits . " Football scholarship . Hard hittin " safety with a nasty attitude . They fuckin'grow on trees in the ghetto . " That explained some things . I was inexplicably relieved . Cruz emerged , cutting a plug of tobacco with his pocket knife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And precisely as a cowboy would unhitch his horse to ride across the street , he fired the engine and rumbled the one quarter block to Moony 's Tavern and parked in a diagonal slot between a hay truck and a station wagon plastered with anti-Democrat , pro-gun bumper stickers . Hart asked if I planned on joining them and I replied maybe in a while , I wanted to stretch my legs . The idea of entering that sweltering cavern and bellying up to the bar with the lowlife regulars and mine own dear chums made my stomach even more unhappy . I grabbed my valise from the car and started walking . I walked along the street , past a row of dented mailboxes , rust-red flags erect ; an outboard motor repair shop with a dusty police cruiser in front ; the Poger Rock Grange , which appeared abandoned because its windows were mostly boarded and where they were n't , kids had broken them with rocks and bottles , and maybe the same kids had drawn 666 and other satanic symbols on the whitewashed planks , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liquor Mart , which was a corrugated shed with bars on the tiny windows , the Laundromat , full of tired women in oversized T-shirts , and screeching , dirty-faced kids racing among the machinery while an A.M. radio broadcast a Rush Limbaugh rerun ; and a trailer loaded with half-rotted firewood for 75 BUCKS ! I finally sat on a rickety bench under some trees near the lone stoplight , close enough to hear it clunk through its cycle . I drew a manila envelope from the valise , spread sloppy typed police reports and disjointed photographs beside me . The breeze stirred and I used a rock for a paper weight . A whole slew of the pictures featured Russell Piers in various poses , mostly mug shots , although a few had been snapped during more pleasant times . There was even one of him and a younger brother standing in front of the Space Needle . The remaining photos were of Piers 's latest girlfriend - Penny Aldon , the girl from Alien Town . Skinny , pimply , mouthful of braces . A flower child with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in me as I studied the haphazard data , the disheveled photo collection . I felt the pattern , unwholesome as damp cobwebs against my skin . Felt it , yet could n't put a name to it , could n't put my finger on it and my heart began pumping dangerously and I looked away , thought of Carly instead , and how I 'd forgotten to call her on her seventh birthday because I was in Spain with some friends at a Lipizzaner exhibition . Except , I had n't forgotten , I was wired for sound from a snort of primo Colombian blow and the thought of dialing that long string of international numbers was too much for my circuits . Ancient history , as they say . Those days of fast-living and superstar dreams belonged to another man , and he was welcome to them . Waiting for cars to drive past so I could count them , I had an epiphany . I realized the shabby buildings were cardboard and the people milling here and there at opportune junctures were macaroni and glue . Dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't really who I thought of myself as - I was an ant left over from a picnic raid , awaiting some petulant child god to put his boot down on my pathetic diorama existence . My cell rang and an iceberg calved in my chest . " Hey , Ray , you got any Indian in ya ? " Rob asked . I mulled that as a brand new Cadillac convertible paused at the light . A pair of yuppie tourists mildly argued about directions - a man behind the wheel in stylish wraparound shades and a polo shirt , and a woman wearing a floppy , wide-brimmed hat like the Queen Mum favored . They pretended not to notice me . The woman pointed right and they went right , leisurely , up the hill and beyond . " Comanche , " I said . Next was a white econovan loaded with Asian kids . Sign on the door said THE EVERGREEN STATE COLLEGE . It turned right and so did the one that came after . " About one thirty-second .

Thanks , though . " " You okay , bud ? You sound kinda odd . " " Shucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two redneck psychos for weeks . Might be getting to me , I 'll admit . " " Whoa , sorry . Sylvia called and started going on - " " Everything 's hunky-dory , all right ? " " Cool , bro . " Rob 's tone said nothing was truly cool , but he was n't in any position to press the issue . There 'd be a serious Q &A; when I returned , no doubt about it . Cruz 's dad was Basque , was n't he ? Hart was definitely of good , solid German stock only a couple generations removed from the motherland . Stop me if you 've heard this one - a Spaniard , a German , and a Comanche walk into a bar - After we said good-bye , I dialed my ex and got her machine , caught myself and hung up as it was purring . It occurred to me then , what the pattern was , and I stared dumbly down at the fractured portraits of Penny and Piers as their faces were dappled by sunlight falling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How in God 's name had they ever fooled us into thinking they were people at all ? The only things missing from this farce were strings and zippers , a boom mike . I stuffed the photos and the reports into the valise , stood in the weeds at the edge of the asphalt . My blood still pulsed erratically . Shadows began to crawl deep and blue between the buildings and the trees and in the wake of low-gliding cumulus clouds . Moony 's Tavern waited , back there in the golden dust , and Cruz 's Chevy before it , stolid as a coffin on the altar . Something was happening , was n't it ? This thing that was happening , had been happening , could it follow me home if I cut and ran ? Would it follow me to Sylvia and Carly ? No way to be certain , no way to tell if I had simply fallen off my rocker - maybe the heat had cooked my brain , maybe I was having a long-overdue nervous breakdown . Maybe , shit . The sinister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curves of a great killing jar . I heard the lid screwing tight in the endless ultraviolet collisions , the white drone of insects . I turned right and walked up the hill . 5 ABOUT TWO hours later , a guy in a vintage farm truck stopped . The truck had cruised by me twice , once going toward town , then on the way back . And here it was again . I hesitated ; nobody braked for hitchhikers unless the hitcher was a babe in tight jeans . I thought of Piers and Penny , their expressions in the video , drinking us with their smiling mouths , marking us . And if that was true , we 'd been weighed , measured and marked , what was the implication ? Piers and Penny were two from among a swarm . Was it open season ? The driver studied me with unsettling intensity , his beady eyes obscured by thick , black-rimmed glasses . He beckoned . My legs were tired already and the back of my neck itched with sunburn . Also , what did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the hand , I would 've gone into Olympia and caught a southbound Greyhound . I climbed aboard . George was a retired civil engineer . Looked the part - crewcut , angular face like a piece of rock , wore a dress shirt with a row of clipped pens and a tie flung over his shoulder , and polyester slacks . He kept NPR on the radio at a mumble . Gripped the wheel with both gnarled hands . Seemed familiar - a figure dredged from memories of scientists and engineers of my grandfather 's generation . He could 've been my grandfather . I did n't study him too closely . George asked me where I was headed . I said Los Angeles and he gave me a glance that said L. A. was in the opposite direction . I told him I wanted to visit the Mima Mounds - since I was in the neighborhood . There was a heavy silence . A vast and unfathomable pressure built in the cab . At last George said , " Why , they 're only a couple miles farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I admitted that I did n't and he said he figured as much . He told me the Mounds were declared a national monument back in the " 60s ; the subject of scholarly debate and wildly inaccurate hypotheses . He hoped I would n't be disappointed - they were n't glamorous compared to real natural wonders such as Niagara Falls , the Grand Canyon , or the California Redwoods . The preserve was on the order of five hundred acres , but that was nothing . The Mounds had stretched for miles and miles in the old days . The land grabs of the 189Os reduced the phenomenon to a pocket , surrounded it with rundown farms , pastures , and cows . The ruins of America 's agrarian era . I said that it would be impossible to disappoint me . George turned at a wooden marker with a faded white arrow . A nicely paved single lane wound through temperate rain forest for a mile and looped into a parking lot occupied by the Evergreen vans and a few other vehicles . There was a fence with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing . Official bulletins were posted every six feet , prohibiting dogs , alcohol , and firearms . " Sure you want me to leave you here ? " " I 'll be fine . " George rustled , his clothes chitin sloughing . " X marks the spot . " I did n't regard him , my hand frozen on the door handle , more than slightly afraid the door would n't open . Time slowed , got stuck in molasses . " I know a secret , George . " " What kind of secret ? " George said , too close , as if he 'd leaned in tight . The hairs stiffened on the nape of my neck . I swallowed and closed my eyes . " I saw a picture in a biology textbook . There was this bug , looked exactly like a piece of bark , and it was barely touching a beetle with its nose . The one that resembled bark was what entomologists call an assassin bug and it was draining the beetle dry . Know how ? It poked the beetle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rostrum , you mean . " " Exactly . A rostrum , or a proboscis , depending on the species . Then the assassin bug injected digestive fluids , think hydrochloric acid , and sucked the beetle 's insides out . " " How lovely , " George said . " No struggle , no fuss , just a couple bugs sitting on a branch . So I 'm staring at this book and thinking the only reason the beetle got caught was because it fell for the old piece of bark trick , and then I realized that 's how lots of predatory bugs operate . They camouflage themselves and sneak up on hapless critters to do their thing . " " Is n't that the way of the universe ? " " And I wondered if that theory only applied to insects . " " What do you suppose ? " " I suspect that theory applies to everything . " Zilch from George . Not even the rasp of his breath . " Bye , George . Thanks for the ride . " I pushed hard to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backward glance . My knees were unsteady . After I passed through the gate and approached a bend in the path , I finally had the nerve to check the parking lot . George 's truck was gone . I kept going , almost falling forward . The trees thinned to reveal the humpbacked plain from the TV picture . Nearby was a concrete bunker shaped like a squat mushroom - a park information kiosk and observation post . It was papered with articles and diagrams under plexiglass . Throngs of brightly clad Asian kids buzzed around the kiosk , laughing over the wrinkled flyers , pointing cameras and chattering enthusiastically . A shaggy guy in a hemp sweater , presumably the professor , lectured a couple of wind-burned ladies who obviously ran marathons in their spare time . The ladies were enthralled . I mounted the stairs to the observation platform and scanned the environs . As George predicted , the view was n't staggering . The mounds spread beneath my vantage , none greater than five or six feet in height and largely engulfed in blackberry brambles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest , and toward the narrowing end , a dilapidated trailer court , its structures rendered toys by perspective . The paved footpath coiled unto obscurity . A radio-controlled airplane whirred in the trailer court airspace . The plane 's engine throbbed , a shrill metronome . I squinted against the glare , could n't discern the operator . My skull ached . I slumped , hugged the valise to my chest , pressed my cheek against damp concrete , and drowsed . Shoes scraped along the platform . Voices occasionally floated by . Nobody challenged me , my derelict posture . I had n't thought they would . Who 'd dare disturb the wildlife in this remote enclave ? My sluggish daydreams were phantoms of the field , negatives of its buckled hide and stealthy plants , and the whispered words Eastern Washington , South America , Norway . Scientists might speculate about the geological method of the mounds " creation until doomsday . I knew this place and its sisters were unnatural as monoliths hacked from rude stone by primitive hands and stacked like so many dominoes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breeding grounds , feeding grounds , shrines ? Or something utterly alien , something utterly incomprehensible to match the blighted fascination that dragged me ever closer and consumed my will to flee . Hart 's call yanked me from the doldrums . He was drunk . " You shoulda stuck around , Ray-bo . We been huntin " everywhere for you . Cruz ai n't in a nice mood . " The connection was weak , a transmission from the dark side of Pluto . Batteries were dying . " Where are you ? " I rubbed my gummy eyes and stood . " We 're at the goddamned Mounds . Where are you ? " I spied a tiny glint of moving metal . The Chevy rolled across the way where the road and the mobile homes intersected . I smiled - Cruz had n't been looking for me ; he 'd been trolling around on the wrong side of the park , frustrated because he 'd missed the entrance . As I watched , the car slowed and idled in the middle of the road . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Geiger counter that 'd hit the mother lode . Bits of fiddle music pierced the garble . The car jolted from a savage tromp on the gas and listed ditchward . It accelerated , jounced and bounded into the field , described a haphazard arc in my direction . I had a momentary terror that they 'd seen me atop the tower , were coming for me , were planning some unhinged brand of retribution . But no , the distance was too great . I was no more than a speck , if I was anything . Soon , the car lurched behind the slope of intervening hillocks and did n't emerge . " Hart , are you there ? " The clicking intensified and abruptly chopped off , replaced by smooth , bottomless static . Deep sea squeals and warbles began to filter through . Bees humming . A castrati choir on a gramophone . Giggling . Someone , perhaps Cruz , whispering a Latin prayer . I was grateful when the phone made an electronic protest and expired . I hurled it over the side . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his admirers . I might 've joined the migration if I had n't spotted the cab of George 's truck mostly hidden by a tree . It was the only rig in the parking lot . I could n't tell if anyone was behind the wheel . The sun hung low and fat , reddening as it sank . The breeze had cooled . It plucked at my hair , dried my sweat , chilled me a little . I listened for the roar of the Chevy , buried to the axles in loose dirt , high-centered on a stump ; or perhaps they 'd abandoned the vehicle . Thus I strained to pick my companions from among the blackberry patches and softly undulating clumps of scotch broom which had invaded this place too . Quiet . I went down the stairs and let the path take me . I went as a man in a stupor , my muscles lethargic with dread . The lizard subprocessor in my brain urged me to sprint for the highway , to scuttle into a burrow . It possessed a hint of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times before . I whistled a dirge through clenched teeth and the mounds closed ranks behind me . Ahead , came the dull clank of a slamming door . The car was stalled at the foot of a steep slope , its hood buried in a tangle of brush . The windows were dark as a muddy aquarium and festooned with fleshy creepers and algid scum . I took root a few yards from the car , noting that the engine was dead , yet the vehicle rocked on its springs from some vigorous activity . A rhythmic motion that caused metal to complain . The brake lights stuttered . Hart 's doughy face materialized on the passenger side , bumped against the glass with the dispassion of a pale , exotic fish , and withdrew , descending into a marine trench . His forehead left a starry impact . Someone 's palm smacked the rear window , hung there , fingers twitching . I retreated . Ran , more like . I may have shrieked . Somewhere along the line the valise flew open and its contents spilled - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for Father 's Day , my toiletries . A handful of photographs pinwheeled in a gust . I dropped the bag . Ungainly , panicked , I did n't get far , tripped and collapsed as the sky blackened and a high-pitched keening erupted from several locations simultaneously . In moments all ambient light had been sucked away ; I could n't see the thorny bush gouging my neck as I wriggled for cover , could n't make out my own hand before my eyes . The keening ceased . Peculiar echoes bounced in its wake , gave me the absurd sensation of lying on a sound stage with the kliegs shut off . I received the impression of movement around my hunkered self , although I did n't hear footsteps . I shuddered , pressed my face deeper into musty soil . Ants investigated my pants cuffs . Cruz called my name from the throat of a distant tunnel . I knew it was n't him and kept silent . He cursed me and giggled the unpleasant giggle I 'd heard on the phone . Hart tried to coax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went down the entire list and despite everything I was tempted to answer when Carly began crying and hiccuping and begging me to help her , Daddy please , in a baby girl voice she had n't owned for several years . I stuffed my fist in my mouth , held on while the chorus drifted here and there and eventually receded into the buzz and chirr of field life . The sun flickered on and the world was restored piecemeal - one root , one stump , one hill at a time . My head swam ; reminded me of waking from anesthesia . Dusk was blooming when I crept from the bushes and tasted the air , cocked an ear for predators . The Chevy was there , shimmering in the twilight . Motionless now . I could 've crouched in my blind forever , wild-eyed as a hare run to ground in a ruined shirt and piss-stained slacks . But it was getting cold and I was thirsty , so I slunk across the park at an angle that took me to the road near the trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pursuit that never came . 6 . I TOLD A RETIREE sipping ice tea in a lawn chair that my car had broken down and he let me use his phone to call a taxi . If he witnessed Cruz crash the Chevy into the Mounds , he was n't saying . The police did n't show while I waited and that said enough about the situation . The taxi driver was a stolid Samoan who proved not the least bit interested in my frightful appearance or talking . He drove way too fast for comfort , if I 'd been in a rational frame of mind , and dropped me at the Greyhound depot in downtown Olympia . I wandered inside past the rag-tag gaggle of modern gypsies which inevitably haunted these terminals , studied the big board while the ticket agent pursed her lips in distaste . Her expression certified me as one of the unwashed mob . I picked Seattle at random , bought a ticket . The ticket got me the key to the restroom , where I splashed my welted flesh , combed cat tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fluorescent tube crackled and sizzled , threatened to plunge the crummy toilet into darkness , and in the discotheque flashes , my haggard face seemed strange . The bus arrived an hour late and it was crammed . I shared a seat with a middle-aged woman in a shawl and a bucket of costume jewelry . Her ivory skin was hard and she smelled of chlorine . I did n't imagine she wanted to sit by me , judging from the flare of her nostrils , the crimp of her over-glossed mouth . Soon the bus was chugging into the wasteland of night and the lights clicked off row by row as passengers succumbed to sleep . Except some guy near the front who left his overhead lamp on to read , and me . I was too exhausted to close my eyes . I surprised myself by crying . And the woman surprised me again by murmuring , " Hush , hush , dear . Hush , hush . " She patted my trembling shoulder . Her hand lingered . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
