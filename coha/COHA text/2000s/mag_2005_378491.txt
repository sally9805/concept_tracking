As an anchor and writer for 14 years at ABC and NBC , Linda Ellerbee achieved her own kind of fame as a television personality  --  outspoken , irreverent and insightful . She was a real-life Murphy Brown , and the rumor was that she inspired the sitcom . This month Ellerbee , 60 , comes out with a new book , Take Big Bites : Adventures Around the World and Across the Table . She spoke with TIME 's ANDREA SACHS about an array of topics , from women in TV news to her battle with cancer . <P> Have things changed for women on TV ? <P> It 's easier to be a woman in television news today than it was when I started . There is no question about it , and the pay is better . It will be interesting to see  --  now that Dan Rather has left , and Tom Brokaw has left , and Peter Jennings is off at least temporarily  --  after the all-male anchor troika , whether any of those people are replaced by women . <P> What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it will be a single anchor . There are not a lot of programs on television news where there 's just one anchor and it 's a woman . As far as I know , Nick News a children 's program on Nickelodeon that Ellerbee has anchored for 14 years may be the longest-running program on national television anchored solely by a woman . I 'm lucky . I have a really smart audience . They do n't care how old I am . Anyone over 20 looks old to them . <P> What has getting older been like for you ? <P> Turning 40 never bothered me . Turning 50 never bothered me . I think what bothered me about turning 60 was the complete realization that there really were n't an unlimited number of summers left  --  or an unlimited number of Saturday nights . It made me angry . It did n't matter how healthy I was at 60 . I probably would n't be that healthy at 70 . You can put a good face on it . You can say , " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as I live and live as hard as I can and have as much fun as I can for as long as I live , " but you ca n't really pretend that you 're 30 again . <P> Marriage : for it or against it ? <P> I married four times between the ages of 19 and 29 . I never married again . Rolfe Tessem , a former network-news producer and director and I are celebrating 19 years together in September , but we have never married . I think I 've discovered the secret . I 'm not very good at marriage . Why ruin a good thing ? We own a production company together . We live together . We love each other . Our lives are joined in many , many ways . I do n't know how we could be more married . <P> How did being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992 change your life ? <P> I became fitter . I began to work out , take care of my body more . It may be corny , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of stopping to smell the flowers . Because if you 're not careful , life will speed right back up on you , and you will forget how lucky you are to be on the right side of the grass each morning . <P> You 've traveled all over the world . How important has that been for you ? <P> Enormously important . We grew up in a culture where everyone said , particularly if you were a little girl , " Do n't talk to strangers . " It was my father who taught me that once you talked to them , they were no longer strangers . I 've made a hell of a good living over the years talking to strangers .
