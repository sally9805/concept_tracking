When Nick Faldo walked the legendary courses where he evidenced his brilliance , his head down in deep concentration , he was criticized for being a cold fish . When he practiced relentlessly on the range , seeking perfection , he was tabbed a selfish loner . When he won with brilliant golf and stunning emotional control , he was told he had no feeling for his fellow man . That 's not the Nick Faldo I know , and now that he is 45 and no longer grinding to be number one , the rest of the world is seeing a more relaxed Faldo , too . When I arrived for our interview at the Faldo Golf Institute by Marriott in Orlando , Florida , Nick was happily mugging for the camera and cooperating with the photographer . When I returned home afterward , I found that Nick had called , leaving a message to say thanks and to wish me a happy weekend . Typical Faldo . How successfully has the new , funny , affectionate , warm Nick Faldo been playing out ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in evidence lately . I was a serious golfer , obviously , and then the last five or six years I 've been through serious ups and downs . When I met Valerie his wife of two years the transformation began , and I 'm still learning to unwind . Our baby is due in August and our life together is incredible . I know what stage I 'm at in my career , what my playing capabilities are . I have to let go of the level golfer I was a little bit to be happy with what I 've got . Is there anything you 're going to do differently this go-around as a husband and father ? Totally . It is a massive and difficult job handling a woman . When they say , " no , " do they really mean no ? When they say , " yes , " what kind of yes is it ? And when they ask a question , you ca n't just answer it . You have to work out in a split second what kind of answer they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic guy , Kjell Enhager , who has become one of my truest and closest friends . He is a sports and corporate psychologist who has been working with me on the golf course for almost four years . We go off for a session on golf and the first half is really about how to handle the wives . It 's much more complicated and exhausting than the golf . It 's reassuring to see that I 'm not the only guy who is lost sometimes about human and marital relationships . The bottom line is that I care for her so much and I just want to make sure I do everything I can to make her happy . What do you want to try to do differently as a dad ? Well , that has been a tough one . Unfortunately , being a professional golfer is not the best career if you want to spend a lot of time at home with your children . You have to be away from them for what sometimes seems like an eternity . But it 's your job . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my first three children . Then going through a divorce from his second wife , Gill did n't help at all . They grow up so fast . Now I have to fit into their busy schedules . But when I spend time with them , they get absolute priority . I 'll do what any other dad does : the school runs , the rugby or cricket matches , the school plays . If I have to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to work on my grips in order to be there for them at 7 o'clock , I 'll do it . With our new baby , everything will be easier . My whole life is changing now . I have a better balance between golf , business and family life . I lived in London when Faldo was starting out and remember well the treatment he received from a cruel and unfair press corps . " El Foldo " they called him . They openly rooted against him . The British press targeted you in your early days . It was particularly ugly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drip out onto the paper ? " Now they want to do lifestyle pieces . Apparently they have changed , which is great for me and for the good of civilization . Tell me the impetus for overhauling your swing in the mid-1980s . In 1983 , I was tied for the lead in the British Open and could n't handle it . The next spring I was right there at Augusta playing the last group with Ben Crenshaw and I saw what it takes to win a major . Then I won at Hilton Head and had an up-and-down season , but it hit me at the end of 1984 . That little voice said , " You ai n't got it , mate . " I saw David Leadbetter in Sun City South Africa and briefly spoke to him . I said , " What do you think ? " He said , " Well this is causing this and that is causing that . " So I realized there was a chain reaction of things that needed to be worked on . I thought about it while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muirfield Village at the Memorial . I said I was ready . That started that little transformation of beating a million balls in two years or whatever . But it was n't a little thing . It was the biggest golf decision you have made . You put a lot of trust in this guy . Exactly . I was his guinea pig . He had new theories , which he has changed over the years . So that beginning was a massive experiment . But I put the work in and so , of course , did David . Why did you decide to trust him ? The way he explained it to me . A lot of people , I call Band-Aid teachers . I realized it was more than that . I wanted to get to the root of it and fix it properly . He communicated well . That was very important . It was right to trust him . We both became number one at what we do . What could n't you handle at Birkdale in 1983 ? My swing just did n't stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed it . Was there a shot or a series of things that told you there were real problems ? It was a series of things . You can tell by playing against Tom Watson how you measure up . My swing was just unreliable  --  my assets were my hands and my tempo . I am a tall guy and so I had a lot of moving parts because the arms and legs did n't always want to work together . I survived on timing . It was n't repetitive enough . It was n't **27;323;TOOLONG material . You won the 1987 British Open after your overhaul . What is the strongest memory of winning your first major ? Waiting at 18 after I finished to see if I 've won or lost or have to go to a playoff . The only way I can describe the sensation is when you fortunately just missed having a car accident and you get that whole flood of everything through your body . I could n't watch the TV . I sat with my head literally between my knees . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next 15 seconds were going to change one of these guys ' lives . We know what happened . Faldo won when Paul Azinger bogeyed the 18th . My life certainly changed . It 's funny that a number of really good players have not played their best when paired with you . Scott Hoch 's missed putt in the 1989 Masters playoff . Ray Floyd hitting into the water in The Masters playoff in 1990 . Greg Norman shooting 78 in 1996 in the final round . Are you that scary ? I think I must be , yeah . I 'm sure it 's the same as Jack Nicklaus . The number one ability Jack had was that he played the same game Sunday afternoon . When the pressure mounts , you continue playing the same game . So the guy you 're playing with , he must be thinking , " This guy is all right . We know he can handle it . So I ca n't make a mistake . " As soon as you start thinking about the other player , it has affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was still able to keep producing on Sunday afternoon . That 's what I did best and Jack did best and very few others were able to do it . How did you feel playing with Jack in the last round of the 1990 Masters , considering that he influenced you to take up golf as a 14-year-old and he was , at the time , the only one to win back-to-back Masters , as you were trying to do that year ? I found it a great omen . There I am trying to equal a record , and he 's right there . It 's quite funny how I get the reputation for not talking to guys on the course , but I was n't the only one . On that occasion , Jack , who is the gentleman of gentlemen , was so focused trying to win that he did n't say boo to me until the 12th hole . The pressure of the 12th is enormous . I said to him , " God , I 'm glad we do n't play this hole every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been playing it for 30 years . " Yes , to win there was very special . I actually asked that Jack present the jacket to me . But they said , " No , it will have to be the chairman . " How were you able to play your best on Sunday afternoons ? It 's focus . Then it becomes mental . If I trusted my swing , it gave me my mental strength . I have always had the strength to be very powerful in my visualization and in my commitment . In two of your three Masters victories , 1989 and 1996 , you came from 5 and 6 back in the final round . And I ca n't remember a better final round in the last 10 years than your 67 in 1996 . Do n't people realize you 're just a birdie machine ? The last round is the time to make things happen . For any great player in any sport , you have this ability for a period in your career when you can make things happen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a way to give it away . What do you do best now ? Walking . Even at 45 I 'm a lovely mover . No , I 'm actually doing a lot of things very well . A lot of things have improved the last couple of years . I said to myself : " OK , if we 're going to keep playing out the end of this career , let 's really pick out the best stuff from 10 years ago and just do it . " So I changed my attitude about putting . I used to see you on the practice green with rulers and all sorts of crazy training aids . You need the technical side . You need the trust in your stroke . Once you have the trust you have to work on pace and reading greens . If I have something that is working , I 'm not going to fiddle so much . It 's a bit late to start going off into the wilderness and start finding something new . It 's the same with my swing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got to be happy with what I 've got and keep doing it . You 've been number one . What are your thoughts on Tiger Woods , the new number one ? Well , he is phenomenal . I think he has got the whole Tour beat because he has led what , 30 tournaments after three rounds and won 28 of them . In the majors , it 's 8 for 8 . So , he sent the message and everybody is consciously or subconsciously talking themselves out of it . " Well , he 's never blown one , so how can the rest of us have a chance ? " What did you think when Tiger revamped his swing after winning the 1997 Masters by 12 shots ? He 's really helped me because when I used to go through all my swing changes , they all used to say , " What an idiot . What is he thinking ? " Then Tiger does that and they say , " Maybe Faldo was right . " That 's why I like Tiger . Ben Hogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have a personality and talk to the crowd . Are n't you like that , too ? Exactly . I felt I was better if I was cocooned . Totally focused . I had n't learned to switch on and off . Now , Kjell tells me , " I could have taught you that . " You have a trigger to switch back on to it . You watch a lot of any of the great athletes  --  Bjorn Borg used to just spin his racket and it reset him . I never learned that in those days . After the 1996 Masters , you hit a dry spell , winning only once since . What happened ? Well , a lot was happening in my life . I hit the " dark years " and the divorce . You can imagine the emotion of the divorce . You have the children involved , the financial things . Then I hit a run of bad business decisions , counting my chickens before they hatched with the Adams thing Faldo signed a 10-year agreement with Adams Golf in 1998 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped using its clubs . I went through more bad management problems parting with long-time manager John Simpson in 2001 . So it has been an ongoing battle . It is only now that we really can say that we have a handle on things . It 's good to learn from your mistakes . I say to my kids , I said to Matthew 14 , " If you 've got any problems just ask me because I 'll tell you what , son , I 've been through it . I 've had people betray me  --  friends of 25 years . I have n't seen everything but , boy , I 've seen a lot . Please ask me for an opinion on things , my son . " Among 40-odd international victories , Faldo has nine wins on the PGA Tour ; six of those are majors . The other three came at Riviera , Doral and Hilton Head . He 's won more Ryder Cup matches than anyone . What player of his generation would n't trade records with him ? Do you have any doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must admit that my record looks pretty good on paper , and yes , I am very proud of it . But as we all know , golf does n't work like that . When I was winning majors and ranked world number one , I was " the man . " But as soon as you feel you are off your game and you see the other guys winning , you sure do n't feel like you 're the man anymore . In golf , once you think you 've got it , the golfing gods remind you that really you do n't . And that is precisely the time the press chooses to beat on you and tries to bury you . " The fallen star . " " The forgotten hero . " All those headlines . Once I said , " I 'm terribly sorry guys , but I 'm still out here because I enjoy it . " Then they did a 180 . Then it was , " Well , look at that . He 's 45 now and he 's still out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " And somehow they start admiring that perseverance and determination . If anyone ever says that Greg Norman or Nick Price was the best player of your era , how do you react ? I think the obvious one is you have majors to be counted and you have rankings to review . Greg was the best in the early to mid-1980s , and I beat his record for consecutive weeks at the top of the World Ranking with 81 . Price was very good . It was him , Greg and Fred Couples of that period . But hey , I have as many majors six as the three of them combined . Ha , ha ! Are you surprised that those guys did n't win more majors ? Yes , because they were great players . I could n't really answer why . It was a feather in everybody 's cap to beat Greg , so everybody chipped in against him . But again , it comes down to playing your best game on Sunday afternoon and very few players in history could do that . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was Greg , Price , Freddie , but there were a couple of times  --  1993 at Royal St. George 's won by Norman and St. Andrews in 1990 won by Faldo  --  when I thought if I beat one man this week , Greg Norman , great . The 1996 Masters was n't a good example because I was throwing my clubs in the practice round . It was all going wrong and I went into lunch and sat with a friend and he said to me , " Just remember you are Nick Faldo . " I still was n't confident going to the first tee on Thursday . To come off with a 68 in the first round was the breakthrough of the week . On Tuesday I ca n't hit a shot and on Thursday I 'm Nick Faldo again . Why do you suppose your major record is one of the best ever ? That was my goal . To win major championships . That was what I committed myself to . You 're measured by the majors , and I was able to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very proud of the 1990 Masters . Defending champion . That was n't just show up and play . To win the British Open in 1990 was an intention . I had missed out in the U.S. Open . I vowed after that I was going to win the British Open . Then in 1992 it was the same thing at the British Open as I went in as the favorite . So , those three I 'm very proud of . That is a very different ball game than just going to the majors and saying , " Hmm , things feel pretty good this week . Let 's see what happens . " How nice is it to be working with caddie Fanny Sunesson again ? Ah , Fanny . She 's like a baby sister , really . She saved me on all sorts of things . She saved my relationship with Valerie . How so ? Well , without going into the details , she convinced Valerie of the sincerity of my feelings for her . She stopped Valerie at a tournament and told her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen him like this . I can tell that this is the real thing and we must make it happen ! " She stepped in when I needed her most . Tell me about your wine business . I did the proper tasting , which was great fun . I 'm not one of the experts we 're relying upon . But I was there . I tasted it . I spat it out . So it 's a genuine Faldo selection . Do you drink ? I enjoy my wine , my whiskey , my beers , but I 'm pretty disciplined . The last time I was drunk was New Year 's Eve 1993 . Seriously drunk when you 're lying on the floor counting chocolates . Had a little buzz , Nick ? I made punch . I made red punch and white punch . People tasted the white punch , which was like if you breathed out the wallpaper fell off the wall . Nobody was drinking the red one , either , so I just mixed them . It was like rocket fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in moderation . I 'll have a glass or two . I have known you for almost 10 years now . You seem the happiest you 've ever been , the most comfortable in your own skin . Exactly . I was a fierce competitor . My regret , if it is a regret , is that I never got the chance to know Greg , Seve , Price and the other guys very well . Any other regrets ? Wow . A million things . I would love to change relationships with people and girlfriends and the way I 've handled business decisions . You do things and later figure out everything could be done differently . But there is no practice round in life . Tell us about ex-girlfriend Brenna Cepelak , the University of Arizona player with whom you had a tumultuous relationship . She was a piece of work . She smashed the windshield of your Porsche with your 9-iron , then took off . My mind was so scrambled . Alarm bells were going off around me and I was going , " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I needed Big Ben to just squash me before I suddenly went , " Oh , is that what 's going on ? " How did you and Seve get along ? I have the utmost respect for him and wish we could have been friends  --  we were fierce competitors and very different mentalities , obviously . Now , it saddens me because he has beaten himself down so hard . I 'd love to be able to give him my two pounds ' worth . He needs to make a decision now to put his career in a better place , so people respect that period when he was so great . I would advise him to disappear to a tropical island , someplace that he loves . Take the family and coach and friends and psychologist . Have fun with it . Work hard and relax hard as well . Do you feel like you smelled enough flowers along the way ? I 'm going to make sure I do smell a lot of life 's flowers from now on .
