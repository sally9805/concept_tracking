If the pace of invention continues at the rate suggested by the preceding pages , the world will become a really boring place . The human species needs its daily grapplings with the illogical , the clunky , the imperfect if it is to preserve that which separates us from animals and household appliances . Man likes doing some things the hard way , the wrong way , the old-fashioned way . And too often , an invention that solves one superficial problem creates profound new others . Four new inventions in particular must be blocked at all costs if humanity as we know it is to survive . <P> 1 ) THE NONRECALCITRANT TOASTER : Somebody soon is bound to smash the worldwide **25;12394;TOOLONG cartel 's plot to foist $50 toasters built with 10cent engineering on a groggy breakfast-time America . The prospect of a toaster that quickly pops up perfect golden-brown slices every time is to be dreaded . Will the toaster swallow the slice , then hold it in its stubborn grip until it 's a hunk of smoking charcoal ? How many times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to see it instantly pop back up again ? Set the dial to WELL DONE , and the " toast " that emerges five long minutes later is pale yellow . Exactly ! The recalcitrant toaster must not die . It 's this very duel of wits between man and machine , the struggle to outguess the little bastard 's endless treacheries , that snaps the dozing mind awake every morning , sharpening it for the challenges of the day ahead . <P> 2 ) THE HIP PILOT : All that 's keeping the human element alive in an ever more relentlessly robotic info-storage world is a few square inches of warm , floppy leather in our hip pocket : the wallet . The wallet , where strangers ' business cards go to be forgotten , where 10,000-lire bills from a three-year-old Italian vacation retire , where 1997 restaurant receipts and 1994 family snapshots dwell . Where it takes 10 minutes not to find what you 're looking for amid the detritus stuffed over the years into that labyrinth of folds and pockets . And where , occasionally , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet some high-tech smarty-pants is close to hatching the archefficient Hip Pilot , the virtual wallet , the transformation of all that comforting confusion into so many tiny green symbols on a handheld thingamajig . It ca n't happen . It must not happen . <P> 3 ) THE PERFECTED HOME PICTUREPHONE : Any day now , engineers are going to figure out how to make videophones cheap enough for someone besides the chairman of Goldman Sachs to use at home . But " now " is the postderegulation telephonic age and the heyday of high-powered telemarketing . Do you have any idea what this means once the Picturephone becomes a common household appliance ? It means : " Hi , I 'm Kathie Lee Gifford singing the Trans-Vox Long Distance Weekend Offer Song ! " " It 's me , John Madden , inviting you to sign up now for a low-interest KashKard ! " " Got a minute ? I 'd like to show you how Lightfinger Securities can double your income  --  in hours ! " It means , in short , the power of both spoken word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more annoying , unsolicited dinnertime calls . Still want the Picturephone ?
