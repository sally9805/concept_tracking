The Stray Linda Evans Dr. Scott MacDallan was , by dint of much sweating and swearing , trying to turn a wriggling , ungrateful little demon of a breech-birth infant for head-down delivery , when the stray arrived on the doorstep . Mrs. Zivonik had a history of easy births without complications or he 'd have done a simple Caesarian , but turning an infant was n't complicated and the monitors in place showed him neither baby nor mother were in distress , so rather than create an incision and put the woman out of work for several days , he simply took the time-honored step of reaching in for the baby , grabbing it in one hand , and rotating it right-end around instead of wrong-side down . Mrs. Zivonik was doing fine , too , was even cracking terrible jokes despite the sheen of sweat soaking her and the occasional sharp grunts , gasps , and deeper groans when the contractions hit . Scott had just touched the baby 's toes and was wondering why he 'd ever thought this would be easy -- while trying to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional anguish strong enough to knock him cock-eyed rolled over Scott like a naval battle cruiser . His involuntary grunt and sharp movement drew a startled sound from his patient . " Doc ? " Scott blinked , fighting the urge to panic , and managed , " Uh , sorry . No problems , you 're fine and the baby 's fine . " For God 's sake , Scott , pull it together ! Before your patient thinks you 're as loony as your misbegotten ancestors . Some of them had been burned at the stake ... Scott blinked as Evelina Zivonik leaned up far enough to peer over the top of her distended belly . " That 's good . But you do n't look fine . " Just beyond the bedroom door of the Zivonik home , Fisher -- who had the run of Scott 's home and office , but not of his patients ' homes -- began bleeking in acute distress . He 'd never heard the treecat make a sound quite like it , in fact , and the emotional wallop he was getting from his companion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not fine . Or rather , my treecat is n't . " " Your treecat ? " she echoed . A thread of fear colored those two words . Treecats were viewed with awe and no small measure of worry by their human neighbors , who were almost universally uncertain how to respond to their presence . " Yes . He 's upset , very upset , I 'm not sure why . " Careful , Scott ... you 're treading thin ice here . " I 've never heard him make a noise like that , " he added , glancing worriedly toward the closed bedroom door . " Well , I 'm not actually in serious labor yet , " Evelina said uncertainly , the worry stronger this time . " If there 's a problem with the treecat , you need to go find out what it is . If he 's hurt or sick ... well , I 'm not exactly going anywhere , so you should find out what it is . " His professional ethics would permit no such conduct , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure just to comfort his friend was out of the question . But Fisher 's deep distress was not to be denied . Fisher knew how to open doors , of course , and the bedroom door was closed , but was n't locked . Scott hesitated , torn between the need to reassure himself that a treasured friend was n't in peril and the need to bring this baby into the world . " Why do n't you call him in here ? " Evelina suggested , correctly interpreting his hesitation . " Irina has told us all about Fisher and showed us pictures , but I 've never actually seen a live treecat . " The hint of wistfulness in her voice decided Scott in an instant . He flashed her a grateful response . " Thanks . Fisher ! Come on inside , Fisher , it 's not locked ! " The door swung open and a cream-and-grey furred streak shot across the floor on collision course with Scott 's shoulder . He grunted softly at the impact , one hand still trapped in Evelina Zivonik 's womb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bleek ! " The treecat touched his cheek with both front hands , then pointed urgently at the window . " What ? Is there some danger outside ? " That was n't the feeling he was getting from his companion of nearly twelve Terran months , now . He was getting better at reading Fisher 's emotional " messages " all the time , thanks to an empathic ability of some sort that he carried in his extremely Celtic Scots Highland genes -- an " ability " that still scared him silly on a rational , scientific level . The first time it 'd happened with Fisher , he 'd literally thought he was hallucinating . Only later did the truth sink in -- and that was almost worse than a hallucination . On Sphinx , the kind of legacy he 'd inherited from a long line of charlatans , parlor tricksters , and other assorted loons was met with mere skepticism and ridicule . But there were human worlds where professing to ownership of anything remotely similar to what his more ... flamboyant ... relatives ( all on his mother 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDallan had n't been connected with them ) was punishable by incarceration for fraud -- or outright insanity . What he was getting from Fisher now was not so much a sense that there was some kind of danger outside as more a sense that something outside was in danger . Or distress , maybe . It was also abundantly clear that Fisher wanted him to go outside , urgently . " Fisher , I ca n't go outside right now . I 'm trying to deliver a baby . " Grass-green eyes shone brilliant with distress . The treecat made a pitiful sound . Just then , a chorus of childish voices erupted out in the main part of the house . " Daddy ! Come quick ! " " It 's a treecat , Daddy ! " " Aunt Irina ! Hurry ! There 's a treecat outside ! " " He 's hurt or sick or something ! Hurry , Daddy ! Hurry , Aunt Irina ! " Scott and Evelina Zivonik exchanged startled glances . " Go , " Evelina said firmly . " I 've had six babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , whether you sit here and sweat to death with worrying or take five minutes to go out there and maybe save a life . You 're the only doctor for a hundred kilometers . If there 's an injured treecat out there , then it needs you more than I do right now . Besides , " and she gave him a wry , sweaty grin , " I could use a breather from all that mauling . " Scott flushed ; he 'd continued working to turn the baby even while trying to determine what was wrong with Fisher , and " mauling " was probably what it felt like to poor Evelina Zivonik . Fisher touched his cheek again . " Bleek ? " The sound tugged at his heart , not to be denied . " Thanks , " he said with heartfelt sincerity . " I 've never seen Fisher this upset . I 'll be right back . " He eased his hand out of Mrs. Zivonik 's womb , reaching for a towel with the other . That bit about Fisher being more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ; but Scott did n't like talking about the injuries he 'd suffered the day he and Fisher had first made one another 's memorable acquaintance . The treecat had saved Scott MacDallan 's life . The very least he could do was repay the favor to a treecat in trouble . So he hurriedly scrubbed off and jogged outside , where the Zivonik brood danced around their father and Aleksandr Zivonik 's younger sister , Irina Kisaevna . Aleksandr and Irina stood a good twenty yards to the side of the house , peering up into a picket wood tree 's lower branches . Scott had no more than cleared the doorjamb than the most anguished sound he had ever heard uttered by a living creature smote him straight through the skull bones . The sound keened up and down like a banshee driven insane , voice torn by more pain than can be endured . Fisher , who huddled on his shoulder , wrapped his tail around Scott 's throat and shuddered non-stop . " Bleek ! " Scott broke into a run , even while reaching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " Aleksandr pointed . Scott peered up into the tall picket wood closest to the Zivonik house , toward one of the long , perfectly horizontal branches that made the picket wood so unusual among trees . " Up there . " Scott had to look closely , but he spotted the treecat near the trunk , sitting up on its haunches like an old Terran ferret , longer and leaner than one of those ancient weasels , yet with a head and certain other characteristics far more feline -- except , of course , for the six limbs , a trait it shared with the massive and deadly Sphinxian hexapuma it so closely resembled in all but size . The treecat keening in the Zivoniks ' backyard picket wood was larger than Fisher , about seventy centimeters long , not counting the prehensile tail , which effectively doubled its length , yet the little arboreal was far too thin for its length . It did look sick -- or injured . Its coat was mottled cream-and-grey , like Fisher 's , but even from this distance , Scott could see dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher ? " he murmured , trying to soothe his small friend 's violent tremors . " Is it hurt ? If I could get to it , treat it ... " The hair-raising cries halted . The strange treecat made a pitiful sound , tiny with distance , then moved haltingly down the trunk toward the ground . Scott 's pulse raced . He wanted to break into a run , wanted to rush toward it , and was afraid of frightening it away . " Aleksandr , " he said in a low voice , " I think maybe you and Irina should take the children back to the house . If anything spooks it , we may never get a chance to help , and I think that treecat needs help very badly . " Aleksandr nodded . The set of his mouth was grim . " Come on , kids . And no arguments ! " Irina Kisaevna glanced involuntarily toward Scott , concern darkening her vivid blue eyes . Of all the humans Scott had met before being adopted by Fisher , Irina alone seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable creature who 'd come into his life nearly a full Terran year previously . Widowed when her husband had died in the plague that had devastated the human population of Sphinx , Irina had become a close friend during the past couple of years . Scott enjoyed her company , her quick , incisive mind , and her ability to make him feel rested and at ease , even after a difficult day ; but when Evelina 's latest pregnancy had turned difficult , she had moved in with her brother on the Zivoniks ' farmstead -- thus depriving Scott of her delightful company and occasionally intuitive insights into his relationship with his treecat . " Irina , " he said quickly , " I 'd appreciate your help . " Warmth flashed into her beautiful eyes . " Of course , Scott . It would be my privilege . " She , too , peered toward the slowly descending treecat in the big picket wood tree above them . Scott waited while Aleksandr herded his youngsters back toward the house , The whimpering treecat had reached the lowest branch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher replied , then pointed . Scott made a hopeful guess at Fisher 's meaning . " It 's okay if I go to him ? " " Bleek ! " He could n't pick up anything like sense from Fisher , but the emotional response was unmistakable . He hurried toward the picket wood trunk and peered anxiously upward . The strange treecat was shaking where it huddled on the low branch . The dark stains were blood , long since dried , matting the once-beautiful pelt in a leprous patchwork . The treecat was far too thin , looked half starved , in fact . Was it an outcast , that no treecat community would help it ? Did treecats have outcasts ? Whether they did or they did n't , Fisher was certainly urging Scott to help the stranger , so there was no clue to be gleaned from his own treecat 's behavior . " Hello , " Scott said quietly , speaking directly to the treecat above him . " Can I help ? " He projected all the warmth and welcome he could summon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warbling , broken sound , then jumped to the ground and ran straight to Scott , clasping his leg with all four upper limbs and holding on as though life itself depended on the strength of that grip . Fisher swarmed down , touching faces with the stranger and making the soft , crooning sounds Scott recognized from his own occasional bouts of emotional distress . Scott crouched down , offered a hand . The bloodied treecat bumped it with his head , begging for the touch , leading Scott to wonder if this treecat had been around humans before . He stroked the treecat gently , trying to determine from that cautious touch how badly injured it might be . He found no wounds to account for the blood , not even a sign of swelling or inflammation . But the treecat clung to him and shivered and made broken little sounds that horrified Scott nearly as much as they did Fisher , judging by the emotional aura his own treecat was projecting . Something truly dire had happened to this little treecat -- and Scott received a strong premonition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his companion . When Scott tried to pick the treecat up , it let out a frightened sound that prompted Fisher to rest both of his true-hands on the other 's nearest shoulder . A moment later , the filthy , blood-matted treecat swarmed into Scott 's arms , huddling close . Fisher jumped up to his customary perch on Scott 's shoulder , still crooning gently . Irina hesitated some distance away , biting her lower lip uncertainly . Scott nodded her closer with a slight movement of his head and she approached slowly , while Scott stroked the painfully thin treecat reassuringly . When Irina stood beside him , the stray let out a strange , mewling little sound , gazing up at her through grass-green eyes as deep and wounded as a hurt toddler 's . " Poor thing , " she whispered gently , offering a cautious hand . The trembling treecat permitted her touch , arching slightly in Scott 's arms as she stroked gently down its spine . But it was Scott the stray clung to , all four upper limbs clenching in Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , I wonder ? " Scott asked aloud , moving cautiously toward the Zivonik house . " You 're hardly more than fur and bones . You need food and water and God knows what else . " The washboard ribcage under his hands spoke of a prolonged deprivation and he could see cracked , dried skin around the treecat 's mouth , eyes , and delicate hands , indicating dehydration , as well . Scott stroked the distraught treecat gently , whispering softly to it , as he and Irina slowly approached the meter-thick stone walls of the Zivonik house . The most cursory examination told him the treecat was male **26;831;TOOLONG despite the dried blood in its fur . Irina called out , " Alek , the poor thing 's half-starved . Get some meat scraps for him , a dish of cool water , whatever we 've got left from dinner last night ! " " Karl , drag out that leftover turkey , " Aleksandr said , shooing the children inside . " No , Larisa , you can look later , after the treecat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . Stasya , get some water for the treecat . Gregor , run some hot , soapy water and bring out a handful of clean towels . " " Yes , Papa . " Children scattered . " Kitchen 's this way , " Alek escorted him into the house . Scott moved cautiously inside with his unexpected patient , Irina trailing anxiously at his shoulder , and entered a brightly lit kitchen just in time to see Karl , their oldest son , setting out a platter with an enormous , half-stripped turkey carcass . The boy set it down on a broad wooden dining table built to accommodate a growing family . " Dig in , " the boy addressed the bedraggled treecat shyly , cheeks flushed from excitement . " Help yourself . " Stasya , the Zivoniks ' middle daughter , was carrying a basin of water to the table , eyes round with wonder as Scott set the thin treecat down . It paused for only a moment , as though making certain the offer were genuine , then tore into the carcass with ravenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wondrous creature on their kitchen table ; very few humans had actually seen one in person . Even stolid , broad-shouldered Aleksandr Zivonik hunkered down to watch the starving treecat tear into the carcass with surprisingly dainty hands , visibly entranced by the sight of his diminutive sentient guest . Scott smiled gently . " Fisher , " he said , reaching up to stroke his friend , " I have to go back and help deliver that baby now . Can you stay with him ? " Scott had no idea how much his treecat actually understood of what he said , but he and Fisher generally had little trouble communicating basic things . Fisher simply swarmed down his arm and jumped to the table , crooning softly to the battered treecat , which was busily stuffing strips and hunks of turkey into emaciated jaws . Scott hauled his dirt-streaked shirt off , smiling gratefully at Irina when she carried it toward the laundry room , then scrubbed his arms with hot , soapy water and disinfectant at the kitchen sink and hurried back to check on Mrs. Zivonik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest of the Zivonik daughters said at once . " How 's the treecat ? " she added anxiously , edging toward the hallway . " Eating your turkey dinner . Go on , see for yourself . " The girl darted for the door . Scott found his patient nearly as apprehensive as her daughter when Evelina gazed up at him . " It was n't injured ? " she asked anxiously . Clearly , Mrs. Zivonik was as worried over the sudden appearance of an ailing treecat on their doorstep as her husband . So little was known about treecats , the abrupt appearance of a healthy one was often enough to upset the most steady of settlers ; a starvation-thin one with blood in its fur was genuinely cause for fright -- and Evelina Zivonik was n't the only one afraid of the reasons for that treecat 's condition . Scott was considerably disturbed , himself , despite nearly a full T-year of daily contact with a treecat to accustom him to their sometimes startling habits and behaviors . And the last thing Evelina Zivonik needed during a breech-presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried to reassure her as he resumed his interrupted work with the baby . " No , I did n't find any actual injuries . Of course , I ca n't hazard a guess when he last had a solid meal and anything to drink , but he 's wolfing down turkey as fast as he can tear it off the bones , so there 's nothing wrong with his appetite . " " Nadia said it 's covered with dried blood ? " Worry still knotted her brow into a deep furrow . " Yes , but none of its own . Whatever 's happened , we ca n't communicate with treecats very effectively , so I doubt we 'll ever know where the blood came from . The important thing , " and he gave her a firm , reassuring smile , " is that your little neighbor is doing just fine , so there 's no sense in worrying about it . So I want you to relax for me and let 's see if we ca n't get this baby of yours born , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , then dug her fingers into the bedding and groaned as a contraction rippled across her distended belly . Scott reached once again for the recalcitrant infant attempting to get himself born feetfirst and scowled in concentration , moving by feel and instinct . After several minutes of awkward squirming , during which Evelina grunted sharply only a few times -- a stoic woman , Evelina Zivonik -- Scott 's effort and sweat finally paid off . " Ahhah ! Gotcha ! " Scott grinned as the baby under his groping hand finally cooperated enough to turn around inside his mother 's uterus . " Head down and rarin ' to go . Okay , Evelina Zivonik , let 's see if we ca n't get this latest son of yours born ! " Humanity had discovered the existence of the Sphinxian treecats only fifteen Terran months previously , when eleven-year-old Stephanie Harrington had caught one raiding her parents ' greenhouse -- with several bunches of purloined celery strapped to its back in a neatly woven net . No one knew why treecats were so hyped on celery , but ever since that first , fateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to speak , all over Sphinx , importuning their new friends for all the spare , stringy stalks humanity 's kitchen gardens could grow . The sheer number of treecats who had abruptly come calling suggested a far-flung and quite sophisticated communications system of unknown origin , all the more remarkable because the treecats had succeeded in hiding from a high-tech civilization for fully half a Terran century . Enter one eleven-year-old genius with a camera and a battered , shattered glider , and fifty years of secretive observation from the treetops had ended with treecats exploding onto the scene , seeking out human companions in the same way little Stephanie Harrington 's crippled treecat had come to her rescue , leaving its own kind to live with her family . While the adoption rates were not very high compared to the overall human population -- perhaps one in only a million or so -- compared to fifty T-years of total secrecy , during which humanity had n't even suspected the treecats ' existence , the sudden switch in tactics on the part of the treecats was startling . Clearly , the treecats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treecats -- yet humanity still knew almost nothing about their newest neighbors . Not even their level of intelligence could be accurately determined , although Scott had begun forming his own ideas along those lines . Thanks to his somewhat bizarre genetic legacy -- one he 'd sooner have been slow-roasted over coals than reveal to anyone , let alone the xenologists here to study the treecats -- Scott was somehow " tuned in " to the emotions of a sentient alien , one that was , he was beginning to suspect , a whole lot smarter than any human on Sphinx had begun to guess . He also suspected that eleven-year-old Stephanie Harrington was n't telling the full truth about her treecat , either , not if Scott 's experiences with Fisher were any indication . And he was beginning to suspect he knew the reason for her silence . One of the most intense feelings close association with a treecat engendered was an overwhelming protectiveness , an almost subliminal sense that whatever an adoptee learned about his or her treecat , it should under no circumstances be made public knowledge too quickly . Treecats clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of so many other indigenous , low-tech , aboriginal populations throughout human history . Caution and secrecy seemed the better part of wisdom until more could be determined about the simple basics of treecat biology , sociology , and culture . Not to mention how humanity was going to react in the short-term , never mind the long-run . And that was a difficult job , even for an adoptee . Even one like Scott , who had the somewhat unexpected advantage of his ancestors ' irritating tendency toward " second sight " flashes of empathy or whatever it was that Scott experienced on a daily basis with Fisher . That the treecats possessed some level of telepathy or empathy was obvious from the reports made by any " adopted " human . But no instruments existed to measure a thing like telepathy , much less an empathic trait . Understandably , the xenologists were massively frustrated . At the moment , so was Scott MacDallan . The " stray , " as the Zivonik children had christened the emaciated treecat , had filled his cadaverous little belly and promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Lev Zivonik , the stray had graciously suffered Scott to plunk him into hot , soapy water to remove the caked blood and dirt . But he -- for the stray was definitely male -- would not let go of Scott afterward , no matter what enticements were offered . He simply held onto Scott 's shirt , which Irina had thoughtfully laundered for him while little Lev was getting himself born , and shivered . And Fisher displayed an urgent desire for Scott to go outside . Scott suspected that Fisher was relaying what the stray was feeling ; or perhaps Scott was also picking up a sense of urgency from the thin treecat clinging to him , but what he could n't fathom was why the treecats wanted so earnestly for him to hike into a picket wood wilderness after a long , intensive delivery that had left him tired enough to want to go directly home and collapse for the evening . Each time he quietly suggested they might go back to town and return later , however , Fisher grew nearly frantic and the strange treecat emitted choked , mewling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a killer dog . Scott swallowed hard and tried to sound a reasonable note . " But Fisher , it 'll be dark in a couple of hours and I really need to get some sleep . I do n't want to fly after dark , not as tired as I am . " " Bleek ... " Aleksandr asked , " Can you get a sense of how far away they want you to go ? " Scott shook his head . " I ca n't get that kind of detail . Nobody can . All anyone can really pick up is a sort of subliminal sense of intelligent feeling , " he lied through his teeth , aware of Irina 's sharp glance . " Well , occasionally , sign language and pantomime can convey a pretty clear meaning , but it 's maddening , trying to communicate with a sentient that ca n't speak your language , knowing you ca n't possibly learn how to speak its language , either . " He considered the problem for a moment . At length , he suggested , " Fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildering flash of confused emotions , closed his eyes to try sorting them out . Anxiety , sharp fear , rage ... Scott blinked , stared at his friend . Rage ? Fisher huddled on the table in front of him , looking forlorn and solemn . " I 'm not sure why , " he said slowly , " but I do n't think the treecats want me to use the air car . They 're afraid of it . Not Fisher , I mean , he 's flown with me dozens of times , but if I 'm reading Fisher 's reaction right -- and that 's a big if , I 'll grant you that much -- I 'd say the stray 's scared witless of the idea . " Alek lifted one shaggy brow . " Really ? Well , we could set out on foot now and if we have n't found anything in an hour , we could turn around and come back , put you up in the boys ' room and get a good night 's sleep , then start out again tomorrow . " " Bleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they approve . " Irina smiled . Alek added , " I 've got a spare rifle . It 's not likely we 'll run into a hexapuma , and peak bears do n't generally come down this low in a valley , but I do n't go hiking without a good rifle in my hand . " Scott glanced up . " No , I do n't blame you . I 've seen what hexapumas and peak bears can do to a man inadequately armed . I 've got a rifle of my own in the air car , though , thanks . " He scraped back his chair , offered his shoulder to Fisher , who jumped lightly to his accustomed perch . " Let me just get it . " The stray would n't go near Scott 's air car . Scott retrieved his gear , casting uneasy glances at the emaciated treecat who sat in the nearest tree , bleeking in terrible distress , and wondered why the treecat reacted so violently to air cars . Surely nobody would have harassed a treecat colony from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elysian Rule and the fiercely hunger and thirst ? Where had all that blood come from ? And why was the treecat so afraid of air cars ? For that matter , he 'd clearly been wary of humans in general until Fisher had showed up with Scott in tow , refusing to come anywhere near any of the Zivonik family . Why would a treecat be afraid of people , yet broadcast its presence so vocally -- and when a human turned up in treecat company , cling to that person like a leech and insist they go with him into trackless wilderness ? Despite the overwhelmingly positive reaction of the Sphinxian human population to their arboreal neighbors , Scott could think of several unpleasant reasons why a treecat might be afraid of any number of people , given the history of human race relations , even amongst its own species . While the colonists were , on the whole , good people , there were always troublesome , unpleasant individuals in any population and there had been occasional grumbles about sectioning off large parcels of previously choice real estate as sacrosanct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott as they hiked deeper into the forest inspired any confidence that this trek would have a happy outcome . So he gripped his rifle , watched and listened for any sign of hexapumas or peak bears , and tracked the passage of time as the sun lowered gradually toward the treeline . By the time the one-hour limit expired , Scott was flagging behind Aleksandr , an increasingly footsore hiker -- he was n't wearing his hiking boots and civilian shoes were n't manufactured with Sphinxian picket wood systems in mind -- and was more than ready to turn back . As his watch alarm sounded , he called a weary halt and shut it off . " That 's an hour , " he said , unnecessarily . The treecats burst into a frenzy of bleeking , racing along the horizontal picket wood branches overhead to dance agitatedly just above them , then turning and racing back in the direction they 'd been moving steadily for a full hour , now . The urgency he was picking up from Fisher increased at least threefold . He also received the distinct feeling that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted them to see . " Five minutes , " he agreed reluctantly . " Five minutes , then we turn back . " " Bleek ! Bleek , bleek , bleek ! " Fifteen-year-old Karl Zivonik grinned . " Five minutes , huh ? Just how hard is it to say no ' to a treecat , Dr. MacDallan ? " " Watch yourself , youngster , " Scotty smiled , " or one of these days some pretty little lady treecat might decide you 're exactly what she 's looking for -- and then you 'll find out ! " The boy 's eyes went round . " Really ? Do you think I might ever get adopted ? " Scott chuckled , then slapped the youngster 's shoulder . " Frankly , I have no idea . The treecats ca n't share their criteria for picking friends , after all , since they ca n't talk to us . " " Have any girl ' cats adopted anyone ? " Scott frowned slowly . " That 's an interesting question , Karl . Come to think of it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check it out . Maybe the xenology team that arrived to study them will know .
