2007 <p> It was odd how quickly nature reclaimed the land . Emily stepped out of the car and headed into the grass . Where the house used to be , there was only meadow now  --  her family 's own piece of rolling Berkshire hills . <p> Ahead , the trees stretched black and bare against the sky . Though it was the end of October , she 'd hoped to catch at least a few scarlet maple leaves and pick the last apples of the season . She glanced at Clay , wandering aimlessly with his hands in his coat pockets . There was something about the way he looked , angled against the wind in his wool jacket , that reminded her of an old Bob Dylan album her dad used to have . Dylan if he were half-Korean and had come to New York for a finance job instead of rock and roll . Her hair blowing across her face , she started toward him , then stopped as her eyes fell on a rusted metal rod sticking up out of a block of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly mapping out the first floor : were the walls still standing , she 'd be in the kitchen right now . She could see the whole room in her head  --  the big wooden table , the fireplace , the old fridge  --  could practically even see her brother , Thomas , slicing mushrooms at the counter . What would he think of that guy over there ? She saw herself leading Clay into the room . Hey , her brother would say , wiping his hands on his pants before reaching out to shake , really great to meet you . Thomas would set Clay at ease immediately , and before she knew it the two of them , her brother and her boyfriend , would be cooking together , experimenting and laughing at the stove . At some point , her mother would come in all aflutter , carrying a basket of herbs and flowers from the garden . My God ! When did you get here ? I never heard you pull in  --  trying to mask her surprise as she registered Clay 's Asian American features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't bother him just yet . <p> According to the laws of science , neither mass nor energy is created or destroyed ; the total amount in the universe always remains constant . And fundamentally , Emily understood this . But , as she moved through the knee-high grass , which used to be the kitchen and used to be animated by four lives  --  one of which was no longer being lived  --  she could not fathom where it had all gone . Was the energy still there ? And what of Thomas ? How did the laws of conservation apply to him ? <p> <p> Following the pattern of cement blocks , she circled the periphery of the house , mentally rebuilding and refurnishing each room . There was the bathroom with the pedestal sink , where she 'd fallen and chipped a tooth while she and Thomas were horsing around ; her bedroom where she retreated to write poetry and listen to music , but mostly to get away from her mother ; and the living room with the couch in front of the fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house did n't have the feeling of something that had happened to her personally . It felt instead like an epic or a myth . And it was mythic , really , the way her father had destroyed everything : his house , his family , and of course most tragically , his son . In retrospect , it all seemed inevitable , as if fate had destined things to be so and had never offered the possibility of them happening any other way . <p> " So , I guess we 'll put the reception tent here . Right ? " Clay was standing several yards away , sweeping his arm to include the relatively flat area where they were both standing . <p> She looked at him blankly . There was something incongruous about the sight of him on this property . He did n't seem to belong here , and that concerned her . <p> " Em ? " <p> " Sure . That makes sense . " <p> He watched her for a moment before coming over . " What 's up ? Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . " She gazed up the road and shivered . <p> He wrapped his arms around her , rubbing his hands up and down her back to generate warmth . She looked into his face . She loved that face , she knew she did  --  the soft curves of the nose and chin , those beautiful eyes rimmed with thick black lashes . This is an amazing person , she told herself , a unique and amazing person . <p> They 'd come here the first time a few years ago , after they 'd been together about a year . She 'd brought other boyfriends before Clay , and something about being on this property with them had forced her to stop lying to herself about them . But with Clay , it was the opposite  --  a sure sign that what they had was real . He had n't felt the need to act formal and somber as they walked up the hill and through the woods , nor had he felt a compulsive need to lighten things and make her laugh . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : letting her be without leaving her alone . <p> She watched him walk away and lower himself to the ground . Exactly a week ago , she and Clay had been strolling through Central Park . It was a perfect fall day , crisp and bright , and the entire city was reveling in it . But when the two of them arrived at the Alice in Wonderland sculpture , they found themselves alone . Clay suggested they climb up on the mushroom as they often saw children do , and laughing , she agreed . As she began to pull herself up , however , she noticed that he hung behind , jangling his keys in his pocket . <p> " Do n't worry , " she told him , " nobody 's going to see you . " <p> He looked at her with a funny smile . " I 'm not afraid of looking dumb . It was my idea in the first place . " <p> Once they were both up there , lying back on the bronze surface , they stripped off their jackets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he took her hand and slipped a delicate pearl ring onto her finger . He watched her face with anticipation . <p> " Emily , will you marry me ? I would kneel , but . . . " Indicating the absurdity of their location , he gave her a quick apologetic smile . <p> " What ? " she said , still stunned . " No way . " <p> " I hope that 's not your answer . " <p> She laughed . " Yes ! " she said , kissing him . " Of course I 'll marry you . Definitely yes . " <p> They had spoken about marriage many times , and for a while now , whenever they spoke of the future , they spoke of their being together as a given . But still , this was a surprise . <p> " Oh my god , " she said , admiring the ring . " How long have you been planning this ? " <p> " I did n't plan to do it here . I 've been carrying the ring around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then this just seemed better somehow . " <p> " It 's perfect . " <p> " If the ring is n't right , there are lots of others . I talked to the woman at the store  --  " <p> " Clay , stop , " she said , grabbing his hand . " I love it . Really . " She gazed up at the clouds moving slowly across the sky , thick and lumpy in their centers , thinning out and breaking up around the edges like flour sifted onto a blue counter . Right then , out of the corner of her eye , she saw something flapping  --  a plastic deli sack caught on a bush , thank you printed over and over in red down its wind-crinkled side . <p> Even now as she thought back on it , the ugliness of that sack dominated her memory of the day . She looked over at Clay , partially hidden among the weeds , contentedly fiddling with a piece of straw . Why had they talked so much about the ring ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous . But why ? <p> Car wheels scraped on gravel , and Clay stood up as the silver Mercedes pulled in next to their Honda . Her mother and Earl eventually got out of the car and made their way toward them . Earl , in a tweed cap , looked ready for a grouse shoot on the Scottish moors . Laura was carrying a shopping bag , which Earl took from her as they leaned on each other and carefully picked a path over the ever so slightly graded ground . <p> " Sorry we 're late , " Laura said , girlish as always with her unstyled hair and baggy sweater . She hugged Emily and then Clay . <p> " How was the drive ? " he asked . <p> " Oh . " Earl stopped for a moment , panting a bit . " It was all right . " He hugged them both , surveying the property through squinted eyes . " Nice to be here , though . " <p> " Mom , you might want a coat . " <p> " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty cold . Look . " Emily made a hushed ho sound , and a cloud of white vapor drifted out of her mouth . <p> " Boy , look at that , " Earl said . <p> " I always forget how much cooler it is up here . " Laura took the bag from him and handed it to Emily . " I got you this in Paris . A little engagement present . " <p> " Thanks , " Emily said , taking the bag . " That 's so sweet . " <p> " It 's a little something I found for you at a lingerie store . I could n't resist . " <p> " Ooh . " She raised her eyebrows at Clay . " Luck y you . " <p> " Yeah . " He laughed . " A present for me , I guess . " <p> " I also have a bottle of Late for you at home . " <p> " Mom . . . " <p> Laura gave a coy shrug . " Well , you ca n't drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't drink at all . " <p> " Come on . Do n't you think it 's fun to have a bottle of wine that was released the same month you got engaged ? " <p> Emily looked at Clay , incredulous . There was an awkward pause . <p> " We were thinking we could put the reception tent over here , " Clay said , motioning toward the area behind them . <p> Laura nodded . " Seems like a good place for it . " <p> They all grew silent and business-like as they focused on the area . <p> " Have you decided where you want to do the ceremony ? " Laura asked . <p> Clay shook his head . " Not yet . " <p> " I know where we 're going to do the ceremony , " Emily told them . <p> Clay gave her an inquisitive look . They all waited in vain for her to take the next step . <p> " Do you want to show us ? " he asked . " Or are we supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , starting out across the grass . The strawlike strands grew taller and thicker as they moved up the hill so that her shins were eventually plowing through waves of vegetation , the shopping bag making a swishing sound as it skimmed along the top . <p> Halfway up the hill , the land leveled off as if to serve the cluster of apple trees that dominated the even plane . She stopped in the center of the orchard and turned to wait for the others . Clay was patiently making his way up the hill in a pair of slippery-soled loafers . Her mother and Earl followed slowly , her mother 's hand grasping onto his elbow . <p> In the far distance , a few developments had sprung up over the years , but for the most part , everything within twenty miles remained unspoiled . Her parents had been lucky  --  they had n't realized how lucky at the time  --  to find a property that was virtually surrounded by state-owned nature reserves , protected from the encroachment of real estate developers and urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't believe I did n't think of this . Of course it 's the perfect spot . " As he arrived beside her , he added , " for so many reasons . " <p> She took his hand . " I 'm glad you think so . " <p> Her mother sighed , suddenly looking much more tired than the climb justified . " You want to get married here ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Well . . . " She put her hands on her hips and gazed off into the distance . " How do you think you 're going to fit all those chairs up here ? " <p> " I was thinking people could stand . " <p> " Stand ? " She said this as if there had never been an occasion on which people had stood for a good thirty minutes beneath these very trees . <p> " Yeah . " <p> Her mom was looking everywhere but at her . After a while , she gave a tight , forced smile , and Emily could see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mom , " she said , putting her arm around her . " It 's not a sad thing . " <p> " Yes , it is , " her mother shot back . " It 's a very sad thing . " <p> Emily dropped her arm . " What I meant was . . . I wish you would n't see it as a sad thing to be having the ceremony here . I like the idea that he 'll be here for it . You know ? " <p> Her mother 's lips began to tremble , and she brought a fist to her mouth . <p> Emily put her arm around her again . <p> Clay cast a glance at Earl , then said , " Maybe the two of you would like a few minutes up here alone . " <p> Emily nodded . <p> As the men started to walk away , her mother pulled herself together . " We wo n't be long , " she called after them . <p> She gave Emily 's hand a couple of friendly pats to signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you told your father ? " <p> It took a moment to adjust to this new line of conversation . " Um . . . No . I mean I have n't had the chance to speak to him yet . " She did n't feel like mentioning the appointment tomorrow in Dr. Shepherd 's office . If all went well , she 'd probably tell him there . <p> " Oh , " her mom said , reaching over to a nearby branch and twisting at the stem of a lone brown apple until it released into her palm . She examined it and then tossed it down the hill . <p> They both watched it roll and hop and roll again until it eventually disappeared into a tall mound of grass . <p> " How was Scotland ? " Emily asked . <p> " You know . . . It was okay . Of course , shooting is n't really my thing . But it was very pretty , and Paris was fun . " <p> Emily nodded , and they stood there quietly for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrooms ? " Laura asked . <p> Emily 's face fell . " I had n't thought about that . " <p> " I still do n't see why you refuse to get married in the city . " <p> " I want to do it here . " <p> Laura rubbed her hands up and down her arms . " I should have worn a coat . Are you ready to go back ? " <p> " You go ahead . I 'm going to stay a little longer . " <p> Her mother peered at her apprehensively . " I hope you 're not upset with me . " <p> " No . Not at all . " <p> " I was only trying to be realistic about the problems you 're facing here . " <p> " I know . " <p> " Do n't worry . We 'll make it work . " <p> She smiled to let her mom know she appreciated the sentiment . Then , as Laura started down the hill , treading carefully on the path the four of them had cleared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the bare apple branches at the sky . There was no symphony of insects , no rustle of leaves  --  just the sound of the wind blowing cold upon the wood and stroking the tops of the grass , a white noise interrupted by nothing but the occasional squawk of a crow . <br> One clenched , brown fist of fruit hung directly overhead . The wind moved the twigs around it . The branch itself even swayed a little . But the apple did not budge . It held strong and willfully still . She thought of how her brother had become a part of these trees , every rainfall and every snowmelt encouraging his ashes to be drunk up by the trees ' roots , climbing from there high into the trunk and out through each limb to the buds , flowers , fruits , and leaves . <p> She wished that her brother would descend from the branches and come and sit beside her for a few minutes . He had always been the one to provide her with a sense of perspective , to let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gently back toward her own version of equilibrium . She had never been able , and would never be able , to achieve that extraordinary level of balance which , for Thomas , was simply status quo . <p> Lying back on the grass , she closed her eyes . In the blackness , she could feel her brother stretched out beside her , propped up on an elbow , his head resting in his hand . It was as if they were lounging on a picnic blanket as they had done so many times over the years no matter whether it was sunny and warm or drizzling and cold . <p> I think you 'd like Clay . <p> Even Mom likes him , miracle of miracles  --  crazy about him , in fact . <p> She imagined Thomas listening as he had always done , waiting until she 'd said everything she needed to say before giving any sort of response . He remained still , expecting her to proceed . <p> He 's such a good person . Really nice , solid . . . <p> Goddammit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture from her cheek , she shut her eyes more tightly . She wanted to keep talking so that the conversation would not end , but she could n't think of anything else to say . The only response she got was from a crow way off in the distance . She lay there for a little while longer , trying to hold on to the image of Thomas lying beside her . But he was back up in the trees , out of reach . <p> <p> Excerpted from The Embers by Hyatt Bass <br> Copyright 2009 by HYATT BASS <br> Published in 2009 by Henry Holt and Company
