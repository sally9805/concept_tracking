Master of the House In the wine-country outpost of Yountville , California , oenophiles are lingering for longer than usual at Ma(i)sonry Napa Valley , the newest enterprise of banker turned vintner Michael Polenske , of Blackbird Vineyards fame . Inside his gallery-cum-wineshop , in a 105-year-old , meticulously renovated stone-and-mortar building , Polenske has curated a collection of antiques , art , limited-edition furniture and rare wines , which are on hand for tasting and purchase . Accented with original , unmilled timbers and a steel-mesh staircase , the two-level salon evokes a private home appointed with objets from here and abroad .

SUZANNE GANNON A CATALOGUE COME TO LIFE Just down the road from Ma(i)-sonry and tucked behind Yountville 's historic V Marketplace is the new NapaStyle , in a soaring space formerly occupied by stables .
