Chapter One I still live in Atlanta . All of us do-Mama , Hermione , and me . Mama still lives on Willow Street , in the house we moved to after losing the split-level on Bunnybrooke Drive . She stays there out of spite , I think . This way no one can forget the cruelty that life has done her . Hermione and her family live in a suburb called Lawrenceville , halfway to Athens , which is as far away as you can get without actually leaving town . I can picture my sister leaving us for good , moving to France , doing a Josephine Baker , wearing a dress made of fruit . She can likely envision such scenarios for herself as well . But she stays here in Georgia because of her husband , Mr. Phinazee , who is far too old to learn any new tricks . I make my home in the West End . Little plaques affixed to the street signs insist that it is " The Historic West End , " a designation secured by real estate interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this area was on the rise . They point to Grant Park , which has become a Victorian oasis , smack in the center of town . It 's only a matter of time , they say , urging yuppies and buppies alike , until gentrification elevates the West End , the historic West End , too . I hope they are right . I only rent my house , so I have no real financial stake in the prospect , but Ilike the idea of imminent transformation and appreciation . The West End is a hard place to wrap your mind around . My house is off People Street , not too far from the Wren 's Nest-where , depending on your take on things , Joel Chandler Harris either wrote or plagiarized the Uncle Remus stories . Just over a mile away is Spelman College , my alma mater , built where there were once Civil War barracks . And across the street from Spelman are some of the meanest housing projects in the South . I guess the only really consistent variable in the West End is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bourgie girls I went to college with , all of whom seemed to be doctors ' daughters or professors ' kids , to my neighbors , cracked out and depressed , everybody is black . My landlord , crooked and mean , is every bit as black as the people who run the homeless shelter on the corner of Landrum and Cascade . Lately white folks are moving into our neighborhood , one by one . I 'm not bent out of shape about it . A gay couple , Jewish , according to my roommate , Rochelle , bought the pale yellow bungalow across the road , which has recently been restored to its turn-of-the-century splendor-wraparound porch and stained-glass panels in the mahogany door . Rochelle and I considered taking them a gift to welcome them to the neighborhood . She suggested baking cookies , but then we worried that they might not trust us enough to eat what we had prepared . The very idea of this offended us as though we had actually offered them the cookies and they 'd refused . So we never introduced ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quiet as it 's kept , the house where Rochelle and I live is identical to the showplace across the street . Ours is a fixer-upper that has n't been fixed up yet . The paint flakes like green dandruff ; underneath , the wood is dotted with termite tunnels . Inside , however , is much nicer . The wood floors might be paint-flecked and scarred , but you can still tell that it is good pine . In my bedroom there is a great old fireplace , but the mantels were stolen decades ago , when all the houses in the West End stood empty and abandoned . Still , the mantels can be replaced along with the crystal doorknobs and brass window cranks . Last March , crackheads stole two potted ficus trees and a wrought-iron mailbox from the house across the street . The three of us-me , Rochelle , and my boyfriend , Dwayne-watched from my front porch . The porch is one of the best places in our house , despite the fact that it is not screened in . Our landlord let us keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were two pieces , a love seat that could seat two people comfortably and three in a pinch and a high-backed throne that Rochelle called the Huey Newton Seat . At night we left the love seat on the porch , figuring that it was too bulky for crackheads to steal ; but the Huey Newton Seat was stored in the living room when it was n't in use . " It 's a cultural antique , " Rochelle insisted . I told her that most people did n't even remember who Huey Newton was , but she said that they would steal the chair anyway . It was like stealing a rare coin not because it 's rare , but because it 's a coin . It was a pain to haul the chair in at night-it was over five feet tall and the wicker was brittle with age . But Rochelle does what she wants . Winter had just ended when my neighbor Cynthia and her cousin stole the Jewish guys ' mailbox and ficus trees . Dwayne and I had sat close and cozy on the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was cool , but the sun warmed our foreheads . It was the sort of afternoon that is hot and cold at the same time , letting us know that spring was ahead of us , but not quite allowing us to forget the winter behind . Rochelle and Dwayne had laughed as Cynthia , who lived three doors down , and her cousin dragged the dainty trees and their glazed pots down the repaved driveway . Dwayne said , " Remember the Alamo , " and this made us laugh . The mailbox was harder to steal . Together they tugged at the white post until it gave way , like a stubborn hunk of crabgrass . We laughed some more , now rooting against the taming and gentrification of our neighborhood . We delighted in the hardheaded nature of poverty , of a block that did n't welcome change . We drank to Cynthia and her cousin , clicking the rims of plastic tumblers of lemonade , vodka , and ice . So I 'm not sure why I was stunned when I came home one May afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead bolt on my front door , the door itself hanging open just a bit , the way you do when you know company is coming and you do n't want them to bother to knock . Why did I stagger backward , a step or two from the opening , frightened and disbelieving at the same time , my eyes scanning the quiet road for a face that could explain things to me , straighten this whole thing out ? Of course I knew that this was n't the safest of neighborhoods . My mother , who lives less than ten miles away but never visits , sends me news clippings snipped from the back pages of the Journal-Constitution , little news articles about rapes , murders , and drug busts in the West End . She keeps me informed so I will always be aware of how safe I am not . It was n't that I doubted the accuracy of the articles . Lying in bed , I often heard gunshots as distant as thunder and close as lightning . But I did n't imagine that someone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle through my belongings , taking what they wanted , leaving the rest . This was n't supposed to happen to Rochelle and me . We often joked that no one bothered us because everyone knew what we did for a living : nonprofit work at the Literacy Action and Resource Center . Even crackheads knew that there was no money in nonprofit . We 'd borrowed this quip from Lawrence , our boss , who used the same rationale to explain why the Literacy Center-three miles away in Vine City-had never been vandalized , burglarized , or otherwise defaced . This , despite the fact that four homes on the block were boarded up , housing drug addicts and other vagrants . We really did believe that we were exempt from the crime in the area due to our vocation . Not because of our low wages , but because our neighbors understood that we were here trying to do something good . We taught people to read . Was n't that something that just about anyone could see was an honorable and decent way to spend one 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn down to nickel from so many hands , too many twists . Then I curled my fingers back . What if someone was still inside ? I tripped down the three crumbling stairs , dislodging clumps of old cement , and took a few steps to the jagged sidewalk . Where was the nearest pay phone ? On the corner was a stump where a phone used to be . Across the street the Jewish men had installed a black iron fence with curlicues and other flourishes that kept people off their property . Along the border were knee-high hedges which , over time , would grow as high as the fence . It made sense to knock on their door , ask to use their phone , but somehow I did n't want to admit to them what had happened . Summer had come early this year . It was only the middle of May , but temperatures were in the high eighties and , if the weatherman could be believed , the humidity was seventy-four percent . My neighbor Cynthia sort of materialized in the thick air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strap diagonal across her flat chest . " What 's wrong with you ? " Cynthia wanted to know when she reached me . " Somebody broke in . " I worked to keep the whine out of my voice . No matter what had been going on inside my house , I knew that Cynthia had likely seen a lot worse . She was thin in the way that all crackheads are when they have been doing it a long time . Her forehead , blooming with white-topped acne , managed to be oily and ashen at the same time . " You went in yet to see what all is missing ? You called the police ? " " I did n't want to go in . What if somebody is still in there ? " Cynthia said , " Do n't worry . They been gone . " " You saw them ? " She nodded . " It was two men . " " What did they look like ? " " Sort of regular , " she said . I scanned her face to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I to know what the truth looked like ? My eyes kept drifting up from her yellowish eyes to her hair . It was straightened , held in place by hair gel that dried in great white flakes . But just over her ear , where Billie Holiday had pinned her gardenia , was a silver clip studded with pink and white rhinestones . " That 's pretty , " I said . " Your barrette . " " You want it ? " she said , pulling it free . I stared at it lying across the dark creases of her hand . Up close it was n't so nice . Many of the stones were missing , leaving dead rusty sockets . " I 'll give it to you , " said Cynthia . " For two dollars . " I patted my pockets . " I just have one dollar . " " That will work , " she said . " You can give me the other one next time I see you . " I held the dollar out to her , but she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her vibrating palm . I plucked it from her hand . She , in her fast , noiseless way , covered my other hand in hers , almost caressing it before she slid the dollar bill from between my fingers . " That 's a real nice hair bow , " she said . " Do n't forget about the rest of my money . " She raised her eyebrows and gave me a sympathy smile , just turning up the corners of her mouth without showing teeth . I looked back at my house , the front door still slightly ajar . From where I stood I could see that our two umbrellas were still stashed in the wire basket by the door . I slipped the heavy barrette into the pocket of my skirt and moved in the direction that Cynthia had gone . When I found a pay phone , I 'd call Rochelle and tell her to come home . I 'd call the police so they could write up a report . Then I 'd call Dwayne and ask him to make things safe again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel . She 'd been at work , bringing all the files up to date . She swung into the driveway , causing the gravel to jump like popcorn . She hopped out of the car and trotted to where I sat on the curb . I almost gasped at the sight of her . Rochelle and I had been roommates for three years and we 'd known each other since we were both eighteen . You 'd think I 'd be immune to her odd beauty , but her fantastic coloring-hair gone so gray that it was almost magnolia cream white and her deep brown skin-this was the sort of thing that you kept noticing over and over . My boyfriend , Dwayne , says Rochelle would be pretty if she were n't so weird-looking , but I think that she would n't be so pretty were she not so unusual . " It was n't Cynthia , " I said . " No , " Rochelle said , settling beside me on the hot curb . " Cynthia would n't break into our house . " " They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know your neighbors . People do n't rob people they know . " Rochelle nodded , but we were both just parroting what we 'd read in pamphlets about urban renewal . This was the kind of thing that we told our parents . My mother had said , " Even if you form a relationship with the people on your street and they decide not to rape and murder you , what about the people on the next block over ? They would slit your throat over a cup of purple Kool-Aid . " " We ca n't tell our parents , " I said . " Depends on what 's missing , " Rochelle said . " Depending on what 's missing , we might have to tell them anyway . " She was thinking of all the things she 'd already bought in preparation for her wedding , namely her wedding dress-a voluminous crepe lisse affair , lush with gold thread and lace-which cost about as much as a decent used car . There were other items , the Baccarat bud vases and the china place settings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months away . " They would n't take the dress . Burglars do n't steal clothes . They want electronics . " " Aria , " Rochelle said , " we saw Cynthia and her cousin steal a goddamned mailbox . " " I know , " I said , hoping to soothe her . " That was different . And anyway , Cynthia did n't have anything to do with this . " " Did you call the police ? " " Yeah . " " Nine one one ? " " Yeah . " " You know what Public Enemy said ? " Rochelle asked with a smile . " Nine one one is a joke ? " " No , " Rochelle said . " Crack killed applejack . " " That was n't Public Enemy . " " Well , whoever said it . That was way back when we were in high school . Do you think it 's getting any better ? " " I hope so , " I said . The police came next . One guy in a blue and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we were while he made sure there was no one inside the house . I told him that Cynthia had seen two men leave . He wanted to know why Cynthia had n't called the police . " A neighborhood watch is supposed to do more than watch , " he said . I shrugged , thinking of the afternoon that Rochelle , Dwayne , and I had just watched what happened to the home across the street . It took less than ten minutes for the policeman to determine that the house was vacant . " Is it in real bad shape ? " Rochelle wanted to know . " Is that your real hair color ? " he said , reaching out to touch one of her silver dreadlocks . Rochelle recoiled just slightly . I knew she did n't like it when strangers felt licensed to touch her just because of her difference . The officer paused , but squeezed a hank of her hair between his fingers anyway . " My hair 's been gray since I was a teenager , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about the house ? " I asked him . " It looked okay to me , " he said . " Of course you are going to have to do a thorough look-see to know if anything is missing . But as far as I can tell , things seem undisturbed . " A voice squawked out of his receiver , reminding me of the day of the accident . There were dogwood trees in our yard , but this time of year they just stood there leafy and benign . We sat with him on the porch while he filled out paperwork . Rochelle signed on various dotted lines . As the policeman handed me the pink copy of the triplicate form , he stopped . " You know who you look like ? " " Yeah , " I said . " I know . " " Penny , from Good Times . You look like Janet Jackson would look if she was a regular person . " " Is that all ? " Rochelle said , holding her hand out for the form . He shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . " You can go through and see what 's missing if you want . But really-your TV and stuff was all in there . Did you have more jewelry ? " He was looking at Rochelle 's engagement ring . It was somewhat smaller than a dime but plenty large enough to sparkle like a disco ball . She put her left hand behind her . " It 's just costume jewelry . " The policeman chuckled . " You can save that lie for the crackheads . " I gave him a careful smile and waited for him to leave . Rochelle and I held hands as we crossed our threshold . The officer had been right . It did n't look like anything was missing . The red , white , and blue Priority Mail boxes containing various wedding implements were still stacked against the living room walls . The small television still rested in the particleboard entertainment set , the VCR still attached . " Do you want to look in your room first , or mine ? " Rochelle said . " Yours , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake here for her than for me . Her room was disorderly , but Rochelle was just that sort of person . I could n't say for sure if some burglar had left the drawers hanging open or if Rochelle herself had dumped the contents of her jewelry box onto her unmade bed . Rochelle regarded the tangle of silver necklaces and gold bracelets without reacting . ( Continues ... )
