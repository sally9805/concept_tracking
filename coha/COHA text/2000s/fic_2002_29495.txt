BRIANNE PARKER did nt look like a bank robber or a murderer her pleasantly plump baby face fooled everyone . But she knew that she was ready to kill if she had to this morning . She would find out for sure at ten minutes past eight . The twenty-four-year-old woman wore khakis , a powder blue University of Maryland windbreaker , and scuffed white Nike sneakers . None of the early-morning commuters noticed her as she walked from her dented white Acura to a thick stand of evergreen trees , where she hid . She was outside the Citibank in Silver Spring , Maryland , just before eight . The branch was scheduled to open in ninety seconds . She knew from her talks with the Mastermind that it was a freestanding bank with two drive-through lanes . It was surrounded by what he called big-box stores : Target , PETsMART , Home Depot , Circuit City . At eight oclock on the dot , Brianne approached the bank from her hiding place in the evergreens under a colorful billboard obnoxiously offering McDonalds breakfast to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female teller who was just opening the glass front door and had momentarily stepped outside . A few strides from the teller , she slipped on a rubbery President Clinton mask , one of the most popular masks in America and probably the one hardest to trace . She knew the bank tellers name , and she spoke it clearly as she pulled out her gun and pressed it against the small of the womans back . " Inside , Ms. Jeanne Galetta . Then turn around and lock the front door again . Were going to see your boss , Mrs. Buccieri . " Her short speech at the entrance to the bank was scripted , word for word , even the pauses . The Mastermind said it was crucial that a bank robbery proceed in a specific order , almost by rote . " I do nt want to kill you , Jeanne . But I will if you do nt do everything I say , when I say it . Its your turn to talk now , darling . Do you understand what Ive just told you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown hair so vigorously that her wire-rimmed glasses nearly fell off . " Yes , I do . Please do nt hurt me , " she gasped . She was in her late twenties , attractive in a suburban sort of way , but her blue polyester pantsuit and sensible stack-heeled shoes made her look older . " The managers office . Now , Ms. Jeanne . If Im not out of here in eight minutes , you will die . Im serious . If Im not out of here in eight minutes , you and Mrs. Buccieri die . Do nt think I wont do it because Im a woman . I will shoot you both like dogs . Chapter Two SHE LIKED THIS AURA OF POWER and she really liked the new respect she was suddenly getting at the bank . As she followed the trembling teller past the two Diebold ATMs and then through the meeter-greeter area of the lobby , Brianne thought about the precious seconds she had already taken . The Mastermind had been explicit about the tight schedule for the robbery . He had repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minutes matter , Brianne . Seconds matter , Brianne . It even matters that it 's Citibank we 've chosen to hit today , Brianne . The robbery had to be exact , precise , perfect . She got it , she got it . The Mastermind had planned it on what he called " a numerical scale of 9.9999 out of 10 . " With the heel of her left hand , Brianne shoved the teller into the manager 's office . She heard the low hum of a computer coming from inside . Then she saw Betsy Buccieri sitting behind her big executive-style desk . " You open up your safe every morning at five past eight , so open it for me , " she screamed at the manager , who was wide-eyed with surprise and fear . " Open it . Now ! " " I ca n't open the vault , " Mrs. Buccieri protested . " The vault is automatically opened by a computer signal from the main office in Manhattan . It never happens at the same time . " The bank robber pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger for Mrs. Betsy Buccieri to listen . To listen to what , though ? " Five , four , three , two - " Brianne said . Then she reached for the phone on the manager 's desk . It rang . Perfect timing . " It 's for you , " Brianne said , her voice slightly muffled by the rubbery President Clinton mask . " You listen carefully . " She handed the phone to Mrs. Buccieri , but she knew the exact words the bank manager would hear , and who the speaker was . The scariest voice of all for the bank manager to hear was not that of the Mastermind making very real but idle-sounding threats , but someone even better . Scarier . " Betsy , it 's Steve . There 's a man here in our house . He has a gun pointed at me . He says that unless the woman in your office leaves the bank with the money by eight-ten exactly , Tommy , Anna , and I will be killed . " It 's eight-oh-four . " The phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . " Steve ? Steve ! " Tears flowed into Betsy Buccieri 's eyes and rolled down her cheeks . She stared at the masked woman and could n't believe this was happening . " Do n't hurt them . Please . I 'll open the vault for you . I 'll do it now . Do n't hurt anyone . " Brianne repeated the message the bank manager had already heard . " Eight-ten exactly . Not one second later . And no stupid bank tricks . No silent alarms . No dye packs . " " Follow me . No alarms , " Betsy Buccieri promised . She almost could n't think . Steve , Tommy , Anna . The names rang loudly in her head . They arrived at the door of the bank 's Mosler vault . It was 8:05 . " Open the door , Betsy . We are on the clock . We 're losing time . Your family is losing time . Steve , Anna , little Tommy , they could all die . " It took a little less than two minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a polished steel thing of beauty with pistons like a locomotive . Stacks of money were plainly visible on nearly all the shelves - more money than Brianne had ever seen in her life . She snapped open two canvas duffel bags and began filling them with the cash . Mrs. Buccieri and Jeanne Galetta watched her take the money in silence . She liked seeing the fear and respect for her on their faces . As she 'd been instructed to , Brianne counted off the minutes as she filled the duffel bags . " Eight-oh-seven . . . eight-oh-eight ... " Finally , she was finished with her part in the vault . " I 'm locking you both inside the vault . Do n't say one word or I 'll shoot you , then lock your dead bodies up . " She hoisted the black duffel bags . " Do n't hurt my husband or my baby , " Betsy Buccieri begged . " We did what you - " Brianne slammed the heavy metal door on Betsy Buccieri 's desperate plea . She yanked her President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . She walked across the lobby , unlocked the front door with plastic-gloved hands , and went outside . She felt like running as fast as she could to her car , but she walked calmly , as if she did n't have a care in the world on this fine spring morning . She was tempted to pull out her six-shooter and put a hole into the big Egg McShit staring down on her . Yeah , she had an attitude , all right . When she got to the Acura , she checked her watch : 52 seconds past 8:10 . And counting . She was late - but that was the way it was supposed to be . She smiled . She did n't call Errol at the Buccieri house where Steve , Tommy , and the nanny , Anna , were being held . She did n't tell him she had the money and she was safely in the Acura . She had been told not to by the Mastermind . The hostages were supposed to die . Chapter Three THERE 'S AN OLD SAYING that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective : Do n't think there are no crocodiles because the water is calm . The water was certainly lovely and calm that day . My young and irrepressible daughter , Jannie , had Rosie the Cat up on her hind legs and she was holding Rosie 's front paws in her hands . She and " la chatte rouge " were dancing , as they often did . " Roses are red , violets are blue , " Jannie sang in a sweet , lilting voice . It was a moment and an image I would n't forget . Friends , relatives , and neighbors had begun to arrive for the christening party at our house on Fifth Street . I was in a hugely celebratory mood . Nana Mama had prepared an amazing meal for the special occasion . There was cilantro-marinated shrimp , roasted mussels , fresh ham , Vidalia onions , and summer squash . The aroma of chicken with garlic , pork ribs , and four kinds of homemade bread filled the air . I 'd even made my specialty that night , my contribution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nana 's refrigerator notes was posted on the door of the GE . It read : " ' There is an incredible amount of magic and feistiness in black men that nobody has been able to wipe out . But everybody has tried . ' - Toni Morrison . " I smiled at the magic and feistiness of my eightysomething-year-old grandmother . This was so good . Jannie , Damon , little Alex , and I were greeting everybody on the front porch as they arrived . Alex was in my arms , and he was a very social little baby . He had happy smiles for everyone , even for my partner , John Sampson , who can scare little kids at first because he 's mammoth - and scary . " The boy obviously likes to party , " Sampson observed , and grinned broadly . Alex grinned right back at Two-John , who is six-nine and about two hundred fifty pounds . Sampson reached out and took the baby from me . Alex nearly disappeared in his hands , which are the size of catcher 's mitts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby in total gibberish . Christine appeared from the kitchen . She joined the three of us . So far , she and Alex Jr . were living apart from us . We hoped they would come join Nana , Damon , Jannie , and me in this house . Just one big family . I wanted Christine as my wife , not just as a girlfriend . I wanted to wake little Alex in the mornings , then put him to sleep at night . " I 'm going to walk around the party with little Alex . Shamelessly use him to pick up pretty women , " Sampson said . He walked off with Alex cradled in his arms . " You think he 'll ever get married ? " Christine asked . " Little Alex ? The Boy ? Sure he will . " " No , your partner in crime , John Sampson . Will he ever get married , settle down ? " It did n't sound like it bothered her that we were n't . " I think he will - someday . John had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John was a year old - eventually died of an overdose . John 's mother was a drug addict . She lived in Southeast until a couple of years ago . Sampson was practically raised by my Aunt Tia , with help from Nana . " We watched Sampson cruise the party with little Alex in his arms . He hit on a pretty lady named De Shawn Hawkins , who worked with Christine . " He really is using the baby to hit on women , " Christine said in amazement . " De Shawn , be careful , " she called to her friend . I laughed . " Says what he 's going to do , does what he says . " The party had started around two in the afternoon . It was still going strong at nine-thirty . I had just sung a duet with Sampson , Joe Tex 's " Skinny Legs and All . " It was a howling success . We got a lot of laughs and playful jeers . Sampson was starting to sing " You 're the First , the Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the FBI arrived . I should have told everybody to go home - the party was all but over .
