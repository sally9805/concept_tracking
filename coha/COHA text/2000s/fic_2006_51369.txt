Bruce McAllister published his first story in 1963 and he made his first appearance in our pages in the April 1968 issue . He is the author of two novels , Humanity Prime and Dream Baby . During the 1990s , we did n't hear much from him , but in recent years he has been very productive , with stories appearing in Asimov 's , Sci Fiction , not to mention " Hero : The Movie " and " The Boy in Zaquitos " in recent issues of ours . He says he 's working on a YA novel . The Dragons of Como . His new one is a disquieting tale of what might have been ( and what may yet still be ) . <p> During those decades we never really knew who was watching . - Admiral William " Billy " Brandicoff , 1918-2000 ONE NIGHT WHEN IWAS TEN , too grown-up to sit between my mother and father in the front seat anymore , my dad put us in the car at our house on San Diego Bay and began to drive through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast scrub-brush emptiness . My father was executive officer of the Navy laboratory high up on the peninsula , where civilian scientists with top-secret clearances did their experiments day and night , though he 'd never taken us there . It was classified and he could n't . But tonight , even if he was n't wearing his uniform , he was taking us somewhere , somewhere that felt secret . He did n't say a thing as we drove . He did n't say , " I 've got a surprise for you two , " or " This is going to be a long drive , but I think it 'll be worth it . " He just drove while my mother told him about what the other wives were doing for the Christmas dinner at the yacht club and how well I was doing in science and social studies , and , well , yes , a little less well in math . I do n't remember whether we passed through a military gate . If we did , it was a simple one , barely there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticker on our car , saluted crisply , clicked his heels , as they all did , and said , " Good evening , Sir . " It was n't heavy security or I 'd remember that . It was just an endless training base somewhere in the northern part of the county where , in the moonlight , my father drove and drove and my mother and I tried to stay awake . At one point we passed - I remember this - some barracks where moths and other bugs beat themselves silly against the rafter lights , and a soldier , just one , lit a cigarette , paying no attention to the insects or us . But after those barracks the endless chaparral just became more endless . I fell asleep , and I know my mother did too because she stopped talking something that was , as my uncles used to say with affection , " a very rare thing . " When the road turned bumpy , I woke up , sat up , and we were on a dirt road . In the distance ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see on country roads , wondering who lives there and what they 're doing and whether they would ask you in if your car broke down . In that light there were people , I always told myself ; people different from me , but still people , and was n't it an amazing thing , there in the darkness , miles from anywhere , a light that told the universe there were human beings there ? When my father slowed at last , the light became a shack - the kind you 'd imagine cowboys or sheep-herders would live in , except for a bunch of antennas on its roof - and we stopped . My father still said nothing . My mother was awake now , too , and we got out . At the door of the shack a man in civilian clothes - a red cowboy shirt and jeans ( I remember that , too ) - held the screen door for us as we went in , and he said , " Good to see you , Captain . Good to see you , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure . There was a table in the corner , under three bare light bulbs , and on the table was a machine of some kind - a machine with needles , the kind you 'd use to measure the waves of your brain - and I remember looking from my dad to the man in jeans , waiting for someone to say what the machine was , though no one did . I do n't know how I got close enough to see what the needles were doing , but I did . Maybe my dad pushed me closer . Maybe the man in jeans waved for me to step in . That 's the kind of thing memory often leaves out , though supposedly it 's all still deep inside us , should we ever need it . I do n't need it yet , I guess . All I really need to remember , to remember that night , is that I stood close enough to see the needles scratching rhythmically with their black ink while somewhere my mother and father watched too . We watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then the needles jumped suddenly , scratching furiously , and the man , who was somehow sitting at the table beside me now , looked around at my father and said , " This is it . " " Sputnik , " my father said , and I jumped at his voice . It was the first word he 'd spoken all night - at least that 's how it felt - and he was looking at both of us , my mom and me , as he said it . " It 's overhead , " he was saying . " Right now - is n't that right ? " The man in jeans nodded , his eyes on the ink . " The Russians are watching us , " my dad said . I remember thinking : This is what matters . Not that the Russians were watching ; and not that they could do this , my father and the civilian scientists he oversaw at the lab high on the Point - listening to it with needles and ink ; but that it was over us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night beyond the ceiling , a light no brighter than many stars , but moving across the sky and as much of a miracle . My mother started to say something - to ask a question maybe - but did n't , as if she were seeing it too : what really mattered . " Every night ? " my father asked . " Yes , Captain , " the man said . " Remarkable , is n't it . " " Yes . Does n't seem possible . " " No , Sir , it does n't . " We stared at the needles , listened to them quiet down , and seemed to be waiting . For what ? I wondered . The satellite would not come around again for a long time , would it ? Then the furious scratching started up again , much louder this time , and I knew this sound was what we 'd been waiting for . My father leaned in , as if the sudden shadow of ink on the long , endless paper that folded and folded again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what was above us now , even as the man in jeans made room for him , moving his chair , my father saying , " It 's bigger tonight . " " No . It 's just sending out more , Sir . " " More what ? " " Light - a kind of light .... " " One we ca n't see . " " Right . " My father nodded once-I remember that - and was silent again , and we all watched the paper turn black from the sudden bursts , as if a long finger , maybe God 's , were reaching down from the night sky to touch the table before us . " Do you see it ? " my father asked me . " Yes , Dad . " " Do you ? " he asked my mother , who nodded , saying , " It 's louder . " " Yes , it is , " he said . My dad nodded again , and I could tell it was time to go . He and the man shook hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man complimented my mother on something she was wearing - they 'd met before , I realized - and we walked to the screen door . I did n't want to leave . I could have stayed in the shack with the machine all night , waiting and watching . I REMEMBER THIS , too : looking through the rear windshield of our Chevrolet , watching the yellow light of the shack getting smaller behind us in the dark , and for a moment the little light seeming to brighten , seeming to rush at us like a voice , a presence as big as space itself , hoping to tell us something , but then it was quiet again , only the twinkling nurseryrhyme stars above us in the night as my mother said , " That was fascinating , Jimmie . " Then , as if time and space were caught in a stutter and we were caught in it , she repeated it : " That was fascinating , Jimmie . " " That was fascinating , Jimmie , " she said a third time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break free , but could n't . After a while - an hour maybe , maybe more - when I was still watching the road behind us and still shaking , though the voice and the light were gone - my father said quietly , " I - I wanted you both to see it . " " Yes , " my mother answered , and I said something too , our voices unsteady . Maybe it was to thank him . I do n't know exactly what we said , but I 'm sure we thanked him . " Will they ever know what it is ? " my mother asked , just once . My father did n't answer . He was breathing hard - I remember this now - I remember thinking how strange it was - and he was n't blinking . He was driving but not blinking . When he did speak , when he could speak , his voice was hoarse - I remember this , too - and it was to say , " I do n't think so . It comes when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's big and it 's got its own kind of light . " But he was n't thinking of its light , I knew . None of us were . We were thinking of the ink , there on the endless sheet of paper , the only thing we could really be sure of , the only thing we 'd later claim we remembered , though somewhere inside us we would hear the voice and remember everything , and it would make us shake . <p>
