More and more people each year are going abroad for Christmas . To celebrate the season of goodwill towards men , British Airways slams an extra one hundred and four pounds on each air ticket . But the airports are still jammed . For so many people are fleeing Christmas . Fed up with the fact that commercial Christmas starts in October . Fed up with carols . Dreading the arrival of Christmas cards from people they have forgotten to send a card to . Unable to bear yet another family get-together with Auntie Mary puking up in the corner after sampling too much of the punch . You see at the airports the triumphant glitter in the eyes of people who are leaving it all behind , including the hundredth rerun of Miracle on 34th Street . But in Lochdubh , in Sutherland , in the very far north of Scotland , there is nothing to flee from . Christmas , thought Hamish Macbeth gloomily , as he walked along the waterfront , his shoulders hunched against a tearing wind , was not coming to Lochdubh this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a strong Calvinist element in Lochdubh which frowned on Christmas . Christmas had nothing to do with the birth of Christ , they said , but was really the old Roman Saturnalia which the early Christians had taken over . And as for Santa Clausforget it . So there were no Christmas lights , no tree , nothing to sparkle in the dark winter . P. C. Hamish Macbeth was feeling particularly sour , for his family had taken off for Florida for a winter vacation . His mother had won a family holiday for thinking up a slogan for a new soap powder " Whiter Than The MountainSnow " and Hamish could not go with them . Sergeant Macgregor over at Cnothan was ill in hospital with a grumbling appendix and Hamish had been instructed to take over the sergeant 's beat as well as do his own . Hamish 's family were unusual in that they had always celebrated Christmastree , turkey , presents and all . In parts of the Highlands , like Lochdubh , the old spirit of John Knox still wandered , blasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival . Hamish had often pointed out that none other than Luther was credited with the idea of the Christmas tree , having been struck by the sight of stars shining through the branches of an evergreen . But to no avail . Lochdubh lay silent and dark beside the black waters of the loch . He turned back towards the police station . The wind was becoming even more ferocious . The wind of Sutherland can sound frightening as it moves up from ordinary tumult to a high-pitched screech and then a deep booming roar . Hamish decided to settle down with a glass of whisky in front of the television . He was just reaching up for the whisky bottle in one of the kitchen cupboards when he realized he had not checked the answering machine . He went through to the police office . There was one message , and it was Mrs. Gallagher saying she wanted him to call on her immediately as she wished to report a burglary . Hamish groaned . " This is all I need , " he said to the dingy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallagher . She was a tough , wiry old lady who ran her small croft single-handed . She lived out on the Cnothan road and was generally detested . She was described as crabbit , meaning " sourpuss . " Mrs. Gallagher never had a good word to say for anybody . She had a genius for sniffing out the vulnerable points in anyone 's character and going in for the kill . In the far north of Scotland in winter , there are only a few hours of daylight . Hamish glanced at his watch . " Three o'clock and black as hell already , " he muttered . The wind cut like a knife as he climbed into the police Land Rover . As he held the wheel tightly against the buffeting of the wind and drove along the curving road out of the village , he realized that he had never questioned Mrs. Gallagher 's bitterness . It had simply been one of those unpleasant facts of his existence since he had started policing in Lochdubh . At last he bumped up the rutted track leading to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head against the ferocity of the wind , he rapped at the door . He waited as he heard her fumbling with locks and bolts . What was she afraid of ? Most crofters did n't bother locking their doors . Then he saw the gleam of an eye through the door , which she opened on a chain . She had always had all those locks . How on earth could anyone manage to get in and burgle her ? " Police , " he said . The chain dropped and the door opened wide . " Come ben , " she said curtly . He ducked his head and followed her in . As in most croft houses , the kitchen was used as a living room with the parlour being kept for " best . " That meant the parlour was usually only used for weddings and funerals . Mrs. Gallagher 's kitchen was cosy and cheerful , belying the permanently sour expression on her face . She had a mass of thick crinkly pepper-and-salt hair . The skin of her face was like old leather , beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were that peculiar light grey , almost silver , you still see in the Highlands . Emotions flitted over the surface of such eyes like cloud shadows on the sea and yet rarely gave anything away . " What 's been taken ? " asked Hamish . " Sit down and stop looming over me , " she snapped . Hamish obediently sat down . " My cat , Smoky 's been stolen . " Hamish had started to tug out his notebook , then left it alone . " How long 's the cat been gone ? " " Twenty-four hours . " " Look here , Mrs. Gallagher , it 's probably strayed , gone wild or been killed by the fox . " Like " the devil , " it was always " the fox " in the Highlands of Scotland , where crofters had no sentimentality about an animal they damned as the worst piece of vermin in the countryside . " Havers ! " said Mrs. Gallagher . " If I say it is stolen , then it is stolen and it is your duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look around for it , " said Hamish , struggling to rise out of the low chair on which he was sitting . " Is there any sign of a break-in ? Any doors , locks or windows been tampered with ? " " Not a sign . But they could be too cunning for the likes of you . I want you to get a SOCO team out here , " said Mrs. Gallagher . Hamish , who watched police soaps as well , knew she meant a Scene of Crime Operatives team . " Smoky was here with me . He did n't go out . " " Did you go out yourself ? " " Yes , I went to feed the sheep . " " And would n't Smoky nip out after you ? " " No , Smoky never goes out until dinnertime . " Hamish interpreted " dinnertime " to mean midday . In most houses in and around Lochdubh , dinner was still in the middle of the day and high tea , that is , one course followed by bread and scones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . " I can not order a forensic team frae Strathbane for a missing cat , " said Hamish . " Anyway , they chust would n't come . " " Your trouble , " said Mrs. Gallagher , " is that you are lazy . That is why you are still unmarried . You are too damn lazy to get off your scrawny backside to even court a lassie . " Hamish stood up and looked down at her . " I will look around outside for your cat and post a notice at the police station , " he said evenly . " That iss all I can do . " His Highland accent became more sibilant when he was angry or distressed . " You have not even checked the doors or windows to see where they might have got in ! " shouted Mrs. Gallagher . " I 'll report you . " " Do that . " Hamish put on his cap and let himself out . The wind had died as suddenly as it had sprung up . It was still blowing hard far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing across a small cold moon . He set off over the surrounding fields calling " Smoky ! " but there was no sign of any cat . He wearily returned to the croft house and knocked on the door . Again he waited and called out " Police " in answer to her sharp demand to know who was there . " Have you got a photo of the cat ? " he called . After some time , the door opened on the chain . She handed a photograph to him . " I want a receipt , " she said . He wrote out a receipt and went on his way . ***** The next day , Hamish forgot about the cat . He had a more important burglary to investigate in a neighboring village . Cnothan , less rigid on the subject of Christmas than Lochdubh , had planned to decorate its main street with fairy lights . Now they were gone . He set out , enjoying the faint glow from a red sun which shone low on the hills . All was still after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage chimneys in straight lines . The waters of the sea loch were flat and still , one great mirror reflecting the clouds and mountains above . Hamish did not like Cnothan , the least friendly place in the Highlands . He marvelled that Cnothan of all places should want to brighten the place up with lights . He went to the home of the chairman of the parish council , a Mr. Sinclair , who had reported the burglary . The door was opened by Mrs. Sinclair who told him he would find her husband at his shop in the main street . The shop , it turned out , sold electrical goods . Hamish grinned . Nothing like Highland enterprise when it came to making money . Mr. Sinclair was a smooth , pompous man . There is not much of a pecking order in the north of Scotland and so often the shopkeeper is head of the social world . He had an unlined olive face , despite his age which Hamish judged to be around fifty . His unnaturally black hair was combed straight back and oiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking around . " No , we didnae have the lights here , " said Mr. Sinclair . " They were kept in a shed up by the community hall . " " Maybe you 'd better take me there . " " You 'll need to wait until I 'm closed for lunch . This is my busiest season . " Hamish looked around the empty shop . " Does n't look busy now . " " Temporary lull . Temporary lull . " Hamish looked at his watch . Ten to one . Oh , well , only ten minutes to wait . Sod 's law , he thought bitterly as a woman came in at exactly two minutes to one and started asking about washing machines . It was quarter past one before she finished asking questions and left without buying anything . " I hate that sort of woman , " grumbled Mr. Sinclair after he had locked up and led the way up the main street at a brisk trot . " I think they come in just to pass the time . Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A smashed padlock lay on the ground . " Did they take anything other than the lights ? " asked Hamish . " Yes , " said Mr. Sinclair . " They took the big Christmas tree as well . " " Och , man , someone must hae seen someone carrying a great big tree ! " " You can ask . I 've asked . Has anyone seen a thing ? No . " Hamish squatted down and studied the ground . " There 's no dragging marks , " he said . " Must have been more than one o ' them . How big was the tree ? " " About eight feet . " " Aye , well , one man would ha ' dragged it . So it was several of them . And no one saw them . So it stands to reason they must have gone up the back way . " He stood up and looked down at Mr. Sinclair from his greater height . " I never heard afore that the folks of Cnothan wanted anything to do with Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year and I managed to persuade them . I was backed by the minister . We took up a collection . " " And your shop supplied the lights ? " " Yes . Do you mind if I get home for something to eat ? " " You run along . I 'll let you know if I find out anything . " Behind the community hall , Hamish noticed common grazing land . There was a gate leading into it . Hamish bent down again . There were little bits of fir needles on the ground . So they had gone this way . Where to ? Who would want to take a Christmas tree and lights ? After searching around some more , he went into a cafe and ordered a sausage roll and a cup of coffee . The roll was greasy and the coffee , weak . He approached the slattern who ran the cafe and asked , " Are there folks in Cnothan who were against having Christmas lights in the main street ? " She blinked at him through the steam from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unkempt hair , her thin face and red eyes , she looked like one of the witches who had appeared to the other Macbeth . " Aye , there 's some o ' those , " she said . " Like who ? " " Like Hugh McPhee . He went on and on about them . " " And where can I find him ? " " Down at the fishing shop by the loch . " At the bottom of the main street lay the loch , one of those products of the hydro-electricity board . Hamish could remember his mother telling him about how people had been moved out of their villages to make way for these artificial lochs . But they had all been promised that water power would mean cheap electricity and only found out too late that the resultant electricity was not cheap at all . There was a drowned village under Loch Cnothan at the far end . There was something dismal about these man-made stretches of water , he reflected . There were n't any of the trees and bushes around them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the loch was a great ugly dam . The sun was already going down when Hamish reached Mr. McPhee 's shop . Mr. McPhee sat like a gnome behind the counter of his dark shop among fishing tackle . Hamish explained the purpose of his visit . " So what 's it got to do with me ? " asked Mr. McPhee . He was a small gnarled man with arthritic hands . " I heard you were against the whole business o ' the lights , " said Hamish . " ' Course I was . It was that man , Sinclair . Get 's hisself elected tae the council and afore you know it , he 's got an order for the lights . " " So you were n't objecting on religious grounds ? " " No , you 'll need tae go tae Bessie Ward for that . She says the lights are the devil 's beacons . " " And where will I find her ? " " Her cottage is at the top o ' the main street . It 's called Crianlarich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back up the main street . It was bitter cold and the light was fading fast . He found a small bungalow with the legend CRIANLARICH done in pokerwork on a small wooden board hung over the door on two chains . He rang the doorbell , which played a parody of Big Ben . " What is it ? Is it my sister , Annie ? " asked a solid-looking matron on seeing a uniformed policeman . " No , nothing like that , " said Hamish soothingly . " I am asking questions about the missing Christmas lights . " " Whoever did it was doing the work of the Lord , " she said . " You 'd best come in . " Hamish followed her into a highly disciplined living room . Church magazines on a low table were arranged in neat squares . Brass objects on the mantel glittered and shone . Cushions were plumped up . Against the outside streetlights , the windows sparkled . The room was cold . Hamish took off his cap and balanced it on his knees . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any idea who did it , " began Hamish . " I neither know nor care . " Mrs. Ward sat down opposite him . Her tight tweed skirt rucked up over her thick legs , showing the embarrassed Hamish support hose ending in long pink knickers , those old-fashioned kind with elastic at the bottoms . " The Lord moves in mysterious ways , " she added sententiously . Hamish was about to point out that the Lord did not break padlocks but did not want to offend her . " You look like a verra intelligent woman tae me , " he said . Mrs. Ward preened and a coquettish look appeared in her eyes as she surveyed the tall policeman with the hazel eyes and flaming red hair . " Have there be any strangers around here ? " " There 's some come and go for the forestry . It 's all the fault of that awful man , Sinclair . You know the reason he forced through the collection for the lights ? Because he sold them . " " But if there was enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it follows that some of the people here want them . " " I blame the incomers , " she snapped . " Godless lot . " Hamish did not bother asking who the incomers were . She probably meant people who had settled in Cnothan during the last twenty years . Once a newcomer , always a newcomer . That 's the way things were in Cnothan . And you never really got to know anyone in Cnothan . In other villages , he called in at houses on his beat for a chat . He had never dared make an unofficial call on anyone in Cnothan . He surmised that such a respectable house-proud matron would not have anything to do with a theft . He was suddenly anxious to take his leave . But Mrs. Ward pressed him to stay for tea and he weakly agreed . After he left , he took in great gulps of fresh air outside . He felt he had been trapped in that glittering living room forever . He decided to go back to Lochdubh . In friendly Lochdubh where everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up news of any strangers in the area . He was sure it was the work of strangers . Surely even the most rabid Calvinist would not stoop to crime . Back in Lochdubh , he parked the Land Rover and walked along to the doctor 's cottage . Angela Brodie , the doctor 's wife , answered the door to him . " Come in , Hamish , " she said , putting a wisp of hair back from her thin face . " I 'm just decorating the Christmas tree . " " I 'm glad someone in Lochdubh has a Christmas tree , " remarked Hamish . " Come on , Hamish , you know a lot of us have them behind closed doors . " She led the way into the cluttered sitting room . The tree was half decorated and Angela 's cats were having a great game swiping at the brightly colored glass balls with their paws . Angela gave a cluck of annoyance and scooped up the cats and carried them out to the kitchen . " So what have you been up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about the theft of the Cnothan lights . " There was a lot of feeling against having the lights by some of the older residents , " said Angela . " Might not one of them have taken them ? " " No , I do n't think so . You see a large Christmas tree was taken as well . If someone wanted to stop the lights and tree being put up for religious reasons , then they 'd probably have smashed the lights and chopped up the tree . Someone 's probably down in the streets of Inverness or somewhere like that trying to sell them . In fact , when I get back to the police station , I 'll phone the police in Inverness and Strathbane and ask them to keep a lookout for the missing lights . " Hamish passed a pleasant hour helping Angela with the decorations and then went back to the police station . He went into the office and played back the messages on the answering machine . There was a curt one from the bane of his life , Detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his return . Hamish rang police headquarters and was put through to Blair . " Listen , pillock , " said Blair with all his usual truculence , " there 's some auld biddie in your neck o ' the woods , a Mrs. Gallagher . " " What about her ? She 's only missing a cat . " " Well , find the damn animal . She 's complained about you , right to Superintendent Daviot . Says you 're lazy and neglecting your duties . Says you 're a disgrace to community policing . " Hamish sighed . Community policing were the current buzzwords at Strathbane . " So you get out there and find that cat , dead or alive . " " Yes . " " Yes , what ? " " Yes , sir . " Hamish rang off . He decided to eat first and then tackle the horrible Mrs. Gallagher again . ***** An hour and a half later , he knocked once more at Mrs. Gallagher 's cottage . Frost was glittering on the grass round about and his breath came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unlocked and the bolts were drawn back . She let him in . He was about to give her a row for having made trouble for him at headquarters , but he noticed she had been crying and his face softened . " Look , Mrs. Gallagher , " he said gently , " I was not neglecting my duties . But you must know what it 's like . The cat could be anywhere . And why would anyone break in and steal a cat ? And how could anyone break in with all the locks and bolts you have ? You even have bolts on the windows . " " Someone did , " she said stubbornly . " Have you ever been burgled afore ? " " No , never . " " So why all the locks and bolts ? " " There 's a lot of evil people around . And unintelligent ones , too . If you had any intelligence , you would n't still be a policeman . " " I choose to stay a policeman , " said Hamish , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " It was amazing how little anyone knew of Mrs. Gallagher , he reflected , even though she had been in Lochdubh longer than himself . But then she was damned as a nasty old woman and that was that . It must be a lonely life and she had been crying over the loss of her cat . " Let 's start again , Mrs. Gallagher , " he said firmly , " and stop the insults or we wo n't get anywhere . The mystery here , and it iss where I would like to start , is why you bar and bolt yourself in and why you should immediately think that someone had broken in . " She sat very still , her red work-worn hands folded on her aproned lap . " Ca n't you just find Smoky ? " she pleaded at last . " I 'm giving a talk at the school tomorrow and I 'll ask the children if they 'll help me to look for Smoky . School 's nearly finished . But you have not yet answered my question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you are afraid of , Mrs. Gallagher ? " She studied him for a long moment with those odd silver eyes of hers . Then she said abruptly , " Will you be taking a dram with me ? " " Aye , that would be grand . " A flash of humor lit her eyes . " I thought you did n't drink on duty . " " Only on a cold winter 's night , " said Hamish . She went to a handsome dresser against the wall and took out two glasses and a bottle of malt whisky . She poured two generous measures , gave him one and then sat back down in her chair , cradling her glass . " Slainte ! " said Hamish , raising his glass with the Gallic toast . " Slainte , " she echoed . The peat fire sent out a puff of aromatic smoke and an old clock on the mantel gave an asthmatic wheeze before chiming out the hour . " So , " said Hamish curiously , " what brought you up here ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a farm . " " Where ? " " Over near Oban . I knew I could make a go of it myself . " " You must know country people and country ways . Why all the security ? " A little sigh escaped her . " I always thought one day he would come back . " " He ? " " My husband . " " I thought you were a widow . " " I hope I am . It 's been a long time . " " Was he violent ? " Again that sigh . " There you have it . Yes . " " Tell me about it . " " No , it 's my business . Finish your drink and go . " Hamish studied her . " Was he in prison ? " " Get out of here , you tiresome man . I 'm weary . " Hamish finished his drink and stood up . " Think about it , " he said . " There 's no use asking the police for help and then withholding information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . He stood looking down at her for a few moments and then he put on his cap and let himself out . His Highland curiosity was rampant . Why had he never stopped before to wonder about Mrs. Gallagher ? She would appear in the village from time to time to stock up on groceries . If someone tried to speak to her she would be so cutting and rude that gradually she had come to be left alone . In the morning he would visit one of the older residents and see if he could find out some facts about her mysterious husband .
