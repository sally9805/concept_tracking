Chapter One Kathleen waited in the cold rain of a Seattle winter as her brother placed her suitcase in the trunk of his car . She felt as awkward and disoriented as she probably looked , standing there in her unfashionable wool coat and clumsy black shoes . For the last ten years she 'd been Sister Kathleen , high school teacher and part-time bookkeeper for St. Peter 's parish in Minneapolis . Her identity had been defined by her vocation . Now she was simply Kathleen . And all she 'd managed to accumulate in her years of service was one flimsy suitcase and a wounded heart . She had no savings , no prospects and no home . For the first time in her life , she was completely on her own . " I 'll do whatever I can to help you , " Sean said , opening the car door for her . " You already have . " Tears stung her eyes as her brother backed out of his driveway . She 'd spent the last two months living at his house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't thank you enough , " she whispered , not wanting him to hear the emotion in her voice . " Mom and Dad want you to come home . " " I ca n't . " How did a woman who was nearly thirty years old go home ? She was n't a teenager who 'd been away at school , a girl who could easily slip back into her childhood life . " They 'd never think of you as a burden , if that 's what you 're worried about , " her brother said . Perhaps not , but Kathleen was a disappointment to her family and she knew it . She did n't have the emotional strength to answer her parents ' questions . Dealing with her new life was complicated enough . " You 're going to be all right , " Sean assured her . " I know . " But Kathleen did n't entirely believe it . The world outside the convent was a frightening place . She did n't know what to expect or how to cope with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Loren or me anytime . " " Thank you . " She swallowed hard . Ten minutes later , Sean pulled up in front of the House of Peace , a home run by former nuns who helped others make the often-difficult transition from religious to secular life . Kathleen stared at the large two-story white house . There was a trimmed laurel hedge on either side of the narrow walk-way that led to the porch . She saw the welcoming glow of lamplight in the windows , dispersing a little of the day 's gloom . Still , she missed the order and ritual of her life . There was a certain comfort she had n't appreciated : rising , praying and eating , all in perfect synchronization with the day before . Freedom , unfamiliar as it was , felt frightening . Confusing . With her brother at her side , Kathleen walked up the steps , held her breath and then , after a long moment , pressed the doorbell . Someone must have been on the other side waiting , because it opened immediately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty with short white hair and a pleasantly round figure greeted her . " I 'm Kay Dickson . We spoke on the phone . " Kathleen felt warmed by Kay 's smile . " Come in , come in . " The other woman held open the door for them . Sean hesitated as he set down Kathleen 's suitcase . " I should be getting back home . " His eyes questioned her , as if he was unsure about leaving his sister at this stranger 's house . " I 'll be fine , " she told him , and in that instant she knew it was true . " Angie , come here , " her father called in heavily accented English . " Taste this . " He held out a wooden spoon dripping with rich marinara sauce . Obediently Angelina put her mouth over the spoon and closed her eyes , distinguishing the different spices and flavors as they met her tongue . " Not enough basil . You should add fresh chopped parsley , too . " Her father roared with approval . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant 's large stainless steel sink . Then he reached for eight-year-old Angie and lifted her high in the air before hugging her tightly . It was 1948 , and Angie 's world revolved around her father and , of course , the family-owned business , the restaurant named after her . It was a well-known fact that Angelina 's served the finest Italian food in all of Buffalo , New York . Unlike other children her age , Angie 's first memories were n't of being plopped on Santa 's knee in some department store for a candy cane and a photograph . Instead , she recalled the pungent scent of garlic simmering in extra-virgin olive oil and the soft hum as her mother bustled about the kitchen . Those were the warm years , the good years , during the big war , before her mother died in 1945 . Sometimes , late at night , she 'd heard giggles coming from her parents ' bedroom . She liked the sound and cuddled up in her thick blankets , her world secure despite all the talk of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother who sang her songs and loved her so much was suddenly gone ; she 'd died giving birth to Angie 's stillborn brother . For a while , any hint of joy and laughter disappeared from the house . A large black wreath hung on the front door , and people stopped , stared and shook their heads as they walked past . Only five years old , Angie did n't understand where her mother had vanished , nor did it make sense when strangers crowded into her home . She was even more confused by the way they put their heads together and whispered as if she was n't supposed to hear . A few wept openly , stopping abruptly when she entered the room . All Angie understood was that her mother was gone and her father , her fun-loving , gregarious father , had grown quiet and serious and sad . " You 're going to be a good Catholic girl , " he told her soon after her mother 's death . " I promised your mother I 'd raise you in the Church . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he insisted . " We live in America . " " Yes , Daddy . " " I 'll take you to Mass every Sunday , just like your mother wanted . " Angie listened intently . " And when you start first grade you 'll attend St. Gabriel , so the nuns can teach you . " She nodded ; her father made this sound like a promise . " It 's just you and me now , Angelina , " he whispered . ( Continues ... )
