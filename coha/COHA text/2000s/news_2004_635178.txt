<p> With the new " Trampin ' , " the fourth album that Patti Smith has released since she returned to performing in 1996 , the Chicago native turned legendary godmother of punk has given us what may be her most political recording . <p> Like her old friend and collaborator , Bruce Springsteen , Smith felt compelled to comment about 9/11 and the war in Iraq , but she goes much further than the Boss did on " The Rising . " The music may lack the ferocious drive of her best early work  --  there 's no " Free Money " or " Gloria " here , just a lot of quieter folk-rock  --  but the outspoken poet and singer has lost none of her courage or conviction when it comes to speaking out . <p> I talked with Smith by phone as she was in the midst of a tour that brings her to the Skyline Stage at Navy Pier on Thursday night . <p> Q. You 're on a short list of artists who 've dared to take an outspoken political stand in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that regard ? <p> A. Well , I think like all our records , it takes a while for a record to permeate the public consciousness , but I 've actually been pretty pleased with the reception . Anyone that hears it seems to really like it and to appreciate its breadth . There are some people that seem very reactionary about certain political ideas , but I think that the record is n't as political as it is humanistic . That 's why a song like " Radio Baghdad "  --  which is obviously from the point of view of myself , a person who was against the strike on Iraq  --  that 's why the actual piece is from the point of view of a mother . I felt like one ca n't argue the position of a mother trying to protect her children . <p> " Radio Baghdad " is from the point of view of an Iraqi woman who loves her country , who is recounting the history of her country and her city , but also is trying to protect her children the night that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a human being . I 'm a mother . And I can look at things from a mother 's point of view . <p> Q. That 's the other concept that permeates the entire record  --  the notion of motherhood . <p> A. It was completely conscious , because when I stood back and examined it , it was obvious , and there are obvious reasons : My mother had passed away right before we started writing songs . I know her spirit is within me ; it also permeates the album . But thematically , it just evolved that way . <p> " Jubilee " is about having the sort of **28;752;TOOLONG person praising her land but also being considerate about the state of things and the people . " Mother Rose " is a song for my mom . " Cartwheels " is for my daughter , and " Radio Baghdad " is from the mother 's point of view . It moves right through the album . <p> Q. Were you consciously trying to make a connection between " Radio Baghdad " and your earlier song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened organically . I mean , there 's an obvious connection . The way the song evolved , I came into our practice room and guitarist Oliver Ray had written the chords and the riff and the structure , and the band was jamming on it . I stood there and listened to this music  --  and we had just bombed Iraq and Baghdad  --  and I had an instantaneous vision that this piece of music would be an improvised field on those chords and that it should be called " Radio Baghdad . " So , obviously , it does resonate with " Radio Ethiopia , " with the same type of idea . <p> I was very concerned about the state of things in Ethiopia at the time 1976  --  there was a famine  --  and I was concerned about the Ethiopian people . Those concerns came out abstractly on an improvised field . So , in that way , there are similarities . <p> Q. This album does seem to have the loosest feel of any of the records you 've made since you returned to performing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-jazz areas you first explored with the " Radio Ethiopia " album ? <p> A. Well , we do move into that area on every record . There are songs on every single one of my records that were completely improvised in the studio , from " Birdland " to " Memento Mori " ; " Peace and Noise , " " Gung Ho , " " Strange Messenger . " We do improvise , but this particular album has two very focused improvisations , " Gandhi , " and " Radio Baghdad . " Just as a band , we 've been together now over eight years , we have a lot of confidence and trust in each other , we produced the record ourselves , so the whole album reflects only us . <p> Q. Is it odd to think that at this point , this group has been together longer than the original Patti Smith Group ? <p> A. Yes , but also , in a way , it makes sense , because I created my first group with a specific mission . That specific mission was finite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire others , or to inspire some kind of movement in rock ' n ' roll , or to return rock ' n ' roll to the hands of the people . I felt that the mission I tried to accomplish was accomplished , but with these musicians , it was a different type of mission . This mission is very work-oriented ; it 's not as conceptual . We 're working on things and evolving , and we 're not trying to create a new movement as I was hoping to in the ' 70s . We 're trying to continue to contribute and respond to the world around us . <p> Q. Many people say that rock ' n ' roll just does n't have the same cultural force that it had in the ' 60s and ' 70s . Certainly , very few artists have come forward to talk as directly about the current political situation . <p> A. Well , you 're absolutely right . I do n't know exactly why . I know , in terms of the atmosphere in the country , I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fear in our country . And fear and nationalism do not produce art  --  or they produce reactive art . I ca n't really account for why else certain artists did n't respond or speak out anymore than I can account for why our Congress did n't oppose Bush when he wanted a blank check to strike Iraq . There was so little dissent in our own Congress . One would have to really speak to these people and ask them , " Why would you stay silent ? " <p> You would think learned people should know the difference between patriotism and nationalism . You read the Declaration of Independence  --  Jefferson clearly points out that we have to be vigilant , and if our government is n't serving us properly , turn it over ! I mean , it 's a very revolutionary document . He did not want to create an atmosphere for Americans to be sheep . I thought the fact that no one questioned or fought against him was very unpatriotic . <p> Q. But when you look at your kids and their generation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n ' roll to have the power that it had  --  or that poetry or theater had  --  for your generation in the ' 60s and the ' 70s ? <p> A. I think it always has the power . I always have faith that a new breed or a new guard will be the next Paul Reveres and wake the people up , and the other people will follow . I believe in change . If it is n't one generation , it 'll be the next generation . <p> Just because things are n't going our way does n't mean we turn away . We have to keep setting examples . That 's why somebody like Ralph Nader keeps doing his work . I know people do n't understand that , or they fear that , but people have to keep setting examples for the future . Like William Blake  --  he was poverty-stricken at his death , he was ridiculed in his life , he was misunderstood , he never had any success , people did n't buy his work , they did n't display his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathbed still working on his etchings and his drawings , and he set an example for us all to work under those conditions  --  to keep a hold of your visions . I always try to use that as counsel . <p> Q. Is n't that a piece of Blake 's art on the opening page of your Web site ( www.pattismith.net ) ? <p> A. Yes , that 's " Glad Day . " In fact , the first line of our album is , " Oh glad day . " And " Glad Day " is the name of the painting with the arms outstretched . <p> Q. Let 's switch gears : There 's been quite a bit of controversy in Chicago between filmmakers David Thomas and Laurel Legler and the surviving members of the MC5 , particularly Wayne Kramer , who are blocking the release of their film , " MC5 : A True Testimonial . " You were married to the late MC5 guitarist Fred " Sonic " Smith . Where do you stand on the issue ? <p> A. I feel very sad about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son has seen it . He thinks it 's great . He really wanted to see it come out . I mean , I 've done everything that I can legally do to help them . The MC5 era was before my time , so I know very little about it , except that I hope that the filmmakers get a chance to distribute their film . I do n't have very much respect for Wayne Kramer as a human being , so I ca n't really make any judgment . I have n't found him to be an honorable person . I should n't comment on it because I have n't seen the film , but I take my son 's word that it was good and good for his dad . <p> They were a great band and they should be remembered . And they should be remembered together . This film is a very good opportunity to give them recognition . I do n't understand why he would want to block it except for monetary reasons . The only reason I have n't seen it is just it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just painful . <p> Q. Another piece of ancient history that I 've always wanted to ask you about , if you 'll indulge me , is your roots as a rock critic . You contributed to Creem magazine along with Lester Bangs , Nick Tosches , and Richard Meltzer , and Tosches wrote the lyrics for your song " Distant Fingers . " I 'm curious to know your thoughts about that era of rock criticism . <p> A. Well , they were pioneers . I did some writing in that period , but not as much as any of them . These people and people like Paul Williams were very dedicated . Writing about rock ' n ' roll was evolving , and the writers were evolving just as the form was evolving . I think that everyone was interested in merging various things in one form : revolution , poetry , politics . The difference perhaps between me and some of these writers is that I did not become disillusioned in my life , nor did I destroy myself with substance abuse . I think that , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their contribution was great . It was a great energy . They had a lot of belief . If I noted anything , though , a lot of writers became quite cynical , and I think that 's because as they evolved , they got too involved in lifestyle  --  as a lot of musicians and a lot of people got so involved in lifestyle  --  and the content of the work suffered . And cynicism is not a good place to work from . <p> Q. How have you avoided that sort of cynicism or self-destruction ? Both are such a big part of rock ' n ' roll , and so many people fall into those traps . <p> A. I think the thing is one has to focus on the work ; that to me is always the most important . It 's always the work . Their life can always be interesting and romantic , but it 's nothing without the work . <p> I cherish work . Through my life , I like looking cool , the power of the image , and I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had orange pants like George Harrison , an outfit like Bob Dylan on the cover of Tarantula , and I dressed like Baudelaire . I still enjoy those things , but they were what they were , and what was always the most important to me was to do good work . The other stuff was either fun or peripheral . When material things like lifestyle or image come first , that 's what you 're going to be left with . That 's not going to endure . People are n't going to remember that . <p> Pop Music Critic Jim DeRogatis co-hosts " Sound Opinions , " the world 's only rock ' n ' roll talk show , at 11 p.m .
