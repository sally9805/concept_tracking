<p> This spring , when crews rip up a funky old Mission Street parking lot to make way for two new museums and a palm-studded granite plaza , the last piece of undeveloped property in San Francisco 's vast 40-year Yerba Buena redevelopment project will start to take shape . <p> Today , the Board of Supervisors is expected to give the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency the go-ahead to issue $43.1 million in bonds for the construction of Jessie Square on a 1-acre site next to historic St. Patrick 's Church and directly across Mission Street from Yerba Buena Gardens . The money will pay for the plaza , a 450-space underground garage , a pedestrian lane linking Market and Mission streets , and the foundations for the Magnes and Mexican museums . <p> But exactly what shape the Magnes Museum will assume is anybody 's guess . Barring a sudden economic turnaround , the dramatic design created for the museum by star architect Daniel Libeskind probably wo n't be built as it was presented and approved by the city three years ago . <p> Facing serious financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions that merged last year  --  Berkeley 's venerable Judah L. Magnes Museum and the Jewish Museum San Francisco  --  the museum laid off eight of its 19 employees in November and is rethinking how it can build new homes on both sides of the bay . <p> " It 's our earnest desire to build a museum at Yerba Buena , " said Warren Hellman , the well known San Francisco equity investor and philanthropist who became chairman of the nonprofit Magnes Museum 's board in October . " How soon we 're going to be able to do that I do n't know . We wo n't have the money until the economic climate improves . " <p> DEFICIT REDUCTION <p> Hellman and the board 's new co-chairman , Daniel Offit , found themselves at the helm of an organization with a $2 million budget shortfall  --  the deficit has since been reduced to about $170,000 through job cuts and the use of some endowment money , Hellman says  --  and in the middle of a heated debate over the institution 's future . <p> The merger came about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same funds and could n't achieve their capital campaign goals . The Jewish Museum San Francisco , which had no collection to speak of but specialized in contemporary art exhibitions dealing with Jewish themes and ideas , had a $100 million capital campaign to build and endow the Yerba Buena museum . It stalled and now stands at about $20 million . Donors withdrew several million dollars when the project did n't move forward , Hellman says . The old Magnes Museum , which ran in the red , was n't making headway with its $40 million campaign to build a bigger home on Allston Way in downtown Berkeley . <p> The Berlin-based Libeskind , whose proposal for ground zero in New York City is considered a front-runner , envisioned dynamic sculptural forms in the shape of the Hebrew word chai , or life , projecting from the 1907 red-brick Pacific Gas and Electric Co. substation on Jessie Street . The facade of that vacant Willis Polk-designed landmark will stay , but what goes inside remains to be seen . <p> Hellman , who 's working on a deal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on property purchased by the Judah L. Magnes Museum in 1997 , figures the cost of the San Francisco project will have to be cut in half from the original $60 million estimate . Museum officials have had informal conversations with Libeskind about scaling back the design . <p> " We had become too ambitious in our planning for the new museum , " says board member Joyce Linker , who was president of the Jewish Museum San Francisco board in the booming 1990s , when the Yerba Buena site was acquired . The idea was to expose Jewish culture and thought to a wider public in " an architectural gem " in the heart of the city 's cultural district . " Now we 're thinking about a smaller building with a smaller operating budget . How that smaller building will look , I do n't know . It 's unlikely that it will be the Libeskind design as we know it . " <p> DIFFERENT GOALS <p> Passionate supporters of the old Judah L. Magnes charge that the San Francisco contingent is more interested in having a signature building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationally known collection of Jewish art and artifacts , rare books , manuscripts and archival material . <p> Their fears were exacerbated when most of the members of the small staff at the Russell Street museum in Berkeley were laid off , among them two of the three curators , one of whom had been there 28 years . Seventeen volunteer docents quit in protest . <p> " There 's been a vicious battle going on for the soul of the institution , " says film producer Deborah Kaufman , the founder and former director of the Jewish Film Festival , which began at the Magnes Museum . " I 'm worried about the destruction of one of the great jewels of American Jewish life . " <p> So is Seymour Fromer , the former director who founded the Judah L. Magnes Museum in 1962 with his wife , Rebecca . " It worked out to be a hostile takeover , the end result being the staff and mission of the old Magnes were destroyed , " says Fromer , who is meeting Tuesday at Russell Street with members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the museum 's direction . <p> Some of the criticism has been directed at the museum 's executive director , Connie Wolf , who says that the merger has been tough on everybody and that the charge of a takeover is unfounded . <p> " Both institutions came to the merger with strengths and challenges , each had assets and each had liabilities , " says Wolf , who took a 25 percent salary cut and points out that an equal number of employees was laid off in San Francisco , among them the deputy director for programs . <p> " We are committed to preserving and caring for the collection . Our goal is to take care of the collection and make it accessible . Change is hard , and this economy is really hard . We have to figure out how to get by with less . " <p> A month ago , Hellman , who has an affection for the old Magnes  --  the museum 's Western Jewish History Center contains photographs of his great-grandfather , Wells Fargo chief executive I.W. Hellman  --  felt there was so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being separate groups . <p> NEW COOPERATION <p> But after meeting with the full board , he came to the opposite conclusion . " People really want to try now . They looked at the abyss , which is de-merge , and both sides are saying , ' Let 's not do that . ' I think people are saying , ' Let 's put down the weapons and try to work together . ' " <p> He has reassured the Berkeley contingent that the Russell Street museum , a big house on a quiet , leafy block , will stay open until the Allston space gets built . For now , exhibitions will alternate between Russell Street and the San Francisco facility on Steuart Street . Hellman and board member Felix Warburg , a San Francisco architect who was on the old Magnes board , are working on a deal with a developer to build apartments on the Allston site , with the museum on the bottom two floors . Ideally the museum would only pay to move in . Last week , it paid off the property 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new San Francisco Magnes Museum may be up in the air , but not the new 63,000-square-foot Mexican Museum , a sculptured red stone-clad structure designed by the esteemed Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta . <p> The Redevelopment Agency , which had originally pledged to pay $7.5 million  --  half the building 's estimated cost in 1995  --  is now paying the full $18.2 million cost because the museum could n't raise the other half . The agency , which will own the building and rent it back to the museum for $1 a year , will pay for the construction of the shell , and the museum will pay to finish the interior . So far , the museum has raised $3 million of its $5.8 million goal , said Patrick O'Donahue , the museum 's interim executive director . <p> " It brings a cultural diversity to Yerba Buena that has been an objective of the agency for the last decade or so , " says Bill Carney , senior project manager of the Yerba Buena Center Redevelopment Area . <p> SITE HISTORY <p> The entire Jessie Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that built Metreon across the street and the Four Seasons hotel that towers behind the PG &E; substation . The site , like much of 87-acre Yerba Buena project , was originally supposed to be developed by Olympia &; York . But when that developer went bankrupt in the early ' 90s , the lot remained undeveloped . This complex deal was hammered out by 1998 , with Millennium paying for and owning the underground garage . But when the economic downturn hit , followed by Sept. 11 , it became more financially feasible for the city to build and own the garage , Carney said . <p> " Jessie Square means the completion of the the Yerba Buena Redevelopment Area , which has become a key attraction for the city , both for residents and visitors , " Carney said <p> The agency is operating under the assumption that Magnes Museum will be built as planned  --  the whole project is scheduled for completion by the end of 2005  --  " but I understand they 're considering their options . We expect them to fulfill their agreement to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come back to us with some changes , " said Carney . <p> E-mail Jesse Hamlin at jhamlin@sfchronicle.com.
