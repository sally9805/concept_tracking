In the Beginning // October 1997 // I think I need to start at the beginning of my whole health crisis and catch you up to the day I finally got diagnosed . I say " finally " because it took forever  --  more than two years and eight doctors  --  before one of them decided to give me a D&amp;C , which stands for " dilatation and curettage , " whatever the hell that is . Basically , it 's when they scrape tissue from the uterus for biopsy . In the end , this was the only test I needed to find my cancer . Because I was atypical for contracting uterine cancer , at each turn in the road I kept being steered in the wrong direction . // Just when my life had moved into a new place , I began to experience symptoms . When I say " moved into a new place , " I mean a place without Peter , my childhood sweetheart and husband for almost twenty years . // One of the hardest things , if not the hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For me it was like walking through fire , because I was never one to leave anything . I had trouble parting with our old ' 78 Buick , so leaving the person I 'd been with since I was fifteen seemed impossible . // We had a beautiful home , wonderful friends , and together had created our single greatest achievement to date , The Nanny . But I was miserable . When you achieve everything you 've ever dreamed of or wanted , and you 're still unhappy , the time has come to stop looking without and start looking within . I 'd agonized over this for years . // We 'd begun to fall apart after the night we became victims of a violent crime , years before . That night was the night that changed everything . Two men with guns broke into our home . They were brothers on a rampage . While one loaded our car with all our valuables , the other , who was out on parole , tied Peter up and raped both me and my girlfriend Judi , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // I do n't think we truly realized the impact that experience had on us , but in fact we were never the same again . If we were insecure about being apart from each other before the attack , afterward we were riddled with fears , suffocated by codependency . We imprisoned ourselves in our home , put bars on the windows and doors , purchased an elaborate security system , and could n't make a move without looking over our shoulders . We lived with a heightened sense of danger all the time . We could n't sit in our yard without the alarm 's remote panic button . For years we continued to ignite fear in each other . I envied Judi , who got to leave the scene of the crime and live among normal people who were n't scarred by what happened that night . // I remember one afternoon we were taking a walk , in Beverly Hills no less , when a car pulled up alongside us to park . Peter grabbed my arm and we began racing in the opposite direction , imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all they were doing was parking their car . Clearly , we were in trouble . And it was our marriage that paid the price . // It was n't all bad , though . We had great times , happy times , and a deeply committed friendship . But marrying your highschool sweetheart , as romantic a notion as that sounds , is probably not the best idea . We were too young , too inexperienced with life , and underdeveloped as individuals . Even though we were extremely compatible in our humor , ethics , food , and art , our greatest compatibility was in how we complemented each other 's neuroses. // He was a person of many needs and I needed to be needed . We both had a fear of being abandoned , and that kept each of us from leaving . I was completely out of touch with my own feelings , and he was consumed by his . We loved each other very much , he just had a lot of problems . And so did I. It was n't until I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And boy did I get an earful . // At the risk of sounding like a clich ? , I needed to find myself . I did n't know who I was as a separate person from Peter . I realized I was a woman who had no opinions apart from my husband 's , no identity outside of who I was in the relationship . I was completely codependent , incapable of buying a simple chair or garment without saying , " What do you think , honey ? " // I never knew how to apologize to anyone for anything . Not one of my more flattering traits . On The Nanny I obsessively tried to track the trains that would lead me to who was really at fault when something went wrong , because I never wanted to be blamed for anything . I was the same way in my marriage . // Working on The Nanny was , in itself , a monumental undertaking . But doing it while my marriage was falling apart was a killer . Even now , I 'm surprised Peter and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the show as our baby , and no matter how hard things became in our personal lives , we tried not to bring them to work . The show must go on . We never missed a day of work . We never shut the show down . And in many ways it was our savior . There remained a real need to be civil to each other even during the hardest of times . That 's not to say we never had fights backstage or screaming matches in our office , but they were n't the norm . Thank God . // Ya got ta understand , I never really wanted to leave Peter . I loved him , and he loved me . But I felt so trapped by my problems that despite my crippling fear of being alone , I left . It was after a terrible fight we had . I slept in the guest room . It was the last night I ever spent in our home . My dream house , I once called it . The next morning I checked into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become my own person , and get over my fears once and for all , I would n't be happy with him or anybody . The first night I slept in a bed without him , my body twitched and shook from fear . It was that difficult . // Much to my horror , within forty-eight hours word reached the press that we were separated and all hell broke loose . In the middle of the night I got a call from my publicist saying she 'd received a tip that the press knew where I was staying and that I had to get out . Reporters were also camped out on the front lawn of our house , where Peter was still living . It was a nightmare . I had never experienced anything like it . And needless to say , it exacerbated the situation tenfold . We were both so raw with pain , guilt , and regret , the last thing we needed was to be put under the tabloid spotlight . // Judi and my manager , Elaine , two of my best girlfriends whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the beach . Many people said the beach was very medicinal , and I needed all the medicinal I could get , so we all loaded into Elaine 's Cadillac and headed west . // That afternoon I found a little one-bedroom right on the ocean . Afterward , the three of us had lunch at a nearby cafe . I remember Judi gabbing a mile a minute about how cute I could make the place , while Elaine went on and on about what a find an apartment with a sunset view and two parking spaces was . But there I sat , practically comatose , nauseous and in shock , chewing on a tuna sandwich . What was I doing ? Letting myself out of the cage I 'd put myself into many years before , that 's what . So I did it , signed my name on the dotted line of a one-year lease . // It was far from what anyone would expect a famous sitcom star to live in , but for me it was perfect . I did n't want some large house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared me . I 'd never lived on my own before , not once in forty years . I wanted to be able to see all the rooms as soon as I walked through the front door . I was living my life backwards . At twenty , I 'd lived like a forty-year-old ; at forty I was living like I was twenty . // The apartment had a living room , a terrace , a fireplace , a little kitchen , a little bedroom , and a little bathroom . I turned the bedroom into an office/dressing room and put my bed in the living room with the fireplace , terrace , and view , more like a great hotel suite than an apartment . I decorated it sparingly with overstuffed , upholstered pieces in shades of white , and picked up a few casual antique tables and dressers. // That sounds easier than it was . I remember one night lying in bed with my dog , Chester , having an anxiety attack over a rocking chair I 'd bought from Shabby Chic . The fuss I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . It 's so strange how riddled with contradictions I was . During the day , an executive producer of a hit television show , but at night a weeping baby . // I must admit , though , I was proud of the way the place looked when I was finished decorating . I was living alone , without bars on my windows . No matter what I 'd achieved on The Nanny , being on my own in this tiny little apartment seemed my greatest accomplishment. // One step at a time . I was managing . Not easy , but definitely on the right path . Meanwhile , why was I experiencing strange bleeding and cramping in the middle of my cycle ? The first couple of times it happened , I chalked it up to stress , but now it was becoming a regular occurrence . Still , it was n't a lot of bleeding , and it was n't like it was happening every day or anything . All I needed was a simple panty liner and I could easily ignore it . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to call Doctor #1 , the gynecologist I 'd been seeing for years . // I sat in her examining room . As usual , I nervously dabbed a little Chanel No. 5 below my belly button . What ? It should n't be a pleasant experience for the doctor ? I glanced at the wall , which was covered with snapshots of all the babies my doctor had delivered . One kid in front of a Christmas tree had reindeer antlers on his head . The dog beside him wore a red suit and a beard like Santa . Well , I suppose it 's better than the butt shot on the bearskin rug from my day . // Doctor #1 eventually breezed in and snapped on her gloves . I slid down to the table 's edge , placing my heels in the stirrups . There was no mention of the perfume . I wondered if she was more a Shalimar gal . // I brought her up to date on my symptoms . " I keep experiencing this cramping in the middle of the month and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // " Do you take anything to help relieve the pain ? " she asked , while performing a relatively painless Pap smear . I knew there was a reason I preferred a female gynecologist . Small hands ! // " I usually take an Advil and the cramps subside , " I responded . // " Well , I would n't worry about anything a single Advil can take care of . " She did n't seem very concerned , which was a relief , but I thought she did seem a bit hyper . She talked a mile a minute as her head periodically popped up from behind the paper sheet that draped across my thighs . // She brought up the Chinese herbs I knew she was selling on the side to Judi and a few of my other girlfriends to help them lose weight . Oy . I never liked the idea that my gyno was into that , too . I should have known then . " I 've been taking them for two years now , " she said , while pressing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm afraid I 'll gain weight . " // " What do you make of my midmonth staining ? " I asked , while noticing on the wall a set of triplets dressed like bunnies . " You 're probably perimenopausal . It 's the precursor to menopause and a common symptom in middle-aged women . " Middlewhat ? " In France they consider it normal , " she added . // My mind wandered as I began to obsess on Catherine Deneuve . Catherine Deneuve is French and she looks great . Does Catherine Deneuve stain between periods ? Does Catherine Deneuve still get her period ? Did Catherine Deneuve get a face-lift ? // " Fran , what about having children ? " Doctor #1 said , pulling me back into the moment . " Do you plan to ? Because time is running out ! " By this point she was annoying me . My life was so up in the air I had no idea what I was having for breakfast , let alone what I was doing about having kids . But the photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball uniform sitting in a catcher 's mitt sure looked cute . // In that moment I made a mental note to stop seeing a gynecologist who was also an obstetrician . I mean , I needed this pressure like a hole in the head . So I pulled up my pants and left with a sample bag of Chinese weight-loss herbs and a clean bill of health . I had cancer at the time . // A Diagnosis // June 12 , 2000 // It seemed like any other day , but it was n't . I was getting dressed to work out . Leesa , my exercise instructor , was already upstairs waiting for me . My housekeepers , Ramon and Angelica , a dear couple from Guadalajara who have worked in my home for years , were cleaning in the kitchen . My dog , Chester , was asleep on the bed . Then the phone rang . It was my gynecologist calling . // " Oh , hi , " I said cheerfully . " I got the results back from your tests . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should talk in my office , but then I figured calling would be easier than having you drive in and then having to drive home again , " she rambled . I honestly did n't realize what she was getting at . // " It 's okay , " I told her , thinking I did n't want to drive in just to talk , either . // Then she said it . " You have adenocarcinoma . I 'm very surprised myself . " // " What 's that ? " I asked , still not really understanding . " Uterine cancer . " // I immediately burst into tears . She was saying I had cancer . Me . I got so scared . In that instant , my whole world came crashing down . // I 'm going to die . This is it . My legs got so weak I dropped onto the bed . I do n't want to die . I do n't want to be alone . But I was alone with the phone to my ear . This is n't me . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling this to . Me , me , and only me . They were my tests that showed these results . My body 's turned on me . It 's trying to destroy me . Dear God , why ? What did I do ? Did I do something to deserve this ? // Through my fears and tears the doctor got my attention . " Fran , it 's in a very early stage . And uterine cancer is very slow growing and much less invasive than other women 's cancers . " As she spoke , I wrote everything down . // Nothing seemed to be working in my brain . I could n't think , could n't cognize this horror . I did n't know what to do . I began to panic . On The Nanny , whenever the shit hit the fan I 'd wait a beat and then say , " Okay , here 's what we 're gon na do , " and a whole plan would unfold . People would come to me for answers . But right in that moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was lost , like when I was a little kid and got lost in a crowd on a busy street . I did n't know where I was or how I 'd get home . I could n't find my parents . I was frightened , so very frightened . Sitting there , I was that little girl all over again . // " What happens now ? " I asked . // " You 'll need surgery , at least a partial hysterectomy , " she answered . A hyster- WHAT ? Growing up , my mom talked about relatives who 'd had that surgery , and she said they were never the same after . That 's what was always said : " She was never the same . " // Oh my God , I do n't want to become some kind of a freak . Will I still feel like a woman ? Who will love me ? Will anybody love me ? A flood of questions ran through my head , but what came out were deep , guttural sobs . // " They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , that 's up to the surgeon , so I 've made you an appointment with a specialist . She 's on the board at Cedars , considered one of the best nationwide , and she 's very compassionate . " // My hand was shaking as I tried to write everything down . " When ? " I asked . " Friday . That 's when she sees new patients . " // This is only Monday , what do I do between now and then ? // Just the week before , my mother had undergone a D&amp;C for a polyp in her uterus and she was fine . No cancer , no hysterectomy , just a few snips on a benign growth as an outpatient and boom , good as new . That 's what I 'd been expecting , too . But she 'd passed her test and I 'd failed mine . // I have cancer ? This does n't make sense . I 'm the strong one , the healthy one . Good peasant stock , that 's what I 'm made of ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was in the cancer center at Cedars . Cancer center ? Where all those really sick people go ? // I suddenly thought about Peter , my ex-husband . The man I 'd been with since I was fifteen . For more than half my life we were together . Husband and wife , coworkers , codependent friends . Until recently . Just recently when it all came apart , ending in a divorce . All those years , we 'd trudged through thick and thin . // I remembered his parents , Pat and Eddie , both brought down in the prime of their lives by lung cancer . How they both went through chemo and radiation treatment . How they both suffered as their bodies slowly wasted away before they finally died . I do n't want to go that way . Dear God , I never want to go that way . // The doctor said to call her if I needed anything . " Even if it 's just for a hug , " she added . // I thanked her , but I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I did n't have cancer . She 'd sat in her office and said , " Fran , you do not have cancer . " Those were her exact words , and now all she could say to me was , " I 'm very surprised " ? // I hung up the phone feeling queasy . My stomach was in knots . If I 'd eaten breakfast I 'm sure I 'd have vomited right then . This was misery of Gothic proportions . That one call became the marker by which my entire life would be divided in two . Before cancer and after . //
