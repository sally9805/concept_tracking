// The living is easy-for morno zests than you could imagine-on Scaline 's si , , ift , new , feature-filled 37-foot family cruiser If a 37-footer could ever be called a yacht , it 's this one . Just look at what 's in it : Two staterooms , two heads , a functional galley , salon dining space for seven , sleeping for six , and a full flying bridge . There 's more : a pleasant aft deck , a big swim platform , seating for six up top and a queen-size sun pad for full-length leisure . All in 37 feet . Photograph BIG AND BRIGHT . The new F37 's all-glass , curved salon entrance lets in lots of light GATHER ROUND : Two club chairs increase the salon/dining seating capacity to seven . Photograph FOR THE COOL- A full , serviceable galley . // But can it boogie ? Well , if a steady 25 mph in closely stacked , four-foot seas all the way across the Gulf Stream is any indication , the answer is : definitely . We made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Sealine 's newest , a Euro-style cruiser that incorporates the British builder 's patented convex glass cabin entranceway and adjacent teak staircase , its innovative , overhead ( in the hardtop ) canopy storage and cockpit-table storage , as well as more family-friendly features than you 'd ever imagine could be packed into a boat this size . Sealine 's growth in the U.S. is a ' 90s success story . Its prospects for the new century are smashing . Give credit to the marketing acumen and customer service of the U.S. importer , Global Yachts in Miami , Fla . Global specializes in providing backup to its clients , offering dockage and maintenance for the boats it sells right outside its impressive Biscayne Bay office complex , now home to a variety of marine service providers . Just minutes from the Miami inlet , Global 's presence adjacent to the Biscayne Bay Marriott is such that the well-known marina ( in-water site of the Miami Boat Show ) is now called the Sealine Marina and Yachting Center . Without an eye-catching , sophisticated , seaworthy product , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell boats , no matter what marina they 're in . Global 's growth has been fueled by the enthusiasm of Sealine owners . The 30 to 50 foot cruiser market is loaded with choices . More and more people are choosing Sealines . After taking one to Bimini and back , it 's easy to see why . The deep-V hull that enables the new , straight-inboard 37 to maintain a brisk cruising speed in a turbulent Gulf Stream is born of building boats for Europeans who lack the vast bays and waterways that Americans are accustomed to . Cruising in Europe usually means taking on nasty offshore conditions-a mission that Sealines have been bred for . Crafted in England 's Cotswold region , where neighborhoods are works of art and nothing is out of place , the boats embody precision , fastidious workmanship and no-nonsense practicality . In other words , they 're really neat . Spend some time on one and you 'll see why Global 's owner , Jerry Berton , says , " They sell themselves . " One reason is that they 're designed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . The imaginative use of space that characterizes this compact , multi-level , family get-away boat is a Sealine trademark . The distortion-free , smoked-glass , curvilinear glass wall and sliding door that separate cabin and cockpit is a distinctive styling statement-as are the elliptical side windows . It sets Sealines apart from the pack . Yet , it 's eminently functional , providing additional floorspace in the salon , brightening the entire cabin and affording total visibility aft . Its frame is part of the one-piece deck/superstructure mold . So is the adjoining , similarly sloped staircase that provides such easy , attractive ( it has teak treads ) , safe access to the bridge . The extended overhang that shoots back from the bridge is an aggressive , yacht-inspired horizontal line , but it 's more than another strong design element . It provides shade in the cockpit ( with 64 " headroom ) , a sunlounge on the bridge , overhead lighting , and it houses both the cockpit enclosure curtains and cockpit table in patented overhead compartments-an idea a dozen other builders must wish they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , extra aft-dock seating , and a big bridge with a generous sunlounge all enlarge the F37. // Two more Sealine innovations actually make their debuts on the F37 . One is a clever fold-out cockpit bench that stores in the starboard side just ahead of the boarding step . It increases seating capacity in the cockpit to six-great for alfresco dining around the cockpit table , St. Tropez style . The cockpit itself has an attractive teak sole ( as does the bridge ) , an in-sole lazarette , a clear acrylic transom door and a stainless steel-lined , insulated compartment under the portside boarding step in which to keep ice and drinks . On the swim platform you 'll find a neatly concealed , 15-foot hot and cold shower hose , a builtin pedestal for a davit , a Glendinning Cablemaster shore cord retriever , a concealed swim ladder and a big wet-storage compartment for dive gear , etc . The second new Sealine invention is a swiveling helm bench that swings around 90 degrees so the back rests against the port side of the bridge , transforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dockside parties and evenings at anchor . It 's 10 feet off the water , so you ca n't fail to catch the breeze , whether you 're sitting around the cocktail table ( that stores in the helm bench base ) or gazing at the stars , stretched out on the commodious sunlounge , the cushions of which pop up to provide even more seating . Above the sunlounge is a forward-canted mast for antennas ( TV , radar , etc. ) another smooth marriage of form and function . One other bridge feature : a compartment for a nifty Sealine " Coolbag , " a soft-sided little 12volt cooler you can reach into for a cold one or take ashore in the dinghy . Interior magic That 's a lot of stuff for a 37 . It 's when you step inside , however , that you realize that boat designers are truly magicians , which goes double for the guys at Sealine . Boat reports are full of facts and figures , but here 's one that really captures the essence of this boat : There 's comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all of them can sit at a table , Seven can sit in the salon-five on the big U-shaped setee and two on the club chairs that slide under the portside desk/breakfast bar . Dinner for 17 would perhaps tax the galley , but its two-burner range , double SS sink , microwave and under-counter fridge ( plus additional freezer ) will serve a family well . The galley is " down , " but still very much in the salon mix . Another testament to what Sealine has wrought in 37 feet is that each of the two heads ( both with showers ) has two entrances . The guest cabin has twin berths with storage beneath which can be converted to a queen-size bed with filler cushions . The tasteful master stateroom , done in the colors of your choice with Italian ultrasuede and satin cherry woodwork , as is the entire interior , has room for a hanging locker , vanity cabinet and TV . Both the upper and lower helm stations are designed to house a full array of Raytheon electronics , including radar/plotter , autopilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and VHF , and have wood-grain steering wheels . Electronic controls are optional . A tilt wheel at the upper station allows stand-up operation . Win 330-hp Cummins diesels deliver a top speed of 33 knots and a cruising speed close to 30 . Yanmar and Volvo diesels are also available , as is gas power . But for those who plan to take advantage of the F37 's extended cruising capability and who enjoy being out on the water as often as possible , I 'd stick with the diesels . Driving the F37 is areal pleasure . It tracks well , staying on course without constant correction , and the helm ergonomics and driving position are excellent . The cockpit lazarette affords easy access to sea strainers , fuel filters , optional genset and AC equipment , pumps and steering gear . Its carpeted storage area is huge . All in all , Sealine 's new F37 , which replaces its existing 36-foot cruiser , is a real breakthrough in this size range . Its performance allows an owner to venture offshore in threatening weather without having to slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodations give a family of four , or two couples , a level of privacy usually found only in larger boats . And the amount of outdoor space for entertaining and relaxing is extraordinary . // Sealine F37 // <p>
