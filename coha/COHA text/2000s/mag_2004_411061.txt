Are astrophotographic colors real ? ; Axial tilt and climate ; Twinkle , twinkle // ARE ASTROPHOTOGRAPHIC COLORS REAL ? I thoroughly enjoy the colorful pictures in the magazine , but I have always wondered if the colors arc real or if they result from some sort of photo-processing ? Do we really see all those reds , blues , and greens looking through a telescope ? - MARK MISSEN , TORONTO , ONTARIO , CANADA Photograph THE CONE NEBULA 'S vivid colors are real - but film and CCDs have a big advantage over the eye when it comes to perceiving color : They can accumulate light over a long exposure . DANIEL PHILLIPS // The answer comes in two parts : Yes , the colors are real , and no , we usually do n't see them . Objects in space show us their true colors in several ways . For example , the planets of the solar system shine by reflecting sunlight . The creamy yellows and browns of Saturn , the blue of Neptune 's atmosphere , and the red rocks and soil on Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most strongly . Deeper in space , the most colorful objects are nebulae . A small percentage of these are reflection nebulae . As the name implies , these reflect light from nearby stars . Because they are made of gas and dust , these objects do n't just reflect the light , they also scatter it , which makes them appear bluish . The same thing happens on Earth : Sunlight scattered by our atmosphere colors the cloudless sky blue . Most visible nebulae are emission nebulae ( and , yes , there are combination emission/reflection nebulae ) . An emission nebula shines because hot stars within the cloud excite the atoms of gas ( raising them to a higher energy level ) . The gas then reemits the energy as colored light . So nebulae come in a variety of beautiful colors . But why do n't we see these vivid colors through telescopes ? The answer is that most objects are n't bright enough to trigger the color receptors in our eyes . Human vision comprises two types . Photopic vision is what we employ mainly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called just " color vision , " it involves the receptors in the eye known as cones . Scotopic vision operates under low illumination and involves the receptors called rods . For photopic vision to be triggered , the object must be reasonably bright - or a telescope must be large enough to show it as bright . Take star color , for example . Ninety-nine percent of all stars appear white . Why ? It 's not because all those stars are white . It 's because they 're not bright enough to trigger the cones in our eyes . Several bright stars do appear colored to the naked eye , however - orange Arcturus , blue Rigel , yellow Capella , red Betelgeuse , and others . More stars look colored through telescopes , which collect much more light than our eyes . The bigger the scope , the more colored stars it will show . Find Albireo , the head of Cygnus the Swan . By eye , this star appears white . But through even a small telescope , Albireo resolves into a pair of stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , the detectors used by astrophotographers have a big advantage over eyes . A film or CCD camera can collect light for seconds , minutes - even hours . Your eye is limited to a 1/30-second exposure . That is , the eye 's shutter opens and closes 30 times a second . This limitation allows only so much light into the eye at any one time , and it guarantees that cameras will record much greater detail and color . So enjoy the pictures ! - MICHAEL E. BAKICH , ASSOCIATE EDITOR AXIAL TILT AND CLIMATE Is the 23.5 tilt of Earth 's axis fixed ? Does the tilt change ? If so , how does this affect the climate - for instance , do polar regions get a more direct hit of the Sun 's energy ? - JOE PAZOUREK , MIDDLE RIVER , MARYLAND Basic earth science teaches us that the tilt of Earth 's rotation axis with respect to the Sun - which is properly known as the obliquity of the ecliptic - has a constant value close to 23.5 . But " constant " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a human lifetime . In fact , Earth 's obliquity varies as a result of small gravitational perturbations from the Sun and other planets . Fortunately , our massive Moon acts to keep this variation confined to a very small range : a little over 2 . The extreme values are about 22.1 and 24.5 during a cycle of about 41,000 years . Currently , the obliquity is decreasing by just under 0.4 arcseconds per year . Planetary scientists calculate that an increase or decrease of 1 in obliquity results in an increase or decrease of about 1 percent of the total solar heating in the hemisphere pointed toward the Sun at a given solstice . Photograph EARTH 'S MASSIVE MOON stabilizes the tilt of our planet 's rotation axis , helping to constrain climatic changes . Some biologists theorize that such stability was critical for the emergence of life . NASA/JPL // A far larger effect on the climate seems to be linked to long-term variations in the eccentricity of Earth 's orbit . This number is a ratio of the major axis of Earth 's elliptical orbit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can vary from 0.0005 ( very nearly circular ) to 0.0607 over a timescale of about 100,000 years . As eccentricity increases , the extreme distances of Earth from the Sun become more pronounced , with Earth being closer to the Sun at perihelion and more distant at aphelion . This changes the annual variations in temperature extremes at the solstices , and thus , it has a much greater effect on long-term climate changes . It is interesting to compare these figures with similar ones for Mars . The Red Planet orbits much closer to Jupiter , which exercises significant perturbations on the planet . Mars 's obliquity varies between about 15 and 35 , and its eccentricity ( currently 0.093 ) varies between near-circular and 0.14 . These two factors combine to give Mars great climatic variation - from an airless world whose atmosphere is frozen out onto the surface , to one of extreme seasons with violent atmospheric processes in constant turmoil as the seasons change . - GEOFF CHESTER , U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY TWINKLE , TWINKLE On a trip to the Grand Canyon , a companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car parked on the rim with a flashing red , blue , and white light . Then we saw that it was a bright star rising over the canyon 's edge . My friend identified it as Arcturus . What 's going on with this star that it produces such a brilliant light show ? - DAVID J. PIPPIN , KANSAS CITY , MISSOURI Actually , any star will show the same effect you saw , but it becomes very noticeable with bright stars such as Arcturus . Just before it reaches your eye , the light from the star passes through a highly distorting layer of Earth 's atmosphere , and this causes the starlight to flicker and change color from moment to moment . The distortion occurs because sunlight falls on the ground during the day and heats it . By night , the ground loses the heat by warming the layer of air above it . At both times , the warmth lowers the air 's density , changing how it bends light that passes through it . Moreover , the changes occur from one second to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - hence the flashing you saw . Dimmer stars usually do n't shine brightly enough for the naked eye to see flashes , but a look through binoculars or a telescope shows the effect clearly . - ROBERT BURNHAM , SENIOR EDITOR Author Affiliation MARK MISSEN , TORONTO , ONTARIO , CANADA Author Affiliation MICHAEL E.
