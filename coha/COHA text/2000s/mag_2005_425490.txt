Harvesting trees sustainably and reclaiming scrap lumber is a good business and a rewarding way of life . Photograph // My wife , Kathy , and I live and work on 47 forested acres in Moweaqua , Ill. , which we selectively and sustainably harvest . It 's just the kind of life I dreamed about when I was younger and used to go hunting with my dad . When I was growing up , the forest seemed like the most comfortable place in the world , and I knew it was where I wanted to live someday . I met Kathy 26 years ago when I was a single father raising two teenage boys , and her daughter was 5 years old . It still amazes me how quickly our lives blended together : We married three months after we met . At the time , we had little money , but Kathy shared my dream of living in the country , so we began searching for land . About two years later , Kathy came home from work one day and told me she had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the property , my heart jumped into my throat . It , was full of huge , old oak trees . There was also a nice house that we had come to see , so I walked through the front door to be polite . But I could n't help myself and walked straight out the back door and wandered through the timber . It was more than we could easily afford , but we both loved the place , so we bought it . BUILDING A BUSINESS Times were a bit tough at first , and it struck me that some of the dead or dying trees might be more valuable as building materials than as firewood . We made another leap of faith and purchased a Kasco sawmill , which we used to cut some logs for neighbors . The mill paid for itself within 90 days , and we realized there was enough demand to justify putting in a kiln for drying wood and a surfacing shop so that we could sell lumber . Once we had the mill going , I went to tree-service companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring us the trees and scrap wood they removed rather than paying to dump it all in a landfill . Within four years , we had built a retail store . Now we sell wood products all over the United States . More than 80 percent of the lumber we cut would have been buried in a landfill if we had n't reclaimed it . Dealing with so much scrap wood has its challenges . We sometimes hit nails , dog chains and even glass insulators when we 're cutting through the wood , but I consider it my responsibility to pull every square inch of useable lumber from every log . Some of these trees have stood for more than 200 years , providing shade and shelter for birds , squirrels and many other critters . These oxygen-producing machines spent their lives scrubbing pollutants out of the air , preventing erosion and helping to keep our waterways clean . Each tree can suck up hundreds of gallons of water a day . A lot of it flows out of the leaves , nature 's air-conditioning system . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remove trees that have become sick or have died , and occasionally those that prevent other trees from receiving sunlight . I am thankful to live among these trees , and when one dies or needs to be removed , it is an emotional experience .

A lot of the better-quality wood generally is found in the bottom log - or lowest section of the tree . As much as possible , we quarter saw the white oak butt logs , which raises the value of the lumber . Much of that is sold to people who make fine furniture . The second and third sections up the tree have more limbs , but we find good markets for that wood , too . We also make outdoor furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it does n't readily absorb moisture , and it is so rot resistant that wine and whiskey barrels are made from it . We make book-matched picnic tables from our lumber , which means the wood is cut so that the grain on each side of the table lines up as a mirror image of the other . The tables become a work of art by the time they 're finished . Some of the most unlikely looking trees yield the most beautiful wood . We cut curved limbs and use them for the graceful curving backs of benches ( see Page 95 ) , trellis tops and bed headboards . AT HOME IN THE FOREST One of our greatest joys is teaching children about sustainable forestry practices . Through the years , we have taken hundreds of school groups on tours of our property . We have fun showing children how the regeneration of a forest works , as trees grow from nuts to young seedlings , and on up to the teenagers of 2- to 3-inch trunks . We even stack up fallen branches to make homes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have done our job well , the students and teachers go home with a newfound appreciation for how a forest works . I am now 60 years old and busier than ever . My related jobs include selling sawmills , writing for hardwood industry magazines and addressing conferences on direct-marketing wood products . But I do have time for a serious hobby - I love classic cars and am fortunate enough to own a beautiful 1935 LaSaIIe coupe . Kathy is a fantastic gardener . She has taken some timbers I cut and built raised beds in the garden . She also put planer chips in the walkways between the beds . The garden produces asparagus and rhubarb in spring , grapes in August and much more . We sell most of the wood we cut and use any leftover wood scraps as firewood in the boiler that heats our home , but we also do a lot of bartering . We trade firewood for almost everything , which this past winter included some of the best free-range turkeys in the world . Even our planer chips go to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is satisfying to trade with neighbors just as our grandparents did , and making a living from the land brings us much entertainment and joy .
