Peter Krause is n't as attractive as people say . His jaw is too square ; his face is too long ; his upper lip sweats a bit . In 20 years , he will be great for a John Kerry biopic . But Krause 's face , at once Teutonic and boyish , is perfect for what directors ask it to do again and again : express agony . Krause , who has a new film out this week , a Broadway play that opened July 29 and a leading role in HBO 's Six Feet Under ( Sundays at 9 p.m. ) , is having the time of his life playing men who are in hell . <P> Consider the pageant of misery Krause has brought to life : in just three years , Six Feet Under 's Nate Fisher has lost both his father and his wife  --  whom he had to bury with his own hands to keep the evil mother-in-law from burning the corpse . In After the Fall , a revival of a 1964 Arthur Miller play and Krause 's first turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two marriages break under the weight of the first wife 's endless hectoring and the second 's endless pill popping . Along the way , two characters commit suicide . As Quentin asks at the end of the first act , " Good God , can there be more ? " <P> You bet . In We Do n't Live Here Anymore , Krause ( it 's Krau-zuh ) plays Hank Evans , a writer navigating his way through a convulsing marriage . The new film features partner swapping , late-night screaming and a child who sleeps in his own dried urine because the mother ( Laura Dern )  --  a woman with whom Evans has an affair  --  is so distracted by her gin and her suffering that she forgets to change the sheets . <P> When Krause and I met a few hours before After the Fall 's opening performance , I wondered how one actor channels so much pain without letting it sweep him away . How do you turn the emotional spigot on and off when pure bile is running through it ? Krause has two answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who grew up in Minnesota ( Krause turns 39 this week and has a 2 1/2-year-old son , Roman ) : " Sometimes I do what I do just because it 's my job . " And like any job , getting up at 4 a.m. to shoot a scene can require " the sheer will just to pick my bones up . " Krause is hot now , but he has actually had regular TV work for 14 years ( ever since 1990 , when he was on Carol Burnett 's sketch comedy Carol &; Company ) . <P> The other answer is that Krause believes his portrayals of laceration fulfill some moral obligation : " I think a lot of people are in agony , and if we only tell stories about ourselves that help us escape our lives , I do n't think I 'm doing my job . If you can be open about the agony and the anguish , maybe people can talk about it a little more freely and not be all alone . The less alone we all feel , the better off we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the actor as national counselor . Krause is at his worst when he philosophizes , which is often . He issues such impenetrable platitudes as , " Some people are hanging onto ' I 'm a Republican ' or ' It is Allah 's will . ' But they have to realize , it 's all just happening , and it 's all just consciousness . " Huh ?
