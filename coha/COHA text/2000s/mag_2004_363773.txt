If you think you 've heard every reason to get a wi-fi  --  equipped laptop , here 's a new one : live broadband Internet access on airplanes . This April , Lufthansa will begin to offer the wireless broadband service Connexion by Boeing on certain transatlantic flights . Other airlines are quickly moving to provide similar features . Both Scandinavian Airlines System and Japan Airlines will have in-flight broadband by the end of the year . <P> With Connexion , the whole plane becomes a wi-fi " hot spot , " linking users to the Internet via a network of satellites  --  without getting in the way of the airplane 's communications and navigation equipment . Users should be able to surf the Web , download attachments and upload pictures at speeds comparable to cable-broadband service . The cost will range from a flat $30 , for journeys around the globe , down to $10 for flights across continents .  --  By Wilson Rothman
