It may sound quite sensible to require Americans to show a photo ID before stepping into a voting booth . But as a growing number of states push to require such IDs , the move is drawing opposition from critics who see it as an effort to disenfranchise the poorest  --  and presumably most Democratic  --  voters . Five states today require a photo ID at the polls ( Florida , Hawaii , Louisiana , South Carolina and South Dakota ) , and seven more have considered such a requirement this year . In the past two weeks alone , photo-ID bills have been signed into law in Georgia and Indiana ; killed in committee in California ; and vetoed in Wisconsin by Governor Jim Doyle , a Democrat . Doyle insists the bill " has more to do with politics than ... with fraud . " In Georgia , G.O.P. Governor Sonny Perdue defended the new law : " Considering you must show a photo ID when cashing a check , renting a movie , getting on an airplane , I believe this is a reasonable requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones proposed in Arizona and Texas , must be approved by the Justice Department because of the history of voter discrimination in these states . Georgia 's law could be a tough sell : residents can fill in a provisional ballot without a photo ID but must return with one within 48 hours or the ballot wo n't be counted . " You may not be turned away , " says Tim Storey , elections analyst for the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures , " but whether your vote will be counted is another question . " <P> Representatives of the ACLU and several black caucuses say there 's no proof of voter fraud to justify these requirements . ID advocates counter that there is no proof of disenfranchisement either . Although an Ohio State University study predicts that 6% to 10% of qualified voters in that state could be turned away if a photo ID were demanded , no studies have yet been conducted to determine whether disenfranchisement has occurred in states where such ID is already required .  --  By Greg Fulton       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
