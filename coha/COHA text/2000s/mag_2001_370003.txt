With SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC behind bars in a 36-sq. - ft. windowless cell ( complete with squat toilet ) in downtown Belgrade , a former crony emerged as the man whose testimony put him there . MIHALJ KERTES was chief of Customs from 1994 to 2000 , placing him at the center of a criminal network that permeated the regime . It was through Kertes , investigators say , that as much as $4 billion in levies collected at Serbia 's borders was diverted to Milosevic . Now , say Milosevic 's lawyers , Kertes is telling all . To defend himself from that testimony , Milosevic said the stolen funds were not for personal gain but to arm Serbian rebels in Croatia and Bosnia . But that admission , the first ever , was welcomed by U.N . war-crimes prosecutors trying to document Belgrade 's role in fomenting the Bosnian war . Kertes is under heavy police guard in an undisclosed location and reportedly near nervous collapse for fear that one of his erstwhile friends might somehow track him down . <P>  --  By Andrew Purvis .
