Section : MUSCLE It 's never been easier to get from where you are to where you want to be <p> A lot of men know just enough about the rules of fitness to be scared away from starting a workout routine . No pain , no gain ? No thanks . But that 's why we prefer to do our rulebreaking in the gym , where it does the most good . The latest stuff coming down from the physiology labs and exercise eggheads shows that you can make big gains with a relatively small investment of pain and time . If the old rules have left you fat and tired , it s time for some new rules . For a new you . CHANGE YOUR BODY BY CHANGING SPEEDS <p> Simply running faster for a minute , then going a little slower for a minute , helps you lose weight faster than moving at a steady pace , according to a 2001 study in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise . After 10 weeks , those who changed speeds lost more weight and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> FOLLOW THE RULE : Gradually increase your running speed to one you think you can maintain for 20 minutes or so . Go slightly faster than that pace for a minute , then run a minute at a slightly slower speed . Continue for about 20 minutes , then cool down for 5 minutes . In no time you 'll be donating pants to the Home for Middle-Aged Fat Runners . 20 MINUTES , TWICE A WEEK <p> That 's all it takes for a major health upgrade , says Bert Jacobson , Ph.D. , an exercise researcher at Oklahoma State University . Jacobson examined the absentee records of 79,000 workers and found that those who did a little exercise had fewer sick days than inactive guys . And here 's the really cool part : The twice-weekly exercisers saw the same health gains as those who worked out a lot more . " You do n't have to bust your butt to get benefits , " Jacobson says . <p> FOLLOW THE RULE : If you 're not exercising at all , schedule two brisk 20-minute walks a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same results with 10-minute chunks of exercise as you can with longer sessions . Just keep the total exercise time the same . IF YOU HATE TO JOG , DO N'T <p> Despite the benefits of aerobic exercise , you can reach the same goals through weight lifting and a healthy diet , with a few added dividends : bigger , stronger muscles and bones , a faster metabolism , less fat . In fact , a new study at the University of Wisconsin at La Crosse found that a single session of heavy lifting can increase a man 's metabolism for the next 48 hours . ( Following moderate aerobic exercise , metabolism goes back to normal after half an hour . ) <p> FOLLOW THE RULE : Try strength training with limited rest between sets , which will improve endurance . If you want a fat-burning boost in metabolism , use the exercises that work the most muscle ( squats , deadlifts , pullups , rows , and chest and shoulder presses ) and rest about 2 minutes between sets . WEAK ABS CAN KILL YOU <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 13 years of the study , those with the weakest abdominal muscles had more than two times the death rate of those with the strongest midsections . Our theory : A man who has his abs in balance has won the blubber war . There is no surer ticket to living long enough to enjoy that 401(k) . <p> FOLLOW THE RULE : A study at Springfield College in Massachusetts found that athletes who did abdominal and lower-back exercises on an exercise ball had much better midsection strength and overall balance than those who did crunches and back extensions on the floor . In other words , get on the ball . THE HARDER YOU GO . THE HARDER YOU GET <p> You can attain great health benefits and lose weight without pushing yourself particularly hard . But if you crank it up a notch  --  turning those brisk walks into slow jogs  --  your body compensates by using more fat for energy in the hours afterward , according to a new study at East Tennessee State University . " As intensity increases , your body shifts to using more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who conducted the study of men in their mid-20s . <p> FOLLOW THE RULE : The men in the study worked at 60 percent of their maximum aerobic capacity and burned 720 calories in the workout . You can tell you 've reached 60 percent of your maximum when you 're breathing steadily and deeply . You should be able to speak during these workouts , as long as you keep your comments brief . To burn 720 calories in a workout , a 180-pound man would need to jog for 53 minutes at a 10-minute-per-mile pace . LIFT FREE OR DIE <p> The easiest strength exercises  --  the ones you perform on machines  --  involve movements that do n't translate directly to real-life activities . A study at Georgia State University put older adults on a 2-year strength-training program using exercise machines . The seniors improved their strength an average of 34 percent in the 2 years , but their measures of physical function actually declined 3.5 percent . Over the long haul , machine exercise produces diminishing returns . <p> FOLLOW THE RULE : If you 're currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and balance . Try these functional moves , suggested by Juan Carlos Santana , C.S.C.S. , owner of the Institute of Human Performance in Boca Raton , Florida . TABLE 4 OLD RULES THAT STILL WORK NO SINGLE PROGRAM WORKS FOR EVERYONE ALL THE TIME . <p> " There are a million experts out there , but no one has the fail-safe recipe that works 100 percent of the time , " says Michael Mejia , C.S.C.S. , exercise consultant to Men 's Health . The best programs are a mix of styles and philosophies , and anyone who insists there 's only one true path to exercise enlightenment  --  whether it 's Tae Bo or Super Slow  --  is just plain wrong . <p> " On any new program , you 'll make gains during your first month or two , " says Mejia . " You just have to remember that nothing works forever . You have to expose your body to new methods , and that 's how you keep making gains . " IMPROVEMENTS MUST BE INCREMENTAL . <p> Many new or returning exercisers suffer from Superman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out the next week and run 6 days . Or , for their second workout , they double the weights they used in their first . Soon they 're felled by chronic injuries . <p> " The development of tendon and ligament strength lags behind the development of muscle strength , " says Avery Faigenbaum , Ed.D , C.S.C.S. , an exercise scientist at the University of Massachusetts . So your muscles may be strong enough to lift a weight or push you through a run , but your connective tissues may not be ready . <p> Faigenbaum stresses the 10 percent rule : Never increase volume , weight , distance , speed , or any other variable more than 10 percent a week . Ignore the rule and you decrease activity to a big , fat zero . FORM COMES FIRST . <p> No matter what type of exercise you 're doing , perfect technique is the key to safety and efficiency . " Especially as you grow older , you have to pay more attention to your form . When you get hurt , your injuries take longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exercise researcher at the University of Indiana . He recommends an occasional tune-up session with a trainer or coach , no matter how long you 've been working out . <p> In fact , a recent study at Ball State University found that men who worked out with personal trainers had bigger boosts in testosterone than those who worked out unsupervised . In other words , you just think asking someone for help makes you a weenie . It actually turns you into a sex machine . THE MORE YOU WANT , THE HARDER YOU HAVE TO WORK . <p> Sorry , but there is no safe , easy , fast , foolproof way to get in shape for a marathon , lose 4 inches around your waist , or build biceps like softballs . Those who do the work , and do it the right way , reap the most rewards . <p> By Lou Schuler <p>
