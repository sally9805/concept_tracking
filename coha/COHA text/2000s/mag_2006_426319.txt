Surrounded by cherished collections of books , illustrator and author Lane Smith and graphic designer Molly Leach begin a new chapter in a restored 200-year-old Connecticut farmhouse // Although they grew up in Oklahoma and Illinois respectively , Lane Smith and Molly Leach never considered themselves country types . City living seemed to be more their style , a fate that eventually brought each of them to New York City , where they met and later married . " Urban areas always felt more stimulating , " reflects Lane , an illustrator and children's-book author . But 10 years ago their outlook changed . The catalyst , explains Molly , a graphic designer , was a weekend getaway . " I read about an inn in Washington , Conn. , called ' The Mayflower Inn , ' " she says . " It sounded so charming that we decided to visit , but neither of us ever thought that the trip would alter our outlook on city living . " But alter their outlook it did . Soon after , the couple began spending summers in the Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmhouse with a small barn on five wooded acres . " The place was picture perfect , " Lane says . Transforming the 19th-century farmhouse into their home was easy , recalls Molly . It had previously been restored , so the couple had only to add some fresh paint and landscaping . However , the barn , which the couple intended to use as an art studio and guest space , was a mess , requiring extensive work . " It had a dirt floor , ancient plumbing , and a roof that leaked , " says Lane . " In the end , we tore down what was there and rebuilt on the existing foundation . " Eventually , the renovations not only resulted in a beautiful retreat , they also sparked a book by Lane . Titled The Happy Hocky Family Moves to the Country ! , the book relates the trials and tribulations of a city family who , like Lane and Molly , buy an old house and relocate to the country . " They not only experience the joys of renovating , they also encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renegade squirrels and rabbits , " says Lane of his fictional family . " Fiction , " observes Molly , " is sometimes not far from reality . " Sidebar OPPOSITE : To give the capacious first-floor living space of their new barn an aged appearance , husband and wife Lane Smith and Molly Leach had all of the door and window trim , as well as the towering built-in bookcases , made from reclaimed antique floorboards . ABOVE : Built in the early 1800s , the main house has a classic , Federal-style appearance . " When I look out the window of my studio , I see rolling green fields . The view could n't be more inspiring . " Sidebar LEFT , TOP TO BOTTOM : Illustrator and author Lane Smith reviews pages from previously published works in his studio . The book that was inspired by Lane and Molly 's move to Washington Depot . Conn. , The Happy Hocky Family Moves to the Country ! On the first floor of the barn , floor-to-ceiling bookcases contain Lane 's collection of vintage children 's books . OPPOSITE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane and Molly furnished the living room with overstuffed Edwardian chairs upholstered with Kilim rugs . " We wanted a house with character and that 's exactly what we got , " say Lane and Molly of their 19th-century farm-house . The ceilings may be only seven feet tall and all of the floors may not be level , but that 's part of the charm . " ABOVE LEFT : Because the main house encompasses barely 2.000 square feet of living space , Molly wanted to keep furnishings to a minimum and so did away with window treatments altogether . " The rooms are small , " she says . " I wanted them to feel light and airy . " Lane purchased the grandfather clock as a birthday present for Molly . That the clock ended up in the dining room rather than the front hall was a fluke . " It was the only room in the house with a ceiling high enough to accommodate the clock , " says Lane . The dining table was crafted from old floorboards . ABOVE CENTER : Although the kitchen cabinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's the details , such as the iron hinges , that give them a period look , " says Lane . Folk art , such as the Statue of Liberty painting by New York street artist Bertha Halozan , adds a whimsical touch . Another design trick : false beams made from aged wood . ABOVE RIGHT : Pretzel , one of the couple 's two cats , hangs out in the sunny living room of the main house . Built-in shelves contain the overflow of books from the barn . Molly covered the sofa in a lighthearted animal-themed fabric . " This is the country , " she says , " and I wanted to have fun with the furnishings . " Slipcovers and antique pieces , such as the writing desk by the window , lend the room a casual , lived-in appearance . " White paint works wonders in small spaces , but too much can leave a room feeling sterile . Add a second color , and instantly things become more interesting . " OPPOSITE : Soft green walls and a white-painted floor give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed 19th-century pressed leaves and flowers substitute for a traditional headboard . " The room was simply too small , " says Molly , noting that the home 's previous owners had lofted the ceiling in an effort to make the space feel larger . ABOVE LEFT : To brighten the path to the second floor of the farmhouse , Molly painted the stairs a cheerful shade of red . ABOVE RIGHT : Built-in furniture helps maximize space in a small secondfloor guest bedroom . Pale walls were a necessity , says Molly , given the room 's small size , but she tempered them with colorful linens. // <p>
