<p> On most nights , the Russian Samovar , a dimly lighted restaurant at the edge of the theater district in Midtown Manhattan , is a gloomy blend of new Russian money and faded emigre glamour . <p> But recently its upstairs dining room was haunted by ghosts from the 1920s and ' 30s , the golden age of the Soviet avant-garde . The grandson of the Constructivist architect Moisei Ginzburg stood in a corner chatting with the daughter of Alexei Dushkin , who once designed subway stations for Stalin . A few steps away , the daughter of the Soviet planner Nikolai Miliutin sipped cranberry vodka with Barry Bergdoll , the Museum of Modern Art 's top architecture curator . <p> They were all there for a symposium dinner related to " Lost Vanguard : Soviet Modernist Architecture , 1922-32 , " a show of recent photographs by Richard Pare at the Modern that conveys the fragile state of so many architectural monuments built in that heady era . <p> Yet the buzz in the room had less to do with Russia 's architectural heritage than with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Sergey Gordeev , a 34-year-old billionaire developer and Russian senator who helped finance the show at the Modern . <p> Two years ago , Mr. Gordeev bought a share of the Melnikov House ( 1927 ) in Moscow , setting off a panic in the city 's small but tightly knit preservation community . With its cylindrical interlocking forms , a hypnotic blend of Modernist purity and Russian mysticism , the house is considered a landmark of Soviet architecture . Yet it stands on valuable land in the city center . <p> Preservationists feared that Mr. Gordeev , who made his money in the rough-and-tumble Russian real estate market , might bulldoze the house to make way for the kind of gaudy new development that has become emblematic of the new Russia . <p> Today , the Melnikov House not only survives but also seems destined to become a museum . And that is mostly , if not all , due to Mr. Gordeev , who has emerged as a white-knight protector of Soviet architecture . <p> Last year he also bought the Burevestnik Factory Workers Club , another revered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded the Russian Avant-Garde Foundation , whose mandate includes fostering innovative new architecture and publishing books on Russian architecture as well as protecting and restoring Soviet-era landmarks . <p> He recently bought the archives of the architects Ivan Leonidov and Alexei Shchusev , and he plans to make the material available to scholars . He has introduced legislation in the Russian Parliament that would require the removal of advertising billboards from the city 's architectural landmarks . ( The bill was recently approved by the upper chamber and is now in the lower chamber . ) <p> " He 's polished up his image , " said Mr. Pare , who is negotiating to sell an archive of about 10,000 negatives to Mr. Gordeev . " He 's evolved from this shadowy figure to saint overnight . " <p> With his fingers in so many pies , it can seem as though Mr. Gordeev 's hands hold the fate of one of the greatest legacies of 20th-century Modernism . And while the preservationists who once feared him now fervently praise him , they privately admit to some disquiet . <p> Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wider playing field : New York 's cultural institutions . He donated heavily to the Guggenheim Museum last year . And when the Modern was short of financing for the Vanguard show , it was Mr. Gordeev who wrote the check . ( That Thomas Krens , director of the Guggenheim Foundation , showed up at a Modern dinner only reinforced a perception that New York institutions are in thrall to Mr. Gordeev , or at least his easy way with donations . ) <p> When Mr. Gordeev finally arrived at the Samovar , he slipped into the crowd as quietly as a cat . A slim , well-built man with windswept hair and piercing blue eyes , he was the picture of casual wealth in his tailored gray suit and open-collared shirt , . Although 34 , he looks younger , like a skateboarder who had to dress up for a dinner with the grown-ups . <p> Leaning against a wall near a Russian-style buffet , he chatted enthusiastically about the symposium , where he had spoken that day about his foundation 's mission . He said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , which he plans to transform into a museum , " like Le Corbusier 's Villa Savoye or Sir John Soane 's house in London . " <p> " I 've already spent $4 million on the Melnikov House , " he added . " I really think to do preservation in the proper way  --  government does n't have the money for that . I like the situation in America , where preservation has the support of private institutions . This is the right model for Russia , where there are a lot of rich people . " <p> Yet the next day , over a drink at a Midtown hotel , he seemed warier . <p> Asked how he had become interested in architecture , Mr. Gordeev was slightly vague . After the borders with the West opened up in the early 1990s , he said , he spent two years drifting around Europe , where he said he fell in love with Gothic churches . <p> " It is when I first discovered architecture , " he said . He did not elaborate further . <p> Questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Moscow , where his father was a weapons engineer and his mother a biochemist . <p> Mr. Gordeev added that he was slightly uncomfortable with the amount of attention he had drawn for his preservationist activity . " The real start in preservation in Moscow was organizations like MAPS "  --  the Moscow Architecture Preservation Society , founded in 2004  --  " foreign preservationists who came to Moscow , and people like Dushkina , who sounded the alarm , " he said . ( He was referring to Dushkin 's daughter Irina . ) " They are volunteers , activists , who are not getting any money . " <p> While he is quick to share credit with them , many of Mr. Gordeev 's preservationist colleagues fret over whether he will stay the course or is simply using their cause to raise his international reputation . His growing cultural profile serves him well in the Russian political establishment , given that President Vladimir V. Putin 's Kremlin is intent on polishing its own image in the West . <p> Mr. Gordeev 's critics note that the man he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not an architectural historian but a former public relations agent for business tycoons including Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the Russian oil magnate who was jailed for fraud and tax evasion . <p> And the Burevestnik workers ' club that Mr. Gordeev has promised to preserve is just across the street from a Soviet-era factory that his company plans to tear down to make way for a new business and convention center , stirring speculation that his cultural and business interests are somehow entwined . ( Mr. Gordeev said that as a senator , he is no longer involved in his company 's daily operations and was unaware of the deal . ) <p> Yet his preservationist activity so far seems dogged . After leaving New York , he passed through London , where he played host to a meeting of architectural historians to lay the groundwork for his Melnikov House museum . And he recently approached Frank Gehry about designing something for the Russian city of Perm . <p> One could argue that in embracing the arts , Mr. Gordeev echoes a long American tradition . Tycoons here have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet it took two generations for , say , the Rockefellers to amass their money and transform it into something of cultural value . <p> Mr. Gordeev is seeking to transform himself from brash capitalist to cultural philanthropist in little more than a decade . What is more , the pell-mell natureof development in Russia makes its architectural legacy particularly vulnerable . For this reason alone , his journey is worth watching . <p> " Why are Americans afraid of Russians ? " he asked . " Because they are unclear of their intentions . " <p> " These are good changes happening in Russia , " he continued . " I am just a part of it . We all want this heritage to survive , to be accessible to everybody . We need to be part of the world to do this right . " <p>
