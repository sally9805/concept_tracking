Patty Colebank , the doyenne of the Thinkin ' Ink tattoo parlor in Morgantown , W.Va. , might be called the Picasso of the Appalachians if she did n't have a first-rate handle already , right there on her business card : the Mistress of Pain . In 16 years the Mistress has tattooed all manner of luminaries ( future NFL players , Olympians , porn stars ) and all manner of body parts ( " eyelids , penises , bottoms of feet " ) , yet she has never had a regular customer quite like West Virginia 's resident folk hero , Mountaineers senior center Kevin Pittsnogle . ? " He 's the most laid-back popular person I 've met , " says Colebank , who has created three of Pittsnogle 's half-dozen tats and ( at his urging ) two for his mother , Tammy . Last week Pittsnogle and his wife , Heather , paid the Mistress a visit to go over plans for her next masterwork : a baby boy surrounded by angel wings sitting on a cloud bearing the name Kwynsie James Pittsnogle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day now , first in the hospital and then on Dad 's right forearm . " We ca n't wait to be parents , " Kevin says , and after three baby showers their two-bedroom apartment is ready . " The best gift we 've gotten is the Diaper Genie -- you put the diapers in it so they do n't stink up the whole house . " ? A year after Pittsnogle saw his name turned into a verb and came within a game of the Final Four , the Mountaineers are in no danger of stinking up their house , to say nothing of hostile arenas . Last Saturday 's 60-56 win at No. 17 UCLA gave No. 9 West Virginia ( 14-3 ) its 12th straight victory , a streak that includes road takedowns of No. 6 Villanova and No. 24 Oklahoma . Through Sunday the Mountaineers were second in the nation in three-pointers per game ( 11.2 ) , not least because their goateed marksman is dropping 2.2 treys a game -- a remarkable number for a big man . // " We have never played anybody like him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaging 19.8 points and 6.4 rebounds . " He 's a two guard who grew to 6 ' 11 " . They hardly ever post him up , and he 's always open because it 's foreign for big guys to go out and cover him . " // " What separates him is his quick release , " says West Virginia coach John Beilein . " I want to get a stopwatch and measure the time from when the passer releases the ball to when his shot hits the goal . " // After removing his distinctive name from last year 's NBA draft -- he would have been a second-round pick at best -- Pittsnogle has shed 27 pounds since October and now weighs a svelte 248 . His draft stock has risen as his weight has dropped , with one NBA Western Conference scout projecting him as a late first-round or early second-round pick . " He shoots like a 6-footer , " says the scout . " He 'll never be an explosive inside player , but that 's O.K. because he 's so highly skilled at what he does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W.Va . ) High , Pittsnogle got teased so much that he asked his mother if he could use her maiden name ( Shepherd ) . " Now I say , ' See what Pittsnogle got you ! ' " roars Tammy , who wears a momma pitts jersey to games and is so loud that she was once reproached by a Big East referee . // As the team 's only West Virginia native on scholarship , Pittsnogle has spawned a cottage industry cashing in on his appeal . The phrase You 've Been Pittsnogled ! has appeared on T-shirts , socks and underwear , and no jersey has been more popular at the Mountaineers team store than his number 34 ( which was sold out again last week ) . " It 's even outsold the Jerry West jersey , " says shop manager Chuck Phares , referring to the school 's greatest player . " People ask , ' Do you have any fake Kevin Pittsnogle tattoos ? ' " // Pittsnogle 's appeal is rooted in his hardscrabble mining-country background . He grew up in a trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon dribbling in favor of shooting all the time . His mom , Tammy , dropped out of high school and married his father , Kevin Sr. , when she was 18 . And Junior ( as Kevin 's mother calls him ) can be a one-man Dukes of Hazzard episode -- he 's had his license suspended twice for speeding in his 1995 light-blue Oldsmobile Aurora with 20-inch rims. // But , as is usually the case , this story does n't fit all the stereotypes . The Pheasant Ridge Trailer Park ? " It was n't high class , but it was nice , " says Pittsnogle , who moved with his family into a three-bedroom house at age 10 . His dropout parents ? Tammy got her GED and works as a home-care coordinator at a senior center , while Kevin Sr. is a supervising mechanic at a waste-management company where he 's been employed for the past 26 years . " They 've worked so hard , " says their only son . " I always looked to my dad and said , If he can do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time . " // Those are n't the only surprising facts about Pittsnogle . He graduated in December -- a semester ahead of schedule , thanks to summer school -- becoming the first member of his family to earn a four-year degree . ( He had a 3.1 GPA with a major in athletic-coaching education and a minor in history and has entered the master 's program in athletic coaching education this semester . ) He 's also a fantastic bowler who once rolled a 296 . After he 's done with basketball , he wants to become a history teacher and satisfy his longtime curiosity about the Holocaust by visiting Auschwitz . " I 've been to the Holocaust Museum in D.C. , " he says , " and I figure it would be powerful to see Auschwitz too . " // As for his driving , well , consider him guilty as charged . Pittsnogle 's older sister , Erika Blaylock , remembers the time in high school when Kevin , then 15 , jumped into the driver 's seat of her future husband 's car . " Kevin floored it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Blaylock says . " He jumped out of the car and said , ' Man , when I screw up , I really screw up . ' " Then there was the time last summer when teammates Mike Gansey and Patrick Beilein took Pittsnogle to play golf for the first time . " My ball was on the green , so I drove my cart right up next to it , " says Pittsnogle . " Everyone starts yelling , ' You ca n't do that ! ' " Pittsnogle shrugged , sank his putt and only then moved his cart . // While Pittsnogle is proud of his West Virginia heritage , he has a delightful sense of humor about his homespun tastes . Take his October 2004 wedding , which was held in the Martinsburg High auditorium . " You know how some receptions have fancy hors d'oeuvres ? " says Pittsnogle . " Well , we had corn dogs and pizza . We wanted stuff that people would really eat . Then we had some dancing and karaoke . It was a lot of fun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . A month before their wedding , Heather had a miscarriage . " The doctors tell you not to worry about it , that women have them all the time , but I took it hard , " she says . " Kevin did what he could trying to make me feel better . " Soon afterward , he got a tattoo on his right calf honoring their lost child . " It was real hard to deal with , but Coach Beilein was like a father figure for us , " says Kevin . " Now he wants to know every day what 's going on with Heather 's pregnancy . He seems as excited as we are . " // The team has already secured NCAA approval to fly Kevin back from a road trip if he 's away when Heather goes into labor , which could happen any time now : She started having contractions in early January . // Instead of handing out cigars , Kevin plans on celebrating at the Thinkin ' Ink .
