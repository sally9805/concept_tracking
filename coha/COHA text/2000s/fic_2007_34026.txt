Chapter One A Taste The story of my life . . . While it 's not so spectacular to me , when compared to the average person , I guess it is rather unique . Like all little girls , I played with my dolls , rode my bike , and cried for my mommy when I skinned my knee . But somewhere along the way those similarities began to change and I became different from my peers . I think it all started with my insatiable desire to be someone special , someone famous , and my craving to be loved . And if you ask anybody who knows , craving to be loved is dangerous because you are willing to compromise everything else you may desire to attain it . Like many young people , at age eighteen I thought I knew it all , including the specific direction in which I wanted my life to go , and I thought I knew everything I needed to know to get there . Nobody could tell me a damn thing . Not even my mother . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the fastest road to accomplish anything , never mind achieving stardom . And while my mom was relentless in her attempts to redirect my course , what she soon realized was that I was just as relentless in my passion to make it all the way to the top in the easiest and least time-consuming way possible.Unfortunately for me , tired from struggling , working , and probably just life itself , Mom eventually threw her hands up in the air and let me do my own thing , after warning me that I would have to learn the hard way . A single , divorced mother of two , Francine Young worked three jobs to provide for my older sister , Regina , and me and to maintain the three-bedroom house left to her by our grandmother . When her marriage to our father was coming to an end , Mom decided that it was time for Dad to go , but it took everything out of her to maintain the lifestyle that we were used to living . Between paying for dance classes for me and living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of owning her own hair salon in an effort to make ends meet and take care of us . Sometimes she was gone sixteen hours a day , seven days a week , which obviously did n't leave much time for her to spend with us . So we were pretty much forced to raise ourselves . By the time I 'd turned thirteen , I began finding it difficult to focus . As puberty took over , I started feeling emotions and desires I had never felt before , and things like ballet class were no longer at the top of my priority list . Besides , since Mom was always working , it was up to me to get myself to class , and the streets were starting to call my name-loudly . I wanted to see what they had to offer . Ballet , music , and art just were n't as exciting as the local weed spot , and I eventually stopped going to class . When Mom caught wind of all my absences , relieved not to have to pay the bill anymore , she simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to trouble , because anybody who knows can tell you that boredom , lack of focus , and puberty are the three ingredients that make the most troublesome stew . With our dad MIA and Mom gone most of the time , Regina and I knew this recipe all too well . I started getting into trouble and doing plenty of shit I knew was wrong . Right around this time , hip-hop was born and I quickly became mesmerized by the culture . Rapping and graffiti art was far more interesting to me than anything I was learning in a classroom , and cutting school became my favorite pastime . Since drawing was one of my passions , when I met Ding , one of the best graffiti taggers in my neighborhood , I would do any and everything to be around him . With his adventurous spirit , he quickly became my idol , and he was more than willing to teach me the art of tagging . The adrenaline rush I would get when we 'd jump down onto the tracks in the subway station was indescribable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permeated the dark , rat-infested tunnels made for a wild and creepy danger-filled experience . The police were also always on our heels , ready to arrest us for defacing New York City property , which made the thrill that much more exciting . I always knew that we had to get in and out quickly or risk being caught and jailed or worse-turned over to my mother . Still , on any given school-day afternoon , Ding and I would run through those scary tunnels to the train yard , where we 'd find paradise . Clean , vacant trains seemed to rest there , just waiting to be tagged , and we happily obliged . My name was Tasty and I carried a knapsack filled to the brim with every color spray paint you could imagine , and the bulk of it sometimes made it difficult to run . On one occasion , I was forced to drop my bag as I heard the weighty footsteps of the cops approaching in the darkness . Ding went one way while I went another , knowing that if we separated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save my own ass , I made the split-second decision to jump over the third rail onto the platform where I then ran up the stairs as if my life depended on it-which in a way it did . As I arrived on the uptown side , a D train was about to leave the station . In the nick of time , I forcefully thrust through the closing doors and dropped , panting , into a seat . When I looked up , all eyes were on my paint-covered face and clothes . But I was safe . I do n't remember what happened to Ding that day ; the only thing I cared about was that I had won the game . When I was n't cutting school and tagging my name all over the city , my other beloved pastime was hanging with my homegirls . They were my homies from around the way . We probably got along so well because we had much in common . It was like the blind leading the blind . They were pretty much in the same boat I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on crack , Ebony had no choice but to live with her eighty-year-old grandmother , who did her best but who was definitely no match for this overly boy-crazy teen with low self-esteem and raging hormones . Jessie , on the other hand , lived with her mother , but Ms. Faye always found her much younger boyfriends far more interesting than her teenage daughter . Then there was my girl Carmen , who I 'd met when I was fifteen during a ninety-day stint I was forced to do at the St. Rose Catholic Reform School after my mom got tired of reporting me to the cops for truancy . Now , Carmen was a ride-or-die chick to the bone-a five-foot-seven Puerto Rican beauty with pretty almond-shaped eyes and thick black lashes to complement them . Sexually frisky and mischievous , Carmen was known as the hot , freak-me-all-week girl , with long black curly hair that bounced seductively around her angelic face-a misleading feature since she was really a devil in disguise . Carm had perfected the art of using her assets to entice what she wanted out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women lusted after the juiciness she had to offer . Just a few months from completing her sentence when I met her , she was in for being a chronic runaway . While on the surface it looked like she simply did n't want to abide by her mother 's rules , she secretly told me that her stepfather had been molesting her since the age of eight , and on her thirteenth birthday she 'd finally gotten the balls to take flight . She 'd run away so many times that the local cops knew her by name . But each time they 'd catch her and bring her home , the abuse would start all over again . Within days , she 'd run again . By the time Carm turned fifteen , her mom had grown tired of having her brought home by the police and signed the papers for her to be admitted to St. Rose 's . She refused to believe Carm 's story about the molestation and just wanted her daughter out of her hair . St. Rose 's was the easiest solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a way , she ran St. Rose 's , garnering respect from the kids and adults alike . It was rumored that she possessed this incredibly freaky and promiscuous side , but truth be told , I never saw it . She got good grades and nobody fucked with her , and I wanted to align myself with that . Sure , her life was a never-ending saga , but my girl was a master at making the sweetest lemonade out of the most sour lemons . Connected through our dreams of becoming famous , Carmen and I became fast friends , watching each other 's back and helping each other get through our stint any way we could . Since my own sister and I did n't see eye to eye on too many things , I was elated to have some sister/friends who I could count on and call my own . They gave me the feeling that I belonged somewhere , because while I loved my older sister dearly , she was just too weak for me . Whenever I looked at her , I promised myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we both started out with big dreams , Regina had given up all her power to a guy whose sole purpose in life was to use and abuse her . I , on the other hand , was determined to make my own happiness and my own money , and to maintain my own power . I had my own opinions and ideas about how things should go down in my life and had no intention of putting in work for which I did not reap the full benefits . What I saw in her was a scared woman with low self-esteem and even lower self-worth . I guess our father 's absence had manifested itself that way for her , but that could never be me , I often told myself . I craved the good life-flyy clothes , blinding jewels , fast cars , and unlimited cash , and I wanted to be among those who craved the same things . But first , I knew , I had to get out of my momma 's house and up from under her rules . Hanging out was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could , Friday was the night that I always found my way into some underground spot hoping to meet someone who could help jump-start me toward my goal . Basement parties , house parties , block parties-if it was a party and there were lots of people , I was there . Like Lotto , ya got ta be in it to win it , and this particular Friday was no different . Carmen , who I spoke with on the phone frequently but rarely saw these days , had called me the night before and invited me to hang out at a club called the Vision with her and a new group of friends she had recently made . Needless to say , I was more than excited . I was tired of coming up empty at the local spots in my neighborhood , and the Vision was one of the premier nightclubs in New York City . The club had a velvet rope so thick that it metaphorically resembled a steel wall that no one was permitted beyond without a special pass . The only way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somebody . And even then , the bouncers looked you up and down and made the decision on whether you were cool enough to walk beyond its privileged doors . So I figured that whoever Carmen was rolling with must have been somebody pretty big for her to invite me there , and I could n't believe that little old me was going to be partying in one of the hottest celebrity hangouts in the city . And knowing Carm like I did , I knew I was in for a night filled with lessons and tests . School was always in session when I was with her and I was the anxious student , eager and willing to participate in an evening I would never forget .
