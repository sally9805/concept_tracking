<p> Bridging the digital divide in this African nation is n't just a matter of computer-equipment care packages and free Internet accounts . IN THE WEST AFRICAN COUNTRY OF GHANA , ONE OF THE WORLD 'S POOREST PLACES , THE BUSY SIGNAL IS A REMINDER OF THE UNFULFILLED PROMISE OF THE INFORMATION AGE . <p> Making a telephone call here requires persistence . Roughly half do n't go through because of system failures , but that 's only the start of Ghana 's telephone woes . The country has a mere 240,000 phone lines-for a population of 20 million spread across an area the size of Britain . Moreover , telephone bills are inaccurate , overcharges common , and the installation of a new line can cost a business more than $1,000 , the rough equivalent of the annual office rent . Lines are frequently stolen , sometimes with the connivance of employees of Ghana Telecom , the national carrier . Phones go dead , and remain unrepaired , for months . Some businesses hire staff for the chief purpose of dialing numbers until calls go through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gridlock . There are more mobile phones in Ghana than wired ones-about 300,000 , as of March-but the network is clogged because of a shortage of cell stations . Customers are bedeviled by what operators term " dropped calls . " Besides , calls are costly . The price of a one-minute wireless conversation , under the most common plan , is ten times higher than it would be in the United States . " The situation has come to a point of crisis , " says Kwesi Nduom , the country 's minister for economic planning . <p> Ghana 's telecom mess limits the utility of the Internet , raises the costs of information services-and suggests that the country is mired in the Stone Age , technologically . But the situation here , as in much of sub-Saharan Africa , defies such straightforward conclusions . There is another side to the country 's technological profile , a burgeoning homegrown technology culture that explodes assumptions about the inherent backwardness of Africa and the nature of the so-called digital divide . <p> That there is a gap in the use of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Europe and other wealthy regions is unsurprising . After all , development experts have long presumed that lags in technology , much like lags in medicine , stem from poverty-and only reducing poverty can close the technology gap . In the late 1990s , the pioneers of the personal computer , the mobile phone and the Internet saw their technologies as a fresh chance for Africa , an opportunity to leapfrog over what would normally be decades of conventional development . Luminaries such as Microsoft 's Bill Gates and Kofi Annan , secretary-general of the United Nations , began campaigning to close the digital divide . Influential international organizations , such as the G8 group of nations and the World Economic Forum , commissioned blueprints for raising the technological level of poor nations , in Africa especially . <p> So far , these plans have come to little or nothing . In the main , the rich have dropped boatloads of computers onto the poor with no awareness of the environment in which the machines will ( or will not ) be used . With results lacking , technophiles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic wand solves poverty-and to accept that they need to know much more about how people in developing countries live , and what they need and want , in order to close the digital divide . <p> These are some of the questions that have brought me to Ghana several times in the last two years , first as a foreign correspondent for the Wall Street Journal , and later as a visiting professor at the University of California , Berkeley , Graduate School of Journalism . In my visits , I 've seen information technologies changing the landscape in unexpected ways . The people I 've met are more adept at using these technologies , and are hungrier for them , than most experts believe . But their efforts to put advanced technologies to work in Ghana are often thwarted by the failings of much older infrastructure technologies-the phone system , the electric grid , even the roads . <p> A visit to a third-floor office in the high-rise known as the Pyramid in Ghana 's capital city , Accra , provides a look at one advanced-technology project that seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass walls , hundreds of men and women type at computer keyboards , reading American health insurance claims on their computer screens . Each claims form has been digitized in the United States by Aetna , the large insurer , and sent over a computer network to Accra . Here a typist culls the name , address and other personal information from the form , entering it into a new electronic form , which is then sent back to the U.S. <p> The key technology in this process is invisible : a satellite link that bypasses Accra 's creaky phone system and enables data to be sent overseas instantaneously . To set up the system , the facility 's manager , Bossman Dowuona-Hammond , convinced Ghana 's government that the satellite would not steal business from the country 's national phone company-or be used to interfere with Ghana 's politics . " In the past , fear prevented us from getting the tools we needed , " says Dowuona-Hammond . " With the right tools , we can compete . " Indeed , in one swoop , the satellite link has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All the workers at the data entry facility , from the site manager to the computer networking technician to the typists , are natives of Ghana . American supervisors , located in Salt Lake City and Lexington , KY , visit only occasionally ; from their U.S. bases they can view any form in Accra at any moment , peering electronically over the shoulder of any Ghanaian keypuncher , offering help and encouragement . <p> Local Ghanaian supervisors do much the same . Thomas Fabyan , smartly dressed in black suede shoes , khaki pants and a pressed white shirt buttoned to the neck , prods and cajoles his typists to push their limits . Fabyan sits in the corner of a large open room , with tall windows that overlook the city and give glimpses of the Atlantic Ocean . Along with a colleague , Fabyan is responsible for 275 employees who work over three shifts , round the clock . These typists are paid piece rate : the more records they complete , the greater their pay . The fastest workers can earn nearly three dollars a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar , still slightly higher than the pay of a local policeman . <p> Fabyan , who is 26 years old , represents the new wave of technologically savvy Ghanaians . He used his first PC at the age of 15 and later enrolled in Ghana 's top engineering school-then dropped out because he found the courses antiquated . He went to work for a local Internet service provider , where he installed the equipment required for Web access and later trained others to do the same . The job paid only $30 a month , though , and Fabyan knew he would need more technical expertise to earn a better salary . He decided to sign up for some online programming courses offered by British and U.S. training schools , convincing his father-a financial officer for a local company-to pony up the $800 in fees . Working from a computer in his parents ' home , Fabyan devoted more than a year to the courses . <p> Not long after completing his online studies , Fabyan responded to an advertisement and landed the supervisory job at the data entry facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network and learn more techniques that he hopes someday to apply in a business of his own . While his chief responsibility is managing keypunchers , in his spare time he recently helped construct an internal Web site where the data entry staff can get answers to common questions . " I want to be serious in IT , and this is a place to start , " Fabyan says . <p> Critics see it differently , insisting that data entry mainly sops up low-skilled workers . " The technological content of this work is quite thin , " says Nil Quaynor , a technology advisor to the World Bank and one of only a few residents of Ghana who have doctorates in computer science . " Is there really a future in this for people other than secretaries ? " He shakes his head . <p> Quaynor believes that multinational technology corporations ought to do more for African countries , including creating high-tech product development jobs for local workers . But Ghana is in dire need of jobs-and so the processing of American health-care forms by Ghanaians is potentially ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the places seemingly left behind by the computer revolution . <p> After all , processing forms is a worldwide activity that employs millions of people . Most large corporations , from credit card companies to health-care insurers , have contracted out the chore , and contractors run facilities in the Caribbean , Central America and Mexico and throughout Europe , Asia and the United States . Millions of people around the world work in offshore data entry facilities . Yet until Dallas-based Affiliated Computer Services-which processes Aetna 's forms along with those of companies such as Liberty Mutual and Health Net-opened this facility in Accra in late 2000 , not a soul was employed in this activity in sub-Saharan Africa , says Dowuona-Hammond . <p> Now , Ghanaians talk of someday hosting 100,000 computer jobs , or more , with keypunching as a base . In March 2002 , a second data entry company , Data Management Internationale , opened shop in Accra . The privately held firm , based in Wilmington , DE , is handling government forms for one large U.S. city at its Accra operation . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilot effort , the long-term prospects look strong . " We 're optimistic about generating the advantages of low-cost labor here , " says William Swezey , who launched Data Management 's Accra business and is the company 's vice president for technical services . " I clearly anticipate other companies coming here , and probably large ones . " <p> The potential for job growth is so great that last fall Ghana 's president , John Kufuor , made a surprise visit to the Affiliated Computer Services data entry office . He was impressed by the hundreds of computers he saw ( the most in any business in the country ) and the spotless working conditions . But what most amazed him , he told his aides , was that work proceeded round the clock , in a country where previously no white-collar work had ever been performed in evenings or the middle of the night . <p> The growth of data entry in Accra suggests that new information technologies can knit the world closer together by defeating distance and creating jobs . Yet despite working around Ghana 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hampered by other basic infrastructure problems that mock its high-tech sophistication . Frequent power outages-sometimes three or four a day-disrupt work and add to the wear and tear on computers . And the Pyramid building has such poor air conditioning that electric fans are needed to reduce heat in work spaces , in a bid to extend computer life . Such problems mean that , despite the lure of inexpensive labor in Ghana , " the barriers to entry here are very high , " says Swezey . " Anyone coming in from the outside will have a hard time getting up and running . " <p> This constant struggle with the local infrastructure is also being waged in Accra 's Internet cafs , whose numbers have expanded rapidly thanks to the scrappy ingenuity of their owners and employees . <p> Two years ago , Accra lacked a single Internet caf . Now the city boasts more than 600 of them , a consequence of plummeting prices for PCs and new ways of circumventing the phone system to reach Web servers . An hour online costs anywhere from 75 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people earn that much in a day . But a few years ago , Web access was far more expensive , when users had to phone places like London or Paris in order to get connected . The rise of Web cafs , combined with free e-mail services such as Hotmail and Yahoo ! , means that many Accra residents can receive personal electronic messages for the first time in their lives . This makes " the IT deficit " smaller than people think , says Ravi Amar , a Ghanaian who runs two Web cafs and assembles his own PCs from imported parts . " There 's much more computer use here than people realize " ( see " Closing the Gap , " below ) . <p> Keeping all those computers up , running and online presents some special challenges , though , as Richard Amaning well knows . A thin and wispy 29-year-old sporting a goatee and eyeglasses , Amaning is the manager of one of Accra 's most technically advanced Web cafs , Cyberia . The operation has a dozen PCs powered by 1.4-gigahertz Intel processors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provider through the city 's balky phone lines , Cyberia transfers data through a sophisticated wireless modem , which also increases network speed . <p> But one afternoon , as Amaning helps a customer print a document , all of Cyberia 's whiz-bang technology vanishes-when the electricity goes out . He tells the customers to be patient , and to stay at their computers . Then he runs down a long flight of stairs to the basement , kicks on a backup generator , dashes back upstairs and reboots all the PCs , one after another . That 's not the end of it , though . Since the generator is too costly to run any longer than necessary , Amaning must constantly check on neighboring shops to see when their lights return . When power is restored , he tells his customers to halt their work again and shut down , while he goes back to the basement , turns off the generator and switches the caf back to public electricity . <p> Amaning wants Cyberia to automate the process of switching to and from the generator , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , he is fortunate : there are no repeat interruptions . Amaning returns to helping the customer with printing . But the episode is a stark reminder that one must know much more than the ins and outs of computers to manage a network in Accra . <p> Amaning 's computing experiences also illustrate in microcosm the haphazard but promising ways in which Africans , relying largely on their own resources , are coming to terms with the digital revolution and attempting to make it their own . For all the expertise required by his job , Amaning has only completed high school . Eight years ago , an uncle offered him an apprenticeship at his computer repair shop . He liked fixing PCs and , while working , attended a computer training school . For 18 months , he learned the basics of PC hardware and networking , then joined a Web advertising agency-one of a handful in Accra-repairing PCs . <p> Wanting more skills , Amaning took a course on computer networking which helped him to understand the hardware requirements for computer networks , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national telephone and electricity systems , plug into the Web . After the course , he felt ready to manage a Web network . But finding a job took months . <p> Amaning 's break came when a friend , hired by Cyberia to fix a faulty modem , failed at the task and summoned Amaning for help . He got the modem working , and Cyberia 's owner hired him . His job is grueling : he works six days a week , from nine in the morning to 11 at night . He earns the equivalent of $125 a month-or roughly four times the average wage in Ghana . To earn even more than that , Amaning will have to improve his skills still further . " My next step " he says , " is to get myself into programming . " <p> Many of Ghana 's politicians are beginning to think that would-be programmers like Amaning have the right idea . Sam Somuah , an advisor to President Kufuor , clicks through his PowerPoint presentation on the government 's proposed information technology policy before a crowded room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the specifics of Somuah 's plan , but rather that he has a plan at all . Until late last year , Ghana 's political leaders seemed blithely unaware of information technology . Now it is seen as potential national salvation . " There 's no way we can raise our standard of living rapidly without IT , " Somuah says . <p> Somuah is chiefly concerned with improving government efficiency through information technology , but he also talks of spawning a generation of technology entrepreneurs . As a first step , the government of Ghana recently reached an agreement with India , which is promising to open a programming training center in Accra . Somuah also wants the government to launch a venture capital fund for technology enterprises . " Who knows , one of you might be the next Bill Gates , " he tells the group of young people who surround him after his talk . <p> Indeed , creating a programming industry would be a coup for Ghana 's leaders . Software requires little capital to write and can be sold relatively cheaply all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in a small country like Ghana , Somuah says . " I believe Accra can become , in time , another India , a Silicon Valley in Africa , " adds John Hooper , a Ghanaian graphics designer who opened a three-person company in Accra a year ago . <p> While Ghanaians should dream of a better future , their reality is sobering . Accra is home to fewer than 50 code writers who can program without close supervision , says Roger Oppong-Koranteng , a Ghanaian information technology manager who trained the president and his cabinet in the use of e-mail . " The pool of experienced people is very thin , " Oppong-Koranteng says . <p> Oppong-Koranteng believes that Ghana will eventually produce information technology innovations but warns against expecting too much too soon . Rather than form a venture capital fund , he says , the Ghanaian government should support programs that " bring Ghana 's inexperienced IT people together . Let them talk . When people talk , ideas come up-and someone will pick up the ideas and run with them . " <p> While code writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonelier still , because of the small size of the fraternity and the potential for programmers to get left behind by new technology-a fate that Dan Odamtten is struggling to avoid . At 29 , Odamtten has only a high-school diploma . His father wanted him to become a nurse , but he had another idea . " I thought computers were the future , " he explains . <p> To get started , Odamtten took a nine-month course at a computer institute , his mother paying the fees without telling her husband . He learned how to program in BASIC and , as an exercise , wrote a payroll program-but on graduation still found he could n't get a job . He begged Ananse Systems , a local software house that specializes in supplying programs to small banks , to train him without pay . The company agreed . <p> Odamtten began by installing shrink-wrapped software for the company 's banking clients . After six months , the company decided to put him on the payroll , but only at $30 a month . After another six months , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since moved to writing Windows programs too . The company now counts him as one of its best code writers and in January increased his salary to $350 a month , a princely sum by Accra standards . <p> Rather than celebrate , Odamtten worries about learning new skills . " I ca n't fall behind , " he says , while tapping on his Dell laptop . Sitting on the verandah of the company 's office , he is tailoring a database written in Microsoft Access to fit the needs of a rural customer . This is a far cry from writing original programs , but he does n't have the opportunity for such work . In a small company , he must do many things , from servicing customers to adapting mass-market programs for their specific needs to answering his boss 's phone calls . " Software means working long hours , " he says . <p> Odamtten 's workload is made heavier by bone-crunching automobile journeys . He typically travels three to five hours on Ghana 's poorly maintained and congested roads to visit clients . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " obviating the need for lengthy journeys , he says . But for now , he often rises before dawn to avoid the worst of the traffic . <p> Odamtten 's frustrations are Ghana 's writ large : the great potential of information technology-to liberate people from drudgery and saturate their lives with knowledge-is thwarted by tribulations that stem from an earlier , mechanical age . <p> On my first visit to Ghana , I went to the house of a Ghanaian friend . Like many homes in his part of Accra , his had no indoor plumbing , no kitchen , no telephone-not even a street address . My friend had never received paper mail . But two months before my visit he had gotten an e-mail address , an account on Yahoo ! , and for a few pennies could send his own message to relatives halfway around the world . In the last two years , I have watched my friend become more adept at using a PC , faster at surfing the Web . But while he remains excited about computing , his discontent grows . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , but this very knowledge makes him more aware of his own poverty , isolation , and , indeed , the long odds against his succeeding in Ghana . <p> My friend embodies the riddle , I think , of information technology in Africa and other parts of the developing world . The more I learn about how new technologies are altering ways of working and playing in Africa , the more I become convinced that they both hurt and help . I recently talked with Welsh-born entrepreneur Mark Davies , the founder of Ghana 's largest Internet caf , BusyInternet . When I asked him what his customers did online , he said , " Four out of five are trying to find ways to get out of Ghana . " <p> The lessons of Ghana are thus complicated . Information technology is not the great leveler that enthusiasts champion , but it also is not as far out of reach as skeptics say . The advanced-technology gap between rich and poor nations can not be explained purely as a function of poverty . And the most successful efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts of locals with those of emissaries from the developed world . <p> On the second floor of BusyInternet , upstairs from the caf , a Dutch couple runs a Web design business . An English woman has joined with an East African to launch an e-retailer offering African-made arts and crafts . Data Management , the latest data entry company , has its office on the floor as well-next door to a Ghanaian Web designer . Ultimately , this juxtaposition of foreign energy and local initiative could be just what Ghana needs , says Oppong-Koranteng , who is managing director of BusyInternet when he 's not giving computer lessons to his country 's president . " The foreigners rub off on us , triggering ideas , " Oppong-Koranteng says . " We must make them our own .
