Do n't be afraid . My telling ca n't hurt you in spite of what I have done and I promise to lie quietly in the dark -- weeping perhaps or occasionally seeing the blood once more -- but I will never again unfold my limbs to rise up and bare teeth . I explain . You can think what I tell you a confession , if you like , but one full of curiosities familiar only in dreams and during those moments when a dog 's profile plays in the steam of a kettle . Or when a corn-husk doll sitting on a shelf is soon splaying in the corner of a room and the wicked of how it got there is plain . Stranger things happen all the time everywhere . You know . I know you know . One question is who is responsible ? Another is can you read ? If a pea hen refuses to brood I read it quickly and , sure enough , that night I see a minha mpe standing hand in hand with her little boy , my shoes jamming the pocket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often there are too many signs , or a bright omen clouds up too fast . I sort them and try to recall , yet I know I am missing much , like not reading the garden snake crawling up to the door saddle to die . Let me start with what I know for certain . <br> The beginning begins with the shoes . When a child I am never able to abide being barefoot and always beg for shoes , anybody 's shoes , even on the hottest days . My mother , a minha mpe , is frowning , is angry at what she says are my prettify ways . Only bad women wear high heels . I am dangerous , she says , and wild but she relents and lets me wear the throwaway shoes from Senhora 's house , pointy-toe , one raised heel broke , the other worn and a buckle on top . As a result , Lina says , my feet are useless , will always be too tender for life and never have the strong soles , tougher than leather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , it 's 1690 . Who else these days has the hands of a slave and the feet of a Portuguese lady ? So when I set out to find you , she and Mistress give me Sir 's boots that fit a man not a girl . They stuff them with hay and oily corn husks and tell me to hide the letter inside my stocking -- no matter the itch of the sealing wax . I am lettered but I do not read what Mistress writes and Lina and Sorrow can not . But I know what it means to say to any who stop me . <br> My head is light with the confusion of two things , hunger for you and scare if I am lost . Nothing frights me more than this errand and nothing is more temptation . From the day you disappear I dream and plot . To learn where you are and how to be there . I want to run across the trail through the beech and white pine but I am asking myself which way ? Who will tell me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will they help me or harm me ? What about the boneless bears in the valley ? Remember ? How when they move their pelts sway as though there is nothing underneath ? Their smell belying their beauty , their eyes knowing us from when we are beasts also . You telling me that is why it is fatal to look them in the eye . They will approach , run to us to love and play which we misread and give back fear and anger . Giant birds also are nesting out there bigger than cows , Lina says , and not all natives are like her , she says , so watch out . A praying savage , neighbors call her , because she is once churchgoing yet she bathes herself every day and Christians never do . Underneath she wears bright blue beads and dances in secret at first light when the moon is small . More than fear of loving bears or birds bigger than cows , I fear pathless night . How , I wonder , can I find you in the dark ? Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is arranged . I will see your mouth and trail my fingers down . You will rest your chin in my hair again while I breathe into your shoulder in and out , in and out . I am happy the world is breaking open for us , yet its newness trembles me . To get to you I must leave the only home , the only people I know . Lina says from the state of my teeth I am maybe seven or eight when I am brought here . We boil wild plums for jam and cake eight times since then , so I must be sixteen . Before this place I spend my days picking okra and sweeping tobacco sheds , my nights on the floor of the cookhouse with a minha mpe . We are baptized and can have happiness when this life is done . The Reverend Father tells us that . Once every seven days we learn to read and write . We are forbidden to leave the place so the four of us hide near the marsh . My mother , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden to do this but he teaches us anyway watching out for wicked Virginians and Protestants who want to catch him . If they do he will be in prison or pay money or both . He has two books and a slate . We have sticks to draw through sand , pebbles to shape words on smooth flat rock . When the letters are memory we make whole words . I am faster than my mother and her baby boy is no good at all . Very quickly I can write from memory the Nicene Creed including all of the commas . Confession we tell not write as I am doing now . I forget almost all of it until now . I like talk . Lina talk , stone talk , even Sorrow talk . Best of all is your talk . At first when I am brought here I do n't talk any word . All of what I hear is different from what words mean to a minha mpe and me . Lina 's words say nothing I know . Nor Mistress 's . Slowly a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lina says the place of my talking on stone is Mary 's Land where Sir does business . So that is where my mother and her baby boy are buried . Or will be if they ever decide to rest . Sleeping on the cookhouse floor with them is not as nice as sleeping in the broken sleigh with Lina . In cold weather we put planks around our part of the cowshed and wrap our arms together under pelts . We do n't smell the cow flops because they are frozen and we are deep under fur . In summer if our hammocks are hit by mosquitoes Lina makes a cool place to sleep out of branches . You never like a hammock and prefer the ground even in rain when Sir offers you the storehouse . Sorrow no more sleeps near the fireplace . The men helping you , Will and Scully , never live the night here because their master does not allow it . You remember them , how they would not take orders from you until Sir makes them ? He could do that since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Sir has a clever way of getting without giving . I know it is true because I see it forever and ever . Me watching , my mother listening , her baby boy on her hip . Senhor is not paying the whole amount he owes to Sir . Sir saying he will take instead the woman and the girl , not the baby boy and the debt is gone . A minha mpe begs no . Her baby boy is still at her breast . Take the girl , she says , my daughter , she says . Me . Me . Sir agrees and changes the balance due . As soon as tobacco leaf is hanging to dry Reverend Father takes me on a ferry , then a ketch , then a boat and bundles me between his boxes of books and food . The second day it becomes hurting cold and I am happy I have a cloak however thin . Reverend Father excuses himself to go elsewhere on the boat and tells me to stay exact where I am . A woman comes to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak from my shoulders . Then my wooden shoes . She walks away . Reverend Father turns a pale red color when he returns and learns what happens . He rushes all about asking where and who but can find no answer . Finally he takes rags , strips of sailcloth lying about and wraps my feet . Now I am knowing that unlike with Senhor , priests are unlove here . A sailor spits into the sea when Reverend Father asks him for help . Reverend Father is the only kind man I ever see . When I arrive here I believe it is the place he warns against . The freezing in hell that comes before the everlasting fire where sinners bubble and singe forever . But the ice comes first , he says . And when I see knives of it hanging from the houses and trees and feel the white air burn my face I am certain the fire is coming . Then Lina smiles when she looks at me and wraps me for warmth . Mistress looks away . Nor is Sorrow happy to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though bees are bothering her . She is ever strange and Lina says she is once more with child . Father still not clear and Sorrow does not say . Will and Scully laugh and deny . Lina believes it is Sir 's . Says she has her reason for thinking so . When I ask what reason she says he is a man . Mistress says nothing . Neither do I. But I have a worry . Not because our work is more , but because mothers nursing greedy babies scare me . I know how their eyes go when they choose . How they raise them to look at me hard , saying something I can not hear . Saying something important to me , but holding the little boy 's hand . <br> Continues ...
