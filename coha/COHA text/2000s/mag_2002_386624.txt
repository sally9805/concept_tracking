BAZAAR ICONS Headnote In 1928 , Zelda and F. Scott Fitzqerald wrote for Bazaar about the dazzle of Park Avenue . Here , Eleanor Lanahan , the Fitzgeralds ' granddaughter , introduces some of their unseen love letters . // To mention F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald is to invoke the ' ' 20s , the Jazz Age , romance , and outrageous early success , with all its attendant perils . The names Scott and Zelda conjure gleaming hotel lobbies and smoky speakeasies , flappers , and nostalgia for the Lost Generation . And even though they are my grandparents , I ca n't fail to mention that Scott 's alcoholism and Zelda 's madness are a powerful part of the myth . My grandparents ' lives are as fascinating to me as their artistic achievements . Despite their short and nomadic lives  --  Scott was born in 1896 and died in 1940 , at the age of 44 , eight years before Zelda-they left an abundance of correspondence , a window into an extraordinary romance . Several collections of Scott 's letters have already been published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harold Ober , to his editor , Maxwell Perkins , and to my mother , Scottie . This new collection , Dear Scott , Dearest Zelda , however , is the first to assemble Scott and Zelda 's letters to each other in one book , including many previously unpublished letters , a few of which appear here . The fairy tale began when Scott and Zelda met in 1918 , at a country-club dance in Montgomery , Alabama . Lt. F. Scott Fitzgerald was among the many soldiers stationed at nearby Fort Sheridan , awaiting orders to fight overseas . Zelda , gifted with beauty , grace , high spirits , and expert skills of flirtation , was one of the most popular belles in the region . The ratio of soldiers to young women was tipped heavily in favor of the women , and competition was fierce among suitors , but Scott won Zelda 's heart . The war ended just as Scott was preparing to go to France , and he was discharged in February 1919 . A month later , they were engaged . The Fitzgeralds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' 20s . The ticker tape had barely settled along the Fifth Avenue parade route , welcoming the troops home from World War I , when Scott 's first novel , This Side of Paradise , astonished his publishers and sold out of its entire first printing . A week after publication , on April 3 , 1920 , he and Zelda were married . Twenty-three-yearold Scott , an overnight celebrity , told the press that his greatest ambitions were to write the best novel that ever was and to stay in love with his wife forever . The newlyweds gave America a fresh image of itself as youthful , funloving , free-spending , hardworking , and innovative . And they were n't too sophisticated to plunge into the Plaza fountain or spin in the hotel 's revolving doors . My mother was born on October 26 , 1921 , and was immediately assigned to the care of a nanny . " Children should n't be a bother , " Zelda explained . During the early years of their marriage , Zelda seemed content to become a decorative wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For three years , she threw all of her creative energy into ballet . The strain of such physical discipline , begun at the late age of 27 , is thought to have contributed to Zelda 's exhausted mental state . When she suffered her first breakdown , in 1930 , the fairy tale ended . Her first letters from the Prangins Clinic in Switzerland , and Scott 's first letters from Paris , are bitter , blameful reinterpretations of their whole relationship . Very little was understood about the nature of Zelda 's suffering . Treatment for schizophrenia was in its infancy . By this time , my grandfather 's alcoholism was also full-blown . It 's no secret that F. Scott Fitzgerald was one of the most famous alcoholics who ever lived . But he was a " high-functioning " alcoholic , which made it even more difficult for him to acknowledge or treat his problem . I believe , as my mother did , that Scott and Zelda stayed in love until they died . Perhaps ii became an impossible and impractical love  --  part nostalgia and part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the best qualities ir each other that they had once celebrated , and the happy times they had shared , but it was a bond that united them forever . March 1919 , letter to Scott from Montgomery , Alabama : Sweetheart , Please , please do n't be so depressed-We 'll be married soon , and then these lonesome nights will be over forever-and until we are , I am loving , loving every tiny minute of the day and night ... Scott-there 's nothing in all the world I want but you-and your precious love-All the material things are nothing . I 'd just hate to live a sordid , colorless existence-because you 'd soon love me less-and less  --  and I 'd do anything-anything-to keep your heart for my own-I do n't want to live-I want to love first , and live incidentally-Why do n't you feel that I 'm waiting-I 'll come to you , Lover , when you 're ready-Do n't  --  do n't ever think of the things you ca n't give me-You 've trusted me with the dearest heart of all-and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world has ever had How can you think deliberately of life without me-If you should die-O Darling  --  darling Scot sic  --  It 'd be like going blind . I know I would , too-I 'd have no purpose in life-just a pretty-decoration . Do n't you think I was made for you ? I feel like you had me ordered-and I was delivered to you-to be worn-I want you to wear me , like a watch-charm or a button hole boquet sic-to the world . And then , when we 're alone , I want to help-I know that you ca n't do anything without me ... This is Thursday , and the ring has n't come-I want to wear it so people can see  --  All my heart  --  I love you Zelda March 1919 , telegram to Zelda from New York City : Miss Leida sic Sayre Six Pleasant Ave Montg-Ala . Sweetheart I have been frightfully busy but you know I have thought of you every minute will write at length tomorrow got your letter and loved it everything looks fine you seem with me always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scott sent Zelda an engagement ring on March 24 , 1919 . In response to a love letter from Zelda , Scott sent her a feather fan . April 1919 , letter to Scott from Montgomery , Alabama : Those feathers-those wonderful , wonderful feathers are the most beautiful things on earth-so soft like little chickens , and rosy like fire-light-I feel so rich and pompous waving them around in the air and covering up myself with " emDarling , it is the prettiest thing in the world , and you were so sweet to send itThat color is rather becoming ... I love you , Scott , with all my heart  --  Scott and Zelda were married in April 1920 . Ten years later , Zelda had a mental breakdown . She spent most of the next 18 years in clinics and institutions . Fall 1930 , letter to Scott from Prangins Clinic , Nyon , Switzerland : Dear Scott : The panic seems to have settled into a persistent gloom punctuated by moments of bombastic hysteria , which is , I suppose a relatively wholesome state . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sic than this foul eczema , still the crises of the sinking bed and the hydraulic heart have been more or less mastered and I am waiting impatiently for when you can come to see me if you will-Do you still smell of pencils and sometimes of tweed ? Yesterday I had some gramophone discs that reminded me of Ellerslie . I wonder why we have never been very happy and why all this has happened-It was much nicer a long time ago when we had each other and the space about the world was warm  --  Ca n't we get it back someway  --  even by imagining ? ... Dear , I will be so glad to see you  --  Sometimes , it 's desperate to be so alone-and you ca n't be very happy in a hotel room . We were awfully used to having each other about . Zelda Dr. Forel told me to ask you if you had stopped drinking-so I ask  --  The following letter was written while Scott was living in California , writing screenplays and suffering from tuberculosis . May 29 , 1939 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From your letter I picture you imagining the situation much worse than it is . In the first place , the touch of T.B . is not as bad as it was in 1935 and the surrounding morale situation makes it entirely a different proposition . At that time , I was getting deeper into debt-I was terribly discouraged about the comparatively small sale of " Tender Is the Night "  --  I had Scottie on my hands as an adolescent with almost no place to turn for help ... and last and most important , you were an awfully sick girl yourself , in fact you had reached the very lowest point of your illness-now all that is changed and if you could see me dictating this now , sitting up in a corner of my room , fully dressed with the sun shining and full of hope and plans and merely a littie angry with myself for taking on those last two jobs when I felt my health breaking , you would lose the despondency which I detect in your letters . I am quite able to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish you 'd think of me as getting better every day and more and more anxious to see you .... Ever devotedly , Scott died of a heart attack on December 21 , 1940 . Zelda died in a hospital fire on March 10 , 1948 . From Dear Scott , Dearest Zelda : The Love Letters of F.
