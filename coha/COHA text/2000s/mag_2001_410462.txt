EPA Disregards Science <p> On July 19 , the Environmental Protection Agency issued a regulation that is genuinely anti-consumer , anti-environment and anti-farmer . The only beneficiaries will be a handful of big agribusiness companies , and the regulators themselves . <p> The subject of the regulation , the use of gene-splicing techniques to enhance the intrinsic pest-resistance of crop and garden plants , offers a versatile , safe , and viable alternative to chemical pesticides ; but the testing and commercialization of these plants have been systematically obstructed since 1994 , when EPA first , proposed to regulate them as though they were dangerous chemical pesticides . These innovative varieties have already demonstrated their commercial , environmental and public health benefits . An example is gene-spliced " Bt-cotton , " which differs from other varieties by the presence of a single protein from an ubiquitous and innocuous bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) . The protein , made by a gene transferred to the cotton plant by gene-splicing techniques , is toxic to certain insects but not to humans or other mammals . The approach is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria have been sprayed onto plants by home gardeners and commercial farmers , with an admirable record of both safety and effectiveness . <p> The Bt-cotton is used to control several major pests , the cotton and pink bollworm and the tobacco budworm , which account for a quarter of all losses due to pest infestations and cost farmers more than $150 million annually . In 1999 , states that had a high rate of adoption of Bt-cotton showed a significant reduction in the need to treat fields with chemical pesticides . Treatments were cut from an average of three per acre to about one and a half . Bt-cotton has eliminated the need for more than two million pounds of chemical pesticides since it was introduced in 1996 . <p> In purely economic terms , the aggregate advantage to cotton farmers nationally  --  the net value of crops not lost to pests , savings in pesticides and so on  --  is in the range of $100 million to $150 million per year , <p> But the economic benefits pale beside the environmental advantages . Three of the chemicals that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  endosulfan , methyl parathion and profenos  --  are thought to have negative effects on birds , fish and other aquatic organisms . <p> The adoption of Bt-cotton and the resulting lessened need for chemical pesticides also reduces occupational exposures to the toxic chemicals by workers who mix , load and apply the pesticides , and who perform other activities that require their presence in the field . Moreover , the smaller the amounts of pesticides that are applied , the less runoff into waterways , a major problem in many farming regions . <p> Another agricultural threat amenable to these genetic approaches is the growing infestation of California 's grapevines by Pierce 's disease , a bacterial infection spread by a leaf-hopping insect , the glassy-winged sharpshooter . The introduction of new vines with enhanced genetic resistance to either the bacterium or the insect is a promising strategy . For example , one can transfer genes that confer resistance into California 's grapes from distantly related , non-commercial grapes that have natural immunity . But conventional grape breeding is a notoriously slow process , and attempts to use the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just-finalized EPA regulatory policy . As does the approach of University of Florida researchers who have patented a group of resistance genes that are a synthetic version of those found in a variety of organisms . And as does another gene-splicing trick that introduces a gene that could permit new vines to bear fruit years earlier than usual . <p> Federal regulation of gene-spliced plants is inconsistent and discriminatory , and bears no proportionality to risk . In fact , there is arguably inverse proportionality to risk , in that the more precisely crafted and more predictable gene-spliced organisms are subjected to far more stringent regulation than more crudely crafted organisms . This violates a cardinal principle of regulation : that the degree of regulatory scrutiny should be commensurate with the risk . The EPA holds the new technology to an inappropriate standard , requiring hugely expensive testing of gene-spliced crop and garden plants , such as cotton , grapes and tomatoes , as though they were chemical pesticides  --  a policy that has been repeatedly condemned by the scientific community . The agency has imposed requirements that could not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of which have been engineered for pest and disease resistance ) , and its policies fail to recognize that there are important differences between spraying synthetic , toxic chemicals , and genetic approaches to enhancing plants ' natural pest resistance . <p> By way of background , there is a broad and long-standing scientific consensus about the continuum between conventional and new biotechnology , which was capsulized thusly in an authoritative 1989 analysis of the new biotechnology by the United States National Research Council : " With classical techniques of gene transfer , a variable number of genes can be transferred , the number depending on the mechanism of transfer ; but predicting the precise number or the traits that have been transferred is difficult , and we can not always predict the behavior that will result . With organisms modified by molecular methods , we are in a better , if not perfect , position to predict their behavior . " A 1992 editorial in the distinguished scientific journal , Nature , made a similar point : " The same physical and biological laws govern the response of organisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by classical methods . " Therefore , " no conceptual distinction exists between genetic modification of plants and microorganisms by classical methods or by molecular techniques that modify DNA and transfer genes . " <p> Scientists worldwide agree that adding genes to plants does not make them less safe either to the environment or for humans to eat . Dozens of new plant varieties produced through hybridization and other traditional methods of genetic improvement enter the marketplace each year without scientific review or special labeling . Many such products are from " wide crosses , " hybridizations in which genes are moved from one species or one genus to another to create a plant variety that does not and can not exist in nature . For example , Triticum agropyrotriticum is a new man-made " species " that resulted from combining genes from bread wheat and a grass sometimes called quackgrass or couch-grass . Possessing all the chromosomes of wheat and one extra whole genome from the quackgrass ( containing tens of thousands of genes ) , T. agropyrotriticum has been independently produced in the former Soviet Union , Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is grown for both human food and animal feed . ( To illustrate the inconsistency of the EPA 's approach , if a single gene from quackgrass were introduced into wheat by gene-splicing techniques , the resulting plant would be subject to the EPA 's draconian review and licensing process for pesticides . ) <p> EPA 's policy is so potentially damaging and outside scientific norms that it has galvanized the scientific community , which has repeatedly and unequivocally condemned the agency 's approach . Dozens of major scientific societies representing more than 100,000 biologists and food professionals have warned that the EPA policy discourages the development of new pest-resistant crops , prolongs and increases the use of synthetic chemical pesticides , increases the regulatory burden for developers of pest-resistant crops , expands federal and state bureaucracies , limits the use of biotechnology to larger developers who can pay the inflated regulatory costs , and handicaps the United States in competition for international markets . <p> The predictions have come true . The EPA 's policy has already caused extraordinary mischief : namely , the recall of corn products found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which differs from other commercial varieties by containing a protein called Cry9C . This bacterial protein , introduced into corn with gene-splicing techniques , was approved by EPA for animal feed but not for humans because , although it does not resemble known allergens , it was not immediately degraded in digestion tests . ( Most food allergens are not readily digested , so the EPA wanted more data before concluding that consumers could not be allergic to the protein . ) <p> However , the food products in question are actually far less likely than thousands of other products on the market to cause allergic or other health problems . For example , more than 20 million Americans report that they are allergic to peanuts , and about 125 deaths a year are attributed to food allergy ; and fava beans , a fixture of upscale restaurant cuisine in North America and Europe , can be life-threatening to persons with a relatively common hereditary enzyme deficiency . Unlike those situations , however , even after exhaustive testing , no allergic reactions , toxicity or any other problem have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The ultimate irony is that one of the more promising applications of gene-splicing to new food will be to reduce the allergenicity of common foods , by deleting the genes that produce the offending proteins . The ripple effect of this StarLink non-problem is monumental , and growing . Because EPA classified the Cry9C as a pesticide , FDA was forced to recall the hundreds of products found to contain minute traces of the gene or protein . " Contamination " with StarLink 's Cry9C has been found in corn exported to Japan , which annually imports about 16 million tons of U.S. feed corn ( worth around $2 billion ) and has a policy of " zero tolerance " for the banned variety ( and considers violations to be criminal ) . The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries finally accepted a baroque U.S. plan to for testing corn exports to ensure that they are free from StarLink . <p> The just finalized regulation concerned with gene-spliced plants is not the first time that biotechnology ( and society ) has been a victim of EPA 's wrong-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Toxic Substances Control Act , the effect of which has been to halt most research into any " new " microorganism  --  defined inexplicably as one containing combinations of DNA from unrelated sources  --  that might be used , for example , to degrade oil spills or clean up toxic wastes , For EPA , " newness " is synonymous with risk , and because gene-splicing techniques call easily be used to create new gene combinations with DNA from disparate sources , these techniques therefore " have the greatest potential to pose risks to people or the environment , " according to the agency 's tortured logic . However , as described above , a broad scientific consensus holds that the genetic technique employed is irrelevant to risk , as is the origin of a snippet of DNA that may be moved from one organism to another ; what matters is its function . <p> The EPA 's inept approach to biotechnology is not an anomaly . According to the Office of Management and Budget , of the 30 least cost-effective regulations on the list , no fewer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reinforced by an analysis by Washington-D.C. based Resources for the Future , which examined eight major EPA regulatory programs of the past two decades . RFF concluded that " EPA for a variety of reasons is unwilling , unable , and unequipped to address and acknowledge the uncertainties in the underlying science . " <p> The new EPA regulation is only one symptom of the rot within the agency , but it is a serious one . The new regulation ensures that the potential of biotechnology applied to agriculture and food production is tarnished , as is the health of the environment . <p> By Henry I.
