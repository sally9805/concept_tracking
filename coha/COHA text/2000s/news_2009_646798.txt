LITTLE ROCK  --  When a senior editor at New York-based SmartMoney magazine addressed an economic forecast conference here in November , he opened by joking about how nice it was to come to a place where people were n't jumping off buildings because of financial distress . <p> It was a perfect icebreaker , largely because it rang true . In Little Rock and in several other corners of the country , the financial crash has been more of a fender-bender  --  at least so far . <p> Layoffs and foreclosures are on the rise and some business investments are on hold , but unemployment rates remain well below the national level in Arkansas and several other states , including Wyoming , North Dakota , Wisconsin and West Virginia . New companies are moving in and some are expanding , adding a few hundred jobs here and a few hundred there . <p> In December , Forbes named Little Rock one of the best middle-class housing markets because median home prices were rising while the national market was plummeting . <p> Those small successes are magnified in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that have never been economic highfliers or big population gainers . " Arkansas never really experienced extreme highs or extreme lows , " says Jim Youngquist , director of the Institute for Economic Advancement at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock . <p> This unassuming , steady-as-it-goes growth pattern is why places that did not enjoy dizzying highs before the recession are experiencing a gentler fall now . <p> " We 're gratified that ... we 've kind of withstood it , " Arkansas Gov . Mike Beebe says . " But we 're not immune from it . " <p> " Heading into this recession , from Texas up to Montana , the upper Great Plains and mountain states have been doing much better in 2007 and into 2008 and starting out 2009 , " says Jim Diffley , managing director of regional services for IHS Global Insight , an economic analysis firm . <p> Many states " did not participate in the housing boom and bust , and households have not seen their wealth evaporate , " Diffley says . At the same time , some regions benefited from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agriculture . That edge is slipping as prices drop , and states that have been spared so far will feel the pain , he says . They could recover faster , however , because they 're diversified and not overwhelmed by the mortgage meltdown . <p> The feverish housing boom that sent prices soaring in states such as Arizona , Nevada and Florida never landed in places such as Little Rock . Nor did the subsequent meltdown that collapsed prices and triggered a wave of foreclosures . <p> Unemployment rates in several metropolitan areas in Arkansas are well below the national average . The number for the Little Rock area is 4.9% . <p> Wisconsin , which is faring better than other Midwestern states decimated by hemorrhaging in the auto industry ( 6.2% compared with 10.6% in Michigan , 8.2% in Indiana and 7.8% in Ohio ) , never enjoyed big jumps in wages , says Joel Rogers of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy . <p> " Wisconsin was not booming and had not been booming for some time , " he says . <p> Diversifying a key strategy <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vital to an area 's ability to weather the financial crisis : <p> *In central Arkansas 11-county region that includes the capital city of Little Rock , jobs come from state government , higher education and medical centers . Now , the area is capturing a slice of the soaring wind energy industry by luring windmill blade manufacturers such as LM Glasfiber and Polymarin Composites , which together hope to hire more than 1,500 people in the Little Rock metropolitan area ( population 665,000 ) . <p> HP , one of the world 's largest technology companies , is building a customer service and technical support center that will employ 1,200 in Conway , north of Little Rock . Caterpillar just announced that it will locate its new North American production facility in North Little Rock , creating 600 jobs . The Fayetteville Shale formation in central Arkansas holds the promise of bountiful natural gas production and more jobs . Indian company Welspun Gujarat Stahl Rohren Ltd. , maker of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry , is building a facility in Little Rock . <p> The Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arkansas River expand from a single building to several blocks of shops , museums , bars and restaurants . <p> Without fast growth , home construction is slower  --  lessening the risk of new mortgages going bad , prices plunging and foreclosures spreading when the economy turns bad . <p> The number of homes sold here in Pulaski County dipped in 2008 , but the median sales prices rose 1% to $142,500 and the average number of days on the market grew by only three . Foreclosure rates are up but remain very low compared with other parts of the country . <p> In northwestern Arkansas , where growth exploded in recent years from Bentonville to Fayetteville because of big employers such as Wal-Mart , Tyson Food and J.B. Hunt , the foreclosure rate is much higher than around Little Rock . Wal-Mart said this month it will cut 700 to 800 jobs at headquarters in the area . <p> *Wisconsin 's economy is spread over 11 metropolitan areas  --  none as dominant as Detroit in Michigan or Chicago in Illinois  --  so trouble in one does n't necessarily drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the auto industry but not as many as Michigan , Ohio and Indiana . General Motors announced last year that it would close its plant in Janesville , Wis. , by 2010 , a loss of 2,400 jobs . <p> " It affects Janesville and the surrounding area greatly , but not so much the rest of the state , " says Dennis Winters , chief of the Office of Economic Advisors in the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development . " A lot of industries are doing really well  --  electric machinery , manufacturing equipment , export market . " The state is home to companies that make motorcycles ( Harley-Davidson ) , boats , giant cranes and medical devices . <p> *In Roanoke , Va. , a city of 93,000 , the largest employer is Carilion Clinic , a health care company of more than 10,000 workers . Mortgage delinquencies are below the national average . <p> " We 're kind of a steady player , " says Beth Doughty , executive director of the Roanoke Regional Partnership . " We do n't have dramatic ups and , consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A $60 million art museum just opened , and Carilion is building a medical school with Virginia Tech , whose main campus is in nearby Blacksburg . " The only sectors adding jobs are health care and education , " Doughty says , " and we 're strong in both . " <p> Cutbacks still occurring <p> Things may be going better in central Arkansas than in other parts of the country , but that does n't mean all is rosy . <p> There are cutbacks . LM Glasfiber , the Danish windmill blade manufacturer , announced last month it would lay off 150 at its plant here . Arkansas general revenue declined in December by $20.2 million compared with the same month the previous year because of a drop in income and sales tax collections . <p> " There 's a large emphasis on tying education , workforce education , to the needs of businesses coming to an area , " Gov . Beebe says . " I do n't think anything is as important as the quality of the workforce . " <p> That 's why Pulaski Technical College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy industries . Donny Pointer has been an account development manager at Coca-Cola for 15 years , but he 's always had a second job  --  until now . That 's why he 's taking a 20-hour training course to prepare for jobs at the new Polymarin plant . <p> " I need some supplemental income , " Pointer says . <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
