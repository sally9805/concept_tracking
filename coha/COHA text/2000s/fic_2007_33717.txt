The Old Man said , " I find myself longing to see a tournament . We have the perfect ingredients , two knights , one Christian and one Saracen . There will be a contest between yourself and the Earl of Ravensgarth and the prize , " his eyes were like fireworks , " will of course be the king 's ransom . . . . What could be fairer ? Each man fighting not just for his life but for his cause ? " Kamil had to speak now . " And Ellie ? " He could hardly breathe . Immediately he knew he had made a mistake . " The girl ? " The Old Man held his hands in the air . Kamil could only nod . " Oh , I did n't realize she mattered ! " The Old Man looked craftily from under his eyelashes . " I know ! We 'll make her part of the prize . Let 's see . If you kill the earl , you can have her to do what you like with . But , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earl kills you , I think perhaps I should take her back to Syria with me . I 'm sure I can find a use for her . "
