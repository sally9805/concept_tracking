Headnote DON IMUS Made The Fatal Mistake That Many Do : When you are n't a part of a certain group , you can get in trouble for saying the wrong thing " Work it , b**** ! " Had those three words been uttered by a man on cable TV , there is a good bet that protest groups would be up in arms , calling on him to apologize for calling women out of their name . But this was n't a morning show being led by a 66-year-old White man with a racist and sexist past . It was a young Black woman talking to a group of other women on VH1 's Flavor of Love Girls : Charm School , starring Mo'Nique . Let 's stop acting like we do n't know the deal . A woman can get away with that comment without rebuke . A man ? Do n't even think about it unless you want to be seriously checked ( or worse , fired ) . That was the hard lesson former radio show host Don Imus was taught . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are just some things you do n't have license to say . It 's not a Black thing , a White thing , a woman thing , a man thing , or even an American thing . It 's called life . " Business is relationship-based . Relationships are relationship-based . They are not transactional , " says Dr. Carl Bell , CEO of the Chicago-based Community Mental Health Council and professor of psychiatry , University of Illinois School of Public Health . " And the thing for males , especially those with entitlement dysfunction , is they do n't have respect . They do n't have a good sense of boundaries . " They do n't . I know when some words are okay and not okay . It 's contextual . And to misconstrue it and the context is playing with fire . " You 've got to be a member before you start taking privileges of members . And that 's the problem . Plus , words can be disrespectful , depending on their meaning and who is using them and the context . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking about just bad judgment . " Imus tried to fire back at his critics by suggesting that rappers use such language and it 's accepted , and it 's a double standard to suggest that his using it is wrong . Poor Don , you still do n't get it . There are many of us who find it offensive , but what is accepted within a peer group is not always fine with another . Women can say certain words to women . Gays can say particular words to gays . Blacks can say some choice words to one another . In fact , individuals who are friends of different ethnic groups may deem it just fine to use racial slurs among themselves-if they all agree to it-but if an Asian is speaking to someone Black who is n't a part of their concentric circle , then he might have some trouble on his hands . And vice versa . But it goes deeper than that . As a member a fraternity , I can joke around and cap on a fellow fraternity brother . But if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking gets tossed aside . He 's not a member and does n't have the privilege of making such comments . This also plays out on the big screen . How many military movies have you seen when a member of the Army insults someone in the Navy , Air Force or Marines , and a fight breaks out ? A high school basketball point guard can ride his fellow teammates for their play , but when a guy on the other team spits a few negative words , call a timeout because it 's about to get physical . " There are different rules of behavior for different groups . What 's appropriate changes by the setting . That is often lost , " says author Cora Daniels , whose anger at the use of " ghetto " in the mainstream , especially by people like Martha Stewart and Paris Hilton , led her to write Ghettonation : A Journey into the Land of Bling and Home of the Shameless . She says where Imus erred was in not realizing the setting he was in , and by his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's the problem with our language now . When people are being very critical of young people 's use or misuse , generally it 's because I think people are worried that we do n't know how to switch between content anymore . That becomes a problem , " according to Daniels . " When you stand on the corner with your boys and say certain things , that is n't appropriate in all settings . You use it differently on the corner than what you say to your mom and on your job . " Daniels says the desire is to always be respectful-even in private-but she concedes what people say behind closed doors should differ from what is said publicly . Journalist Jabari Asim refuses to accept the rationale offered by some that it 's fine for Blacks to use the N-word among themselves but not for others to do so . He personally prefers that it is never used . Yet Asim says individual groups must choose some level of consensus to allow others to use the words with impunity . " With queer , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . That 's between homosexuals , " says Asim , a reporter for the Washington Post . " They can determine that . It 's not for me to say it , so I 'm not offending any of them ... the rules are different from that group and outsiders . " Even comedian Paul Mooney , who is known for his noholds-barred use of the N-word ( before the Michael Richards debacle ) , Whites , racism , and other subjects in his stand-up routine , admits that " there is a code " in comedy that some ca n't cross . White comedians must be really careful in their use of racial epithets when joking about another group ( who can forget gays and lesbians slamming Eddie Murphy for his comedy in Ran ' and Delirious ) . " The problem is that White is the new Black , " Mooney says . " White folks want to be Black . They 've gone insane . " ( I was n't sure if Mooney was doing his shtick or was dead serious . I would put money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell says it 's foolish for some people to pretend that they do n't know the rules of engagement . " If you and I are friends and you say something about my momma , I know you mean no harm . You are playing around . If I do n't know you and I do n't like you and you say something about my momma , it 's a completely different situation , " he says . " Why it is that some people do n't understand that and think they can step across that boundary-at will-shows a complete lack of respect and disregard of the boundaries they are stepping into . " None of this is an attempt to suggest that saying the Nword is perfectly fine to toss around . I 've stopped using it myself and have written extensively for Blacks to strike it from our vocabulary . And if you want to call someone ab****ora he , that is being grossly disrespectful to Sisters around the globe . But let 's be real . What we say to each other is really between us and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may not think it 's fair . That 's just the way it is .
