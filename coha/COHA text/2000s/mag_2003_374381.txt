A <P> ATKINS DIET This was the year the naysayers in the medical establishment got high-cholesterol egg on their faces . For three decades , the experts railed against Dr. Robert Atkins and his popular steak-heavy , high-fat , low-carb nutrition plan . Then came surprising new studies showing that the diet not only works ( pound for pound , up to 100% better than low-fat diets ) but also appears to be good for the heart , lowering triglycerides and raising HDL , the " good " cholesterol . Studies were small , however , and the results preliminary . The last word will probably have to wait for the big five-year , $2.5 million clinical trial , sponsored by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , that is tracking the health effects of the Atkins diet on 360 obese Americans . Meanwhile , the bottom line has n't changed : you lose weight only when you burn more calories than you eat . ( See E for Exercise . ) <P> AIDS It was another bleak year for AIDS , as a U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among its findings : 40 million people are infected with HIV , 3 million of them children . All told , more than 20 million have died of AIDS since 1981 . Progress in the research labs has been slow and not that steady , but it has produced some results . Scientists discovered three proteins  --  alpha-defensins 1 , 2 and 3  --  that may account for the so-called non-progressors , the 1% or 2% of people who contract HIV but never develop AIDS . Also , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved a new rapid HIV test called OraQuick , which reliably detects HIV antibodies in a blood sample in less than 30 minutes . <P> ASPIRIN For a little white pill that costs pennies , aspirin may be the closest thing we will ever find to a wonder drug . Not only does it relieve headaches , ease the pain of arthritis and thin the blood to ward off strokes and heart attacks , but as we learned last year , it may also protect against cancers of the pancreas , colon and prostate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that aspirin is n't a wonder drug for everyone : some 30% of Americans are aspirin resistant and may need either higher doses or a different drug altogether . <P> B <P> BOTOX <P> 2002 was the year of the Botox party  --  a festive variation on the Tupperware klatch  --  in which women gather for tea sandwiches and a shot of diluted botulinum toxin in the face . The FDA last year approved the use of Botox , which creates a temporary and localized paralysis in facial muscles , for smoothing wrinkles between the eyebrows . But doctors are also using the shots for such " off-label " applications as crow's-feet , furrowed brows and other frown lines . If the sight of all those glassy Botoxed faces is giving you a headache , get this : researchers at Wake Forest University found that Botox also staves off migraines in sufferers who ca n't get relief from other drugs . Expect more Botox approvals.
