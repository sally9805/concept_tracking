I am here to relieve your guilt . If you are a normal , taxpaying American , you will not vote . And everyone wants to make you feel bad about it . MTV may not have a problem with misogyny , gay bashing or pouring champagne on the chests of bikinied women in the name of high-volume pimping , but it draws its line in the moral desert at staying home on Election Day . I 've noticed , however , that it has quieted down on the whole Rock the Vote thing ever since Jesse Camp won the Wannabe a VJ poll . <P> I first heard this get-out-and-vote rhetoric in seventh grade , when my civics teacher told our class that , if we did n't vote , we 'd forfeit our right to complain . There is no more effective scare tactic on a class filled with 13-year-old Jewish boys , other than to mess with our Bar Mitzvah money . But voting so that you can whine is probably not what the framers had in mind . I do n't remember seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights . Besides , voting actually endangers your right to complain because you might vote for the winner , thus making you partly responsible . Mr. Convery responded to that logic with extra homework . <P> There 's good reason people do n't vote . Voting is a pain in the ass . Plus it usually requires walking into a public school , which is n't something most people ever want to do again , especially if they had Mr. Convery . Luckily , we can afford to stay home because things are going well and we know from Minnesota that no leader can mess it up too badly . While this election might matter to you if you 're gay or an N.R.A . member , for the rest of us , as well as gay N.R.A . members , it 's a wash . Our desire to avoid change gave us two bland , ineffectual candidates . Not committing to one of them is just our strange way of saying I love you . I may have some other issues going on here . <P> I 'm sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , likability polls or what those undecided people on NBC think after debates . These are people who signed up to tell America they do n't have anything to say . And as soon as they decide , they get kicked off the panel . It 's like Idiot Survivor . <P> The government does everything it can to get you to vote : it even sets up a curtained booth to trick you into thinking that pulling the lever will cause a naked woman to dance . That first election I voted in , I must have pulled every lever eight times . I alone ensured Perot got his matching funds . <P> The ruling class wants you to vote because voting tricks you into believing you have an equal stake in the power structure . You are less likely to revolt if you feel included in determining who gets to look down Arianna Huffington 's blouse at Washington parties . <P> Voting is not a charitable act . It does n't help others or ensure a continued democracy . You can be more effective donating those two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story to Jimmy Carter . He 's getting up there . Better yet , find someone who favors the candidate you were going to vote against , and stay home together talking about the issues . It wo n't accomplish anything , but it will help us get election results more quickly . And that means an earlier work night on Nov. 7 for me.
