Photograph // January in Yellow stone is so cold you might wonder if the sun has lost its fire . Bison plow through the snow wearing masks of ice . Elk climb the hillsides near Tower Junction , sending out frosty clouds with every breath . While on most winter days this is a quiet place , today brings the sound of an aircraft engine drifting across the slopes of the Buffalo Plateau . Raise your binoculars and you 'll spot a Bell jet Ranger helicopter barely 50 feet above the ground , sweeping slowly back and forth in front of a cluster of lodgepole pine . More surprising still is the man in an orange jumpsuit hanging by a strap out the open door of the helicopter , peering down the barrel of a rifle . He seems to be struggling to get a bead on an animal scrambling through the snow , barely 40 feet ahead of the skids . The creature is dark gray , three feet high with long , powerful legs-a wolf . That 's not a hunter in the Jet Ranger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery for Yellowstone National Park . His rifle fires not bullets , but four-inch darts filled with a powerful tranquilizer . After another couple of minutes of dipping and swaying , the helicopter matching exactly the movements of the wolf , Dr. Smith takes careful aim , catches his breath and squeezes the trigger . The dart finds its mark . Four minutes later the wolf lies in the snow , safe and asleep . Dreaming of Wolves Doug Smith has been hard at work with wolves in Yellowstone for six years . But the animals have been a big part of his life since long before that . " I grew up in northern Ohio , " he says , " where my father owned a camp . As a boy I was outdoors almost every day-tramping through the woods , watching birds , turning over rocks to look for salamanders . " All that time outside helped create in Dr. Smith not just a fascination with animals , but a strong concern for how people treat them . " I knew early on I wanted to be a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice , " he recalls . " At about 12 years old , I started reading about wolves . I found out that they were persecuted , they were rare , they only lived in wilderness areas . " By the time he was 16 , Doug Smith was writing letters to Dave Mech , one of the most respected wolf researchers in the country , looking for ways to get involved . Two years later , as a senior in high school , he had his first of many volunteer jobs working with wolves . He could hardly have picked an animal more in need of a voice . Throughout history , all over the world , wolves have been shot , trapped and poisoned . Though at one time they were common throughout much of America , by 1964 their numbers had dwindled to fewer than 500 animals in the lower 48 states , most in northern Minnesota . The science of ecology tells us that you ca n't remove one piece ol nature 's puzzle without affecting the other pieces . As an example , Dr. Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticks , a small insect that carries Lyme disease , a danger to humans . " The reason there are so many deer ticks is because , with no predators around , we have record levels of deer . Those deer , in turn , are in many places over-browsing the plants . Once you lose the plants-things like aspen and willow-you also lose the songbirds that make their homes there . " The wolves of Yellowstone are teaching us much the same lesson . Wolves help keep elk numbers in check . They prompt elk to move , which keeps them from overgrazing the plants that grow along streams and rivers . The remains of the animals that wolves kill for food provide dinner for a variety of other creatures . Beetles feed on wolf kills , as do grizzlies , eagles and fox . Beyond all that , though , much of the appeal wolves have for Dr. Smith is simply their wildness . " There are few things in the world that we will never conquer , " he says . " Skunks , coyotes , red fox-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we ca n't make wolves live with us by turning them into something else . They are truly a symbol of all things wild . " While the Wolf Is Sleeping Photograph The gray wolf , or timber wolf , is native to the Yellowstone area . But populations were wiped out in the 1930 's . Doug Smith is making sure that does n't happen again . // Back in the field , the helicopter sets Dr. Smith down 100 yards from the darted wolf-a large female , weighing about 130 pounds . The biologist 's first priority is to track the animal 's health . That includes taking its pulse and checking its breathing . Body temperature is especially important . Wolves build up a lot of heat while running ; unlike humans , they do n't sweat , but rather cool themselves by panting . Since this wolf ca n't pant when it 's tranquilized , Dr. Smith will position it so that much of its body is in contact with the snow , packing snow around the chest and groin if necessary . This is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter . After taking blood samples-in part to check for disease , but also to establish a genetic record for the pack-Doug fits the wolf with a collar that transmits a radio signal . " With a radio collar you can find the wolf , and if you can find it , you can study it . Just as important , you can make management decisions based on solid data . " The idea is to collar at least one of the pack leaders , known as the alpha male and the alpha female . Collared alpha females will allow researchers to locate den sites in spring . Some of the pups are collared , too , because at some point they will form new packs . From 31 Canadian wolves released in Yellowstone during 1995 and 1996 , today there are approximately 160 wolves living in the park . Some biologists consider this to be the most successful conservation effort in American history . Creatures Great and Small Doug Smith says we should n't stop there . " It 's true that we should care about wolves , " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about everything else in nature . " Those people are the wildlife biologists of the future . It is a highly competitive field for highly motivated people . Dr. Smith tells of a conversation he had years ago with noted wolf researcher Durward Allen . Dr. Smith commented to Dr. Allen about how wildlife biologists seemed to be everywhere . " You 're right , " Dr. Allen told him . " But wildlife scientists are not . " Dr. Smith knows the secret to being such a scientist . Be more than interested in the work ; be passionate about it . The days are long , the pay modest . Then again , sitting here in this great sweep of wild Yellowstone , bundled against the cold beside a magnificent creature like this female wolf , Doug Smith can hardly imagine how a day on the job could be any more fun .
