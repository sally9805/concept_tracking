Markin ' Up the Score // Lou Levy , top man of Leeds Music Publishing company , took me up in a taxi to the Pythian Temple on West 70th Street to show me the pocket sized recording studio where Bill Haley and His Comets had recorded " Rock Around the Clock " - then down to Jack Dempsey 's restaurant on 58th and Broadway , where we sat down in a red leather upholstered booth facing the front window . // Lou introduced me to Jack Dempsey , the great boxer . Jack shook his fist at me. // " You look too light for a heavyweight kid , you 'll have to put on a few pounds . You 're gon na have to dress a little finer , look a little sharper - not that you 'll need much in the way of clothes when you 're in the ring - do n't be afraid of hitting somebody too hard . " // " He 's not a boxer , Jack , he 's a songwriter and we 'll be publishing his songs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ' em some of these days . Good luck to you , kid . " // Outside the wind was blowing , straggling cloud wisps , snow whirling in the red lanterned streets , city types scuffling around , bundled up - salesmen in rabbit fur earmuffs hawking gimmicks , chestnut vendors , steam rising out of manholes. // None of it seemed important . I had just signed a contract with Leeds Music giving it the right to publish my songs , not that there was any great deal to hammer out . I had n't written much yet . Lou had advanced me a hundred dollars against future royalties to sign the paper and that was fine with me. // John Hammond , who had brought me to Columbia Records , had taken me over to see Lou , asked him to look after me . Hammond had only heard two of my original compositions , but he had a premonition that there would be more . // Back at Lou 's office , I opened my guitar case , took the guitar out and began fingering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music stacked up , recording dates of artists posted on bulletin boards , black lacquered discs , acetates with white labels scrambled around , signed photos of entertainers , glossy portraits - Jerry Vale , Al Martino , The Andrews Sisters ( Lou was married to one of them ) , Nat King Cole , Patti Page , The Crew Cuts - a couple of console reel-to-reel tape recorders , big dark brown wooden desk full of hodgepodge . Lou had put a microphone on the desk in front of me and plugged the cord into one of the tape recorders , all the while chomping on a big exotic stogie. // " John 's got high hopes for you , " Lou said . // John was John Hammond , the great talent scout and discoverer of monumental artists , imposing figures in the history of recorded music - Billie Holiday , Teddy Wilson , Charlie Christian , Cab Calloway , Benny Goodman , Count Basie , Lionel Hampton . Artists who had created music that resonated through American life . He had brought it all to the public eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bessie Smith . He was legendary , pure American aristocracy . His mother was an original Vanderbilt , and John had been raised in the upper world , in comfort and ease - but he was n't satisfied and had followed his own heart 's love , music , preferably the ringing rhythm of hot jazz , spirituals and blues - which he endorsed and defended with his life . No one could block his way , and he did n't have time to waste . I could hardly believe myself awake when sitting in his office , him signing me to Columbia Records was so unbelievable . It would have sounded like a made-up thing . // Columbia was one of the first and foremost labels in the country and for me to even get my foot in the door was serious . For starters , folk music was considered junky , second rate and only released on small labels . Big-time record companies were strictly for the elite , for music that was sanitized and pasteurized . Someone like myself would never be allowed in except under extraordinary circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make schoolboy records or record schoolboy artists . He had vision and foresight , had seen and heard me , felt my thoughts and had faith in the things to come . He explained that he saw me as someone in the long line of a tradition , the tradition of blues , jazz and folk and not as some newfangled wunderkind on the cutting edge . Not that there was any cutting edge . Things were pretty sleepy on the Americana music scene in the late ' 50s and early ' 60s . Popular radio was sort of at a standstill and filled with empty pleasantries . It was years before The Beatles , The Who or The Rolling Stones would breathe new life and excitement into it . What I was playing at the time were hard-lipped folk songs with fire and brimstone servings , and you did n't need to take polls to know that they did n't match up with anything on the radio , did n't lend themselves to commercialism , but John told me that these things were n't high on his list and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I understand sincerity , " is what he said . John spoke with a rough , coarse attitude , yet had an appreciative twinkle in his eye . // Recently he had brought Pete Seeger to the label . He did n't discover Pete , though . Pete had been around for years . He 'd been in the popular folk group The Weavers , but had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era and had a hard time , but he never stopped working . Hammond was defiant when he spoke about Seeger , that Pete 's ancestors had come over on the Mayflower , that his relatives had fought the Battle of Bunker Hill , for Christsake . " Can you imagine those sons of bitches blacklisting him ? They should be tarred and feathered . " // " I 'm gon na give you all the facts , " he said to me . " You 're a talented young man . If you can focus and control that talent , you 'll be fine . I 'm gon na bring you in and I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // And that was good enough for me . He put a contract in front of me , the standard one , and I signed it right then and there , did n't get absorbed into details - did n't need a lawyer , advisor or anybody looking over my shoulder . I would have gladly signed whatever form he put in front of me. // He looked at the calendar , picked out a date for me to start recording , pointed to it and circled it , told me what time to come in and to think about what I wanted to play . Then he called in Billy James , the head of publicity at the label , told Billy to write some promo stuff on me , personal stuff for a press release . // Billy dressed Ivy League like he could have come out of Yale - medium height , crisp black hair . He looked like he 'd never been stoned a day in his life , never been in any kind of trouble . I strolled into his office , sat down opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cough up some facts , like I was supposed to give them to him straight and square . He took out a notepad and pencil and asked me where I was from . I told him I was from Illinois and he wrote it down . He asked me if I ever did any other work and I told him that I had a dozen jobs , drove a bakery truck once . He wrote that down and asked me if there was anything else . I said I 'd worked construction and he asked me where . // " Detroit . " // " You traveled around ? " // " Yep . " // He asked me about my family , where they were . I told him I had no idea , that they were long gone . // " What was your home life like ? " // I told him I 'd been kicked out . // " What did your father do ? " // " ' lectrician. " // " And your mother , what about her ? " // " Housewife . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " Folk music . " // " What kind of music is folk music ? " // I told him it was handed down songs . I hated these kind of questions . Felt I could ignore them . Billy seemed unsure of me and that was just fine . I did n't feel like answering his questions anyway , did n't feel the need to explain anything to anybody . // " How did you get here ? " he asked me. // " I rode a freight train . " // " You mean a passenger train ? " // " No , a freight train . " // " You mean , like a boxcar ? " // " Yeah , like a boxcar . Like a freight train . " // " Okay , a freight train . " // I gazed past Billy , past his chair through his window across the street to an office building where I could see a blazing secretary soaked up in the spirit of something - she was scribbling busy , occupied at a desk in a meditative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished I had a telescope . Billy asked me who I saw myself like in today 's music scene . I told him , nobody . That part of things was true , I really did n't see myself like anybody . The rest of it , though , was pure hokum - hophead talk . // I had n't come in on a freight train at all . What I did was come across the country from the Midwest in a four-door sedan , ' 57 Impala - straight out of Chicago , clearing the hell out of there - racing all the way through the smoky towns , winding roads , green fields covered with snow , onward , eastbound through the state lines , Ohio , Indiana , Pennsylvania , a twenty-four-hour ride , dozing most of the way in the backseat , making small talk . My mind fixed on hidden interests ... eventually riding over the George Washington Bridge . // The big car came to a full stop on the other side and let me out . I slammed the door shut behind me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The biting wind hit me in the face . At last I was here , in New York City , a city like a web too intricate to understand and I was n't going to try . // I was there to find singers , the ones I 'd heard on record - Dave Van Ronk , Peggy Seeger , Ed McCurdy , Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry , Josh White , The New Lost City Ramblers , Reverend Gary Davis and a bunch of others - most of all to find Woody Guthrie . New York City , the city that would come to shape my destiny . Modern Gomorrah . I was at the initiation point of square one but in no sense a neophyte. // When I arrived , it was dead-on winter . The cold was brutal and every artery of the city was snowpacked , but I 'd started out from the frostbitten North Country , a little corner of the earth where the dark frozen woods and icy roads did n't faze me . I could transcend the limitations . It was n't money or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heightened sense of awareness , was set in my ways , impractical and a visionary to boot . My mind was strong like a trap and I did n't need any guarantee of validity . I did n't know a single soul in this dark freezing metropolis but that was all about to change - and quick . // The Caf ? Wha ? was a club on MacDougal Street in the heart of Greenwich Village . The place was a subterranean cavern , liquorless , ill lit , low ceiling , like a wide dining hall with chairs and tables - opened at noon , closed at four in the morning . Somebody had told me to go there and ask for a singer named Freddy Neil who ran the daytime show at the Wha ? // I found the place and was told that Freddy was downstairs in the basement where the coats and hats were checked and that 's where I met him . Neil was the MC of the room and the maestro in charge of all the entertainers . He could n't have been nicer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sang , played guitar and harmonica . He asked me to play something . After about a minute , he said I could play harmonica with him during his sets . I was ecstatic . At least it was a place to stay out of the cold . This was good . // Fred played for about twenty minutes and then introduced all the rest of the acts , then came back up to play whenever he felt like it , whenever the joint was packed . The acts were disjointed , awkward and seemed to have come from the Ted Mack Amateur Hour , a popular TV show . The audience was mostly collegiate types , suburbanites , lunch-hour secretaries , sailors and tourists . Everybody performed from ten to fifteen minutes . Fred would play for however long he felt , however long the inspiration would last . Freddy had the flow , dressed conservatively , sullen and brooding , with an enigmatical gaze , peachlike complexion , hair splashed with curls and an angry and powerful baritone voice that struck blue notes and blasted them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor of the place , even had his own harem , his devotees . You could n't touch him . Everything revolved around him . Years later , Freddy would write the hit song " Everybody 's Talkin ' . " I never played any of my own sets . I just accompanied Neil on all of his and that 's where I began playing regular in New York . // The daytime show at the Caf ? Wha ? , an extravaganza of patchwork , featured anybody and anything - a comedian , a ventriloquist , a steel drum group , a poet , a female impersonator , a duo who sang Broadway stuff , a rabbit-in-the-hat magician , a guy wearing a turban who hypnotized people in the audience , somebody whose entire act was facial acrobatics - just anybody who wanted to break into show business . Nothing that would change your view of the world . I would n't have wanted Fred 's gig for anything . // At about eight o'clock , the whole daytime menagerie would come to a halt and then the professional show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joan Rivers , Lenny Bruce and commercial folksinging groups like The Journeymen would command the stage . Everyone who had been there during the day would pack up . One of the guys who played in the afternoons was the falsetto-speaking Tiny Tim . He played ukulele and sang like a girl - old standard songs from the ' 20s . I got to talking to him a few times and asked him what other kinds of places there were to work around here and he told me that sometimes he played at a place in Times Square called Hubert 's Flea Circus Museum . I 'd find out about that place later . // Fred was constantly being pestered and pressured by moocher types who wanted to play or perform one thing or another . The saddest character of all was a guy named Billy the Butcher . He looked like he came out of nightmare alley . He only played one song - " High-Heel Sneakers " and he was addicted to it like a drug . Fred would usually let him play it sometime during the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always preface his song by saying " This is for all you chicks . " The Butcher wore an overcoat that was too small for him , buttoned tight across the chest . He was jittery and sometime in the past he 'd been in a straitjacket in Bellevue , also had burned a mattress in a jail cell . All kinds of bad things had happened to Billy . There was a fire between him and everybody else . He sang that one song pretty good , though . // Another popular guy wore a priest 's outfit and red-topped boots with little bells and did warped takes on stories from the Bible . Moondog also performed down here . Moondog was a blind poet who lived mostly on the streets . He wore a Viking helmet and a blanket with high fur boots . Moondog did monologues , played bamboo pipes and whistles . Most of the time he performed on 42nd Street . // My favorite singer in the place was Karen Dalton . She was a tall white blues singer and guitar player , funky , lanky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run across her the previous summer outside of Denver in a mountain pass town in a folk club . //
