View all 110 of Messier 's deep-sky wonders in a single evening . Photograph French comet hunter Charles Messier started his catalog after chancing upon this object on the night of August 28,1758 . Commonly referred to as the Crab Nebula , this supernova remnant is also well known by its Messier catalog designation , M1. // HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED what it would be like to find all 110 of Charles Messier 's famous deep-sky objects ? How about in a single night ? If you have , then a Messier Marathon might be just the astronomical ticket for you . March is the only time of year when you may be able to catch them all if you are willing to stay up from dusk to dawn . This is possible because there is only one Messier object ( M52 , which is circumpolar for much of the Northern Hemisphere ) in the swath of sky between right ascension 21sup h 40sup m and 0sup h 40sup m , a region spanning 450 . In mid-March , the Sun is neatly parked in this Messier gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers around the world participate in Messier Marathons . This year 's prime window of opportunity will be the relatively Moon-free weekend of March 31st-April Ist . A less favorable opportunity will be available on the March 10th-I Ith weekend . The modern Messier catalog is actually an assemblage of several different lists . Messier 's original list contained only 45 objects and concludes with M45 , the Pleiades . The standard Messier catalog ends with M103 , an open cluster in Cassiopeia . This is still regarded as the " real " Messier list by many purists . Another seven objects that Messier knew about , but may not have observed , were added to the list at various times in this century . Since M102 turns out to be a duplicate observation of M101 , the large face  --  on galaxy in Ursa Major , many listings substitute NGC 5866 , a pretty edge-on spiral in nearby Draco , to top up the list to an even 110 objects . So before setting out on your marathon , define your goals . Are you going for 45 , 103 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " right " answer - just be sure to make up your mind before marathon night . Equipment Matters Almost any telescope will do for a Messier Marathon . However , the larger the aperture , the better your chances are of bagging all 110 objects . A 6-inch reflector is plenty@ but if you have an 8- to 10-inch scope , you are going to have an easier time of it . On the other hand , if all you have is a small refractor ( in the 60- to 80-millimeter range ) you might be surprised at how many objects you can see . It has been suggested that Messier never observed with an instrument having a greater light grasp than a modern 80-mm refractor . At one of our recent club Messier Marathons , a young woman showed up with such an instrument and went away having seen 41 objects - not bad for a first-timer ! Remember , the idea is to have fim , and you can do that even if you observe only a fraction of Messier 's list . A Messier Marathon is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object study but object identification . Once you have located a particular object , move on to the next one - you have to find one every six minutes ! Plan accordingly . In this kind of hunt , a telescope with an equatorial mount can actually be a hindrance . It 's too complicated . Altazimuth mounts , like the ubiquitous Dobsonian , are simpler and will enable you to move more quickly from target to target . This becomes increasingly important later in the evening when you are tired and prone to making mistakes . Since the marathon is really a test of your ability to locate objects , computer-assisted telescopes are of little use . Of course you can still use the scope itself , just keep the electronics switched off . // Sky &; Telescope Messier Marathon Checklist // In addition to having the right gear , you will also need an observing spot with unobstructed east and west horizons . At the beginning and end of the marathon , you 're really going to be racing against the clock . A low horizon can buy you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Messiers and getting them all . Problem Objects Several Messier objects present challenges . Most of these are not particularly difficult under normal conditions ; rather , it 's their placement in the March sky that makes them so . Bagging all 110 Messier objects will often hinge on just five targets - four have to be logged in the early evening before they set , and one in the morning as twilight reclaims the sky . M74 . This low-surface-brightness galaxy in Pisces leads off your evening and is one of the two hardest objects in the entire marathon . It is difficult even under good conditions . Your best defense against this notorious object is to learn to locate it in the winter months , when it is better positioned . Depending on conditions and your location , M74 may be impossible on marathon night . Observers at midnorthern latitudes will have the best shot at this difficult galaxy . M77 . Small and concentrated , this galaxy is the opposite of big , diffuse M74 . It 's one of the few objects of the evening that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a star in a dewed-over eyepiece but is somewhat easier than M74 . M72 and M73 . These two tiny and unimpressive Messier objects lie right next to each other in Aquarius and can be very hard to locate in twilight . Key on the 3.8-magnitude star Epsilon ( F- ) Aquarii 3.3 deg to the north-northwest . M30 . The final object in the marathon is this small globular cluster in Capricornus . Inevitably , it must be viewed in bright morning twilight . Indeed , depending on the time of month and your latitude , M30 may elude you - the further south you are located , the better your chances will be . To have any hope of bagging it , you need to memorize its position during the winter months , when it is better placed . The Virgo Cluster . Of all the sections of the marathon , none strikes fear into the heart of the beginning observer quite like the cluster of galaxies residing in the stretch of sky between Denebola in Leo and Vindemiatrix in Virgo . Yet , with some practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence . A detailed star chart is a big help here . The special Virgo Galaxy Cluster map in the second edition of SkyAtlas 2000 is especially good . It is imperative that you do your homework and find these objects before marathon night - learning the Virgo Cluster on the job will leave you physically and mentally exhausted . I generally start with the galaxies M59 and M60 and work my way westward . Whichever route you choose , be consistent ; pick one and practice it over and over until you can do it more or less from memory . The Big Night Like a runner preparing for a marathon race , you have to make sure you 're in good shape for the big event . Get plenty of rest beforehand , eat light , and drink plenty of fluids throughout the evening . In the early morning hours after the Virgo Cluster , there is a lull of several hours before Scorpius and Sagittarius rise . Some people are energized after a short nap , while others drift off into never-never land and just do n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , take a cue from seasoned observers and bring some kind of chair . Those models specifically designed for use at the telescope and featuring adjustable seat height work best , but just about any chair will help your endurance . Photograph The modern Messier catalog comprises 110 objects spread across the sky . As a cursory glance at this map shows , Messier 's clusters , nebulae , and galaxies are not evenly distributed - there is a dense concentration of galaxies in the Virgo/Leo region , while the strip of sky featuring the summer Milky Way is chock full of star clusters . The gaps between these Messier crowds provide marathoners with opportunities for a quick breather . // As in any race , the key is knowing how to pace yourself . There are stretches where you have to sprint with all your energy , and other sections of the marathon where you can slow down a bit and enjoy the scenery . Here 's the plan . Early Evening : A Hectic Start As twilight fades , the Messier Marathon starts off with a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to find so many objects in so little time . What 's more , two of the most difficult objects ( M74 and M77 ) must be located in twilight low in the west . Take a good look for them , but if they do n't show , move on - there 's too much else to see in this part of the sky and time is short . Work methodically and do n't forget to seek out every object in a Messier clump before moving on . For example , when you find M31 , do n't leave until you also see the two companions , M32 and M 110 . Similarly , once you start the Canis Major/Puppis group of open clusters , stay in the vicinity until you get them all . Generally , you will move west to east and south to north . Work quickly . If you bag M74 and M77 , most of the rest should be easy prey . Leo and the Big Dipper Region : Seeing Double There are a number of confusing double objects in this segment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to identify both objects for either to count ! M81/M82 . M81 is rounder and brighter than M82 . M65/M66 . M66 is smaller and brighter than M65 . M95/M96 . M96 is bigger and brighter ( M95 can be difficult ) . M97/MI08 . M97 is a round planetary nebula ; M108 is an edge-on galaxy . M105 . There are two other galaxies in the same field of view . NGC 3384 is nearly as bright as M105 , and NGC 3389 is dimmer but also very close . M105 is the biggest object in the field . M40 is an oddity . It 's a double star near Megrez in the Big Dipper . I list it as " difficult " because it is easy to overlook if you have n't seen it before . Also , if you 're going for 110 objects in your marathon , do n't forget to pick up NGC 5866 in Draco as your M102 . It 's a pretty galaxy and well worth a look . Those with poor southern horizons should get M68 and M83 as soon as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern sky , they can rise and set before you know it . Once you 've completed this segment , you 're technically almost halfway through the marathon . Take a short rest ; have a snack and a drink - you 've earned it . The Virgo Cluster Region In a region of the sky about the size of your outstretched hand is the Virgo Galaxy Cluster , home to 16 Messier objects . If you 've taken my advice and done your homework beforehand , the " Virgo Clutter " wo n't present much difficulty . Otherwise , batten down the hatches and do your best , beginning with M59 and M60 . Got them all ? Good . Relax - the pace slows down from here . After Midnight : Cygnus and Ophiuchus After the excitement of the Virgo Cluster , the Messier Marathon settles into a slow , sleepy pace that does n't pick up again until later on , when Scorpius clears the eastern horizon . Your major enemy at this point is n't the marathon itself- , it 's fatigue and boredom . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginners find the more elusive objects . You can spot the firsttimers by their scopes - usually pointed due west as they try desperately to catch up while objects sink into the west . On the other hand , if you 're a beginner yourself , get help from someone who has a telescope pointed eastward , waiting for objects to rise . ( Do n't laugh - this really works ! ) There 's no reason why everyone should n't be caught up by 3 a.m. or so . Enjoy the lull ; this is the calm before the storm . Things are about to get a lot more hectic . Scorpius and Sagittarius Region First , the bad news : You need to locate 24 objects while you 're tired . The good news ? Almost all of them are easy , and many are showpieces - with luck , you will be awake enough to appreciate this fact . You can follow the order of the checklist or start in the south at M7 and work your way north , back and forth in large sweeps until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers and far enough away from bright stars to make them comparatively difficult . I have a particularly hard time with M55 and M75 from my location . However , if you have a good southern horizon and dark skies , even these should prove easy . Early Dawn:The Finish Line Near the end of the previous segment , you probably noticed the eastern sky beginning to brighten . None of the objects in this segment is really difficult under normal circumstances . However , having to locate them in predawn light while fatigued is a challenge . Note that , from some locations , M30 may not be possible to locate at all . On marathon night you may see all 110 or perhaps fewer than half that number . In any case , the object of the exercise is to have fun . So grab your charts and recharge those flashlights - it 's time to go marathoning !
