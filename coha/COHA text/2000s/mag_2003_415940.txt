It 's not hard to spot him on the mountain : Neil 's red patrol jacket trails so many threads it looks fringed , his mismatched poles are triaged with athletic tape , and his ancient green down vest exhales feathers at the apex of every turn . Combine this attire with Neil 's bushy ginger sideburns and wind-scoured cheeks that crowd laughing blue eyes , and the man looks like a leprechaun stripped of his pot of gold . One day last March I tailed Neil , 49 , as he made his usual rounds of Lake Louise 's front side , an aristocratic playground where Hollywood celebrities and British royalty saunter down myriad green runs . For several hours we cruised over freshly combed groomers , spinning CLOSED signs to OPEN , dispensing directions to the day lodge , and picking up and brushing off wealthy Texans who 'd tweaked their knees on runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , Dullsville . For a little excitement , I was hoping the gentility police might bust Neil . His crime : wearing second-hand Vlkls and a neck warmer the color of dishwater in a place where gold-monogrammed one-pieces seem standard issue . Neil was oblivious to the contrast , and despite the fact that he may have been the best skier on the mountain , he wound down the groomers the way an old cop steers his Crown Vic around town . On the lifts , our conversation was a looping affair that swung from Sufi mysticism to cybernetic theory to the virtues of Swix Silver wax . Neil revealed his ski-bum tendencies : He did not own a telephone . He did not own a car . He lived in a spartan apartment . ( A friend of his had advised me before meeting Neil , " If you put all his possessions in a pile , you 'd probably get arrested for littering . " ) During the off-seasons Neil had ridden more than 70,000 miles on his 1978 road bike . He had been covered in bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outback . He was even an amateur philosopher . " Humans use four or five different methods of analyzing , eh ? " he asked rhetorically while explaining the merits of transcendentalism . All of this confused me . Neil was obviously a man after adventure , so why was he spending his winters on the mellow groomers of Lake Louise ? I got my answer later that afternoon when we finally took the Summit Platter chair to the top of Mount Whitehorn . For the first time I saw Louise 's hidden back side . Three dozen expert runs cascaded off the meandering ridgeline : ski-anywhere cirques , cornice plunges , and couloirs pinched by cheese-grater rock bands . Then Neil led me over to the boundary tape and pointed . It 's all national park land , he explained , and the terrain is open to anyone who wants to explore it . Around us wrapped Banff 's jawbone of peaks , and a horizon of backcountry ski bowls and couloirs . There was n't a thing mellow about it . " What makes this place so great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have to make your own decisions . " Tapping my own inner philosopher , I decided that I 'd seen enough of the front side . Until March I 'd never visited Lake Louise , but I had a mental Polaroid on file : The grand Canadian Rockies skirted in mist like a Bierstadt mural ; the proud Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise on the shore of its namesake turquoise lake ; the ski area seven miles across the valley with its Milquetoast offerings and paltry 139 inches of average annual snowfall . Louise had always seemed the alpine equivalent of a swank country club with an easy 18 . Then I started hearing about guys like Neil : diehard-yet-quirky locals who neither floated through life on a diet of brie and Bordeaux nor spent any personal time on the ski area 's front-side greens . Though it was hard to imagine anyone quite like Neil ( few people on earth still raid the backcountry on a pair of 1982 , 210-cm Kazamas ) , Lake Louise supposedly housed plenty of other serious skiers who 'd uncovered seasons ' worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibility . And then I heard it was possible to enjoy LL 's high life on the cheap . A local hostel built like an old national park lodge was rumored to offer yoga at dawn , poached salmon in the caf , and a $20-a-night price tag . Considering the struggling Canadian dollar , all of this was enough to make me ignore my mother 's inadvertent warning . " You 'll love Lake Louise , dear , " she said on the phone before I left . " You know , your grandmother used to vacation there . " A couple days later I steered up the long drive to the Chateau for a two-night stay in luxury . ( If you 're gon na confront the myth , you got ta face it head-on , right ? ) A century ago , even before the larger hotel was built , no fewer than 10 trains a day in summer disgorged viscounts and the haute bourgeoisie in the Bow Valley . Ladies painted watercolors on the shore while striplings in pinafores threw rocks into the lake named for Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onetime owner of the ski hill and the eccentric son of an English margarine baron , spent years trying to transform Lake Louise into the " Engadin of the New World "  --  complete with brown cows , a string of backcountry huts for the well-heeled skier , and imported Swiss peasants . In some ways , little has changed . When I arrived at the Chateau , two young men in Alpine hats and loden knickers greeted me at the door and vanished with my baggage . A third whisked away the car . Inside , the Chateau had the bustling elegance of a European grand hotel  --  487 rooms , 650 employees , six restaurants , and a host of smaller lounges and eateries . From the entryway I looked across the valley and saw the ski area 's broad south face , a sunny tangle of well-cared-for blue runs just steep enough to quicken the middle-aged pulse . When the bellboy learned that I was here to ski , he let loose with stories about his typical , less-than-mountain-folk guests . There was the group of blue hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise at dinner , lest the distant Victoria Glacier calve and send a " Poseidon Adventure " tidal wave through the hotel . Then there was the well-to-do European who asked where all the bears were kept during the winter . Sleeping on the seventh floor , an employee told him , but you must come back in spring to see them . The man did ; the employee was fired . My own perceptions of Lake Louise changed after I met Neil and he pointed out the back-side riches . A day after that I hooked up with another local for a guided tour . Thirty-eight-year-old Yves Drouin is a senior waiter at the Post Hotel , a discreet but ultraswank , 97-room lodge with an acclaimed restaurant and a 30,000-bottle wine cellar . By night , Yves helps deconstruct the bouquet of $900 bottles of La Tache for the restaurant 's A-list guests ; by day , he is a freelance ski instructor for software moguls and other bigwigs ( that week it was The New Yorker 's literary editor ) . With his crisp , Euro-style ski outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly appeared different from his wealthy students . But like most locals , off the clock he quickly dropped his patience for the tourists . " Some people , I 'm teaching them the same freakin ' thing for seven years , " he ranted as we got on the Summit Platter . " I can teach the tight-assed , proper technical turns , but I like to do the full-on , hard skiing . " As we reached the top of 8,765-foot Mount Whitehorn , he laid down his guidelines . " The rule here is if most people go right , you go left . " In other words , lose the crowd and you 'll find slopes where the tea-takers fear to snowplow . He followed Rule Number One with Rule Number Two , which I was already familiar with : " You only want to ski the back side . " Then he shoved off . I chased after him  --  first down a bumped ridgeline , then down one of the eight gullies that comprise the headwall called Whitehorn 2 . The mountain dropped , bulged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This side of the mountain , Yves later explained , is sheltered from both prevailing winds and sun . Storms carry snow from elsewhere and dump it here , sometimes tripling the accumulation of the front side . Goodbye , Dullsville . When we finished that run , Yves showed me the locals ' lap : up the back side 's Paradise Chair , followed by a flying groomer down the front to the Summit Platter , then over to the back side for a drop into a different treeless chute off Whitehorn 's summit , or perhaps a left hook to Brown Shirt , a less visited line with a punctuating cliff band . Later , we skirted big bumps on the edge of Paradise Bowl and dropped into Pika Trees , a pinball forest so tight I was brushing bark off my shoulders . Each back-side run was eerily empty save for a few visitors who stuck dogmatically to the four blue and green runs that guided them to the cat track and safety . Off piste was the locals ' haunt : When we stopped on Whitehorn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heckling Yves for his lollygagging . Yves had paused to point out Louise 's other stash  --  the hikeable 8,902-foot Lipalian Mountain , home to the broad chest of Purple Bowl , the terrain used annually in the Canadian Powder 8 Champion-ships . ( Unfortunately , we could only gawk ; some of the worst snow stability in decades meant skiing the backcountry was a death wish . ) Between runs , Yves emerged as every bit the soul-skiing mountain freak Neil was . Sure , Neil stuck to the spartan way of life while Yves was n't afraid of taking advantage of his privileged pupils : He told me about some pharmaceutical reps who took him heli-skiing the previous week and about another client 's million-dollar house in Portugal where Yves planned to spend part of the summer . But like Neil , Yves had a respectable dedication to his sport . He was on the mountain every day  --  130 days the previous winter . " I live two stop signs from fresh tracks , " he said . " I bought my SUV automatic so I could drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Yves , too , waxed philosophical . " I like the simplicity of Lake Louise , " he said at lunch that day as he surveyed the slopes and the valley below . " It 's kind of pure to the eye all the time . It 's pristine , and quiet . There are more trees than people . Last night , after work , did you see Orion lined up with the glacier ? It was just ... pristine . " Lake Louise may not be a hotbed of transcendental insight , but I let his half-baked rumination slide . The place is ... pristine . My remaining days at Lake Louise were a similar mix of high and low tastes  --  filet mignon of bison dipped in boiling fondue oil at the Chateau 's wood-paneled Walliser Stube , followed by shepherd 's pie at the locals ' bargain hangout , the Outpost Pub , and a bunk at the Alpine Centre Hostel ( all rumors  --  yoga , salmon  --  were true ) . Late night , when the rest of the valley slept , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " n " dirties "  --  Newfoundland Screech dark rum and Coke  --  and each day revealed another surprise on the mountain . I sampled Lake Louise 's massive terrain park , followed a Chateau maitre d ' into mellow OB stashes like Maintenance , and , on a clear day after a storm , found fresh tracks  --  at 1 P.M. !  --  in Kiddie 's Corner . On my last morning I headed up Louise 's old , creaky Eagle chair with Neil , who revealed his favorite LL secret : A couple nights each week , after the lifts closed , instead of returning to the phoneless home he rented in Banff , he skied into the woods to an illicit bivouac he would only coyly acknowledge . In the mornings he 'd have backcountry powder all to himself . " Thirty-two below just last week , " he told me , after some prodding . " I wore nine layers that night . " Then he told me about the book he was working on . " It 's about how you can think about the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's another knowledge out there . " Apparently , those frigid nights in the woods brought him closer to his subject . " As Thoreau has said , you can not be a good naturalist and have a roof over your head . The sky needs to be your roof . " This summer , he pronounced , he was planning to finish his metaphysic research at his Quebec birthplace , adding to the woo-woo knowledge he 'd gleaned from bike trips through the Great Plains , Sumatra , and Australia . Then the adventurer will return to Lake Louise . " We can come and go , live a very simple life , " Neil said , pointing down at the valley , where the Chateau looked like a toy someone had placed at the foot of the Rockies . " You can still be a philosopher and be here . " Maybe . But you can definitely be a rippin ' skier . Illustration COLOR PHOTO : PHOTOGRAPHY BY CHASE JARVIS Yves Drouin gets deep at Lake Louise .
