Years ago , I went to a seminar on stress reduction at the Y. Most of what the instructor told us struck me as either obvious ( make lists of what you have to do and check off what you 've accomplished ) or embarrassing ( a series of breathing exercises that made me think of Lamaze class ) , but there was one thing he said that made the whole class worthwhile , a trick I still use when I find myself getting overwhelmed : He told us we should visualize a place where we felt completely safe and peaceful . He said it did n't make any difference if it was someplace we knew well or someplace we 'd only dreamed about , but that we should think about it in great detail , notice everything around us , memorize all the sights and the sounds . Then he instructed us to go to this place in our minds . I glanced quickly around the room . Everyone had closed their eyes and gone to their childhood bedroom or a beach in Jamaica or wherever life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to go . I felt embarrassed sitting in my folding chair , as if the people around me would know that I was still in the conference hall while they were all walking down a white sand beach with the sun glinting off their hair . I ran over a quick mental list : the house on Lake Placid we rented one summer ; my own back porch ; Paris , where I 've never been but would like to someday go . None of them seemed right , they all seemed to be asking too little or too much . But when I finally closed my eyes and tried , what I wanted came to me with complete clarity . The place that I went , the place that I still go , was the warm , hollowed-out center of a Bundt cake . It is usually gingerbread , though sometimes that changes . Sometimes it'sgingerbread crowned in a ring of poached pears . The walls that surround me are high and soft , but as they go up they curve back , open up to the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . There are a few loose crumbs around my feet , clinging to my hair , and the smell ! The ginger and butter , the lingering subtlety of vanilla . . . I press my cheek against the cake , which is soft as eiderdown and still warm . This is n't a fantasy about food exactly , at least not insofar as I want to eat my way through a cake that 's taller than I am . It 's about being inside of cake , being part of something that I find to be profoundly comforting . The instructor told us to take another deep breath , and all around me I heard the smooth shush of air going in , waiting , coming out . I thought I might never open my eyes . Cakes have gotten a bad rap . People equate virtue with turning down dessert . There is always one person at the table who holds up her hand when I serve the cake . No , really , I could n't , she says , and then gives her flat stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork into that first tender layer looks at the person who declined the plate , and they all think , That person is better than I am . That person has discipline . But that is n't a person with discipline , that is a person who has completely lost touch with joy . A slice of cake never made anybody fat . You do n't eat the whole cake . You do n't eat a cake every day of your life . You take the cake when it is offered because the cake is delicious . You have a slice of cake and what it reminds you of is someplace that 's safe , uncomplicated , without stress . A cake is a party , a birthday , a wedding . A cake is what 's served on the happiest days of your life . This is a story of how my life was saved by cake , so , of course , if sides are to be taken , I will always take the side of cake . It 's a laugh to think that I was feeling stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feeling stressed about eight years ago ? My son , Wyatt , was twelve then , still a full year away from the gawky roller-coaster ride of his teenage years . He asked for help on his homework and introduced me to his friends when they came over to go sledding . Camille was a little girl who still crawled into my lap some nights after dinner and let me brush her hair . I called her Kitten . Camille is sixteen now and about as much a kitten as a lioness eating a half-living zebra on a scorching African veldt . Eight years ago , my mother still lived by herself in Michigan and only came to visit twice a year and sometimes not even that . My husband , Sam , was the hardest-working hospital administrator anyone could have imagined , if one was given to imagining such things . I remember it now and hang my head in disbelief . I want to go back to that person I was , take her by the shoulders and shake her . " Look again ! " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of paradise . " *** I arrived home in the rain , my arms filled with groceries . I tried to bring them all in at once , which was n't exactly possible , but the rain was beating down with such a biblical fury that I thought it would be smarter to make one incredibly challenging trip than three manageable trips . The paper bags , a foolish choice , were melting between my fingers . My keys were so far down in the bottom of my purse ( looped over the left wrist ) that they might as well have been in Liberia for all the chance I had of getting to them . Not that I was even sure the door was locked . It might have been unlocked . I could n't turn the doorknob unless I did it with my teeth . It was very clear that I had shown some poor judgment . I kicked at the door . Through the window I could see my daughter sitting at the kitchen table reading a magazine . At the second kick she raised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading at all but had been hypnotized by the magazine . There was a hard wall of rain between us and yet I could still make out the supreme disinterest in her gaze . It was a look I knew intimately . I kicked again . She tilted her head , not entirely sure why I was interrupting her : Clearly , there was the door , I was capable of opening a door ; I had keys if the door was , in fact , locked ; I could see her weighing all this out in her mind . I felt a critical shift in the balance of the groceries and kicked again , just to speed things along . She sighed , a sound so reverberant with weariness that it made its way across the room and past the door and through the rain to reach me . She lifted her slender frame , a willow , a willow leaf , shuffled to the door , and opened it . When that task had been completed she returned wordlessly to the table and resumed her reading . I pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fifth bag , sensing we had reached the threshold of safety , decided it could no longer bear the burden of its responsibility and split apart , sending tangerines and three packages of frozen spinach and a roll of paper towels and ( the kicker ) a large plastic bottle of cran-apple juice bouncing over the floor . Not the eggs , not the paper carton of milk , I did not lose sight of the ways in which I was fortunate . I sank to my knees and put the other bags down before they could follow suit . I was profoundly wet . I could not imagine that dolphins ever got this wet . " I could n't get to my keys , " I said . " It was n't locked , " Camille said , but she did n't look up . I got up off the floor and started to pick up what needed to be picked up . There was a great lake forming beneath me . " Ruth ? " My mother came into the kitchen holding a stack of papers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They seemed to be a natural extension of her hand . I imagined her sleeping with fistfuls of paper clutched to her chest . " I need you to look at these for me . I 've been over them a million times and they just do n't make any sense . Does it look like Blue Cross paid the doctor or does it look like I have to pay him ? I do n't want Dr. Nickerson to think I did n't pay him . " She was wearing a pink warm-up suit that appeared to have been ironed . She was looking at me , but I was n't sure that she saw me at all . If she had seen me she surely would have commented on the fact that I looked like I had just been dragged from the lake , that I was raising myself up from a fiery ring of tangerines . " I 'll go over them , Mother , but I just got in from the grocery store . I need to put these things away first . " I pushed back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face like seaweed . " Did you get the dried apricots ? " " Were they on the list ? " She closed her eyes for a minute . " I ca n't remember . I ca n't remember anything . " She turned to her granddaughter . " Camille , it 's a terrible thing to be old . I hope you never get to be my age . Or maybe by the time you get to be my age they will have invented a cure for forgetting things . " Camille made some small humming sound that acknowledged that she had heard her own name spoken but she did not stop reading . " I 'll put apricots on the list for next time , " I said . " And these papers . Will you look at these ? If I owe Dr. Nickerson money I think I should pay him . " I scooped up the sodden remains of paper sack and threw them in the garbage . I put myself inside the cake and tried to breathe slowly . I made it a simple lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my parents had been divorced since I was two . My mother had done everything on her own . She had taken good care of me , played rounds of Go Fish , cooked nutritious meals , sewed me clothes that never looked homemade , taught me to play the piano in a passable manner . This was payback time . " The mail has already gone out today . Just let me get the milk in the refrigerator . " " Camille , " my mother said . " Come over here and help your mother . We 'll get this done in a minute . " Camille closed her eyes and pushed her fingers against the slender bridge of her nose . I could tell she was trying not to scream , and even though I did n't expect her to have much success , I appreciated her minimal efforts at restraint . " When I came into the kitchen to read , there was nobody in here . If I were smart I would just stay in my bedroom until it was time to go to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow hip against the table , and was out of the room . My mother and I watched her , both of us frozen for a moment . It was n't as if we had n't seen it before , but it never ceased to be a surprise . " You never spoke to me like that , " my mother said quietly . " No , I do n't expect I did . " " I think I would have had a heart attack , " she said . But then she thought about it some more . " Or I would have killed you . One or the other . " " I think that 's right . " Sometimes I wanted to run after Camille and grab her . Where is Kitten ! I wanted to know . What have you done with my daughter ? " You and Sam need to do something about this . That girl has too many privileges . She talks on the phone all the time , goes out with her friends . She has a car ! " I wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can you allow a child to behave that way and let her have a car ? " " I do n't know , " I said honestly , because even though I was n't interested in hearing her point of view at the moment , it was not entirely without validity . My mother shook her head . " So the groceries can wait for two minutes . Come sit down and look at these forms . " And so I sat down , my raincoat still pooling water in its cuffs , my groceries on the floor . I fished my reading glasses out of the bottom of my purse . " You know , Sam is so much better with these things than I am . " I took the papers from her hands . " Sam 's so busy , " she said . " He runs a hospital all day . He should n't be bothered with medical papers as soon as he walks in the door . " But she would ask him . She always did . I would fill out the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ruth ! You 're getting those wet ! " She leaned over and blotted the papers with a paper napkin . " Ca n't you at least dry your hands first ? " On my mother 's behalf , I will say that the insurance forms were viciously confusing , and that after sitting there watching me read for a few minutes she did get up and start to put the groceries away , though she held up every other item and asked me where it went . " I thought so , " she 'd say , and then put the can of soup with the other cans of soup . My mother moved in with us a little more than a year ago after her house in East Lansing had been robbed in the middle of the day while she was playing bridge with friends . Whoever did it knocked down the front door . They did n't pick the lock or jimmy open a window , they just kicked the door in , smashed it to bits , and stepped inside . After that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door installed and waited to calm down . She went back to the hostess of the bridge party and stayed with her for a week , thinking the feeling of uneasiness would pass . When it did n't , she packed up what the burglars had deemed unfit to take , including her enormous collection of fabric remnants , and moved to Minneapolis to live with us . My mother had been a high school music teacher who went back to school to get her certification in history and geography when the state 's budget for music programs was cut back . She was practical because she had to be ; that was the hand life had dealt her and she did n't complain . A roast chicken showed up as chicken hash the next night and then chicken soup for the weekend . My father , whom she had met at a convention of Michigan high school music teachers during the two weeks he actually was a high school music teacher , played piano at clubs , bars , and wedding receptions , his engagements sending him out later and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed like too much trouble to make the trip home . This was the early nineteen fifties , when being a divorced woman with a child was still a cause for sideways glances from other women in the grocery store , but my mother kept her head up and trudged forward . I try to imagine sometimes how hard her life must have been . I know that our life together was hard enough , but children are remarkably adaptable creatures , and if there is little there they settle for little . But my mother was a young woman , working all day , giving private piano lessons in our house on the weekends and after school . Sometimes my father would blow into town , seeming relaxed and handsome and nearly famous , but he always blew out again , and while he may have left behind a box of macadamia brittle or a child 's coat that was already too small , he never left actual cash for the gas bill . When my mother finally retired , it looked like things were going to be fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons and collected a manageable pension from the school system . She had her friends , her bridge group , her music appreciation club . She even went on a package tour of Europe that Sam and I had given her for her birthday . I always saw her as one of those women who would have to be dragged out of her home by six policemen when she was ninety-eight . But then , what in life actually works out the way you think it 's going to ? I wish I could find the person , the people , who kicked in her door . I never have gotten over my need to tell them that they took too much . The television , the stereo , largely worthless jewelry , six pieces of family silver which included her mother 's butter dish that had come over with the family on the boat from Denmark , they could have all of it , but they should n't have kicked in the door . That was the thing that changed my mother for good . Divorce and hard work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to be seventy-three years old and know that someone can just kick in your door , that they do n't even have to have enough finesse to force the lock , really destroyed her sense of how the world was ordered . It scared her , my mother , who had always been such a brave person . Even after it was long over it left her unsure of things . Now she was living in what was once my guest room and lacked the certainty to fill out consumer questionnaires without my going over them with her . " Oh , Ruth , " my mother said , looking over my shoulder while I tried to wrestle Blue Cross Blue Shield to the ground . " I do n't know what I 'd do without you . " " I think that 's got it . " Not that it mattered . Sam would check it . I pushed back from the table . The kitchen floor had only the lightest sheen of water left on it . My hair was half dry . " I should get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch and I saw a familiar cloud of hesitancy and desire pass over her face . " Oprah 's on , " I said . My mother was a fool for Oprah . " Go . " " I can help you . " I shook my head . " Dinner 's a piece of cake . I 'll be fine . " My mother headed off to the den and I was glad . I would take a moment by myself over practical assistance any day . There was a time when Camille used to pop out of her room at five-thirty , eager to mince onions and stir sauce . Then again , there was a time that a wall divided the east and west of Germany . Life was not a static experience . We should n't expect things to remain the same . I held four chicken breasts in my cupped hands . I stared into the cold , translucent flesh , wondering how I could make them sing . I got tired of cooking dinner . Everybody gets tired of cooking dinner . There 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is this good for you ? Is it balanced , is it green , will he like it , will she eat it , do I have the right ingredients , enough time , will this new recipe fail me ? Camille would n't eat red meat anymore and had recently informed me as I set a plate of chops on the table that pork , so widely advertised as " the other white meat , " was in fact as red as a flank steak . " Pigs are more intelligent than dogs , " she said . " Why do n't we just eat Benjy for dinner ? " Lately she had been talking about giving up chicken and fish , maybe even becoming a vegan , which would reduce me to coming up with fascinating ways to cook broccoli every night without benefit of cheese sauce . My mother clipped chilled-salad recipes from women 's magazines and taped them onto the refrigerator to voice her own preferences . Sam was deeply suspect of anything that he had n't eaten before and had been known to pick dishes apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyatt , my vacuum , the only truly brilliant eater in the family , was a junior in college and enjoying the deep , hot wells of cafeteria food that could be ladled onto a tray . As for me , I could n't have cared less . I think I would have been happy with a carton of lemon yogurt every night if it meant I did n't have to cook . Dinner , I think , would be fascinating if I only had to do it once a week . Dinner could be riveting if there was a way to make it cake . I washed the chicken breasts and stripped out their tendons with pliers . As I was beating them flat between sheets of wax paper I started thinking about making a carrot cake . I had plenty of carrots . I had been planning on making glazed carrots for dinner but there was no reason why I could n't shred them instead . My family tended to grumble when there was too much cake in the house . As a rule , they liked to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales , to sick friends , for someone 's birthday . When Camille 's friends came over they told her she was lucky . " My mom would n't know how to bake a cake if you threw a box of Duncan Hines at her , " her friend Becca said as she lobbed off a hunk of chocolate chiffon , but Camille only snarled . Still , if I made the carrot cake without frosting , if I put a minimal amount of sugar in it and baked it on a sheet pan so that I could slice it into squares , I could practically pass it off as cornbread . It had n't been a great day , and no one ever objected to cornbread . I left the chicken for a minute and got out the flour . There were raisins and walnuts . I held two cold eggs in one hand and felt the knot between my shoulders start to unravel the tiniest bit around the edges . *** An hour later Oprah had said her piece and my mother came into the kitchen and sniffed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed the oven light on and peered inside . " Carrot bread . " I pulled the pot holders out of their drawer . " There is no such thing . Really , I 'm going to be the size of a house if you keep baking this much . " " I 've always baked this much and you 've never been heavy a day in your life . " " That is n't true , " my mother said , pouring herself a vodka and orange juice . " I looked like a snowman when I was pregnant with you . " " That was a long time ago . Nobody remembers it . " " I remember it , " she said darkly . I picked up the phone in the kitchen and called Camille 's room . She had her own line with call waiting . No matter how remote Camille could be in person , she always answered the phone , which is why I strictly forbid her to have caller ID . " Dinner , " I said . " Is Daddy home ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck waiting in the kitchen . That was my other rule after no caller ID : We all ate dinner together . I was about to answer truthfully when I heard the back door open . " Yes , " I said , and she hung up . The rain had not abated . Sam came in with sleek tributaries pouring off his suit jacket . He looked nearly drowned . He leaned toward me and I thought he was going to whisper something in my ear , but instead he pulled me to him and held me tightly in the great , wet walls of his arms . I had n't been dry so long myself but I felt oddly dazzled by the spontaneity of his gesture . The water off his coat soaked through my blouse , and once he had kissed me and pulled away , I looked like someone had dumped a bucket of water on my chest . " I 'm sorry , " Sam said . " I 've ruined you . " " I dry very quickly . " " Hollis ! " Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be a pal and fix me one of those . " It was my father who had started the tradition of calling my mother Hollis , her last name , rather than Marie , her first name . She said it was the only thing from their relationship that had stuck , other than me . " It is n't orange juice , " she said with some embarrassment . " I did n't think it was orange juice . Did you think I thought you were drinking orange juice every night ? " " I did , " my mother said . She looked a little confused and I wanted to tell Sam not to tease her . He shook his head . " I know what you 're drinking and I want to join you . " " On a Tuesday ? " she said . " This Tuesday . " My soaking-wet , handsome husband seemed to be a bundle of life this evening . " Ruth , are you having a drink ? " " I was n't planning on it . " " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't plan on . " Sam 's blue eyes looked all the brighter for the rainwater still clinging to his lashes . " Are you all right ? " " Never better , " he said , but his voice did n't convince me . " Hollis , we want two of whatever you 're having . " So my mother returned to the cabinet where the vodka was kept and assumed the role of bartender . She went back to the dishwasher to retrieve the shot glass . My mother believed that mixing a drink without a shot glass was tantamount to putting the bottle to your lips and tipping your head back . Camille shuffled into the kitchen and for a second I thought I saw Sam 's great good mood crumple a little at the edges . He seemed so moved to see her there that if it were n't for all the rain he was wearing , I would have thought he was tearing up . I held out a dish towel but he ignored it . He went to Camille and folded her in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrenched away from him with some effort . " Are you insane ? Look what you 've done to me . " Camille was wearing a T-shirt and some sweatpants and as far as I could see he had n't done any real harm . " Your father is in a hugging mood . " " He has n't hugged me , " my mother said to herself as her steady hand took the vodka right to the rim of the jigger . Sam made an easy turn in his puddle of water but my mother took a giant step away . " I 'm soaked . " Camille put a hand on either side of her head . It was as if she had been sent to live in a house of friendly chimpanzees and she was constantly astonished by the indignity of it all . Then she turned around and was gone again . " Well , now you 've done it , " my mother said , handing Sam his drink . " You frightened her off . You know it 's going to take at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bedroom now . We could starve before she changes clothes . " " What are we doing here , " Sam said , " taming the little fox ? " " I only try to hug her when she has a fever , " I said . I was joking , of course . I was sort of joking . Sam looked at the door through which our daughter had disappeared . " I think we should be more affectionate . That 's one of the things we need to work on . " " Work on it yourselves , " my mother said . She gave me my drink . She 'd thrown in a splash of cranberry juice to make it pretty . I have to say it was n't bad . Sam hung up his coat on the back porch , where it could drip without consequence , and I put the chicken on the table . Camille came back in record time wearing a blue cotton sweater and a pair of low-slung jeans . She pointed at her father . " Do n't . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does n't this look good ? " my mother said to the plate of chicken , which is what she said every night regardless of the meal . " Chickens are shot full of antibiotics , " Camille said . " And it 's not just that . Girls are starting their periods at , like , seven now because the chickens have so many hormones in them . " " Everything is a health hazard if you want to look at it that way . " Sam speared a piece of meat and put it on Camille 's plate , where she looked at it as if it were a squirrel hit in a mad dash across the road . " Walking across the street is dangerous . Driving a car , very dangerous . Think about what 's in the water , or in the air for that matter . For all we know we 're sitting on top of the biggest source of radon in Minnesota . Did you ever think about that ? " " You 're so morbid , " Camille said morbidly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just sticking up for the chicken . My point is , you never really know what 's good for you or what 's bad for you . Have you done the right thing or the wrong thing ? You never know what 's going to get you until it 's too late . " I put down my fork . My mother and daughter put down their forks as well . We all stared at Sam . " What in the world happened to you today ? " Sam sliced , chewed , reflected . " Nothing much . " " May I be excused ? " Camille said to no one in particular . " You have n't eaten , " my mother said . " I ate something , " Camille said , though she must have meant she ate something for lunch because clearly she had n't eaten her dinner . " Stay put , " Sam said . " At least have a piece of cake , " I said . " Cake ! " Camille cried . " You know I ca n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a bakery . " " This is n't a bakery , " Sam repeated quietly , as if it was news to him . " She ca n't have cake if she has n't eaten her dinner , " my mother said . But I was already on my feet , already heading over to the pan on the kitchen counter . The debate was still raging but I had a knife in my hand . It was carrot cake , after all , which is practically a serving of vegetables . " I 'm going to be the size of a house , " Camille said . " You are currently the size of a coat hanger . A house is a long way away . " Sam reached forward and pulled her plate toward the middle of the table and I smoothly set the cake down in its place . Usually he would complain about the cake too , but tonight he backed me up . Camille was grumbling , but up came the fork and she took a delicate bite . " Cake when she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It was wrong . It was the moral equivalent to pouring vodka without a shot glass . Camille 's eyes fluttered and then closed . The cake was warm and her fork went down again . " Oh , " she said quietly . There was a time I cared : a meat , a vegetable , a starch , some cake . Life had an order , but now the point only seemed to be eating . Here was my daughter , eating , devouring , she was almost through with the cake . " Did you make this with honey ? " Camille said . There was something in her voice I nearly recognized . It sounded like interest , kindness . " I did . " " Because sometimes " She could n't finish her sentence without stopping for another bite . " You use brown sugar ? " " It 's another recipe . " " I like the honey . " " The problems they 're having with bees these days , " Sam began , but I held up my hand and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment to hear about the plight of the bees . My mother took a long , last sip of her drink and then went to the counter to get the cake , the knife , and three more plates . " First the two of you are having a drink on a Tuesday , now we 're all eating cake before we finish our dinner . " She cut four pieces and gave the first one to Camille , whose plate was empty . " It 's madness . Anarchy . It must make you wonder what 's coming next , " Sam said . My mother handed me my plate . I do n't eat that much cake , but I never turn down a slice . The four of us ate , pretending it was a salad course . Camille was right to pick up on the honey . It was the undertone , the melody of the cake . It was not cloying or overly sweet but it lingered on the tongue after the bite had been swallowed . I did n't miss the frosting at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat cream cheese longer than most people would have thought possible . I could beat it until it could pass for meringue . When we were finished with our cake we were all as happy as babies .
