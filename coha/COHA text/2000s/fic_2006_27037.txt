Beg Me Ash says she 's the Dark Queen of the Damned . I say I 'm the Empress of the Undead . My dad , passing by the bathroom where we 're getting ready , takes one look and declares us Two Weird Girls from Jersey . " That 'll work , " Ash says . Tonight , we 're Goth . We 've got the layers of black mesh shirts , the cargo pants rolled up to the knees , the ripped fishnets , the combat boots , the white face makeup and the smudgy rings of eyeliner . Ash brought a can of black hair spray , but she 's already used most of it on her curly brown hair . " Not sure if there 's enough left for you , Rapunzel . " " Shut up and start spraying , " I say . My hair is blond , and long enough to tuck into the back of my cargoes . Ash blackens the strands around my face and puts skunky streaks all around the back . The noise scares Cat Stevens -- aka Stevie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from his perch on the toilet tank . He jumps down and dashes out of the bathroom . " What did you do to Stevie ? " my mom calls . I hear her murmuring , " Poor baby kitty . Little marmalade man . " After Ash finishes , we crowd the mirror . " We are so hot , " she says . And we are . Dark and freaky and brooding , the way vampires might look . I should like it more than I do . My black bra does n't fit right , and the straps dig into my shoulders . The fishnets itch . It 's a stupidly warmnight , and I 'm already sweating . Plus , I 've got on so much mascara that when I blink , my lashes spike my skin . It 's different for Ash . She 's sort of Goth-y anyway , with her pierced eyebrow and sharp cheekbones and the German swearwords courtesy of her Deutsch grandma . I lean closer to the mirror . " I should have bought contacts . In the store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like a lizard . " Ash frowns . " You have the coolest eyes on the planet . Amber . " " Right , " I say . " Like that stuff insects get caught in . " " Plus , " she says , ignoring me , " you do n't get contacts for one Halloween party . " Ash blinks her own dark eyes , lush as melted chocolate . " And you can stop being so cranky , please . " " Sorry . " I bite my lip . " Can you believe this is our last Halloween together ? " Ash 's hands fly up . " Enough with the ' Can you believe this is our last whatever ? ' stuff . It 's October . We 've got like eight whole months of school left . " " More like seven . " " Seven , then . " " Six if you count vacations , " I say . " Audrey , the key word is ' months . ' Besides , " she says , digging her elbow into my side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . " " Like what ? " " Like a certain person by the name of Luke DeSalvio , who I 'm sure will be at Joelle 's tonight . You remember him . " " Oh , " I say . " Right . " " Listen to her ! " says Ash . " Oh , right . Like you are n't about to explode all over this bathroom . " " Yeah , well . Like you 're always reminding me , it 's not serious . We 're just friends , " I say . " With benefits , " says Ash , her voice low so my parents ca n't hear it . " Anyone for tongue sushi ? " I smile but do n't answer . This is Ash , the girl whose name is always mentioned in the same breath as mine : AshandAudrey , AudreyandAsh . But there 's so much I have n't told her , and now I do n't even know where to start . What I do know : me and Luke are n't friends , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell him this tonight , if the subject ever came up . But we never did do much talking . " There will be lots of guys at the party , " I say . " Who knows ? Maybe I 'll branch out a little . " " Really ? " Ash says . " Well , well . I guess someone 's got a brain in her head after all . " Her phone bleats like a sheep and she grabs for it , looks at the screen . " Picture mail , " she says . She presses a few buttons and the image pops up . " My baby brother in his Spider-Man costume . " I look over her shoulder . " Cute . " " Please . The boy 's a demon from hell . Last week , he actually peed in one of the houseplants . " Ash tosses the phone back on the sink and shakes her head in the mirror . " The spray looks great on you , but it makes my hair look like ramen noodles . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say . " You have to get your parents to take you to normal restaurants once in a while . Pizza , anyone ? " " We go out for pizza . Of course , it 's the kind with a cornmeal crust and gobs of goat cheese . " " Goats ! " says Ash . My not-quite-normal parents are waiting for us in the living room with two glasses of wine and a digital camera -- the wine for them , the camera for us . Usually , I hate all the pictures . I do n't need anyone documenting my awkward teenage years . Tonight my dad insists and for once I 'm okay with it , maybe because I do n't look much like me anymore . My dad has us pose on the antique church pew against the yellow wall . He backs up and almost falls over the coffee table . My mom laughs and takes a sip of wine , shining and velvet in the light . They love this part , the part when I 'm getting ready to go out but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be hard for them when I 'm off at college . Besides Cat Stevens , I 'm all they 've got . " Okay , girls , " my dad says . " Look Gothic ! " " Goth , Dad , " I say . " Not Gothic . " " Sorry , " he says . " Ready ? Say ' Goat cheese ! ' " Because it 's my dad , we both yell " Goat cheese ! " In the picture , we 've got the black hair , the white skin , and the bruise-colored lips , but we 're both grinning like five-year-olds . Ash takes one look at the picture and says , " We 've got to work on our attitudes , girl . We 've got to think dark thoughts . " Continues ...
