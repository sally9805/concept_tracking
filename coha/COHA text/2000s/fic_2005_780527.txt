# THE JACKET # <p> Current Draft by Massy Tadjedin <p> Based on a Previous Screenplay by Marc Rocco <p> April 15 , 2003 <p> Section 8 4000 Warner Blvd 818-954-4840 <p> A pure white screen . Idyllic stillness . All of it looking and feeling like the heavens are supposed to . <p> After some seconds of calm , water seems to mist the screen and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest this is a man 's P.O.V. Then , suddenly , the white screen is tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead man . <p> # WILLIAM STARKS ( V.O. ) # I was 25 years old the first time I died ... <p> INT . HOSPITAL , KUWAIT , DAY <p> One more tug on the sheet and we see , and suddenly hear , from William Starks ' P.O.V. the CHAOS of the hospital around him as DOCTORS and NURSES tend as best as they can to the injured soldiers . <p> Our glimpse of STARKS reveals a red stretcher  --  soaked in blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skull . <p> Then , slowly , steadily , a heartbeat is heard over the muffled sounds of the hospital and , as his pulse quickens , so does the pace of the world around him . <p> INT . HOSPITAL , KUWAIT , DAY <p> # WILLIAM STARKS ( V.O. ) # I remember there was so much white everywhere . And I felt peace ... even though there was war around me . And I felt alive , even though I knew I was dead . <p> INTERN #1 Come on , come on , let 's tag these guys and get them out of here . <p> An INTERN , clipboard in hand , stands above STARKS ' unmoving body with another INTERN ( 2 ) beside him . INTERN 1 pulls the rest of the SHEET off of STARKS as the OTHER searches for his DOG TAGS and gently closes his EYES with her hand . <p> INTERN #2 Reading from the TAGS Starks , William . Born December 25 , <p> INTERN #1 Wait , so how old ? <p> INTERN #2 <p> INTERN #1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born in Vermont . He has n't got a family listed . The naval hospital 'll figure out what to do with him . <p> As the INTERN puts the TAGS back down , she meets STARKS ' wide-open EYES  --  now filled with surfacing tears , sadness , and life . She stares at them curiously and , after some seconds , STARKS blinks and a TEAR runs down his cheek  --  jarring her . <p> INTERN #2 Calling out Oh my God ! This soldier is ALIVE ! Code blue ! CODE BLUE ! This man just blinked ! <p> INTERN #1 He 's been tagged already . Worry about the others ... then seeing STARKS blink Oh shit ! Shit ! CODE BLUE ! We need a doctor ! Get a doctor over here now ! <p> As the MEDICAL STAFF rush over to STARKS , preparing NEEDLES and OXYGEN MASKS , STARKS merely closes his eyes and we follow the now BLOODIED white sheet as it falls to the ground ... <p> EXT . IRAQI VILLAGE , DAY <p> A NEWSANCHOR interviews CAPTAIN ROBERT MEDLEY ( 30s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # CAPTAIN MEDLEY # The level of arms on the ground really depends . Answering a question But no , I 'd have to say we have n't had to engage on the ground as heavily as we might have expected . <p> # NEWSANCHOR # Have you lost any men today , Captain ? <p> # CAPTAIN MEDLEY # No . One of my Corporals took a bullet to the head , but it looks like he might make it . Looks that way ... <p> FLASHBACK TO : <p> EXT . IRAQI VILLAGE , DAY <p> We see only the HAND , and not the man to whom it belongs , enter the frame and pull the TRIGGER on a gun . The sound pierces the air , and the bullet hits the side of STARKS ' head in a FLASH , shaving the skin around it right off . <p> EXT . AMERICAN NAVAL HOSPITAL , DAY <p> STARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed  --  his head heavily BANDAGED and his arms suited with I.V . ' s and dressings  --  as a MAJOR , a LIEUTENANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face  --  now cleaned of the blood that masked it before  - -  is alert , and striking . Even with the bandages , he remains well-built and strong , like a shot straight to the head would have been the only way for an enemy to take him down . <p> # DOCTOR # Sergeant Starks was very lucky . A little more to the right and it would n't have wanted to come out ... <p> # MAJOR # But he 's never gon na be able to remember what happened ? <p> # DOCTOR # It 's hard to say . Sergeant Starks could have retrograde amnesia or ... lowering his voice any form of psychological suppression . It 's very common with traumas like this . <p> STARKS Cutting him off Sergeant Starks is in the room , beat and I want to know when I 'm going home . <p> When he speaks , STARKS maintains the sharp , steady gaze of a man assured of himself , even if he is lost among his surroundings . <p> # LIEUTENANT # Sergeant , you have no surviving family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or distant relatives , but unfortunately we have no record of them yet . <p> # MAJOR # Captain Medley has recommended you for the Purple Heart , Sergeant . <p> STARKS lets the tribute roll right off him . He spots the CIGARETTES in the Lieutenant 's pocket . <p> # STARKS # Can I have one of those ? <p> # LIEUTENANT # Of course . <p> The LIEUTENANT lights one for him . <p> # DOCTOR # There is help for you , Sergeant . <p> # LIEUTENANT # Of course there is . <p> Their VOICES start to fade as STARKS smokes his cigarette , blowing the SMOKE upwards and following it with his eyes . He 's finished with these men and everything they stand for . <p> STARKS V.O. I did n't know where my home was . I just knew I did n't want to be there anymore . <p> EXT . HIGHWAY , RURAL VERMONT , WINTER , DAY <p> STARKS  --  recovered now  --  walks by himself along a long highway . He seems to be walking away from things even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXT . HIGHWAY , RURAL VERMONT , WINTER , DAY <p> JEAN PRICE ( 30s )  --  a hippie who happens to be a mother  --  and her daughter , JACKIE ( 8 ) tremble in the cold next to their stalled car . JEAN sits next to the car , holding her knees to her chest , more like a child than her daughter . <p> JACKIE runs her little gloved hand over her mom 's ski-hatted head as she cautiously watches STARKS approach them . He cuts an arresting figure against the empty landscape . <p> # JACKIE # Come on , mom . Do n't fall asleep ... <p> # STARKS # You two ok ? <p> # JACKIE # Our car wo n't start . <p> STARKS Looking at JEAN What 's your mom 's name ? <p> JACKIE Cautiously Jean . <p> STARKS takes off his backpack and kneels down . <p> # STARKS # Jean ? Jean , can you hear me ? I need you to try to wake up , Jean . <p> JEAN opens her eyes , stone red . <p> # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # JACKIE # Yeah , but I do n't know what . <p> # STARKS # Beat What 's your name ? <p> # JACKIE # Jackie . <p> JACKIE decidedly sticks out her gloved hand . STARKS smiles and briefly shakes it . STARKS rubs a hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks of what to do . <p> # STARKS # Nice to meet you , Jackie . Why do n't you wrap this scarf around yourself and try to keep your mom awake while I take a look at your car . <p> EXT . HIGHWAY , RURAL VERMONT , WINTER , DAY <p> As Starks works on their engine , JACKIE anxiously watches her mother throw up in the distance . STARKS sees her watching and tries to distract her . <p> # STARKS # What do you think of all this snow ? <p> JACKIE looks at him curiously . <p> # JACKIE # Beat Nothing . <p> STARKS looks at her and smiles at her honest answer ; Jackie turns her head back towards her mother . <p> # JACKIE # But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , can you reach the gas pedal ? <p> # JACKIE # Yeah . <p> JACKIE gets behind the wheel , crouching down in the seat just enough so her foot reaches the pedal . <p> # STARKS # Go ahead , turn it on . Keep pushing it . <p> JACKIE revs up the engine and , a few coughs and sputters later , the car settles into a nice , working hum . <p> JACKIE Smiling It works ! <p> JACKIE steps down . She looks like she could hug Starks and , unexpectedly , decides to . As STARKS awkwardly returns it , he sees JEAN lifting her eyes to see him holding her daughter . <p> # JEAN # Get your fucking hands off my daughter ! <p> # JACKIE # Mom , he just fixed our car . <p> # JEAN # Jackie , get in the car . NOW ! <p> JEAN reaches for a RIFLE in the back of the truck but stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up . <p> # JEAN # Look , I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I , ma'am . I 'll be on my way . <p> # JACKIE # Mom , you 've got it wrong ... <p> STARKS motions for JACKIE to stop as he collects his bags . <p> # JACKIE # You 're just gon na walk ? <p> # STARKS # Yeah , I 'll hitch a ride or something . Beat Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel . <p> STARKS ' DOG TAGS are tied to the ZIPPER of one of his bags . <p> # JACKIE # What 're those ? <p> # STARKS # Dog tags . Off her blank look They 've got your name and date of birth for identification . <p> # JACKIE # What for ? <p> # STARKS # Beat In case you get lost , or ca n't remember who you are . <p> JACKIE Still looking at them Hm . <p> STARKS unties them and gives them to her . She reads them . <p> # STARKS # I think I can remember what 's on them . <p> # JACKIE # William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INT . COURTROOM , SMALL TOWN VERMONT <p> STARKS faces the screen with nothing but a cryptic BLACKNESS about him and a confused look on his face as a MENACING VOICE questions him . <p> VOICE ( O.S. ) " Jackie " and " Jean " are the only ... things you know for certain about that day ? <p> STARKS nods . <p> VOICE ( O.S. ) Are you aware we have no last name , no place of residence , and no record of any physical presence for these " friends " of yours ? How 's that possible in this day and age ? <p> STARKS nods as a muffled " Objection " flickers away in the background ... <p> VOICE ( O.S. ) I may need to actually hear that answer , Mr. Starks . <p> # STARKS # Beat Yes . <p> With Starks ' answer , the background of the courtroom is suddenly illuminated and we see that THIS IS STARKS ' OWN TRIAL . The VOICE belongs to a satisfied PROSECUTION who turns to face a medium-sized CROWD watching on ... <p> INT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WITNESSES called to the stand : CAPTAIN MEDLEY , Starks ' commanding officer in the Persian Gulf ; DR . HALE , a psychiatrist ; and OFFICER NASH , the cop who first came upon the crime scene . Their three testimonies are intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and confusingly  --  just like it appears to himself . <p> OFFICER NASH Emotional Eddie correcting himself , Officer Harrison , was lying in a pool of his own blood  --  on his back . <p> DR . HALE William Starks could be blocking the incident . It would explain his well-systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother . A delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this . <p> OFFICER NASH Cont 'd Officer Harrison 'd been shot three times . He was long dead by the time we got there . <p> DR . HALE I have heard of Gulf War Syndrome . The medical community is only beginning to gather information about it . <p> # PROSECUTION # Gulf War Syndrome ? What the ... Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I 've gotten a lot of convictions we could overturn with that logic ... <p> # CAPTAIN MEDLEY # Sergeant Starks was awarded the Purple Heart . That award does n't applaud violence or murder . Beat It applauds honor . <p> DR . HALE Cont 'd His subconscious is blocking it , the same way it began to in the Gulf , particularly as something similarly traumatizing happened to him then . <p> The following summations are punctuated by the BLACK FADES between them and the simulated BLACK around them as they speak  --  like STARKS , at the beginning of his own testimony . <p> PROSECUTION Disdainfully It 's not a question of whether or not he was sane when he did it ? ! He absolutely was . Three bullets in one man are three moral failings in another . <p> CAPTAIN MEDLEY Incensed War is n't a CNN Special . Half the shit that went on could n't be tidied into a top of the hour headline  - -  either ' cause it could n't be said neatly or ' cause it could n't be said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put ugly on TV . Looking at Starks If Starks did kill that officer ... Beat You ca n't hold a man responsible for a damaged mind . <p> # DEFENSE # For God 's sake , my client said he thinks he 's already died once . He does n't know what 's going on . <p> FLASHBACK TO : <p> EXT . MURDER SCENE , HIGHWAY , VERMONT , DUSK <p> STARKS lies bleeding  --  eyes half open  --  by OFFICER HARRISON 'S dead , bloodied body as falling SNOW slowly whitens them both and covers any FOOTPRINTS that may have been left behind . We hear a distant gavel delivering a distant judgment ... <p> STARKS V.O. , nearly whispered I do n't know how it happened . <p> STARKS ' eyes finally close as he lapses into unconsciousness . <p> INT . COURTROOM , SMALL TOWN VERMONT <p> The JUDGE nods as he hands the JURY FOREMAN back the verdict . <p> # JURY FOREMAN # On the count of first degree murder , we find the defendant , William Starks , not guilty by reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WINTER , DAY <p> In his mind , STARKS is walking out of the woods as the sun sets and bounces off the snow all around him . We see JACKIE watching him walk away into the woods . <p> JUDGE ( O.S. ) I hereby sentence you to be committed to a facility for the criminally insane , where I hope that doctors and the proper treatment can help you ... <p> INT . COURTROOM , SMALL TOWN VERMONT <p> The JUDGE sentences STARKS , who stares back vacantly , like a man who checked out of his life long before this judge decided he had to . <p> EXT . ALPINE GROVE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL , DAY <p> A white VAN pulls up to Alpine Grove Psychiatric Hospital  --  a bleak , dated facility embellished only by the barbed wire that seems to be everywhere around it . <p> STARKS ' anatomy instantly and intensely separates him from the staff of the hospital and the infirm patients who might be in it . TWO MEMBERS of that STAFF lead him in . <p> JUDGE O.S. Mr. Starks , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost only one life in this tragedy . <p> INT . CONFERENCE ROOM , ALPINE GROVE MENTAL HOSPITAL <p> DR . THOMAS BECKER ( overworked , dogmatic , disenchanted ) , DR . BETH LORENSON ( 30s , unassuming , perceptive ) , and DR . GRIES ( 20s , green ) are convened with other STAFF at a routine hospital meeting . These doctors deal in the currency of madness every day and wear the heaviness of that burden on their faces . <p> CHIEF OF STAFF I 'd certainly say he should be considered violent , just given his case ... <p> DR . BECKER How 'd he dodge a conviction ? <p> CHIEF OF STAFF His defense argued post-traumatic stress and delusional disorder . He evidently could n't account for a similar incident during his service in Desert Storm . <p> DR . BECKER Beat So why is n't he just in the psych ward of the county jail ? <p> CHIEF OF STAFF Apparently , he 's a decorated vet . And had another one testify for him . Who knows ? To DR . BECKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugs a nod as the Chief moves on to the next order of business ... <p> INT . STARKS ' ROOM , WARD , ALPINE GROVE , DAY <p> STARKS is shown to his room by NURSE HARDING  --  stern , senior  - -  and her henchman , DAMON  --  a BURLY ORDERLY who relishes his command , however diluted it may be . <p> DAMON unceremoniously puts Starks ' UNIFORM on the bed . He and NURSE HARDING wait at the door for Starks to change into it . <p> DAMON looks at STARKS  --  his eyes inadvertently conceding that Starks is more threatening than the common senile he marshals ; STARKS stares him back  --  deliberately conceding that he 's right . <p> STARKS turns around  --  only then looking stunned in the sterile , cotton-white room , wondering where his life disappeared to . <p> INT . DR . BECKER 'S OFFICE , ALPINE GROVE , DAY <p> STARKS sits opposite DR . BECKER in a harsh , tiled office . STARKS wears his blue uniform and BECKER wears a doubtful expression . From STARKS ' P.O.V. : the DRUGS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becker . <p> # BECKER # William ? William , can you hear me ? <p> STARKS nods groggily . <p> # BECKER # I 've given you some drugs to help with your adjustment ... <p> STARKS Cutting him off What kind of drugs ? Beat ' Cause these seem pretty ... pretty serious . <p> # BECKER # Well , your condition 's pretty serious . <p> # STARKS # Beat So they say . Off Becker 's steady gaze What ? <p> # BECKER # I 'm just looking at you . Does that make you uncomfortable ? <p> # STARKS # Depends on what you 're seeing . <p> BECKER eyes STARKS mistrustfully . <p> # BECKER # You said you could n't remember killing Officer Harrison . Correct ? <p> # STARKS # Beat You do n't believe me , do you ? <p> # BECKER # It 's not my job to believe you . <p> STARKS Squinting to better see You 're a doctor . I would think ... <p> BECKER Cutting him off firmly It 's not my job to believe you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cure you and if that 's a no-go , then to ... take some kind of care of you . <p> STARKS Flatly Lucky me . <p> BECKER looks at Starks  --  his eyes casting shame upon the alleged murderer that sits before him . <p> BECKER Stupefied You shot a man three times : first in his heart , then in his stomach and then ... point blank , in the back of his head . And then you just ... forgot all about it . A whole life erased with three easy little words : I. Do n't . Know . What would it be if we could all not know what we did n't want to have to face . <p> BECKER glances at his WATCH and gets up  --  still blurred in Starks ' P.O.V. It 's only as he 's walking off that Starks notices he has a limp . <p> FADE TO : <p> INT . HALLWAY , ALPINE GROVE , DAY <p> From STARKS ' P.O.V. , we follow him walk down the hospital halls , even hazier from the medication than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of him is a crazy world with crazy patients who 've lost their way in it . <p> STARKS reaches for the WALL and runs his HAND over it , trying to keep his balance . He 's walking towards BECKER who stands at the end of the hall , talking to other PATIENTS . <p> STARKS Softly I do n't belong here . I do n't ... <p> STARKS falters but stays up . He turns to see a shell of an OLD MAN looking right through him with wooden eyes . STARKS ' eyes stay so completely fixed on the old man 's haunting sight that he does n't see what 's ahead of him . <p> He bumps right into a HYSTERICAL PATIENT whose sudden , earsplitting SCREAMS peal interminably through the air . <p> STARKS Mumbling I 'm sorry . I did n't mean ... I 'm sorry . I did n't mean it . <p> STARKS ' fumbled efforts to help the PATIENT only feed his hysteria more . The SCREAMING is intolerable . <p> STARKS Forced to yell Will you listen to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't mean to bump ... I 'm sorry . <p> ORDERLIES and NURSES , followed by DR . BECKER , surround them now , violently pulling STARKS off the patient . BECKER , familiar with the PATIENT ( HAROLD ) , tries to calm him . <p> # BECKER # It 's ok , Harold . It 's ok . <p> STARKS searches their blurred faces and stops on Becker 's as they restrain him and give him more drugs . <p> STARKS To Becker I do n't belong here ... <p> BECKER Angrily , to the ORDERLIES Get him to his room . <p> FADE TO BLACK . <p> INT . STARKS ' ROOM , ALPINE GROVE , LATE NIGHT <p> STARKS is slowly rebounding from the drugs when he hears disquieting FOOTSTEPS in the hall , coming closer and closer ... <p> What follows happens too quickly for STARKS to react . <p> DR . GRIES , NURSE HARDING AND DAMON  --  enter Starks ' room . They close the door and deftly administer a TRANQUILIZER and a GAG . <p> STARKS has no idea what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his STIFLED CRIES ensure no one else does either . <p> # NURSE HARDING # Come on , army boy . Time for some therapy . <p> INT . MORGUE , BASEMENT , ALPINE GROVE , LATE NIGHT <p> The first face STARKS sees as the world comes into focus is NURSE HARDING 'S . Around it loom those of DR . BECKER , DR . GRIES and DAMON . <p> A shot of the room shows a constraint-ridden apparatus hanging sternly on the wall . It is THE JACKET : an apparatus designed to encase a man 's body . Made of coarse , sickly-stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would first chafe , then forever burn , the skin they 're wrapped around , the JACKET looks medieval . Its appearance suggests its purpose : to slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN . <p> STARKS has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement . Even under the tranquilizers , STARKS formidably resists them as the ORDERLIES wrestle to strap him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something bad is being done to him , wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them . <p> # STARKS # Wait . Wait a minute ... Please . <p> BECKER motions for them to stop with his hand . STARKS blinks , trying to bring the faces above him into focus ... <p> # STARKS # I , I do n't belong here . <p> BECKER looks into Starks ' eyes . Sanity stares back . <p> # BECKER # No . I do n't think you do either . Beat But neither of us can do anything about that . <p> BECKER barely nods and STARKS is trussed in the JACKET with METAL CLAMPS . BECKER writes some details down , presumably about Starks ' treatment . <p> A CADAVER DRAWER  --  just barely deep enough for a body or tall enough for the height of a nose  --  is slid open and STARKS , already dreadfully sheathed in the JACKET , is crammed inside . <p> The ORDERLIES slam the cadaver drawer into the wall . <p> INT . CADAVER DRAWER <p> STARKS is literally entombed alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the CLANG echoes through his body . The BLACKNESS and CLOSENESS of the space choke him as his heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle . <p> We see only the WHITES of a pair of petrified EYES on a man who 's losing it  --  hyperventilating , suffocating ... for all intents and purposes , dying the worst kind of a death . <p> Combing the walls for any sign of an explanation of what 's happening to him , STARKS sees a single white DOT  --  almost like a fleck of dust  --  flitting between undecided SHAPES in the blackness until , slowly , it grows bigger and bigger ... <p> INT . JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE <p> It 's now a PATTERN of WHITE DOTS that changes the more STARKS stares at it . Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with formless shapes and figures that STARKS tries to discern before they change into something else . Only after STARKS blinks does he start to see the WHITE of the DOTS is SNOW from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 1 ) A little river of RED marring the snow around it , spilling from ... <p> 2 ) OFFICER HARRISON 'S mouth just seconds before his last breath . His eyes close and STARKS sees and hears a FLASH ... <p> 3 ) From the barrel of a GUN fired near him . <p> BLOOD sprays STARKS ' hands as he looks down at them and realizes he 's in the scene and not just watching it . He looks up from his hands and sees in similar flashes ... <p> 1 ) The snow beneath the BLOOD changing to DIRT as STARKS stares at it . This time , the little river of RED comes from ... <p> 2 ) The BODIES of IRAQI villagers , all still except one ... <p> 3 ) That of a IRAQI WOMAN . She unflinchingly lays her hand in the entrails of a CORPSE and smears its blood on her face just before she lies back down among the dead , content to be one of them . <p> The only SOUNDS during these dreadful images have been a trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumping so fast it could be a drum ... <p> The screen goes BLACK and QUIVERS as STARKS clenches his eyes shut . <p> INT . CADAVER DRAWER <p> Just then , as the MUSCLE beneath his eyes starts to VIBRATE , something terrible and wet falls from the ceiling of the drawer . PING ! Right on his eye . The drop of WATER is enough to send this man right over the edge . <p> STARKS ' EYES roll back into his head and start to flutter , shaking the SCREEN right along them until ... <p> INT . MORGUE , BASEMENT , ALPINE GROVE <p> STARKS stands outside his body , looking at the wall of drawers he is in . He bends down to look more closely at a STAIN on the floor  --  DRIED BLOOD  --  and as he runs his HAND over it and stands back up , he is back in the ... <p> INT . JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE <p> IMAGES RACE PAST HIM too fast for him to catch anything but fleeting clips of them . The IMAGES are his MEMORY and , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't ... <p> FADE TO BLACK . <p> INT . DINER , SMALL TOWN VERMONT <p> STARKS sees JACKIE , 8 , sitting by a window in the diner . She turns her head towards the ENTRANCE and , as she looks there , so does Starks . That is when he first lays eyes on a woman , a WAITRESS  --  worn but still lovely  --  leaving the diner . He is taken with her and , for the first time since he 's been in the Jacket , seems calm . Just then , however , the reverie is shattered ... <p> SMASH CUT TO : <p> INT . MORGUE , BASEMENT , ALPINE GROVE , LATE NIGHT <p> The drawer is yanked open to reveal STARKS ' still , drenched face . BECKER , GRIES and the ORDERLIES stand above him . <p> # BECKER # Take him out of it . <p> The ORDERLIES unstrap the JACKET from his body . Blood from his chafed skin drips onto the burial slab . STARKS ' eyes remain closed . <p> # BECKER # William . William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice as it sounds to STARKS ... MUTED . STARKS ' EYES open only enough for him to see the PEOPLE 'S FACES morph chillingly into one another 's . <p> DR . GRIES Less muffled Pulse is 16 , temp , just a hair under 90 . ' Bout right for three hours of psychosis . <p> # NURSE HARDING # That 's not enough , is it ? <p> BECKER looks at STARKS ' battered body . <p> BECKER Wearily , indifferently It 's enough for now . Take him to the infirmary and let him recover there . <p> INT . WARD , ALPINE GROVE , NEXT MORNING <p> STARKS sits , totally disoriented , in the ward with the other , more vocally INSANE patients . He runs his hand uncertainly over the SCARS on his arm from the Jacket and looks around  - -  not knowing where his PARANOIA ends and REALITY begins . <p> The OLD MAN from the previous day is moving slowly with the aid of his walker . He is far less threatening to STARKS today ... just a senile man about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him Let 's get you a destination other than this wall . <p> RUDY MACKENZIE  --  40s , smart eyes , fidgety , with an innocent face  --  watches STARKS help turn the OLD MAN around . <p> # MACKENZIE # That 's Kingsley . Old bastard hears us , I 'm sure . He just does n't want to bother answering so he makes us think he ca n't talk . I know . I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue . Literally . Beat You 're the cop killer , right ? <p> # STARKS # Yeah , guess so . How 'd you know ? <p> # MACKENZIE # TV . Helps numb makes a " crazy gesture " any active mind . Sticking out a jittery hand Rudy MacKenzie . ( MORE ) <p> MACKENZIE ( cont 'd ) Welcome to the village , William Starks . <p> STARKS does n't offer his hand , just looks back at MacKenzie . <p> STARKS Looking away I 'm not really in the mood to talk . <p> # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in disposable language either  --  you know , the small talk , the little talk . Chit . Chat . Useless . The game 's something else though . Think about it : What can we trade with each other in the air between us ? This ... running his hand through the air is our court . Beat , so eager it 's sad I 'm ready to throw the ball . Come on . <p> STARKS looks at MACKENZIE and sees that the constant flow of words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation in his eyes . A dead arm hangs limply by his side , like a weight . <p> STARKS Relenting What are you in here for ? <p> # MACKENZIE # I tried to kill my wife . <p> # STARKS # Do n't you go to jail for that ? <p> # MACKENZIE # I tried something like 30 times . <p> There is , as STARKS rightly figures , no suitable response to that . <p> # MACKENZIE # She 's bigger than me , and she 's stronger than me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always in the heat of the moment . I did n't beat her or anything . Hell , she beat me . But when we 'd start fighting , I 'd go for the knife . Then she kept threatening to have me put away , and looking around she finally did . <p> As he talks , MACKENZIE notes the SCARS on Starks ' arms . Dr. LORENSON observes STARKS and MACKENZIE talking and starts walking towards them . <p> # STARKS # Yeah , well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy . <p> # MACKENZIE # Or just plain stupid . You 'd think by the twentieth time , I 'd have found an alternative method . Maybe a more effective one , if you know what I mean . <p> DR . LORENSON Morning , gentlemen . How are you doing today ? <p> MACKENZIE winks discreetly at STARKS before he replies . <p> # MACKENZIE # It 's a hard one for me , Dr. Lorenson . Finally turns to face her , grimly The world around me , it 's shrinking . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Beat Da-da-bum ! Da-da-bum ! I feel like the horseman of doom is coming for me , Doc .

But MacKenzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away  - -  dead arm in tow . <p> DR . LORENSON So you 're ok ? <p> STARKS Still distracted What ? <p> DR . LORENSON I asked you if you 're ok . <p> STARKS Suspiciously I do n't know . You tell me , Doc . You think there 's anything wrong with me ? <p> DR . LORENSON I do n't know . You 're not my patient . <p> STARKS looks away . Lorenson gives him a once over . <p> DR . LORENSON You look like you 've lost some weight . Are you eating ? <p> # STARKS # I am . One of the few things I remember doing is eating . So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams . <p> STARKS looks at LORENSON , seeing if he 'll respond . LORENSON looks back curiously at STARKS ' pointed stare . <p> # STARKS # You done with your small talk ? <p> DR . LORENSON Sure . <p> # STARKS # Good . <p> STARKS walks away slowly and WEAKLY  --  a fact that does n't escape LORENSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALPINE GROVE HOSPITAL , DAY <p> STARKS walks into the bathroom , keenly eyeing the thin slit of WINDOWS at the top of the wall . He walks closer to them , when he suddenly hears some STRAINED BREATHING from inside one of the stalls . He checks the first stall , pushing it open . It swings both ways since it does n't have a lock . <p> The sound continues . STARKS walks slowly past the second stall to the third and then ... WHACK ! The door swings all the way towards STARKS . BRUTALLY . He falls backwards  --  his head just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink . <p> DAMON , the ORDERLY , walks out . <p> # DAMON # I 'm sorry , Starks . Must have not seen you coming there . <p> STARKS writhes in PAIN  --  straining for his own breath now . <p> DAMON Leaning down close to him Were you worried about me ? Smiling That 's so sweet .

MORGUE , BASEMENT , ALPINE GROVE , CHRISTMAS EVE <p> They 're all in the room . STARKS seems pretty calm . Only in a C.U . do we see his eyes register the JACKET ... <p> # BECKER # I 'm glad to see you 're cooperating this time , Mr. Starks . <p> STARKS looks at the WIDE , STURDY restraints on it . They would really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with them . They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undress him , when STARKS makes a move to do it himself . They look to DR . BECKER who NODS that it 's all right . <p> DAMON begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he steps on one of Starks ' bare feet . <p> STARKS does n't flinch . He merely turns away from them and bends down to take off his pants . On his way up , he GRABS THE JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and , using it like a weapon , aims to smack it across Damon 's face . DAMON deftly ducks and the JACKET hits BECKER instead . The force of the blow sends Becker down , and as he falls against the wall , DAMON and HARDING leap to restrain Starks . <p> BECKER opens and closes his eyes , trying to get them into focus . His right cheek is cut pretty bad . DR . GRIES helps BECKER to his feet and picks his BROKEN GLASSES up off the floor . BECKER puts them on . <p> DR . GRIES Hold him while I get the tranquilizer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot . <p> DAMON KICKS Starks hard in the back , nearly sending him down . <p> # BECKER # No .

He looks up at STARKS who , even in his pain , looks shocked at the force he just used . <p> # BECKER # Let him go . More firmly I said , let him go ! <p> As soon as they let him go , STARKS lunges for BECKER  - -  pushing him up against the wall . STARKS stops , presumably about to harm Becker but unsure , even to himself , of what he 's capable of doing ... <p> BECKER looks fearlessly into Starks ' eyes . <p> BECKER An inch away from his face What , Starks ?

Dr. Becker , how long do you want us to leave him in for ? <p> BECKER does n't answer . He does n't even turn around . DR . GRIES goes after him . <p> DR .

CADAVER DRAWER <p> STARKS finds himself in the physically wrenching place once more . But nothing happens for some seconds . He breathes anxiously , not knowing what to expect . His heart beats steadily : THUMP ... THUMP , until , finally , with each beat , a SMALL WHITE FLECK becomes two flecks ... then , two dots ... then , two circles ... then , the WHITES of a pair of EYES with a terrific meanness in them . <p> The EYES blink , then disappear like they were never there . <p> The pace of STARKS ' heart quickens , and the inexplicable madness surrounds him once more ... <p> EXT . MURDER SCENE , HIGHWAY , VERMONT , DUSK <p> The SOUNDS of BOMBS RAGE around him but he 's in the middle of the murder scene , watching OFFICER HARRISON lie on the floor . He turns to look over his shoulder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN NIGHT-VISION CAMERA , we see FIRE , FLESH , and RUIN littering the sand . Slowly the terrifying images shift to a naturalistic , real-time documentation of the action  --  the ruin  --  as it 's occurring . <p> As STARKS blinks , TEARS fall and he hears , over it all , a counseling voice ... <p> MACKENZIE ( O.S. ) When they take you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves , dance with them . <p> The TERRIBLE SOUNDS become less terrible as they fade away . <p> MACKENZIE ( O.S. ) They do n't eat you when there 's music playing . <p> The scene morphs slowly and the following IMAGES appear vaguely  --  forming the walls of the TUNNEL around him . <p> 1 ) C.U .

DINER , SMALL TOWN , VERMONT , CHRISTMAS EVE <p> The WAITRESS ( early 20s )  --  tired , with kind eyes , soft skin and a beautiful mouth that has n't smiled in a long time  - -  emerges from the diner . Even with no effort , she is remarkably pretty . <p> From her UNIFORM , we know that her day was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems markedly removed from the world around her . The only fact she wears on her is that she 's tired . <p> She spots STARKS and ca n't help but do a double-take . Both are momentarily taken with each other , though she tries to hide any indication that she is . <p> INT . WAITRESS ' CAR <p> She gets in her old car and starts it .

I do n't need a psycho following me today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> # WAITRESS # Good . <p> She turns and gets back in her car , slamming the door shut . She starts to drive and STARKS stares after her . <p> After a few hundred yards , she SLAMS on the brakes and turns the car round , coming back . Then she jumps out of the car and heads back in the diner , without looking over at STARKS . <p> EXT . DINER , SMALL TOWN VERMONT , SOME SECONDS LATER <p> She comes out  --  this time PURSE in hand  --  and sighs at Starks . <p> # WAITRESS # As if she owes him an explanation I forgot my purse . <p> STARKS nods slowly . The WAITRESS gets in her car and looks again at STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR . He has hardly any winter gear on him  --  no gloves , no hat , no coat  --  just jeans and a flannel . He looks lost among his surroundings , as much because he does n't know where he is as because he does n't look like he belongs there . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case you had n't figured , it 's Christmas Eve .

Beat I do n't really know . <p> # WAITRESS # Of course you do n't know . <p> # STARKS # Why " of course " ? <p> # WAITRESS # Because in my life , it would n't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he 's from and a place where he 's going to . It 'd be too simple . I probably would n't know how to handle a situation like that . <p> # STARKS # Well , you definitely did n't pick normal or simple this time either . <p> She looks over at him  --  momentarily suspicious . He looks back innocuously ; there 's something innately safe about him . <p> # WAITRESS # At least you 're honest . That 's some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flask . She pulls out a CIGARETTE , and STARKS lights it for her with some MATCHES . <p> # WAITRESS # That 's great .

That was one of my good glasses ! <p> As she presumably cleans it up , we stay on STARKS who slowly gains hold of himself .

He walks towards them , tripping slightly on a CORD from the LIGHTS . He stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the wall . <p> As he pulls himself up , he spots what is only inches away from where his hand landed on the wall : HIS OWN DOG TAGS , given to Jackie , only a couple weeks ago , hanging from a single NAIL tacked into the wall . <p> Stunned , he stares at his NAME and BIRTH DATE scored on the metal .

IRAQI VILLAGE , NIGHT , 1991 <p> Again , we 're glimpsing the scene through PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN NIGHT VISION intermittently negotiated with real-time images . <p> Opposite Starks stands a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER  --  seething in anger and pointing his gun at a LITTLE BOY , presumably belonging to the MAN not five feet away . Next to Starks is an angry CAPTAIN MEDLEY , ordering STARKS to follow him . STARKS is watching himself in the scene . <p> # MEDLEY # You walk on . They pick up their guns and fire at you , you stay . They pick up and fire at each other , and you walk on ! <p> # STARKS # He 's got his gun pointed at a kid . <p> # MEDLEY # That is not our problem . <p> # STARKS # Yeah , well , none of this is our fuckin ' problem . <p> STARKS turns and aims his gun at a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER threatening to shoot a child . We hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another IRAQI SOLDIER ( 2 ) aiming his GUN at STARKS . <p> # MEDLEY # We are leaving this site right now . <p> STARKS does n't hear him ; he 's busy perfecting his aim . <p> STARKS To the first Iraqi soldier Hey ! <p> At the force of the word , the SOLDIER lowers his gun and the LITTLE BOY flees . <p> STARKS , who is now in the scene himself , lowers his gun slightly as he approaches the SOLDIER . Neither speaks the other 's language but they 're both saying everything with their eyes . Neither moves his off the other . <p> Just then , though , we see the SECOND IRAQI SOLDIER get a clear aim at STARKS . <p> He takes his SHOT before anyone else does .

WARD 3 , ALPINE GROVE , 1992 , DAY <p> STARKS is in a different ward with PATIENTS who appear more threatening and disturbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out  --  Starks hears one of the PATIENTS humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY . Looking to see who it comes from , STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT  --  a young , fierce-looking guy  --  eyeing a YOUNG NURSE , SALLY , administering medication from a dated CART . <p> STARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO DOCTORS or ORDERLIES around . The YOUNG NURSE , meanwhile , is focused on the medicine  --  oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her . <p> The BRUTE 's not that far away when he starts walking towards the YOUNG NURSE . STARKS starts in their direction , picking up speed  --  maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT PATIENTS  --  as the BRUTE reaches the NURSE . <p> He throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the WALL . She starts screaming as he pushes up against her . STARKS picks up the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it . <p> The BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his balance . It 's clear he 's impaired . But it 's also clear he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As she NODS , her EYES dart above to the HAND about to strike him . Off her look , he ducks and turns around , punching the BRUTE in the stomach  --  HARD  --  but not before the piece of GLASS he held from one of the broken MEDICINE BOTTLES comes perilously close to STARKS ' head . <p> The BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS terrified . Is this when he dies ? <p> The BRUTE  --  incensed more than ever  --  lunges at him a final time . STARKS gets him by the NECK , expertly applying PRESSURE POINTS and , after only a few seconds , subdues him . STARKS himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them . He lets out a suspended BREATH , instinctively touching his FOREHEAD to make sure he 's not cut . He looks back at SALLY . <p> # SALLY # Are you ok ? <p> # STARKS # Yeah , Why are you in this ward alone ? Where is everyone ? <p> SALLY Defensively There 's a state rep visiting so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ... <p> # STARKS # Where are the other orderlies ? <p> # SALLY # In the therapy session downstairs .

I 'll go get some doctors . <p> SALLY looks at STARKS , wondering whether she can trust him . Her eyes shift to the BRUTE on the floor and she remembers that she can . <p> INT . MAIN ROOM , WARD , ALPINE GROVE , DAY , 1992 <p> The STATE REP  --  40s , disgruntled , even drowsy  --  is recognizable among a group that includes the CHIEF OF STAFF ( Dr. Williams ) , BECKER , LORENSON and GRIES . They are presiding over a GROUP THERAPY SESSION when STARKS enters ... <p> STARKS Calling out Sorry I 'm late , Dr. Becker . <p> BECKER is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response . <p> # BECKER # Mr. Starks , this session is for our civil patients . Damon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze . <p> STARKS Derisively No . Please , Dr. Becker . You can strap me in a Jacket or even gag me , but please do n't leave me out of therapy . This is where I feel like I make the most progress . <p> BECKER relents , seeing STARKS has the upper hand  --  an AUDIENCE , deranged but eager no less . <p> # BECKER # Fine , Mr. Starks . You can pull up a chair for yourself . <p> As STARKS walks across the room , it 's obvious to everyone  --  as they turn their heads to watch him  --  that he is a physically ailing man . Using all his strength , he walks up slowly to the group , dragging a CHAIR behind him because he does n't have the strength to lift it . STARKS sits down . <p> # BECKER # Mr. Jensen , please continue . <p> JENSEN  --  a twitchy schizophrenic  --  surveys the group seriously , determining whether it 's safe to say what he 's about to ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached by the Federal Trade Organization . <p> BECKER 's not listening to a word JENSEN says . But STARKS is . <p> BECKER Calm as ever And what have they approached you about , Mr. Jensen ? <p> # JENSEN # They want me to head the Organization for the Organized . <p> The other PATIENTS look at him in wonder as the STATE REP listens limply . <p> # BECKER # The Organization ... for the Organized ? <p> # JENSEN # That 's right . Have you heard of them ? <p> # BECKER # No , Mr. Jensen . I have not . <p> GROUP PATIENT 2 That 's because there is no such Organization , you idiot . <p> # JENSEN # That is categorically not true . Bl-bl-blatantly and manifestly NOT TRUE . I 've been asked to lead them . But , if you 'd heard of them , then they would n't be hush-hush , would they ? <p> BECKER Wearily What do the rest of you think ? <p> The GROUP stares at one another silently . <p> STARKS Loud and emphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BECKER # And how is that ? <p> STARKS looks at JENSEN , who looks back avidly . MACKENZIE eyes Starks nervously , like he senses what he is about to do . <p> # STARKS # When I was in the Gulf , the Organization was recruiting the Organized . <p> BECKER Incensed Is that a fact , Mr. Starks ? Because if it 's not , it does n't help Mr. Jensen . <p> STARKS Looking right at Jensen It is a fact . Bona fide , and classified . <p> LORENSON and MACKENZIE watch STARKS curiously . <p> # JENSEN # I knew it ! I knew it !

Beat I did n't want to have to say this ... <p> Not even the DOCTORS dare disrupt the silence ... <p> # STARKS # But these people pointing to the Doctors know about it .

And Jensen , I 'm proud they picked you . <p> JENSEN looks on nobly . <p> # STARKS # They 're always ordering us to stay calm , but how can we be calm ? <p> STARKS suddenly turns right at Becker , wrapping his message to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut . <p> # STARKS # Looking suddenly directly at Becker All they do is give orders . That 's all they have to do . And no one will ever know . All it comes down to is an order . Beat They 've got hands everywhere . <p> STARKS stands up , ready to SALUTE Mr. Jensen . The OBSERVERS look to BECKER for order . <p> # STARKS # Long live the Organization for the Organized ! <p> # BECKER # Sit down , Mr. Starks ! Sit down , Mr. Starks ! <p> But , at that , Jensen 's completely lost it . His excitement erupts in the form of him JUMPING out of his chair and eagerly and elatedly HITTING HIMSELF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Jensen ! <p> Too late . OTHER PATIENTS are on their feet , HANDS jubilantly up in the air . And , in the midst of the havoc , the speechless order is soundly delivered in Becker 's NOD to Damon . <p> # RANDOM PATIENTS # Dr. Thatcher ! Dr. Becker ! <p> DAMON and HARDING grab STARKS while the other members of the STAFF slowly calm the other patients . LORENSON is too busy to notice them taking Starks out .

He closes his eyes and begins to die ... <p> EXT . CRIME SCENE , HIGHWAY , VERMONT , DUSK , 1992 <p> STARKS and TENNY  --  30s , shifty , a total stranger  --  sit in silence in TENNY 'S CAR . ( We recognize the murder scene . ) RED POLICE LIGHTS FLASH in the rearview mirror though STARKS does n't see them yet . <p> STARKS and TENNY are talking to one another . TENNY 's voice takes a dangerous tone . <p> # TENNY # You ever been to jail ? <p> # STARKS # No . <p> TENNY nods , distracting STARKS long enough to slip a hand down his leg to the GUN he 's hidden there . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worse than anywhere you 've ever been . <p> # STARKS # I doubt it .

I was just asking what for . <p> # OFFICER HARRISON # This is a stolen vehicle you 're driving . Now put your hands in the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the second when OFFICER HARRISON sees where TENNY 'S HAND is . As he reaches for his own GUN , the situation explodes as TWO FLASHES eclipse all else . OFFICER HARRISON goes down , still holding his own GUN and STARKS jumps out of the car to check on him . <p> # STARKS # Jesus Christ , what 'd you do that for ? <p> TENNY looks around , still holding the GUN . Starks swallows , assessing whether to back away or not . TENNY waves his gun as he half points it in Harrison 's direction . Then , GUN still in hand , he smirks nervously and looks at STARKS . <p> # TENNY # Man , if you 're so deaf and dumb , you ai n't even worth a fucking bullet . <p> TENNY raises the gun , then aims it away from STARKS and shoots OFFICER HARRISON once more . From the ground , OFFICER HARRISON fires back and STARKS , now lunging at Tenny , TAKES THE HIT . <p> STARKS falls , clearly unable to get up , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUN in his back pocket as he turns to leave . This SMILE was one of the eerie FLASHES that haunted Starks in the JACKET ... <p> STARKS struggles but ca n't move . That 's when he passes out , looking at OFFICER HARRISON from the ground , as he did in the scene before . <p> INT . JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE <p> STARKS stands in the lighted tunnel , which only gets brighter as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that he 's back in there . Then he sees an IMAGE of a WOMAN 'S FOREHEAD that lulls him to a calm until his heart slows and the LIGHT gradually dims ... <p> FADE TO BLACK . <p> INT . DINER , SMALL TOWN VERMONT , 2004 <p> STARKS enters the diner , calming down even more as he spots JACKIE . She looks up , holding PLATES in her hand .

He was taking a lot of them , too . It said he was trying out behavior modification treatments that were banned back in the 70s  --  " womb treatment " is the name he gave to what he did to you ... <p> STARKS Cutting in Womb ?

Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove 's staff changed and I 'm afraid we did n't have the best record system before then . <p> # STARKS # His body was found on January 1 , 1993 , but do you know if that was long after he had died ? <p> DR .

She looks at STARKS curiously and the two share a very lengthy , intense STARE . <p> DR . LORENSON  --  now in her 50s  --  walks closer to Starks suspiciously . For his part , STARKS does n't look as unfamiliar with Lorenson as he should ; this does n't escape Lorenson . <p> # LORENSON # Hello .

JACKIE stares after him  --  alone in the total silence of the room . She listens for the slightest noise and that 's when she actually hears the sound of the DRAWER being opened for herself . <p> She realizes he 's gone . She RUSHES after him , opens the door in a fit , and then , sees what she feared most : no sign of Starks .

This is a " DOG " . <p> # EUGENE # D  --  d  --  d  --  . <p> But Eugene ca n't hold the sound of the letter long enough to make the word .

Is that really what 's going on ? <p> LORENSON spots a corner of Eugene 's EYE twitching slightly , and , rushing to get a better look , takes the shade off of the nearby LAMP and holds it above his head so she can get a better look at him . <p> Just then , TALIA opens the door , startling Lorenson . She knocks over the MILK and , as it spills on the LAMP CORD  --  now on Eugene 's lap  --  it causes an ELECTRIC SHOCK . Eugene catches it . TALIA gasps and Lorenson watches the boy in fear . <p> The moment passes and Eugene  --  more responsive than he has ever been before  --  looks at his mother and Lorenson .

We first see his face , and the devastation on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . <p> JACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table , still only 7 years old .

JEAN and DR . LORENSON look on curiously as STARKS looks in her face , at her hand in his , and then to the heavens for the means to get through this . <p> As STARKS lets go at last , JACKIE looks back at him , sensing the connection even if she does n't know it yet . <p> STARKS turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car .
