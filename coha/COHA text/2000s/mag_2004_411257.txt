. Back when I shot trap seriously , I was always amused at the antics of my fellow competitors . Some guy would break 199x200 , or 499x500 , and look at his gun as though it had stabbed him in the back by missing that one bird . Then he would go thundering off to trade the offending firearm in for a different one . This is the same in all sports . We grow dissatisfied with perfectly good equipment , usually because we blame our own failings on it , and sell it at a loss to buy something supposedly better . I have done so many times , to someone else 's great benefit . The wonderful world of rifles is full of bargains that used to belong to someone else . Mixed in among them , however , is a sprinkling of dogs whose owners ditched them with a song in their hearts . So , just in time for Christmas , here 's how to tell the deals from the lemons. ( 1 ) If the rifle is in poor condition , forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only reason to buy a clunker is for parts . I know gunsmiths who will buy abused Mausers and Winchester Model 70s and throw away everything but the action . They put many hours of work into refurbishing these actions and then build high-priced rifles around them . Nobody else should spend money on a wreck . If you do , you 're asking for trouble . ( 2 ) If you buy a rifle sight unseen , insist on a trial period , during which you can send it back and get a refund . The same applies to firearms bought at gun shows . You need to have a guarantee that you can inspect the rifle thoroughly ( or , if you prefer , have someone you trust inspect it ) and take it to the range to see if it shoots . It is a sad fact that there are some guns that will not group worth a damn , which is why their owners got rid of them . Before you part with your money for good , be sure your acquisition does n't fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sold on consignment , and the prices asked for them are not unchangeable once they 've gathered dust . Very often , a gun owner will have an inflated idea of what his rifle should bring and will insist on getting that price . The dealer who takes it in will try to talk sense to him , but no , his mind is made up . If you want the gun , the best thing to do is wait . As the weeks and months go by , and it sits there unwanted , the owner will eventually see the error of his ways . That is when you leap up , checkbook in hand . ( 4 ) A high price is no guarantee that a rifle will not have problems . A couple of months ago , I saw an acquaintance test-firing a pre-1964 Model 70 Winchester Super Grade .375 . It was in 100 percent condition , meaning that it had never been sold or fired since it left New Haven 40 or more years ago . The asking price was $4,000 , which was $1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem . The problem was that you could not move a cartridge from the magazine to the chamber . That Model 70 was unusable except as a single-shot . I once laid hands on a gorgeous , custom-made little 7x57 that would not chamber factory ammo . My guess is that this jewel of a rifle had a chamber that was cut for the original owner 's strange handloads , and it would n't digest anything else . I did n't buy it . ( 5 ) Beware of dirty rifles . Wear is one thing ; dirt is another . Nicks , dings , and worn bluing are signs of hard use , which is okay . They wo n't affect a rifle 's performance . But dirt  --  particularly a fouled bore  --  is a warning sign . A bore that is fouled with copper is often pitted beneath it , and when you clean the stuff out , you 'll find that you need a new barrel . Whoever owned that rifle did n't care for it worth a damn , and it is waiting to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that someone is not you . ( 6 ) On the other hand , some restoration work can get you a hell of a bargain . Let 's say that you come across a rifle that has a battered stock , or needs to be reblued , but is attractive in all other respects and offered for a very good price . Do n't automatically rule it out . See if the seller will allow you to take the rifle to a gun-smith and get an estimate on what it would cost to restore the gun . You may be surprised at how little it costs . Years ago , I came across a Weatherby .340 with a gorgeous claro walnut stock whose finish had " alligatored " ( fractured into ugly , scaly patches ) . Because of its leprous appearance , the rifle was selling for a song . I bought it and had a gunsmith scrape off the original finish and redo it in oil . It was glorious . Then , for reasons that seemed compelling at the time but baffle me now , I sold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what 's out there . All prices are for rifles in very good to excellent condition , taken from the 24th edition of Blue Book of Gun Values : $100 Remington Nylon 66 autoloader , .22 Long Rifle One of the all-time great .22 sporters , this gun is indestructible and unstoppable. $300 Savage Model 99 lever action , post-World War II production , rotary magazine , wide variety of calibers The Model 99 is a wonderful rifle , and the rotary-magazine versions are truly classy . Accuracy varies greatly from gun to gun , however , so if it 's important to you , shoot the rifle before you spend your money . $400 Marlin Model 455 Bolt Action Sporter , .30/06 Only a few were made in the late 1950s , but they are jewels . $800 Browning FN High-Power Bolt-Action Safari Grade , .30/06 to .338 Truly fine rifles , made from 1959 to 1974 using commercial Mauser actions , very often with lovely claro walnut stocks . Before you buy one , take the barreled action out of the wood to check for rust . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's caused by salt in the wood and you 'll never get rid of it . $900 Weatherby Mark V Deluxe , bolt action , .300 Weatherby Magnum A brand-new Weatherby Mark V lists for $1,900 . But if you get one that 's been gently preowned , the price will be half of that . A great many people buy the .300 , shoot it a couple of times , and decide that it 's too much gun for them , and that is your good fortune . $1,500 Winchester Model 70 Alaskan , bolt action , .338 or .375 H &H; Regarding the much revered but often highly overvalued pre-1964 Model 70 : The quality of these guns ranged from wonderful to appalling , depending on when they were made . You can end up with either a first-rate rifle or a clunker that will almost certainly have to be repaired . $102,000 Holland &; Holland Royal Deluxe side-by-side rifle For your next trip to Africa , go with the best . It will have been made to someone else 's order , but for a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to learn more about this particular subject , invest in How to Buy &; Sell Used Guns , published by Stoeger Publishing , $11 ; 877-GUNBOOK ; **25;1102;TOOLONG Illustration <p>
