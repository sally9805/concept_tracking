People Just Talk : Speech Versus Writing // Have You Seen Any Swamp People ? // Some years ago , an undergraduate student in a course I was teaching gave me a tape she had made of an elderly black woman reciting a folktale . The woman belonged to a group the student had described called " Swamp People , " living on the outskirts of Greenwood , Mississippi , where she had grown up , who dress in unusually colorful clothes , and have a way of speaking unique to themselves . The woman on the tape 's speech sounds like a bizarre casserole of Jamaican patois and Haitian Creole , a dash of Black English , and a sprinkling of something somewhere between Cesaria Evora and God . // Missing links always exert their fascination , and as paleontologists hope to unearth a skeleton of the first dinosaur , some Black English specialists have long hoped that in some remote district of the South , a proto-Black English might turn up . There is a theory that Black English has its roots in the Euro-African hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian patois spoken right here in America , on the Sea Islands off the coast of the Carolinas and Georgia , and in some places a bit inland . But many theorize that black Americans once spoke Gullah more widely , across the South or possibly as far north as Pennsylvania . // Gullah speakers have indeed been found in one little town in Texas-but there is a well-documented after-the-fact historical migration from Georgia that explains it . A pocket of people still speaking a deeply Gullah-fied Black English somewhere , with no evidence that they had roots in today 's Gullah-speaking region , would be a kind of missing link for someone like David Sutcliffe of Pompeu Fabra University in Spain , who has long sought evidence that Black English began as Gullah . David was electrified when I sent him a copy of the tape . For years , he has been mining recordings of ex-slaves made in the 1930s for evidence of Gullah in their speech , but this modern recording of an aged , rural , black woman speaking something that sounded rather Caribbean was something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama was that the student graduated soon thereafter and all attempts to locate her were in vain . All we had was a post-office-box address for the woman that she had included with the cassette . // To make a long story short , a few springs ago David , I , and some other interested parties wound up shuttling around Greenwood , Mississippi , in a van trying to find the Swamp People . Really , the tape has never sounded like Gullah to me . The student certainly had no reason to make the Swamp People up or fake the tape , and I would love to know who this old woman was and what she was speaking . But to get to the bottom of it we would have needed more than a post-office-box address that ended up not corresponding to any actual residence . Yet I came along , because we had all been at a conference nearby and I would n't have wanted to miss just maybe taking part in a really neat discovery . // But it was a long shot-Greenwood is no swamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no filmed record of me and the others bumbling all over it asking ordinary black people buying groceries , sitting in their cars listening to CDs , or tending stores " Have you ever heard of the Swamp People ? " I could only laugh along with them , and our search for the woman or any other Swamp Person was fruitless. // It was a long day . But one interview we did with an elderly black woman yielded an observation that has never left me . Trying to nudge her into giving us some clue that could lead us to people speaking some unusual dialect , we asked her whether she knew of any people in the area who " talked kind of funny . " Our hope that she would say " Oh , yeah-those weird folks out there in the swamps with funny cloths on their heads " was not rewarded . But she did say " Well , seems like most folks , they speak pretty good English , but some people , it seems like they just talk . " She proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English dialect . // But the way she put it captured , as it happened , a basic truth about human speech . On the one hand , there is " speaking , " a kind of effort or nicety that lends itself to ratings such as " pretty good . " On the other hand , there is " talking " - people just letting language fall out of their mouths , with no conscious effort , no striving toward any ideal , just doing what comes naturally . // In the Beginning Was the Mouth // This woman was referring to her immediate context , where African-Americans negotiate a continuum between the standard English of the printed page and the Black English dialect of the familiar realm . In the Mississippi Delta , as in all black communities , Black English is the default , while standard English is something one switches in and out of according to topic , attitude , who one is speaking to , and personal background . But this switch-hitting is a local rendition of how language is used in all literate societies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees . No black Mississippi Delta resident can help dipping daily into is n't versus ai n't or he goes versus he go . The spoken/written boundary is more penetrable in some places than others-the local dialect of Arabic an Arab learns on his mother 's knee is as different from the standard Arabic used in writing and most public language as Latin is from Italian . But worldwide , the use of a language that has both written and spoken varieties entails constant choices between the two toolkits. // But the oral toolkit is ontologically primary . Writing is just a method for engraving on paper what comes out of our mouths . // A modern literate person can barely help but see it the other way around . Taught to write from an early age , when we have n't even fully mastered speech , we naturally tend to process speech as an oral rendition of the " real " language on the page . " The language " is imprinted , nice and tidy , on paper-indelible , authoritative . Talking seems a mere approximation of that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitfully as well-turned as the " real " language sitting on paper as a model . When we utter a word , we can not help but mentally see an image of its written version . In our heads , what we have " said , " or , to get the point across , " sayed , " is that sequence of written symbols . When we say " dog , " a little picture of that word flashes through our minds , Sesame Street-style. // But for all but a sliver of human history , this experience would have been as alien as being " beamed up " to the starship Enterprise would be to us . An estimate for how long human language has existed that few would have their tenure revoked for is 150,000 years . But writing did not exist until about 5,500 years ago in what is now the Middle East . This means that if humans had existed for twenty-four hours , writing would only have come along around 11:08 P.M. For the twenty-three plus hours-or to come back to reality , 144,500 years-before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all humans had the relationship to language that only illiterates have today . Imagine saying " dog " and only thinking of a canine , but not thinking of the written word . If you 're reading this book , it follows that you could n't pull this off even at gunpoint . But for most of human history , no one on earth could even imagine any such failed effort because , from womb to tomb , they just talked . // For us , one way to peel away the layers of the onion and get into a real sense of what language really " is " is through music . Even in a literate population , the proportion of people who do not read music is larger than that which is illiterate , and even those who read music can fairly easily imagine what it would be like to not be able to . Take singing " Happy Birthday . " If you do not read music , then you know that although it corresponds to a sequence of written musical symbols , for you this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your head and larynx on the requisite occasion . You might even do this quite well-fine musicianship does not require musical literacy ( Barbra Streisand does not read music ) . If you do read music , while you know that " Happy Birthday " can be written as a sequence of written notes , you can pretty easily put yourself into the mind of someone who just sings the damned thing-especially since you probably remember not being able to read music as a child . And although the women who wrote " Happy Birthday " were musically literate , theoretically the song could have been produced orally-just as , for example , the little " Ring Around the Rosy " tune that goes with the children 's taunt " Nyah nyah-nyah nyah nyah " most likely was . // Dancing is another example . Dancing can be notated on paper , but such notation plays a relatively marginal role in the dance world . Dancing is , after all , something you just do , is n't it ? If it 's a planned-out affair , like a ballet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just teaches it to the dancers by demonstration bit by bit . And certainly when dancing socially at some party or club , we do not see ourselves as executing a version of an activity whose " real " representation is on the page . Of course , someone could videotape us wiggling around for fifteen minutes and encode it in a language designed to register each step , each swing of the arms , and each toss of the head . And on being presented with the transcription , we would be a tad perplexed , perhaps even a little uncomfortable , and not give it a moment 's thought the next time we went out dancing . Dancing is something we do , not write down . // Language is exactly like singing and dancing . Printing and the spread of literacy happen to have created a First World in which the written version of language infuses our very souls , in a way that musical transcription only does for a few , and dance transcription for even fewer . But properly speaking , that is a historical accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely , genetically specified for is an oral one . Just as we have no genetic endowment for driving , although many of us do it daily , we have no genetic endowment for reading ( which in fact damages our eyes ) or writing ( which is hard on the hands and , on keyboards , now gives millions carpal-tunnel problems ) . // In fact , most of the 6,000 languages in the world remain , for all intents and purposes , exclusively oral in their usage . Of course by now most of them have been transcribed onto paper in some way-brief word lists in some cases , longer word lists and short grammatical descriptions in many others . For hundreds of languages there are these plus , say , Bible translations and some transcriptions of folktales . But even in these cases , the very sight of the language on the printed page is something of a novelty for its speakers , commonly evoking a certain marvel and gratitude . For them , the language remains fundamentally oral , used casually at home or with friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to be read-no newspapers , magazines , or novels . How deeply can a word list permeate daily life ? Few of even us speakers of written languages are given to curling up with a dictionary and a cup of hot cocoa on a blustery night . Speakers of oral languages commonly use one of the world 's " big " languages for reading and writing . // But these " Berlitz " languages are very much the exception among the 6,000 . Only about two hundred languages are regularly taught in writing to children , and only about half of them are represented by piles of works on a wide range of subjects to the extent that we could say that they have a literature . For most of the languages in the world , if you learn it , it 'd better be in order to talk to its speakers , a lot-because there 's barely anything in it to read . Language is talked . If it 's written , that 's just an accident . // Literates Do n't Know They 're Wet : // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to see the oral languages as undeveloped , not measuring up to the state achieved by the written ones . Think of the frequent designation of such languages , quietly condescending , as " dialects " or " tongues . " But since speech rather than writing is what all humans share , we can also see the oral languages as representing the bedrock of what human language consists of . And that bedrock is something quite different from what we are conditioned to see as what language is . Casual language and formal language are different animals , much more so than we are usually aware of on a conscious level , especially those of us in highly literate , First World societies . // How Many Words Can You Know ? // For example , the multivolume , shelf-straining Oxford English Dictionary contains about 500,000 words . If we added all slang words and acronyms , the count would hit about a million . Written languages with substantial literatures tend to have vocabularies of comparable size . But this is a mere historical contingency , printing having allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indelibly and thus passed down as eternal " parts of the language . " It is significant that no one person knows all of those million words in English . Estimates of how many words individuals control are tricky and controversial , but even those for highly educated people average somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 . And even they learned these from a lifetime 's engagement with the printed page-as humanity goes , a recent appearance of a highly artificial nature , and available to an elite few . // But in " real " ( that is , oral ) languages , as new words and meanings enter a language , they often ease old ones aside . And these old words , without the artifice of writing to preserve them , gradually vanish from communal memory instead of living on as useless synonyms ( lift versus raise ) or obscure alternates ( dipsomaniac , which now has an air of Fitzgerald about it , versus alcoholic ) . // We can see words hovering between the life support of big dictionaries and utter disappearance in the language used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Congo ( Zaire ) . The drum language is not ordinary conversation , but a poetic , formulaic level of speech , and no living person recalls the meaning of many of its words . The words were current when the formulas were composed , but have since faded away except when caught , like flies in a window screen , in the special , archaic , drum talk . For English speakers , nursery rhymes provide some rough equivalents-what exactly is a tuffet ? And if there were no dictionary to remind us , would we have any way of knowing ? Ethan Allen does n't sell tuffets. // ( Continues ... ) //
