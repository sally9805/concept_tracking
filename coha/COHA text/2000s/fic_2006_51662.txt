MY WIFE AND SON DIED ONE YEAR AGO in a boating accident on the Schuylkill River . I was n't there when they drowned , yet I have a vivid memory of what happened that day in my absence . Mornings , when I walk along the river bank , the dog happy rolling in silt or splashing in runoff from a recent snowmelt , I can see not only what 's above the dark , brackish water-a dead tree stump snagged in the trunk of the river , a red scarf someone must have dropped from the expressway above-but I can see , or imagine I can , what 's below the water , the river 's entire understory , all the low-lying vegetation : shrubs , small trees , grasses and forbs . My wife 's wedding ring , which had been loose since she took up crew and lost weight , is somewhere at the bottom of the river . That the ring is down there does n't make me sad as much as angry : with the river for being a river , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you that I 'm angry with a lot of things , especially with my son , but it always comes back to me-that I should have been there . Textbook survivor 's guilt , I know , but truly , I should have been there . <p> When I imagine their deaths , I begin a few moments before my son falls into the river . I see him leaning over the stern , staring at something bright in the water . I try my best not to become angry with him for leaning over the water when he 's been told over and over never to do so , or with my wife for not making sure our son properly fastened his life vest . In my mind , he stays in this position for a very long time : I want to keep him there , to stave off what I know happens next . I try to see this moment through his eyes : There 's something very bright beneath the water , probably on the bottom but seemingly close enough to touch . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a piece of jewelry , a diamond bracelet slipped off a woman 's wrist , a ruby necklace : No , this light is so bright he ca n't quite connect it to anything his twelve-year-old brain knows the name of . He thinks to ask his mother if she sees it , if she knows what it is , but he does n't want to share it yet ; he fears that if he mentions it or if his mother is able to name it , it will disappear . He reaches for the light even though he knows he ca n't touch it without falling ; he feels happy and safe , heavy and weightless at the same time ; he reaches , the light is pulling him , and then he falls into the water and everything goes black except the light , which he finds himself floating toward . There is no panic , no rush to breathe . My wife hears the splash and turns to see that Max is gone . She calls his name , keeps calling , spins in place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once to see if she can see anything . She gives him enough time to resurface , probably not enough time , but she ca n't wait any longer and jumps into the water , which is dark and autumn-cold , though she does n't care about cold or anything except finding Max . Panicked , she ca n't hold her breath very long , so she comes up for air , looks in every direction , sees nothing , feels the beginning of a cramp in her leg but does n't care , goes back down again , kicks violently in the water so as to create a commotion Max might see , someone might see . The second time she comes up for air she screams for help-her lungs hurt almost as much from screaming as from holding her breath . About one hundred yards away she sees another scull , two people rowing . She screams again , waves her arms , goes down . By the time she kicks her way to the bottom , only ten or twelve feet deep , she 's out of breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ; she imagines his body involuntarily breathing when it runs out of air , his lungs filling with water , and this is in fact what happens . The water is so dark that the third time she comes up for air she hits her head on the bottom of the scull . A sharp and sudden pain , then her body relaxes : The pain in her head is someone else 's , the woman sinking through the water is someone she vaguely recognizes . Her last conscious thought is that her son will be OK : The men in the boat heard her call for help and will be able to find him before he drowns . <p> By the time they find Max he 's been under the water for ten minutes ; they find my wife a few minutes later . The men pull them up onto their boat and call 9-1-1 from a cell phone . Neither is breathing , neither has a pulse ; so the young men quickly row to the riverbank , where they have enough room to lay my wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . After five minutes the man working on my son begins to hyperventilate . The man working on my wife-for reasons even he has n't been able to articulate other than to say that he had a gut feeling-stops CPR on my wife and starts on Max . A few minutes later he feels a pulse , then goes back to my wife , but neither he nor the emergency medical technicians nor the doctors in the emergency room can make her breathe again . On the way to the hospital they lose Max , then bring him back , then lose him again . <p> At the funeral Max kept telling people that the body in the casket was n't his mother , that the church and the people inside the church were n't real , that everything in the universe was nothing more than a thought . If he noticed someone crying , he told them that everything was all right , there was no such thing as death . He kept saying , " My mother went home . " <p> People asked me if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them I did n't know , which was the truth . I did n't know anything beyond the funeral . <p> But the funeral ended , as all funerals do , and we had to go home . I asked Max how he was feeling , and he said , " Fine . " <p> " I mean how do you feel about your mother being gone . " <p> " She is n't gone , " he said . " We 're the ones who are gone . " <p> When I asked him what he meant , he said , " None of this is real . You , me , this planet . We 're down here in a kind of video game . " <p> " You 're real , " I told him . " Look at me , " I said . " I 'm right here in front of you . I 'm real . " <p> " You 're just a thought , " he said . <p> " Whose thought ? " <p> " God 's . " <p> " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything alive , " he said . " We 're like God because we make things happen just by thinking . " <p> " Did someone think your mother dead ? " <p> " Yes , " he said . <p> " Was it me ? " <p> " No , " he said . " It was God . It 's always God . " <p> I grabbed his hand and squeezed ; his expression did n't change . " Do you feel this ? " I said . " This is real . This is n't a thought . " <p> " What you 're doing right now is just a thought , " he said . " It does n't even hurt . " <p> I squeezed harder , but his face showed no sign of pain ; I squeezed harder-for a moment as hard as I could-but he did n't cry out , did n't even wince , and I was sure that if I kept squeezing I would break his hand , so I stopped . <p> " I do n't want to hear any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry , and immediately I hugged him and told him I was sorry , it was OK to be sad that his mother was gone , he did n't need to pretend anymore . <p> " I 'm not crying for her , " he said . " I 'm crying for you . I 'm sad because you do n't know what I know . " <p> A week later , Max 's first back at school , his principal called : Max was saying strange things in class ; the other children were frightened of him . This was difficult to believe ; the only times my wife and I had been called to school were when other kids were picking on Max . He had always been a timid boy-afraid to sleep in his own bed , afraid of the dark , of the basement , of loud noises , of squirrels and mice and bugs . One of the few things he had n't been afraid of was dogs , which is why we got one ; another was water , which is why we took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to be afraid of anything . He offered to go into the basement to put wash in the dryer ; he no longer slept with a nightlight . His teachers used to tell us that Max did n't speak in class unless called on ; when called on , he stuttered , his voice shook . Now he spoke more than any other student , but the teachers were concerned about what he was saying ; some of the students had told their parents , who had complained . In science class , during a discussion of cells , Max explained that everything in the universe is in every cell , and that when people die they all go back to the same place , where they become each other . In history class , when the teacher asked who knew the dates of the American Revolution , Max said that the American Revolution is taking place right now , that everything that has ever happened in the history of the universe is happening simultaneously , that there 's no such thing as time as we know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be best if Max took a few more weeks before returning to school , especially given everything that had happened . <p> When I picked up Max from school , he said , " I 'm sorry about some of the things I 've been saying , but I ca n't help myself . It 's like someone else is speaking through me . " <p> " It 's OK , " I said . " We 'll talk about it when we get home . " <p> " I 'm making things difficult for you , " he said . <p> " Things are difficult , " I said , " but it 's not you . " <p> I tried to start the car , but the engine did n't make a sound . I kept turning the key . <p> " It 's the battery , " Max said . <p> " It 's not the battery , " I said . " I just got a new one less than a month ago . " <p> I got out of the car and slammed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are the only things I know how to do , then tried again . There was no response , the car was clearly dead , but I kept turning the key as if something new would happen . After a few minutes of this I punched the dashboard , then closed my eyes and put my face against the wheel . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Max said . <p> " It 's not your fault . " <p> " I ca n't help it , " he said . <p> " Do n't worry about school , " I said . " We 're going to take a few more weeks before you go back . " <p> " It 's the battery , " he said . " Sometimes I ca n't help it . " <p> " You did n't do anything to the car . " <p> " Look at your watch , " he said . <p> " It 's a watch , " I said . <p> " Look at the second hand . " <p> " So what , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's me , " he said . " Every computer I tried to use at school today crashed . When I walked into the classroom , the lights flickered . " <p> " That 's a coincidence , " I said . <p> " There 's no such thing , " he said . He got out of the car and stepped away from the curb . " Try it now , " he said . <p> " Do n't be silly , " I said . " Get in the car . " <p> " Try it . " <p> " Get back in this car . " <p> " I want you to try it . " <p> " Get in , " I said . " Now . " <p> " You 're afraid to try , " he said . " If you just turn the key , I 'll tell you everything . " <p> I turned the key . <p> He was leaning over the stern , reaching for the light-who knows what it was ? - and as soon as his hand touched the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt at peace sinking toward the light , which he could no longer see , but could feel . After a few minutes surrounded by this light he felt himself floating up until he was above the water . He could see his body clearly near the bottom , and that was how he knew he was dead . He was n't frightened ; he felt no concern for his body . When he saw his mother come up for air and call to the men for help , he tried to speak to her . He said , " Hey , I 'm up here . You do n't need to save me . I 'm up here , I 'm OK . " But his mother could n't hear him , so she went under again . He could see everything at the same time , he told me . He could see the dirt beneath his body 's fingernails ; he could count the grains of sand under the water , the scales on every fish , the pebbles along the riverbank , the hairs on his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other boat were saying . One asked the other if he knew CPR , and the other said yes . One 's name was Doug , the other Mark , and Max knew this because he could see their names written on their life vests . " I was dead , " he said , " but I was having fun . All I had to do was think about something and I could see it , I could be there at the same time I was above the water . I thought of you , and I saw you lying in bed , reading a magazine . You were wearing gray sweatpants . The phone rang and you answered it and it was a woman calling about a credit card . You took a shower but forgot to bring a towel into the bathroom ; you had to drip through the hallway to get one . " <p> Max heard a voice telling him to look down at his body ; he did so and was able to see every artery and vein , and immediately he understood how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see his body turning cold and the blood rushing to his brain . As soon as he formed the thought " Where am I going ? " he found himself inside a long , dark tube , and at the end of the tube was a tiny dot of light . It was like floating in space , he said , and the light was the only star in the universe , but so far away it was a speck . He felt someone with him in the tube , even though he could n't see this person , and he was n't afraid . Any questions he thought to ask were answered before he had a chance to ask them . He wanted to know where he was going , and immediately he started moving through the tube faster than anything , even light , could ever move , or maybe the light was coming toward him , he was n't sure , but it was getting bigger and brighter , so bright it would blind human eyes , but he understood that he was no longer human-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he reached the end of the tube , he was bathed in light and felt ... " Humans do n't have words for it , " he said . " Imagine the best feeling you 've ever had , then times it by one million , and still that 's not enough . <p> " There was a Light Being , " he told me . " He looked like a man , but was sort of see-through . And I knew him . He was like my father and my mother and my best friend , and he knew everything about me . Then he showed me my entire life ; it was like a movie , but it was happening all at once . I saw every second of my life and knew every thought I 'd ever had-but not only that . I could actually feel exactly what I felt and what everyone around me felt . There were so many things I did n't even remember . Like I was able to see myself coming out of Mom , and I felt exactly what she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fan and you had to drive me to the hospital , and I could feel how worried you were and how angry you were with me , and I 'm sorry for that . But I never felt like I was being punished by seeing these things . The Light Being was with me , and whenever I saw something that was difficult , like you and Mom fighting , he sort of paused the movie and loved me . There 's no judgment . The Light Being told me that we 're just in Earth school for a very brief period of time , and then we report back to the Light about what we learned . " <p> " It was just chemicals in your brain , " I told him . " I 've read about this . When people almost die , the brain releases chemicals and it makes you have a kind of dream . " <p> " This is the dream , " he said . " Why do n't you believe me ? " <p> " I believe you saw what you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God . " <p> " I believe in science , " I said . " Science can be a kind of god . " <p> " Look at my face , " he said . <p> " It 's a pretty nice face , " I said . " I love this face . " <p> He lifted his bangs . " Look here . " <p> " Your scar , " I said . <p> " I deleted it , " he said . " When I was watching how I got the scar , how Paul Gruber tripped me in first grade and I hit my head on the sidewalk , I asked the Light Being if I could erase that from my life , and he said yes . But the amazing part was that I was able to know exactly what Paul was feeling when he tripped me ; I knew everything about him , the problems he had , what his parents were like , why he tried to hurt me . I was me , but at the same time I was him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You have hundreds of senses , not just five , and there are colors that do n't exist here . We were standing in a garden with fat plants I 'd never seen before , and I was able to become one of these plants and know what that feels like . This world is n't real , " he said . " It 's just an illusion for our souls to have experiences in . " <p> " Did you see your mother ? " <p> " No , " he said . " I asked about her , and the Light Being told me that he had come for her , to take her home , but that I needed to go back . We did n't have to say any of this , we just communicated with our thoughts . I started to cry because I did n't want to leave , but he told me that I had to come back to help people , and only when I 'm finished can I go back . As soon as I accepted this , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like my body weighed a million pounds , and the pain in my chest was so bad I wanted to go back to the light . " <p> We were supposed to have gone rowing together , as we did most Saturdays , May through October , but my wife and I had had a fight and I was hurt and knew I could hurt her back by not going . The fight began the night before , when Gate had fallen asleep and I had to walk the dog even though it was n't my turn . We live in a fourth-floor walk-up , and walking the dog at night , especially when it 's cold or raining , is more of a chore than it ought to be . You have to get dressed , if you 're not dressed , put on shoes , a coat ; you have to negotiate an umbrella and the dog and the dog 's poop ; you give up on the umbrella and get wet while the dog takes her time sniffing every tree and pole ; you have to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , where the dog might decide to poop again . All this is painfully beside-the-point now ; all this is embarrassingly meaningless . The point is that I did n't want to go , I wanted to keep painting ; and when I saw Gate sleeping , I became angry . I made as much noise as possible while getting dressed-dropped my keys , slammed the closet door-and when Gate woke and asked what I was doing , I said , " Walking the dog , " but in a tone of voice such that Gate would know that I was annoyed . She asked me if I wanted her to go with me , and I said , Tm already dressed , why should you get dressed if I 'm already dressed ? " and she said , " Are you mad ? " and I said , " No , it 's just that I have a lot of work to do this weekend , " and she said , " You sound like you 're mad , " and I said , " I 'm not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a lot lately , and all she wants to do is sniff , she 's obsessed with sniffing , and we 're out there for a half hour , and it 's raining , and by the way , did you leave the kitchen window open-the last time you left the kitchen window open and it rained , we had a puddle on the floor . " Gate got up and put on her jeans . When I asked her what she was doing , she said , " Walking the dog , " and I said , " No , you 're not , " and she said , " Then I 'm coming with you , " and I said , " The reason we take turns is so that only one of us has to go , " and she said , " I do n't want you holding this over me , " and I said , " You 're just trying to make me feel bad , " and she said , " I did n't think it would be a big deal if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " This happens all the time " and she said , " I get tired earlier than you . What am I supposed to do about that ? Drink coffee at night so I can be awake when the dog needs to go out ? " " I do n't want you coming , " I told her , and she said , Tm coming , " and I said , " Gate , I swear , you always do this-you 're trying to make me feel bad , " and she said , " Lower your voice , " and I said , " Max ca n't hear us , " and she said , " I do n't care . " <p> This was the kind of fight we used to work out before going to bed : We would argue and yell , then for a few hours we would ignore each other , sit silently in different rooms , but eventually we would figure out that the fight was really about jealousy or insecurity or some other human fear . Fighting with Cate was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of us are struggling to open the window-we 're pulling and pulling-but every time one of us opens the window an inch , the other closes it again , and soon we become afraid that we 'll never be able to open the window , but we keep trying , and just when we 're about to give up , something gives and the window opens and light shines into the room . We used to write in a notebook what we learned from each fight-what we would do differently the next time-and we made fun of ourselves for doing this though it worked for us . But after Max was born , we made a pact never to fight in front of him , and it took longer to open the window . <p> We walked the dog in silence , Cate a few feet behind me , both of us too stubborn to use the one umbrella we owned . I did n't wear a jacket , thinking that the wetter I got , the worse Cate would feel , but Cate one-upped me : She wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drainpipe leaking rainwater . If I could have managed to twist my ankle or throw out my back or get hit by a car , I would have . I remember feeling a small victory-what seems to me now the pettiest of victories-in being the one to hold the leash and to pick up after the dog . When we got home , Cate and I undressed , then lay awake in bed , back to back , but not touching . <p> We woke the next morning strangers , neither willing to be the first to speak . I went into my studio and closed the door . I was painting the river from photographs I 'd taken in a friend 's plane . In the photo , the landscape below looked like the inside of a human body-the river an artery running through the land-but my painting was lifeless , and I hated myself and my wife and my son and the dog and the classes I had to teach to help pay bills and anything else I might blame for the paint being dead on the canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max asked her if I was coming , and she said , " I do n't know . Ask your father . " When he asked me , I told him I had too much work to do . As they started down the stairs , I imagined Cate falling , what that might sound like-a broken leg or neck would put a quick end to our fight . When I heard the door open outside , I went to the window and looked down . I thought of calling to her , not to apologize-I was n't big enough for that-but maybe to say , " Hey lady , you forgot your husband , " something corny my wife would translate as , " I do n't like you right now , but I love you . We 'll work it out when you get home . " But when I opened the window , she did n't look up , and by the time I decided to say something , they were halfway down the street . <p> During the two weeks before Max went back to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed faces on the backs of bill envelopes ; one of them looked like me , but much older . I bought him colored pencils and a sketch pad . He 'd never enjoyed art in school , and everything he 'd brought home had been stick figures or blobs of paint we pretended to know all along were people or ducks or skyscrapers . Now he was leaving drawings on the kitchen counter , in the magazine rack , inside my art books : gardens with flowers as tall as houses ; dots of light he said were souls awaiting rebirth into the material world . He drew our galaxy as if seen from millions of light-years away , and other planets , too , one all water , another all grass , another made entirely of giant trees growing out of ice and snow . When I asked him when he learned to draw so well , he said , " I 've always been able to . I just did n't believe it . I can do anything , you know . " <p> " Can you slam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to . " <p> " I do n't want to know if you want to . I want to know if you can . " <p> " If I truly wanted to , I could . " <p> " I do n't think you could . " <p> " We 'll never know because I do n't want to . " <p> " Why would n't you want to ? I have dreams about being able to dunk . " <p> " Then you should dunk . " <p> " Impossible , " I said . " I 'm too short . " <p> " If that 's what you think . " <p> " If you can do anything , can you read Chinese ? " <p> " If I wanted to , I could . But I do n't . God does n't need me to ; otherwise , I would have been born Chinese . " <p> " Can you perform brain surgery ? " <p> " Do n't need to . That 's why God made brain surgeons . " <p> " Can you live forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't even need to try . " <p> " Can you bring back the dead ? " <p> " Bring them back where ? They 're already where they 're supposed to be . " <p> " Max , I might need you to talk to someone . " <p> " You mean a therapist . " <p> " I just want to do the right thing . I want to make sure you 're all right . " <p> He pointed to his head , above his nose and between his eyes . " Do you know who lives here ? " he said . " God lives here . " <p> We took the dog for a walk along the river every morning just before sunrise . Max would sit on the bank and draw the river , a train passing , cars on the expressway above ; and he would draw tiny people in the cars , and you could make out the shapes of their eyes and noses-that 's how good he was . On one of these mornings we passed a young woman walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , like a basketball player , and wore her hair in a ponytail . Her jeans were tight and had no pockets , front or back . She was n't wearing a wedding ring . While the dogs were sniffing each other , Max said to the woman , " You need to go see your doctor . " <p> " Max , " I said . <p> " Seriously , " he said . " She needs to see her doctor . " <p> The woman laughed . " What an odd thing to say ! " <p> Max opened his sketch pad . " Look , " he said . " I drew you yesterday . " <p> " She has long hair , " I said . " The woman you drew is bald . " <p> " That looks like me , " she said . " I mean , it does n't not look like me . She 's tall , and she has a dog that looks like my dog . " <p> " Do you walk your dog here every day ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He must have seen you . " <p> " Did not , " Max said . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said to the woman . <p> " Do I look that unhealthy ? " <p> " No , " Max said . " It 's just that-I do n't want to scare you , but you should see your doctor right away . There 's something wrong . " <p> " Max , " I said . " That 's enough . " <p> " I was just trying to help . " <p> I took the woman aside . " He recently lost his mother , " I said . " Sometimes he says strange things . " <p> " It 's OK , " she said . " He 's just a boy . " <p> It was n't yet light out , and no one else was there , so we let the dogs off their leashes . They chased each other in the shallow part of the river , living in the present the way dogs do , then came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry about your wife , " the woman said . <p> " It 's only been a few weeks , " I said . <p> " Do n't worry about what your son said . " <p> The pills I took slowed life to a crawl . Two a day , then three , then four . There were neither highs nor lows ; life was something that happened around the bubble I found myself in . When the last pill I 'd taken began to wear off , I could feel the bubble about to pop ; once the bubble popped , the world became a strange , unsafe place . I was frightened of grapefruits and garbage trucks , of the sound of Max 's electric pencil sharpener . That such things as tomatoes or cucumbers existed , that they grew from the earth , seemed absurd . I did n't like looking at noses , especially my own . I stopped shaving , went days without bathing or changing my clothes . Without the pills I would have had a breakdown . I suppose I was having one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown : I was able to bring Max to school in the morning and pick him up in the afternoon ; I was able to go grocery shopping . I was n't able to teach and had no interest in painting , but a few days a week I went up in the plane with my friend Scott to take more photographs . I used to get nervous before we took off , and only after I started taking pictures would I calm down , but now I was afraid more of my own knuckles-the faces I would see in them-than of being in a rickety single-engine plane at one thousand feet . One morning I dropped my camera-I had n't dropped one in years-and if I could have watched it all the way down , I would have . I wanted to see it smash into pieces , but it simply disappeared as it fell . Scott asked me if I wanted to call it a day , but I told him no , I did n't want to go down yet . Ten minutes later he asked me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thirty , forty minutes , but I could n't imagine saying yes , I 'm ready to go back down . Then the plane nose-dived , or rather Scott sent the plane into a nose dive . He did this the first time we went up , a few years earlier , and I 'd gotten sick and told him never to do it again . Now , even though I told myself I did n't care what happened , I found myself grabbing the seat back in front of me . Despite our intentions , there 's very little we can do about instincts that have been encoded in our cells for aeons-the urge to hold on , to live . Scott pulled the plane out of the dive , then asked me if I was ready to go down now , which I was . <p> I did n't recognize her at first because she was wearing a hat , but I remembered her dog . It was snowing on top of the snow from the week before that had n't yet melted ; it had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , I turned around and walked away . She called to us , " Hey , wait ! Hey , I need to talk to you ! " I pretended not to hear her . <p> " Hey ! " she said . " You with the German shepherd . " <p> We kept walking , but eventually she caught up . <p> " I want to talk to you , " she said . She looked at Max . " Actually , I want to talk to you . I went to see my doctor , just like you said , and I had a brain aneurism . The doctor was shining his little flashlight in my eyes and he did n't like what he saw , so he gave me all these neurological tests-squeeze my hand , look over here , look over there , touch your finger to your nose-and then they gave me a brain scan , and the next thing I knew I was having surgery . " She took off her hat to show us the scar . She was so tall she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had to shave here , where they cut , but it looked ridiculous , so I shaved the rest . I actually like it , " she said . " Today is the first morning I 've been out with the dog since the surgery , and I was hoping I 'd run into you . " She touched Max 's arm . " I wanted to thank you . " <p> " I did n't do anything . " <p> " But how did you know ? " <p> " He did n't , " I said . " It was just a coincidence . " <p> " There 's no such thing , " Max said . <p> " Max , " I said . " Not now . " <p> " I should be allowed to say what I believe , " he said . <p> " I 'm happy you 're doing OK , " I said to her . <p> " My vision was n't so good for the first few days-I was seeing three of everything-but I 'm back to normal now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Listen , " she said . " I 'd like to have you and your son over for dinner . " <p> " There 's no need . " <p> " Or we could go out to eat , " she said . " Its the least I can do for your son saving my life . " <p> " It was just something he said . " <p> " They have dogs that can smell cancer , " she said . " Why ca n't your son know when a person is sick ? " <p> " It was God , " Max said . <p> " Does God speak to you ? " she said . <p> " You can know everything , if you want . There are signs everywhere . All you have to do is pay attention . " <p> " Let me ask you something , " she said . " I have a very close friend who 's sick . If you met her , would you be able to- " <p> " He 's not the second Coming , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong thing , " she said . " I was only wondering-Well , I just wanted to thank your son and invite you over for dinner . " <p> " Thank you , " I said , " but I 'm not feeling very well lately . I do n't think it 's the best time . " <p> " If you change your mind , " she said . <p> I woke one morning , a few days before Christmas , certain that I was going to die . Not then , but at some point during the day . I imagined Max raised by Gate 's sister in New York , that he would have a better life with her than with me . It was as if I had figured out how a sad story I was reading might have a happy ending . Max would be the kid whose parents died two months apart when he was twelve , yet look at how well he 's done : an artist , like his father , or a doctor , a scientist , a writer , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life , two strangers he talked about years later when he had his own children . My mother drowned when she tried to save me ; my father died in his sleep , from grief . It could be a romantic story . What better way to make up for the last fight we 'd had than to die so soon after Gate died ? I had no idea how to live other than putting food in my mouth and chewing-and even that was n't so easy-yet I had a son , and would therefore have to continue getting out of bed and washing my body and my hair and brushing my teeth and finding matching socks and walking the dog and picking up the dog 's shit , and God how happy the dog was sniffing other dogs ' asses , so excited to smell pee on a pole , and I would never fall in love-I could care for someone , I could have sex , but never again marry or fall in love-and that was OK , I 'd already accepted this role , the widower whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Max came into my room as chipper as ever-he 'd spoken with his mother during the night , or rather she 'd spoken with him . He woke to see her beside his bed . When he tried to touch her , she told him he could n't . She told him that for the rest of his life he would never be alone , she would always watch over him , but this was the last time he would be able to see her for a long time . I wanted to ask Max if there was a message for me-Do n't worry about the fight , you can let it go now-but I did n't want to give him the satisfaction ; I did n't want him to know that he had something I wanted . Or maybe he did n't have anything ; people have dreams and think they 're seeing ghosts . I 'm not sure what I believe , really . But Max believed , and that 's all that mattered . <p> When he finished his story , I got up , got dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though I did n't ask him to . He kept asking me if I wanted him to take the leash . Did I want him to pick up the poop ? Did I want him to get me some coffee ? Did I want the paper ? When we stopped by the river and I let the dog run into the water , Max asked me if I was angry . I told him no even though I was . He asked me again . I threw a stick into the river and the dog fetched . I threw farther . The dog ran until the water was too deep to run in , then she swam for the stick and brought it back . I threw farther ; the dog fetched . Max asked me again if I was angry , and I threw the stick as far as I could-so far that the dog stopped swimming and turned around . We stood there and watched the stick be pulled away by the current until we could no longer see it . <p> Max said , " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> I did n't answer . <p> He said , " Are you angry because I 'm not as sad as you are ? " <p> I started to walk home along the train tracks beside the river ; Max and the dog followed . I stood on the tracks even though I heard the train 's whistle in the distance . <p> Max said , " Are you angry because I 'm alive ? " <p> " Yes , " I said . " Yes , yes , yes , I 'm very angry . I 'm so angry I do n't know what I might do . " <p> Max kneeled beside the dog to pet her , which is what he does when he 's crying , or about to . <p> " Not because you 're alive , " I said . " Not that . It 's just that- . Do n't cry , " I said , " I want you to be alive . " <p> I knew Max wanted to go , so we went . I took an extra pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Rae , lived a few blocks away in a trinity , a three-story row house so narrow there 's only one room on each floor : living room on one , kitchen on two , bedroom on three . There was another woman there , as short as Rae was tall , whom Rae introduced as her sister , Susan . I 'm not sure why she introduced her lover as her sister , but I could see photos of them around the house , their arms around each other , lying together in a hammock on the beach , kissing . Susan was very thin and her clothes were too big ; it was obvious to me that she was sick . She walked like someone who should have been walking with a cane . Her face was much too young for someone with gray hair . <p> Rae set out cheese and crackers and olives , but Max was the only one who ate . The extra pill made me able to tolerate small talk-how long had we been living in Philadelphia , where did I grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I like to paint , and so on . Every time I looked at Susan , she was looking at Max . She sat with her hands folded on her lap , and her eyes were the shade of blue people call ice blue . <p> She asked Max , " What do you like in school ? " <p> " Do you mean regular school or Earth school ? " <p> She looked at Rae , then at me . " What 's Earth school ? " <p> " Everything , " Max said . " Dinner tonight . Walking the dog . Taking a shower . Having an argument . " <p> " In that case , what do you like about Earth school ? " <p> " Many things , " he said . " My top-top might be the taste of certain foods , like cherries , pineapple , any kind of cheese , especially Swiss cheese , and olives . " He showed her the olive he was about to eat , a black thimble on his finger . " Also toptop would be when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs with a ball in her mouth . Sometimes it 's a shoe or a sock . She does that when my dad comes home , too . " <p> " What about regular school ? " <p> " Regular school is just part of Earth school . I like numbers because they 're just numbers . Like the number three is just the number three ; it does n't have to be three apples or oranges or anythings . And I like history even though there 's no such thing as history or time . " <p> " Max , " I said . " Stop playing with your food . " He ate the five olives on his fingers , then covered his mouth while he chewed . <p> I could smell fish cooking upstairs in the kitchen . Susan asked Max if he wanted to go with her to check on the potatoes . She put her hand on his back and walked up the stairs behind him . Rae put on music that sounded like monks chanting , then closed her eyes . Whatever their mantra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened her eyes , I was staring at her . <p> " God lives here , " she said . <p> " Here ? " <p> " That 's what they 're saying . That God lives here , wherever here is . " <p> " I guess God gets around . " <p> " It 's Susans tape , " she said . " Do you want me to turn it off ? " <p> " No , it 's just that I 'm not feeling very well . May I use your bathroom ? " <p> " All the way upstairs-the floor after the floor with the kitchen . " <p> On my way upstairs I saw Susan kneeling in front of Max . It looked like she was about to tie his shoelace , but her eyes were closed . She was taking deep breaths through her nose . I stood at the top of the stairs and watched . Smoke rose from the pan and gathered near the light above the stove . I did n't want to move or make a sound ; I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , I wanted to see it . She kept breathing deeply and slowly . The kitchen filled with smoke , but I did n't move . <p> And then I saw Susan reach out and take Max 's hand . He was standing one shoe on top of the other , his anxious position . I had n't seen him stand this way since his mother died . Susan held Max 's hand near her mouth and breathed into it , or maybe she was saying something into it ; I 'm not sure . Then she opened his hand and pressed it against her breast . She held it there for a moment , then moved it under her arm , down her side , and back to her breast . There was nothing sexual about this-in fact , she was crying-and I did n't move to stop her . Instead , I found myself imagining that I was the one on my knees in front of my son and that I was holding his hand against my chest , where it hurt , and that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he could help , that I would let him help me feel whatever peace he 'd found on the other side of this life , or wherever he went , real or imagined , when he 'd died . <p> But I felt once removed from what he 'd experienced and from what he 'd brought back with him : his ability to know things it 's impossible to know , and his strange ideas , which I suppose are n't so strange after all . If my wife can be taken from me , if the life I 'd thought was ours can so suddenly be taken , then why ca n't this be happening ? Why not my son 's hand on this woman 's breast ? Why not the boy 's father watching but saying nothing ? <p> The smoke detector frightened Max and he pulled away his hand . Susan saw me and stood . I went into the kitchen , stood on a chair , and removed the smoke detector 's battery . Susan opened a window and fanned smoke with her arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The fish burned , " I said . <p> " It 's OK , " Rae said . " I can make something else . " <p> " Actually we 're going to leave now . " <p> " But you have n't eaten . Let me boil some pasta at least . " <p> " We 're going to leave now , " I said . <p> " Listen , " Susan said . " What you saw was n't what you think . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Max said . " Did I do something wrong ? " <p> " No , " I told him . " You did n't do anything wrong . No one did . But we 're going to leave . " <p> " I 'm very sick , " Susan said . <p> " I know . " <p> " I was trying to . . . I was only hoping . . . I 'm scared , " she said . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . <p> " Your son has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him use it . " <p> " He can heal just by touching , " Susan said . " I felt it just now . " <p> " He 's a boy , " I said , " and he lost his mother . " <p> Downstairs the monks were still chanting mantras I could n't understand . I kept hearing them during the walk home . <p> In our mailbox was mail we 'd forgotten to pick up earlier , including a few letters addressed to Gate . I left the letters and took the rest ; I let the letters collect for a few months before I could open them . <p> The first flight up was fine , the second less so . Somewhere on the third I had to stop . <p> " Did I do something to make you cry ? " Max asked . <p> " No . " <p> " Why are you sitting here ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " I feel like I did something wrong . " <p> " You 're a good kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help people , but I ca n't remember how . He told me how . He told me everything that I 'm supposed to do and everything that will ever happen to me in my life , and to you , but I 'm forgetting everything-every day I forget a little more-but I do n't want to forget , I need to remember what I 'm supposed to do . " <p> " You 're supposed to be a boy , " I said . <p> " Do you believe what I told you ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " But do you believe ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Are you sick ? " <p> " A little bit , " I said . <p> " Where does it hurt ? " <p> " Everywhere , but not so bad that I 'll die . " <p> " Do you need a pill ? " <p> " No . " <p> " What can I do to help ? " <p> One day , before Gate and I were married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way home we had to cross the train tracks that run alongside the river , but a freight train had stopped there . We waited five minutes , maybe ten , long enough to grow impatient , though I 'm not sure why we would have been in such a rush . In retrospect , it would have been fine to stand there forever , the train blocking our path . We could have sat there , or turned around and kept walking along the river , thrown rocks , talked some more about the things we talked about then . But it was n't enough to just stand where we were ; we wanted to get to the other side , which we could n't quite see , but there were small gaps between and beneath the cars , and Gate said that the train did n't look like it was going to move though I 'm not sure how you can tell if something 's going to move or not or how anything that has n't happened is going to happen or not , and she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that I did n't think that was a good idea , and she told me that she had done this before , it was no big deal , it took ten seconds , what 's ten seconds ? , and I told her not to do it , and she said , " Watch , it 's easy , " and she started to crawl under , and while she was on her knees beneath the train , the train made a hissing noise . I reached under the train and pulled her out just before the train moved . I wanted to be angry with her but could n't . I pressed my hands against the sides of her face and brought her face close to mine and said , " Do n't ever do that again . Do n't ever do anything like that again . Do you hear me ? Promise me right now that you 'll never do anything like that ever again . " <p> " Dad , " Max said . " I 'm hungry . " <p> " Give me a minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes ago . " <p> " Give me another , " I said . <p> " Eventually we 'll have to eat . " <p> When we opened the door , it was dark and much too quiet ; I was n't used to that yet . I could see her fleece pullover hanging on the hook by the door . People tell me that I should put her clothes in a trunk in the basement , but I like to see her clothes in her closet , even now , a year later . <p> " Do n't be afraid , " Max said . " She 's not really dead . " <p> OK , " I said . " But she 's not here . " <p> Before we went inside , the dog came running with one of Gate 's clogs in her mouth . She kept running into the hallway and back inside and back into the hallway , turning in circles , surprised that no one else was there . <p> Author Affiliation             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
