<p> THERE is nothing like an expansive water view to quicken my heartbeat . Some people might dream of a park view , or the glitter of skyscrapers at night , but looking at a stretch of water  --  with cute tugboats chugging along , or a graceful flotilla of sailboats  --  is really my dream . <p> So I was excited to visit two buildings that promise spectacular views of Manhattan 's waterways . One , the 90-unit , 19-story condominium at 170 East End Avenue , between 87th and 88th Streets , was designed by the architect Peter Marino . The classical limestone-and-steel building is a skip over Carl Schurz Park and Gracie Mansion to the East River . <p> The other , the 263-unit horseshoe-shaped Riverhouse , at 1 Rockefeller Park , in Battery Park City , was designed by the Polshek Partnership , with interiors by David Rockwell . With that location , it practically sits in the Hudson River . <p> So , a couple of weeks ago , on one of those crystal-clear days that made me think I was in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I went downtown to check it out . <p> The off-site sales office for Riverhouse is dizzyingly full of information about all the energy-saving features that make the building so eco-special , including wood from renewable forests and photovoltaic cells ( solar panels to you and me ) on the roof . <p> I was also enthralled by the idea of a 600-gallon saltwater fish tank in the lobby , a billiards lounge ( there 's also one at 170 East End , so lots of people must be playing pool ) , a 3,000-square-foot fitness center , a lap pool and a media cafe stocked by City Bakery . <p> " Just the place to have an espresso before taking off for work , " said James Lansill , a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group . <p> That comment brought me back to reality . I had been thinking that with all those extras , it would be like living in a resort , and I forgot about having to go to work . <p> I stopped musing and tried to concentrate on how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with energy-saving appliances , of course ) where the always-clever Mr. Rockwell has devised an extendable countertop that flips up to become a table . I also admired the way hinged cubbies and cabinets can hide small appliances and all that other stuff you do n't want your friends to see if you 're living in such a sleek new apartment . <p> Before I got too involved with the finishes ( bamboo floors , blue lava stone sinks and marble in the bathroom that looks like teak ) , we were off to visit the building site , where construction was in full swing , and I could ride the construction elevator to the 32nd floor . The view from up there is truly jaw-dropping  --  water everywhere and a colorful cruise ship making its way out of the harbor . <p> " A woman combined two and a half apartments here , " said Mr. Lansill , pointing out how we were hovering over the Hudson with views of the Statue of Liberty , Staten Island and the hills of New Jersey . I am told that 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 percent also include views of the Statue of Liberty . <p> So far , about 49 percent of the building , which is being developed by the Sheldrake Organization , has been sold , Mr. Lansill said . Prices for one-bedroom , one-bath units and one-bedroom , two-bath units  --  865 to 1,092 square feet  --  range from $880,000 to $1.525 million , with total monthly charges in the $1,300-to-$1,800 range . Two bedrooms go from $1.185 million to $2.590 million , with monthly charges of about $1,675 to $2,620 . <p> There are also three-bedrooms  --  the top price with river views is $2.8 million  --  and a four-bedroom , three-bath unit , albeit on the third floor , for $2.975 million . <p> It 's a different vibe uptown  --  less freewheeling and more soigne . I was thinking that I might have to really pull myself together before even venturing through the pristine lobby , which will open onto a private garden courtyard with a waterfall and a family of sheep sculptures by Xavier-Francois Lalanne . ( Love them ! ) <p> Artworks by Caio Fonseca and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as do the handsome kitchens planned for the apartments . <p> " They all have white marble floors with gray inserts , bleached cherry wood veneer cabinetry with aluminum inlays , " and countertops made from Swiss quartzite , said Barbara Russo , the director of sales for the building , which is also being marketed by Corcoran Sunshine . <p> The more subdued but also elegant bathrooms ( alas , only some have windows ) have sycamore vanities with double sinks , Kohler soaking tubs , Dornbracht fittings , glass showers with handy corner shelves , and floors made of Perlino Bianco , a lovely marble . <p> " We basically had to go to all the continents to get our stones , " said Orin Wilf , the president of Skyline Developers . <p> Ms. Russo pointed out that every apartment , even the one-bedrooms , has a powder room with a good-looking Makassar ebony vanity that comes with a built-in toilet paper holder  --  Mr. Wilf was particularly enthusiastic about the architect 's attention to detail . <p> He said he is planning to move with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18th floor . " I want to live here the rest of my life , " he said . <p> Who would n't ? <p> Mr. Wilf 's apartment has , I must admit , the most fabulous views , with a living room that opens up completely to the river , the bridges and beyond . They tell me that 40 percent of the units here have unobstructed water views , and another 40 percent have treetop views of Carl Schurz Park that will become water views after the leaves fall . <p> Not surprisingly , the developer got to make some decisions that will help him avoid his pet peeves . " I do n't like to see food deliveries in the lobby because sometimes it gets too crazy , " he said , pointing out the separate service entrance and elevator for those takeout orders . <p> That 's not something I would have thought about , but it just goes to show that different people have different priorities . The developers surveyed buyers on what amenities they wanted . They ended up with that billiard room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yoga dance studio , a squash court , a 40-seat media room , an arcade with video games and a separate Pilates studio . <p> The building is 90 percent sold , Ms. Russo said . There remain a couple of one-bedrooms ( $1.495 million and $1.225 million , with monthly charges of about $1,325 , including taxes ) ; three two-bedrooms ( $2.01 million to $2.35 million , with monthly charges from $1,720 to about $2,200 ) ; a couple of town houses in the $6-to-$7-million range ; a five-bedroom , six-and-a-half-bath unit for $8.2 million ; and a $16 million penthouse with about 4,920 square feet , three balconies and a 3,655- square-foot rooftop . <p> Breakfast will be served to residents every morning in the library . " That 's continental breakfast , " Ms. Russo said , " not bacon and eggs . " <p> That 'll be just fine , thank you . <p> I could spend quite awhile debating and dreaming whether I 'd prefer to look at the East River , with its parade of bridges and view of Queens stretching out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Statue of Liberty as it welcomes voyagers to New York Harbor . <p> But it 's always my indecision about neighborhoods  --  as well as the prices one has to pay for that premium view  --  that bring me back down to earth . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
