The Untamed One By Thompson , Ronda St. Martin 's Paperbacks Thompson , Ronda The woods of Whit Hurch , England , 1821 The musket ball had passed through his shoulder . Blood seeped from the wound , warm and sticky against Jackson Wulf 's skin . The peasants of Whit Hurch were superstitious lunatics , the lot of them . They chased him now , voices raised in anger , eyes filled with bloodlust to kill him . The village folk believed that he was some kind of beast -- -a man during the daylight hours , a wolf when the moon sat round and plump in the night sky . Damn the idiots ... they were right . " There he is ! " A musket cracked . The ball splintered a tree not an inch from Jackson 's face . His fair looks were the one gift he 'd been given in his cursed life . " Not the face , you bloody bastards ! " he shouted . " Anything but the face ! " Another ball whizzed past , down lower . Not that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman 's high-pitched plea sounded behind him . " Papa , do not kill him ! I love him ! " Sweet Hollis , the barmaid at the tavern he 'd frequented these past five nights . Her father owned the tavern and the few rooms upstairs , one of which Jackson had occupied this past week . The daughter had slipped Jackson a free tankard or two behind her father 's back . She 'd also let it be known that she would n't mind Jackson slipping her a little something in return . Jackson had been tempted , as women were one of his manyweaknesses , but he 'd stayed focused upon his quest . Women were the crux of his troubles and always had been . A year prior when he 'd traveled abroad , Jackson had foolishly given his heart to a young society miss . Lady Anne Baldwin had embodied all that a proper gentleman desired in a wife . Beauty , grace , kindness . He 'd become smitten with her , and her ready friendship with a man most of society shunned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had stolen his heart or that she 'd brought his family curse down upon his head . Centuries past , all Wulf males had been cursed by a witch . Cursed by a witch , and perhaps released from the same curse by a witch 's death , Jackson was thinking . Rumors had led him to the village of Whit Hurch , where it was said a witch lived among the villagers . Through careful questions , Jackson had learned that the woman had disappeared some months ago but was thought to be hiding in the woods surrounding the village . Jackson had n't found her yet , but he had vowed that he would . His future and the future of his brothers might be tied to killing her . A riddle written within a poem left by the first cursed Wulf instructed that future Wulf males seek out their worst enemy , be brave and do not flee . If Jackson could find the witch he 'd heard once lived in the village , killing her might end the curse for him and his brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shots sounded behind him . Jackson ran until his brow was beaded with sweat . His shoulder stung and the loss of blood made him light-headed . Glancing up , he noted that the night was still a ways off . Normally , he would not wish the full moon upon himself , but now , in order to survive , he needed the wolf that would rise up inside of him . It was such a transformation , witnessed by one of the village folk last eve when he thought he was alone in the woods , that had brought him to his current predicament . Jackson could n't control it . Perhaps he might have learned to live with it if he could , but like his fondness for liquor and women , in the end he always surrendered to a force stronger than his will . No more , he had decided . Jackson 's oldest brother , Armond , had married . A marriage of convenience , or so Armond claimed , but Jackson knew better . If Armond was n't fully in love with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Jackson had decided to save them all . It was important to him to end the curse that robbed him and his brothers of a normal life . The curse that had robbed them of their parents and of their social standing among London society . Jackson had been given nothing of importance to do in his life ... nothing but this , and he would succeed . He would find the witch and he would kill her if it meant breaking the curse . But the woods were vast , and even his superior tracking skills had yet to lead him to the woman he sought . Exhausted , Jackson paused , leaning against the trunk of a tree to catch his breath . He wiped the sweat from his brow with the sleeve of his fine coat . The breeze picked up , and turning , he closed his eyes and allowed the cooler air to revive him . A scent suddenly drifted to him on the wind . It was a woman 's scent . Even slightly befuddled from blood loss , Jackson knew the scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much more attuned to sound than that of a normal man . He listened . He heard a soft moan , a slight feminine grunt , and then the sound of ragged breathing . Noises a woman might make while entertaining a lover . Was it the witch ? Jackson had trouble believing so , for in his mind the woman he sought was old and ugly . With her scraggly hair and wart-ridden face , the only way such a woman could get a man into bed with her would be to cast a spell over him . Still , her scent drew Jackson . The smell of woman , of sunshine , of earth and rain , and the subtle scent of honeysuckle and , oddly enough , blood . The sounds of heavy footfalls crushing through the brush , of voices raised in excitement for the hunt , drifted away from him , and all he heard was her . All he smelled was her . She filled him with her presence , lulled him with the soft sounds she made , and he went to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out of the trees , Jackson fought the pain of his injury , ignored the clotted feel of blood beneath his shirt , and pressed onward . The cottage he stumbled upon a while later was little more than a shack , overgrown with vines so that it was almost invisible against the thick forest wall . He neither smelled a cooking fire nor saw the tattletale rise of smoke from the cottage 's crumbling chimney . He heard no sounds of life , not even among the forest animals . Hackles rose on the back of his neck . The silence was eerie . The woman was inside ; he did sense that much . Jackson reached for the knife he kept strapped to his belt . It was not there . No knife , no weapon . Some killer he was . The village folk had surprised him . He 'd barely been able to dress and escape his lodgings over the tavern when they had come for him . If he must , he 'd kill her with his bare hands , Jackson decided . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her death meant a normal life for him and his brothers , he could do it . His resolve strengthened , Jackson crept to the cottage door and eased it open . The lighting inside was dim , but his eyesight was superior to that of a normal man . A woman tossed upon a straw mattress thrown down against the dirt floor . Her knees were bent and spread wide , her legs bare . The large mound of her belly moved beneath a soiled frock bunched around the top of her thighs . No lover did she tryst with , but with the burden of labor . Jackson 's gaze traveled up her swollen body , past the tangled mass of red curls hanging over her shoulders , to her face . Their eyes met , held , and it was as if neither could catch a breath . " So , you 've come for me at last , " she whispered . " Kill me , but do not harm the babe . He is innocent . " Hackles rose on the back of Jackson 's neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the woman he sought . The witch . His greatest enemy . But she did not look as he had pictured her in his mind . She was not old and stooped , with warts and facial hair . She was beautiful . Even covered in perspiration , her hair tangled , and her clothing worn and soiled , her beauty could not be disguised . Her eyes were the deepest shade of green , like the forest that protected her . The tangled curls that hung past her shoulders were as fiery red as a summer sunset . Although her body was now swollen with child , her bones were small and delicate . Jackson could crush her easily . " Not yet , " she said , as if reading his thoughts . " Let me deliver my child . I beg of you , do not harm him . After you 've killed me , take him to a village family . Do not tell them where you got him , only that he is alone and in need of someone to watch after him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duty . Resigned to her fate but not resigned to the fate of her child . And still , he had trouble believing this was the woman he sought . " Are you a witch ? " Her gaze narrowed . " You know that I am , " she said . " That is why you are here , is it not ? " Pain clouded her eyes before he could answer . She bit down hard on her full lower lip , bringing blood . Her belly bunched and moved and she lifted her hips and pushed but , as his eyes could plainly see , to no avail . " He 's stuck , " she finally managed to say as she lay back against the straw , gasping for breath . " The babe needs to be turned . Let me see your hands . " Dazed , by either his own blood loss , her knowledge that he would come for her , or simply having to witness a woman with spread legs in a circumstance far different than he was accustomed to , Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " she announced . " Your fingers are long and slender , your hands delicate despite your tall frame . You must put them inside of me . You must turn the babe so he will be able to make his journey . " Jackson 's fingers had been inside of a woman before , to be certain , but never for the purpose she suggested . Her plea held on appeal to him whatsoever . He frowned down at her and shook his head . " I can not , " he assured her . " I know nothing of these matters . " When pain gripped her again , she grabbed a stick and stuck it between her teeth until the pain passed . " Then do nothing , " she panted . " Stand and watch me die , and the child along with me . It will be easier than having to kill us later . " What she said was true enough . Jackson had never raised a violent hand to a woman in his life . That thought had teased him throughout his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to break the curse . He 'd known to emerge victorious he must kill her , but the killing , he 'd never allowed himself to dwell upon that ... to question whether he was capable . Had fate played into his hands ? But if nature stole her life and he did not , would the curse still be broken ? It suddenly occurred to Jackson that if there was a child , there was a man . Jackson sniffed the air but caught no scent that anyone except the woman had inhabited the cottage . " Where is the babe 's father ? " he asked . Her eyes widened slightly . " You do not know ? He did not send you ? " Confused , he shook his head . " No . I 've come to kill you for my own reasons . Your foul deeds against my family , or at least the deeds of your kind . " Her labor took whatever response she might have made . Her back arched . Her belly lifted , rippling beneath her gown . A low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw , with all her strength , which was n't much , and again , nothing happened . " Have you a weapon ? " she panted . Rather shamefaced , he answered , " No . " The woman frowned . Her pain-filled gaze ran the length of him . " Then it was with your hands you intended to kill me . " She struggled up upon her elbows . " Do so now . If you wo n't put them inside of me , put them around my throat . End this suffering for me . Without your help , the babe and I are doomed anyway . " Mercy killing ? To Jackson , it sounded so much better than outright murder . He should end her suffering . Seeing her pain brought him no pleasure , no sense of justice . It sickened him . But to kill her so that her suffering might end ... he could live with that , could n't he ? He swayed slightly with dizziness as he approached her straw mattress . Jackson kept his gaze averted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might please him immensely under different circumstances . He knelt beside her . She stared up at him , pain evident in her eyes but not fear . God , she had more courage than he did . " Do it , " she urged , then tilted her head back , allowing him access to her slim throat . " I have long suspected that my differences would someday lead me to this end . I accept my fate . " The woman 's passiveness angered him . Where were her instincts for survival ? Where was her rage that she had been given a life different from everyone else 's ? Why did she offer him her throat when she should be fighting him to the bitter end ? Perhaps she deserved to die . If she valued life so little , why not oblige her ? Her skin was soft , warm beneath his fingers when he wrapped them around her neck . The contact caused a spark , like the air fraught with tension before a storm . She felt it , as well , for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened . " You are different , too , " she whispered . " You are not a man . But neither are you a beast . You are both . " There was no call to deny her claims , if Jackson was a little unnerved that she saw him for what he was . His face had served him well in the past -- -a disguise that hid his darker nature . " I will be a man again , " he assured her . " And nothing but a man when you die by my hand . " She moistened her lips , and he noticed how ripe and pink they were despite the abuse she 'd put them through . " But what sort of man will you be ? " Her unsettling eyes , slanted , almost feline , studied him . " The sort who can live with himself afterward ? " She leaned forward and sniffed at him . " The liquor I smell on your breath tells me the answer to my own question . You will drown in it . In the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are now . " Jackson 's grip tightened around her throat . Her words stung him . The truth to them , he supposed . He 'd had a nip even this morning when he first rose . He 'd told himself only to chase the chill from his bones . He told himself a lot of things since his lust for liquor , and for women , had taken over his life . Beneath him , the woman gasped in pain . Her hands closed over his . She pressed his fingers against her throat . " Please , " she whispered . Women had begged for his mercy before , but always because they thrashed in pleasure , never in pain . Jackson tried to force his fingers to squeeze . They would not oblige . It was the babe , he told himself . The witch was right . The child she carried was innocent of the mother 's sins . Jackson eased his hands away from her throat . Through tear-filled eyes , she stared up at him . " Whatever you are , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Will you sit idly by then and watch us suffer for whatever sin you think I have committed against you ? " " No , " he assured her . Jackson moved down between her legs . It was a place not usually unfamiliar to him but a circumstance nearly beyond his comprehension . " Tell me what to do . " Continues ... by Thompson , Ronda
