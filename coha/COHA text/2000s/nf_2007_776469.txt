Lee // Orlando , Florida , January 28 , 2006 // There is a ride at Disney World called the Tower of Terror , and on the weekend of January 28 , 2006 , my four children , even the twin five- year-olds , begged me to go on that ride over and over again . // Housed in a re-created aging Hollywood hotel , the ride begins where you climb into a creaky elevator that snakes its way through the creepy premises . An electrical storm kicks up , and right on cue something goes wrong with the power . The elevator in the eerie hotel suddenly drops . The descent is so rapid , so sudden , that it almost sucks your diaphragm up into your throat , and right before the drop there is a moment where you are literally suspended in air , too stunned to scream . It feels as if speed , motion , light , and time literally freeze . // We must have taken that ride a half dozen times . And then the feeling returned the following morning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before , the kids and I had been to the Animal Kingdom in Disney World . We ? d marveled at the African safari ride , ridden rapids in Asia , and gotten soaked as we howled our way down the man-made white water . After an early dinner we ? d rented a pedal bike with another family and laughed until we cried as we raced other bikers around the lake , while fireworks from Epcot exploded overhead . // Tucking four kids into bed that night , I silently congratulated myself on a good weekend . I ? d come to Disney to shoot a pilot TV show for Family Fun . We ? d spent two days on set and then the rest of the time had been the kids ? reward : combing the parks for Disney character autographs for the twins and thrill-seeking rides for the older two . We ? d planned to fly back home on Sunday and get ready for school . // Toting around four children by myself was not new . That weekend my husband , Bob Woodruff , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was thousands of miles away in Iraq . We spoke to him briefly that day , in between the safari and the rapids ride . He and his crew had had a tiring day covering the Palestinian elections before flying on to Baghdad in advance of President Bush ? s State of the Union address . The plan was to bolster ABC ? s Iraq coverage at an important moment in the war . The pace was blistering , common to any foreign correspondent who must keep moving and file stories from faraway places in time zones eight to twelve hours ahead of our own . // Bob and his crew were operating on an aggressive schedule with only a few hours ? sleep each night . As usual , the itinerary was punishing . Get in , get the stories about the Iraqi military , anchor from Baghdad during Bush ? s address , do some pieces for Good Morning America , and , on the way back , try to finalize an interview with the King of Jordan in Amman , the Jordanian capital . // Our conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cell service in Iraq was spotty and the time difference was frustrating . We had one conversation midday Saturday , as he and his crew were going to bed in a military compound somewhere in Baghdad . He exhaustedly mumbled something about getting much-needed sleep the next day . Exactly what he said didn ? t register with me at the time . My daughter Cathryn was determined to buy a puka shell necklace . With my shoulder cradling the cell phone , I negotiated some cash from my wallet while keeping an eye on the twins , who were dangerously close to a fence in front of a bamboo grove . // Later , Bob would swear that he told me has was going to embed with the military for some exercises , while I would swear he said only that his team was going to relax for the day . At the end of our conversation I passed the cell phone around so the kids could say hi . This was common practice in our house  --  good nights , kisses , homework help , all via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the phone becomes a primary communication tool , for better or worse . // " Do you feel safe there ? " I asked absentmindedly , collecting the change from Cathryn . " Are you okay ? " It was a stupid rhetorical question , made more absurd by the fact that we were currently standing in Disney World , " the happiest place on earth , " while he was somewhere in the most violent place on the planet . // " I do . We ? re surrounded by the military . It ? s fine , " he reassured me . He and his cameraman , Doug Vogt , couldn ? t know that the elevator was about to drop . In the ocher-colored sands on a godforsaken highway outside Baghdad , they were about to enter their own Tower of Terror . // That night I called the front desk to request a 7 a.m. wake-up call . With the bigger kids sleeping next to the twins , perhaps I could slip downstairs the next morning and take a quick swim in the pool before breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was invigorating and it would be a great way to start our last day in Orlando . // In a few days Bob would be home and we ? d be a family again . His new appointment as co-anchor had set a grueling pace for the past month , even the weekends . His days had been crammed with photo shoots , press conferences , and ad campaigns . The new program with Bob and Elizabeth Vargas was committed to go to the story , to have one anchor on the road and one in the studio as often as possible . Bob relished the challenge . It was a new era at ABC News . There was an excitement at the broadcast that was a welcome tonic after the months of sorrow following Peter Jennings ? s illness and then death from lung cancer . Bob and Elizabeth would give the news department something to rally around , after feeling like a ship without its beloved captain . // " Just get through January , " I had told Bob , as he left for the Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mantra for us after the announcement , as he shot out of the gate as a newly minted co-anchor. // " I really don ? t want to leave you guys , " he said , as he leaned into the door frame of my home office , rolling suitcase in hand . He looked exhausted , distracted , and not eager to get back on a plane to return to Iraq for the sixth or seventh time in three years . The town car was already idling in the driveway . // " Just get through January , " I repeated , " and life will take on a more normal pattern . We ? ll have weekends again , and we can be a family . " // He reeled off everything he ? d packed , hoping I ? d figure out what he might have missed . This was familiar territory , this nonchalant leaving . It should have had more weight , but to give it any more importance would have jinxed it in my mind . Pakistan , Afghanistan , Iraq , the Gaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it like a normal morning , and he will come home safe and sound . I had a work deadline that day , and the sooner I got him on the road the faster I could finish my task . // Frankly , I didn ? t think a lot about Bob over the Disney weekend either . The days had been full and the kids eager to pack in as much as possible . Bob drew sustenance from being on the road ; the stories , the energy , the adrenaline rejuvenated him . He loved being a journalist , and that meant leaving us for stretches of time . We may not have always liked it , but we had made peace with it as a family . Periods of being intensely together were interlaced with periods of being apart . // As I rolled over and turned off the bedside light that Saturday night in Disney World , I thought we would all rise to this new challenge of Bob ? s career as well . " Co-anchor . " It was good and bad . Good because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plum job in television news , a successor to one of broadcast journalism ? s icons . Bad because we would see him even less . Our definition of family time would need some revising. // The Sunday morning phone call pierced the quiet and I jolted awake to a bedspread of floral and chintz in a totally unfamiliar room . It took me a second to register where I was . Ah , right , I thought . Disney World . The wake-up call . // I rolled over and picked up the receiver . " Thank you , " I said , and lazily began to set it back on the cradle . I had decided to lie there for a few more minutes before I snuck out the door . // " Lee ? " A faint voice came from the receiver , now almost back in place . Geesh , I thought . Personalized wake-up calls , how very Disney . I brought the phone back to my ear to thank the man . // " Lee , it ? s David Westin , " the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain fired signals to my body as I bolted up on the pillows . The president of ABC News does not make social calls to employees ? wives at 7 a.m. on a Sunday morning , even a co-anchor ? s wife . I licked my lips and swallowed . My mouth was dry . // " We ? ve been trying to reach you , " he said , in a slow measured voice . He stopped for a beat as if to gauge how he would say his next line . " Bob has been wounded in Iraq . " // I sat straight up , trying to process the information I was hearing . Every synapse in my brain was firing . " Wounded ? " I said to David Westin , as calmly as I could . " What do you mean wounded ? " // " He was on an embed outside of Baghdad riding with the Iraqi army . We don ? t have a lot of information right now , Lee , but we are getting it as fast as we can . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David . " I interrupted him . " Is my husband alive ? " // " Yes , Lee . Bob is alive , but we believe he may have taken shrapnel to the brain . " // I tried to digest what that meant and couldn ? t comprehend it . He was alive ; I ? d start with that . The rest was gravy . // " What was an anchor doing on a military exercise ? " I asked , voice rising . " The last thing I knew he was doing a story about an ice cream shop in Baghdad . I thought they were sleeping ! " My mind grasped for facts , searching for what I knew or thought I knew . I was back in the Tower of Terror . // You can ? t know how you would behave in a crisis until it drops out of the sky and knocks you down like a bandit : stealing your future , robbing you of your dreams , and mocking anything that resembles certainty . Sudden tragic events and even slow-burning disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . // I felt the panic in my voice as I spoke to David Westin , and slow tears streamed down my face . At the same time , I began to feel a cool steely calm seep into my brain . It slowly formed a cocoon in which I could think and react rationally , disembodied from my emotions . In the months to come , this cocoon would allow me to handle the very public nature of this crisis , synthesize information , deal with teams of doctors , communicate with family , and take care of the business at hand without collapsing into a mass of spineless marrow . // For now , that steely calm began to morph into the part of me that became " the General . " The General would make important decisions , hold things together for the troops , lead the charge , and  --  most important for our team  --  ensure we didn ? t lose a single man on the battlefield . The General was beginning to take over . // " Lee , we have a plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " David said . " You just have to tell us what time . It ? s fueled up and ready to go . " // I felt I needed to keep him on the line for some reason . I wasn ? t ready to start making decisions . I didn ? t want to take my first step into this new world . I wanted to relish my old life for just a minute more . All four of my children were blissfully sound asleep beyond my door . Inside my room their secure little lives were being hacked apart while they dreamed , oblivious to the chaos . // " Okay , " I said in a small voice . " Tell me what you know . Please tell me what happened . " // " Bob and the crew were traveling on a road in Taji on a routine ride , " David said . " Bob was in an Iraqi armored vehicle . We believe he was doing a stand-up at the time , and they were hit by an IED improvised explosive device in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , but neither man was hit . Bob and the cameraman , Doug Vogt , have been taken by helicopter to Baghdad and are going into surgery . // " Apparently he asked Vinnie , his producer , if he was alive ; he did come to . " David spoke coolly and rationally , but he was clearly rattled . // So he spoke , I thought . He spoke . This is going to be okay . The General in my brain dictated that nothing less than recovery would be acceptable . There were no other options . Bob would be okay . He was always okay . He was lucky and bright and hardworking and a good man . Things like this didn ? t happen to good people . I could feel hope in my heart , on its simplest level , as clear and bright as the streak of a shooting star . Hope is the most basic human emotion . It was the hope that wives have had since the days of the caveman , when they sent their mates out past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a brain-stem reaction . The General in my brain moved hope into the front lines , preparing for the next maneuver. // " Lee , " David gently reminded me , " there are security people on the ground to escort you out of there . The plane is standing by ; you just need to tell us what you want to do . Let us know what time you want to go . When you get home , we are working on getting you to Germany , where Bob will be transported . " // For one moment the silliest thought flashed through my mind . I thought about how much my kids had wanted to ride the Soarin ? attraction and see the rest of Epcot . The part of my brain that was still in shock weighed the option of not ruining their perfectly planned morning for about a tenth of a second before I clicked into action . // " David , let me process this , " I said . " I have to call Bob ? s folks and my family , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I need to think . Let me just get outside of this hotel room so I can talk , and then I ? ll call you back as soon as possible . " //
