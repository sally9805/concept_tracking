Section : OUTDOORS HOME DEFENSE Tactical flashlights give civilians SWAT-team candlepower . <p> If it were a nightmare , you could wake up and it would be over . But this is worse . It 's real and it 's just beginning . That noise that startled you from a sound sleep can mean only one thing . There 's an intruder in your home . If you 're smart , you have a plan for this kind of situation , like picking up the cellphone by your bed and calling the coppers . They 're trained to handle this sort of thing . <p> Even so , with your family 's well-being at stake , you feel an urgency to act - now . You reach for your trusty 12-ga. shotgun or .35 ? Magnum . But , there 's another piece of defensive gear that 's just as important - a tactical flashlight . Developed initially for special forces in the military and law enforcement , these lights , with their intensely bright beams , are also available to civilians . They offer protection by temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional flashlight , which shows the bad guys where you are , tactical lights are designed to identify a target without turning you into one . <p> Tactical lights are designed specifically to be used either alongside a weapon ( a handheld ) or mounted on a long gun or handgun ( a weapon light ) . There 's little point in blinding an intruder to gain a momentary advantage if you ca n't follow up and get the drop on him . Bluffing is a dangerous game . <p> Handheld lights are compact , lightweight , and typically use a momentary switch in the tailcap . You grip the light as you would a hypodermic syringe , with your thumb on the switch . This grip helps you to interlock your hands to brace and aim your handgun , something you ca n't do with a larger flashlight . The momentary switch allows you to sweep a room with short , powerful bursts of light - a technique that makes it difficult for a bad guy to pick out your position . <p> Weapon lights , which usually can double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rail mount that either comes as part of the gun package , or can be purchased separately . Remote switches on long-gun models let you activate the light while maintaining your grip on the gun . <p> Compared to conventional flashlights , tactical lights deliver more light from a more compact , lighter package . A conventional flashlight with two D batteries and a standard bulb puts out about 15 to 20 lumens . A tactical light cranks out a minimum of 60 lumens of solid beam with no holes or dark spots . It also can stand up to the shock and recoil of a firearm . <p> Tactical lights get their blinding ability from a high-pressure xenon-filled bulb with a tungsten filament . Power comes from a pair of 3-volt AA lithium batteries instead of conventional 1.5-volt cells . These batteries typically will give about an hour of continuous run time , and bulbs typically last 25 hours . The 6 volts of juice bums the filament hotter and whiter than that in a conventional flashlight . Precision tolerances between the bulb and reflector , and refractive coatings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform beam of light . Tactical lights come in an assortment of models and features . Here 's a look at the newest lights from the major manufacturers . <p> Streamlight makes handheld lights , and they also market weapon lights made by Insight Technology . Streamlight 's Night-Fighter-2 puts out 100 lumens and features a tough machined aircraft-aluminum body . It has an anodized finish and a polymer grip ring that 's infinitely adjustable for maximum comfort . The small , lightweight design gives you fast target acquisition . The cost is under $75 . <p> Insight Technology specializes in weapon lights and is the foremost supplier of tactical lights and lasers for U.S. special operations . Polymer bodies keep the lights lightweight . The models in the company 's new X ( for " extreme " ) line are ruggedized and water-resistant to 66 ft. , and they incorporate a bulb-shock-suppressant system . To help the filament survive the impact of weapon recoil , a spring is installed in front of the bulb . There 's also a rubber cushion at the rear and a rubber collar encircling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tight tolerances between the bulb assembly and body create an air chamber that provides an additional damping effect . A toggle switch at the rear of the light gives you a choice of a momentary or constant beam . Insight 's M3X Tactical Illuminator costs $220 ( pistol ) and $250 ( long gun ) . It pumps out a peak 125 lumens , can be adjusted from spot to flood , and it takes only 2 seconds to mount or remove the light from the gun . The M6X ( $450 , estimated ) , the newest unit from Insight , also pierces the darkness with a 125-lumen incandescent beam , but this unit adds a visible laser to the package . The laser can be adjusted coaxial to the bore for windage and elevation . The M6X 's miniaturized components take adjuster design technology to the next level . <p> The most advanced tactical light is Insight 's Laser Aiming Module ( L.A.M. ) . Developed in conjunction with firearms maker Heckler &; Koch as a high-end military special ops light , the L.A.M. combines a 60-lumen white light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible and an IR laser - all in a 5-ounce package . This powerhouse of technology does n't come cheap . The L.A.M. , available only to law enforcement agencies , carries a $2250 price tag . A civilian version of the L.A.M. ( $1395 ) gives you the cool special ops look and all the same features except the IR functions . The L.A.M. maintains a very high laser boresight retention of in. at 25 meters . <p> SureFire 's line of new tactical handhelds includes the Z2 CombatLight - the same unit that 's issued to FBI agents and U.S. air marshals . The Z2 ( $86 ) produces 65 lumens for 60 minutes , or 120 lumens for 20 minutes with an optional lamp assembly . The anodized-aluminum body is designed to be held in a syringe grip with a firearm . The Executive Elite E2e is the most compact 2-cell tactical light in the SureFire lineup . You get 60 lumens for 75 minutes from the 4.6-in. , 3.2-ounce anodized-aluminum body package . The light sells for $95 . <p> The L4 Digital Lumamax at $160 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 5-watt Luxeon LED uses digital current regulation . A microprocessor matches the LED 's requirements to the batteries ' output for an optimum level of performance . <p> SureFire 's most technically advanced light is the A2 Aviator Digital Plus . This is the first handheld with an on-board microprocessor for digital current regulation , a high-beam incandescent and three LEDs in a single reflector . The microprocessor also provides a " soft start " instead of the usual voltage spike to the incandescent bulb , for longer filament life . Maximum output is 54 lumens for 50 minutes - just shy of minimum tactical specs , but still highly effective . The LEDs provide usable low-level light for 20 hours . <p> Tactical lights are rapidly gaining in popularity among civilian users , and increasing numbers of handguns have light-mounting hardware that is provided by the maker . While these lights cost substantially more than the flashlight on your bedroom night table , the family protection they offer can be priceless . <p> " The most advanced tactical light is Insight 's Laser Aiming Module .
