Headnote Make your cycling life run as smoothly as a freshly lubed chain . WHEN I STARTED CYCLING FIVE YEARS AGO , after nearly a decade as a competitive runner , there were a lot of things I immediately loved about the sport : drafting , the camaraderie oft he pack , coasting downhill , the ability to slam Krispy K renies and then exercise without puking . There were also a few things that took some getting used to : " easy " rides that lasted two hours , chamois , riding 2 inches oft someone 's wheel , weird rattling noises that seemed to manifest themselves at 35 mph on a switchback-laden downhill . Despite research that suggests fitter people produce lower levels of stress-related chemicals , there were still days when , for whatever reason , the lunch ride would , well , stress me out . Fortunately , with experience and ample advice from the rest of BICYCLING 'S staff- " watch the jersey , not the wheel , " I was told to help boost my confidence drafting in a pack-I 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course in what I 've learned on the road and trail , some of it from actual crashes . Think of it as many years ' worth of tips that could change your life in just a tew minutes . FIND MORE TIME TO RIDE Keep all your cycling gear in the same place , all the time-a bag or backpack works fine if you do n't have shelf space . And when the ride is over , put the stuff back in that place as soon as possible . Less time searching equals more time riding . Or resting . Leave your shoes clipped into your cleats after a ride , or keep an extra pair tucked under the front passenger seat of your car . Wash your cycling clothes separately from the rest of the family laundry so you always know where they are . ( This also spares you the indignity of having a pair of renegade Little Mermaid underpants fall out of your jersey sleeve as you 're suiting up in the parking lot . ) Instead of storing your bottles in a kitchen cabinet after washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cages . Or , refill them and store them in the fridge , ready to grab and go . Clean your hydration-pack bladder as soon as you get home : Empty the old water , refill with water and a lew drops of bleach , shake , rinse well and store in the freezer . No scrubbing or drying required . If you drive to most of your rides , keep a plastic storage bin in your car , stocked with chain lube , sunblock , extra tubes , minitools , a shock pump and rags . And keep a floor pump in your trunk . To take organization to a new , and perhaps unhealthy , level , arrange your closet around cycling , with jerseys , bibs and undershirts on hangers , grouped by fabric and season . BE FEARLESS Endo-proof your off-road descent by getting your weight back behind the saddle . And although it 's smart to keep a couple fingers on the brake levers while riding downhill , on climbs or flat technical sections hold only the grip . This will preserve momentum , which helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of brake if you get nervous . Counting to 10 is a time-honored trick tor taming a hot temper , but it also calms your mind in nerve-racking situations such as sketchy off-road descents or tight packs . Try counting by fives rhythmically next time your nerves are rattling . Commuting improves skills in several ways : You 're often riding at slow speeds , which improves balance . Usually , there is trafficnearby , which forces you to learn to hold your line . You also learn how to look over your shoulder without veering , and how to take a pothole hit . Plus , you get a good feel for braking in all conditions . MAINTENANCE MADE EASY When diagnosing a bike malfunction , start with the smallest , easiest fix first and move up from there . No sense in trying your first-ever hydraulic brake bleed when all you need to do is lube the caliper pistons , When you have to restock items , buy multiples-instead of getting one tube or Cu2 cartridge , get five , or 10-whatever your wallet is comfortable with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be prepared , For easy postride cleanup , keep the following supplies wherever you store your bike : two disposable cotton cloths or T-shirts from last year 's century ( one for the drivetrain , one for the rest of the bike ) , lube and a bottle of rubbing alcohol . Rubbing alcohol is best for rims because it cleans and then evaporates , leaving no residue . If you feel your heart rate creeping up while you 're working on your bike , stop what you 're doing , walk away , and wait a minute or two before resuming the repair . Sometimes this is all it takes to get components to behave themselves . To deal with problems that inevitably crop up the night before a big ride , after shops have closed , keep on hand : brake and derailleur cables ( two of each ) , K ) feet of brake and derailleur housing , a good cable cutter ( we like Felco 's ; felcostore.com ) , housing ferrules , four replacement brake pads , a spare chain and two chain connectors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tube change at home so you know what to expect on the road or trail . Do you need tire levers or not ? Will your minipump really go to 90 psi ? Do you know how to use a CO2 infiator ? ( You 've got one shot to get it right . ) What valve-stem length best fits your deep-section rims ? This is all good stuff to figure out in the comfort of your garage rather than M Siberian Outpost No. 39 . Want to learn a new repair-or train your buddies so they stop hounding you to fix their bikes ? Throw a maintenance potluck . Each guest brings a bike , tools and a snack ; you provide the frosty beverages . BE STRONG IN THE PACK Do n't panic if the first of couple miles of a group ride feel too fast . The excitement of rolling out with the pack can cause your heart rate and breathing to increase before you 're properly warmed up , but your body should settle down within 10 minutes or so . If you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new type of riding-wear your favorite clothes . You 'll be happy , even if you 're stressed . Ride with a slow friend or a newbie once in awhile . Research shows that helping others reduces stress by increasing your selfesteem , and it 's de facto a low-key ride . Riding with a group is fun , but if you 're finding that keeping up with the pack is causing you a lot of mental distress , ride alone . You can set your own pace , rediscover your strengths-and practice the skills that you need for pack rides . RIDE FASTER , FEEL BETTER Instead of messing around with complicated training schedules , just ride one day fast , one day hilly and one day long per week . All your training needs addressed ! Dream big , but while you 're on the road , focus on small improvements-staying with the group a few miles longer each ride , or leading the paceline for a few more pedal strokes . Before you ride , drop a couple slices of lemon into a mostly full bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rag with the lemon water and wipe yourself down . In addition to being nature 's antiseptic , lemon aroma is believed to reduce stress and fatigue . Although it 's tempting to hole up in your basement with the trainer and DVD player when the weather turns foul , ride outside if you can-natural light is a proven mood lifter . Here is the key to the easiest interval workout ever : 20x1 . Ride one minute hard , then one minute easy . Do this 20 times . Aside from driving up your top-end fitness , it has also been shown to rev your EPOC ( excess postexercise oxygen consumption ) , so you burn more calories after you 're finished . And a University of Georgia study suggests that intense exercise is more effective at reducing anxiety than moderate exercise , although both are recommended . THE HANDS-DOWN BEST STRESS BUSTER Many cyclists who commute to work by bike end up with more free time , because they do n't have to squeeze in a workout on top of the time they spend driving . Plus being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in long lines at lights gives you more of a sense of control , which is the opposite of how we feel when we 're stressed . If the idea of commuting the whole way , every day , on a bike sounds daunting , start small . Drive part of the way , or split your commute : drive in , ride home , then ride in and drive home the next day . If your boss gives you a hassle about your two-wheeled time , throw out this stat : Stress-related complaints cost businesses $200 to $300 billion a year . Also , research shows that fitter people are more productive at work ; one study ot real estate brokers found that those in the best shape also earned the best commissions . The ultimate endorsement : Hans Selye ( 1907-1982 ) , considered by many to be the world 's original stress researcher-some say he even coined the term-was a bike commuter . Sidebar When things get scary on road descents , sit up so that wind resistance will help slow you down . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more stable . Store your sunglasses anggloves inside your helmet , and hang your helmet on your handlebar . Do n't worry about telling your right from your left : Pedals go on ip the direction you turn the cranks when you 're riding . Sidebar Head for the hills : It takes less mental energy to boost your heart rate on a climb than it does time-trialing on the flats . Carry your charged cell phone-the 21 st century 's security blanket-on every ride , and make sure you have the digits of several people in your group . Good things to keep in your office : a spare set of riding and work clothes , plus a selection of breakfast and snack foods , such as dried fruit , instant oatmeal , tea bags or energyoars . <p>
