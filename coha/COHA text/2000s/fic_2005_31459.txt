Prologue The man said , " Welcome to Book Beat , Mr. Janeway " and this was how it began . We were sitting in a Boston studio before the entire invisible listening audience of National Public Radio . I was here against my better judgment , and my first words into the microphone , " Just do n't call me an expert on anything , " staked out the conditions under which I had become such an unlikely guest . Saying it now into the microphone had a calming effect , but the man 's polite laugh again left me exposed on both flanks . Not only was I an expert , his laugh implied , I was a modest one . His opening remarks deepened my discomfort . " Tonight we are departing from our usual talk about current books . As many of you know , our guest was to have been Allen Gleason , author of the surprising literary bestseller , Roses for Adessa . Unfortunately , Mr. Gleason suffered a heart attack last week in New York , and I know all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In his absence we are lucky to have Mr. Cliff Janeway , who came to Boston just this week to buy a very special book . And I should add that this is a show , despite its spontaneous scheduling , that I have long wanted to do . As fascinating as the world of new books can often be , the world of older books , of valuable first editions and treasures recently out of print , has a growing charm for many of our listeners . Mr. Janeway , I wonder if you would answer a basic question before we dive deeper into this world . What makes a valuable book valuable ? " This was how it began : with a simple , innocent question and a few quick answers . We talked for a while about things I love best , and the man was so good that we soon seemed like two old bookscouts hunkered down together after a friendly hunt . I talked of supply and demand , of classics and genres and modern first editions : why certain first editions by Edgar Rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how crazy the hunt can get . I told him about the world I now lived in , and it was easy to avoid the world I 'd come from . This was a book show , not a police lineup , and I was an antiquarian bookseller , not a cop . " I understand you live in Denver , Colorado . " " When I 'm hiding out from the law , that 's where I hide . " Again the polite laugh . " You say you 're no expert , but you were featured this week in a very bookish article in The Boston Globe . " " That guy had nothing better to do . He 's a book freak and the paper was having what they call a slow news day . " " The two of you met at a book auction , I believe . Tell us about that . " " I had come here to buy a book . We got to talking and the next thing I knew , I was being interviewed . " " What book did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mecca by Richard Burton . " " The explorer , not the actor . " We shared a knowing laugh , then he said , " What is it about this book that made you fly all the way from Denver to buy it ? And to pay - how much was it ? - if you do n't mind my asking ... " Auction prices were public knowledge , so there was no use being coy . I said , " Twenty-nine thousand five hundred , " and gave up whatever modesty I might have had . Only an expert pays that much money for a book . Or a fool . I might have told him that there were probably dozens of dealers in the United States whose knowledge of Burton ran deeper than mine . I could have said yes , I had studied Burton intensely for two months , but two months in the book trade or in any scholarly pursuit is no time at all . I should have explained that I had bought the book with Indian money , but then I 'd need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been shot talking about me . Instead I talked about Burton , master linguist , soldier , towering figure of nineteenth-century letters and adventure . I watched the clock as I talked and I gave him the shortest-possible version of Burton 's incredible life . I could n't begin to touch even the high spots in the time we had left . " You 've brought this book with you tonight . " We let the audience imagine it as I noisily unwrapped the three volumes in front of the microphone . My host got up from his side of the table and came around to look while I gave the audience a brief description of the books , with emphasis on the original blue cloth binding lettered in brilliant gilt and their unbelievably pristine condition . The man said , " They look almost new . " " Yeah , " I said lovingly . " I understand there 's something special about them , other than their unusual freshness . " I opened volume one and he sighed . " Aaahh , it 's signed by the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " ' To Charles Warren , ' " I read : " ' A grand companion and the best kind of friend . Our worlds are far apart and we may never see each other again , but the time we shared will be treasured forever . Richard F. Burton . ' It 's dated January 15 , 1861 . " " Any idea who this Warren fellow was ? " " Not a clue . He 's not mentioned in any of the Burton biographies . " " You would agree , though , that that 's an unusually intimate inscription . " I did agree , but I was no expert . The man said , " So we have a mystery here as well as a valuable book , " and it all began then . Its roots went back to another time , when Richard Francis Burton met his greatest admirer and then set off on a secret journey , deep into the troubled American South . Because of that trip a friend of mine died . An old woman found peace , a good man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey across the timeless , infinite world of books . ( Continues ... )
