I believe this is the first time in my life I 've had something in common with RuPaul . The cross-dressing superstar and I have both started blogging , which is almost as much fun as it sounds . A blog , short for weblog , is a kind of spontaneous online public journal . Users typically add to a scrolling list of entries a couple of times a day with whatever ramblings come to mind  --  what they had for dinner , how their grandparents are getting along , their 10 favorite songs of the year  --  all sprinkled with links to cool Web pages they have discovered . Blogs are so easy to put together that new ones pop up every day . <P> Sacks of fan mail and nationwide tours certainly give you a lot to talk about , but you do n't have to be RuPaul to succeed in the world of blogs . The best blogs are often those that deal honestly with the trivia of ordinary lives . Think Bridget Jones 's Diary meets reality TV . From Polyester Lester in Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
