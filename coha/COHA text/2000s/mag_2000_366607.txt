GOOD NEWS <P> NICOTINE FIT No one wants to say anything good about nicotine , but the highly addictive chemical may in fact have some benefits . A preliminary study of 100 children with Tourette 's syndrome  --  a bizarre affliction in which patients involuntarily grimace , shout obscenities , even bark  --  finds that those given nicotine patches along with standard medication ( the tranquilizer Haldol ) had fewer symptoms than kids on placebo patches . And though some young users complained of side effects like nausea , none got hooked . <P> ATTENTION ! Using a special MRI technique , researchers have mapped out regions of the brain involved in paying attention . The frontal cortex and parietal cortex  --  in the front and back of the brain , respectively  --  appear to light up when subjects focus on certain signals . Then , as the new stimuli are processed , the visual cortex in the lower rear of the brain moves into action . The finding may help researchers better understand **31;10962;TOOLONG disorder and even schizophrenia . <P> BAD NEWS <P> FORGET ESTROGEN ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alzheimer 's , after all . Doctors had every reason to believe it might be ; studies show it may prevent the brain-deteriorating disease , and several preliminary reports suggested it could actually be used to treat it . But now the largest and longest study on the subject  --  100 women with mild to moderate Alzheimer 's who took estrogen for a year  --  finds that the drug did nothing to improve patients ' memory , attention span or language skills . <P> HEARTBREAK HOTELS Warning : more than 80% of cribs in U.S. hotels may be unsafe . Spot checks revealed a variety of hazards , including cribs with soft bedding or adult-size sheets ( both known suffocation risks ) and cribs with gaps between the mattress and frame that could entrap a baby . Also , about half of mesh-sided cribs checked had holes big enough for infants to get stuck in . What to do ? Call ahead and insist that cribs are in good repair . <P>  --  By Janice M.
