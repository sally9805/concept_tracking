<p> A film with zero commercial prospects  --  a tiny budget , no studio , no stars ( in fact , no professional actors ) , shot entirely on video  --  could become the first champion or the first casualty in the battle over where and when you can watch first-run movies . <p> Bubble , Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh 's ultra-indie about dirty dealings at a Ohio doll factory , will be available for sale on DVD within days of its release in a handful of theaters Jan. 27 , the same day it 's available on TV 's video-on-demand services . <p> " The industry and , more important , consumers , are ready to hear somebody say , ' The way it is now does n't make sense anymore , ' " says Todd Wagner , co-owner of 2929 Productions , which is financing and releasing Bubble . " The ( old ) model is , I do n't want to go so far as say broken , but certainly does n't align with the way people want to consume entertainment today . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offbeat , unusual and non-commercial filmmaking experiments  --  like working with non-actors  --  in front of viewers . " Otherwise , it 's an idea that would n't have seen the light of day , " Soderbergh says . <p> Bubble 's simultaneous release is a practice known in Hollywood as " day-and-date releases , " which means everything comes out on the same date , but it also could be described as a kind of omni-debut . The goal is to put the film on as many screens as possible , including the ones in your home , to capitalize on viewers who prefer to forgo the communal theatergoing experience . <p> Soderbergh plans to make at least six films for release this way . He 's working on The Good German , with George Clooney , which is set for the traditional movie release pattern . But he hopes to start another Bubble-type film next year . " I 'm convinced that five years from now , everything is going to go out like this , " the director says . <p> Omni-debuts would give homebodies the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time it 's making a pop-culture splash , while those seeking a night out can still choose to catch it with an audience on the big screen . <p> This practice is particularly attractive for the makers and distributors of smaller films such as Bubble , which would not necessarily be shown outside of New York and Los Angeles . <p> It 's also an attempt to get ahead of the way consumers are embracing entertainment in new formats , including the computer , iPod and cellphones , while growing impatient with so-called " distribution windows " that create a cascading series of restrictions for a film over a period of years : first to theaters , then hotels and airplanes , then home video , pay cable and finally , broadcast TV . <p> For studios , the benefit would be saving costs gained from marketing all the formats at once , instead of one after the other . <p> " It sometimes costs $50 million to $100 million to market a major film in theaters , then you mount a $10 million or $20 million campaign for DVD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade journal DVD Exclusive . " They could save tens of millions of dollars per movie . " <p> Despite any potential savings , nobody just yet is willing to risk a powerhouse product  --  or even B-movie fare  --  on such an experiment . Many believe providing this flexibility for the consumer represents the future of movies , but right now there is too much unknown about how it would work . <p> Bubble has no connection to any Hollywood mega-corporation , but many will be watching to see whether there 's any knowledge to be gleaned by Bubble 's failure or success , although nobody is predicting blockbuster status in even the best-case scenario . <p> " Of course , you pay attention , You have to pay attention , " says Tom Sherak , a partner in Revolution Studios , which recently released Rent , The Fog and the upcoming Freedomland . " I 'm not quite sure it 's a good thing for the business as we know it , but the business changes every 20 seconds now . " <p> Soderbergh , whose goal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is also curious how his business partners will quantify success . " I 've got to talk with them about how we judge for ourselves the relative success or lack of success of the experiment , " he says . " I want to know if it does n't go as well as we hope , what do we do on the next one ? " <p> The main questions are : Does the popularity of one format take away from the audience for the other ? Or does the option of home viewing lure in people who would n't have gone to the theater anyway , thus creating new customers instead of cannibalizing the theater crowd ? <p> " We know it 's not going to be a barnburner , but studios will say ' It should have done X amount of units on DVD , ' and we 'll see if it does and draw some conclusions , " DVD Exclusive 's Hettrick says . <p> Theaters feel threatened <p> Major theater owners hate the idea . <p> Many say it ultimately only will cost them customers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has 3,500 screens , believes " a film released on DVD the same day and date would n't play well in a theatrical environment , just as a made-for-TV movie would n't play well either , " says spokeswoman Melanie Bell . <p> Kendrick Macdowell , general counsel for the National Association of Theatre Owners , says the only member company he knew that supported omni-debuts was the Landmark chain , which is owned by 2929 Productions ' Wagner . The practice will ultimately be bad for studios and theaters alike , Macdowell says . <p> Some people see a movie multiple times in theaters , then buy it on DVD and watch it later on cable or broadcast TV . <p> The Bubble model could dampen that enthusiasm for major movies . <p> " I think they 're making a big mistake in assuming a simultaneous release should be the model for the entire industry , " Macdowell says . <p> Some theaters have the policy that if it 's available elsewhere , they will not show it . <p> " We do n't like it , " says Terrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,357 screens . " If it 's out on DVD , we would n't show in any of our first-run theaters . " <p> That attitude puts fear in major Hollywood studios , which need to keep exhibitors happy , or they wo n't get the thousands of screens necessary to remain competitive in the blockbuster market . <p> So how does Bubble get any screens at all ? <p> Wagner and partner Mark Cuban , the owner of the Dallas Mavericks , made billions in the Internet boom and have invested in movies with the Landmark Theatres chain and HDNet Movies , the video-on-demand cable service . They plan to release Bubble through these two outlets on Jan. 27 , along with DVD sales in various unspecified retail stores on Jan. 31 . Wagner also says some of the theaters will be outside art houses . <p> But he ca n't specify many other details at this point : How many DVDs will be produced for sale ? What will they cost ? ( He does says DVDs will be sold at " a premium , " meaning more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiment wo n't kill theaters , and part of 2929 's business plan is to offer a small percentage of DVD sales to theaters that show the film as a goodwill gesture for any lost patronage . <p> Mostly , the DVD and video-on-demand elements are aimed not at the youth who frequent most multiplexes , but on folks who already have given up on theaters , Wagner says . <p> " There is pent-up demand from people in their 30s , 40s and 50s who are not going to go to the movie theater , anyway . Those folks are n't going no matter how many TV commercials you pay for , " he says . <p> Will others follow ? <p> Few studios have taken up the omni-debut charge . One exception has been the Walt Disney Co . <p> Last August , about a month before he formally assumed his new role as head of Disney , CEO Robert Iger told investors in a teleconference : " I do n't think it 's out of the question that a DVD can be released in effect in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we will get a fair amount of push-back on this from the industry , it 's not out of the question . " <p> Disney refused comment for this story . <p> Iger made TV shows such as Lost and Desperate Housewives available for downloading off Apple 's iTunes Internet service the day after they air on ABC , which also could be done with movies , although there is no indication that is part of his plan . <p> Last month , Iger told The Wall Street Journal he had wanted to sell DVDs of the animated Disney comedy Chicken Little in the lobby of theaters showing the picture . " So you 've seen the movie and just as when you go to a play on Broadway or a concert , you can buy the DVD . That 's when people are feeling best about it , and you cut the theater owner in to the video sale , " he said . <p> Iger acknowledged that theaters balked , but other companies besides Disney are exploring ways to close the window : <p> *20th Century Fox is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exclusive reported Monday that Peter Chernin , chief operating officer of parent company News Corp. , plans to make movies available for one-time viewing in an unspecified high-definition format 60 days after the theatrical debut . Chernin , who made the remarks at a speech in Las Vegas at the Consumer Electronics Show , did not provide specifics . <p> *On Friday , Google announced plans for its Google Video Store service . The service will provide users with the option to buy and download videos , amateur films , NBA games and some classic TV shows through CBS . In an innovative approach , Google says whoever uploads a film can set the price for those who want to download it . <p> *Rainbow Media later this year plans to release three films through a video-on-demand service it is pitching to cable companies at the same time it releases them on the big screen at the IFC Center in New York . <p> Among the films Rainbow has acquired for the project : American Gun , a drama with Marcia Gay Harden ; Sorry , Haters , a thriller starring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jailed Muslim ; and CSA : The Confederate States of America , a faux-documentary from producer Spike Lee about contemporary America if the South won the Civil War . <p> Rainbow Media president Joshua Sapan says he 's aiming mainly at independent-movie fans who live outside urban centers and do n't have local theaters that show the films they want . <p> " People will read a review in The New York Times and what will then happen is , you 're living in Des Moines , Iowa , or Madison , Wis. , and you ca n't see it , " he says . With his plan , " you 'll be able to go home and turn on your television and stay absolutely current in the world of indie film . " <p> Meanwhile , the first one to race onto the battlefield is Bubble . <p> " This is not Spider-Man 3 , but it 's the start of a process , " Wagner says . <p> PHOTO , Color , Magnolia Pictures PHOTO , B/W , Magnolia Pictures PHOTO , B/W , Trey Batchelor , Magnolia Pictures
