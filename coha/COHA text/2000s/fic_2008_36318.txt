Nothing with Strings <p> Louise and her sister , Lily , were standing in the middle of the parking lot of a Super Wal-Mart in Despera Springs , Florida , trying to decide where to sprinkle their mother 's ashes . They had driven for hours across the Panhandle to get here , with the ashes in a gold-toned plastic urn on the backseat , but now nothing seemed right . They kept remembering the stories their mother had told them all their lives of her Despera Springs childhood : the monkey who died in a watermelon rind ; the mysterious stranger who walked around behind a blue mule and was never seen again ; the brave boy who swam across the lake in the path of light from the tower of the Chautauqua building . In a lifetime of retellings , certain phrases had settled into place like keystones : " curled up in a watermelon rind , " " never seen again , " and " the path of light "  --  and the stories developed a lilt and cadence that made Despera Springs seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find on a map and drive to on an interstate highway . <p> But here they were , and as far as the eye could see , there was nothing but discount stores , gas stations , used-car lots , and fast-food restaurants . <p> " We ca n't sprinkle her ashes here , " said Louise . " She 'd end up stuck on somebody 's shoes and tracked into a nail and tan salon . " <p> Lily was no help . She had just had her heart broken by a banjo player , and all she wanted to do was listen to the Stanley Brothers singing heartache songs and weep . <p> " Let 's go , " said Louise . " Just drive around , maybe we 'll find a vacant lot , sprinkle her in some weeds , and get on home . " <p> " Oh , your poison love has stained the lifeblood in my heart and soul , and I know my life will never be the same , " Ralph Stanley sang from the tape player in a high , keening wail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears welled up and she backed smack into the side of a dented-in , scraped-up , painted-over Plymouth Reliant . In a terrible silence they craned their necks and watched the car door creak open and a long leg reach out , agile toes clutching on to blue shower shoes , then the whole man unfolding out of the driver 's seat , tall , loose , and lanky . <p> " We are so sorry , sir , " Louise said all in a dither , scrambling out to meet him . " My sister should not be driving a car . She just had her heart broken by a banjo player , and the tears distort her depth perception . " <p> The man stopped and staggered back on his heels . He peered in earnestly at Lily . " Bluegrass ? " he said . " Or old-time ? " <p> " Old-time , " said Lily . <p> " Aw , honey , bless your heart . " He squatted down and gazed at her sorrowfully . <p> " Wait a minute , " said Louise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Should n't we be examining our cars and assessing the damage ? " <p> " We are assessing the damage , " said the man , and he stood up , took two spoons out of his pocket , and went into a little shuffling dance , tapping the spoons high up on his thigh , chucka chucka chucka , then down near his knee , hitting the palm of his hand on the upstroke , double time , ticka ticka ticka . <p> " I ca n't find any dents on your car that are n't already rusted over , " called Louise . <p> With a little flourish he drew the spoons slowly across the inside of his knuckles and slipped them back into his pocket . <p> " You can trust me , " he said to Lily . " I do n't play nothing with strings on it . " <p> " Can you help us find something ? " said Louise . " We 're looking for a lake somewhere around here , where there used to be a building with a tower . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a man might disappear behind a blue mule , or a brave boy might swim in a path of light , " said Lily , " to sprinkle our mother 's ashes . " <p> " I know what you want , " said the spoon player . " Come on . " And he shuffled back to his car , the soles of his shower shoes slapping against his heels . Louise punched Ralph Stanley out of the tape player , and Lily drove carefully , with her eyes wide and both hands on the wheel . They followed him out of the parking lot , out onto Highway 90 , past a cineplex and an industrial park . His back bumper was crumpled up and hiked up too high on one side , which gave a goofy look to the car , like a dog with one ear wrong-side out . They turned right at a light , then left at a stop sign . They passed a gun and pawn shop and an abandoned scrapyard in a pecan grove . They crossed a railroad track , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row of dried-up-looking , old , spindly houses , long ago painted white . <p> " What are we doing ? " said Louise . " Is this safe ? " <p> " Stay on the risers , " he said , and they followed him up rotten steps , across a toppling side porch , and out onto the front . There was a little , weedy yard , a crumbling street , then a long slope to a perfectly round lake , shining black in the afternoon sun . Across the lake in the hazy distance they could see an old building with a sagging roof and a crooked octagonal tower . <p> " Look , Louise , " said Lily . " Go get the ashes , it 's Despera Springs ! " <p> It was the kind of sight , with the dwindling season , the dappling and the shimmering and the haze , that brings simpleminded emotions to the surface , and Louise stood at the porch railing and thought about their mother , on just such a fall day as this , a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her final rest ; and Lily , with the selfishness of the brokenhearted , thought about her lost love , the banjo player , and how she would never be able to stand and look at such a sight with him . <p> They were both lost in these easy reveries , blinking back cheap tears , when they heard an odd ruffling sound behind them and turned around to see through the screen door an old woman sitting in a straight chair holding an ax in both hands and staring into the fireplace at a big black-and-white Muscovy duck , up to his little gnarly knees in soot and ashes . <p> " Grab him ! " she called out . " Do n't let him flap , he 'll fling soot all over the house ! " The spoon player grabbed the duck with both hands , backed out with him through the screen door , stretched his neck over the porch post , and one two three whack , the old woman chopped his head off and he flopped down into the azalea bushes . <p> Louise sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake with her hands limp in her lap ; Lily wheeled around and stared wide-eyed into the gloom of the cluttered room ; and the old woman sat down heavily on the top step and grabbed Louise by the knee . <p> " I am exhausted , " the old woman said . " I have congestive heart failure , and any little thing like that will wear me slap out . " <p> It took them different ways . Louise , feeling a maniacal need to establish some kind of order , fell into a patter of formal good manners , introducing herself and giving a brief nonsensical synopsis of their mission here : their long drive , no place for the ashes , the spoon player , the Chautauqua building  --  " and this is my younger sister , Lily . " <p> But Lily would n't stop staring into the house . For some reason , with that whack and flop she had felt the banjo player lifted out of her mind for the first time in months , and images of the cluttered room rushed in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crumpled chandelier slouched in a corner like a giant spider , a clothes rack draped with white cotton underwear . <p> The spoon player finally brought them back to their senses , bouncing around the corner of the house with the duck , picked , drawn , and singed . He rinsed it at the spigot , laid it out in a black skillet , and set it down on the porch beside the old woman , who picked out one last pinfeather . <p> " They come up from the lake and fly down the chimney , " she said to Louise , " and we eat them . " <p> " Oh , " gasped Louise . " That makes sense . " And she and the old woman settled down quite companionably on the steps with the duck in its skillet and the ashes in their gold-toned urn between them , getting everything straight  --  " So you are Lila Martin 's girls ; I had a cousin who married a Martin , " the old woman said , and " That was Sid Stringer 's monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " Yes , that 's the spoon player , he keeps a lightbulb screwed in over at the Chautauqua tower , looks after us somewhat . " <p> Behind them Lily sat on the porch floor , playing with the reflection of the Chautauqua building in her mind . When the breeze died down and the reflection in the lake grew clear and distinct , she could squint her eyes and make herself believe that the reflection was the building itself . This seemed to make anything possible , and she went on to imagine ladies in white lawn and gentlemen in bowler hats strolling in the lake yard , a drunken monkey on a red leash , a blue mule , and a mysterious stranger with a black mustache . Then a little breeze would stir up the ripples , the reflection would slur , and everything would shift back to real . Her mind would clamp down again , and there would be the banjo player on that cold , cold night , nudging her down the walkway and saying , " How could you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the spoon player , looking at her through the spindles . " It 's not your fault . You just let love get tangled up in your mind with a stringed instrument , that 's all , easiest mistake in the world . " <p> Lily smiled at him , the patient , weary smile of the brokenhearted . " You 're sweet , " she said . <p> " I can help you . " He wiped his hands on his pants and slid the spoons out of his pocket . " I can teach you to play the spoons . " He drew them slowly across his cupped palm with a little muffled cluck . " Hell , I can make you wish you were a spoon . " <p> " Let 's cook this duck , " said the old lady , standing up and tweaking the seat of her skirt straight . " You bring him in , " she said to Louise , " I 'm not that strong . " <p> " The thing is about spoons is , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " <p> There was a clatter of pots and pans , rattling and crashing from the kitchen , and a big , sleek rat dashed through the screen door and hurtled off the edge of the porch . <p> " Sinking ship , " said Lily . <p> The spoon player closed his eyes , screwed up his face , and started singing " Pretty Polly , " then came in on the spoons , chucka chucka chucka . From the kitchen they heard steady talking , then a frying sound . " I was digging on your grave the best part of last night , " sang the spoon player . They smelled cooking onions , garlic , and pepper . <p> " She 's browning it , " said Lily . " My sister can cook anything . " <p> " Look here , " he said , " you take the spoons back-toback , you put this finger between here , that gives you your distance . " <p> " But I do n't want to learn to play the spoons . I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily said . <p> In the kitchen the clatter settled down and the long , slow cooking began . Louise and the old woman strolled out into the side yard where the early camellias had started to bloom . The spoon player leaned up against the porch post and dozed off with his arms flopped over his bony knees . Lily wandered around the edge of the lake where the ducks were beginning to settle down for the night , standing on first one foot , then the other , tucking their heads under their wings . There was that good pond smell , and the smell of old towns in the fall of the year  --  piled-up leaves , dry rot , sasanquas , the last of the ginger lilies and the first of the tea olive . Then there was something else  --  the deep , rich smell of roasting duck . <p> " There 's just enough , " said Louise , ladling out dark gravy . Somehow she and the old woman had rummaged out of all that clutter an elegant table setting for four  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willow plates , thin water glasses with chipped gold rims , and in the middle a bowl of sasanquas , pink and ruffly . The whole thing was just beautiful , all blue and white and rosy , and they stood and looked at it for a minute , that peaceful gleaming place smoothed out of all this mess . Then the spoon player said , " I can tell we 're gon ' eat , " and they did . <p> It was way past dark by the time they had sopped up the last little driblets of gravy , washed the dishes , and flung the duck bones out into the bushes . " Y'all are welcome to spend the night , " said the old woman . Then she trailed off down a dark passage , mumbling something about clean sheets . <p> But there 's nothing like cooking and eating the native food of a place to make you feel as if you belong there , and Louise wanted to explore this old town where she now felt so at home . " Let 's go walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashlight , sir , you can tell us the stories . " <p> There were no streetlights in this left-behind town , and from the edge of the lake they could barely see the houses straggling along the street like the old , dried-up shed skin of a snake . But across the lake one light was shining out of the broken-out windows in the tower of the Chautauqua building . <p> " Look , Louise , " said Lily . " The path of light ! " And sure enough , there it was like a wrinkled yellow ribbon stretched out across the black water . <p> " Well , I 'll be , " said Louise . " Just like in the story . " <p> The spoon player stepped out and turned to look at Lily . " You could swim across that . " <p> " That 's just what I 'm fixing to do , " said Lily , and she took off her shoes and stepped out of her skirt . <p> " Lily ! " said Louise , grabbing her by both arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " But Lily was already up to her ankles in mud , little pools of water forming around her feet . <p> " Ai n't nothing out there 'll eat her , " said the spoon player , holding the flashlight up to his forehead and playing the light across the water . " I do n't see no red eyes . " <p> " Lily ! " said Louise . " You 'll drown ! Your belly is full of duck ! " But Lily was up to her knees , throwing off her shirt . <p> " That duck will give her strength , " said the spoon player . <p> " Lily ! " said Louise . " I 'm sure this is against the law ! " <p> " The law ai n't looking , " said the spoon player . <p> It felt terrifyingly spooky at first , with the rough grass scratching her legs in the dark and the mud squishing up around her feet . But when she got deep enough to stretch out and swim , she thought nothing had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . At first she swam elegantly , as she had been taught , with long , smooth strokes , lifting her head to the side to breathe . But when she finally stopped to look around , she saw that she had lost the light and was yawing off into the darkness . She treaded water for a minute , twirling around in a panic looking for the light . She could n't tell whether it was exhaustion or terror making her breathe so hard , deep , gasping gulps and whimpering exhalations , so she just floated for a while to calm down , with her back to the darkness and her face to the starry sky . Then she turned over and began to swim again , dog-paddling with her head up this time , staring straight ahead at the light . How simple it was , she thought , for just this little while  --  nothing in the world but black water and deep blue sky , and these silly little movements of her hands and feet keeping her alive . Then it seemed as if all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closer , then she was in the fringe of grass again , and there was Louise throwing Lily 's shirt over her shoulders and saying , " I have never heard of anything so foolish ! " and " Lily , what in the world , " and there was the spoon player smiling his gap-toothed smile and saying , " I knew you 'd come out of it , " and they walked back around the street with Lily 's teeth chattering the whole way . <p> They never found the clean sheets , but Louise cleared a space on a sofa in the front room and they fell asleep with their feet propped up on a box fan and their heads on a twelve-pack of toilet paper , Louise still scolding softly , " Why on earth ... , " and Lily with her hair still dripping , feeling clean and strong , as if with all that gasping and gulping she had finally breathed out something poison that had settled in deep . <p> It was bright daylight when they woke up . The spoon player had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rattling around in the kitchen , frying eggs . Lily went out on the porch and looked down at the lake , glittering in the morning sun . Its dark comforts of the night before were gone , and now it looked like something brittle that had shattered into little sparkling chips . <p> " Look , " said Louise , " we forgot all about Mama 's ashes . " There was the plastic urn still sitting on the top step , with dew beaded up on the gold . They took it down to the edge of the lake , Louise prized off the lid , and without any ceremony she flung the ashes out over the water . A few ducks waddled over , stomped around for a while , then dabbled and rooted around in the mud and shallow water , smacking their bills together , chucka chucka chucka  --  for all the world , thought Lily , like a pair of spoons.Copyright 2008 by Bailey White <br> Library of Congress subject headings for this publication : <br> Holidays  --  Fiction . <br> Southern States  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
