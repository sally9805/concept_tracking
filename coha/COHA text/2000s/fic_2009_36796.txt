She kept her eyes on the birches that had comforted her when she moved to this isolated house three years ago . She had leaned against them and pretended she was back in Latvia ; they had watched over her even on moonless nights . They were leafless now , and their white trunks glimmered through darkness like ghosts . Their slender branches reproached her . Why are you still here ? they whispered as they moved in the wind . <p> His gaze was on a poster of powerboats out on the lake , but the lower parts of their bodies were fused , like those of Siamese twins , two women Anna had seen when she was seven , in a carnival tent near Berlin . They had three breasts and one set of enormous hips between them . A hand-lettered sign said they were married , each to a different man . The living head of a bodiless woman floated in a box near the exit , but even at seven Anna knew that was a trick with mirrors and lights . After the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move more quickly , and she hung on . It would not be long now . She tensed her thighs , clenched inward , and held . He let out a groan , and she contracted once more . She staged a few small flutters , nothing too much . <p> " Goddamn . That was great . " <p> " Good , " she murmured . <p> He patted her breast and rolled to his side of the bed . <p> " Going to sleep ? " he asked . <p> " Yes , " she said to his freckled back . <p> The stale smell of scotch was in her nostrils , and there was slime on her thighs . But it was all right , really it was . It was not so bad , and he was almost asleep . All she had to do was wait . <p> When his breathing became regular , she slid out of bed . She nudged the door closed behind her until she sensed wood pressing on wood . In the bathroom she turned on the overhead lights , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seven bulbs above the mirror . She glanced at her reflection , then looked away , ashamed . <p> The thick strand of hair by her temple , which the sun used to lighten every summer , was streaked with gray , and her large brown eyes were dull beneath swollen lids . Her skin was softer than it used to be , and there was an almond-shaped age spot on her cheek . She was still slender , but she looked older than forty-three . Stanley was right that women aged more quickly than men . She was tempted to flick on the space heater but did not because she might not be able to stop herself from flinging it into the tub once water pooled at her feet . She put a match to the candle , but the tiny flame shivered and died . <p> She loosened the ivory clip and metal pins and released her hair . It covered her breasts and fell below her waist . Stanley liked it long , but it felt heavy enough to drag her down onto her knees . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Isadora Duncan 's silk scarf . <p> Water pounded Anna 's shoulders and scalp . Her vision blurred . She resolved once more that she would not sleep with him when he was drunk . Or sober . <p> She watched water snake down her legs until she was calm enough to scrub . Afterward she patted herself dry and pulled on a plain white T-shirt and thick cotton underpants ; they felt like bandages . He liked bikini pants that were nothing more than ruched ribbon and string , flimsy camisoles , ribbed condoms , shaved pubic hair . Menstrual blood excited him . <p> She listened to make sure he was still asleep and then tiptoed down the stairs to her study , which she privately called a room of her own . <p> She drew the blinds and turned on the light . Wishing she had a key to lock it , she shut the door of her study . She slid off the rubber bands holding together the cracked spine and loose pages of Kosinski 's Painted Bird . She had read it so often that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue . The book fell open to village women savaging Stupid Ludmilla for enticing their men . She believed the words on the page , but she knew that was not how it would go . It would be the men , the soldiers , who would shove a bottle between her legs and kick . <p> Jerzy Kosinski had been a witness to sights like these when he was a child . Now he attended opening nights in Hollywood , skied in the Alps , stayed in European hotels so opulent that his entire income from writing covered only the tips . He was married to an heiress , a woman eighteen years older than he , but he had his own apartment in New York , where he wrote his books and conducted his affairs . In one of the pictures Anna had clipped from a magazine , he wore white jodhpurs and a wicked leather belt for polo ; his naked chest and arms glowed . She felt he saw only her , even though she had read that he practiced in mirrors how to stare into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But where ? And how ? He would not come to northern Wisconsin to fish off her husband 's pier or to stay at the rough cabins down the road . And she never went anywhere . But maybe she would . Maybe Stanley would have an accident coming home from the bars , which beckoned to him at regular intervals along the pine-scented roads . Maybe Stanley would have an affair , and then she would not feel too guilty to leave . It would not be entirely her fault then if he shot himself , as he swore he would if she abandoned him . Or maybe the house would burn down . She looked for flames leaping from the roof every time she returned from her precisely timed walks at dawn . In the late afternoons she listened for the phone to ring and announce disaster . <p> Jerzy Kosinski would sit down next to her on a plane ; he would say they had met . They would talk about when , discuss past lives and dreams . But she knew the real reason he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . She knew exactly why he had lost his voice when he was twelve . Maybe he would tell her how he got it back and where he found the courage to create the life he was living now . <p> She would be so tender with him . She would caress his scars with her lips ; she would cheer and inspire ; she would be his best muse . When he could not write , she would tell him her life . He would find words better than hers , create stories and books . He would be grateful to her . He would learn how to feel ; he would fall in love ; he would take her away . <p> But that is where she stopped . She did not want to make love with him because that always ended in the same place , in the same room , in the same bed , with Stanley . She wanted to wander the countryside with Jerzy , walk down roads lined with trembling trees , sleep in haystacks and barns . Together they would elude soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rain . But for that there would have to be another war . <p> * * * <p> Julie arrived unannounced one afternoon . Anna was glad that Stanley was not home because he wanted people , her old friends especially , to call first , not just drop in . It was for Anna 's protection , really it was , because they lived in such an isolated place . <p> Julie 's companion , Karel , had an accent so thick it reminded Anna of the foolishly cheerful immigrants in striped suits on Laugh In back in the 1960s and of dumb Polish jokes people told Stanley in bars . Jerzy Kosinski had never spoken to Anna , but she was positive that his English was sophisticated and smooth . <p> The top of Karel 's head barely reached Julie 's shoulder , but he called her Julietta and sounded condescending as he explained Pavlov 's dogs and President Reagan 's trickle-down economics . Karel had told Julie 's father she was in good hands and that he wanted to manage her trust fund . Julie said Karel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so far no American university had shown any interest in him . <p> " Where did you meet him ? " Anna asked as soon as he went to the bathroom . <p> " He 's a student in my English as a Second Language class . " Sometimes Julie met interesting men in the lobby of the Palmer House in Chicago or in first-class lounges at airports . <p> " Does n't your husband mind ? " Anna asked . She was embarrassed at how naive she sounded . <p> " Richard does n't know everything of course , but no . He 's too busy moving into his own place . " <p> Anna felt envy so sharp she had to wait before she could speak . " You 're going to live in your house all by yourself ? " <p> " Not for long . Karel will move in as soon as Richard gets his stuff out . That way I wo n't have to pay Karel 's rent . His dentist 's bills are bad enough . " <p> Anna thought that if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would leave Stanley next month . <p> Karel returned from the bathroom and reminded Julie of things she had promised to buy him when they got back to Chicago . He held out his hand for the keys to her white Saab and opened the passenger door for her . <p> Julie ignored him , got into the driver 's seat , and revved up the engine . <p> " Come visit us , " she said , " but do n't bring Stanley . He 's such a downer . " <p> It sounded simple when she said it . <p> * * * <p> Stanley said he did not mind that Anna accompanied Marge , who at half a mile away was their nearest neighbor , to the nursing home . Anna did not have anything in common with her , but it made for an outing . While Anna was on the phone making arrangements , Stanley hunched up his shoulders and grimaced like Quasimodo . Then he lumbered around , scratching his armpits like King Kong to demonstrate how the patients would act . He tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did not try to stop her otherwise . <p> Anna brushed Marge 's mother 's hair and rubbed her feet while Marge produced photographs of vacations and weddings and new babies . She talked about children , grandchildren , great-grandchildren , nieces , and nephews . The frail old woman did not look , but she listened compliantly enough . <p> The nursing home was at the end of a narrow , pitted road , and every time they drove there , Marge worried that if they had car trouble , no one would help unless it happened when the caretakers were changing shifts . But even so the nursing-home staff would be useless , she maintained , because it was made up entirely of overweight women and shifty-eyed ex-convicts . <p> So Anna was not completely surprised when , after some sawing and whirring noises , Marge 's car came to a stop . It sighed and settled in on itself . <p> Marge was afraid to open her door because someone could come whizzing by and cut her off at the knees , so Anna got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the cold air felt good and the hard snow crunched satisfyingly under her boots . The pines were dark blue in the twilight . She wished they were nearer so she could rub their needles to release the scent , but she turned and glanced at the tires . She walked to the other side of the car and looked again . She was not trying to find out what was wrong ; she just liked being outside . <p> Marge rolled down the window . " Anyway , I knew those people were crooks the minute I saw them , " she continued as if they were still sitting in the car or had arrived back in her huge kitchen . <p> " I told Walter we should not rent the house to someone from Poland or Latvia or whatever . They 've stolen my antique teaspoons and God only knows what else . " <p> Marge had sent six letters of complaint to Latvia : one to both Berzinses themselves , two to colleagues they had given as references , one each to their respective department heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed them . <p> Suddenly shots pierced the air , tied hands went limp , a blindfold burst , and blood stained the snow . Anna shook her head to get rid of the sight that came to her all too often . She turned away from Marge , slipped on the ice , and lost her footing . She fell so slowly it seemed she had chosen to stretch out on the frozen ground . She lay on her back , her feet in the road , looking up at the sky . <p> Marge got out of the car and bent over her . <p> " What are you doing down there , " she said , not expecting an answer . " That Dr. Berzins and that doctor wife of his are back in Latvia now , safe and snug in the Soviet Union and out of reach of American law . They do n't care that I 'm upset . " <p> " Marge , maybe ... maybe if you wait the teaspoons will turn up . They 're probably somewhere in your house right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> " Well then , maybe it 's time for you to let it go . People lose things . They lose their possessions and their homes and their countries and their families . They lose mothers and lovers ; they lose their faith in God . That 's just the way it is . After a while you have to put all that aside and try to go on living . " Anna was surprised how certain she sounded . <p> She started to sit up , but Marge was squatting over her . <p> " You just do n't understand , Anna . Nothing like this has ever happened to me . I loved those teaspoons . Plus I 'm a very determined person . I always finish what I start . " <p> " But you have no idea what the Russians will do to them . " Anna winced as barbed wire cut into the soft white flesh of a woman 's arm , and she heard shots again . She spoke loudly , trying to drown them out . " They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Let them , " Marge snapped . <p> Anna reminded herself that Marge always treated her well and that she was the only person besides Stanley who ever took her anywhere , but she disliked herself for not objecting to casual cruelty that sprang from ignorance . When she was still teaching , she used to lead her students gently to consider points of view different from their own . <p> She slid out from under Marge and stood up . Marge 's husband , Walter , did not know anything about cars and he would have trouble finding this place in the dark , so Anna was the one who walked back to the phone at the nursing home . <p> " Beats me why you go with that old bag , " Stanley said , " but all right , I 'll come and get you as soon as I finish my drink . I 've had a hell of a day , but you know you can count on me . I 'll always take care of you , kid . " <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , and say she was going to bankrupt him when she told him she had signed up for driving lessons at the Easy-4-U Driving School . <p> But he only shrugged , " Just do n't expect me to take you . I love you too much to let you kill yourself . " <p> When the instructor arrived to pick her up , Stanley sashayed and waved with a limp wrist to signal that the tall young man was a wimp and gay , but he did not block the way past her dormant flower bed . <p> Andrej introduced himself and motioned Anna into the driver 's seat . He got in on the other side and gave a few simple instructions . <p> " It is n't hard , " he said . " You 've been learning how to drive your entire life by watching others . You do n't have to be macho to drive . " <p> Anna could not tell whether he had seen Stanley 's pantomime or whether he was just making a general statement . But he looked at ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the house . <p> " Forgive me , " Andrej said . " I should n't have said ' your entire life . ' I know that most children do n't grow up in American suburbs , with two parents and two cars , like I did . " <p> Anna liked him for being aware of privilege , which most people were not . He must have noticed her slight accent though , and she hoped he would not question her about her childhood . <p> But he talked mostly about himself , probably because he was so young , thirty-three at most . He had two degrees in wildlife ecology and was working on his PhD . His ambition was to be a good steward of the natural world and to protect all fragile and endangered things . He spent solitary evenings reading and watching the sun set over the lake from his parents ' cottage , and that almost made up for his mindless job , which he needed to make enough money to go back to school . He said he had changed his name from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European and because he believed that older civilizations had far more wisdom than contemporary America . <p> " Excuse me , " he said . " I should n't have called this job mindless . I 'm saying the wrong thing because I do n't usually get to meet a person of your quality . " <p> Anna wanted to know exactly what he meant , but she did not ask because Stanley said she was always fishing for compliments . <p> Andrej met her eyes for a moment . Then he blushed and looked down . His eyes were deep velvet brown flecked with gold , and his shoulder-length thick hair reminded Anna of stalks of wheat drying in summer sun . He did not have Jerzy Kosinski 's olive skin and raven hair , so his dark eyes seemed out of place . Had they been blue , he would have looked like a beautiful young bridegroom in Latvia . <p> " I 'm talking too much . I 'm sorry , " Andrej said . " My sisters all took women 's studies at the University of Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , monopolize conversations , dictate subjects , appropriate verbal space , and silence women . But it 's also because I 'm nervous . I 'd like to get to know you , but I 'm afraid to ask questions because I feel you would n't like that . So I chatter on . I 'm sorry .
