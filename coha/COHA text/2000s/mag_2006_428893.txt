Richard M. Cohen , author of Blindsided , an acclaimed book about his long struggle with MS and two successfully treated bouts of colon cancer , is a journalist and former award-winning television producer . He is married to celebrity TV host Meredith Vieira , with whom he has three children . Both Richard and I have had MS for 30 years . I was honored to speak with him the morning before he received the 2005 Dorothy Corwin Spirit of Life Award from the Society 's Southern California Chapter . How comfortable are you being a spokesperson for people with MS ? I 've made it very clear that I speak for nobody . I said in Blindsided that I write no prescriptions . I claim no wisdom . My answer is an answer , not the answer . So I 'm totally comfortable because I make very clear that I do n't represent any point of view or special interest . But I 've also gotten a very clear reaction to the book : People with MS really want to hear from each other . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 're tired of hearing from so-called experts . I think people want to hear from real people . They want to know how did you do it or how do you do it , or what did you do when this or that happened . I think we help each other a lot more than we realize , by just sharing . Photograph // I 've been speaking around the country to pretty large gatherings of people with MS and they are really not there to listen , but to speak . What I like about these sessions is that I encourage people to talk to each other . I 'm not qualified to lecture on anything . But I might be in a position to facilitate opening up lines of communication . On the Larry King Show , you said you were going on Tysabri . What was your reaction when it was recalled ? The expectations for the drug were off the charts . People came to believe this was the wonder drug that was going to turn lives around . People with MS were devastated when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected anything from drugs . Sure I was willing to try it , and I did have one treatment . It seems the jury 's still out . I 've talked to a lot of people , and there seems to be a consensus that Tysabri is going to come back , possibly in a matter of months rather than years . You take one of the injectables . Do you think it helps you ? For me , it 's all band-aid therapy . If you fit the center of the profile , if you 're younger than I am , if you 're more newly diagnosed , if you 're relapsing-remitting , you may get results . But I 'm older , have had MS for a while , and it 's evolved into **25;4210;TOOLONG on the margins of the profile . I 've been taking interferons for eight years . I do n't think it does a damn thing for me , I just do n't . But at the end of the day , I still do it . Why would n't you do it ? Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millie , and Ben in Hollywood , California . // Do you do any other therapeutic activities , such as yoga or aquatics ? My approach is I drink gin . ( Laughs . ) I 'm not big on religion and I 'm not big on the religion of what you 're supposed to do , how you 're supposed to live , what you 're supposed to eat and drink . I think you just live your life . Like all of us , I try to do stuff that 's healthy . I go to the gym two or three times a week . I believe people with degenerative illnesses that cause weakening and loss of function need to stay strong . I ca n't tell you how many times I 've found myself losing my equilibrium or falling , and whether I use my cane or I grab onto something , I can keep myself on my feet . I can because I 'm physically strong . I also think that going to the gym is important psychologically . I feel I 'm staying a step ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I feel like I 'm doing something for myself . Photograph // What role should we patients have in our treatment ? There are certainly people who want to walk into their physician 's office and turn over all control . Just tell me what to do and tell me I will be better . But my argument is that there are various ways of perceiving " better . " They 're subjective and qualitative and if you really want to find them for yourself , you 've got to take a role yourself . People should go to the doctor and hear things as opinions and suggestions , not orders . We 've evolved from taking what the doctor says as the word of God to questioning it , and becoming more proactive . Any physician who does n't want to be questioned should be your exphysician . Have you found a new career in patient advocacy ? Yes , and not just with MS , but the larger sense of trying to give patients a voice . I think that 's missing right now . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being ill , and the patient 's voice , which I would argue ought to be the loudest , is really the softest . Between the physicians and managed care and powerful institutions , we patients can get lost in the shuffle . And partly , we allow ourselves to get lost . We 're intimidated by all these huge forces . I think patients need to become more aware of what their interests are . People not only can have a voice , they should have a voice and should be active partners in their own care . People should n't be asking their physicians , " What should I do ? " They should be asking , " What can we do ? " Author Affiliation Richard Cohen has a great deal more to say . Look for a continuation of this conversation in a forthcoming issue of InsideMS . Alison Dale is a California-based writer who detailed her experiences with Tysabri in our August-September 2005 issue . // <p>                    @
