<p> Middle East : Time to answer Lebanon 's cries <p> As an Atlantan living in Beirut , I am saddened by the many hasty conclusions I have heard some make regarding Lebanon 's people and government . After 15 years of energetic rebuilding , the Lebanese deserve more than to have their fragile country be destroyed and its people collectively punished for the actions of a non-state actor  --  actions it knew nothing about , did not plan and has denounced . <p> Israel might be able to cut off the head of the snake , but it will always grow a new head . Moreover , those who might be friends or benign neighbors are antagonized by Israel 's middle of the night bombing campaigns and systematic onslaught that terrorize the entire country and create feelings of resentment rather than gratitude . Lebanon 's people and government are pleading with the world for its help and no one can afford to be deaf to their pleas . <p> ROXANE PEYSER <p> Peyser is a lawyer and doctoral student at Georgia State University . <p> Hezbollah 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark . ( " To exist , Israel forced to fight , " @issue , July 14 ) . Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy sworn to Israel 's destruction . Israel 's dilemma is that Hezbollah 's missiles are placed in homes in villages and in densely populated areas . Hezbollah scores points when it kills Israelis  --  and scores propaganda points when Israeli responses inadvertently kill civilians . <p> Hezbollah , as the only armed militia in Lebanon , has a veto on Lebanese decisions . It should have been disarmed under U.N . resolutions and removed from South Lebanon . With Iran and Syria 's backing , it has resisted that . It probably started the current round to distract from Iran 's nuclear standoff . <p> It remains to be seen if the current fighting will seriously dent Hezbollah . Tragically , as long as Iran and Syria stoke the fires , civilians on all sides will suffer . <p> SHAUL LAVAN , Atlanta <p> Politics : Gambling bills display misplaced priorities <p> Gasoline is at $3 a gallon and going up . Our children are dying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care costs are skyrocketing . Health insurance is getting harder to afford . Pension funds are failing . Our schools are overcrowded and the graduation rates are down . Our hospital emergency rooms are closing . <p> So , what does the U.S. House of Representatives do ? It passes a bill to stop us from playing online poker ( " House deals setback to online gambling , " Nation in Brief , July 12 , and " Congress to weigh ban on Web bets , " Business , July 11 ) . The House does n't want people to stop gambling altogether . The bill allows bets online on horse racing , sports events and certain lotteries . Could it be that certain people contribute and some do n't ? <p> Since when do conservatives believe in so much government interference in our private lives ? Are our Republican representatives in the U.S. House really conservatives or just Big Government liberals in Republican clothing , blowing smoke ? <p> FRED BUDIN , Hoschton <p> Effort against voting act slammed , rightly so <p> A politician has his pet proposal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge majority in the House of Representatives . His response ? " Well we only need five votes at the Supreme Court . " ( " Voting act OK 'd in tense House . " Page One July 14 . ) <p> Is this another case of some " liberal " seeking " activist judges " to thwart the will of the majority ? No , it 's the response of U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland ( R-Ga. ) , whose attempt to have Georgia exempted from the Voting Rights Act was overwhelmingly rejected . <p> Is this abject hypocrisy , or has this Republican finally read the Constitution and Federalist Papers and learned that the courts do not exist to rubber stamp whatever the majority of the day wishes to do ? <p> RICHARD MITCHELL , Atlanta <p> Sadness burns on inside , so do n't judge <p> When I read Beverly Beckham 's column , I made a mental note that the friend Beckham described in her column may be clinically depressed ( " When gloom rains on a promising soul , " @issue , July 6 ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to the editor written in response to Beckham 's column that piles on to the argument that people  --  usually women  --  are expected to " buck up " and put on a happy face regardless of the circumstances ( " Some create own joy , some choose misery , " Letters , July 10 ) . <p> I agree that we can choose to be happy , but it 's an inside job . For those on the outside , sometimes it 's easier to judge than to accept , listen and maybe be there for a friend in real need . <p> SALLY McDONALD <p> McDonald , of Chamblee , is a licensed professional counselor . <p> Accident-prone situation worsens <p> As I write this from my home on Moreland Avenue , I am watching an elderly woman being placed in an ambulance after an accident involving her car and a dump truck . Meanwhile , 18-wheelers are backing up on both sides of this skinny four-lane street that serves as an overused short-cut from I-20 to I-675 and the landfills and trucking companies on south Moreland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-285 . These enormous trucks are hurting efforts to improve south Moreland Avenue as they slow noncommercial traffic , add noise and pollute . And if you 're a pedestrian , good luck : Crosswalks on our street are halfway between a bad joke and a suicide mission . <p> The situation is not an accident waiting to happen . In fact , it 's an accident that happens often and shows no sign of lessening any time soon . <p> JOHN MORSE , Atlanta <p> Children significant to our nation 's future <p> At last , some common sense . Columnist Jonathan V. Last points out one significant reason for the perilous decline in the birthrate is that children are no longer an " economic boon " to their parents since those parents will be provided for by Social Security and Medicare ( " Culture sends birthrate to point of peril " @issue , July 13 ) . But he also sounds the alarm that the logical consequence of falling fertility rates is that our culture " can not hope to sustain itself " without the work of young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no children has no future . <p> LINDA WILLIAMS CATTANACH , Blairsville <p> It 's always profits over the patients <p> As a pharmacist with a doctorate who practiced in hospitals for 20 years , I must say that Jay Bookman 's column is the best I have seen on the subject  --  ever ( " Ideology offers way to hide scam , " @issue , July 13 . ) . <p> When I tried to institute a number of reforms in two small-town hospital pharmacies , I was n't prepared for the political implications of what I was attempting . I was immediately met with resistance by the medical staff and the pharmaceutical companies . <p> Instituting a bidding process , use of generics , a restrictive formulary and the elimination of physician 's orders transcribed by an uneducated and untrained ward clerk were seen as creeping socialism ( the drug error rate was astronomical ) . Any suggested change to the status quo was seen as a threat by groups of right-wing physicians who saw a Communist behind every tree . Of course , the pharmaceutical companies were delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were strangely silent . <p> From my perspective , implementation of the Medicare prescription drug plan is a sad joke on the American people and a sop to special interests . By denying Medicare the advantages of the bidding process and disallowing the importation of pharmaceuticals , President Bush has , once again , demonstrated that the so-called free market and competitive free enterprise are good only as long as they result in huge profits for the pharmaceutical companies . <p> RON SLADE SR. , Covington Photo : U.S. Rep.
