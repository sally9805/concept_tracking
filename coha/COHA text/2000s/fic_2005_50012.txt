Kaufman drove from one fire to another . In Baltimore , there had been a train wreck in the Howard Street tunnel , the northern end of which was not far from the small house he owned , tucked away on a side street behind the hulking wreck of a Victorian hotel , and three doors down from a gay bar with no sign or windows . The train was loaded with toxic chemicals , and stuck in the tunnel as it had been , there was little the authorities could do . The downtown air filled with the smell of melted plastic and electrical wire . Temperatures reached one thousand degrees in the tunnel , so hot that the cars glowed . <p> In Jackson , it was wood smoke , thick as a campfire when the wind blew from the south . A whole mountainside was burning . Fat insect helicopters traveled back and forth from the airport , huge baskets dangling under them like egg sacs . Around town , signs everywhere read , " Thank you , firenghters ! " The air hurt your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear ash from the windshield of his Subaru . <p> Everything in the hotel bar gleamed , from the hanging racks of stemware to the long , polished mahogany bar itself to the picture windows in the seating area . They were atop a mesa , with views in all directions . Kaufman felt as if he 'd been somehow transported to the pages of the kind of magazine he 'd never read on purpose . <p> " See that couple ? " said Rhonda . It was cocktail hour at the Rusty Buffalo . After one day working for Irving Straight , Kaufman was already wondering about his decision . The man did huge saccharine oils with titles like Beddin ' em Down , and Chow Time , depicting sunburnt Marlboro men , cows , and horses at twilight . <p> At a table by the window , he observed a woman who looked to be in her mid-thirties , with frizzy dark hair and black plasticframed glasses . The man with her seemed somewhat older , had a shaved head , and looked bored . <p> " Yes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're here through an Internet auction-one of those travel sites . Only when she got here this morning and saw their room , she pitched a fit and said it was their honeymoon . They had room 11 . It 's small , and there is n't any view . She starts crying right there , I mean sobbing . What a show . " <p> " You think she 's lying ? " <p> " Of course she 's lying . She 's some spoiled East Coast chick . " <p> " What did you do ? " <p> " I gave her the honeymoon suite . " Rhonda applied Chapstick to her lips . Her hair was tinted blond , her skin tanned and creased around the eyes , and yesterday Kaufman had noticed a geometric tattoo barely rising out of the back of her jeans , the same as a lot of his students had back in the city . <p> " That was nice of you , " he said . <p> " It was available . With the fire , I 'm getting cancellations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . I really want to push this . There is no way they 're married . I do n't even think he wants to be here , to tell you the truth . " <p> " How do you know ? They 're wearing rings . " <p> " That does n't mean anything-I wear a ring . You get to a certain age , you just do . Hell , he might be married to someone else . Anyway , they 've got reservations for dinner here tonight , and I 've arranged to have a cake appear . I 'm having Paco decorate their table with balloons , and the waitstaff are going to come out and sing . You should have seen her , crying like a six-year-old . Like the world owes her something . Know what I wish you 'd do ? Hit on her . It 'll be good practice for you , and who knows ? Maybe you 'll get lucky . " <p> Kaufman looked again at the woman , tried to imagine starting some kind of conversation . Jackie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never married , had died almost ten years ago , and though he 'd dated on and off since then , it had n't been with much success . There was no one in his life right now , although he liked to think he had prospects-the young blonde he 'd met in his last painting class , for instance , who liked Elvis Costello . Or the antiques dealer he 'd met recently at the Walters on Rhumba Night , who was interested in old maps ( there had been an exhibit on ) . Who was he kidding ? The blonde was twenty-three , maybe younger , while Kaufman was forty-two , surely out of her range . The antiques woman seemed to believe that Greek civilization had followed , and indeed improved upon , that of Rome . He had no prospects . " I do n't hit on married women . " <p> " Here 's what I 'm telling you . That woman is in an unhappy relationship . She might sleep with you just to push things with him " <p> " What would that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Skip . You 're right . You need another drink ? " She was the one who 'd given him the nickname , and he did n't even know why . That was being a younger brother-eight years old , and one day you suddenly had a new name , which no amount of protest was going to change . Even his parents had begun using it . <p> " Please . I had a hard day on the range . " As he said this , he noticed that the man was getting up . <p> " Go downtown and see what Irving 's paintings are selling for . Forty thousand bucks . For that kind of money , maybe you could paint a few Indians . " <p> " It 's kitsch . " <p> " Of course it 's kitsch . What did you expect ? People around here pay a couple of million dollars for a log cabin in the woods that has a Jacuzzi , hot tub , and Sub-Zero , they need something atmospheric for the walls . Irv also happens to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's very highly thought of . " <p> The woman was now alone , and she did seem sad . " I do n't doubt it , " he said . <p> " Ooh . " Rhonda poked his arm . " Go over and bring her another margarita . Compliments of the house . Talk to her . " <p> " How ? " <p> " Just ask her how she 's enjoying herself . " <p> " Maybe , but on one condition . You go do something else . " <p> " All right . I have to make some calls , anyway . But I want a full report . " <p> Kaufman went to the bar , had Dreadlock Larry mix two margaritas , then brought them to the woman 's table . <p> " On the house , " he explained . " I wonder if I could join you . That is , if you 're alone . " <p> " I 'm alone , " she said , eyeing the drink he held out . She motioned with her head toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My husband has gone to the room to play mandolin . " <p> " A musician . " <p> " I did n't say that . " She had high cheekbones , wide-set green eyes . " Are you related to that manager ? " <p> " You 're good . Most people do n't see the resemblance . " <p> " Well , I see it . " <p> " Can I tell you something ? " <p> " What ? " <p> He leaned forward , and was pleased that she did , too . Their faces were only inches apart . He very much wanted to touch her . " My sister does n't believe you 're married . " <p> " Sure she does , " she whispered . " She gave us the honeymoon suite . " <p> " Because you cried . " <p> " I cry all the time . It does n't mean I 'm lying . " <p> Kaufman sat back , and so did the woman . He felt as if they 'd known each other a long while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people having chemistry , but he 'd never quite known what the expression meant . Perhaps this . " All the smoke in the air sure makes for a nice sunset . " <p> " You like sunsets ? " <p> " It 's in my job description . I 'm a painter . I 'm working for a famous Western artist right now , finishing his stuff . I ca n't tell you his name . I had to sign a contract . " <p> " Finishing what parts ? " <p> " Scenery , bodies . He does faces , and he does the underpaintings , but I do a lot of the filling in . Right now , I 'm working on a boulder . " <p> " Is that ethical ? " <p> " A boulder ? " <p> " The whole thing . " <p> " I think so . " <p> She was looking out the window again . The shirt she had on was sleeveless , and her long , thin arms were nicely muscled . " Well , I guess it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . " <p> " Sorry ? " <p> " Married . And this is my cowboy honeymoon . " <p> " My sister 's probably jealous . She 's older than I am , and neither of us is married . " <p> " You ought to try it . It 's everything it 's cracked up to be and more . " <p> " Look at that fire , " he said . <p> " You do n't think we 're in hell , do you ? " She took a long swallow from her drink . <p> He did n't think this was going all that well . " What do you do ? " <p> " I 'm in advertising . I dream up amusing scenarios for selling things . You know those milk ads where a cow comes walking through that family 's living room while they 're watching TV ? That 's one of mine . " <p> Kaufman pretended to know what she was talking about , even though his TV had died two years ago during a thunderstorm , an electric bleat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace it . " Are you from New York ? " <p> She nodded , drew a circle in the frost on the side of her glass with her finger . " Hey , you want to go for a hike tomorrow ? " <p> " Sure . What about your husband ? " <p> " His plantar fasciitis is acting up . I want to do Jenny Lake . " <p> " I 'm supposed to work in the morning , but I could go around one . " <p> " Then we 'll meet at the front desk , " she said , cheerily . " It 's a date . " <p> Kaufman did not stick around for the cake . Instead , he got a burrito at a place in town , walked briefly around the square , looking in the windows of the various galleries and souvenir shops . He felt exhilarated , strange . The salt from the margaritas had left him thirsty , the air did n't contain enough oxygen , and his heart seemed to be working overtime . He saw a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be slow motion , watched all the while by a fascinated collie tied to a parking meter a few yards away . <p> Irving Straight 's studio was a separate building behind a modest house five blocks south of the town center . He 'd shown Kaufman where he hid the spare key under a cinder block beside the house , and now Kaufman let himself in . He liked the clutter of a studio , the sense of work ongoing , the random splotches of color that accumulated on everything . A big oak desk with a combination TV and VCR on it took up much of one wall , and various videocassette tapes were piled up alongside . Straight believed in keeping old Westerns playing for atmosphere . Already , Kaufman had listened to Red River and El Dorado . <p> He went to the painting he 'd been working on and took another look at his boulder . There was a rattle of movement behind him as Irving Straight came in . He was in his late fifties , with white hair he combed straight back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of his face . He wore a droopy handlebar mustache . <p> " A burglar , " he said . " I hope you do n't have a gun . " He went to the boulder and stuck his face right up to the canvas , then backed away . <p> " What do you think ? " <p> " Try a smaller brush . And try to think a little more cowboy . Think Gary Cooper , Randolph Scott , maybe even Lee Marvin . Henry Fonda , for that matter . " <p> " Those are actors . " <p> " I know they 're actors , Art School . That 's not the point . It 's what they embody , the whole spirit of the thing . I do n't know if this is going to work out . " <p> Kaufman looked at his boulder . " I 'll try harder , " he said . <p> " I was n't keen on hiring you , you know , considering the circumstances with Rhonda and me . I thought it might just muddle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to . I used to fix cars for a living . You were a teacher , right ? " <p> Kaufman thought how odd that use of the past tense sounded . He 'd taught his last class less than a month ago . What was he now ? Starting over . A colleague of his had dropped dead back in the spring , and he was only forty-five . Two weeks later , Kaufman had submitted his resignation . It did n't make him feel brave , or even particularly nervous . It felt like the only thing he could do . <p> " Circumstances ? " he asked . <p> Irving Straight took a bottle of water out of the small refrigerator under the window , unscrewed the cap , and took a swallow . " She did n't tell you about us ? " <p> " She just said you were friends . " <p> " I 've known her five years now , but only for the past two was it romantic . Up until last month , when I called it off . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kaufman could still hear the purr and hack of his idling motorcycle outside their house late at night as he 'd drop her off . Her subsequent relationships had all seemed influenced by that unfortunate paradigm , and Kaufman did n't ask many questions . " I did n't go to art school , " he said . " I just took a few classes . " <p> " She wants to get married , " said Straight . " I already did that , thirty years ago , and I was n't good at it . Ask my ex-wife , ask my two kids . What I 'm good at is right here in this room-I paint my pictures , and then I have a girlfriend for my not-painting time . It might sound hard , but it 's the facts . I never represented it different , and Rhonda knew that all along . I hired you because I think you can do the work , not because I feel guilty . That 's all . But you have to show me that you can do the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's not getting it , " he said . " You want to go have a real drink ? " <p> At the Cowboy Bar , the men wore ball-strangling Wranglers with big belt buckles , Western shirts , and mustaches ; the women all had long hair , hip-hugger jeans , midriff-revealing tops , and serious makeup . Everyone had on a hat . Kaufman followed Irving Straight to a table , sat , and ordered the same thing he did-a double Jack Daniel 's on the rocks . He could tell the tourists from the locals fairly easily . In Baltimore , there was only one bar he went to regularly , right in his neighborhood , because he liked their grilled chicken sandwiches . Otherwise , he 'd become a recluse , moving between his living room , the kitchen , the bedroom upstairs , and the spare room where he painted . <p> " Rhonda likes this place , " said Irving Straight . <p> Kaufman looked at his watch and wondered if dinner was over back at the hotel . " How does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I would n't know . The gallery takes fifty percent . But , yeah , I see what you 're driving at . " He cracked a knuckle . " It 's a kick in the ass . " He sipped his drink . " So , look , just tell me one thing . She 's seeing someone new , right ? " <p> " I do n't know , " said Kaufman . <p> " You do n't ? " His eyes hovered behind his lenses like pond creatures . Kaufman had the impression that Irving Straight was honestly surprised by moments when the world appeared not to be entirely about him . <p> " Okay , yeah , she is . A mandolin player . " The band was playing an old Little Feat song that Kaufman recognized , and could remember Jackie singing along to back in their apartment on Calvert Street . The thrift-shop furniture , the tattered stereo speakers up on cinder blocks . Put on your sailing shoes . He 'd have called that rock , back in the seventies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On a talk radio show somewhere near Omaha , he 'd heard a caller say , " I know hindsight is fifty-fifty , but ... " He 'd liked that , even repeated it aloud . As he 'd driven , Kaufman had stored each brief passing image-an abandoned gas station , a collapsing barn , a gleaming new mall set like a child 's toy amid the cornfields-in his mind . These things were unambiguous . <p> " Being an artist means sacrifice , man , " said Straight , poking at an ice cube . " Do n't fool yourself . Happiness does n't have anything to do with it , and neither does getting laid . " <p> Kaufman was awakened by his sister on the phone at a little after seven a.m . His room was similar to the regular guest ones , except that it was located by the service building , which housed gardening equipment and large electric pumps that came on and off all night long . " So , where did you go last night ? " she asked . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaufman picked sleep out of his eyes and squinted at the bright light seeping through the blinds . <p> " Tell me about the margaritas , " she said . <p> " You 're probably right about the husband , if that 's what he is . What happened with your cake ? " <p> " She 's such a phony . They fed each other pieces , and everyone applauded . " <p> " We 're going for a hike this afternoon to Jenny Lake . " <p> " You are ? Now this is exciting . How 'd you manage it ? " <p> " It was her idea . I think he has something wrong with his feet , so he could n't go . By the way , what 's her name ? " <p> " Are you serious ? " <p> " It just never came up . " <p> " Elizabeth Moore . Boring , huh ? Hey , I need you to tend bar for a couple of hours tonight . Larry 's band has a gig , so I gave him the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . " Okay . I got ta get going here , " he said . " I have a boulder to finish , and then later I get promoted to cattle . " <p> Straight was n't at the studio , but he 'd left scrawled instructions on a couple of Post-it notes . The first read , " Do Cows . " On the wall behind the easel there was a rough sketch of what the finished painting was supposed to look like . One cowpoke sat resting against a boulder , holding out a cigarette , while another leaned down toward him , his hands cupping a lighter . A bit to the right was a horse , and in the distance , moving up and toward the vanishing point , were lots of cows , represented at this point by lightly sketched shapes . <p> Do cows . On the canvas itself , Straight had already penciled in the closer cows , as well as their faces . The ones that receded into the distance were probably what he meant , but Kaufman , who was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poked through the stacks of art books piled against the wall until he found what he wanted , a fifteenth-century Flemish nativity scene . The Christ child at the center , casting light outward onto the faces of Mary and some admiring angels , and just off center and far less well-lit , a bovine face , almost thoughtful . Kaufman mixed some paint and set to work copying it onto the face of the second cow back . <p> At one p.m. he was by the front desk , waiting . The air was even smokier today than yesterday . Coverage of the fire was national-Good Morning America had reported that over three thousand acres were ablaze , with no rain in the forecast . Elizabeth Moore came in with a small black backpack and Italian leather hiking shoes . <p> " Sorry I 'm late , " she said . " You ready ? " <p> " Your car or mine ? " <p> " You honestly do n't want to see me drive . " <p> She smelled like vanilla and nervous sweat . He was somewhat embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of the detritus from his cross-country journey-empty fast-food bags , mostly-but she made no comment . They drove up past the airport , toward the mountains that jutted into the sky like jagged blue teeth . She chewed Tic Tacs , shaking another one out of a container every few minutes . <p> " They sang to you , huh ? " he said , after a while . <p> " ' We 've Only Just Begun . ' It was humiliating . " <p> " I warned you . " <p> " It 's harassment . Ca n't two people just be left alone on their honeymoon ? " <p> " You do n't get something for nothing . You wanted a fancy room , you 're paying for it . Lots of people would be happy with free cake . " <p> " I bid on this and won . I guess I should have known the place would be on fire . " <p> " Sort of spur of the moment for a honeymoon . " <p> " Hey " she said . " I 'm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking area and set out on the trail , which went first through forest , paralleled by a gurgling brook , then emerged into an area which was far more open . There were lots of shrubs and short trees , but very few of any size , although quite a number of dead ones poked up like broken phone poles as far as they could see , their silvery trunks the color of polished bone . <p> " This area burned in the early eighties , " Elizabeth said . " I read about it in my book . That 's part of what makes it such a beautiful hike . You can see all around you . " <p> It took an hour to hike to the lake , and they made small talk as they went . She was originally from New Jersey . She 'd once thought she 'd like to be a dancer . She loved dogs . Her favorite movie star was Vincent Price , her favorite movie Theater of Blood . They found a spot to sit . " I brought cheese and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And these . " She held up two brown and beige items about six inches in length . It took Kaufman a moment to recognize them as shoe inserts . " Orthotics , " she said . " I snuck them out of his shoes last night . He 's out wandering the town right now looking for a present for his kid , and I 'll bet his feet are killing him . Funny , huh ? " She made a strange sound in the back of her throat , and her eyes filled with tears . " This is what I 'm reduced to . Stealing people 's orthotics . " <p> " Look , " Kaufman said . He arranged her apple and the piece of cheese on top of the rock beside them . <p> " At work , I 'm known as the funny one . I did tell you I cry a lot . What is that , a still life ? " <p> " Ever paint one ? " <p> " I 'm not what you 'd call artistic . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apple . " He moved over so that he was right beside her . The light was coming from a slight angle . " What colors do you see ? " <p> " Red , " she said . <p> " Anything else ? " <p> " I do n't know . Darker red ? Some brown where there 's that spot . " <p> " Good . How about underneath , just above the rock ? " <p> She sniffed again . " Purple , maybe . " <p> " Something close to that . It 's the reflection of the rock itself . I think it 's more a blue gray . But you 're right . " <p> " Are you going someplace with this ? " <p> He was n't sure . He only knew that he needed to keep her attention . " Being able to recognize colors is the key . That shadow , that 's going to mostly be cerulean blue . Our red on the apple is going to range quite a bit . I see at least five different shades there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The colors are in the light , you know , not the object . They travel in waves . Opposite colors-yellow and violet , for instance-actually seem to tremble when they 're next to each other , because our eyes ca n't adjust for both at the same time . " <p> She picked up the apple and took a bite , then held it out to him . " They 're actually called orthoses . That 's what he calls them . Orthoses . It sounds like calling dibs on birth control pills . " <p> Kaufman took a bite of the apple and chewed . <p> " See , I told you I was funny . " She got up . " You want to head back ? " <p> He did n't move . He should n't have started lecturing her about colors . People did n't care about colors . Most people did n't . It occurred to him that he might never have a normal interaction with the world again . All those days he 'd come into his class waving The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Liberia ? " or " West Bank ! West Bank of what ? " That person seemed someone he 'd dreamed . <p> " Wait , " she said , and turned around . " Come stand behind me . Close . " <p> He did this , almost touching her . She reached back and took his hands , bringing them up under her shirt , placing them on her breasts . " Just hold me , " she said . <p> He looked out at the flat lake , its surface reflecting the blue sky , but darker . They stood that way for a minute , and he closed his eyes , and it was Jackie 's breasts that he touched , though she had never let him-not again , after her diagnosis . After a few months , she 'd moved out to be with her family , down in Virginia , which was where she 'd finished up , spending her last days designing gardens in a small sketchbook . He 'd gone down , of course , taking sick days , vacation days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away one night while he was putting together a lesson plan . Her mother asked for her photograph albums ; her brother wanted her books . The house he 'd bought the following year had a small garden , but he 'd never done anything with it , just let it grow wilder and full of leaves . <p> They took a different route back to town , one that brought them close to the burning mountainside . Kaufman had almost forgotten the smoke after this afternoon in the relatively clean air at the lake , but now he found it irritating to his eyes . On the news , they heard that the fire was twenty-percent contained , which did n't sound all that promising . From various points on the road , they could see it pluming thickly off the mountainside into the sky . He thought again of those train cars stuck in the tunnel , glowing white with heat . <p> When they got back to the hotel , her rental car , a green Dodge Neon , had been decorated with shaving cream , " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white letters . <p> " You could admit it , " said Kaufman . " I 'm sure she 'd let you keep the room . " <p> " Never , " said Elizabeth Moore . <p> Irving Straight came by a few hours later , while Kaufman was tending bar , wearing a freshly pressed tan shirt and a bolo tie . " I was over to see a guy this afternoon , lives in the Indian Paintbrush subdivision . He has to get out of there by tonight . They 're spraying all the houses with slurry in case the fire moves any further down the valley . " <p> " Friend of yours ? " asked Kaufman . It was eight p.m . Earlier he 'd served two nice-looking older women who stared right through him like he was made of glass , but now it was just Straight at the bar . No sign at all of Elizabeth Moore or her not-husband . He had the TV on , sound off , tuned to a cooking show . <p> " Customer-owns three paintings . Should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " None of them . Just a matter of time . These people with money get arrogant . " <p> Kaufman thought of the painting from Pompeii of a woman picking flowers . Of course , it was n't a resident of the town , just a decoration on someone 's wall , but he 'd always thought of it that way , as if he were looking at one last pretty moment in a life before the sudden wave of lava swept down and stopped time . <p> Rhonda came in , wearing a black silk shirt , open at the collar , jeans with high heels , and some dangly Native American-looking earrings . She touched Straight on the shoulder . " Ready ? " <p> " I 'll be there in a second . " <p> Noticing the surprise on Kaufman 's face , she smiled . " Have fun , Skip . " <p> When she was gone , Straight looked at Kaufman and poked him in the chest with a meaty finger . " Sint Jans , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical reference might be fun , " said Kaufman . " Hey , it rhymes with ' Injuns . ' " <p> " It took me over an hour to make that cow back into one of my cows . " <p> " Sorry , " said Kaufman . <p> " Any references in my paintings are going to be to Stagecoach or The Searchers , not the Northern Renaissance . " Straight downed the rest of his drink and smoothed his mustache . " Damn nice brushwork , though , " he said . <p> " You think ? " <p> But that was all the man was going to give him . " This is n't a joke , " he said . " This is what I do . " <p> Kaufman closed up at eleven , locking the register and hitting the lights . He made a brief , unsuccessful attempt at conversation with Shari , the Navajo girl who was working the front desk , then figured he 'd go read in his room for a while before bed . Through the lobby doors , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental car . <p> " Number 5 check out ? " he asked . <p> Shari flipped the page of the People magazine she was reading . " Not to my knowledge . " <p> He pushed his way out into the cool night . " Howdy , " said Elizabeth Moore when she saw him . <p> " It 's late . " <p> " Exactly . But not too late . " <p> The air was full of tiny specks of white ash , suspended , almost weightless , nearly invisible . An owl made a noise like a distant train . <p> " What about what's-his-name ? " <p> " I killed him , " she said . " He 's back in the room . " <p> " Killed him how ? " <p> " Brained him with a mandolin . I 'll need to get going now so I can keep a couple steps ahead of the law . " <p> " If they catch you , they 'll hang you . " <p> " I reckon . " She shook his hand .

I 'm not coming to Baltimore . I barely know where it is . " She sniffed her shoulder . " All my clothes smell like smoke , " she said . " I bet they will forever . " She looked at him , smiled . " Next honeymoon , I 'm going on a cruise . " <p> After she left , Kaufman walked around the grounds . No lights were on in Number 5 .

By the time she realized , it was already too late . <p> From within , Kaufman heard the muted , tinny sound of mandolin strings being tuned .
