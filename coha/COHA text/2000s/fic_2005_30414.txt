But Come Ye Back A Novel in Stories Chapter One Cemetery Sunday On the moving day itself , everything went beautifully , straight on from the moment Mary woke to a sliver of bright July sunlight under the hotel-room drapes with the idea that this whole undertaking was courageous . The extravagance of the thought tickled her , and she grinned , listening to Lyle 's steady breathing , but why not ? The last time she and Lyle had carried labeled cardboard boxes upstairs and stacked them in uncurtained rooms , their boys had been small , and they 'd been moving from near Boston to near Cleveland , and she 'd believed then she 'd never move house again . And yet here they were , Lyle at sixty-five and she at sixty , having sold that house and posted their belongings across the ocean to start , again , a new home , in Galway , the town of her childhood . She and Lyle had been back in Galway only two days , just long enough to get adjusted to the time difference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and she 'd written and telephoned , and her sister , Risn , had given advice , and everything was arranged . All those belongings ( the best bed linens and table linens and crockery , the photo albums and special Christmas ornaments , the childhood presents and homemade cards from the boys , and  --  in the bottom of a box marked MARYWINTER , with a few things that had been her mother 's  --  the old necktie box containing her own plait , cut off when she left Ireland thirty-four years ago to marry Lyle ) , all those cherished things she needed to make a home , sat in boxes in a storage locker , to be brought in by Risn 's grandson Barty in his truck . Risn 's husband , Michael Carey , would go with him and oversee ; since his heart attack last year , he was n't allowed to lift , and Barty , with his earrings and all , was n't a boy to send without supervision , Risn herself said . The furniture Mary and Lyle had chosen last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyle would supervise all that unloading and setting up . Mary and Risn would direct the boxes and keep tea coming . Mary took the sunshine as a blessing on this brave new life , and she let nothing in the day shake her from it . When the men from Tom Dempsey 's Furniture were late arriving , she said , " Why , now we 'll have the chance to dust the moldings before the rooms are filled with things , " and when Lyle grumbled , she sent him off to the shop two streets over for the newspaper and bread and tea . " By the time you 're back , they 'll have your chair in the sitting room , " she said , and they did . They were fine lads , too , cheery and strong , and it did her heart good to hear their young voices in the new house ( though Lyle went on grumbling as he told them where to put the things they unloaded  --  " Seems like they 'd know the difference between a kitchen table and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and she said back , laughing , " Ah , they do , but they 're not so sure an American would agree ! " ) . She thought Lyle was heroic , too , coming away with her to a foreign country where he knew nobody . She 'd seldom thought of returning until after their boys were off on their own , but then , when Lyle retired , and more and more of their friends moved away to Florida or back wherever they 'd come from , the rare thought had become a wish . Back here , she and Risn would go about together : they 'd talk of their parents and the world as it had been when they were Mary and Risn Curtin , girls together ; they 'd share their worries about their grown children . The sea would be near , and butter would have a taste to it , and she 'd understand the weather ; she 'd get to know her brothers ' wives , and her brothers , who had still been boys when she left . Lyle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been from Mayo ( though he 'd died before Lyle knew him , and Lyle had never made any great claim to Irishness , that foolishness of so many Americans about green beer and claddagh rings ) . She 'd had no family at her wedding and had lived almost forty years far from home for his sake , and she wanted to grow old among her own people and be buried among them in a grave with flowers planted on it and curbing all around . When she 'd finally brought up the subject of moving , she 'd been ready to say all that , but it had n't been necessary . She 'd just said she wanted to be near her sister and her brothers , and he had nodded  --  they 'd been eating chicken , she remembered  --  and said he 'd look into it . A week later he 'd said it looked like a plan , and for all that he 'd explained to her the economic advantages ( this fine two-bedroom , semidetached house had cost less than a new condo in Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings on heat , the reasonable approach to health care ) , she took it as an act of love . So none of the grumbling he did that moving day touched her at all , and none of the small difficulties made any real bother either . If the box spring rubbed off a patch of paint in the upstairs corridor as the lads turned it at the top of the stairs , take it for a sign : she 'd not been so very fond of that grayish white color , and once they were settled in , Lyle might enjoy a project of painting it something brighter . A bit of summer rain never hurt anyone , and if Barty tracked dirt on the carpet bringing in the damp boxes from the truck ... But Come Ye Back
