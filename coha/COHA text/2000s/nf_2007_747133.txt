Drug problems are by no means new phenomena for the Czech Republic . The Austro-Hungarian monarchy ( that included the Czech Kingdom until 1918 ) had a special law on " using opium with children " as early as the middle of the 19th century ( Gajdoskov 2001 ) , and during the early 20th century , both " cocaine madness " and " morphinism " were not only concentrated among popular actors and actresses , but were also present in all social strata of the first Czechoslovak Republic . After WWII , the communist " putsch " effectively cut off Czechoslovakian citizens from contacts with the free world , and those wanting to experiment with psychotropic substances responded by developing their own unique patterns of use . For example , these early experimenters extensively abused pharmaceutical products and rediscovered that some psychoactive drugs did not require imported products for their manufacture ; and some required no plant material at all ( Zbransky , 2004 ) . <p> The prevalence of the use of drugs other than alcohol and marijuana in Czechoslovakia was probably not dramatically different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments , although these figures never reached the levels we have observed in the United States . Where the German and Austrian " junkies " used heroin , Czechs and Slovaks cooked their own " brown "  --  a potent hydrocodone-containing drug . At the same time that crack first appeared in American urban centers in the mid-1980s , numerous small groups of young addicts of both sexes in Prague , Ostrava , and Brno were using pervitin-methamphetamine that was hand produced in numerous kitchens in relatively small quantities with astonishing ease , and from freely available products . LSD and psilocybin use have long traditions in the Czech Republic , and these substances were part of extensive research focusing on treatment methods in the 1960s ( Roubcek &; Srnec , 1955 ; Roubcek , 1962 ; Vojtechovsky &; Grof , 1960 ; Grof , Vojtechovsky &; Votava , 1960 ) . <p> Under communist rule , the specter of drugs differed significantly from that found in the free world . Drug abuse was viewed as a minor deviation of perverted youths . Consequently , until the mid-1980s , no official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighties , the media only rarely depicted illegal drug use in society . Throughout this period , the general public kept quiet , although a few whispered about strange " dope-heads. " ( n1 ) Those who actually experienced drug-related problems themselves or in their families kept quiet about it even more , fearing public disdain and perhaps even dire consequences  --  including possible arrests and coerced treatments ( the latter could occur at the whim of a psychiatrist and without any trial ) if they were discovered . <p> The relative secrecy attached to drug use and related problems quickly evaporated after the fall of communism . The return of freedom of movement of persons and commodities made Czechoslovakia ( that was soon to split peacefully in 1993 into western Czech and eastern Slovak Republics ) an ideal market for " Western " drugs . Interestingly , neither crack nor powder cocaine made any inroads in these markets and never threatened the privileged position held by traditional methamphetamine ( called pervitin ) . In sharp contrast , heroin nearly took over the opioid black market around 1993 and still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been available since 2003 . <p> It was mainly heroin users and the open drug scene that emerged adjacent to the Square of the Republic in the very heart of historic Prague that first attracted media attention in 1992 and 1993 , resulting in the first Czech moral panic about drugs . Many Czechs responded to these alarming and lurid details by saying that drug use had not previously existed . What they failed to understand was that it had in fact existed before  --  what had changed was its visibility . At this point too some politicians claimed this topic as their own , glibly blaming " boundless liberalism. " ( n2 ) for the existence and visibility of this phenomenon . <p> In 1993 the first National Drug Commission was appointed , although its power was rather limited . The establishment of the commission was important for several reasons : first , it fostered a multi-disciplinary , integrated , and coordinated approach to the resolution of drug related concerns ( see Radimecky , in this issue ) ; secondly , it reflected the quick entry of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention , treatment , and harm reduction and established the first mechanisms for sustaining these programs ( see Kalina in this issue ) . Importantly , the first executive administrator of the drug policy , Kamil Kalina , was a certified drug expert and not a politician , which proved to begin a tradition of extreme importance in the developments that followed . The following two drug " czars " were also drug experts prior to their appointment to office , and their lengthy tenures in that position allowed them to build a solid foundation for the policy . <p> The real breakthrough in the structure of drug policy probably occurred during the terms served by the second drug czar , Pavel Bm , who is a psychiatrist and an expert in the addictions field . Under Bm 's leadership the base for a coordinated  --  and at least rhetorically " balanced "  --  system of drug policy involving prevention , treatment , repression , and harm reduction was created and legislatively supported . Pavel Bm also stressed the role of research and development in an evidence-based drug policy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , in 1995 , he set up the infrastructure for the first attempt to establish a national monitoring system . During his tenure , the pressure brought to bear by Christian Democrats and Communists resulted in an amendment of the Czech drug laws that recriminalized the possession of drugs for one 's own use  --  a step that Bm explicitly opposed . Bm 's opposition displeased some Christian Democrats , who suggested that his role was not to give his expert opinion , but to use his expertise to support political decisions made by the government ( see , e.g.Gabal , 1997 ) . Before Pavel Bm left office in 1998 to pursue a political career ( he currently serves as Lord-Mayor of Prague ) , he authorized and funded a major project evaluating the impact of the new drug legislation . <p> The third and longest serving drug czar , Josef Radimecky , provided unequivocal and sustained support for evaluation research that was to be supervised by two Florida State University professors ( see Bullington in this issue ) . Radimecky , who served for six years , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bm  --  establishing a firm base for NGOs by providing them with sustainable financing through a grants system , establishing harm reduction as the official " fourth pillar . " ( n3 ) of Czech drug policy , and preparing a comprehensive set of guidelines and quality standards for drug treatment providers . Last but not least , under Radimecky 's leadership several drug policy processes and drug monitoring programs were initiated and successfully completed in advance of the Czech accession to the EU . The main achievement in this regard was represented by the establishment of the Czech Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Addictions. ( n4 ) Radimecky became the second drug czar to fall victim to ongoing ideological struggles ( n5 ) over the character of Czech drug policy . His service in the position of drug czar was actually framed by two separate struggles occurring in 1998 and 2004 . <p> The evaluative study mentioned above , called PAD , was commissioned by the government at the end of 1998 , days before the legislative change came into effect . In it researchers were asked to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the prevalence and incidence of different forms of drug use and to drug-related harms that had occurred after the recriminalization of possession for personal use had gone into effect ( for details , see Zbransky , Mravck , Gajdoskov , &; Miovsky , 2001 ; Zbransky 2004 ) . PAD was a typical ecological study , since there was neither a " control group " nor any way to directly measure the impacts of the new law at the individual level by using typical quantitative tools . Striving to overcome this handicap , PAD relied heavily on qualitative methods . The project also implemented several economic evaluative designs . <p> Ultimately , the study results were described in the words of the principal investigator in the study ( Zbransky ) : " Nothing significant really happened , although a great deal of money was spent in the effort to implement the new law . " This conclusion was hardly surprising : the limited impact of drug policies on the incidence and prevalence of drug use has been extensively analyzed in previous studies ( e.g. , Reinarman , Cohen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of such efforts on drug harms and on other crimes and changes caused in patterns of drug use and by shifts in police priorities ( Rasmussen &; Benson , 1994 ; Benson , Leburn , &; Rasmussen , 2001 ) . These observations were confirmed in the Czech Republic : the qualitative PAD substudies suggest that there have been some shifts to more risky patterns of use ( such as sniffing of freely available solvents instead of continuing to snort and inject illegal drugs ) , and we have also seen a rapid merging of the " recreational drug " market ( mainly cannabis and to a far lesser extent ecstasy ) with the " problem drug " market ( heroin and pervitin ) . <p> The government acknowledged the results of the PAD study and subsequently specified a set of intervention measures that it would support ( Vlda Cesk republiky , 2001 ) . The government decided not to abandon the controversial drug possession amendment , however , introducing instead measures that included a commitment to " classify the illegal drugs into two or three groups according to social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for details , see Zbransky , 2004 ) . After a lengthy review process , this resulted in a government proposal to amend the drug laws by classifying illegal substances into two distinct categories-vegetable drugs ( essentially , herbal cannabis and psilocybin mushrooms )  --  and " others , " with severe penalties for the latter violations while easing existing penalties ( but not decriminalizing ) for the first group . This consensual government proposal ignited a fierce reaction by the head of the Police National Drug Squad who was subsequently supported by the People Party/Christian Democrats ( PP/CD ) . The PP/CD began to call for a " U.S.-like drug war , " although this move was strongly opposed by a majority of influential members in other political parties ( except for the communists ) , by all national associations of experts , and by the drug czar , Josef Radimecky . The importance of consistent empirical monitoring of the drug situation in accord with EU standards proved to be very important for rejecting the claim of a " worsening drug situation in the Czech Republic " that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs by the National Drug Squad head and his supporters . <p> After running up against this unexpected opposition , Christian Democrats began to retreat . In doing so , this most recent attempt to turn Czech drug policy into something " more American " failed . However , the head of the Christian Democrats sought a scapegoat to offset his defeat  --  and found him in the form of the drug czar whom he labeled a cannabis " legalizer . " As a result , Radimecky was dismissed in December 2004 . During its first 2005 session , the new government approved , without changes , the Drug Strategy 2005-2009 that had been prepared earlier by Radimecky , and his team . In April 2006 , the Parliament approved the government 's proposal for the new two-pronged classification of illegal drugs ; however , because that legislative package contained several other profound changes of the legal code , it was returned by the Senate ; it is expected that it will finally be approved by the end of 2007 . <p> In thinking about these significant events , we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EUropeanization " of the Czech drug policy in both form and content , and more specifically , by the significant attention paid to , and support of , ongoing research and monitoring processes that should lead to evidence-based decision making in future drug policy deliberations . The institutionalization of the monitoring body , the Focal Point , might serve as the best example of this trend . Most of the papers in this special issue reflect data that was collected at least partially under the Focal Point initiatives . <p> The editors have spent a number of years talking about , organizing , and completing this special issue of the journal . We are especially pleased to finally see the thing come to fruition , as there were times when it all looked quite " iffy . " Bruce Bullington 's first trip to the Czech Republic took place in 1996 , and following that experience there have been a number of other occasions when he was able to travel there and spend time observing some of the drug policy activities of the National Drug Commission and to participate actively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement issues . Czech friends and researchers have proven invaluable co-evaluators in these attempts to begin to see some of the ramifications of legal changes taking place in the drug laws at the end of the 1990s . <p> It would be presumptuous of us to suggest that this account is adequate in providing a clear understanding of the significant alterations in drug policy that have occurred there during the last decade or so . Rather , we have tried here to capture some of the complexity of the issue in terms of the conflicts that exist between different participants in the policy debate , while recognizing that this can only be a small slice of the total picture . The future of that policy and its aftereffects are yet to be determined , but the most encouraging aspect of all of this has been that transparency now seems possible in future deliberations and the contending parties will demand that as the discussions continue . <p> This issue provides readers with a series of papers that elucidate a number of drug-related concerns in the emerging Czech Republic . As noted above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are represented here , although we have tried to present as wide a range of topics as possible within the confines of a single text . American readers should keep in mind that the drug use patterns observed in the Czech Republic pale in comparison with those found within our own country . The data described in these papers suggest that Czech youths 16 years of age have maintained very high lifetime prevalence rates of marijuana use since 1995 , although their repeated use prevalence for that drug is about average , only slightly higher than that found in other European countries . On the other hand , the problem use of hard drugs is much lower in the Czech Republic than is typical for European countries , and about half that found in the United States . <p> The issue begins with a paper by Josef Radimecky , which provides a historical account of the emergence of modern Czech drug policy during the 1990s . Shortly after the communist defeat in 1989 , the first drug policy strategy was unveiled in 1993 . Since that time there have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Drug Policy Strategy 2005-2009 . Radimecky , points out that there has been , and continues to be , a disjunction between the recent document 's call for " evidence-based " policy and the realities of drug politics . He identifies the key players in these deliberations and assesses their preferred approaches to the drug policy dilemma . The author suggests that ongoing research efforts can provide the empirical data necessary to adequately evaluate various policy initiatives . Without that evidence base , policy can bear no relation to the reality that exists with regard to drug use and abuse . <p> The second article in the issue has been prepared by Petr Zeman , and focuses on the history of drug legislation in the Czech Republic . Zeman traces drug legislation history in the nation from 1852 to 2005 , focusing primarily on penal law and government responses to unlawful acts related to drugs . The paper is especially helpful in describing and discussing the most recent Czech drug legislation , along with relevant court decisions and enforcement practices . This paper provides readers with a thorough understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these have served as lightning rods for the ongoing drug policy debate . <p> The third paper by Michal Miovsky assesses the changing patterns of drug use in the country , with special emphasis placed on the post-communist era . Miovsky is an outstanding young drug scholar who is rapidly establishing a reputation as one of the country 's best and most knowledgeable drug researchers . In this piece he describes what is known about drug use in the Czech Republic during the communist era and laments the fact that so little qualitative research was done during that time period . Given the secrecy within which drug users typically operate , and especially under the repressive communist regime , qualitative methods would have been ideal strategies for learning more about user groups . At the time , however , these methods were looked down on by the leading intellectuals as they were not " hard science , " and therefore they were seldom used . More recently , the situation has changed dramatically , and Czech researchers are now routinely utilizing a wide range of qualitative methods to study drug using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences while describing how preferred drug substances have changed over time and the groups are involved in contemporary drug use . <p> A paper by Pavla Lejckov and Viktor Mravck looks at the mortality statistics associated with hospitalized drug users in the Czech Republic . Until recently there were no data related to this concern , although these figures can serve as vital information for policy makers . The study reported here assesses mortality rates among a large group of hospitalized users covering the years of 1997 to 2002 . Not surprisingly , drug user mortality rates are much higher than those found in the general population . However , when compared with other European and non-European countries , these rates are much lower than those found elsewhere . One significant finding was that there were no AIDS related cases observed in the study cohort . <p> The fifth paper by Ladislav Csemy , Pavla Lejckov , and Petr Sadlek reports on the rates of substance use found among Czech adolescents , comparing these with those found in the international context . Using standardized questionnaires that were originally developed here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes that have taken place in Czech drug use trends among this most vulnerable population . It is clear from this information that many of the trends observed elsewhere in Europe are now being duplicated in the Czech Republic . For example , the apparent link between high rates of drug use and social deprivation and related problems has been found here as well . <p> A paper by Pavla Lejckov , Viktor Mravck , and Josef Radimecky , provides regional comparisons of drug use throughout the Czech Republic . The authors were able to document that a relationship exists between the presence of environmental risk factors and the incidence and prevalence of use . That is , areas experiencing the highest levels of social problems generally are also those where high rates of drug-related problems occur . It is the author 's contention that this information can now be used to help direct needed resources to those areas that are most in need of them . <p> The next paper in the issue has been prepared by Toms Zbransky and relates to the special place of pervitin ( methamphetamine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communist regime , well organized friendship groups of users prepared this drug for their own consumption , and pervitin use served as the dominant form of hard drug consumption at that time . The popularity of pervitin in Czech drug culture remains significant today , although heroin and several other drugs have made some inroads as well . Zbransky provides a wide-ranging account of stimulant use in this part of the world and the unique place that such drugs have played , and continue to play , among Czech users . <p> In a paper describing the system of drug treatment services that exist in the Czech Republic , Kamil Kalina provides readers with a comprehensive account of intervention efforts there , both past and present . He notes that under the former regime , treatment efforts were largely a result of the efforts of a charismatic physician , Jaroslav Skala , who singlehandedly established a comprehensive system of drug and alcohol treatment . For many years that well organized system provided the backbone of all Czech interventions for these problems . More recently Kalina describes the emergence and growing importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite this development , the latter group continues to suffer chronic budget shortages and funding problems , although Kalina remains hopeful that these difficulties can be addressed in the future . <p> The final article in this issue , a retrospective account by Bruce Bullington of his experiences in working with Czech colleagues over the last 10 years or so , reflects on some of the salient concerns that became apparent as the Czechs attempted to wrestle with the emerging drug trends of the 1990s and now in the first decade of the twenty-first century . He notes the various parties in these disputes and the political nature of all drug policy deliberations . Ultimately he argues that the changes observed throughout this period are healthy signs that a vibrant Czech drug policy debate will continue and that future policy efforts will be more closely tied to empirical research than was the case earlier . <p> We hope that you enjoy this special issue . It has been a long term labor of love , and we are happy to finally see it completed . ACKNOWLEDGMENT <p> We would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert work in translating several articles for this issue of the journal from Czech to English . Footnotes <p>
