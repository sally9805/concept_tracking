STORY Not long after he had been laid off at the truck plant , Wayne lost his new car to the bank , and his girlfriend broke up with him and moved away from Baton Rouge to Atlanta . He had to relocate from his condo to a garage apartment where the floors creaked and the water heater made a sound all night like boiling eggs knocking together in a pot . In the local paper he saw no ads that required his skills , but a new business in town , the Something for Nothing Floating Casino Corporation , ran a large announcement that the boat was hiring for " certain positions . " He took a cab down to the river and was interviewed by a combed-back , portly gentleman wearing a chalk-stripe suit . " Are you a good swimmer ? " the interviewer asked , reading from a list of questions . Wayne told him that he had been a certified lifeguard in high school , and when the interviewer heard this , he smiled and looked over the front of his desk into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That 's about right . " " Hey , I know waists . I used to sell suits at Loeb 's before the downtown store closed . You 're not the only one that 's made a career change . " The interviewer opened his desk drawer and pulled out an invoice . " Let me have your inseam so I can order uniforms for you . " " What kind of work are you hiring me for ? " The interviewer clicked a pen and began to write . " You 'll be in , ah , inspection . Mainly on the riverbank . " Wayne sat in the glass guardhouse at the edge of the parking lot sniffing the dye in his new gray uniform . Down the bank in the Mississippi River , the Something for Nothing floated in the greasy current looking like a wedding cake decorated by a lunatic . The roofline of every deck was crowded with blowtorch-made , serpentine gingerbread , a turquoise-and-lavender pattern repeated on the boxy landing building and along the top of the parking-lot fence . Wayne thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of his previous job at the truck factory where he had made $37.81 an hour in a vast , clean plant in which everything made sense . The mirror paint jobs of the leather-upholstered trucks had reflected logic as they bobbled off the assembly line on their way to farmers and carpenters all over America . The plant had shut down because , he was told by a foreman , " It makes more sense for it to operate in another state . " Wayne could not imagine what such a statement meant . The casino manager apprenticed him to Mr. Joey , a slim , meditative man in his early forties . Mr. Joey shared the guardhouse with him and at the moment was pointing to an aluminum skiff tethered against the bank . " I want you to take that little boat and run it around the casino a couple times . Get the hang of it , you know ? " Wayne studied the skiff . " Okay . But why do we need a boat ? " Mr. Joey looked down at his shiny black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the main office ? " Wayne scratched an arm where the shirt fabric made him itch . " They just asked me about 900 times if I could swim . What 's with that ? " Mr. Joey put his hands out in front of him , as if he were showing the length of a fish . " Here 's the deal . This boat 's had some bad luck , you know ? Now and then we get a customer that 's real mental . He 's maybe depressed and loses too much . " Wayne glanced back down to the skiff , which carried two inches of rainwater from an early-morning squall . A Luzianne bailing can floated against the seat . " I hope this ai n't going where I think it 's going . " " Hey , you a grown-up . What , twenty-six years old , your papers said . " He took a short comb from his rear pocket and ran it straight back through his hair . " You can understand when a customer loses big , sometimes he do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . " Wayne turned toward the Missis // sippi and watched a loaded tanker coming down from Exxon , pushing a mound of beige river up its bow . " Then what happens ? " " I do n't know what happens to the ones that walk home . But at this boat , maybe once every two months , one of them jumps in the water . " " Oh , shit . " Mr. Joey put a hand on his shoulder . " Hey , other boats got this problem , too . Just not as bad as us . " Wayne looked at the Something for Nothing and its narrow shelves of open deck space . A woman stepped out on level three , not letting the door close , and gazed up the hill at Baton Rouge as if to confirm the presence of a real world outside the dim violet fantasy of the casino . She regarded the gloss-white deck , ceiling , and bulkheads and after a moment was scalded by the light back into the dark racket of the slot machines . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suicide skiff . " Running his thumb down the music of his comb , Mr. Joey said , " No , we 're lifeguards . " Wayne sat down on a lavender chair . At the subdivision pool he had been a veteran at rescuing the nine-year-olds who had wandered out of their depth . He stopped children from running and even broke up fights between hormone-wracked boys driven crazy by budding subdivision girls burnished beautiful by sunshine and pool chemicals . One day , during his third year at the pool , a fourteen-year-old girl insisted on diving repeatedly into the deep end , even though she had trouble swimming to the edge after she came up . She was thin and went into the water like a spear , but after her girlfriend towed her out twice , and after he had to drop in to help her when she stayed on the bottom like she had forgotten where the sky was , he made her stay on the other side of the rope at eight feet . And then two busloads of third  --  grade children arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringed by runners and screaming teachers helpless in dresses . A boy bubbled under at six feet , and Wayne jumped in for the rescue , several shrieking third-grade girls fluttering to him like ducks after bread , hanging onto his neck , pulling his hair . He brought up the boy and in the hubbub did not hear the word " Mister , " or half heard it as he backed the raft of hollering kids into shallow water . He saw a boy with tomato-red hair running alongside the pool and yelled for him to stop at the same time as the boy mouthed , " Mister , Mister , " and later , while Wayne told the teacher that the sputtering child he 'd handed to her should be made to sit on the bus , the redheaded boy came in close and pleaded , " Mister . " Wayne shook the water out of his ears and looked at freckles that covered the boy like red ants and heard , " Mister , there 's a big girl in the deep end . " He went under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the eight-foot rope , his eyes open , and after forty feet he saw the one-piece aqua swimsuit the same color as the pool paint and the gray-white arms and legs coming out of the cloth , still and drifting . When he brought her to the surface , her mouth was open and filled with water like a pitcher . He laid the girl on the hot apron and worked on her , the teachers called the rescue squad and they worked on her , but again she would n't listen and stay where she belonged . And the worst part of it all was going to the funeral and explaining two dozen times why he had n't been able to bring her back to her family . For three days Wayne and Mr. Joey sat in their little building made to parody a steamboat pilothouse , purple vinyl filigree running along the roofline , a domed top sprouting a gilded , bird  --  streaked ball . Whenever a customer stepped out onto a riverside deck , a security camera would examine him , and an employee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker clipped to Wayne 's uniform shoulder would snarl out a code , and he and Mr. Joey would run the skiff around the casino , cruising slowly alongside , inspecting the hull , dawdling in the rolling , mud-pungent current , pointing at rust spots and algae until the customer returned to the howling machines . Wayne began to jump every time the speaker on his shoulder made a noise . He watched the eyes of customers who walked near the guardhouse , trying to tell if any were depressed or desperate , trying to tell the future . Mornings were the most dangerous times , Mr. Joey told him . The management wanted a strong swimmer on site before sunrise because if a poor soul is destined to become despondent after a night of losing everything , first light is the trigger . " Nothing kills off a bad fantasy like sunshine , " Mr. Joey said . One day , Wayne was thinking about this as he walked up to the guardhouse at false dawn , the Mississippi steaming behind it like a sliding lake of phenol and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaner as the sun came up across the river and charged the mists with heat , the whole July morning beginning to glow like gas in a fluorescent tube . Through the brightening panes he watched clouds rise , mile-high sooty mollusks burgeoning toward thunderhead . Mr. Joey slouched in a chair , asleep behind his dark glasses . The air conditioner in the guardhouse cycled on , and when Wayne put his hand out to the window , he could already feel heat percolating off the pane . He began to worry about the all-night gamblers who might look through one of the few windows and understand that nothing could hide from the sun . The radio snorted , and Mr. Joey wiggled his nose . " Four B , " the radio said . Mr. Joey sat straight up . Four indicated the fourth deck , B meant an intoxicated customer . In the security handbook , C was a conflict on deck . There was a D in the book , but only white space after it . The radio buzzed an electric yell of " Four D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seated in the skiff , Mr. Joey 's spatulate fingers pulling on the starter rope , Wayne in the bow yanking the tether free . " Heads up . " Mr. Joey gunned the engine and Wayne leaned away from a lavender plank of the imitation paddle wheel zinging at his head . The skiff arced around the back of the casino , climbed a rolling swell cast by an upbound tanker , and surfed down into the trough . Above them they heard a yell . A white-shirted security guard on the fifth deck pointed down to where a sour-faced man , potbellied and balding , was sitting on the rail , both skinny legs dangling over the water like disconnected cables . Mr. Joey said , " Okay , boy , now 's when you earn your keep . " The man lost his grip and cartwheeled into the muddy river . Wayne tipped overboard , stroking toward a bubbling swirl where he hoped he could reach in and pull the man out of the current like a rabbit from a hat . As he beat down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface , holding his breath , beginning to have second thoughts . The big guard on the upper deck waved his arms and shouted , " Over here . Hey , over here . " Wayne swam downstream a few yards and his knee touched something soft , so he went under . Reaching out like a swooping bird , he grabbed blindly , imagining that his hand would soon fill with something-dirt from Minnesota or a waterlogged , half-burned stick  --  and when he grabbed a handful of pliant cotton shirt , he was startled , granted more than he expected . He hauled back on the cloth and kicked for the surface , where he jerked the water from his hair , and brought up next to him a head , spitting water and gasping , a cyanic face that opened mouth and eyes , taking everything in at once and not thinking much of it . " Let me go , " the face croaked . The man began to fight , and Wayne 's rising anger surprised him . This one was not going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're going to the bank with me . " " Let me drown . " He raised his lardy arms and flailed at the river . It was obvious he could not swim . Wayne circled his right arm around the man 's chest and began to stroke to the skiff with his left . " Be still . I ca n't turn you loose . " Mr. Joey steered the boat in close , reached over , and grabbed the jumper by his belt , hauling him in like a spent fish . He placed a foot on the man 's biceps and then lifted Wayne , who tumbled in next to the man 's legs and let out a whoop . Wayne was trembling and his mouth was full of the turpentine and almond taste of the river . " Why in holy hell did you jump ? " The old man propped himself against a seat and wiped beads of river off his bald head , blinking up at the sky as though he expected something to fall out of it and crush him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne looked at him the way he would stare at a hound that had wandered out onto an interstate . The skiff swung toward an eroded piece of riverbank next to the guardhouse . " What 'd you lose ? " The man put his head down . " Bank account . " " Well , that do n't ... " " Checking account . CDs . Paycheck . Maxed the credit cards . " His voice rose and he picked up his head . " No machine on God 's green earth could put you in a bind like the one I been feeding . " " So then you threw yourself away , " Mr. Joey said . The man cut his eyes sharply . " Why not , son of a bitch . I 'm about all I got left . " " Here we go , " Wayne said quickly , stepping out and pulling the bow ashore . He put a hand out to the jumper and did n't know what to say . " Watch your step , " he finally told him . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The casino manager , Mr. Dominic , was standing next to the guardhouse dressed in a dark gray suit with the lapels perfectly rolled , the pleats in his pants like razor blades . Next to him stood a large athletic man Wayne had seen many times around the casino ; everyone called him Puck . He held a little radio to his ear and listened as if a superior intelligence were telling him everything . Puck nodded and pocketed his receiver , coming to the skiff and helping the man up the bank as if he were an old relative who had slipped in a supermarket aisle . " Hey , you Mr. Bradruff , right ? Live up by Government Street ? " Puck had a soft friendly face , a voice like elevator music , and two long thin scars lining his jaw . Bradruff struggled up to the parking lot and began to weep . Puck put out a huge arm and gathered him in . " Hey , it 's all right . Everybody has a bad day at the tables once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne was afraid he might put his cheek down on the top of Bradruff 's slick head . A black Cadillac idled up to the guardhouse . Its door opened , and Puck walked Bradruff over to it where they were miniaturized in the vehicle 's glossy black windows . When Puck separated from the smaller man , his suit was dark with river , Bradruff 's image printed on him as though something had passed between them other than water . Puck motioned toward the soft leather folds of the back seat , and the old man got in , Puck crawling after him . He spoke a word into his tiny radio , the door closed , and the Cadillac swam up the levee like a glazed reptile . Mr. Dominic , everyone 's boss , was rocking back and forth in his mirrory shoes , staring after the car . Wayne cleared his throat . " Should n't that guy be in an ambulance or something ? " Mr. Dominic turned to him , and Wayne saw himself a tiny uniformed figure on the lenses of the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip . His boss smiled . " Somebody comes around , you know , like a newspaper man , " he said , " you send them to me , right ? " Wayne was young , but he was not stupid . " Right , " he said . His boss handed him a stick of spearmint gum and placed a hand on Wayne 's sodden shoulder . " Not to worry . We gon na get the gennleman the help he needs . " Mr. Joey came up behind the manager and gave his partner a look . Wayne peeled away the gum wrapper slowly . He popped the stick into his mouth and chewed vigorously , trying to keep from speaking . He watched Mr. Dominic turn and walk back to the imitation-wood office and concession area , toward his cloud-soft carpet and fragrant secretaries . Wayne went into the guardhouse and opened his locker to retrieve a dry uniform . In the tiny bathroom he closed his eyes and saw Bradruff 's streaming face coming up next to him in the river , wet and squalling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and stood in front of the window unit , his palms open to the vents . " I was checking on our man . " " You find out anything about why he jumped ? " " He wiped out around two in the morning . The shift manager , Nelson , that turd , came over and told him that maybe he should lay off and play another day . But Nelson never means it . They taught him to say that in casino school because it drives the bad gamblers nuts . Once the house suggests they should stay away from the machines , they 're crazy to get back . " Wayne stopped buttoning his shirt . " How did he keep playing when he busted out ? " " Puck says he drove up the hill to the all-night pawn and sold his watch , rings , and car . He had to walk back . " He made fists and rolled them in the cold air . " When he lost that , Nelson started to give him credit , and he really went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat and face whoever he was gon na have to explain the losses to . " Wayne shoved the corner of a towel into his ear . " These people we pull out of the river , they 're , like , weak to begin with , right ? " Mr. Joey shrugged . " I guess they 're accidents looking for a place to happen . " Wayne glanced over at the purple  --  and-turquoise trim work on the Something for Nothing . " This must be the place . " He pictured Bradruff again , how the color had returned to his face , the little broken vessels in his cheeks reddening like filaments . " He did n't look stupid . Why could n't he understand what was happening in there ? " Mr. Joey sat down on a wobbly turquoise stool . " Does a horsefly know what 's happening when it flies into a bug zapper ? " Wayne tried to imagine what goes on in a bug 's brain , the magic blue light , the mystical glow , the flawed trembling in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He contemplated the casino 's huge sign out by the highway that whirled its nimbus of bad-colored , magnetic neon . A month slid by like the chocolate-milk river , and two jumpers decided to stay among the living when they saw the silvery skiff and Wayne 's watchful eyes below them . The morning he hauled in a three-hundred-pound woman who had gambled away her trailer home , he began to feel powerful , like a real lifesaver , an angel of the skiff who would never let anyone come up limp and breathless . He began to enjoy coming to work . One August afternoon Puck patted the glass guardhouse door with his vast palm . " What 's going on ? " Wayne asked . " Hey , come inside and put on a white shirt and a badge . We 're short a man on the shift . " Puck had a habit of putting his right fist into his left hand and holding it in front of him . Wayne realized that his arms were too big to fold . Puck looked as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so big that his tie was short . " I did n't train for floor security . " Puck waved him out into the sun . " It 's just one shift . You do n't carry no gun or nothing . Just walk the slots and make sure the old ladies do n't go crazy . " Wayne boarded the boat , found the guards ' area , and drew his shirt , badge , and hat . Passing through a different door , he stepped out onto swirling orange , fuchsia , and teal carpet ; the room was a dinging , chime-wracked labyrinth of worst colors and hooting , winking slot machines , each one with a customer attached like a tick . The air itself was a fabric woven of bells , coins hammering into trays , the grind and flop of levers , the electric whanging of small payoffs . Wayne surveyed the room and understood that all of the motion and sound was orchestrated to rattle the customers toward a fear that some future allocation of bells would not be theirs , that a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big jackpot was coming soon , and they 'd be caught unprepared , a coin in the pocket instead of whirling through the innards of a benevolent machine . Interwoven with the noise was a fog of continually rebreathed cigarette smoke . He began his slow stroll through the deck , passing out of the forest of slot machines into an area lily  --  padded with blackjack tables surrounded by men wearing sunglasses shaped like jagged glass , middle  --  rollers with tumorous bouffants , and women , bleached or tinted , color  --  coded by age or wealth . Most of the players in the casino seemed the kind with no hope of ever getting their hands on a large amount of money . So they gambled against the house , the computerized house that hired geniuses to program the machines and to figure the odds on everything down to the last fate  --  lubricated turn of the roulette wheel . He looked around through the smoke and the racket , feeling like a conspirator in everyone 's losses . And then he saw him . Bald Mr. Bradruff was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a slot machine , a plastic bucket in the crook of his left arm . Wayne glanced toward the door that led to the outside deck , then back . He looked up at the ceiling camera in his quadrant and held out one finger . Stepping around a bank of bonging poker machines , he waited twenty seconds until Gagliano , the head of security for the floor , got the word through his earpiece and steered his round belly in Wayne 's direction . " What you got ? " Gagliano wore a jeweled badge and gold fringe on his cap . He was old , and he waddled when he walked , his hands facing backward . Wayne had heard that he 'd once been a master machinist . " The gentleman on number four , next row , is the guy who jumped . " Gagliano 's eyes were drooping from the smoke , and Wayne figured he was near the end of his shift . " Which guy who jumped off ? This month , January , last year , what ? " Wayne began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the boat , as though it were turning from its moorings . He wanted to ask how many jumpers there were in all . " It 's a Mr. Bradruff . " Gagliano walked around to the next aisle , spoke into his radio , waited a moment for an answer , and pretended to ignore Bradruff , who was steadily feeding his machine as if it were a beloved pet . Gagliano adjusted a wheel on his radio and held it close to his furry ear , then came back . " He 's all right . " " All right my ass . He tried to kill himself . " " Puck says he 's okay now . " He glanced over his shoulder . " He 's happy enough spending his quarters . " The guard shook his head . He had people to observe , money to count . " If you 're worried about him , just keep an eye on the door to the outside deck , " he said , chucking Wayne on the shoulder . Gagliano spoke a word into his radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next round , Wayne wandered close to Bradruff , noted the thin knit shirt he wore , then passed on through the pebble of little hard sounds paving the air , hoping he would n't be called on to slam into the water from up on this deck . After one turn around the floor , he drifted past Bradruff 's machine again , and this time the man 's eyes flicked up at him , sick and dark , and at the last instant before turning away they ignited with a fearful spark of recognition . Wayne touched him on a forearm lightly , and Bradruff leaned into the aisle , his hand stupidly caught in the bucket of coins . " How 's luck treating you ? " Wayne asked . Bradruff looked toward the door . " You the one pulled me out . " " That 's me . You all right now ? " He turned back to the machine . " You can mind your own business if you want to . I 'm just risking a few dollars here . " His eyes bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to do anything . " Wayne thought again of the wet feel of Bradruff in his arms . He took a step closer . " You here by yourself ? " " My son dropped me off on his motorbike . He 'll be picking me up before too long . " Wayne gave him a look . " You do n't have a car anymore ? " " I did n't have no car when I came into this world . " " Well , if you need something , I 'll be right up in here , walking around . " Bradruff put a hand up on a lever , his fingertips blackened by the coins . " I 'm all right with the management . They 're a bunch of nice guys . " " Yeah ? " " They got my house back . I mean , all the other stuff 's gone , but I have a roof . My wife and my son 's still living with me . " He dropped his hand into the bucket , fished a quarter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all without looking at the machine . " Everything 's fine . " Thirty quarters banged into the tray and Bradruff stared at them , deadpan . " See , things are looking up . " The night after he saw Bradruff , Wayne lay awake listening to his water heater knock and rumble . Toward dawn he began to imagine that if he ever had children , this is how it would be , worrying about what they were doing all the time . He went to work and spent the shift watching television and listening to the plastic speaker clipped to his shoulder like a fretting pet bird with a threatening beak . When he got off , he looked in the Baton Rouge directory , found Roy Bradruff 's address , and took a bus to a peeling frame house on a sandy lot south of Catfish Town . A yellow Monte Carlo with a large red sticker on the back windshield listed in a rain-topped rut . Wayne walked in off the street and knocked , and Bradruff came out onto the splintery porch in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream-colored paramecia swimming through a burgundy background . " Hey , " he said . Wayne saw that the shirt was not washed out at all but coated with fine sawdust . " I just wanted to check up on you . " Bradruff seemed sleepy or half drunk . He motioned feebly inside . " You want to sit awhile ? I just got off work at the cabinet shop . " " No . I feel kind of foolish worrying you like this . I just wanted to check on things . " Bradruff made a noise down in his chest , a cracking of phlegm . " You sure do n't owe me nothing . " " You do any good at the slots ? " Bradruff looked at him . " What you think ? " " You gon na keep coming to the boat ? " Wayne glanced over to a bloated yellow dog limping up onto the porch . " Only chance I got . " " Well , it 's a real long shot . " " Better than no shot . " Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocked back on his heels . " I 've heard the odds on the big one . Seven million to one is no shot . " Bradruff pulled his watch face around from the other side of his wrist and read the dial . " Somebody 's got to win it . " Any further comment would have sounded like an argument , so Wayne nodded and turned for the steps . " I just got off myself , so I 'll head on to the house . " " All right , " Bradruff said , sounding relieved . " Do n't set up worrying about me , now . I was pretty drunk that time I fell in the river . " Wayne bumped up against the dog , which walked backward and coughed . " Take it easy . " " Thanks for coming , " Bradruff told him , under his breath . Wayne watched him go inside . At least he was still alive , working and making money , still around for his family . Surely something had changed in him a bit-he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten days later , at four in the morning , Wayne and Mr. Joey were playing gin to keep awake when the little speakers on their shoulders began to scratch out a frantic " Four D " sung several times staccato , and together the men stumbled down the dark bank . The outboard dug into the river , the bow rising into the moonless sky . Immediately past the paddle wheel the skiff rode over a submerged drift log and the motor kicked up with a bang and stalled . Looking upriver alongside the boat , Wayne saw what he knew he would see . When he was a child he had waited at a rural railroad station with his mother to catch a cross-country train they both knew would be an hour late . He had stared at the empty distance between the rails patiently , knowing the void would fill , for the train was inevitable ; it was on tracks and had to come to town , and now Roy Bradruff was coming on , hanging to the casino rail , right on his schedule . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , moving one buttock , then the other , squinting in the hundreds of deck lights firing up this side of the boat . Wayne tried to figure the math of the rescue , what he would have to do if Bradruff made it to the water . The guards on deck were hanging back , their arms extended , waiting for a chance , but Bradruff was red-faced , unfocused and drunk , yelling in a backroad voice that all their son-of-a-bitching machines were broke , that he 'd poured his house back into the slots and was down to the clothes on his back . He ripped open his shirt , the buttons flying like shrapnel , and flung it off into the night . Then he tumbled bald head over heels . Mr. Joey had gotten the engine back into the water and started it ; the skiff surged upriver alongside the scummy hull , sliding under the falling man who came down on both of them with a percussion of bones and a squirted yell . The three men fell overboard , and Wayne began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the water around him darkened , he came up for air , heard the yells on deck , and glimpsed Mr. Joey stroking toward the casino . Wayne 's lifeguard instincts came alive , and he wanted Roy Bradruff like air itself . Spitting out a mouthful of silt-laced water , he yelled up at the boat , hoping that someone could point toward where he was supposed to swim in the murky chop , but everyone was busy pulling Mr. Joey out . Behind him he heard a man 's cry , like a boat whistle full of condensate , a watery scream that raised the hairs on his neck , and he struck out downriver into the black suck of current , past the end of the boat where the water faded from lit tan enamel to an oil-laced mystery on which reflections of shore lights sparked like drowning fireflies . He swam fifty yards along the darkening channel , seeing nothing , then stopping to tread water , to listen . Wayne hoped that Bradruff was not below him somewhere , trying to swim away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever he had done on the boat . He heard a swirl , like the struggle of a caught fish , and dug out toward it , clutching the water as though each stroke might touch a hand or an arm drifting away with a soul 's final motion . He swam until he imagined Bradruff 's body as a gray ember with only one spark at its center , but still something that could be blown back into fire . He swam until his arms went numb and a dark roller ironed him under . A charge of river stabbed up his nose , and , sputtering and lost in a new velvety blackness , he pic , tured his own limbs gray as ash and cooling toward death . The search over , his questing strength gone , he struggled toward the bank . All he could see was a dark wall ahead , and after many strokes he collided against the algae  --  padded side of a moored barge . Sapped and slipping south along its side he found a cable dangling between two barges and hung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving it over to the current like a flag to the breeze . He gathered black breaths , wondering if Bradruff had come up , or if he was journeying backward to his origins , a gamble lost , returned to the dealer . In only fifteen minutes a Coast Guard boat 's spotlight silver-plated the eddies , and he heard , from far off , a worried voice calling out for the two of them . The next afternoon he came back to work and was called to the cool green office of Mr. Dominic . Puck ushered him in to the smiling manager , who walked around his desk and motioned with both hands for Wayne to sit in a leather armchair . The skin on Mr. Dominic 's face was dry like the forest-green hide of the chair . " You thinking of quitting us , I hear . " " Yes sir . " Wayne felt himself sinking . " We moving some people around , you know . Thought you might want to get out of that little glass greenhouse and work the boat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wayne opened a hand , looked into the palm , then made a fist . " I was thinking of going back to factory work . Maybe find another truck plant and move . " Mr. Dominic looked at him . " The Shreveport plant is the closest one , and it 's closing down . You got to stay with us . " He made a gun of his hand and pointed it at Wayne . " Check the want ads . We the only game in town anymore , unless you want to get scalded down at Exxon or elected to the legislature . " Wayne twisted the soles of his shoes into the carpet . " I guess that 's true . What would I do on the boat ? " " A little security . You just wear a utility belt with cuffs and mace . Mr. Gagliano could train you in a couple days , teach you the radio codes , how to steer the drunks , how to watch a machine that 's being emptied . Usual stuff . Plus you 'd get an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands on a thigh , waiting for an answer like a man holding all the right cards . Wayne scanned the room for a window . He had the urge to look outside , but the room was like a plush , secret basement . " Okay , " he said . " Good . Good . " They both got to their feet , and Mr. Dominic put up a hand , clamping it on Wayne 's neck , shaking it affectionately . " You know , they found that poor man 's body this morning , down under a dock past the lower bridge . " Wayne 's mind cut off like an engine , and he waited in the quiet office for it to start up again . " Ah , " he said . " The funeral 's tomorrow afternoon . Just a wake type thing . You think you could show up ? You know , represent the boat to the family ? " He thought of himself in this changed identity , the representative of the Something for Nothing . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You could take the whole day off , " he whispered respectfully . " With overtime . " The funeral home was a long , low building of sickly white brick situated across from a refinery . Wayne 's cab pulled into the gravel parking lot , stopped , and he watched the dust ghosting down the curbless , potholed street . Inside , he signed the guest book and met the dead man 's wife , who was much larger than her husband . She wore long , swinging gray braids and leaned into Wayne , holding his hand and trying to bend it double . " We know you done what you could , " she said with her beery breath . He spilled out his rehearsed words . " All of us down at the casino are really sorry about this . " He had to speak up to be heard over a Hammond organ played in the vestibule by a stick of a woman . The tune was blurry , and the organist was bereft of rhythm . The wife 's eyes were hard to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all knew something was going to happen . " She looked off to the side . " You know it was n't an accident ? " She lifted her head . " Yeah , we ai n't that stupid . " " The boat , " he said , ducking his head , " it just does n't want any unhappy customers . " The woman 's eyes narrowed , as though she thought she might have been insulted . " Let me inerduce you to Roy Junior . " In the rear of the funeral-home chapel , against a wall of slightly buckled paneling , a slim , sun-eroded man who seemed to be forty years old leaned back in a chair , its front legs hovering off the carpet . Wayne reached out , and the redheaded son put his cigarette in the comer of his mouth and offered a hand that felt like tree root . The mother gave up a rattling cough and said , " This here 's the boy in the paper what tried to save him . " She turned and walked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He was wearing dark dress pants , patent-leather shoes left over from a wedding in the seventies , and a white dress shirt with silver collar tips . The top three buttons were undone , showing a gold chain with a Phillips 66 emblem on the end . " You almost got kilt , " Roy Junior said . Wayne sat next to him . " I tried to find him in the dark , but I could n't . " Roy Junior nodded . " Hey , you can back off on yourself half a turn . " He looked over at his mother . " The old man just did n't want to come on home to us . You know , he pawned my motorsickle to play them damn five-dollar slots is what he done . The pawnshop come got it last night . I worked four years to save enough for that thing , and do n't look at me like it was some hippie motorbike without no muffler . It was a Gold Wing , like a banker might ride with his wife on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips and drew deep , looking to the side at Wayne . " Daddy was okay all around , but he could n't leave them son-of-a  --  bitchin ' machines alone . My youngest brother had him a little college account started with money a uncle left him . Daddy lost that first thing on video poker . " He glanced up through his berry-bush eyebrows . " Aw , hell , I do n't mean to bend your ear with all our goins  --  on . " Wayne listened to the thready organ music and tried to imagine Roy Senior 's life but could n't . Finally , he asked , " What would he have done if he 'd won the big jackpot ? " Roy Junior bobbed his head . " Are you crazy , man ? Nobody ca n't win that . There 's billions to one odds on that thing . " " But what if he did ? " Roy Junior took a long , long drag on the nub of his cigarette , and Wayne thought the smoke must have been hot enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it back , what he took , " Roy Junior said , talking out the smoke . " But you ca n't do that . Once something is took , even if you get it back , it 's still been took from you . " The son straightened in his folding chair and flicked ash on the carpet . They both looked toward the tin  --  colored casket and Roy Bradruff 's waxy profile . " He was worth saving , " Wayne said . Roy Junior took another hissing drag , the tobacco burning out against the filter , and he looked at Wayne with derision and sympathy . " Maybe so , " he told him , " but the only one could have saved anything is in that box .
