When web surfers from the city of Shenzhen , in southern China , visit a government website , they are greeted by two adorable cartoon figures , a tiny policeman and policewoman with friendly smiles , no noses ( for some reason ) and huge melting blue anime eyes . These little rascals ' names are Jingjing and Chacha ( jingcha is Mandarin for police ) , and they are there to remind Web surfers to behave themselves because the Internet cops are always watching . <P> Westerners tend to think of the Web the way we think of the moon : it looks the same everywhere , and when you 're on it you can pretty much do whatever you want . But seen from China , the Web is very different . Beijing employs a force of 30,000 Internet censors 24/7 , blocking access to many sites expressing nonapproved opinions on hot-button issues like Taiwanese independence and the Falun Gong religious sect . When Western Web surfers search for images of " Tiananmen " on Google , they get row upon row of tanks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same search when you 're in China , and you get a snapshot of U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez and his wife posing in Tiananmen Square on a p.r . trip .
