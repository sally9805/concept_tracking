The halfpipe competition , with its music and its crowd interaction , could become the beach volleyball of the Winter Olympics . It 's a TV-friendly contest , and the U.S. should dominate . The halfpipe is a U-shaped channel carved in the snow in which riders do lip tricks and airs , including rotations , before landing . Amplitude , the height of each trick off the lip of the pipe , is key , as is style . <P> Every rider on the American team has a shot at the podium . Danny Kass , 19 , is a show in himself . He blends natural talent with technical style and a blatant disregard for Olympic trappings like coaching , training and discipline . " I 'm just here for the beer and babes , " Kass said after qualifying for the Games . Still , he may pick up some gold as well : Kass is one of the few riders who has pulled off a 1080 , or three revolutions , a move that will be a prerequisite for podium status . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together at least a 540 rotation , as well as one or more inverts , if they want a medal . Nagano bronze medalist Shannon Dunn-Downing , 29 , has been pushing the envelope with 720s and upside-down maneuvers . But Kelly Clark , 18 , is the future of women 's snow-boarding . The height and energy of her tricks are unparalleled , and with a clean run she is nearly unbeatable . <P> Organizers have spiced up the format of snowboarding 's other event , giant slalom , to be more fan-friendly . But the sport 's true believers sneer at this trick-free speed show  --  one reason the U.S. team wo n't be much of a factor . Europeans will dominate , as they do in speed-skiing events . <P>  --  By Jennifer Sherowski
