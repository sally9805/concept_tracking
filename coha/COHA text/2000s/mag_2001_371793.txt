The West has not fought a serious religious war in 350 years . America is too young to have fought any . Our first reaction , therefore , to the declaration of holy war made upon us on Sept. 11 was to be appalled , impressed and intimidated . Appalled by the primitivism , impressed by the implacability , intimidated by the fanaticism . <P> Intimidation was pervasive during the initial hand-wringing period . What have we done to inspire such rage ? What can we do ? Sure , we can strike back , but will that not just make the enemy even more angry and determined and fanatical ? How can you defeat an enemy who thinks he 's on a mission from God ? <P> How ? A hundred days and one war later , we know the answer : B-52s , for starters . <P> We were from the beginning a little too impressed . There were endless warnings that making war on a Muslim nation would succeed only in recruiting more enraged volunteers for bin Laden , with a flood of fierce mujahedin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned that the seething " Arab street " would rise up against us . <P> Look around . The Arab street is deathly quiet . The mobs , exultant on Sept. 11 and braying for American blood , have gone home . There are no recruits headed to Afghanistan to fight the infidel . The old recruits , battered and beaten and terrified , are desperately trying to sneak their way out of Afghanistan . <P> The reason is simple . We won . Crushingly . Astonishingly . Destroying a regime 7,000 miles away , landlocked and almost inaccessible , in nine weeks . <P> The logic of victory often eludes the secular West . We have a hard time figuring out an enemy who speaks in religious terms . He seems indestructible . Cut him down , and 10 more will rise in his place . How can you destroy an idea ? <P> This gave rise to the initial soul searching , the magazine covers plaintively asking WHY DO THEY HATE US ? The feeling that we might be responsible for the hatred directed against us suggested that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no assuaging those who see your very existence as a denial of the faith and an affront to God . There is no placating those who offer you the choice of conversion or death . <P> There is only war and victory . <P> Mullah Omar and bin Laden are animated by a vision . They really do believe  --  or perhaps did believe  --  that their destiny was to unite all the Muslim lands from the Pyrenees to the Philippines and re-establish the original caliphate of a millennium ago . Omar took the sacred robe , attributed to Muhammad and locked away for more than 60 years , and triumphantly donned it in public as if to declare his succession to the Prophet 's earthly rule . ( Osama harbored similar fantasies about himself , although he fed Omar 's , as a form of flattery and enticement . ) <P> Such visions are not new . Omar 's and Osama 's are just as expansive , just as eschatological , and yet no more crazy than Hitler 's dream of the Thousand-Year Reich or Napoleon 's of dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi Germany and revolutionary France , represent not just political parties or power seekers ; they also represent movements . And a movement carries with it an idea , an ideology , a vision for the future .
