Thursday , December 22nd Regan Reilly sighed for the hundredth time as she looked down at her mother , Nora , a brand-new patient in Manhattan 's Hospital for Special Surgery . " And to think I bought you that dopey crocheted rug you tripped on , " she said . " You only bought it . I caught my heel in it , " the well-known mystery writer said wanly . " It was n't your fault I was wearing those idiotic stilts . " Nora attempted to shift her body , which was anchored by a heavy plaster cast that reached from her toes to her thigh . " I 'll leave you two to assess the blame for the broken leg , " Luke Reilly , owner of three funeral homes , husband and father , observed as he hoisted his long , lean body from the low bedside armchair . " I 've got a funeral to go to , a dentist 's appointment , and then , since our Christmas plans are somewhat altered , I guess I 'd better see about buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . " Look at it this way : you may not be gazing at the Pacific Ocean , but you 've got a good view of the East River . " He and Nora and their only child , thirty-one-year-old Regan , had been planning to spend the Christmas holiday on Maui . " You 're a scream , " Nora told him . " Dare we hope you 'll arrive home with a tree that is n't your usual Charlie Brown special ? " " That 's not nice , " Luke protested . " But it 's true . " Nora dismissed the subject . " Luke , you look exhausted . Ca n't you skip Goodloe 's funeral ? Austin can take care of everything . " Austin Grady was Luke 's right-hand man . He had handled hundreds of funerals on his own , but the one today was different . The deceased , CuthbertBoniface Goodloe , had left the bulk of his estate to the **28;867;TOOLONG Society of the Garden State of New Jersey . His disgruntled nephew and partial namesake , Cuthbert Boniface Dingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meager inheritance . After viewing hours yesterday afternoon , C.B. had sneaked back to the casket where Luke had found him stuffing rotted bits of house plants in the sleeves of the pin-striped designer suit the fastidious Goodloe had chosen as his last outfit . As Luke came up behind C.B. , he heard him whispering , " You love plants ? I 'll give you plants , you senile old hypocrite . Get a whiff of these ! Enjoy them from now until Resurrection Day ! " Luke had backed away , not wanting to confront C.B. , who continued to vent verbal outrage at the body of his less-than-generous uncle . It was not the first time Luke had heard a mourner telling off the deceased , but the use of decaying foliage was a first . Later , Luke had quietly removed the offensive vegetation . But today , he wanted to keep an eye on C.B. himself . Besides , he had n't had a chance to mention the incident to Austin . Luke considered telling Nora about the nephew 's bizarre behavior , but then decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning his own funeral with me for three years , " he said instead . " If I did n't show up , he 'd haunt me . " " I suppose you should go . " Nora 's voice was sleepy , and her eyes were starting to close . " Regan , why do n't you let Dad drop you off at the apartment ? The last painkiller they gave me is knocking me out . " " I 'd rather hang around until your private nurse gets here , " Regan said . " I want to make sure someone is with you . " " All right . But then go to the apartment and crash . You know you never sleep on the red-eye flight . " Regan , a private investigator who lived in Los Angeles , had been packing for the trip to Hawaii when her father phoned . " Your mother 's fine , " he began . " But she 's had an accident . She broke her leg . " " She broke her leg ? " Regan had repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black tie at the Plaza . Mom was one of the honorees . She was running a little late . I rang for the elevator ... " One of Dad 's not very subtle ways of getting Mom to hurry up , Regan thought . " The elevator arrived , but she did n't . I went back into the apartment and found her lying on the floor with her leg at a very peculiar angle . But you know your mother . Her first question was to ask if her gown was torn . " That would be Mom , Regan had thought affectionately . " She was the best-dressed emergency-room patient in the history of the hospital , " Luke had concluded . Regan had dumped her Hawaii clothes out of the suitcase and replaced them with winter clothes suitable for New York . She barely made the last night flight from Los Angeles to Kennedy , and once in New York had paused only long enough to drop off her bags at her parents ' apartment on Central Park South . From the doorway of the hospital room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two women in his life , so alike in some ways with their classic features , blue eyes , and fair skin , but so different in others . From the Black Irish Reillys , Regan had inherited raven black hair , a throwback to the Spaniards who had settled in Ireland after their Armada had been destroyed in battle with the British . Nora , however , was a natural blonde , and at five feet three inches was four inches shorter than her daughter . At six feet five , Luke towered over both of them . His once-dark hair was now almost completely silver . " Regan , I 'll meet you back here at around seven , " he said . " After we cheer your mother up , we 'll go out and have a good dinner . " He caught Nora 's expression and smiled at her . " You thrive on the urge to kill , honey . All the reviewers say so . " He waved his hand . " See you girls tonight . " It was a commitment Luke would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16B at 211 Central Park South was in the process of being decorated for Christmas . " Deck the halls with boughs of holly , " Alvirah Meehan sang , off-key , as she placed a miniature wreath around the framed picture of Willy and herself accepting the $40 million lottery check that had changed their lives forever . The picture brought back vividly that magical evening three years ago , when she 'd been sitting in their tiny living room in Flushing , Queens , and Willy had been half asleep in his old club chair . She had been soaking her feet in a pail of warm water after a hard day of cleaning Mrs. O'Keefe 's house when Willy came home , really bushed , from repairing a burst pipe that had sent showers of rusty water on the newly pressed clothes at Spot-Free Dry Cleaners down the block . Then the announcer on television began to read the winning lottery numbers . I sure look different now , Alvirah thought , shaking her head as she examined the picture . The brassy red hair that for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been transformed by Madame Judith , to a soft golden red with subtle shadings . The purple polyester pants suit had long ago been banished by her classy friend , Baroness Min Von Schreiber . Of course , her jutting jaw was the same , a product of God 's design when he molded her , but she 'd gotten down from a size sixteen to a trimmer size fourteen . There was no question about it she looked ten years younger and a thousand times better now than in the old days . I was sixty then and looked like I was pushing seventy . Now I 'm sixty-three and do n't look a day over fifty-nine , she told herself happily . On the other hand , she decided , looking at the picture , even dressed in that bargain-basement blue suit and skinny little tie , Willy managed to look handsome and distinguished . With his shock of white hair and vivid blue eyes , Willy always reminded people of the late , legendary Speaker of the House of Representatives , Tip O'Neill . Poor Willy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten . Nobody should be stuck with a toothache during the Christmas season . But Dr. Jay will fix him up . Our big mistake was to get involved with that other guy when Dr. Jay moved to New Jersey , Alvirah thought . He talked Willy into getting a dental implant even though it had n't worked last time , and it 's been killing him . Oh , well , it could be worse , she reminded herself . Look what happened to Nora Regan Reilly . She had heard on the radio that the suspense author , who happened to be her favorite writer , had broken her leg the evening before in her apartment in the very next building . Her high heel had caught in the fringe of a rug , Alvirah mused the same kind of thing that happened to Grandma . But Grandma was n't wearing high heels . She had stepped on a wad of bubble gum in the street , and when the fringe of the rug stuck to the bottom of her orthopedic sneakers , she went sprawling . " Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bedroom . The right side of his face was swollen , and his expression was instant testimony to the fact that the troublesome implant was still killing him . Alvirah knew how to cheer him up . " Willy , you know what makes me feel good ? " " Whatever it is , share it right away . " " It 's knowing that Dr. Jay will get rid of that implant , and by tonight you 'll be feeling much better . I mean , are n't you better off than poor Nora Regan Reilly , who 'll be hobbling around on crutches for weeks ? " Willy shook his head and managed a smile . " Alvirah , can I never have an ache or a pain without you telling me how lucky I am ? If I came down with the bubonic plague , you 'd try to make me feel sorry for somebody else . " Alvirah laughed . " I suppose I would at that , " she agreed . " When you ordered the car , did you allow for holiday traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dentist appointment , but today I am . " " Of course I did , " she assured him . " We 'll be there long before three . Dr. Jay squeezed you in before he sees his last patient . He 's closing early for the holiday weekend . " Willy looked at his watch . " It 's only a little after ten . I wish he could see me this minute . What time is the car coming ? " " One-thirty . " " I 'll start to get ready . " With a sympathetic shake of her head , Alvirah watched her husband of forty-three years disappear back into the bedroom . He 'll be feeling a thousand percent better tonight , she decided . I 'll make some nice vegetable soup for dinner , and we 'll watch the tape of It 's a Wonderful Life . I 'm glad we delayed our cruise until February . It will be good to have a quiet , at-home Christmas this year . Alvirah looked around the room and sniffed appreciatively . I love the smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous . They had placed it right in the center of the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park . The branches were laden with the ornaments they 'd accumulated over the years , some handsome , some battered , all cherished . Alvirah pushed back her large , round glasses , walked over to the cocktail table , and grabbed the last unopened box of tinsel . " You never can have too much tinsel on the tree , " she said aloud . Three more days until Christmas , twenty-six-year-old Rosita Gonzalez thought , as she waited for Luke Reilly behind the wheel of one of the Reilly Funeral Home limos , standing near the hospital 's Seventy-first Street entrance . Mentally she reviewed the presents she had bought for her five- and six-year-old sons , Bobby and Chris . I have n't forgotten anything , she assured herself . She so wanted them to have a good Christmas . So much had changed in the last year and a half . Their father had left not that that was any loss and her ailing mother had moved back to Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were afraid she would somehow disappear too . My little guys , she thought with a rush of tenderness . Together , the three of them had picked out their Christmas tree last night and would decorate it tonight . She had the next three days off , and Mr. Reilly had given her a generous Christmas bonus . Rosita looked in the rearview mirror and straightened the driver 's cap over her waterfall of dark curly hair . It sure was a stroke of luck when I got the job at the funeral home , she thought . She had started working part-time in the office , but when Luke learned that she moonlighted as a limo driver , he told her , " You can have all the extra work you want here , Rosita . " Now she frequently drove for funerals . There was a tap on the driver 's window . Rosita looked up , expecting to see the face of her good-natured boss . Instead she found herself locking eyes with a vaguely familiar countenance , which , for the moment , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was rewarded with a belch of cigarette smoke . His head darting forward , her unexpected visitor identified himself in staccato tones : " Hi , Rosie , I 'm Petey the Painter . Remember me ? " How could I forget ? Rosita wondered . A mental image of the brilliant chartreuse shade he 'd painted the main viewing room of the Reilly funeral home in Summit , New Jersey , flashed through her mind . She remembered Luke Reilly 's reaction when he saw it . " Rosita , " Luke had said , " I do n't know whether to laugh , cry , or throw up . " " I 'd throw up , Mr. Reilly , " had been Rosita 's advice . Needless to say , Petey the Painter 's services had no longer been requested nor required in any of the three Reilly funeral homes . Petey had gratuitously added bright yellow to the moss-green paint Luke had selected , declaring that he thought the place needed a little livening . " Relatives of dead people need cheering up , " he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a little extra yellow paint in my car , so I threw it in for free . " On his way out , he 'd asked Rosita for a date , which she 'd promptly declined . Rosita wondered if he still had flecks of paint in his hair . She looked at him , but could n't tell . A cap with earmuffs covered every inch of his head and shaded his narrow , bony face . His wiry frame was encased in a dark-blue storm jacket . The turned-up collar of the jacket grazed the graying stubble that shaded his chin . " Of course I remember you , Petey , " she said . " What are you doing here ? " He shuffled from foot to foot . " You look great , Rosie . Too bad your most important passengers never get to feast their eyes on you . " The reference , of course , was to the fact that Rosita sometimes drove the hearse in funeral cortges . " You 're funny , Petey . See you . " She began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hey , it 's freezing out . Can I sit in the car ? I need to ask you something . " " Petey , Mr. Reilly will be here any minute . " " This will only take a minute , " he explained . Reluctantly , Rosita threw the lock that opened all the doors . She had expected him to go around and get in beside her in the front seat . Instead , in a lightning-fast motion , he opened the back door of the vehicle and slid in . Thoroughly annoyed with her intruder , she swiveled her head around to face him in the back of the limo , whose tinted windows shielded anyone seated there from the view of the outside world . What she saw took her breath away . For a moment she thought it was a joke . Surely that could n't be a gun Petey was holding ? " Nobody 's going to get hurt if you do what I tell you , " Petey said soothingly . " Just keep a nice , calm look on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A weary and preoccupied Luke Reilly emerged from the elevator and walked the short distance to the door of the hospital , barely noticing the Christmas decorations adorning the lobby . He stepped outside into the raw , cloudy morning and was glad to see his limo waiting near the end of the driveway . In a few strides , Luke 's long legs brought him to the car . He knocked on the window of the passenger side , and a moment later was turning the handle of the back door . He was inside and had closed the door behind him before he realized that he was not alone in the backseat . Luke 's unerring memory for faces , coupled with the sight of paint-flecked boots , made him realize instantly that the man sitting opposite him with the gun in his hand was none other than the idiot who had turned his viewing room into a psychedelic nightmare . " In case you do n't remember me , I 'm Petey the Painter . I worked for you last summer . " Petey raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered . " Turn right at the corner and pull over . We 're making a pickup . " " I remember you , " Luke said quietly . " But I prefer seeing you with a paintbrush instead of a gun . What 's this all about ? " " My friend will explain when he gets in . Nice comfortable car you got here . " Again , Petey raised his voice . " Rosie , do n't try any funny stuff like running a light . We do n't want no attention from the cops . " Luke had barely slept the night before , and his mind was blurry . Now he felt somehow detached from reality , as though he were dreaming or half asleep , watching a movie . He was alert enough , however , to sense that this unlikely kidnapper might never have held a gun before , which actually made him twice as dangerous . Luke knew he could not take the chance of throwing himself forward in an attempt to overpower his captor . Rosie turned the corner . The car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another man joined them . Luke 's mouth dropped : Petey the Painter 's partner in crime was none other than C. B. Dingle , the disgruntled nephew of the late Cuthbert Boniface Goodloe . Like Petey , C.B. was wearing a cap with earmuffs that fit loosely over his balding head , and a bulky , nondescript storm jacket that covered his butterball-shaped torso . C.B. 's round , pale face was half covered by a dark , bushy mustache that had not been present at his uncle 's wake the day before . Wincing , he pulled off the fuzzy disguise and addressed Luke . " Thank you for being on time , " he said cordially as he patted his lip . " I do n't want to be late for my uncle 's funeral . But I 'm afraid you 're not going to make it , Mr. Reilly . " Where are they taking us ? Rosita agonized as , following C.B. 's instructions , she turned right on Ninety-sixth Street and headed for the FDR Drive north . She had seen C.B. at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times before when he came to the funeral home with his uncle , who kept changing his mind about the plans for his last farewell . Irrationally , she almost smiled , remembering that Cuthbert Boniface Goodloe had stopped in only last month to inform Luke that the restaurant he had chosen for a reception after his funeral had been closed down by the Health Department . She had driven Mr. Reilly , Goodloe , and C.B. to the Orchard Hill Inn , which Mr. Reilly had suggested as a replacement . Mr. Reilly told her later that Goodloe had painstakingly studied the menu , eliminating the most expensive items from his guests ' future selections . That day C.B. , as usual , had been practically kissing his uncle 's butt , which obviously had done him no good . Yesterday afternoon the viewing room had been filled with shocked but grateful members of the **28;897;TOOLONG Society of the Garden State of New Jersey a group commonly known as the Blossoms whose goal to spruce up every nook and cranny of New Jersey had just received a much needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodloe 's dying words to his nephew had been , " Get a job ! " Had C.B. gone crazy ? Was he dangerous ? And what does he want with me and Mr. Reilly ? Rosita wondered as , even inside her gloves , her fingers turned to ice . " Head for the George Washington Bridge , " C.B. ordered . At least they were going back to New Jersey , Rosita thought . She wondered if there was any hope of appealing to C.B. to let them go . " Mr. Dingle , you may know I have two little boys who need me , " she said softly . " They 're five and six years old , and their father has n't supported or seen them in over a year . " " My father was a crumb too , " C.B. snapped . " And do n't call me Mr. Dingle . I hate that name . " Petey had overheard . " It 's a dumb name , " he agreed . " But your first and middle names are even worse . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.B. 's mom saddled him with a name like Cuthbert Boniface , in honor of her sister 's husband . And then , when the old geezer passes away , he gives just about everything to the stupid Blossoms ? Maybe they 'll name a new strain of poison ivy after him . " " I spent my whole life pretending to like those stupid names ! " C.B. said angrily . " And what do I get for it ? Career advice three seconds before he croaks . " " I 'm sorry about all that , C.B. , " Luke said firmly . " But your problems have nothing to do with us . Why are we here , or more precisely , why are you and Petey in my car ? " " I beg to differ " C.B. began . Petey interrupted : " I really like that expression . It sounds so classy . " " Shut up , Petey , " C.B. snapped . " My problem has everything to do with you , Mr. Reilly . But your wife is going to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway across the George Washington Bridge . " Petey , you tell Rosie where to turn . You know the way better than I do . " " Take the Fort Lee exit , " Petey began . " We 're going south . " Fifteen minutes later , the car pulled onto a narrow road that led down to the Hudson River . Rosita was on the verge of tears . They reached an empty parking area at the river 's edge , facing the skyline of Manhattan . To the left they could see the towering gray span of the George Washington Bridge . The heavy stream of holiday traffic crossing back and forth on its two levels only increased Rosita 's sense of isolation . She had a sudden terrible fear that C.B. and Petey might be planning to shoot them and throw their bodies into the river . " Get out of the car , " C.B. ordered . " Remember we both have guns and know how to use them . " Petey aimed his revolver at Luke 's head as he and Rosita reluctantly left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick twirl . " I watched reruns of The Rifleman doing this , " he explained . " I 'm getting real good at twirling . " Luke shuddered . " I 'll be your escort , " C.B. told him . " We have to hurry . I have a funeral to make . " They were forced to walk along the shore , past a deserted marina , to where a dilapidated houseboat , its windows boarded up , was anchored at the end of a narrow dock . The boat rocked up and down , as the river lapped restlessly against its sides . It was obvious to Luke that the worn and aging craft was sitting dangerously low in the water . " Take a look at the ice that 's starting to form out there . You ca n't be planning to put us on that thing in this weather , " Luke protested . " In summertime it 's real nice , " Petey boasted . " I take care of it for the guy who owns it . He 's in Arizona for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is n't July , " Luke snapped . " Sometimes you get bad weather in July too , " Petey responded . " One time there was a real bad storm , and " " Shut up , Petey , " C.B. growled irritably . " I told you , you talk too much . " " You would too if you painted rooms all by yourself twelve hours a day . When I 'm with people , I like to talk . " C.B. shook his head . " He drives me nuts , " he said under his breath . " Now be careful getting onto the boat , " he told Rosita . " I do n't want you to slip . " " You ca n't do this to us . I 've got to go home to my boys , " Rosita cried . Luke could hear the note of hysteria in Rosita 's voice . The poor kid is scared stiff , he thought . Just a few years younger than Regan and supporting two children on her own . " Help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grasp Rosita 's arm as , fearfully , she stepped down onto the deck of the swaying vessel . " You 're very good at influencing people , Mr. Reilly , " C.B. complimented . " Let 's hope you 're as successful for the next twenty-four hours . " Petey unlocked the door of the cabin and pushed it open , releasing a dank , musty smell into the cold outside air . " Whew , " Petey said . " That stink 'll get you every time . " " Move it , Petey , " C.B. ordered . " I told you to get an Airwick . " " How thoughtful , " Rosita said sarcastically as she followed Petey inside . Luke glanced over at the Manhattan skyline , then looked upriver to the George Washington Bridge , taking in the little red lighthouse underneath . I wonder if I 'll ever get the chance to see all this again , he thought , as C.B. pressed the gun in the small of his back . " Inside , Mr. Reilly . This is n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead light as C.B. closed the door behind them . On one side of the small , shabby space was a seating area consisting of a Formica dinette table surrounded by a cracked , imitation-leather banquette ; directly opposite was a matching couch . The furniture was all built-in units . A small refrigerator , sink , and stove were adjacent to the table . Luke knew that the two doors to the left probably led to a bedroom and whatever passed for a bathroom . " Oh , no , " Rosita gasped . Luke followed her stare , and with dismay realized that two sets of chains were bolted to the walls in the seating area . They were the kind of hand and ankle restraints commonly used to restrain criminal defendants in courtrooms . One set was next to the couch , the other near the banquette . " You sit here , " Petey directed Rosita . " Keep me covered , C.B. , while I put her bracelets on . " " I got everybody covered , " C.B said emphatically . " You 're over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd take my chances and try to grab his gun , Luke thought angrily , but I ca n't risk Rosita 's life . An instant later , he was sitting on the banquette , chained , with Rosita opposite him on the couch . " I should have asked if either one of you cares to use the facilities , but now you 'll just have to wait , " C.B. said cheerfully . " I do n't want to be late for my uncle 's funeral . After all , I am the chief mourner . And Petey needs to get rid of your car . When we come back , Petey 'll bring stuff for your lunch . I wo n't be hungry , though . My uncle paid for my meal today , remember , Mr. Reilly ? " C.B. opened the door as Petey turned out the light . An instant later the door slammed shut , and Luke and Rosita could hear the grating of the key turning in the rusty lock . Trapped in the shadowy darkness of the swaying boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their precarious situation hit both of them . Then Rosita asked quietly , " Mr. Reilly , what 's going to happen to us ? " Luke chose his words carefully . " They 've already told us they 're looking for money . Assuming that 's all they really want , I promise it will be paid . " " All I can think about is my kids . My regular baby-sitter is away until next week , and I do n't trust the girl who 's filling in . Her Christmas dance is tonight . She did n't want to work at all today , but I begged her to . She expects me home by three . " " She would n't leave the boys alone . " " You do n't know her , Mr. Reilly she wo n't miss that dance , " Rosita said with certainty , a catch in her voice . " I 've got to get home . I 've just got to get home . " Regan opened her eyes , groggily sat up , swung her legs over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her parents ' apartment on Central Park South was as comfortably familiar as the one in the family home in New Jersey in which she 'd been raised . Today , though , she did not take time to appreciate the charming ambience of the peach-and-soft-green color scheme . She had the sensation of having slept a long time , but when she looked at the clock , she was glad to see it was only a few minutes before two . She wanted to phone the hospital and see how her mother was doing , then catch up with her father . She realized that beyond the fact that she was feeling the effects of the news about her mother 's accident and the hurried red-eye flight , she was filled with undefined anxiety . A quick shower might help me clear my mind , she thought , and then I 'll get moving . She put in a call to La Parisienne , the local coffee shop , and placed her usual breakfast order : orange juice , coffee , and a toasted bagel with cream cheese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . By the time I get out of the shower , the delivery boy will be ringing the bell . The strong spray of hot water felt good on her back and shoulders . She quickly washed her hair , stepped out of the shower , wrapped herself in a robe , and rolled a towel around her head . Ten seconds later , her face glistening with moisturizer , she answered the door for the delivery boy . She was glad he pretended not to notice her appearance . In his job , he 's seen it all , she thought . But he did produce a sunny smile when she gave him a generous tip . Moments later , the bagel unwrapped , the coffee cup in her hand , she phoned her mother 's room . She knew the nurse had to be there , but no one picked up . The ringer is probably turned off , she thought . She hung up and dialed the nurses ' station on that floor . What seemed like several minutes passed as she waited for her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief to hear the friendly , professional , and reassuring voice of Beverly Carter . She had come on duty this morning , just as Regan was leaving . Although they had spoken only briefly , Regan had instantly liked the slim , fortyish black woman , whom the doctor had introduced as one of their finest private nurses . " Hi , Beverly . How 's my mother ? " " She 's been sleeping since you left . " " I 've been sleeping since I left , " Regan laughed . " When she wakes up , tell her I called . Have you heard from my father ? " " Not so far . " " I 'm surprised . But he did have that funeral . I 'll give him a call . Tell my mother she can always reach me on my cell phone . " Next , Regan dialed the funeral home . Austin Grady , the second in command at " Reilly 's Remains , " as Regan and her mother dubbed the funeral homes , answered . His initial greeting , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Regan . " The somber tone turned jolly . " Regan , hello . " Regan was always amazed at the way Austin could switch gears so rapidly , his demeanor of the moment dictated by the demands of his job . As Luke had observed , he was perfectly suited to this line of work . Like a surgeon , he was able to disassociate himself from surrounding emotions . " Is my father there ? " she asked . " No , I have n't spoken to him since he called early this morning to send for a car . Your poor mother , " he commiserated in a most upbeat tone . " What 's going to happen next ? And I know your father was really looking forward to the trip to Hawaii . I understand she tripped on a new rug you bought her in Ireland . " " Yes , " Regan said quickly , guilt about her purchase washing over her again . As her best friend , Kit , always said , " Guilt is the gift that keeps on giving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be there for a funeral you were having today . Did n't he show up at all ? " " Well , no , but the service went beautifully . The old guy had been planning it for years . Your father probably realized he did n't really need to come . " Austin chuckled . " Right now the mourners are all enjoying a free lunch across town . The deceased left the bulk of his estate to the Blossoms . They 're all at the restaurant , and they look like one happy group . They inherited enough money to buy sprinkling cans for every plant in the state of New Jersey . " " Lucky them , " Regan said . " Your father has a 3:30 dentist 's appointment on his schedule . I do n't think he 'll miss that . " " Thanks , Austin . " Regan hung up and dialed Luke 's cell phone . After several rings his voice mail came on . As she listened to her father 's voice telling the caller to leave a message , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been heard from in hours , even to inquire about her mother . She left a message for him to call her . She sipped her coffee and thought for a minute . I ca n't just sit here , she decided . She glanced at the clock . It was now 2:35 . She called the dentist 's office to confirm that her father had not canceled his appointment . " Please ask him to wait for me , " Regan said to the receptionist . " I 'm leaving the city in a few minutes , and it should n't take me more than an hour to get there . " " Will do , " the receptionist promised . Regan hurriedly dressed and dried her hair . After Dad has his appointment , we can do the errands together , she thought . Then we 'll drive back to the city to see Mom . But even as she pulled on her coat and ran down to grab a cab , Regan somehow knew that that was n't what she would be doing this afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark , chilly houseboat ? Luke had no sense of time . It seemed like hours . They could have left the light on , he thought angrily . After C.B. and Petey the Painter took off , Luke had tried to reassure Rosita . " Trust my hunch , " he told her . " When those jerks come back , they 'll tell us what they want . And when they get it , they 'll let us go . " " But we can identify them , Mr. Reilly . Do you really think they can be that stupid ? " " Rosita , probably nobody else could be that stupid , but I believe it of that pair . It wo n't be long before we 're missed . Do n't forget , my daughter 's a private investigator , and she 'll have everyone looking for us . " " Just as long as someone takes care of my kids . I 'm so afraid that ditzy baby-sitter will dump them with someone they do n't know . My little guy , especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I 'm sure of , it 's that when Regan realizes we 're missing , she 'll check on your kids . " They had n't spoken for a while . It was only about ten feet across the cabin to the built-in couch where Rosita was chained . Had she dozed off ? Luke wondered . The lapping of the water against the sides of the boat made it impossible to hear any sound of movement from her . " Rosita , " he said softly . Before she could answer , a thud on the deck startled both of them . The sound of the key grating in the lock dispelled Luke 's hope that whoever was outside might be a potential rescuer . The door opened . A somber trickle of light and a blast of cold air preceded Petey and C.B. into the cabin . " How are our campers doing ? " C.B. asked jovially as Petey snapped on the overhead light . " I hope you 're not vegetarians . We bought ham and cheese sandwiches . " Both men were carrying grocery bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small the bags were . Either they were planning to have them out of here in a short time , or there would be frequent take-outs from the local fast-food outlets in Edgewater . " Either one of you want to go to the can ? " Petey asked solicitously . Luke and Rosita both nodded . " Ladies first , " Petey said . He released Rosita 's hand and ankle shackles . " You can close the door , but do n't get any stupid ideas . Besides , it do n't have a window . " Rosita looked at Luke . " Could you lend me a dollar for the attendant ? " When it was Luke 's turn inside the tiny cubicle , he considered his options and realized he had none . Even if he could overpower Petey when he was refastening the chains , C.B. would be standing with his gun trained on Rosita . I have to play along with them , he thought . While Luke , Rosita , and Petey ate their sandwiches , C.B. sipped coffee . " I 'm full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That restaurant you suggested was n't bad . The veal parmigiana was the best I 've had in ages . Although I 'm surprised I could digest my meal , having to look at those nerds from the Blossom Society . It was only the thought of you two back here that got me through . " " You could have brought me back some veal parmigiana , " Petey griped . " I think this rye bread is a little stale . And he did n't put enough mayo on mine . " He peered over at Luke 's sandwich . " Let 's switch halves . " Luke grabbed the second half of his sandwich and took a big bite out of it . He laid it back down on the wax paper . " Be my guest . " Luke was inordinately pleased to see the disappointed look on Petey 's face . Petey looked at Rosita . " No dessert for the boss . You can have his Twinkies . " " I 'd rather choke , " Rosita snapped . " Now that we 're one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " C.B. crushed his empty coffee cup and stuffed it into the deli bag . " Be careful , the pickles are still in there , " Petey protested . C.B. groaned and dumped the contents of the bag on the scarred Formica table . " Do n't get mad , " Petey said . " I was n't at some fancy lunch . I feel like I 've been on a bus all day . Once I dumped the car at Kennedy , I had to take a bus to the Port Authority . Then I hadda wait for another bus to Edgewater . Then I hadda wait for you at the bus stop . You were too cheap to let me take a cab . You 've been riding in a nice warm car all day " " Shut up ! " But Petey was n't finished . " I had my four dollars ready to pay when I crossed the George Washington Bridge . Then when I 'm waiting in a long line to hand it over , I discover there 's an E-Z Pass on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the windshield and switched lanes fast . Some jerk almost plowed into me . He starts honking his horn like a crazy person . Then I saved you more money when I went over the Triborough Bridge . You should have noticed that E-Z Pass when you rode up front . I 'm surprised at you . " C.B. 's eyes bulged . " You used the E-Z Pass ? You moron ! I took it off so they would n't be able to track us . Now they can check and find out where it 's been used . " " Really ? " Petey looked awestruck . " I 'll be darned . What will they think of next ? " He turned to Luke and Rosita . " C.B. is so smart . He reads a lot of detective novels . I never had much chance to read . Mr. Reilly , I know he really likes your wife 's novels . I think one of them is even autographed . " " When you release us , I 'll get him another one . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pickle . " Explain our plan , C.B. It 's so good . In a few days we 're going to be on a beach somewhere with a million dollars in our suitcase . " C.B. interrupted Petey . " I 'm telling you for the last time , Petey . Keep your mouth shut ! " He pulled Luke 's and Rosita 's cell phones from the leather pouch where he had stashed them . " Mr. Reilly , it 's nearly 4:30 . We 're going to get in touch with your family and tell them we want a million dollars cash by tomorrow afternoon . " Rosita gasped . " A million dollars ? " Petey piped in . " He 's got viewing rooms all over New Jersey , and his wife sells a lot of books . Hey , C.B. , maybe we should ask for more . " C.B. ignored him . " I can guarantee my family will pay you the money , " Luke said carefully . " But it 's Thursday afternoon of Christmas weekend . I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Believe me , they can , " C.B. said . " If they want to . " " He read it in a book , " Petey volunteered . " Banks do things for important people , like opening their doors at all hours . And you 're a real important person . " " But my wife is in the hospital , " Luke protested . " We know that . Where do you think we picked you up ? " C.B. asked . " Now who do you want us to call ? " " My daughter . She just got in from California . She 'll get you the money . " He gave them her cell phone number : " 310-555-4237 . " Petey started scribbling the number on a piece of paper he had torn off the brown deli bag . " Say that again " Luke repeated the number slowly . C.B. turned the phone on and began dialing . " That implant came out smooth as silk , " Dr. Jay assured Alvirah . " I have Willy on oxygen now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take him home . He 's still groggy . " " That laughing gas really knocks Willy out , " Alvirah commented . " But he sure was looking forward to it . He 's been in such misery . " " Well , give him a couple of days , and he 'll be good as new . The prescription for antibiotics should clear up his infection . " Dr. Jay 's pleasant , bespectacled face broke into a smile . " He 'll be able to enjoy the Christmas holiday . I know I 'm looking forward to it . " He looked at his watch . " I have one more patient , and then I 'm on vacation . " " Any big plans ? " Alvirah queried with her usual genuine interest in the comings and goings of her fellow creatures . " My wife and I are taking the kids skiing in Vermont . " " Nice , " Alvirah said , shaking her head . " When we won the lottery , I made a list of all the things I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . But I have n't gotten around to it yet . " She did not miss the alarmed expression on Dr. Jay 's face . " I bet you think I could n't do it , " she challenged . " Alvirah , I 've known you long enough . Nothing you do would surprise me . " Alvirah laughed . " Do n't worry . I wo n't crash into you on the slopes just yet . If the weather reports are right about a storm , you should have some great skiing . " " If it does hit , we 'll already be there . We 're leaving tonight . " Dr. Jay looked at the door . " He 's never late , " he murmured more to himself than to Alvirah , then said , " I 'll check on Willy and start to wrap things up around here . " As the doctor left the waiting room , Alvirah admitted to herself that she really had been worried about Willy more worried than she had allowed herself to realize . Willy has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even let myself consider that something could be seriously wrong with him . She was so deep in thought that the ringing of the office bell startled her . That must be the patient Dr. Jay is waiting for , she reasoned . She jumped up to answer the door as a buzzer released the lock . Alvirah immediately knew that the slender , dark-haired young woman who came into the waiting room was not the patient Dr. Jay was expecting . She had clearly heard him say that " he " was never late . She quickly sized up the newcomer around thirty , very attractive , wearing a handsome suede jacket , jeans , and boots ; obviously preoccupied . She smiled fleetingly at Alvirah as she looked at the empty reception desk . " Everybody except Dr. Jay has gone home already , " Alvirah volunteered cheerily . " He 's waiting for his last patient . " Alvirah could see that the look of concern on the young woman 's face immediately deepened . Dr. Jay appeared at the doorway . " Hi , Regan . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I was hoping to hook up with him here , " Regan said . " Well , he should be along any minute . I expected him half an hour ago . " " It 's so unlike my father to be late . " " There 's a lot of traffic out there , " Dr. Jay said with a wave of his hand . The expression on Regan 's face , however , remained clearly troubled . " Is anything wrong ? " he asked her . Regan walked closer to the doctor and lowered her voice , a useless exercise , since Alvirah Meehan could hear a mouse sneeze from three rooms away . " It 's been kind of crazy , " she began , and briefly explained about her mother 's accident . That 's who she is ! Alvirah thought : Nora Regan Reilly 's daughter . Of course ! I thought she looked familiar . She 's a private investigator , just like me . Only she has a license . Alvirah sat up straight and cocked her head , praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought I 'd help my father do some shopping this afternoon after he saw you , " Regan was saying . " Because we were planning to go to Hawaii , we do n't have a Christmas tree or any food in the house . " I love Hawaii , Alvirah thought . " What worries me , " Regan continued , " is that I ca n't reach my father on his cell phone , and he has n't called my mother since he left her room at the hospital this morning . And now he is n't here . None of this is like him . " Her voice was forlorn . Uh-oh , Alvirah thought . She 's right . Something 's wrong . " Well , let 's wait and see , " Dr. Jay said reassuringly . " He 'll probably be here any minute . If he is n't , with all that happened today , it must mean that he simply forgot . He 's obviously got a lot on his mind . I 'm sure there 's a logical explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be ready to go in about fifteen minutes . " " Take your time , " Alvirah said , grateful that Willy was n't ready yet to walk out the door . She watched as Regan restlessly crossed to the window , looked out at the parking area , then sat in the straight-backed chair opposite the couch . After a moment , Alvirah leaned forward . " I just want you to know that I 've read every one of your mother 's books and I love them . I was so sorry to hear about her accident . I can see you 're worried about your father , but take my word , when something happens to a wife , husbands are useless . They forget everything . " Regan smiled slightly . " I hope you 're right . I 'm going to try calling him again . " She pulled out her cell phone and dialed . " No answer , " she said . " I 'll try the hospital . " Let him be there or have called , Alvirah prayed as Regan spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . " My mother is still asleep , which is good . My father has n't called , which is n't . " She stood up and once again walked to the window . Alvirah wanted to say something comforting , but she knew there was nothing to be said . Had something happened to Luke Reilly ? Nearly twenty minutes later he was still not there . " Okay , Alvirah , you can collect your patient , " Dr. Jay said as he came down the hall , his hand under Willy 's arm . " Hi , honey , " Willy said feebly . " Take him home and let him sleep it off , " Dr. Jay instructed . " And have a great holiday . " He turned to Regan : " Any word ? " " Dr. Jay , I think it 's obvious my father is n't going to make it today . I 'll call a cab to take me to the house . I 'm sure I 'll catch up with him there . " " Do n't you live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for an answer . " I know you do . It says so on the book jackets . We 've got a car and driver outside . We 'll drop you home . Come on , Willy . " Before she could protest , Regan found herself sitting next to Alvirah in the backseat of a sleek , black limo . Willy , his legs stretched out , his eyes shut , was leaning back on the opposite seat . " I 've taken driving lessons three times in the last three years , " Alvirah explained . " The instructors always found excuses to pass me off on someone else . " She laughed . " I ca n't blame them . You would n't believe all the parking cones I 've flattened . " Regan smiled . She instinctively liked Alvirah and realized now that she had heard her name somewhere before . As the car pulled onto the main road , she said , " I feel as though I know you from somewhere . Your name is familiar . " Alvirah beamed . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could say I 'm kind of in your business . I 've accidentally been around when the police needed help . Then I 've written about what happened for the Globe . I 'm what you might call ' a roving crime correspondent . ' " " Roving is n't the word , " Willy volunteered , without opening his eyes . " Alvirah 's always at full throttle , looking for trouble . " Regan laughed . " My mother sent me a couple of your columns . She enjoyed them and thought I 'd be interested in the cases . She was right . " Alvirah 's coat was open . Regan leaned over . " Is that your famous pin with the hidden microphone ? " " I never leave home without it , " Alvirah said proudly . Regan reached into her pocket . " I 'm going to try my father 's office . " But there was nothing new : Austin Grady still had n't heard from Luke . With a sigh , Regan clicked off the phone . For the next five minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various houses they passed . Finally Regan said , " That 's our house up on the left . " " Oh , lovely , " Alvirah breathed , craning her neck to get a better look . " A lot nicer than the houses I used to clean , I 'll tell you that . " It was obvious that no one was home . The Reilly house , unlike its neighbors , was in total darkness . The long driveway extended to the garages at the rear of the house . The chauffeur stopped at the walk that led to the front door . " Let me go in with you while you check your messages , Regan , " Alvirah said , a note of concern in her voice . Regan knew what Alvirah meant . If there had been an accident , there might be a call on the machine . " I 'll be fine , Alvirah . I ca n't thank you enough . You need to get Willy home . " Reluctantly Alvirah watched Regan go up the steps and disappear into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway . They were just turning back onto the street when the soft ring of a cell phone made Alvirah look around quickly . I do n't have mine with me , she thought . Then she spotted it . The phone Regan had been using was on the seat next to her , its green light flashing . I 'll answer it , she thought . I bet it 's her father . She picked it up and flipped it open . " Hello , " she boomed happily . " Regan ? " The voice was deep and raspy . " I 'll get her , " Alvirah said , as she yelled for the driver to go back . " Is this her father ? " " It 's a message from him . " " Oh , good , " Alvirah shouted . As Alvirah jumped out of the car and ran up the walk , she did not hear C.B. 's comment to Luke : " Whoever answered your daughter 's phone has a voice like a foghorn . " Fred Torres hung up his uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap . " That 's it for two weeks , Vince , " he said to his partner . " It 's anchors away for me . " " I wish I were going sailing in the Caribbean , " Vince Lugano said as he pulled on a sweater . " While you 're on deck with a beer in your hand , I 'll be putting together a fire engine and a dollhouse . " The tiny lines around Fred 's dark brown eyes crinkled when he smiled . " You love every minute of it , " he said . " I know I do , " Vince agreed , looking with affection at the man who had become his best friend since they were sworn in as police officers in Hoboken , New Jersey , six years ago . Fred was twenty-eight years old , just under six feet tall , lean and muscular . His olive complexion , dark hair , and general good looks made him the perfect target for well-meaning friends who just happened to have an available sister or cousin . He was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the holidays . Vince , the same age as his partner , was two inches taller and twenty pounds heavier , with sandy hair and hazel eyes . He had never been interested in anyone except his high-school sweetheart , whom he married five years ago . " What time do you leave ? " Vince asked . " I 've got an eight o'clock flight tomorrow morning . " " You 'll be at Mike 's party tonight ? " " Sure . " " See you there . " Fred had intended to drive straight home to his apartment in a small brownstone at the south end of town . But he impulsively stopped when he turned the corner that led to his street and spotted the dazzling array of poinsettias in the flower-shop window . It wo n't take that long , he assured himself as he went in and selected a plant . He had met Rosita Gonzalez at a party a month ago , and they 'd gone out to dinner together a couple of times since . He had invited her to the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby-sit . As he got back in the car , he smiled , thinking of her and remembering the night they had met . They both had arrived at that party at the same time . He had parked behind her . She had been driving a glistening black limousine . As they walked up the steps together , he introduced himself and said , " You certainly arrive in style . " " Wait till you see what I go home in , " Rosita had joked . " Among my activities , I drive a limo . One of the guys I work with will be dropping off my car and taking this one . " When the party ended , Fred had walked her out to her twelve-year-old Chevy . " Just call me Cinderella , " she said with a smile . She seemed so young , with her long , dark hair and infectious laugh , that it was hard for him to believe that she was the mother of two little boys . " Does Cinderella have a phone number ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , Fred wondered if this was such a good idea . There was more traffic than he had expected , and he had n't begun to pack for his trip . He admitted to himself that showing up at her house might be sending Rosita the wrong message . He had no intention of getting too involved with anyone at this point . For the foreseeable future , he would n't have enough time to devote to a relationship especially one that involves kids , he thought . Rosita lived in a modest garden-apartment complex not far from Summit . The shortest day of the year was yesterday , Fred thought . I can believe it . At 4:30 it was completely dark . He parked in a visitor 's space , went up the path , shifted the festively wrapped plant to one hand , and rang the bell of Rosita 's ground-floor unit . Inside the apartment , seventeen-year-old Nicole Parma was in a state of near hysteria . At the sound of the chimes , she rushed to the door . " Your mother probably forgot her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of whom were sitting cross-legged in front of the television set . Neither one of them looked up . " Mommy never forgets her key , " six-year-old Chris said matter-of-factly to his younger brother . Only eleven months apart in age , they could pass for twins . " But Mommy said she 'd be home by now , " Bobby said , his voice low and troubled . " I do n't like Nicole . She wo n't play with us like Sarah does . " Sarah was their regular baby-sitter . Forgetting all of Rosita 's warnings about not opening the door until she knew who was on the other side , Nicole flung it open . Fred did not miss her look of acute disappointment when she saw him standing there . " Is Mrs. Gonzalez home ? " He took a step back , not wanting to suggest that he would make any attempt to enter unless invited . " No , and I expected her over an hour ago ! " The answer was almost a wail . " It 's Fred ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby echoed . Both boys were at the door , crowding past Nicole to greet him . " That 's Mommy 's friend ! " Chris told her . " He 's a policeman . He arrests people . " " Hello , you two . " Fred looked back at Nicole . " I just wanted to drop this plant off for the boys ' mother . " The boys were pulling at Fred 's jacket . " I can tell it 's all right if you come in , " Nicole said . " Rosita should be here any minute . " " Mommy better be here soon , " Chris volunteered as Fred stepped inside . " Nicole 's freaking out . She 's got to get ready for her dance tonight and does n't want to look ugly ' cause she lovvvvves her boyfriend . Ha ha ha , Nicole . " If looks could kill , Fred thought , as the young girl glared at Chris . " You brat ! I told you to hang up the phone when I was talking before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly wait . " Chris made a loud smacking sound with his lips . " Kissy , kissy , " Bobby repeated , mimicking his brother 's sing-song tone . " Come on , guys , " Fred said . " That 's enough . " He saw the tears shining in Nicole 's eyes . " You 're running late , I guess . " " Really late , " she confirmed , as her mouth quivered and the tears began to roll down her cheeks . " Has n't Rosita called ? " " No . I tried her cell phone , but there was no answer . " " She must be on her way home . " The same impulse that had made him stop at the flower shop elicited the next words from his mouth : " Look , I 've got some time . I can wait with the kids . " He started to pull out his police ID . " You can see the boys know me . " Chris ran over to an end table and picked up a framed picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Fred and his mother had met . " There he is ! " he cried , pointing at the photograph and running over to Nicole . " That 's him in the back row . " Nicole barely glanced at Fred 's ID or at the good-times snapshot before she was out the door , one arm already in the sleeve of her coat . " She 's a pain , " Chris observed . " All she did was talk on the phone with her boyfriend . Yuck . " " She would n't play checkers , " Bobby said quietly . " She would n't ? " Fred said , his voice suitably incredulous . " I love to play checkers . Let 's find a place to put Mommy 's plant , then we 'll see if you two can beat me . Red or black ? " When Regan opened the door , Alvirah waved the cell phone at her . " The call you 've been waiting for ! " she said breathlessly . Regan grabbed the phone . " Dad ? " Without hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to make sure everything 's all right , she told herself . But an instant later , judging by the look on Regan 's face , she was certain that something was very , very wrong . Instead of the voice Regan had been expecting to hear , she was chilled by a curt command , " You 'll talk to him in a minute . Get rid of whoever is with you . " This is n't the police or a hospital calling , Regan thought . She made a snap decision to let Alvirah stay . Not that she would have had much choice . Alvirah 's two feet were practically glued to the marble floor . But the concern in her eyes made Regan glad for her presence . " Thank you , Alvirah , " she said loudly . " I wo n't keep you . " She reached past her and noisily opened and closed the door . That guy does n't want anyone else to overhear what he 's telling Regan , Alvirah thought . Yanking open her coat , she quickly unhooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tiny hidden microphone , and handed the pin to Regan . Regan 's eyes widened at first , and then she nodded , realizing what Alvirah intended . " Let me talk to my father , " she said as she held the sunburst pin next to her ear and the earpiece of the phone . " Not so fast , " the gruff voice snapped . " I 've got a list of demands . " In the houseboat , Petey nodded his approval . " Kind of like a top-ten list , " he whispered to Luke , with a friendly punch to his manacled arm . C.B. glared at him . " Sorry . " C.B. continued . " You must have one million dollars in cash by tomorrow afternoon . It must be in one-hundred-dollar bills , in a duffel bag . At six o'clock on the dot , and I mean on the dot , be in your car driving into Central Park at the Sixth Avenue entrance . You will receive a phone call telling you where to leave the money . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his cutie-pie chauffeur again . Once the money has been received and counted , you 'll get a call about where to pick them up . " " I want to talk to my father now , " Regan demanded . C.B. walked over to Luke and held the phone to his ear . " Say hello to your little girl . And tell her she 'd better do as she 's told . " It was with heartsick relief that Regan heard Luke 's calm voice . " Hi , Regan . We 're both okay so far . Your mother will know where to get the money quickly . " Before Regan could answer , C.B. pulled the phone away . " That 's enough from you . It 's Rosita 's turn . " He was at her side . " Say hello to Regan . " The words rushed out of Rosita 's mouth . " Take care of my boys . " Again C.B. did n't give Regan a chance to respond . " Okay , Regan Reilly , " he said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'll be there , " Regan said . " But I have to talk to my father and Rosita again before I drop that money . " Trying to keep the mounting fury out of her voice , it was her turn to ask , " Right ? " " You 've got it , Regan . " The line went dead .
