MUSCLE POWER Here 's a low-tech solution to the high-tech problem of the cell-phone battery that dies without a car or a wall plug in sight . Motorola 's FreeCharge windup charger ( $80 ; available this summer ) lets you generate electricity with your upper-body strength . Just crank the handle for 30 sec. , and the charger converts that mechanical energy into enough juice to power a cell phone for five minutes . Special adapters that fit other popular phones are sold separately . <P> TALKING BLUES The Bluetooth wireless data standard is being incorporated into more and more gadgets , from laptops and printers to cell phones and Palm Pilots . What does it let you do ? A cool example : Sony Ericsson Bluetooth Headset HBH-30 ( $150 ) is a lightweight earpiece-microphone that lets you speak unobtrusively through a Bluetooth-enabled cell phone sitting in a backpack , a briefcase or even another room as far as 30 ft. away . <P> SHOW ON THE ROAD Next time you are away on a business trip , do n't use the boring old telephone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web camera ( $60 ) is designed especially for laptops ; hook one up at home and another on the road , and you will be able to see as well as hear your loved ones . QuickCams also make setting up on-the-road videoconferences as easy as accepting a first-class upgrade . <P>  --  By Roy B. White
