The first time you meet a robot can be pretty disappointing . Hollywood has taught us what to expect : a trusty sidekick like R2-D2 , a gleaming robo-maid like The Jetsons ' Rosey or a cyberassassin like the Terminator . The reality is very different : most robots are either mindless factory drones or blue-sky academic projects that cost a fortune , break down a lot and do n't do very much . Most of them do n't even have death rays . <P> Now meet Roomba , a new housecleaning robot spawned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Artificial Intelligence Lab and built by a Somerville , Mass. , company called iRobot . Roomba 's function is a humble one : it 's designed to vacuum your living room while you 're otherwise engaged . But Roomba also represents a technological watershed : it 's the first robot ever built that is designed to live in your home , serve a useful purpose and be priced for the mass market  --  at $199 , it costs about the same as a mid-range vacuum cleaner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just might be Rosey 's great-great-grandparent . <P> Roomba had three parents : Rodney Brooks , director of M.I.T. 's AI Lab , and two of his former graduate students , Colin Angle and Helen Greiner . Brooks , who was featured in the 1997 documentary Fast , Cheap , and Out of Control , is arguably the world 's greatest living roboticist . A voluble Australian , he 's famous for finding radical , counterintuitive approaches to intractable problems ; the NASA rover that went to Mars aboard Pathfinder was designed using techniques he pioneered . <P> With his two collaborators , Brooks spent the 1980s building experimental robots such as Genghis and Attila , six-legged insectoidal creatures with multiple onboard computers and dozens of sensors . These robots looked cool and cost a lot but on a practical level accomplished almost nothing . " You go into robotics thinking you 're going to change the world , " says Angle , who looks like a younger , nerdier Quaid brother . " You 're not going to change the world with a million-dollar robot . " In 1990 Angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , affordable robots for everyday life . <P> But first they had to learn some hard lessons about those difficult creatures known as human beings . A robot is essentially a computer with a body , but iRobot wanted to market its robots as household appliances . And it turns out people have higher standards for appliances than they have for computers . Appliances have to be cheap , simple and reliable ; nobody is going to buy a $2,000 vacuum cleaner that requires a Ph.D . in engineering and has to be rebooted twice a day . Leaving the ivory tower for the iRobot team was a culture shock . " We had to learn about plastics , " Angle sighs . " We had to learn about Far East manufacturing . We learned that if you have n't had a sit-down , drag-out , pound-on-the-table argument over a nickel , you do n't understand consumer products . " <P> The iRoboters also had to learn about a subject that most scientists never really study : cleaning floors . They got down on their knees and worked out the physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amounts of electricity , so they had to invent a new kind of low-power vacuum that would allow Roomba to run on rechargeable batteries . They ran their baby bot over " torture tracks " to test its mobility . They spent a night in a Target store to watch industrial cleaners at work .
