<p> When Army Capt . Patrick Murphy arrived in Iraq in June 2003 to head a combat team of the 82nd Airborne Division , IEDs were n't much on his mind . <p> " I 'd never even heard the term until I got over there , " says Murphy , now a Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania . By the time he left , his brigade had lost 19 people , many to IEDs , and the devices were the first thing he thought about every <p> time he took his unit on patrol . <p> " I led over 70 convoys , and I remember just looking ahead all the time over the concrete for IEDs , " he says . " By ( late 2003 ) , they were our biggest concern - IEDs first , then mortars , then snipers . " <p> Murphy was in Iraq when the IED threat was just emerging . When he left in 2004 , the devices had become the leading killer of U.S. troops , and they remain the leading killer of U.S. troops today . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and handwriting notes to the families of those who have been killed in action . . . and about 70% of them are the IEDs , " Defense Secretary Robert Gates said at a congressional hearing in March . " As soon as we . . . find one way of trying to thwart their efforts , ( the insurgents ) find a technology or a new way of going about their business . " <p> The evolution of IEDs in Iraq parallels the evolution of the tools the Pentagon has used to combat them . The placement of the IEDs , the ways they 're triggered , the explosives they employ - all of that has changed time and again as U.S. forces have tried different ways to detect , disable or protect themselves against the devices . <p> Much of the raw material used by insurgents to make IEDs - artillery shells and explosives , such as TNT and C-4 - was looted from Iraqi military ammunition caches that were not secured by U.S. forces immediately after the invasion , according to a March report by the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not securing these conventional munitions storage sites has been costly , " the GAO wrote . The looted material has given insurgents ammunition to " construct IEDs . . . and maintain the level of violence . " <p> Early IEDs were relatively small and straightforward , often a 155mm or 152mm artillery shell hidden in a wall or embankment along a road . Insurgents would run wire from the device to a handheld trigger , which they could activate from a nearby hiding place . <p> As U.S. troops figured out how to detect those IEDs , by spotting the wires or a suspicious character nearby , insurgents began using remote triggers - car key fobs , garage door openers , cellphones - to detonate the devices from greater <p> distances . They also turned to more powerful explosives , sometimes " daisy chaining " multiple artillery rounds to boost destructive force . <p> By March 2004 , " they were using daisy chains , 155mm rounds , maybe seven , eight in a row , " says Army Maj. Myles Caggins , who led a support company in Diyala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One IED blows up , everyone stops , and as people walk up to investigate , more blow up . The techniques changed . " <p> In late 2003 , as troops scoured Iraqi scrap yards for steel to fashion " hillbilly armor " for Humvees , the Pentagon began ordering add-on armor kits for the vehicles , including hardened steel doors and side panels . By May 2004 , under pressure <p> from Congress , the Army had delivered 7,000 kits ; more arrived in the months that followed . <p> Around that time , troops also started getting their first large scale deliveries of jammers : devices that can be mounted in a vehicle or , in some cases , carried in a backpack , to block the wireless signals insurgents used to set off IEDs . <p> The insurgents adapted faster . <p> By early 2004 , they 'd begun burying IEDs under roads , so they would blast up through the thin floors that proved to be the Achilles ' heel of even the armored Humvees . And the use of those buried IEDs grew steadily over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . <p> The triggers changed , too . As more jammers arrived , insurgents reverted to hard-wired devices or switched to pressure-plate IEDs , which go off when a vehicle rolls over them . By 2006 , U.S. troops were seeing " baking trays , " in which C-4 is sandwiched between metal plates and set to explode when compressed by a vehicle . <p> " They have adapted every time we 've come up with a new way to defeat them , " says Rep. John Murtha , D-Pa. , a combat veteran and critic of the war . <p> Now , they 're adapting again , using IEDs that employ " explosively formed projectiles , " known as EFPs . Those devices fire a metal slug that becomes a molten projectile as it travels toward its target . They are so powerful that they 've been described as capable of slicing through an Abrams tank . <p> The Pentagon is developing yet another armor kit - this time to put on already armored vehicles , including MRAPs and Humvees - that can protect against EFPs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack our tactical mobility . . . and they 've chosen the IED as the way to do that , " says retired Marine general Anthony Zinni , former chief of the U.S. Central Command . " This is the first war where we 've faced an enemy that 's adapted better than we have at a tactical and operational level . We had IEDs from Day 1 . . . . What have we done to adapt ? Nothing . <p> " The best counter to the IED is to get into the head of the guy who 's planting it . If he 's doing it for a buck , give him a better job . If he 's doing it because he 's pissed off , give him some promise of a better life , " Zinni adds . " If you say there <p> has to be a technical solution , a silverbullet , you 're not going to win . "
