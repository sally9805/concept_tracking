COMMUTING ON FULL SUSPENSION In the November issue , Style Man rips a guy for using a full-suspension LTS as a commuter bike . Sounds like tofu-eating , California pansy talk to me . I ride an LTS to work I also ride it on the nastiest mountain trails I can find , but that 's beside the point The urban advantages : * it goes in snow * you ride longer on the inevitable ice patches * who cares if it gets salty and dirty * knobbies live longer among broken beer bottles * you can take lots of shortcuts across curbs , median strips , grass patches and drainage ditches . You road weenies are too intolerant . I keep a nice Italian road bike , but I use it for 100- to 500-mile rides . It 's not a fashion statement . Robert Siegfried via Internet 400 MILES OF GOOD ROAD It was good to see your short reference to our corner of the world ( " There 's a Road There ? " Rides , Nov . ) . But there are a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route you 're referring to , the Kettle Valley Railway , ran from Midway , British Columbia to Hope , British Columbia-quite a bit longer than the 133 miles of it you highlight . The total length is closer to 300 miles , and you can add spurs for another 100 miles or so of scenic side trips . I use the book Cycling The Kettle Valley Railway ( Dan and Sarah Langford , Rocky Mountain Books ) to explore some of the rail bed .

" I ca n't come biking tomorrow night because I have to clean my aquarium . " - Endo , Oct. 6 , 1999 Rolf Pemberton Arlington , VA SUCK WHEELS , MAKE BREAKS Your articles make a difference ! I 've been riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend . After a lot of yo-yoing and spastic pack antics I found the " steady , smooth rider to latch onto " ( " How to Suck Wheel , " Skills , Nov . ) . We made eye contact , and gave each other the needed space on climbs and in difficult turns . We made a break a good ways out before the finish . I went all-out and never looked backa stealthy attack , no histrionics or water bottles thrown ( " 9 Secrets to Breakaway Power , " Aug . ) . No big deal-except I finished 11 th out of 68 in the second race of my life ! Thanks . Brent Thornton Austin , TX - MORE ANSWERS FROM-LANCE Did Bill Strickland ask Lance Armstrong any questions regarding the role God played in Armstrong 's life over the past two years ? ( " I Owe My Life to Cancer , " Nov . ) Is Lance a lucky man or a blessed man ? I 've never had cancer or won the Tour de France-still I think I am greatly blessed by God to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bill Jung Wichita Falls , TX Sorry , no ecclesiastical outtakes from the intervew . But here are three questions that did n't make the original story . Explain the mountain biking thing . LANCE : Well , the first thing is , I enjoy it . I love to ride my mountain bike . Everybody in the sport thinks I 'm crazy . Another thing is : With mountain bike races I have no ego at all . I do n't try to make it look pretty . Photograph // If I have to get off and run or climb over something , no problem . BICYCLING:Were you surprised how big your victory was with America 's general public ? LANCE : Yeah-really surprised . I was on a ride and stopped at a gas station in the middle of Colorado , middle of nowhere , and there was a bike path there . This middle-aged lady on a rental bike saw my jersey and said , " Oh , are you on the Postal team I saw on TV " And I said , " Yeah " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She never watched a bike race in her life . BICYCLING:How much motivation was revenge-or the teams that snubbed you when you had cancer ? LANCE : I do n't know if revenge is the right word . During the Tour I did n't think about the teams that did n't believe in me , or the team that fired me . They were in the race also . I did n't need to say anything to them . I still do n't need to dignify them . To plug into Lance , go to www.lat.org or www.LanceArmstrong.com . WE ENRAGE HIM Your magazine enrages me every time I open ft . BICYCLING was once a bastion of intelligent writing set against a backdrop of juvenile bike rags . Now it 's a nod to the fact that our culture is becoming more frenzied , more harried , less attentive and more like MTV every day . PS . Do you think I 'll win the T-shirt ? Dave Rohlf Lakewood , CO NEVER RIDE WITHOUT EARS In your November Maintenance section you suggest riding with headphones and music to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clause ( " Do n't tune out traffic " ) it seems highly irresponsible to suggest such a potentially dangerous practice . If the music can drown out a saddle squeak , it can drown out a fellow rider saying " on your left , " a car approaching a little too close , a dog 's collar jingling as the canine takes a bite out of your rear tire .... Whether riding a bike , running or even walking around other people or in traffic , a person should always be aware and alert to his surroundings . This can not happen with muffled hearing . Lee Cowgill Harker Heights , TX ONE MORE POSTRIDE CHECK Your question-answering pro Wrench ( Maintenance , Nov. ) is certainly not an urban rider . His two-minute checklist of things to do after a road ride left off the first thing I do : Check the tires for embedded glass , and then proper inflation . These two precautions can prevent a lot of tire problems . Bill Mcllvaine Chicago WAY UP IN TURNS Your advice and illustration on swooping through turns ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one point . After 25 years of motorcycling and a few years of cycling I 've learned to be cautious crossing from one side of the lane to the other-especially if the pavement is wet . There 's a collection of oil , antifreeze , gasoline , diesel fuel and other slippery stuff in the area between the two tracks where car tires run . This stuff becomes particularly slippery during the first few minutes of rain and worse yet if it 's been a while since the last rain . So be careful when you swoop . David Cook Tarentum , PA SPRINTER OF THE MONTH I enjoyed " Going Faster , " your article on speed in the October issue . It got me thinking : How would a cyclist compare to a car in acceleration ? ( Who has n't tried to beat the accelerating traffic after a green light ? ) After a 20-minute warm-up , I managed a standing quartermile time of 35 seconds with a top speed of 35 mph . I 'd like to hear from anyone who knows any records for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles MOUNTAIN BIKE SHOES - IN PACELINES " How to Suck Wheel " ( Skills , Nov. ) contained an insulting and ignorant statement-someone who 's riding mountain bike shoes and pedals probably is n't a good person to be behind in a paceline . Everyone-EVERYONE- know with any knowledge of bikes rides mountain bike pedals and shoes when not actually racing . Maybe we do n't have the unpopulated farmland that you have to ride . With as much in-town riding as we do , road pedals are totally goosey and give unsecure footing . The only disadvatage is a couple of grams-not significant in anything but a full-race situation . My shoes look just like yours but with tread . You look like a goose . I look way cool ! John Griswold via Internet " ADMIRING " LANCE WOO ! What a great pic of Lance Armstrong on the cover of the November issue ! ! 1 ! If it was n't against company policy , I would hang it in my cubicle next to the terrific poster from last month . What a fox ! ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . ) You guys rock . Let me say it again-WOO ! ! ! ! ! YOWSA ! ! ! ! ! Karen Canzoneri San Mateo , CA PEDALING CIRCLES The story about pedaling circles in the Love section ( Oct. ) reminded me that I taught myself to pedal in a circle before I knew that was the way . Photograph // I started to do a little " flipper kick " at or near the bottom of my pedal stroke-so my feet and ankles could assist my weak , fat legs through the upstroke . ( Try it , feels like your pedal stroke is suddenly covered in grease . ) Nine years after evolving this shortcut , my stroke is smooth as silk . I 'm a pro bike mechanic , and this secret lets me trail good riders by a fairly short distance .
