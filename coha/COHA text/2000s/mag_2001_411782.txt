<p> AMERICANS WILL SPEND $140 BILLION in connection with the federal income tax before paying the U.S. Department of the Treasury a single penny this year , reports the newsletter , Tax Features . The $140 billion figure accounts for the time , energy and materials that taxpayers devote to complying with the complicated income tax system . The price tag of compliance equals 4.6 billion hours of paperwork . Translated into personnel , it amounts to a work force of 2,235,000 , which is more workers than employed by the auto , computer manufacturing , airline manufacturing and steel industries combined . The $140 billion figure , says economist J. Scott Moody , underestimates the true cost of complying with the income tax code because it does not account for the value of the productivity gains that would have occurred had people been working more instead of filling out forms . Also excluded from the estimate are the costs of the IRS bureaucracy itself , the Tax Court , and the litigation expenses incurred by individuals who dispute tax questions . <p> If the tax code were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cut " would be progressive in nature because low- and middle-income taxpayers spend a larger proportion of their resources on compliance than do the wealthy , says Moody . The cost of compliance for those with adjusted gross incomes of less than $20,000 averages 4% of their AGI . <p> WHO SAYS SHOPPING IS A HASSLE ? With new technologies spreading rapidly throughout the retail industry , customers can play " cashier , " surf the Web , and find out if the items they need are in stock  --  all without searching up and down every aisle . Internet-enabled kiosks , do-it-yourself scanners , and employees armed with wireless devices are proliferating in grocery stores and big chains that believe they can combat long lines with these high-tech conveniences . In addition to their entertainment value , the innovations provide shorter lines , immediate answers , and impartial customer service to those who are not threatened by oddly shaped , high-tech gadgets . <p> According to U.S. News &; World Report , Kmart is installing self-service scanners in 1,300 stores . Home Depot is also testing the scanners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will carry palm-sized machines that locate shoes  --  either in stock or at other chain locations . Since the debut of Borders ' " Title Sleuth " kiosk , book sales and impulse purchases have risen at the chain . <p> ONLY 13 OF NEARLY 400 INTERNET DRUGSTORES are certified by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy . Nevertheless , online drug purchases are expected to increase from $23 million to $1 billion in just a few years , and most of these transactions will occur illegally , reports Chemical &; Engineering News . Many Internet sites sell pharmaceuticals to customers without prescriptions . A credit card number is all that is needed to purchase hormones , antibiotics , anticancer pills , life-style drugs like Viagra , Propecia , and Xenical , and narcotics from online pharmacies . Often operating in foreign countries  --  though numerous sites are based in the U.S.  --  and evading the watchful eye of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , these illicit vendors can sell counterfeit , out-of-date , unapproved , and deadly combinations of products . <p> Online pharmacies provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the easy click of a button , but those operating illegally present the unsuspecting consumer with many dangers . They also pose significant challenges for customs and health officials who have trouble locating the online businesses and confiscating their imports . Efforts to crack down on domestic offenders resulted in about 88 arrests and 44 convictions over the last few years , but the battle against overseas operations has just begun . Studies in California and Virginia have shown that approximately 90% of drug-containing parcels entering the country violate U.S. law . <p> WIRELESS PHONE COMPANIES , TELEVISION BROADCASTERS , and the U.S. military are all engaged in a political tug-of-war over electromagnetic spectrum . The outcome of the struggle could determine the fate of so-called third-generation ( 3G ) wireless technology , reports Red Herring . The U.S. wireless industry wants more spectrum allocated for 3G , but the U.S. Department of Defense and television broadcasters already occupy prime spectrum " real estate . " At stake , according to the wireless industry , is the technogical prowess of the U.S. Currently , Japan , Germany , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum allocated for wireless services . The more populous United States , on the other hand , has only 189 MHz of spectrum for wireless . With this limited amount of spectrum , wireless carriers can add capacity only by " splitting " their cell sites or adding more towers . The cost , more than $1 million per " split " , is passed on to consumers , resulting in higher prices , but lower quality service . The DOD refuses to give up its part of the spectrum , arguing the switch to another band would be too costly and would not accommodate the DOD 's sophisticated communications technologies . ( It wants to develop live battlefield video from cameras on soldiers ' helmets . ) Television broadcasters also covet their ultra-high frequencies . <p> Third-generation wireless is likely to comprise 4% of the world 's mobile technologies in 2005 . At the current rate , Western Europe will conduct 13% of its mobile transactions on 3G , but only 3% of North American mobile affairs will use the new technology , reports Red Herring . <p> WHILE THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some smaller carriers serving rural America might never resume operations , reports The Washington Times . Regional airlines rely on a constant flow of revenue to maintain their services , and the $1.3 billion losses that occurred during the flightless days of September had an enormous effect on these 95 fleets . A shrinking demand for air travel complicates the efforts to make up for losses that accumulated during the three-day grounding period . <p> Many regional lines have been forced to close , leaving passengers and packages miles from departure gates and destinations . Congress and the White House are working to bestow billions of federal aid dollars on the struggling flight industry , but the amount of cash going specifically to regional airlines has yet to be determined . <p> FED UP WITH LONG WAITING TIMES AND RUSHED SERVICE , some consumers are opting to pay a premium for special " concierge care " from doctors . In exchange for paying a yearly retainer , typically in the thousands of dollars , patients can be seen by doctors who have fewer patients , and thus more time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-wait appointments , same-day lab results , and home delivery of drugs , reports the Wall Street Journal . <p> Some of the " concierge care " practices do not accept insurance or Medicare , requiring that their patients pay in cash . While only a handful of doctors offer " concierge care , " the practice has drawn some critics who argue that the emergence of this type of care is simply another symptom of a broken health care system . Also , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is looking into the practice to see if accepting fees violates Medicare rules that prohibit doctors who accept Medicare reimbursement from contracting outside the system . <p> SOCIAL ENGINEERING HAS MADE NEW INROADS into the world of banking , reports Forbes . A house or condo buyer in San Francisco , Seattle , Los Angeles , or Chicago can now get a mortgage 45% bigger than his or her income would normally allow on the condition that the house or condo purchased is near a subway or bus stop . The brainchild of the Natural Resources Defense Council , location-efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green agenda on public transportation . The theory behind location-efficient mortgages  --  developed with grants from the Environmental Protection Agency , the Department of Transportation , and the Department of Energy  --  is that buyers who save money by using public transportation can afford to spend a greater portion of their income on housing . Thus , they can qualify for larger mortgages . But qualifiers are not even obligated to use the transportation systems that got them the larger mortgages . <p> Economists Allen Blackman and Alan Krupnick of the think tank Resources for the Future point out that the presence of public transportation has little effect on default rates , reports Forbes . They observe , in a soon-to-be released report , that borrowers in areas that will qualify for location-efficient mortgages have default rates that are the same as borrowers of similar income levels in areas that will not qualify for location-efficient mortgages . If these two groups have similar default rates , then loosening the terms of borrowing  --  offering higher debt-to-income ratios and lower down payments  --  for the group will qualify will very likely result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mae likely picking up the bill . <p> INEXPERIENCE AND IMMATURITY MAKE TEENS , as a group , the most dangerous drivers . Sixteen-year-old drivers , in particular , contribute disproportionately to the number of crashes on America 's roads . In an effort to curb the crash record of young motorists , 34 states and the District of Columbia adopted three-level graduated driver 's licensing ( GDL ) systems , and two studies published in October by JAMA ( the Journal of the American Medical Association ) show that the licensure programs in North Carolina and Michigan are working . Crash rates of 16-year-olds in the two states decreased by 23% and 25% , respectively . <p> The GDL system stretches the typical six-week classroom and behind-the-wheel drivers ' education program into three stages that occur between the ages of 15 and 18 . Under this system , a teen who completes a year-long period of completely supervised driving and six subsequent months of prohibited unsupervised nighttime driving without getting a single traffic violation earns a full , unrestricted license . Though the programs appear to have helped in reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear . Naturally , when fewer drivers are on the road , a condition that the GDL system creates , fewer crashes will occur . <p>
