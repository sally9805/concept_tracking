Children with Matches What force is there in the thing given which compels the recipient to make a return ? Marcel Mauss , The Gift SOUNDS Imagine carpflickering metallic orange , not gold . Their movements delightful to behold as swamp grasses swaying on the edge of an ornamental pond . Natural , by design so natural . The carp are the idea of George Baird , President of Baird Bank and Trust . He has caused the gutting of this pond , the cementing of its retaining walls to simulate crags and timeworn crannies . He believes his carp to be old , that the same stock performs for him these twenty years , flashing like dancers in the Burly-que over in Troy or hovering in tranquillity like their gilt images on a Japanese screen . His fish are that versatile . George Baird is set out by his fish pond , tucked up in lap robes . He is dying . The day is resplendent with the warmth of false Spring , so his doctor allows this excursion . Baird has sent his nurse back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cup of tea . Free of her fussing at last , with difficulty he wheels his invalid chair closer to the black water , the better to see his treasures , for they have emerged from their Winter torpor . During the Winter the carp do not feed . Banker Baird , as the mill hands once called him , does not feed . The taste of milk toast and junket is abhorrent , nursery food spooned out at life 's entrance and exit . His flesh hangs pale and bruised from his bones , though he is sothoroughly swaddled only one hand moving fitfully and his bulbous head topped with a jaunty fedora can be seen . The overseers and engineers who came to his office , caps in hand , knew him as the broad barrel of a man with a thicket of unruly hair who let their notes run till next payday . He knew you as Canuck , Polack , Irish . On Sunday you took the wife and kids on the trolley to Baird 's placea good walk past the end of the lineto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like youthat he was uncomfortable buttoned into the worsted suit pulling at his shoulders and high belly , that he had once earned his living by the labor of his hands . It was memorable , the crushing grip of his handshake granting your first mortgagethe small lot you would proudly build on in town . His ring , set with diamonds big as headlights on his touring car , was an affront to the town merchants and to the lawyers educated at Williams and Harvard , who 'd lost the Yankee art of cutting a shrewd deal . They went , when invited , to Baird 's showplace beyond sidewalks and city water , although by arrangement , let 's call it an arrangement , the phone and electricity lines extended to his world . He contributed to the Congregational church but did not enter its pure whitewashed walls . His raucous baritone laughter broke the sanctimonious whisper of cash counted out in the mighty hall of his bank . From his post by the pond , George Baird can not see the grand house which lies behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back be turned to that investment in shingles , lime and bricks . His son now lives there with his pickle of a wife , a mean spirited do-gooder , and their two little girls , Lily and Rose . They have taken possession , filled the rooms with their discontent . The sour wife dusts and mops and scours . No servant save the nurse , Miss Wipe Arse , an annoyance . In the mighty brick mills and factories along the Housatonic it has been launchedthe next downward cycleand how will this son survivehis second son no better than a clerk at the bank , a mild , evasive man not party to his wife 's spiritual ambition . If the patriarch had words , could spew forth more than clotted vowels , he would say , Do not foreclose . By Jesus , boy , I did not shut down in the Great Depression of ' 07 . And in a period of recovery built this damn house you have never enjoyed . In his mind , which is clear as the sky above , the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first son . The pond intended as a watery diversion for the weary soldier home from the Great War . And did n't that brave fella love to spot the biggest fish-supple , iridescent , leader of the packthough the soft-finned koi could lose them all , slip away without a ripple . George Baird was planning ahead to a tennis court when the golden son died of the Spanish flu in 1919 . Such a bustle in the water plants provided for his exotic minnows . The females laying their eggs . He will not live to see them hatch . He fears he will not live to hear the insistent comfort of Spring peepers . A flash of graceful tail , the rare koi , an arrogant fellow much like the gilded fish suspended in calm waters on his Japanese screen which that woman has folded away in a crippling Christian gesture , that woman ( pretending he ca n't recall her name ) , the woman married to his son , the clerk . Not the glimmering fish she counts sinful , but the seductive brush strokes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maidens posturing in their embroidered kimonos , tending to their luxurious hair . The gentle slap , slapping of water on concrete in the wake of some minor disturbance in the reeds , and in the distance the lopping of limbs , his son working in the woods , forging his solitary trails . George Baird locates himself in the daymidafternoon . The bronze doors at his bank are locked to its unhappy clients . His son should be there tending to desperate business , not plotting his folly . George Baird , President of the failing bank , can not in the end , knowing it 's his end , pass on his title to the woodsman who ca n't tell good ash from chokecherry , who , with a dainty silver lead pencil , takes notes on the weeds underfootskunk cabbage , bedstraw , cancerroot . And then the repetitive tune , his granddaughters home from school , the gangly girl , Rose , her high shoulders hunched over the spinet , playing her scales , obedient da-deedle-dum-dum , deedlee-da , his insufferable daily penance . Banker Baird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spinet in the parlor purchased as furniture in 1910 , along with his wife 's Limoges , the Tiffany tea service , the mahogany dining room set . In that same year he procured the Japanese screen , the only thing in the lot he cared for . Midafternoon . A long shadow stretches across the lawn , the turret of his house catching up with an old man , chilling his bones . How often his wife climbed the back stairs so narrow and steep to that useless rotunda , freeze your tits off in Winter , hell in the Summer heat . To read . To sew . She held with that story . To absent yourself , Miss High and Mighty . She has been absent now for some years , at rest in her family 's vault , a fancy dollhouse of death . George Baird has instructed that his remains be stuck in New England earth with no marker . Da-deedlee-da-da , deedlee-dum-dum .

He has always marveled at how they survive , dormant , unfed in the cold ; burrowing into the mud in a dry season . He hears the death knell of Nursey 's tread on gravel , the tinkle of cup and saucer , the snap of her starched apron , but has one moment left to himself , mumbling the undeliverable message , a gargle of o , o , o'sDo not foreclose . Dum-diddlee-dum . Diddlee-dum-dum . Rose has turned the page , progressing in her Czerny Exercises . Lily , dull as a dumpling , colors another picture for Grampa , red for the King 's cape , yellow for his crown . Dum-dum-diddlee-dum . In the woodslop , lopa split second of silence between the cut and thud on the ground .

In 1933 , as the snow held fast to the peak of Monument Mountain , scrip was issued again , with nothing behind it but the town 's desperate belief in Banker Baird 's son . It was Spring , and Julian listening for the crazy courtship flight of the woodcock at dusk , for the rustle of the red fox emerging from his Winter lair , did not hear his father 's garbled order , but Julian Baird made good on every note of the funny money . He did not foreclose . CHILDREN WITH MATCHES Spook house . Attractive nuisance . Children in the neighborhood no longer wonder at shutters banging off hinges , the flutter of curtains at blank windows . No way a thrill in their tough street life . Spook house , only attractive to me . Wind sucks down through the chimney , a fierce April shower splashing out of gutterswhat 's left of them . Silent carpenter ants work away at the listing veranda , labor endlessly at their hills of powdery decay . I am in the tower where my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-eyed story with a prince . If he cares to find me looking down from a modest shingle turret , which as a girl I imagined to be a tower high above the sweeping lawns and woodsthe family land . Once-upon-a ... In those days a stone floor was exposed to the elements where a carriage house once stood . Children with matches . The charred ruins had been cleared away . I scoured the Belgian blocks for treasureworn chips of glass , mysterious brass fittings . And what did they know , two old women who kept me in the gloomy tower ? How could they possibly know , with their doors bolted , their shades drawn , to blame children with matches ? The only wicked child in clear view was me . The horses gone before their time , long gone , Dobbin and Rascals of their legends , the illustrious names dusted off for a moody girl , though they recalled each automobile driven out of the carriage housethe Auburn , the DeSoto , the dark green Lincoln with opera windows . As though I cared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave diddly-squat for their fancy garage , their uppity porte cochre which held fast to the house over a circular drive so that in some tiresome dead time they were sheltered from the scalding sun . And from the softest Spring rain , was n't that so ? Old girls checking glories of the past . Peonies round the gazebo . That would be Lily . By the tool shed . Correction came by way of Rose . More children with matches , for this house stood alone , ungarnished by outbuildings . When I was first closed in the tower , I saw at a glance that in their vast garden there was no place to hide . I 'm up in that drafty room again , listening for the squeal of a hinge , creak of stair tread . No place to hide if he comes , the man I 'm determined to kiss into life . No craggy frog princebelieve me , he 's handsome , smooth . You may think him too old to be my lover . As a child I was called Marie Claude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marie Claude ! Marie Claude ! " the chirping of those creatures who held me hostage in the tower . Eventually I might go down to supper and not sulk , make one of them , most likely Lily , the stout one in bangles and gossamer scarves , huff and puff up the stairs to the door of my chamber , bumping her head on the low lintel . Eventually , but for the punishing moment I narrowed my eyes , despising a clot of cement in the brown lawn and the dark tangle of woodland . To the East , they told me , lay the fish pond now dry , and to the West Daddy 's Timber Trail , schooling me in their sacred geography . To the West the sun burnt its way through the pitch pines and birches where final hillocks of snow clung in darkness to matted leaves . Beyond the woods , white chimney smoke rose , wavered through the fiery end of day , and oh ! if only I , too , might be carried by the wind , dissolve in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose stooping in the doorway , the tall whiskered one come for me , the one dressed all in grey flannel like a giant mouse in Nutcracker , which I was taken to with much ceremony and dress-up by my mother . That was Christmas , a glittering evening in the city , and now it was Springmud season in this Northern industrial town . I had been dumped , an angry child with a permanent frown , abandoned to these witches ( elderly aunts ) , confined to the tower ( sewing room of a rackety old house ) while my mother ( on an amorous adventure ? ) flew away . One night , before the door to the tower was pawed open , before the great mouse with bristly grey hair smiled her nibbling smile , Marie Claude , as I was then , scooted out , down the steep back stairs once good enough for serving girls . Out through the chill solarium , off to the shadows and glowering branches of the forest . A nasty escapade , not a story to tell my silver haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just weeks ago , and looked down , the trees were gone , one ancient pine left , darkly drooping as a widow . Hans , Hans Gruen , settled on the window seat to a stack of old Life magazines . The very spectacles sliding down his nose were distinguished . How amazing that Hans Gruen came with me to the spook house , a man busy with his conferences , his corporate boards . Unwilling to reveal the cruelty of a childhood prank , I did n't tell him of that night long ago when I ran for the dark woods . Terrifying , though often in the Brothers Grimm a child encounters a helpful bird or tattered peasant with a loaf of bread , no more marvelous than Hans coming with me to this ghost ridden place . Looking down through the rattling sash windows , I saw a small yard with that mournful tree and exhausted forsythia blooming wearily over a chain-link fence that sets the house apart from a few rinky-dink trailers to the East , a strip mall to the West . " They locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies . In the dusty Spring twilight , I examined a skein of grey wool , in its strands tiny curls of dead moth worms , brittle and dry . I fingered a bit of rose chiffon , a limp scrap of violet sateen , and heard them again , the harmless old crones who have willed me their house " Marie Claude ! Marie Claude ! " Hans paced the room , circling the cutting table , a trunk with trans-Atlantic stickers , a Morris chair in full decline . " You can make quick work of this . " His voice betrayed no impatience as he tapped a Singer sewing machine , gilt flowers girdling the swell of its Victorian body . His tapered fingers tap , tap , tapping . Prince . Lover . Piss-poor abstractions . Maddeninghis manicure , exquisite haircut , the denim work shirt he affects . His generosity seemed programmed at that moment , self-aware , and I found nothing more to say to this curried specimen I 'd brought to view my miserable inheritance . That 's where your disappointment gets you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I expected from a desolate house , discarded even in memory , but had n't I hoped for something , a sentimental shardone cut glass goblet , a weightless teacup with faded gold rim ? " Quick work ? I have to come back for the lawyer . " And for Spero 's Quality Homes . Tilda Spero , the real estate woman already entrusted with my sale , had greeted us at the busted iron gate and handed over the keys to the house now mine . A woman professionally suited up for work , but her station wagon waiting at the curb in a downtrodden neighborhood was full of children in Catholic school uniformspunching , shoving each other in some hilarious game . Not a chatty sort , Tilda Spero forced a smile " This is no longer a residential zone " then , looking from the unruly kids in the car to the shattered windows of the house , " more of an attractive nuisance , I 'd say . " I made it clear that Mrs. Spero 's duties were over for the day , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on her theme : the dangling electric fixtures , rusted heating vents were a menace . Though the leaded glass , the green tiles framing the fireplacelovely Arts and Crafts . " If only , " Hans said , " twenty , thirty years ago ... " " If only they had died earlier ? " I 'd thought that as we drove upstate , and if only the company in this company town had not left for cheap labor , then my great-grandfather 's house with its parklike acres would still be intact . " They lived to an inconvenient old age . " " How old , Claude ? " " Sorry ! " His age a running joke between us . Our May/December problem no problem at all , and there was my admission what with my mother dead , my father practiced at keeping his distance , I wanted to be no one 's daughter . " The aunts were old when I was a kid . Especially the great mouse . " The artist ? " That was the roly-poly . She did something fey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's horror in the parlor of this house . " " A commercial property then . And the other one ? " " Music . " I was reluctant to speak of the other one , a tall drink of water bundled in grey sweaters and stockings , her steel wool head bobbing over the yellowed keys of a spinet , spidery fingers stumbling through flashy arpeggios . Each night , after supper , I had been her captive audience while the artiste readied the sloppy desserts to be served in the library , some ritual that went back to Daddy or to Dobbin 's day . A story too foolish for this serious man ; still , I laughed outright at the memory " Blancmange ! Bread puddings ! " " Hungry ? " Hans checking his watch . Always checking the time allotted . " Desperate . I bet there 's no place fit to eat in this town . " A bet I lost , for Hans can find the one perfect restaurant in Keokuk or Belgrade and found it on the mostly deserted main street : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prune whip . On our way back to the city , I slept the heavy meal off , but later that night roamed the tidy rooms of my lover 's apartment , still unfamiliar to me , worrying that I had shown him too much or too little of my past . The house on Park Street pitiful , no more than a dreary picture of domestic declinenot a sea of sweltering tents in the refugee camps of an African country Hans Gruen had recently advised , as though in a land laid waste by tribal wars and AIDS , he must propose a faint hope of economic prosperity . With that decent thought , I believed I was no pouting princess . Just lucky for once in my life . I switched on the light over his desk to see what hour of the restless night . There was the kidskin calendar embossed with his name , a full calendar with his departures to mostly foreign cities ; there , too , the dead wife , handsomethe grown sons with merely pretty wives , the gap-toothed grandson in a sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , this family he had scheduled in . How my Hans suffers his sons ' suburban success , the chill embrace of their admiration . A little late in the day , he 's discovered there 's no way to bridge the gulf . I bathe in his contrition . Look , I have captured my prize , we both know it . And there , set apart , the photo ops , my economist with men of statewith Kissinger , CarterHans , almost boyishwith Thatcher , Mitterrand , with the Pope for God 's sake . His sharply cut features are now smooth as the profile on a worn coin . But what had I not told him ? That I had been deposited in the spook house for a short season between the convent in Montreal and the lyce in Paris , a packing up , moving on time , moving to the best post my father would ever have . And that my mother had sublet a tiny flat in New York , a pied -- terre . Molly Montour would toss that term at the Baird sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to look after Marie Claude . Yes , to help with my lessons , but truly to keep me with them for some weeks to get the feel of family , of home , the place her people came from . This plot was presented by my mother as a gift to all parties , and then she skipped off to an interim affair . How did a kid know that for certain ? Know the smell of Havana cigars in her clothes . My father did not smoke . Know the gold link bracelet never worn , hiding in its velvet pouch at the back of her dresser drawer . Know that in Molly 's wandering life , I must wait for her in odd places until she turned up once more . Listen , it was never Christmas holidays , Summer visits . For one cold season I was given over to childless women who had n't a clue . I was n't a prisoner in their tower , merely sent up to answer simple questions in workbooks of math and French . I never saw the aunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy card to the hospice on the Maryland shore . How the news of that death came to them was unclear . Their card was signed in the big open script of good children . Aunt Lily . Aunt Rose . There is no mystery in the lawyer finding me in the age of accessible identities from which no one can hide . When I flipped through my mail and discovered the letter with the postmark of this town , I was shamed , the wounded shame of a naughty child . Now I 'm simply mortified that these poor souls thought of me at all . Thought to please me with their gift . Sowaiting for Hans to come get me . I 've set a rusted pot under a leak in the ceiling . A downpour veers to the West , flapping the sheet-metal roof of Jimbo 's Bakery . My day begins with a cruller and cup of weak coffee at the counter of this greasy shop nestled between a laundromat and a nail salon . Each morning , crossing the tarmac , I think Daddy 's Timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Spero . I never guessed how slow the other businessmemory , a swiping at dust in unreachable corners . I soon lost track of the week , then countedthis is the day he will come , if he comes . Testing him , testing , an old habit with me , testingone , two , testingto see if my claim rings true . Hans Gruen must drive right under the porte cochre , sheltering him from the Spring rain , is n't that so . Ridiculous , we will drive back to the city in a convoy of two . But first he must climb the stairs to the tower to find me , listen to the ping , ping , ping of water in my pail , then take me home . Home , his spare widower 's apartment . Or home , the cramped room and a half , two blocks from the community college where I teach . If you asked me a while back , I 'd have said it would take a miracle to get me out of my safe nest . The home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father was State , Foreign Service , honorable , The Honorable Jack Montour , to put the best light on his career . We moved about . In her final days , my mother confused the houseboy ( Bogot ) with the cook ( Ivory Coast ) . She insisted the chaise longue was lost on its way to Marseille . We knew it was the Shaker bed . Awful for us , her daughter and husband by the bedside , Molly 's fevered mind recalling the many households we presumed she did not love . It came to me then that her beauty had led her astray , may have masked much ordinary life that she cared for . In a way we banked on her ripeness-is-all , her extravagant body to let Moll go her way and to keep us in line . Now her prattle was of Wedgwood bought at Harrods , of the Portuguese soup tureenall broken in transit . Awful , so awful we believed it was the morphine speaking , easing the constriction of her failing heart . In what seemed a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a fire sale at Macy 's . How clearly she remembered the vast display of recycled domestic goods-abandoned chairs , tables , double boilers , baby cotsfrom which she chose the rattan couch to overlook the Bosporus where Russian tankers with more than oil sailed by , ships in the night . " Which you reported on , dutiful Jack . " " Now , Molls , " my father said to stop her spilling the beans , open secrets no longer buried in the files . The hairdresser came in the room with brush and harmless hair spray . Imagine Molly Montour waving her away , no longer vain or interested in the dignity of her dying , her hair a fright of white roots gaining on ash blond tangles . Taking our turns , we waited . Toward dawn , she roused herself . I was alone with her in the room . " That house was the best , " she said , " stairs to the sewing room , high , so high .... " I knew at once it was the tower she spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she once left me . " Why the best ? " I asked . " Please tell me ! " " But you were too often away , Marie Claude , too often away at school . " Scrambling the years , my mother gave me the only clue that she ever missed me . I 'm gratefultoo grateful do n't I know itfor her final words . Long ago , I dropped the double moniker given to me by my Francophile father . If you would only straighten up , Marie Claude . My mother , who carried her breasts high as an endowment of the gods , could not bear my schoolgirl slump , the downward cast of my weak eyes . Molly Montour , ne Baird , did not live to see the fashion for narrow-chested scrawn and scholarly glasses . She would have taken little pleasure in her daughter pecking at the edges of academic conferences . You do see that I have been a determined disappointment . But lately , there 's this dear , deluded man , who transforms schoolmarm into sprite , sees me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high round room , prison or primal palace , that my mother 's thought turned to in the end . And if he does not come , Molls , I will have lived in your leaky tower at last , launched a paper missile , the frail trajectory of my story . TOTAL NETWORKING IN THE ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE You may wonder how we met , your daughter and this serious man who often travels with a State Department visa , who may be seen with glib television pundits mourning the slippage of whole banking systems into default . How does a player of that mark tie up with the little brown wren ? Hans Green arrived at the community college where I teach without escort . An urban campus surrounded by parking lots half empty in the lull between day and night classes . He found his way through the crisscross of walks , not a scrap of the red carpet he was accustomed to , the welcome of deans , provosts , Nobel economists . Skidding cross campus , he headed toward the dowdiest building , figuring some authority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our administration . In our muddled architecture you can read a history of public educationWPA moderno , Fifties Bauhaus bunker , glass box of the Sixties , Post modern student center with its giddy , gaudy references coming full-circle to colonial revival . Teachers ' to junior to community college . In the empty hall of the administration building , Gruen encountered himself on a Xeroxed flier the color of bubble gum , his flesh pixelated grey , hair rubbery , a case of pinkeye . The title of his lecture alarming : " Total Networking in the Entrepreneurial Culture . " What the hell did that mean ? This gig put on his calendar by an intern from the Kennedy School , a fast-tracker who made it known he was overqualified for the Summer job . Hans Gruen was booked months ahead . Perhaps this trip to the inner city foretold grazing pastures to come . As his name reached the upper limits of the Foundation stationery , might he be eased off the tougher assignments ? Goodwill missions to such modest campus settings were the duty of junior officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full . Next week he would be back in West Africa , check the program investigating the managerial impact of transnational corporations . The poster informed him that he was an hour early . An hour of Hans ' time is cosily . No one about , he read notices of career opportunities for specialized skills , workaday jobs a good distance from entrepreneurial . Later , he would tell me he 'd thought to speak to the students about his recent travels in Africa , bring them up to date on the poverty problemcall the selfish man , homo economicus , into account . What models do we press upon the post-colonial world with our aid , material goods versus quality of life ? That sort of thing . What cultures lie beyond the extended instructional reach ? This lecture played well in small liberal arts colleges , but Hans had little knowledge of my students , decent kids aiming to enter a world of commerce more parochial than global . His distinction between patronage and the spirit of contemporary philanthropy would mean little to them . He looped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility in the West , networking , for it was always a trustee of the Foundation who pressed him to visit elite venues where a son or daughter ... Why would students at this blue collar school receive the Foundation 's lofty agenda , the support of good causes in hopes that the state , if there exists a responsible state , will take on population control , the gas line , clean water ? Money laid out for distant , unpredictable profits . Eerie , the empty hallway , scuffed walls of institutional cream , many doors , shadowy figures moving behind frosted glass in a dumb show . Gruen succumbed to panic , the sudden divestment of his purpose , of himself as the rosy pretender on the poster . For a mere five minutes out of time , his precious time , he loitered on the stained industrial carpet . In a disturbing projection not new to him , he saw himself apart , as though on a screen . Out-of-body , the spiritual fakirs call it , as though his lethargy in the blasting steam heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gruen , a boy dead to all feeling , hiding in the dark , a scene that faded quickly as in a movie land dissolve . Later , he would tell me that lost memory was like capital never recovered . But on the day of this misadventure at our humble campus , his hosts came upon him with elaborate apologies . Hans returned to the reality he was cast in . Inaccurately introduced : his years at the World Bank overlapping his run at UNESCO . A conference table , no students . Apparently he was to hold forth for the edification of the faculty and their colleagues at neighboring institutions . The young scholar in Trotsky beard and glasses who muddled the introduction had cribbed " Total Networking in the blah , blah , blah " from the annual report of the Foundation . Hans so blind to home grown pomposity , he had n't recalled the invention of an illustrated page on which liberating computer screens circled a classroom of sub-Saharan students ( many of them now dead of starvation ) . I sat doodling at the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disguised in a floppy black sweater that swallowed me up , Gruen sensed I did n't belong , a kid too wise for my years , smiling at my colleague 's tedious bid for his day in the sun as darkness fell on the obscure campus . I worried the spikes of my elfin hair . If you would only soften , wash and curl , Marie Claude ... Doodling at the conference table , I was bored , bored as Hans Gruen had been the previous weekend watching the pre-game show to the Super Bowl in a hotel room , popping a can of beer from the hospitality bar . You 'd like us to move on to the Hyatt , to the neutral bed hastily rented ? But Hans first set eyes on your daughter in a classroom where he scrapped his encouraging talk for privileged youngsters to instruct needy academics on valid technologies replicable across multiple constituencies , his words airy as bubbles stretched thin . Let us take African initiatives , Zimbabwe . Let us take free markets as opposed to an agriculture of protectionism . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle . Gruen had an easy sell with this crowd , delivering applied economics , fancy pants experiments in hope more uncertain than the answers to the weekly quiz I give my classes . Now he directed his words to the little woman in black with the wry smile . I was n't buying . The Hyatt ? First the dull reception where Hans Gruen caught my name with the French spin on Montour I was trained to . He would have caught at any favor . " Montour ? " He had known my father , of course . In Brussels at a NATO conference ? Perhaps earlier ? The Paris years . In any ease the honored guest escaped the wine and cheese post-mortems with me , not rudely , for did n't we know how to duck out ? Diplomacy in our bloodlines . And the networking left behind , when it came down to it , was in-house academic , career opportunities in the tristate area , a limited constituency . ( Continues ... )             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
