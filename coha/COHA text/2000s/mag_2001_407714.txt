<p> " Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast , " wrote William Congreve in The Mourning Bride . But Keats ' words may be more fitting here : " Heard melodies are sweet , but those unheard/Are sweeter . " <p> The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said , " Without music , would be a mistake . " And a sign on a music store door has added , " Bach in an hour . Offenbach sooner . " <p> Between the two lies an inviting gap , which our cover artists will fill . <p> Thus we see a boy giving his all , puffing on a horn . Another boy in snorkeling gear is so eager for his piano lesson he did n't take time to change ( in a pig 's eye ) . A third boy saws away on a violin as if he might be thinking of ramming his bow into the ear of the girl on his left at orchestra practice . <p> Among adults , we see a soprano blasting the ears off a male quartet who might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop considering how to maneuver his overgrown bass viol into the bus . Should he succeed , we wonder how many passengers he might decapitate when moving to the rear . <p> And if you 'd like to relive a scene from your childhood , it 's supplied by a stoutish gentleman adorned in marching-band regalia , risking what could be his final breath on a heart-threatening horn . ( Upon close observation , the slide trombone on his left has to be six feet long . ) <p> As for the singing telegraph operator , perhaps it 's best to let some great inventions of the past simply slip away . <p> Who can look at this poor lad without thinking of these lines from Browning : " His soul with song , or , haply mute/Blows out his brains upon the flute " ? Change the mute to " lump it " and flute to " trumpet , " and we 've got it . <p> Remember Lewis Carroll 's " He thought he saw a Banker 's Clerk/Descending from the bus/He looked again , and found it was/A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have to pull a few strings to get his violin with the thyroid condition aboard . And he may be in for some discords while working his way to the rear . <p> This boy was called in by his mother for the weekly piano lesson , a bust of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart  --  who was playing minuets on the family harpsichord at age four  --  for inspiration . Chances are that this future Carnegie Hall star is not thumping out " Happy Days Are Here Again . " Our guess would be more like " You 're the Only Thing That 's Rising in the Sour Dough of Life . " And if the kid thinks life is sour now , wait till his mother spots the wet towel draped across her beloved piano . <p> Put " That Old Gang of Mine " in the same room with a piano and a pretty girl at the keys , and it wo n't be long before " The Music Goes ' Round and ' Round . " In some cases , however , as Christina Rossetti once noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially when a female songbird with oversize lungs contributes so many decibels that even Beethoven winces from the vibrations . It 's also clear that the disgruntled quartet would prefer she cut loose with " Show Me the Way to Go Home " and then ' act on it . <p> The parents of little Charlie Caterwaul have launched him into music lessons . The reason he is not glow-eyed with interest is that he must practice half an hour a day and is now approaching his first five minutes . And from the grip on his bow , it 's obvious he would prefer swinging a baseball bat or spearing bullheads in the creek . How nice if he could only scratch around on something besides his fiddle and come up with the cash to buy his mother a set of earmuffs . <p> Artist Stevan Dohanos began work on this picture by borrowing all the equipment from his neighboring high-school band . " The tough job , " he said , " was keeping my guests , some who had n't laid a lip on a trombone in years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they had n't lost the old touch . " <p> As John Keats wrote to Fanny Keats , " Give me books , fruit , French wine and fine weather , and a little music out of doors , played by somebody I do not know . " As for all of his requests , the only one we have here is the out of doors . And even should Keats question the gentleman with the encircling horn , chances are that with his marching attire and puffed-out cheeks , recognition would n't be certain  --  unless those are the band member 's sons cheering him on . <p> " We are the music-makers/And we are the dreamers of dreams/ ... Yet we are the movers and shakers/Of the world for ever , it seems . " So wrote Arthur O'Shaughnessy . Not of this scene , for sure , but it would serve . Certainly the woman next door can anticipate her world shaking and moving when that drum and horn begin competing for vibrations . One might also ask why George Hughes did n't use his artistic license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No matter that this poor chap doomed to sing telegrams has forgotten his own wife 's birthday , gotten only a lousy necktie for Father 's Day , and presented flowers on the wrong anniversary date . Still he must put a lilt in his voice and convey bliss to the bosoms of those for whose ears he is paid to warble " Happy Whatever " into . We can only hope that by now he has a bit of lilt left upon arriving home and that his dear wife has perhaps exchanged the lousy tie for something less lousy . Boxer shorts decorated with hearts would be nice  --  or maybe a carton of throat lozenges . <p> By Maynard Good Stoddard <p>
