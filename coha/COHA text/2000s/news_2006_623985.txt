<p> The faded sign outside Kay 's Cafe in the city of Highland sports a cartoon caricature of a grinning chef holding a frying pan . <p> City officials , who use the drab yellow diner as a kind of impromptu town center , are looking a lot like the diminutive chef on the sign these days as they hold San Francisco 's feet to the fire . <p> The prod that woke this bedroom community at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains , whose 2005 population city officials estimate at 50,860 , was a decision by San Francisco voters to pass an advisory measure banning military recruiters from schools . <p> Calling San Franciscans a bunch of " kooks and nuts " and castigating supervisors for their " tomfoolery , " the City Council unanimously approved a resolution " prohibiting the expenditure of city funds for attending conferences , training seminars and/or workshops to be held in the City of San Francisco . " <p> It was a bold move for a city that is virtually unknown outside of San Bernardino County , but it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> San Francisco Supervisors fanned the flames of middle American contempt for the city by the bay with talk about impeaching President Bush . Then Supervisor Gerardo Sandoval opened the floodgates of national ridicule this past week on the " Hannity &; Colmes " show on Fox News when he said the United States should not have a military . <p> That did it . San Francisco , itself , is being depicted by conservative talk radio hosts all over the nation as a place full of loonies . <p> Highland , meanwhile , has been thrust into the public eye . The city has n't gotten this much press , according to City Manager Sam Racadio , since 1992 , when the city offices were temporarily moved into a building historically occupied by a mortuary . <p> Highland officials are eagerly passing out to the media , and anyone else interested , copies of e-mails they 've received from people all over the country , many expressing support for their position . <p> San Francisco 's government " is full of a bunch of whacked-out liberals , " shrieks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commends Highland for boycotting " this city of derelicts , drug addicts and ultra-left-wing liberals " who should be " quarantined so ( their disease ) does n't have a chance to infect any of our other cities . " <p> Getting into the spirit of things , City Councilman Larry McCallon railed against San Francisco last week for sins including a lack of support for traditional marriage , family , the Bush administration and the military , if not God himself . <p> " I was raised in Kentucky and everybody all over that area calls California ' the land of the kooks and nuts ' or ' the left coast ' because of the things that happen in San Francisco , " said McCallon , the retired owner of a laundry chain who does Baptist missionary work in his spare time . " There are a lot of people up there who have some weird ideas , who are extreme in their views . " <p> San Francisco city officials have tried to shrug off the fiery rhetoric as the jealous rantings of extremists . Mayor Gavin Newsom referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and implied that they are out of touch with their constituencies . <p> " It is San Bernardino , after all , " said Supervisor Tom Ammiano , adding that anti-gay protesters greeted him the last time he was in that county , about 10 years ago . " They 're welcome to join us in the 21st century whenever they are ready . " <p> It appears , nevertheless , that Highland is the community with the most to gain in this David and Goliath battle . <p> The community , once home to the Serranos Indians , was once one of the best orange growing regions in the world . The first oranges were planted there in 1859 . By 1920 , there were 3,500 acres of citrus in the area , which became known as the Highland Citrus Belt . <p> Highland was famous for its delicious navel oranges that were shipped around the world under the brand name Gold Buckle . <p> But by 1950 , agriculture in the region was in serious decline . Highland 's last great orange grove was sold in 1980 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like many suburbs , a flat monotonous expanse of mostly tract homes . Highland 's busiest streets are a collection of auto shops , nail salons , diners and discount shops . <p> The closure of the Norton Air Force Base in 1991 was a major blow to the region , costing 10,000 jobs . City officials have worked hard since then trying to build Highland up as a good place for businesses to set up shop . <p> The passage of Measure I in San Francisco stuck in the craw of the many Air Force retirees living in Highland . The City Council first learned about San Francisco 's stance against military recruiters after the infamous outburst by Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly . O'Reilly suggested after the vote that the rest of the nation should ignore an al Qaeda terrorist attack on Coit Tower . <p> " You want to be your own country ? " he taunted . " Go right ahead . " <p> Still , the imbroglio has had little effect on the regulars at the old Bella Highland Cafe and Bar , a crumbling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The " Bell , " as it is known to regulars , is one of the few remaining businesses in the historic downtown , a dusty collection of frontier-style wood , brick and stone buildings , some stuccoed over or boarded up . Bartender Kasey Glover said she had n't even heard of the spat with San Francisco and does n't much care . <p> " I 've never been there , " she said as she poured a morning beer for a tattooed patron . " I hear it 's always cold there . " <p> Most of the patrons and employees at Kay 's one recent day said they supported the military but have nothing against San Francisco . <p> " I think they should allow recruiters on campuses , but I still like the town , " said Linda Sparrow , 50 , a waitress at Kay 's and a longtime resident of Highland . " It 's a pretty town , and it 's fun to go visit .

" It 's another Vietnam War . People are over there just dying for nothing and we 're not taking care of anything over here in the United States . San Francisco is right . " <p> Although most Highland city employees were supportive of the resolution , several confessed to being perplexed by the position of the Highland City Council . <p> " I like San Francisco , " said one woman who works on real estate projects with the city and feared retribution if she openly expressed her opinion , " but do n't tell anyone I said that .
