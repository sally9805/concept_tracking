Chapter One I 'm from Chicago originally . I went to New York , married a girl named Anne , and was in the middle of living happily ever after when something happened . I did n't know what it was , and if you would have asked me at the time I would have said nothing , that nothing was happening , because for me nothing was . I was standing in a convenience store next to a gas station along a picturesque parkway in New Jersey . I was perusing the assorted candies and snacks , debating with myself what to bring back to Anne . She was waiting in the car . We were driving to her mother 's house and I was probably reading the labels , looking for something nutritious to eat . Although it was n't a dream , the unnatural light of the convenience store made it seem as if I was existing in the world of a dream , the main difference being that , unlike a dreamworld , in this world , the convenience store world , nothing much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all happening , I just was n't seeing it . I was n't seeing it because my attention was absorbed by walls of refrigerated cases and the aisles of bright displays . I was concentrating on all the possible choices , which , after a while , I 'd narrowed down to a thin pack of peanuts , a protein-style candy bar , and a so-called energy drink . When I paid the cashier I did n't notice the rings on the woman 's fingers , and I did n't count my change . When I walked to the door I did n't notice the grease stains on the square brown tiles or the sky which was blue through the window . When I walked outside , back to the car , all I noticed was that the car was gone . * * * This is a story of a man who ... I wo n't say I was never stuck , but I was good at making adjustments . That was my specialty , adjusting to circumstances-I prided myself on this ability-and so the first thing I did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly appear . And when she did n't appear I began looking for her . She had to be somewhere , in some part of this service station area , and because there were only a limited number of places she could be , I kept looking in those places . I expected to see her , either waiting for gas or putting air in the tires or parked in the lot behind the small store . Although I did n't actually see her in any of the places she ought to be , I knew she was there in one of them , and that in my mind I was making a mistake , that fatigue or oversight or an optical illusion was keeping me from seeing what must be right in front of me . According to our plan Anne would be filling the car with gas and I would be buying some treats for the road , for our journey to Nyack , north of New York City . New York City was where we lived , in a house in Brooklyn , and we were driving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking the car , or had parked it , and was waiting for me in the parking area behind the store . But she was n't there . The service station compound was not that big , and as I walked the length of it and took an inventory of every car , I could see that our car , our little maroon station wagon , was n't getting gas and it was n't getting air and it was n't waiting in the parking area . Something was happening . I wanted nothing to be happening . I wanted not to be nervous and worried , and although I was worried , I tried to keep that worry safely below consciousness . Which was n't easy . To keep it there I had to assume certain things . I had to assume that Anne was having trouble with the car and had needed to keep the engine running , that she 'd gone ahead and would soon be returning . Although this did n't make much sense , I was willing to believe it . I was eager , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , then it was some alternative , and I did n't want to think too hard about any alternative because I wanted her back . I wanted the car to be where it ought to be and I 'd just overlooked it . There it is , I wanted to say . No problem , I wanted to say , but it was n't the case . The car was gone and so was Anne . I could tell I was upset because my heart was pounding against my chest ; for me , that 's always an indication . Also , there was the fact that I was cursing her , cursing , and at the same time praying for her safety . She would n't just leave me like that or forget me . That would be impossible . And yet if I let myself think about what might have happened ... But I did n't do that . I should say , I did n't want to do that , because how could I not ? How could I not imagine that some man with a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , forced her to drive to some remote area off the road , some trees and a picnic table , and to lie on the picnic table , and she was wearing jeans , I could picture them , and her running shoes , and so the pounding of my heart was fear . I loved her and I was afraid . And yet at the same time if she was taking a little side trip to buy some ... whatever , some film or some ... sushi or something and she 's , not raped , but safe and happy-although I wanted her to be safe and happy-I would be angry and was going to be angry , but at the moment I was confused , partly because I loved her and partly because I did n't want to feel the thing I was feeling . Since I 'd left my cell phone in the car I used a pay phone by the air supply to call , first her cell phone and then mine , but either they were n't turned on or they were n't working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gas station , literally on the edge of a galvanized metal railing , watching the procession of cars pulling up to the attendants in blue uniforms . There was never really a lull in the stream of cars , but during a relative lull I walked to one of the attendants and asked the man if he 'd seen a maroon-colored station wagon , or a dark red station wagon , but the man , naturally , could n't remember any one specific car . And not only that , he did n't speak much English . But he wanted to be helpful , so he called over a colleague who , although he seemed more in charge , had even less facility with the English language , which was my language . And because I thought I knew a little Spanish I tried to speak , about un carro con una seorita . Buscando por la seorita , I said , and the second man , who according to his shirt was named Ramon , after consulting with the other attendants , and after some gesturing-all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . Something muy malo . And although I did n't want to bear about anything muy , malo . I said , Qu pasa , which means , roughly , " What is happening , " not because I could n't feel what was happening to me , but because it was the only way I knew to ask what had happened , to my wife . Something had happened , that much I could translate . I could n't be sure what it was , or how it happened , or who it had happened to , only that it seemed to involve several people and a couple of cars . I believed the men were probably telling the truth , but it was n't my truth , and certainly not a truth about Anne . They were describing some other situation . There were millions of women in the world , and as the attendants were indicating the height of this specific seorita , and saying that moreno ( which means brown ) was the color of her hair , it was clear they were saying that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , but no more of what ? I did n't know . I was saying to them , and to myself , No problema , no problema , but the men were shaking their heads as if there was a problema , a gran problema , and I was backing away , thanking them and nodding , trusting that the whole communication process was impeded by the excitement of the retelling , or by the impatient honking of the cars waiting for gas , or by the language barrier ; somehow in the gap between us the message had been scrambled , and I was getting the whole thing wrong . All I could think to do was wait . Anne could be impulsive , and the waiting itself was an attempt to preserve the illusion that nothing substantial had happened . I sat on the metal guardrail , trying to find the padding in my buttocks , watching the cars , one after the other , car after car , and by now it was afternoon . It was n't afternoon before , but now it was , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all during that whole time I was still expecting Anne to pull up any minute , waving and smiling and ready to go . I drank my drink , ate the peanuts and the candy bar , and tried to adjust . I tried to banish the unpleasant thoughts I was having . And I did , to some extent . I noticed the trees , for instance , and the slow sway of their branches . I tried to fill my mind with the small moments that together comprised what I thought of as beauty . The clouds in the darkening sky and the cool breeze ... And I was able in this way to find a modicum of that beauty . Some . A little modicum , if that 's possible . But it was n't enough to dull my agitation . And because I was still agitated , I decided to take action . Action begins with intention , intention leads to decision , and as the sun sank lower into the sky I decided it was getting late . I called Anne 's mother ( no answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I called Anne 's cell phone one more time and then decided to go home , saving my reaction to what was happening for later . Chapter Two I walked back through trees and rocks , along a trail overlooking the Hudson River . I walked across the river , on the George Washington Bridge , and about halfway across I stood , with the wind and the sky and the sun going down , leaning against the railing of the bridge , looking down to the water and the patterns in the water . I was following with my eyes the current of the river when a man took a spot on the railing about an arm 's length away from me . The span of the bridge was enormous and in that entire expanse the man chose to stand close enough so that if I wanted to , I could reach out and touch the man . Which seemed to signal a desire , on his part , to engage in some form of interaction . But when I looked at the man , in his windbreaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look away , out to the distant spires of the mettlesome city . To normalize the situation , or to normalize my own discomfort , I began talking to the man , mentioning conversationally that I 'd lost my car , telling him about the gas station and about Anne 's disappearance . I did n't go into much detail but I had a desire to speak , so I did . " I ca n't find my wife , " I said , but the man did n't look up . Or rather , he did look up , but his look did n't acknowledge me . I could n't tell if that look was directed at me , or at something beyond me , something in the soft hills of New Jersey . And because I wanted to create some fellow feeling I turned and surveyed those same hills , and when I could n't determine what part of the landscape he found so compelling I turned back . The man was staring , not so much at me as through me , so that I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen through . And it was n't that I was afraid of the man ; if you had asked me I would never have mentioned fear . But I was afraid . Of my own transparency . What was unbearable was to not exist , and although I knew I existed , I attempted to prove that existence , to get some acknowledgment from the man that his world and my world were at least a little synonymous . But before that could happen , the man , in his khaki slacks and yellow jacket , started walking , and he continued walking , past me and along the pedestrian walkway . I wanted to stop him and say something about our common experience- " Nice view " or " Some river " - and in this way manufacture a degree of fellow feeling . But instead I straightened up , stepped away from the railing , turned , and walked back to New York City . I caught the subway to Brooklyn , walked down the tree-lined street to my house , and I could tell Anne was n't home because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought , she 's probably out shopping , at our local market , a co-op market , and I walked inside , turned on the lights , and waited for her to come home . I listened to a telephone message from Anne 's mother asking us to call her back , but I did n't call back , partly because Anne was the only person I wanted to talk to , and partly because I heard in her mother 's slightly distraught voice the desire to believe that everything was fine-thereby indicating that something was n't fine-and the hope that if she believed it enough , everything would be . Which was also what I was doing . I could accept the events that were happening as long as they meant what I wanted them to mean . While I waited for Anne to come walking in through the front door I tried to go about my normal life , to do what I normally would do , but I could n't remember what that was . I sat in my kitchen , our kitchen , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I thought was my old familiar chair , trying to find its familiarity . I sat in a variety of ways-legs crossed , legs spread , legs up on the arm of the chair-trying to find the familiar position that would restore my familiar life , so that I could then live it . I was waiting for normalcy to return , and not just waiting , I was searching for that normalcy , and so I walked upstairs and went to sleep . I should say I went to bed , because sleep never came . I lay in bed , naked and slightly cold , the blue comforter pulled up to my neck , eyes wide open , staring at the uneven ceiling . And Anne did not come home . That night I woke , not from a dream , because I was n't sleeping , but it was like a dream . In my mind I could clearly see a man-actually several people , men and women-getting into a car , my car , and driving away . I did n't know who they were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wide awake , I could see them . All night I watched a variety of permutations on the same basic story , a repetitious sampling of various people forcing themselves into the car , forcing Anne into the back seat or the front seat , and then the car driving off . To change these images , or control them , I tried to imagine a scene in which Anne uses some arcane martial art to subdue her assailants . When other thoughts intruded I pushed them away , fighting the unwelcome thoughts , trying to maintain the thoughts I wanted , the thoughts of Anne 's superior power and cunning . These positive thoughts , however , were constantly shifting and moving , running ahead of me and getting away from me . I was chasing , in my mind , the images I wanted to see , and at the same time avoiding the unbidden images that were coming after me . And eventually catching me . By morning I 'd seen the scene , or thought it , so many times it became embedded into my reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the upstairs front room , which was my room .
