This year , more young women will have a stroke than breast cancer and AIDS combined . Do n't be one of them <p> ONE MARCH EVENING in 1996 , Cristina Rice  --  then a senior at Meredith College in Raleigh , NC  --  was jogging with a classmate through the humid , southern twilight . " I wanted to fit into my bikini , " she says . " Spring break started the next day . " But a sudden , heavy tiredness cut her run short . <p> " We went back to my friend 's house . She offered me water , but the glass fell out of my hand , " says Rice , now 29 . " It crashed and splintered on the floor . When I tried to apologize , my words were slurred . " Rice  --  a healthy young woman who had never smoked a cigarette , used recreational drugs , or had more than two or three drinks in a week  --  was having a stroke . She was 21 . <p> No one called for help . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I tried to talk , it did n't come out right , " she says . " I just thought I needed sleep . " Rice got into her car and drove home  --  alone . " I tried to read street signs out loud , but the sounds I made were gibberish . " The stroke grew more intense . " At home , I had the worst headache of my life . I called my mother , who was 4 hours away . " Alarmed , her mom called a nearby family friend , who rushed Rice to the hospital . <p> Even in the emergency room , no one realized what was happening . " The doctors and nurses asked me 20 different ways if I 'd taken cocaine , " Rice recalls . " They did n't believe me . Finally , after a CT scan , they diagnosed the stroke . But they did n't tell me or give me a drug to stop brain damage . They kept coming into my room , opening the curtain , looking at me , then walking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with her . " The doctor said , ' It appears you 've had a stroke , but we think we got the chart mixed up . You 're too young to have a stroke . " Bigger Than Breast Cancer <p> The doctor was wrong . Someone in America has stroke every 45 seconds . Like Rice , many ca n't believe it 's even happening . " There 's huge denial , especially in people under age 50 , " says neurologist Jeffrey Harris , MD , director of the stroke center at Huntsville Hospital in Alabama . " They 'll blame weird symptoms on arthritis or diabetes or fatigue  --  anything but stroke . And in younger women  --  and men  --  the denial is even stronger . They think , ' I 'm in picture-perfect health . There 's no way it can happen to me . " <p> This year , 120,000 women under 45 will have a stroke  --  far more than the number who will be diagnosed with breast cancer and HIV/AIDS combined . In all , more than 350,000 American women will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of disability among American women  --  and more than 100,000 will die . <p> Yet stroke has no pink ribbon , no symbol to remind us of the risk , to teach us to protect ourselves , or to remember the lives damaged or lost . Chances are , like many women , you do n't even think you 're at risk : In a recent joint survey of 9,929 Americans conducted by Prevention , Essence , and Woman 's Day magazines in collaboration with the American Stroke Association personal threat . <p> That 's a dangerous mistake , since file only way to protect yourself from stroke is to be aware of its risk factors and symptoms , so you can either prevent it or get fast brain-saving help if you have one . " Women need to realize this can happen to them , " says Rice , who survived her stroke with few lingering aftereffects . " I have a very slight droop on the right side of my face , but I 'm the only one who notices it , " she says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to be a Whiz with phone numbers ; now I use a PalmPilot . " She is now sales director for a Dallas software company . " If I 'd known the symptoms , if people around me had recognized what was happening , if the doctor in the emergency room had known , things would have worked out better for me . " How It Happens <p> Think of a stroke as a heart attack happening in your head . A clot blocks the blood supply . A tiny artery squeezes shut . <p> Or a blood vessel bursts . The result : Cells are starved of oxygen , destroying the gray matter crucial for speech , movement , thought , or any of the processes that keep you alive . <p> If you 're lucky , someone calls 911 fast , and an ambulance whisks you to an emergency room with a stroke response team . If you have a clot  --  responsible for 70 to 80% of strokes  --  and are diagnosed promptly , a clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) can dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Getting tPA can make the difference between death or severe disability and returning to a normal life . <p> But most stroke victims are not so fortunate . Many delay for hours before calling the ambulance . Fewer than 8% get tPA  --  because they did n't get to the hospital quickly , or their stroke was n't diagnosed soon enough , or the emergency room was n't equipped to give tPA . <p> Women may be at an extra disadvantage . An intriguing  --  and controversial  --  study from the University of Michigan finds that 62% of female stroke victims had nontraditional symptoms . Emergency medical crews and doctors trained to look for classic symptoms such as paralysis , slurred speech , and dizziness may miss female clues such as headaches , disorientation , and pain in the face , arms , or legs . This discovery may help explain an inequality : Women stroke victims wait longer in the emergency room and receive less treatment than men . <p> " Prompt recognition of nontraditional stroke symptoms may increase the number of women receiving clot-dissolving drugs and reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MD , now a stroke fellow at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston . <p> Women need to take responsibility as well . " There 's evidence that women are more aware of stroke symptoms than men , yet they take longer to call 911 and get to the emergency room for help , " says Steven J. Kittner , MD , director of the University of Maryland Brain Attack Center . " And if you do n't get help in time , stroke damage is far worse . " " I 'm Not Going to the Hospital " <p> Holly Schaefer had a stroke inside one of America 's top medical centers , the Mayo Clinic . " I 'd come with my husband to a doctor 's appointment , " she says . " Afterward , in the ladies room , my right hand stopped working . I could n't wash up at the sink . I shuffled out of the bathroom leaning to one side because my right leg was so weak . " <p> Confused , Schaefer walked out of the hospital  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . My husband had to fight to take me back to the emergency room . I kept saying ' I 'm not going to the hospital , ' but no words came out . I made noises like Aaah and Ohhh . In retrospect , I can see all the signs of a stroke , " she says . " At the time , I never imagined I was at risk . Why would I ? I was a mother ; I had a great job as a business systems engineer ; I was a vegetarian ; I was even training for my first marathon . " <p> It was the day before her 35th birthday . <p> In the emergency room , Schaefer managed to pass two neurological tests used to help diagnose potential strokes : She wrote her name and drew a picture of a clock face . " They decided it did n't add up to a stroke , despite my other symptoms . I think my ER doc had never seen someone so young having a stroke . He told me I needed a psychiatrist  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just gotten a brutal diagnosis : My husband , who had complications from a kidney transplant , now had a rare , untreatable virus . But I knew something else was happening to me . It was n't the stress . " <p> Eventually , Schaefer was admitted to the hospital . " They observed me for 24 hours , then gave me an MRI . It showed extensive stroke damage . " The right side of her body was paralyzed , her hand clutched tightly to her chest . She could say just six words . " If they had given me the clot-busting drug tPA right away , I probably would have less damage , " she says . <p> Nearly 4 years  --  and hundreds of hours of grueling therapy  --  later , Schaefer , 38 , is physically fine . " I can walk , ran , and gesture like a New Yorker , " she jokes . " I 'm lucky  --  no outward signs of my stroke . " Yet fully learning to speak ( and understand ) language again may take many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the radio or get my messages off the answering machine very well . I miss the nuances and get overwhelmed . " <p> The experience has rocked her life . " I 'm working 6 hours a week for my old company coordinating training programs . It 's a clerical position , but I 'm very lucky they were willing to keep me on and be flexible . " Schaefer is now divorced . " We split up 5 months after the stroke . It 's funny ; I took care of him for years after his kidney transplant , but when I got sick , the whole dynamic changed , " she says . <p> Her 8-year-old daughter , True , lives with her . And Schaefer has a boyfriend : a former North Dakota state legislator and highway patrolman who shares one of the central experiences in her life : He , too , had a stroke when young  --  at age 30 . <p> " It is a gross understatement to say simply that a stroke changes your life , " Schaefer says . " In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abilities are razed . And from the ground up , you must build a new life ; find new direction and focus ; discover new hopes , dreams , and plans ; and learn new abilities . " More Risks Than Men <p> High blood pressure , smoking , diabetes , high cholesterol , overweight , and heart- beat irregularities all raise stroke odds for both sexes . So do ministrokes ( also known as transient ischemic attacks , or TIAs ) , short , painless interruptions of bloodflow to the brain . <p> But a woman 's risk is further boosted by higher-dose oral contraceptives , combination hormone therapy , having frequent migraine headaches with an aura , and even  --  though very rarely  --  pregnancy . Combining risks further magnifies the odds . <p> " We ca n't give you a 100% guarantee that you 'll never have a stroke , " says Harris . " The good news is that you can minimize your risk astronomically by controlling your risk factors . That 's the message women need to hear . " Odd Little Moments <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she stood in a flower shop . How had she gotten there ? What should she order ? Roses ? Daisies ? Lilies ? Panicked , she ordered masses of flowers , bouquet after bouquet , then just as quickly asked for just one , please . " Suddenly I remembered . My daughter was in a school play , Li'l Abner . I wanted to get her some flowers , " recalls Hutton , now 54 , a former nurse from northern Minnesota . <p> Memory lapses . Numb , tingling arms . Subtle mental shifts . Hutton 's history of what she calls her " odd little moments " began at age 37 . And no one told her they were ministrokes or that having even one meant that she had a 30 to 40% chance of eventually having a full-blown stroke . <p> But after 5 years and dozens of those odd little moments , Hutton had two devastating strokes within 9 days , when she . was 42 years old . <p> " On June 9 , 1992 , the alarm went off , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very heavy . I speed-dialed the doctor , but my speech was very slurred and very staccato , as if I 'd had too much to drink . He told me to come to the ER right away . But I fell back asleep . The swelling in my brain made me forget about the call . " <p> Her 19-year-old daughter found her on the floor and took her to the hospital . After a day , brain scans revealed the damage . " I was aphasic  --  I lost the ability to bring words from my mind to my mouth . My left side was paralyzed . " When her second stroke happened 9 days later , doctors realized that a heart condition called atrial septal detect ( ASD )  --  a hole in the upper chambers of her heart  --  was causing tiny blood clots to travel to her brain . ( ASD increases the risk of stroke . The hole was later closed surgically . ) <p> " The day I moved one finger a centimeter across the bedsheet was a good one . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . After 9 weeks , she walked with a cane and returned home to her three teenage children . When official therapy stopped , she signed up for piano lessons and typing classes to retrain her paralyzed left hand . She walked regularly to rebuild her body and went back to college to rebuild her mind . At age 50 , she graduated with honors in English . <p> During her recovery , Hutton contacted Louis R. Caplan , MD , of Harvard Medical School , with questions about surviving a stroke . When Caplan learned that she was keeping a journal throughout her recovery , he asked to see it , which led them to collaborate and publish the book , Striking Back at Stroke . " Writing about stroke is one thing , but living with the deficits for the rest of your life is something else , " she says . " I 've been to the brink . I had to learn to live again .

Or Worse <p> Here 's how having more than one risk factor magnifies the chances for a stroke : TABLE <p> <p> Call 911 Now <p> If you or someone you 're with develops any of these stroke symptoms , call 911 immediately . Not sure ? " Call anyway . Do n't sit at home wondering about it , " says neurologist Jeffrey Harris , MD , director of the stroke center at Huntsville Hospital in Alabama . " Fast action could save you from brain damage  --  or even death .

QUIT SMOKING <p> Your risk : Six times higher than normal , if you smoke a pack a day <p> The stroke connection : Smokers have more fatty buildup in the carotid artery , the big blood vessel in the neck that carries blood to the brain . Blockages here are the number one cause of stroke in the US . Nicotine raises blood pressure . Smoking also thickens blood , making it more likely to clot . Within 5 years of quitting , all that extra risk is gone . <p> What works : Support therapy plus the antidepressant bupropion ; nicotine patches . For more strategies , log on to the American Lung Association 's Web site at www.lungusa.org . <p> 2 . CALM HIGH BLOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure is 135/85 or higher <p> The stroke connection : Pummeled by high-speed bloodflow , arteries in the brain thicken and even squeeze shut or rupture . High blood pressure also increases the risk for developing clot-producing plaque in artery walls . <p> What works : Half an hour of daily exercise , plus a low-salt , moderate-fat diet rich in produce , whole grains , and low-fat dairy . <p> 3 . LOWER YOUR CHOLESTEROL <p> Your risk : High LDLs and low HDLs both raise risk <p> The stroke connection : Out-of-whack cholesterol leads to more plaque in artery walls and more risk for blood clots . Total cholesterol of 225 or higher also raises the risk of fatal stroke in women under 55 . <p> What works : Follow the same healthy plan that lowers high blood pressure . <p> 4 . TRIM EXTRA POUNDS <p> Your risk : Being overweight raises a woman 's stroke risk 75% <p> The stroke connection : Overweight women were two to four times more likely to have high blood pressure , diabetes , and high cholesterol , all of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same healthy plan that lowers high blood pressure . <p> 5 . REVERSE SYNDROME X ( METABOLIC SYNDROME ) <p> Your risk : This metabolic problem doubles risk <p> The stroke connection : Syndrome X may boost stroke risk by encouraging the growth of plaque in artery walls and making plaques more likely to burst and form blood clots . <p> What works : Follow the same healthy plan that lowers high blood pressure . <p> 6 . CONTROL DIABETES <p> Your risk : Diabetes may quadruple risk <p> The stroke connection : Diabetes seems to boost stroke odds because it is associated with high blood pressure , obesity , and cholesterol abnormalities . <p> What works : Control weight , blood pressure , and cholesterol levels . Get active . <p> Women-Only Risks <p> ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES If you 're at higher-than-normal risk for stroke ( due to smoking , high blood pressure , or diabetes , for example ) , talk with your gynecologist . Consider a safer version , such as a progestin-only pill . <p> HORMONE THERAPY ( HT ) Hormone therapy does n't protect you from cardiovascular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . And if you have any risks for clotting  --  a family history , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , diabetes  --  do n't use HT to ease hot flashes or other menopause symptoms . <p> FREQUENT MIGRAINES WITH AN AURA British researchers recently found that having migraines at least once a month with an aura ( seeing bright lights , or other sensory disturbances ) increases stroke risk for women ( but not men ) ages 20 to 44 . Talk to your doctor about your overall stroke risk and how you can lower it . <p> PREGNANCY Stroke linked to pregnancy happens , but it 's rare . The better news : If you 've had a stroke as a young woman , pregnancy may be safer than experts once believed . " Doctors used to advise young stroke survivors against having babies , but that 's changed , " says Steven J. Kittner , MD , director of the University of Maryland Brain Attack Center . Recent studies suggest that a history of stroke does not raise the risk of stroke during pregnancy , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
