From twenty-eight thousand feet and ten miles out , southern Florida 's coastal lights appeared as a line of twinkling jewels that broadened and transmuted into a steady glow as landfall drew nearer . Shelby Cervosier , the twin-jet Cessna Citation 's only passenger , had begun to unwind during the flight from Haiti , but the reminder that she was minutes from being back in harm 's way knotted her chest and ignited a fire in her stomach . <p> The pilot , flying without a copilot , had invited Shelby to join him in the cockpit during the flight . " Almost there , " he said . " We need to go over the plan ? " <p> " I have it . When you stop the plane , I jump out and head for the largest hangar . A woman named Brenda will be waiting in a Dodge van . She 'll take me to a place where I can rent a car . " <p> He gave her a thumbs-up . " Runway lights reflect skyward , so the ground will be dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio , listened , talked again , and adjusted the autopilot . The engines ' shrill whine softened . " Air Traffic Control bought the oil-leak story . We 're cleared for an emergency landing . " <p> A cloud bank temporarily blocked their view . Then Shelby , sitting in the copilot 's seat , saw miles of lights but nothing that looked like an airport . " Where do we land ? " <p> " It 's a rural strip-no control tower . I trigger the lights with my radio . " The pilot changed frequencies and thumbed his microphone switch several times . In the distance , runway lights glowed and brightened . " I wo n't shut down the engines or turn off the landing lights , because we do n't want prying eyes to know you 're abandoning ship . Brenda will probably be sleeping . You 'll have to find her and knock on a window . " <p> " No problem . " Shelby 's throat tightened so that she could barely get the words out . " Chuck , I 'm so afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't sweat it . When I park , I 'll make a brief exit and-never mind . The point is , by the time Customs gets here , my starboard engine will be leaking oil worse than the Exxon Valdez . " He patted her hand . " E-mail me when you 've snatched your little sister and found a hideout . Now , you ought to go back to the cabin and buckle yourself in . " <p> * * * <p> Lights on the ground grew brighter and more distinct . The Citation 's wheels kissed the runway with a muted screech . At the end of its landing roll , the plane reversed direction and lurched to a stop . Chuck wriggled out of the pilot 's seat and pulled a lever to open the cabin door . " Steps are going down . Good luck , beautiful . " <p> Shelby barely cleared the edge of the runway before the sleek little jet 's twin engines wound up to an ear-achy whine and it began moving , leaving behind a smelly residue of burned jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ; they made the ground a dark void . With every step , roots , ruts , and weeds threatened Shelby 's balance . Something-palmetto fronds , she guessed-whipped her legs . <p> When distance rendered the lights less blinding , she picked up her pace . Cloying heat and humidity plastered her T-shirt and jeans to her skin as she jogged across the rugged turf with her blue canvas overnight bag slung over a shoulder . <p> Look for a Dodge van , Chuck had said , but what if it was n't there ? Maybe she could hibernate until daylight and flag someone down . One way or another , get to a car rental agency , drive to Homestead , and sneak Carmen away . <p> As she approached the hangars , she slowed her pace . Wiping at sweat that stung her eyes and breathing hard from exertion , she looked for the woman who was supposed to meet her . With solid cloud cover blocking the moon , she almost bumped into the van before she recognized it . <p> Chuck had guessed wrong about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passenger door . " Welcome to Florida . " <p> Shelby climbed in . " Brenda , right ? " <p> " Not really . " The old Dodge Caravan 's dome light revealed an overweight , middle-aged woman with freckled , sun-leathered skin and unruly blond hair . " Chuck said not to use my real name , in case the feds nab me . " She cranked the engine and pulled away from the hangar . " You lean on back , catch some shut-eye . We 'll be on the road at least an hour , and your butt 's got ta be draggin ' . " <p> Shelby reclined the seat and closed her eyes . She was too keyed up to sleep , but God , she was tired . Tired of running . Tired of hiding . Tired of being scared . <p> * * * <p> As dawn turned low-hanging clouds a deep purple , the women found a car rental agency open for business near Fort Myers . Shelby rented a midsized Chevrolet . The charge to her credit card would reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then anyway . She said good-bye to Brenda and , five hours later , with heavy eyelids and cramping shoulder muscles , parked the Chevy at a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Homestead 's outskirts . After lunch , she drove to the suburban tract house where the Caribbean Basin Task Force-the CBTF-had kept her and her little sister for two weeks before sending Shelby on the mission that was supposed to win them political asylum . <p> Since Krystal Erinyes , her CBTF controller , had expected that she would not survive , they might have shut the place down and moved Carmen . If her sister was no longer there , Shelby had no idea what to do . <p> One step at a time , she reminded herself . Do n't panic and ruin your only chance . <p> She parked in the shade of a pine tree where she could see anyone entering or leaving the house . Carmen , if she was still there , would stay inside during the mid-day heat , and waiting for the air to cool enough for her to play outside was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Krystal , and she would send someone to stake out the house-if they were still using it . But if I go in , I might walk into a trap . <p> With the car windows open and the seat tilted back , Shelby watched and waited until worry that they had moved Carmen became intolerable . When the bellow of traffic on a nearby freeway signalled the afternoon rush hour , she slipped out of the car and walked to the house 's side yard , where shrubs hid her from its windows . Nothing about the run-down bungalow had changed during the three weeks she 'd been away . The same stench wafted from garbage cans left to cook under the broiling sun , the grass and shrubs still needed cutting and trimming , and the storm-damaged siding still needed repair . She could even be slapping at the same mosquitoes as she waited and prayed that her sister would come out . <p> Still no movement , no sign of occupancy . They must have moved , closed the house , and-wait , someone was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sprinted to the swing and slide set in the rear yard . <p> With her heart in her throat , Shelby watched her little sister struggle to climb up the slick metal slide . Barefooted , Carmen wore blue shorts and the pink , blue , and green tie-dyed T-shirt Shelby had helped her pick out at a street fair . Way too big , the shirt made the child 's undersized seven-year-old body look even smaller . <p> Shelby stepped from behind the shrubs . " Carmen , " she called softly , and held a finger to her lips . <p> " Shelby , " Carmen yelped as she ran to her . <p> Squatting , Shelby pulled her close . " We have to be quiet . We need to- " <p> Lois , the woman assigned to watch Carmen , stepped onto the back porch . Shading her eyes from the sun with a hand , she stared at Shelby . " What are you doing here ? " <p> As the woman approached , Shelby squelched an impulse to grab Carmen and dash for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't outrun the CBTF agent . Standing , she flashed what she hoped was a disarming smile . <p> Carmen tugged at her fingers . " Let 's run . " <p> Squeezing her sister 's hand with gentle pressure , Shelby kept her eyes focused on Lois and the smile pasted on her face . Stay calm . Brazen it through . " I finished my job early . Thought I 'd surprise you . " <p> " It 's a surprise , all right . " Lois snatched Carmen 's hand from Shelby 's . " Come inside , child . " <p> Carmen tried to jerk away . Then she dug in her heels . Lois , acting as if she did n't notice , dragged her . <p> Shelby followed but paused for a moment at the door , worrying about who might be in the house . With thudding heart and tense muscles , she pushed inside . <p> Lois walked through the kitchen into the front hallway . She picked up a telephone . <p> " Do n't do that , " Shelby said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers on the hook . <p> Lois studied her , letting seconds tick away . Then she pulled a short-barreled , silver pistol from a drawer . " You 're not supposed to be here . " She handled the weapon with an ease that bespoke competence . " Sit on the couch while I check this out . " <p> Better to die fighting , Shelby decided , than to let them take her somewhere and execute her . Putting on a perplexed expression , she looked over Lois 's shoulder . " Krystal ? What are you ... ? " <p> Lois 's gaze shifted for a blink , and Shelby slammed a shoulder into the shorter , heavier woman . Years of daily swimming and tennis had made Shelby strong and fast , and desperation gave her added strength . Gripping Lois 's gun hand , she crowded the woman . <p> They bounced off a wall . Lois staggered but recovered . She butted Shelby and tried to twist free . <p> Near panic , Shelby clamped her teeth on the hand that held the gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fist into the side of Shelby 's head . <p> Dust motes seemed to cluster before Shelby 's eyes , blocking the light . Her legs turned rubbery . Hang on , an inner voice commanded . Biting down on the fleshy wedge between Lois 's thumb and forefinger , she leaned against the woman to keep from falling . <p> Lois wrenched her hand free but lost her grip on the pistol . She kneed Shelby 's groin , punched her stomach . <p> Lightning flashed inside Shelby 's head . She fell to her knees and braced a hand against the wall . She retched and could not inhale . A dark curtain of despair descended upon her . <p> " Little bitch , " Lois shouted . <p> Carmen had wrapped both arms around the woman 's leg and clamped her teeth on flesh just below the hemline of the woman 's skirt . Lois kicked , but Carmen hung on . <p> Shelby realized she had fallen on the errant pistol . She grasped it and twisted to sit with her back against the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll shoot , " she croaked . " I 'll shoot you . " <p> Lois , concentrating on dislodging Carmen , did n't seem to hear . <p> Holding the pistol with both hands and praying that it had no safety device to keep it from firing , Shelby pointed it at the ceiling . With her eyes closed , she squeezed the trigger , flinching as the explosion reverberated through the hallway . <p> Carmen rolled away from Lois and protected her head with her arms . <p> Lois froze . " Put the gun down , " she said . <p> Shelby pointed it at her . " You back up . Back up ! " <p> Moving slowly , Lois backed to the wall . " Take it easy . We do n't need this . Relax , now . " <p> " Like hell , relax ! Carmen , are you all right ? " <p> " Let 's run , " Carmen said again . On her feet now , she stood by the door , jogging in place . Her cinnamon-hued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're leaving , sweetie . " How loud had the gunshot sounded from the street ? Most nearby residents would be at work or school , and in this neighborhood people usually minded their own business , but someone still might call the police . " We have to do something about Lois . " <p> " You do n't have to do anything with me , " Lois said . " They do n't pay me enough for this . " <p> Shelby studied the woman . Can I pull the trigger ? Look her in the eyes and shoot her ? " You kicked my sister . " <p> " To keep her from gnawing my leg off . I did n't hurt her . " Lois raised her hands , palms forward . " Why do n't you take your finger off that trigger ? We do n't want an accident . " <p> " You be still . " Keeping the handgun centered on the woman , Shelby struggled to her feet . Pain lanced through her groin . Her stomach churned . " Carmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kite ? " Carmen seemed disoriented . " Upstairs . " <p> " Run and get the ball of string from it . Hurry . " <p> Fighting the primal urge to flee , Shelby marched Lois into the half bath off the hallway and made her lie on her back . Keeping distance between them , she twisted three strands of the kite string together to increase its strength . A loop with a drawstring formed a miniature lariat , which she tossed to Lois . " Put that over your wrists . " <p> Fixing Shelby with a poisonous glare , Lois obeyed . <p> Still keeping her distance , Shelby drew the loop tight . " Get on your knees with your back to me . Raise your arms and put your wrists behind your head . " She approached from behind and , with the pistol digging into Lois 's back , wrapped the string around the woman 's neck so that she could not move her bound wrists . " Stand up facing the toilet . Now , straddle it and sit . " Confident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistol aside and tied her to the toilet , using the entire ball of string . As an extra precaution , she also used the cords from a hair dryer and a curling iron . Adhesive tape from the medicine cabinet sealed the woman 's mouth . " They 'll find you when they come looking for me . " <p> Carmen waited in the hallway , poised to run out the front door . Both her arms hugged Snaggly , an orange-haired , snaggletoothed rag-doll clown that had been Shelby 's gift to her when they moved into the house . <p> Shelby pushed the short-barreled pistol under the waistband of her jeans and pulled the tail of her T-shirt over it . " Let 's go out the back , sweetheart . Do n't run . We must n't attract attention . " <p> * * * <p> As they left Homestead behind , motoring north along Florida 's east coast , Shelby felt the knot in her stomach melting . She twisted and rotated her shoulders and neck to relax taut muscles . They had been traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . <p> " Somewhere far away , " Shelby said . <p> " To hide from Lois ? " <p> " From everybody . We 're starting new lives . " <p> Shelby 's description of their destination- somewhere far away - seemed to hang in the air , mocking her as she drove . Somewhere in this vast country there had to be a sanctuary , but where ? <p> Arizona , she decided : Phoenix . She knew something about that city from when she had done graduate work at Arizona State University , knew she and Carmen would be inconspicuous among the ethnically diverse population there . <p> Carmen 's voice , soft and grave , cut into her thoughts . " I knew you 'd come back for me . " " I promised , did n't I ? " <p> " Lois said you would n't . She said you were gone for good . Said brats like me belong in an instit ... In a place where they lock kids up . " <p> Reaching across the seat , Shelby caressed her little sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did fail to come back , it would n't be on purpose . I would never leave you on purpose . " <p> " I thought she was going to shoot you . " <p> " She might have if you had n't grabbed her . You saved my life . " <p> Carmen beamed . " She said people like me ... that people with dark skin are a bad thing . Said we have too many babies and do n't want to work . " <p> Shelby took a deep breath . How did you explain bigotry to a seven-year-old ? " Sweetie , do you know what ancestors are ? " <p> " Sure , they 're the ones that came before us . Grandma 's gran and her mama and papa and their grans . Like that . " <p> " Good , that 's exactly right . And your skin color depends on where those ancestors lived . If they came from places where it 's warm all the time and the sun shines every day , God gave them dark skin so they would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cloudy places , he gave them less color so they could get enough sun . That 's the only difference . " <p> " You do n't have much color . " <p> " Because my mother 's ancestors came from one of those cloudy places . But our father gave me some color , and I 'm grateful for that . " <p> " That 's why we 're sisters . " <p> Shelby caressed her again . " And because we 're sisters , I 'll always take care of you . " <p> Night closed around them , and Carmen drifted into sleep , slumped in the corner between her seat back and the door . She twisted and whined , then slipped off her seat belt and curled on the seat with Snaggly clutched to her chest . <p> At a rest stop , Shelby lifted her onto the rear seat . As she covered the little form with a spare shirt , she thought about their fight with Lois . Most seven-year-olds would have simply cringed and cried . Perhaps what she and Carmen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and running again had taught the child to attack rather than retreat . <p> Back on the freeway , she set the rental car 's cruise control on seventy and ticked off the miles . They had to get rid of the vehicle ; in a matter of hours the CBTF would know its make , model , and license number and would have every highway patrol officer in the country watching for it . Throughout the night , pausing only for a brief nap at a rest area , she barreled north on I- 95 , then west to intersect I-75 , heading for Atlanta . She could ditch the car there and take public transportation . Every mode departed from that city for places all across America . <p> With no identity documents other than those the CBTF had supplied , they could n't board a plane . A bus , she decided . Pay cash for tickets to a place farther west , maybe Los Angeles , but get off the bus in Phoenix . Even if the CBTF traced the tickets and guessed her strategy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
