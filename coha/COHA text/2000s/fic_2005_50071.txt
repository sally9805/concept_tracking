LOOKING BACK , IT 'S CLEAR I was the only one , thanks to years of research into obscure myths and folklore , who could have saved poor Rick Meech , my friend and neighbor . All the clues were there , but my mind was not receptive , a great irony , since it was clearly a perfect receiver for them . It 's as if an experienced dermatologist , talking to a friend , did n't notice a giant multicolored melanoma in the middle of his forehead . <p> He mentioned , quite emphatically , finding a strange object , apparently an egg , but without the typical ovoid shape ; rather , it was like a hexahedron , a solid with six flat faces . More significant , and I should have caught it immediately , he claimed to have found it not among the hens , where eggs belong , but in a separate little hut where he kept an aggressive rooster , Conquistador . <p> Anyhow , he took the puzzling object to the garden , where the light was better , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house that he had a phone call , he put it on a flat rock and left it there . When he returned twenty minutes later , the egg had vanished , but even more queer was a group of toads , numbering at least twelve , milling about the rock . Even one in this semi-arid region of manicured lawns is far from common , so he had to wonder . <p> That seemed to be the end of the matter , if not the mystery , until five weeks later , when a neighbor spotted him staggering out of the front gate , waving his arms wildly and shouting incoherent phrases . He fell dead within a few minutes . At the same time , what seemed to be a small , very glittery lizard with a mitre-like crest ran with weasel-like speed and agility into the street , where it scuttled through a sewer-grate and disappeared . <p> The police , spurred by Rick 's family and friends , explored the sewer , but found only a number of dead rats . I inferred , but said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big rodents must have thought here was easy prey and a nice snack , only to learn too late that the scaly beast 's breath and gaze are both deadly . Breathe near it , or stare into its yellow , feral eyes and you die . <p> What we have here , at large in this sedate community , can be nothing else than that terrifying legendary beast , a Basilisk , hatched by a toad ( or serpent ) from a cock 's egg . <p> Now , obviously , it must be destroyed . Just as Perseus defeated Medusa by tricking her into directing her gaze into his burnished shield so that like her victims she turned to stone , so I must also make use of the Basilisk 's reflection , the sight of which kills it . <p> I must acquire a good mirror , the vanity type with a handle , a flashlight , and , of course , a gas-mask . With these , extreme caution , and a bit of luck I can surely rid the world of this dreadful little monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear . I owe it to Rick . I am terrified of facing it down in that dark sewer , but have no choice , being the only one who knows what to do . May God help me . <p> Author Affiliation
