Why I Became a Late Merger // ( and Why You Should Too ) // Why does the other lane always seem to be moving faster ? // It is a question you have no doubt asked yourself while crawling down some choked highway , watching with mounting frustration as the adjacent cars glide ahead . You drum the wheel with your fingers . You change the radio station . You fixate on one car as a benchmark of your own lack of progress . You try to figure out what that weird button next to the rearwindow // defroster actually does . // I used to think this was just part of the natural randomness of the highway . Sometimes fate would steer me into the faster lane , sometimes it would relinquish me to the slow lane . // That was until recently , when I had an experience that made me rethink my traditionally passive outlook on the road , and upset the careful set of assumptions that had always guided my behavior in traffic . // I made a major lifestyle change . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point you have found yourself driving along the highway when a sign announces that the left lane , in which you are traveling , will close one mile ahead , and that you must merge right . // You notice an opening in the right lane and quickly move over . You breathe a sigh , happy to be safely ensconced in the Lane That Will Not End . Then , as the lane creeps to a slow halt , you notice with rising indignation that cars in the lane you have vacated are continuing to speed ahead , out of sight . You quietly seethe and contemplate returning to the much faster left lane  --  if only you could work an opening . You grimly accept your condition . // One day , not long ago , I had an epiphany on a New Jersey highway . I was having a typical white-knuckle drive among the scenic oil-storage depots and chemical-processing plants of northern Jersey when suddenly , on the approach to the Pulaski Skyway , the sign loomed : LANE ENDS ONE MILE . MERGE RIGHT . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickle at the back of my brain telling me to get in the already crowded right lane . Just do what the sign says , that voice usually counsels . Instead , I listened to another , more insistent voice : Do n't be a sucker . You can do better . I plowed purposefully ahead , oblivious to the hostile stares of other drivers . From the corner of my eye I could see my wife cringing . After passing dozens of cars , I made it to the bottleneck point , where , filled with newfound swagger , I took my rightful turn in the small alternating " zipper " merge that had formed . I merged , and it was clear asphalt ahead . My heart was beating faster . My wife covered her face with her hands . // In the days after , a creeping guilt and confusion took hold . Was I wrong to have done this ? Or had I been doing it wrong all my life ? Looking for an answer , I posted an anonymous inquiry on Ask MetaFilter , a Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the " hive mind " of an anonymous audience of overeducated and overopinionated geeks . Why should one lane move faster than the other , I wanted to know , and why are people rewarded for merging at the last possible moment ? And was my new lifestyle , that of the late merger , somehow deviant ? // I was startled by the torrent of responses , and how quickly they came . What struck me most was the passion and conviction with which people argued their various cases  --  and the fact that while many people seemed to think I was wrong , almost as many seemed to think I was right . Rather than easy consensus , I had stumbled into a gaping divide of irreconcilable // belief . // The first camp  --  let us name it after the bumper sticker that says practice random acts of kindness  --  viewed early mergers as virtuous souls doing the right thing and late mergers as arrogant louts . " Unfortunately , people suck , " wrote one Random Acts poster . " They 'll try whatever they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a few car lengths ahead of you . . . . People who feel that they have more pressing concerns and are generally more important than you will keep going , and some weak-spined schmuck will let them in further down , slowing your progress even more . This sucks ; I 'm afraid it 's the way of the world . " // Another camp , the minority camp-let 's call them Live Free or Die , after the license-plate motto of the state of New Hampshire-argued that the late mergers were quite rationally utilizing the highway 's maximum capacity , thus making life better for everyone . In their view , the other group 's attempts toward politeness and fairness were actually detrimental to all . // It got more complicated . Some argued that late merges caused more accidents . Some said the system worked much better in Germany , and hinted that my dilemma perhaps revealed some national failing in the American character . Some said they were afraid of not being " let in " at the last moment ; some said they would actively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often do . So what was going on here ? Are we not all driving the same road , did we not all pass the same driving tests ? What was puzzling was not just the variety of responses but the sense of moral righteousness each person attributed to his or her highway behavior , and the vitriol each person reserved for those holding the opposite view . For the most part , people were not citing traffic laws or actual evidence but their own personal sense of what was right . // I even found someone claiming to have had a conversion experience exactly the opposite of mine . " Until very recently , I was a ' late merger , ' " wrote the author , an executive with a software company , in a business magazine . Why had he become a born-again early merger ? " Because I came to realize that traffic flowed faster the sooner people merged . " He used this as a metaphor for successful team building in corporate America , in which " late mergers " were those who consistently put their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early mergers , " he wrote , could help push companies to their " maximum communal speed . " But did traffic flow faster when people merged sooner ? Or did it just seem more noble to think that it did ? // . . . // You may suspect that getting people to merge in a timely fashion , and without killing one another , is less of a traffic problem and more of a human problem . The road , more than simply a system of regulations and designs , is a place where many millions of us , with only loose parameters for how to behave , are thrown together daily in a kind of massive petri dish in which all kinds of uncharted , little-understood dynamics are at work . There is no other place where so many people from different walks of life  --  different ages , races , classes , religions , genders , political preferences , lifestyle choices , levels of psychological stability  --  mingle so freely . // What do we really know about how it all works ? Why do we act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might that say about us ? Are certain people predisposed to drive certain ways ? Do women behave differently than men ? And if , as conventional wisdom has it , drivers have become progressively less civil over the past several decades , why is that so ? Is the road a microcosm of society , or its own place with its own set of rules ? I have a friend , an otherwise timorous Latin teacher , who once told me how , in a modest Toyota Corolla , he had defiantly " stuck it " to the driver of an eighteen-wheeler who he felt was hogging the road . Some mysterious force had turned this gentle suburban scholar into the Travis Bickle of the turnpike . ( Are you tailgatin ' me ? ) Was it traffic , or had the beast always been lurking within ? // The more you think about it  --  or , rather , the more time you spend in traffic with time to think about it  --  the more these sorts of puzzling questions swim to the surface . Why can one sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why does a ten-minute " incident " create one hundred minutes of gridlock ? Do people really take longer to vacate a parking spot when someone else is waiting , or does it just seem so ? Do the car-pool lanes on highways help fight congestion or cause more of it ? Just how dangerous are large trucks ? How does what we drive , where we drive , and with whom we drive affect the way we drive ? Why do so many New Yorkers jaywalk , while hardly anyone in Copenhagen does ? Is New Delhi 's traffic as chaotic as it seems , or does a beautiful order lurk beneath the frenzied surface ? // Like me , you may have wondered : What could traffic tell us , if someone would just stop to listen ? // The first thing you hear is the word itself . Traffic . What did you think of when you read that word ? In all likelihood you pictured a crowded highway , filled with people obstructing your progress . It was not a pleasant thought . This is interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had rather positive connotations . It originally referred ( and still does ) to trade and the movement of goods . That meaning slowly expanded to include the people engaging in that trade and the dealings among people themselves  --  Shakespeare 's prologue to Romeo and Juliet describes the " traffic of our stage . " It then came to signify the movement itself , as in the " traffic on this road . " At some point , people and things became interchangeable . The movement of goods and people were intertwined in a single enterprise ; after all , if one was going somewhere , it was most likely in pursuit of commerce . This is still true today , as most traffic problems occur during the times we are all going to work , but we seem less likely to think of traffic in terms of motion and mobility , as a great river of opportunity , than as something that makes our lives miserable . // Now , like then , we think of traffic as an abstraction , a grouping of things rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic " or " getting stuck in traffic , " but we never talk  --  in polite company , at least  --  about " beating people " or " getting stuck in people . " The news lumps together " traffic and weather " as if they were both passive forces largely outside our control , even though whenever we complain about it , we do so because we 're part of the traffic . ( To be fair , I suppose we are now part of the weather as well , thanks to the atmospheric emissions of that same driving . ) We say there is " too much traffic " without exactly knowing what we mean . Are we saying there are too many people ? Or that there are not enough roads for the people who are there ? Or that there is too much affluence , which has enabled too many people to own cars ? // One routinely hears of " traffic problems . " But what is a traffic problem ? To a traffic engineer , a " traffic problem " might mean that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that street , the " traffic problem " could be too many cars , or cars going too fast . For the store owner on that same street , a " traffic problem " might mean there is not enough traffic . Blaise Pascal , the renowned seventeenth-century French scientist and philosopher , had perhaps the only foolproof remedy for traffic : Stay home . " I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact , " he wrote . " That they can not stay quietly in their own chamber . " Pascal , as it happens , is credited with inventing history 's first urban bus service . He died a mere five months later . Was Parisian traffic his undoing ? // Whatever " traffic problem " means to you , it may give you some comfort to know that traffic problems of all variety are as old as traffic itself . Ever since humans began to propel themselves artificially , society has struggled to catch up with the implications of mobility , to sort out technical and social responses to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , will see rutted streets marked by the tracks of chariot wheels . But many are wide enough for only one set of wheels . The tourist wonders : Was it a one-way street ? Did a lowly commoner have to reverse himself out of the way when a member of the imperial legions came trotting along in the other direction ? If two chariots arrived at an intersection simultaneously , who went first ? These questions were neglected for years , but recent work by the American traffic archaeologist Eric Poehler has provided some answers . // By studying the wear patterns on curbstones at corners , as well as the stepping stones set up for pedestrians to cross the " rutways , " Poehler was able to discern not just the direction of traffic but the direction of turns onto two-way streets at intersections . It seems , based on the " directionally diagnostic wear patterns " on the curbstones , that Pompeii drivers drove on the right side of the street ( part of a larger cultural preference for righthanded activities ) , used primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving on certain streets altogether . There seemed to be no traffic signs or street signs . It may please the reader to know , however , that Pompeii did suffer from its share of road construction and detours ( as when the building of baths forced the reversal of the Vico di Mercurio ) . // In ancient Rome , the chariot traffic grew so intense that Caesar , the self-proclaimed curator viarum , or " director of the great roads , " declared a daytime ban on carts and chariots , " except to transport construction materials for the temples of the gods or for other great public works or to take away demolition materials . " Carts could enter the city only after three p.m . And yet , as one so often finds in the world of traffic , there is very rarely an action without an equal and opposite reaction . By making it easier for the average Roman to move around during the day , Caesar made it harder for them to sleep at night . The poet Juvenal , sounding like a second-century version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Only if one has a lot of money can one sleep in Rome . The source of the problem lies in the carts passing through the bottlenecks of the curved streets , and the flocks that stop and make so much noise they would prevent . . . even a devil-fish from sleeping . " // By the time we get to medieval England , we can see that traffic was still a problem in search of a solution . Towns tried to limit , through laws or tolls , where and when traveling merchants could sell things . Magistrates restricted the entry of " shod carts " into towns because they damaged bridges and roads . In one town , horses were forbidden to drink at the river , as children were often found playing nearby . Speeding became a social problem . The Liber Albus , the rule book of fifteenth-century London , forbade a driver to " drive his cart more quickly when it is unloaded than when it is loaded " ( if he did , he would be looking at a forty-pence speeding ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prison at the will of the Mayor " ) . // In 1720 , traffic fatalities from " furiously driven " carts and coaches were named the leading cause of death in London ( eclipsing fire and " immoderate quaffing " ) , while commentators decried the " Controversies , Quarreling , and Disturbances " caused by drivers " contesting for the way . " Meanwhile , in the New York of 1867 , horses were killing an average of four pedestrians a week ( a bit higher than today 's rate of traffic fatalities , although there were far fewer people and far fewer vehicles ) . Spooked runaways trampled pedestrians underfoot , " reckless drivers " paid little heed to the 5-mile-an-hour speed limit , and there was little concept of right-of-way . " As matters now stand , " the New York Times wrote in 1888 , " drivers seem to be legally justified in ignoring crossings and causing pedestrians to run or dodge over vehicles when they wish to pass over . " // The larger the cities grew , and the more ways people devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became , and the more difficult to manage . Take , for instance , the scene that occurred on lower Broadway in New York City on the afternoon of December 23 , 1879 , an " extraordinary and unprecedented blockade of traffic " that lasted five hours . Who was in this " nondescript jam , " as the New York Times called it ? The list is staggering : " single and double teams , double teams with a tandem leader , and four-horse teams ; hacks , coupes , trucks , drays , butcher carts , passenger stages , express wagons , grocers ' and hucksters ' wagons , two-wheeled ' dog carts , ' furniture carts and piano trucks , and jewelers ' and fancy goods dealers ' light delivery wagons , and two or three advertising vans , with flimsy transparent canvas sides to show illumination at night . " // Just when it seemed as if things could not get more complicated on the road , along came a novel and controversial machine , the first new form of personal transportation since the days of Caesar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of traffic . I am talking , of course , about the bicycle . After a couple of false starts , the " bicycle boom " of the late nineteenth century created a social furor . Bicycles were too fast . They threatened their riders with strange ailments , like kyphosis bicyclistarum , or " bicycle stoop . " They spooked horses and caused accidents . Fisticuffs were exchanged between cyclists and noncyclists . Cities tried to ban them outright . They were restricted from streets because they were not coaches , and restricted from sidewalks because they were not pedestrians . The bicycle activists of today who argue that cars should not be allowed in places like Brooklyn 's Prospect Park were preceded , over a hundred years ago , by " wheelmen " fighting for the right for bicycles to be allowed in that same park . New bicycle etiquette questions were broached : Should men yield the right-of-way to women ? // There is a pattern here , from the chariot in Pompeii to the Segway in Seattle . Once humans decided to do anything but walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn a whole new way of getting around and getting along . What is the road for ? Who is the road for ? How will these streams of traffic flow together ? Before the dust kicked up by the bicycles had even settled , the whole order was toppled again by the automobile , which was beginning to careen down those same " good roads " the cyclists themselves , in a bit of tragic irony , had helped create . // When driving began , it was like a juggernaut , and we have rarely had time to pause and reflect upon the new kind of life that was being made . When the first electric car debuted in mid-nineteenth-century England , the speed limit was hastily set at 4 miles per hour  --  the speed at which a man carrying a red flag could run ahead of a car entering a town , an event that was still a quite rare occurrence . That man with the red flag racing the car was like a metaphor of traffic itself . It was probably also the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The car was soon to create a world of its own , a world in which humans , separated from everything outside the car but still somehow connected , would move at speeds beyond anything for which their evolutionary history had prepared them . // At first , cars simply joined the chaotic traffic already in the street , where the only real rule of the road in most North American cities was " keep to the right . " In 1902 , William Phelps Eno , a " well-known yachtsman , clubman , and Yale graduate " who would become known as " the first traffic technician of the whole world , " set about untangling the strangling miasma that was New York City 's streets . ( Deaths by automobile were already , according to the New York Times , " every-day occurrences " with little " news value " unless they involved persons of " exceptional social or business prominence . " ) Eno was every bit the WASP patrician as social reformer , a familiar character then in New York . He thundered at " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wielded his favorite maxim : " It is easy to control a trained army but next to impossible to regulate a mob . " Eno proposed a series of " radical ordinances " to rein in New York 's traffic , a plan that seems hopelessly quaint now , with its instructions on the " right way to turn a corner " and its audacious demands that cars go in only one direction around Columbus Circle . But Eno , who became a global celebrity of sorts , boating off to Paris and S ? o Paulo to solve local traffic problems , was as much a social engineer as a traffic engineer , teaching vast numbers of people to act and communicate in new ways , often against their will . // In the beginning this language was more Tower of Babel than Esperanto . In one town , the blast of a policeman 's whistle might mean stop , in another go . A red light indicated one thing here , another thing there . // The first stop signs were yellow , even though many people thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early-twentieth-century traffic control , " there was a great wave of arrow lenses , purple lenses , lenses with crosses , etc. , all giving special instructions to the motorist , who , as a rule , had n't the faintest idea of what these special indications meant . " The systems we take for granted today required years of evolution , and were often steeped in controversy . The first traffic lights had two indications , one for stop and one for go . Then someone proposed a third light , today 's " amber phase , " so cars would have time to clear the intersection . Some engineers resisted this , on the grounds that vehicles were " amber rushing , " or trying to beat the light , which actually made things more dangerous . Others wanted the yellow light shown before the signal was changing to red and before it was changing from red back to green ( which one sees today in Denmark , among other places , but nowhere in North America ) . There were strange regional one-offs that never caught on ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Western in Los Angeles had a small clock whose hand revealed to the approaching driver // how much " green " or " red " time remained . // Were red and green even the right colors ? In 1923 it was pointed out that approximately one in ten people saw only gray when looking at a traffic signal , because of color blindness . Might not blue and yellow , which almost everyone could see , be better ? Or would that create catastrophic confusion among all those who had already learned red and green ? Despite all the uncertainty , traffic engineering soon hoisted itself onto a wobbly pedestal of authority , even if , as the transportation historian Jeffrey Brown argues , engineers ' neutral-sounding Progressive scientific ideology , which compared " curing " congestion to fighting typhoid , reflected the desires of a narrow band of urban elites ( i.e. , car owners ) . Thus it was quickly established that the prime objective of a street was simply to move as many cars as quickly as possible  --  an idea that obscured , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city streets . // After more than a century of tinkering with traffic , plus years of tradition and scientific research , one would think all these issues would have been smoothed out . And they have been , largely . We drive in a landscape that looks virtually the same wherever we go : A red light in Morocco means the same thing as it does in Montana . A walk " man " that moves us across a street in Berlin does the same in Boston , even if the " man " looks a bit different . ( The beloved jaunty , hat-clad Ampelm ? nnchen of the former German Democratic Republic has survived the collapse of the Berlin Wall . ) We drive on highways that have been so perfectly engineered we forget we are moving at high speeds  --  indeed , we are sometimes barely aware of moving at all . // For all this standardized sameness , though , there is much that is still simply not known about how to manage the flows of all those people in traffic  --  drivers , walkers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient manner . For example , you may have seen , in some cities , a " countdown signal " that indicates , in seconds , exactly how much time you have before the " Walk " signal will change to " Do n't Walk . " Some people in the traffic world think this innovation has made things better for pedestrians , but it is just as easy to find others who think it offers no improvement at all . Some people think that marked bicycle lanes on streets are the ideal for cyclists , while others prefer separated lanes ; still others suggest that maybe having no bicycle lanes at all would be best for bike riders . For a time it was thought that highway traffic would flow better and more safely if trucks were forced to obey a slower speed limit than cars . But " differential speed limits " just seemed to swap out one kind of crash risk for another , with no overall safety benefit , so the " DSLs " were gradually rolled back . // Henry Barnes , the legendary traffic commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long career in his charmingly titled memoir The Man with the Red and Green Eyes , observed that " traffic was as much an emotional problem as it was a physical and mechanical one . " People , he concluded , were tougher to crack than cars . " As time goes on the technical problems become more automatic , while the people problems become more surrealistic. " // That " surrealistic " side of traffic will be the focus of this book . I began my research with the intention of stopping to take a look around at an environment that has become so familiar we no longer see it ; I wanted to slow down for a moment and think about what 's going on out there as we drive , walk , cycle , or find some other way to get around . ( Look out for the SKATEBOARD ROUTE signs the next time you 're in Portland , Oregon . ) My aim was to learn to read between the dotted lines on the highway , sift through the strange patterns that traffic contains , interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between vehicles . I would study not only the traffic signals we obey but also the traffic signals we send . // Many of us , myself included , seem to take driving a car fairly lightly , perhaps holding on to some simple myths of independence and power , but it is actually an incredibly complex and demanding task : We are navigating through a legal system , we are becoming social actors in a spontaneous setting , we are processing a bewildering amount of information , we are constantly making predictions and calculations and on-the-fly judgments of risk and reward , and we 're engaging in a huge amount of sensory and cognitive activity  --  the full scope of which scientists are just beginning to understand . // Much of our mobile life is still shrouded in mystery and murk . We welcome into our vehicles new technologies like cell phones , in-car navigation systems , and " radio display system " radios ( which show song titles ) before we have had time to understand the complicated effects those devices might have on our driving . Opinion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do things . Should hands be at ten a.m. and two p.m. on the steering wheel , as we were once taught  --  or have air bags made that a dangerous proposition ? When changing lanes , is it sufficient to simply signal and check the mirrors ? Or should you turn your head and glance over your shoulder ? Relying on mirrors alone leaves one open to blind spots , which engineers say can exist on any car ( indeed , they almost seemed designed to occur at the most inconvenient and dangerous place , the area just behind and to the left of the driver ) . But turning your head means not looking forward , perhaps for that vital second . " Head checks are one of the most dangerous things you can do , " says the research director of a highway safety agency . // So what do we do ? If these issues are n't complicated enough , consider the right side-view mirror itself . In the United States , the driver will notice that their passenger side-view mirror is convex ; it usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer than they appear . " The driver 's side mirror is not . In Europe , both mirrors are convex . " What you have today is this clearly pretty wrong situation , " says Michael Flannagan , a researcher at the University of Michigan who specializes in driver vision . " It 's wrong in the sense that Europe does one thing , the U.S. does another . They ca n't both be optimal . These are both entrenched traditions , neither of which is fully based on rational , explicit argument . " The mirror , as with so many things in traffic , is more complicated than it might appear . // And so we drive around with vague ideas of how things work . Every last one of us is a " traffic expert , " but our vision is skewed . We see things only through our own windshields . It is a repeated truism , borne out by insurance company surveys , for example , that most accidents happen very close to home . On first glance , it makes statistical sense : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the car , in your immediate surroundings . But could there be something deeper at work ? Habits , psychologists suggest , provide a way to reduce the amount of mental energy that must be expended on routine tasks . Habits also form a mind-set , which gives us cues on how to behave in certain settings . So when we enter a familiar setting , like the streets around our house , habitual behavior takes over . On the one hand , this is efficient : It frees us from having to gather all sorts of new information , from getting sidetracked . Yet on the other hand , because we are expending less energy on analyzing what is around us , we may be letting our mental guard down . If in three years there has never been a car coming out of the Joneses ' driveway in the morning , what happens on the first day of the fourth year , when suddenly there is ? Will we see it in time ? Will we see it at all ? Our feeling of safety and control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israeli researchers found that drivers committed more traffic violations on familiar routes than on unfamiliar routes . // Surely you have had a moment when you were driving down the road and suddenly found yourself " awake at the wheel , " unable to remember the last few minutes . In a way , much of the time we spend in traffic is like that , a kind of gauzy dream state of automatic muscle movements and half-remembered images . Traffic is an in-between time in which we are more likely to think about where we are going than where we are at the moment . Time and space are skewed in traffic ; our vision is fragmented and often unclear , and we take in and then almost immediately forget hundreds , perhaps thousands of images and impressions . Every minute we are surrounded by a different group of people , people we will share space with but never talk to , never meet . // Considering that many of us may spend more time in traffic than we do eating meals with our family , going on vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit deeper into the experience . As an American in the early twenty-first century , I live in the most auto-dependent , caradapted , mileage-happy society in the history of the planet . We spend more on driving than on food or health care . As of the last census , there were more cars than citizens . In 1960 , hardly any household had three vehicles , and most had only one . Now more own three than own one . Even as the size of the average North American family has fallen over the past several decades , the number of homes with multicar garages has almost doubled  --  one in five new homes has a three-car garage . // To pay for all that extra space , commute times have also been expanding . One of the fastest-growing categories in the last " commuting census " in the United States was that of " extreme commuters , " people who spend upward of two hours a day in traffic ( moving or otherwise ) . Many of these are people pushed farther out by higher home prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'd be home by now , " in a phenomenon real estate agents call " drive till you qualify "  --  in other words , trading miles for mortgage . The average American , as of 2005 , spent thirty-eight hours annually stuck in traffic . In 1969 , nearly half of American children walked or biked to school ; now just 16 percent do . From 1977 to 1995 , the number of trips people made on foot dropped by nearly half . This has given rise to a joke : In America , a pedestrian is someone who has just parked their car . // Traffic has become a way of life . The expanding car cup holder , which became fully realized standard equipment only in the 1980s , is now the vital enabler of dashboard dining , a " food and beverage venue " hosting such products as Campbell 's Soup at Hand and Yoplait 's Go-Gurt . In 2001 , there were 134 food products that featured the word go on the label or in ads ; by 2004 , there were 504 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-the-go eating occasions " in the United States and Europe combined is predicted to rise from 73.2 billion in 2003 to 84.4 billion in 2008 . Fast-food restaurants now clock as much as 70 percent of their sales at drive-through windows . ( Early in our romance with the car , we used to go to " drive-in " restaurants , but those now seem relics of a gentler , slower age . ) An estimated 22 percent of all restaurant meals are ordered through a car window in America , but other places , like Northern Ireland  --  where one in eight people are said to eat in the car at least once per week  --  are getting into the act too . McDonald 's has added a second lane to hundreds of its restaurants in the United States in order to speed traffic , and at its new drive-throughs in China , dubbed De Lai Su ( for " Come and Get It Fast " ) , the company is pitching retooled regional offerings like " rice burgers " to its burgeoning drive-through customers . Starbucks , which initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive-throughs at more than half of its new company-owned stores . The " third place " that Starbucks espouses , the place for community and leisure between home and work , is , arguably , the car . // Traffic has even shaped the food we eat . " One-handed convenience " is the mantra , with forkless foods like Taco Bell 's hexagonal Crunchwrap Supreme , designed " to handle well in the car . " I spent an afternoon in Los Angeles with an advertising executive who had , at the behest of that same restaurant chain , conducted a test , in actual traffic , of which foods were easiest to eat while driving . The main barometer of success or failure was the number of napkins used . But if food does spill , one can simply reach for Tide to Go , a penlike device for " portable stain removal , " which can be purchased at one of the more than twelve hundred ( and growing ) CVS drugstores that feature a drive-through window . The " audiobook , " virtually unheard of before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would n't you know it , " traffic congestion " gets prominent mention in sales reports from the Audio Publishers Association . Car commuting is so entrenched in daily life that National Public Radio refers to its most popular segments as " driveway moments , " meaning the listener is so riveted to a story they can not leave their car . In Los Angeles , some synagogues have been forced to change the time of their evening services from eight p.m. to six p.m. in order to capture commuters on their way home , as going home and then returning to services is too much to bear in L.A. traffic . So much time is spent in cars in the United States , studies show , that drivers ( particularly men ) have higher rates of skin cancer on their left sides  --  look for the opposite effect in countries where people drive on the left . // Americans have long been fabled for their love of mobility . The nineteenth-century French visitor Alexis de Tocqueville wrote of millions " marching at once toward the same horizon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm flying over any large city and look at the parallel strings of red and white lights , draped like glittering necklaces over the landscape . // But this is not just a book about North America . While the United States may still have the world 's most thoroughgoing car culture , traffic has become a universal condition , inflected with regional accents . In Moscow , the old images of Russians waiting in line have been replaced by images of idling cars stuck in heavy congestion . Ireland has seen its car-ownership rates double since 1990 . The once tranquil Tibetan capital of Lhasa now has jams and underground parking garages . In Caracas , Venezuela , traffic is currently ranked " among the world 's worst , " thanks in part to an oil-fueled economic boom  --  and in part to cheap gas ( as low as seven cents a gallon ) . In S ? o Paulo , the wealthy shuttle between the city 's more than three hundred helipads rather than brave the legendary traffic . In Jakarta , desperate Indonesians work as " car jockeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help drivers meet the passenger quota for the faster car-pool lanes . // Another traffic-related job has emerged outside Shanghai and other Chinese cities , according to Jian Shou Wang , the head of Kijiji ( the eBay of China ) . There , one can find a new type of worker : Zhiye dailu , or professional road guides , who for a small fee will jump into one 's car and provide directions in the unfamiliar city  --  a human " nav system . " But with opportunity comes cost . In China , the number of people being killed on the road every year is now greater than the total number of vehicles the country was manufacturing annually as recently as 1970 . By 2020 , the World Health Organization predicts , road fatalities will be the world 's third-leading cause of death . // We are all traveling the same road , if each in our own peculiar way . I invite you to join me on that road as I try , over the din of passing cars , to hear what traffic has to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
