<p> The worst season of Clinton Portis 's career is over , seven games earlier than expected and with the Washington Redskins ' premier running back facing more surgery and a long offseason of rehabilitation . <p> Portis , who was placed on the injured reserve list yesterday after having surgery to repair a broken bone in his right hand Monday , will undergo additional surgery soon to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder , which was partially dislocated on the opening drive of the preseason . <p> Portis , 25 , managed to avoid serious injury in his first four NFL seasons , despite being used as a workhorse for 21/2 seasons by the Redskins . But the wear and tear that running backs endure and his all-out style of play caught up to him . <p> Generously listed at 5 feet 11 , 212 pounds but probably closer to 5-9 , Portis said he was never fully healthy this season , hobbled by ankle and hand problems even after his shoulder , twice injured , began to heal . <p> Portis said he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reevaluated at season 's end . But once he was sidelined with the hand injury , Portis and the team elected to have shoulder surgery in the next few weeks , after the hand has sufficiently healed , according to Bubba Tyer , the Redskins ' director of sports medicine . <p> " You know in football you 're going to have nicks and bruises , and it 's only a matter of time " until a serious injury arises , Portis said . " If you play long enough , it 's going to happen . If I ran out of bounds every play I 'm sure I 'd be a lot happier , but at the same time I 'd be getting bashed for running out of bounds . You ca n't win in this situation . It 's going to happen , and my time is going to come to an end one day , eventually . And before it does I want to get the most out of this game , and if my carries pile up , I 'm going to have the opportunity to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tyer said that torn cartilage in Portis 's shoulder must be repaired , and that doctors also are likely to tighten Portis 's shoulder during the arthroscopic procedure . The labrum repair alone requires a four-to-five month rehabilitation , Tyer said , " so we want to get it done as soon as we can . " The cast on Portis 's hand must come off first , but Tyer was hopeful the surgery could be performed within the next three weeks . <p> Portis , whose right labrum was repaired in high school , surprised many observers by dressing for the season-opening game against Minnesota on Sept. 11 despite missing virtually the entire preseason , and he ran 10 times in that defeat . He was hit on the shoulder during the game and suffered another injury , and did not play the following week at Dallas . At that point , the team was 0-2 and , although Portis led the team to successive victories the next two weeks , he was never the same . <p> Portis broke his hand in the first quarter of Sunday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be out at least four to six weeks because of that injury . <p> Portis said he did not regret playing in Week 1 despite his lengthy layoff . " My shoulder was fine , " he said . " If I had it over to do again , the only thing I would do is miss the whole preseason . " <p> Coach Joe Gibbs and the athletic training staff devised a careful plan after Portis 's initial injury , and stuck to it , with all in agreement . " We had rested him for quite a while , and I think he felt like he was ready to go and wanted to play " in Week 1 , Gibbs said . " He missed a lot of work , which was tough for him , and I think that 's hard . In preseason he missed almost three weeks of work and now you 're going to go play . So I think it was hard for him to get back , and it seemed like every time he got to feeling better something else would happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in last year . So hopefully , now we 'll get him healthy and ready for next year . " <p> Portis , who ran for more than 1,500 yards in three of his first four seasons , finishes this season with 127 rushes for 523 yards  --  a 4.1 average  --  and seven touchdowns . He never found his niche in the new offensive system of associate head coach Al Saunders . The roles of running backs Ladell Betts and Mike Sellers grew as Portis was repeatedly forced out because of injuries and fatigue . Portis did not produce the explosive , long runs he is known for , and rushed at least 25 times in a game only once . <p> Running backs coach Earnest Byner said Portis never regained his stamina or his " game legs " because of the preseason injury , routine absences from practices and being forced out of games . Portis said he tried to protect his left shoulder , which led to many awkward collisions . <p> " I tried to keep it from getting hit , and never could really jam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portis said . " I knew my limits . " <p> The Redskins traded Pro Bowl cornerback Champ Bailey and a second-round pick to Denver to acquire Portis in 2004 , one of Gibbs 's first moves as coach . Portis had never carried more than 290 times in a season in Denver but rushed 343 times in 2004 , saying after the season that he felt the Redskins ' blocking scheme was not tailored to his strengths , forcing him to plow inside like Baltimore 's Jamal Lewis , who weighs 245 pounds . <p> The Redskins used more zone blocking and stretch plays in 2005 , and Portis , with 352 carries , led the team to a five-game winning streak to end the regular season , securing the club 's first playoff berth since 1999 . In 2004 and 2005 , only two other NFL backs , bulkier Shaun Alexander and Rudi Johnson , rushed more times than Portis . <p> " As a running back you 're bound to lose an extended amount of time at some point unless you 're extremely , extremely lucky , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first few years he had some nicks and had to miss a couple of games , but he has n't had anything really serious . Now what this does is it points to the offseason and how crucial the offseason conditioning and training and the rehab is , how crucial that will be for his ultimate success to continue on . " <p> Portis skipped Washington 's offseason program in 2004 , but participated in it last year . He has spoken openly over the years about his desire to enjoy himself during his down time and has never faced this daunting an offseason as a pro before . Last week , wide receiver Santana Moss , a close friend , noted that while Portis is always prepared to play on Sundays , he is not a workout warrior . " If he worried about football , he 'd work out when he has to , " Moss said . " That 's letting you know this guy knows he can go out and play football when he has to . It 's not something he feels like he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teammates and coaches have spoken of his maturation the past two years as he became a team leader and embraced the responsibilities of his expanded role . That will be important next year for the team and for Portis , as he tries to prove that 2006 was not an indication of things to come . <p> " What you hope is that it is isolated , " Byner said . " But also you need to do the things that are necessary  --  and I think he will  --  to ward off future injuries . And that is get in the weight room , do additional training and get the massages and get rest and relaxation . And I think he will take hold to that . "
