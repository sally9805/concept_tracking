ONE DAY IN THAT LONG , SOMETIMES COLD , sometimes warm spring of 1924 , feeling desperate , Moses Rosen the pawnbroker and amateur violinist , age thirty-five , went to the cemetery to talk to his uncle . Lasting love eluded him , it seemed , but desire did n't let up . He loved and loved , and kept loving long after he was unloved . Why was that so , he wanted to know . <p> It was , as it happened , a cold day in late March . The weather in Oklahoma was a joke , a common joke , and not funny at all , in Moses ' humble opinion . He did not like wearing an overcoat and gloves in late March , in fact had put them away weeks before , and they smelled already of mothballs . <p> At Uncle Ezra 's grave , the chilly wind whining across the flat , treeless land , Moses knelt , placed his cheek against the cold stone monument . Dear Ezra , who years ago had opened his home and heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again have mercy , intercede if intercession were in the scheme of things ? Tell him , please , was n't there some formula for escape from desire , a chant he might recite , an ancient prayer , a holy song that would deliver him from this outrageous lust for love , or was he to be tormented all his life with passing visions of unattainable beauty , never satisfaction ? Answer , please , Uncle Ezra , from the wisdom of your perspective on high . <p> Nothing . Clouds raced overhead . It made him dizzy to look at them . Wherever Uncle Ezra was , he was n't up there . The wind stung Moses ' cheeks and gusted up suddenly , so strong it almost knocked him over . But then , rising , he caught a glimpse of a dark figure across the way , a woman , standing beside a monument taller than she was , a memorial shaped like a thick , oversized pencil-he could not remember the term ; there had to be a term for it , this gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Odalisk ? Obelisk ? One was a concubine , was n't it ? He could never remember which-one a slave to male desire , the other a phallic slab of stone , usually granite . What a difference a consonant makes . <p> The woman looked familiar-so many of them did , anymore , causing him frequently to turn away , hoping to avoid recognition . Still , this one drew him , the difference , no doubt , the surroundings , the eerie sense she conveyed of a ghost risen from one of these graves . Who , he wondered , among his past lovers might lie here ; whose grave had he inadvertently tramped upon ? It was his strict rule to ignore the obituaries and the editorials in the Daily Oklahoman , to read in fact only such advertisements and want ads in the Sunday edition as would keep him informed of the fair values of goods , and since he no longer attended church services and had devised a somewhat circuitous route from his house on Northwest Ninth Street to his shop on Broadway so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of deaths came to him by chance , if at all , as when some weeks ago a customer , a silverhaired lady pledging an heirloom ( so she said ) onyx brooch , referred in passing to the recent tragedy , the loss of our leader , and Moses realized that Warren G. Harding , the old reprobate , had died , and Coolidge , a simpleton , had taken office . <p> But perhaps this woman hovering at the granite phallus ( she seemed to be stroking it ) , perhaps she only mourned some recently departed lover , and it was her grief that made her familiar , her air ghostly . Moses approached cautiously , taking care to step only in the narrow pathway alongside the feet of the dead in their graves . Her back was to him . He thought he would stroll past , give her the chance to recognize him , claim him . It was a cold day and no weather for strolling , but strollers in a graveyard surely did not attend to the infelicities of weather , their purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw figures in motion here and there , walking with heads down , obviously deep in thought . He need n't feel out of place . <p> She turned to face him before he had reached her marker , but , because the glaring sun shone in his eyes , she recognized him and called to him before he knew who she was . <p> Mosey , she called him Mosey . Someone had called him that long ago , to his displeasure , and he cringed to hear it now . He considered turning away . Then he remembered . Yes , Lord have mercy , it was none other than Abigail Briggs , the clarinetist with whom he 'd played Bach and Beethoven and whom he 'd come to love , along with her mother Caroline , the ex-cellist , and , still later , her sister Annabelle , a coloratura soprano and organist . Abigail 's cheeks were flushed-no doubt from the biting wind-and her mouth , that lovely , muscular mouth with its firm ; thick lips , pursed as if for the entry of a clarinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you were in Philadelphia . <p> She took his hand-both he and she were wearing gloves-and they exchanged squeezes . <p> Baltimore , she said . It 's Baltimore , not Philadelphia . Oh , Mosey . It is you , is n't it . <p> He assured her it was so . But this was so unexpected . Had she moved back to Oklahoma City ? He had not expected her to write to him , but she might have let him know she was coming back . He was glad to see her , he really was . She lowered her gaze , glanced to one side ; and he knew in an instant . Her mother had died . Caroline Briggs lay dead in one of these graves . Surely not the one beneath the pointed slab , though . Abigail would not raise such a marker for her sweet , gentle , unobtrusive mother . Could the marker be for the lover who had supplanted him , then , the supposed uncle , what was his name , Albert , Albert Easley ? Moses had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavy white hair whose great head nodded and whose red-rimmed blue eyes snapped shut during the playing of the duets . Elixir of the gods , Uncle Albert had said of the music that put him to sleep so rapidly . Of course it had n't been Bach who lured Uncle Albert , but Abigail . Abigail was this faux uncle 's sweet elixir . <p> Dear God , Moses said , hoping this would cover any contingency , and reached for Abigail 's hand . But at the same instant , he felt a hand upon his shoulder and turned to see the mother , his Caroline of the clay pipe and knitting needles . Why , far from dead , she had scarcely aged ! He took her in his arms-Abigail , too ; he hugged mother and daughter both . How good to see them , how . . . unexpected , and yet somehow fated , as if sent to him as the answer , couched in decidedly ambiguous terms , to the question he 'd put to Uncle Ezra . ( Escape desire by returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many sites , far too many , surely . ) <p> You are n't changed , Caroline said . <p> Oh , but I am . <p> Of course he is , Abigail said . We all are , Mother . <p> And Annabelle ? he asked . <p> Abigail looked him hard in the eye , then turned to one side . <p> Greatly changed , Caroline said , nodding her head . <p> The Great Change , Abigail said sharply . <p> Ah , he said , understanding then that it was Annabelle whose grave lay marked by the granite phallus , Annabelle the younger daughter , the soprano and choir director from Topeka , Kansas , whose love , though passionate and in its way as compelling as what he 'd felt for her mother and older sister , had marked the end of his intriguing relations with the mother , just as relations with the mother had previously signified an end , though gradual , to his bond with the older daughter . He stepped around to the front of the phallus , careful to avoid any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters : <p> OUR FATHER <p> Stanley Ephraim Briggs <p> May He Rest in Peace <p> b. 1834 - d. 1902 <p> Beloved Mother <p> Caroline Eleanor Traynor Briggs <p> b. 1870 <p> Cherished Daughters <p> Abigail Faith <p> b. 1890 <p> Annabelle Constance <p> b. 1892 - d. 1918 <p> No doubt the terrible Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 had taken Annabelle Constance Briggs in the prime of life . Gazing at the monument , he remembered with full force his own bout with the influenza . It had struck him , he remembered , on the very verge of battle-or so they all had thought , all those raw recruits having recently completed training , waiting in Boston Harbor for the command that would send them down into the muddy trenches of France . He had enlisted in spite of his uncle 's fierce opposition and his own pacifist instincts , believing that his life , should he chance to lose it and should it prove worth anything , might give him the currency to redeem his soul . <p> Your mother , Uncle Ezra told Moses , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses honey , I know she would . Moses did not doubt his uncle , for he remembered his mother 's scorn for Teddy Roosevelt and the militaristic bluster of the Spanish-American War-a scorn shared by his father . But his father later came to worship Woodrow Wilson as a man of intelligence and culturea university president , after all-who would not send American boys to Europe except for the most honorable , complex , and incomprehensible reasons . And when Moses wrote announcing his decision to enlist , his father replied with approval and glowing praise . <p> He had not shown his father 's letter to Uncle Ezra nor spoken of its content , for his father 's enthusiasm embarrassed him and made him doubt his own resolution . Was he not yielding to the most sentimental of motives , to a rabid jingoism , a patriotic fervor as silly , if it were not so deadly earnest , as any in history ? The enemy , after all-these Germans called Boches , Huns-shared with him a common ancestry ; his very grandparents had been born in Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , was n't it , to place it in front of some inexorable force-a bayonet , say-that would pierce it and drain it of its proud blood and guts . He might throw himself beneath the speeding and sharpedged wheels of a train and thereby accomplish the same object , of course . Yet when he thought of such an option , his blood ran cold . He could muster no joy in the thought of such an end-there was the rub . His redemption , however contrived , must accomplish a larger end , a common good . His nation needed him . <p> Also this coming redemption must , he perceived to his horror , involve some significant risk , some genuine danger , if it were to challenge his luxuriant , sluggish sensibility . <p> And so the idea of fighting a war attracted him and in its way nourished him . But when he was actually issued boots and helmet , rifle and bayonet , he imagined his mother watching from on high , and his resolve gave way to a burning shame that only intensified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to march on stubbled fields , run over ravines , jump gullies , tread mud , wade across creeks , swim a river , shoot straw targets , and stab hay-stuffed Huns . Falling so suddenly ill , along with many others in his battalion , virtually in the moment of boarding the crowded , rat-infested ship that would take them to do battle with the enemy , seemed powerful evidence that Uncle Ezra and his mother were right . Quite possibly the influenza , with its violent coughing and feverish nightmares , amounted to divine retribution . This feeling , coupled with his own desire to buy back his soul with his life-not to mention the sly way the virus gained control of his blood and recklessly bargained for his heart-hampered his speedy recovery . <p> And while he lay in half-sleep on his cot aboard ship ( the USS Commerce ) , swaying and moaning , racked by a constant dry cough , hallucinating-a terrible Boche who bore a remarkable resemblance to J. S. Bach ( he remembered this clearly and had entered the vision in his journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) - this Bach-like Boche was wheeling a cannon around and pointing it at him , and at the very moment that a column of flame issued from Bach 's huge cannon , Annabelle Constance Briggs lay dying in the plains of Oklahoma-and of the very same malady that he , Moses , suffered , the Spanish flu ! Had she called out to him in her delirium ? Imagined him meaning her harm , as he had dreamt of poor Bach ? He would not flatter himself by thinking it . He hoped her passing was marked by peaceful dreams . <p> She took her life , Abigail said . <p> Jumped in the river and drowned , Caroline said . <p> There was no river , Mother , Abigail said . <p> Took a great notion , Caroline said . <p> In fact blew her brains out , Abigail said . <p> The river is a figure of speech , Caroline said , her voice booming so that Moses imagined it could be heard all across the graveyard . She continued , even louder : We swim in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every last one of us . It is the river of death , dear friends . <p> She was long distressed , Mosey , Abigail said quietly . You must have perceived it . <p> He had not . Annabelle had seemed , if not joyful , prone to joy . A buoyant spirit . Chosen by Jesus . And what a voice . Dear Lord , that woman could sing her heart out , then sit down at the pump organ and make those pipes wheeze into breath . <p> An imbalanced soul can go under at any time , Caroline said , looking at him pointedly . <p> Amen , he said . <p> She was my baby daughter , and I loved her . <p> I 'm very sorry , Moses said . I loved her , too . <p> Your love did nothing for her . <p> Do you still play the violin , Mosey ? , <p> He nodded , the March wind biting his cheeks . He was feeling the force of Caroline 's charge . Of course his love had done nothing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had the love of her real-estate developer done any more ? The name he 'd given her , Moses noted with some little satisfaction , had not even been cut into the tombstone . <p> I 've given up the clarinet , Abigail said . Music delivers us up to sin . <p> Bosh , Caroline said . <p> It seemed to me , Abigail said , that when Annabelle died I was being judged . <p> It was her business and hers alone . <p> We 're implicated , though , Mother . Surely we 're all implicated . Bosh . Hogwash . <p> Abigail smiled and turned again to Moses . Why are you here , Mosey ? Who has died ? <p> He told her , but she had never met Uncle Ezra , claimed not even to know Moses had an uncle . He believed he had spoken of Uncle Ezra many times . She had simply forgotten . Why , after all , should she remember ? <p> I remember everything , though , she said , touching the sleeve of his overcoat . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to him , forcing her daughter to stand aside . The rest of us wade , she continued . I know the moment . The moment she jumped , I was walking up Charles Street <p> Philadelphia ? <p> Baltimore , Charles Street is in Baltimore . I was near the Peabody Institute . An old , venerable district . Ahead of me , Mount Vernon Place with its monument to George Washington . I thought of my husband 's grave , as I always do when I see the monument in Mount Vernon Place . I did not love my husband . You must know this . Nor did he love me . We were well-suited to one another . He it was that designed this monument to himself and had it erected . I marvel that he remembered to include our names . <p> Mother , Moses does not care about all that . <p> But Moses did . He did n't remember Caroline ever mentioning her long-lost husband . He had been curious , but too tactful to ask . It was interesting now to hear these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I studied at the Peabody Institute , Caroline said . He was my teacher . When his bow struck the cello 's strings , a great coldness came to my heart . Lacking talent , I mistook this coldness for love . On the day Annabelle died , though I climbed the hill to Mount Vernon Place , a narrow street lined by row houses and shops and taverns , I felt suddenly as though I stood in the middle of a vast plain . And I heard then my husband 's voice . I had not heard it since his death sixteen years before , understand , not once , and I had been listening . On this day I heard it , though , the first of many times . It was like water in a stream , splashing against rocks , rushing to the sea . It roared and gushed like a song , a bad song , badly sung , rising from the glistening rocks , the swift water . Bury me not on the lone prairie . This world is not my home . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to this treeless plain ? I was his young bride , and it was his will that we leave Baltimore . It was shame that drove him , shame and ambition . Shame for himself , leaving behind a stout wife growing long in the tooth and three pious sons in order to marry me in the first flush of my youth ; ambition also for himself , the promise of glory in an innocent country . Land , he said to me . We will start anew , dearest Caroline . This is the promised land , my foolish new husband said . This is where a man 's past counts for nothing , and his abilities are everything . <p> Small abilities . Men of meaner spirit won out , as they always do . He should have clung to what he had , shamed or not . Am I so shameful ? I ask you , Moses Rosen , was loving me so shameful ? <p> Moses shook his head . No , he said . <p> I ca n't hear you , she said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an aging man , desperate for glory . <p> I remember my father as a sweet man , Abigail said . He held me in his lap and told me stories . He hugged me and he smelled like new-mown grass and his whiskers scratched my cheeks and I felt that nothing could ever hurt me . <p> A bitter man , Caroline said , an apartment-dweller that never mowed an inch of grass nor blade of hay . I knew that his message to me that day in Charles Street could hold no joy . The odor of decay came to me . The knowledge of my baby daughter 's death . Word reached me the next day , but I already knew . <p> She paused , as if to let her words have their full effect , and indeed they seemed to Moses to reverberate , rival even the wind in their persistence and bite . <p> I believe , Moses said , in the existence of many unexplained phenomena . <p> When neither woman responded , he added , thinking ( God help him ) suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a honky-tonk singer : Miracles happen . <p> And so , he suddenly realized , I have not lost my faith after all . I can speak without irony of miracles . Love has done this much for me . <p> Caroline looked away as if he had insulted her . <p> Abigail took a deep breath . Father 's monument , she said , may well be a bit excessive . I concede that , Mother . It does suggest a certain . . . egotism . Mosey , it 's so nice to see you again . You will call on us , wo n't you ? At the Colcord . <p> He would . He gave his solemn promise . It would be a pleasant distraction , and-who could say ? - maybe more . Could it be that here , in these great loves of the past , lay the real thing , the miracle , bestowed upon him with the blessing of Uncle Ezra from heaven above ? The force of his old love , especially for Caroline , came back to him ; he could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tingling hands . Such powerful oratory-eloquence , really . Always she had had a way with words . And that look she was giving him now-was he wrong in seeing a glimmer of the old affection , a recognition , a beckoning ? Surely she had at the very least forgiven him , her Annabelle dead these five years . Now she was looking at him again , her expression unmistakably kind . <p> We are watched , she said to him . There are guards at the gate . Spies everywhere . But you already know this . <p> Guards ? What did he know about guards or spies ? Gate ? What gate ? <p> No need to dissemble , sir . As one of them , you 'll certainly be allowed to enter . <p> Abigail was frowning and shaking her head . <p> Oh , I do n't expect you to acknowledge complicity , Caroline went on cheerfully . Of course not . Please , do n't worry . We 'll go on as always , keep up appearances-always advisable in dire circumstances . Do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll neither cooperate nor obstruct , at least not intentionally . <p> She took off her glove and extended her hand . He removed his own glove with some difficulty , tossed it to the ground , and clasped her hand . Seeing her close up , he was struck for the first time by how she had aged , and , glancing again at the tombstone , calculated that she was fifty-four , nineteen years his senior . Yet at twenty he had loved her , not knowing her exact age , not caring to know . Equipped with ear trumpet and clay pipe , she seemed in those days to want to appear older than she was . Now the lines in her face , the hollowed-out eyes , the gauntness , the looseness of skin beneath her neck , made her advanced age disconcertingly plausible . <p> I know you are a gentleman , at any rate , Caroline said . <p> Thank you , he said , though he was n't certain it was meant as a compliment , the way she quickly withdrew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind at his back , he imagined again that the renewal of this old love-the possibility of its renewal-and the suddenness of its reclaimed force evinced a higher power at work , and he went calling on the two ladies from his past that very evening . His strong impression , from the moment they met him at the door , was that , in manner at least , they seemed after these fifteen years no worse for the wear . <p> Abigail , artfully humble , drew him out with questions about his music , its progress ( she assumed ) and its continued importance in his life . Caroline sat quietly off to the corner , much as in those months when he had called on Abigail with his violin-no pipe in her mouth now , but her long , pale hands working at knitting needles , a garment of some kind taking shape on her lap . She looked a little younger than in the afternoon at the graveyard , the lines on her face more like shadows , enhancing somewhat the effect of her high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the harsh afternoon light and the necessarily dreary atmosphere that had made him see her as aged . She did not speak of guards or gate , and her expression as she watched him , though attentive , did not seem unduly searching . He would not have been surprised had Abigail produced a clarinet , despite her earlier pronouncement that she no longer played . <p> He had not , of course , brought along his violin . The idea had crossed his mind , though . <p> Abigail , like her mother , seemed to have grown younger since the afternoon , younger even than the version of her that he remembered . It might have been the dim light : a single electric bulb shielded by a thick , opaque glass shell resting atop a brass pole in the corner opposite Caroline 's chair-an overstuffed chair , not a rocker . But then he became aware of Abigail 's legs , exposed beneath a short , pleated skirt , and had the thought that , after all , her apparent youthfulness simply reflected the fashion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , ladies had not seen fit to expose more than a hint of their anklesa false modesty , no doubt . Moses , though hardly a puritan , recalled with fondness the days of the voluminous folds of skirt , the swish of crinoline , the peeking out from beneath of the small feet in their , for the most part , plain brown leather shoes , hooked or buttoned-why , you had to use your imagination back then . You still did with Caroline , he noted , her dark skirt draping to her ankles . <p> And what was wrong with using your imagination ? Now Abigail 's legs , shining even in the dim light , seemed meant for display , brazen enticements , pink protuberances gift-wrapped in silk . Yet they were large , tumescent , and had her ankles always been so thick ? He felt his cheeks flush . He cleared his throat . He recognized all too clearly the drift of his thoughts : He had been appraising her , had been on the verge of summing up the extent of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was talking aboutand looked at him pointedly . Had she asked a question ? He thought not . Probably she merely waited for him to do his part , as if their talk were a variation on the duets they used to play . He felt his cheeks flush , remembering missed notes , botched timing . <p> And how is your clarinet ? he asked . <p> My clarinet ? Abigail said . <p> Black , Caroline offered . Long and dark . Long gone . <p> I believe I told you I 'd given it up , Abigail said . <p> I thought , he said absurdly , you might still have it-in your possession , I mean . <p> In my possession ? Why , what on earth for ? To remind me of my former sinfulness ? <p> Moses is a businessman , dear , Caroline said . It may be that he wishes to sell it for you . <p> Of course . I 'd forgotten . A dealer in damaged goods . <p> Not damaged , no , he said . Rarely damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for business reasons . <p> He did not know why he 'd asked , and he certainly regretted bringing it up , but on this point he believed himself unimpeachable . <p> I did n't come here in the hope of financial gain , he said , with some heat . <p> Caroline would not let up . In your business , she said , the knitting needles clicking like a metronome , quarter note at about eighty-five beats per minute , andante . . . In your business I believe it 's the condition of the seller that matters , is n't it ? The seller must be in sufficient despair , in dire need . This keeps the loan low and , in the absence of redemption , the profit high . <p> He winced , but reflected instantly that , after all , there was some truth to her well-turned phrases-certainly this was the popular view of his occupation-and her tone of voice had been so sweet , her smile as she spoke so appealing , that he chose not to take offense . <p> I regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a higher one . <p> Business is business , Abigail said . In that regard it resembles marriage . You 've married , of course , Mosey , have n't you ? A good alliance ? A comfortable arrangement ? <p> Marriage does not ward off despair , Caroline quickly said , before he had a chance to answer . If you expect it to , you will be keenly disappointed . Marriage courts despair , dear . <p> As you 've often told me , Mother . <p> Truthfully , from the bottom of my heart . <p> I have n't married , Moses said . Have you , Abigail ? <p> Neverl I 'd as soon have kept my clarinet . <p> Despair is our proper condition , Caroline said . Marriage , you see , has its role in the scheme of things . <p> Annabelle married , Moses said . I hope she was happy in her marriage . <p> She was not happy , Caroline said . <p> Judge not , Mother . <p> She always struck me-I hope you 'll not take offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful one among you . I expected her to be happy and prolific . She did bear children , did n't she ? <p> You know very well the answer to that question , sir , his poor , sad , demented , ever-desirable Caroline said . He did not know the answer to the question , of course not , having had no commerce with the dead sister after she reported to him her marriage to the land baron of Topeka . <p> There were no children , Abigail said . <p> Save the one born dead , Caroline said . <p> Born dead ? Moses asked . <p> Your bastard boy , mister , Caroline said . Moses Junior . Or is it Moses the Third , the Fourth . <p> Moses did not understand . His bastard boy ? Moses Junior ? <p> Mother , Abigail said . Do n't talk foolishness . <p> Foolishness ? It 's God 's truth I talk . Moses Junior , dead in the water : <p> What Moses Junior ? Moses asked .

He hardly knew who was president anymore , but back then , influenced by Uncle Ezra , he had taken a mild interest in such things . <p> Or had it been the departure of Caroline and Abigail marked by the image of William Howard Taft on the front page of the Daily Oklahoman ?

He did not recall that it had arisen , unless in the abstract . Admittedly , his memory was faulty . Fourteen years , possibly fifteen , had passed . It was true that , like Caroline , he had taken a rather dark view of matrimony , and feasible that he had discussed his views with her , for they talked of many things .

She , too , had stood , and the two women faced each other , a hair 's breadth from Moses : mother and daughter , there was no mistaking it ; he had never been so keenly aware of how Abigail reproduced features of Caroline-the sharp nose , for example , the slightly puffy lower lip . Annabelle , too , was there , almost tangible , her breath mingled with her mother 's and sister 's , her chin visible in Abigail 's face , her cheeks in Caroline 's . <p> You 're one of them , Caroline said to her daughter . <p> Christ , Abigail said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but coming as it did from Abigail .

The needles could be dangerous , he saw , almost like weapons , removed as they were from their yarn . Should he propel himself between the ladies ?

Oh , he could love them again , all right , leap to his death into those soft laps , though he knew as little of them now as when he loved them first-daughter , then the mother , then the other daughter . <p> A person came to you with a history , he thought with some amusement , just as did the various objects brought to him for pawn . You could only guess , looking from outside , seeing the exterior , trying , from your knowledge of similar objects and your experience with same , to guess at the overall life , what was left of it that might be used , serve a purpose , give pleasure , even if not the pleasure or purpose it was intended for . Many times he had been deceived , tricked by gloss or sheen into paying more than market value , or else suckered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integrity , the honor , the need and sorrow of the lendee , the truth and justice of her woeful tale . <p> The truth , Caroline said . Tell him the truth , daughter of mine . Hush , Mother , and I will . <p> Caroline picked up her knitting and smiled-demurely , he thought , quite appealingly-oh , there was plenty of life in the old girl yeti And Abigail , crossing her comely , plump , much-exposed silk-glazed legs , a gesture somehow as dainty as it was brazen , accompanied by a swishing sound most pleasing to the ear , her lips simultaneously tightening ( reminiscent of how she 'd employed those supple cheek muscles in the service of the clarinet , taking its ebony mouthpiece into the dark of her mouth , letting her tongue lap against the reed ) . . . Abigail looked as truthful and seductive as an old gold timepiece . <p> Mosey , she said , the truth is that Annabelle bore no one 's son . <p> She cast an expectant look at her mother , who lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word . <p> I do n't understand , Moses said , and that was certainly the truth . Could she be suggesting a virgin birth ? <p> Annabelle , Abigail continued , Annabelle , to our knowledge-we were not with her constantly , of course , during those years , nor in constant touch-but we are fairly certain that Annabelle never married . That she told you otherwise , well , she must have had her reasons . <p> So there was no son ? <p> There was a son , Abigail said . <p> Your bastard boy , Caroline said softly . <p> Then ... ? <p> Abigail sighed , looked again at her mother . <p> The boy in question , Abigail at last said , would not have been my nephew . He would have been my brother . <p> Caroline bowed her head . Moses believed she was sobbing , though quietly . <p> Mother has not been right ever since , Abigail said . She rose and went to Caroline , leaned over her and caressed her , saying , There now , Mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all right . <p> Caroline drew away , though , pushing Abigail to one side and standing , crouching slightly , clutching her needles , her feet planted firmly apart as if she meant to leap up through the ceiling . She looked like her old self , Moses thought , and he felt a rush of admiration that might almost have passed for love had he been younger . After all , this woman was , it dawned on him-it had the beat of truth , Lord help usthe mother of his son , his dead son . <p> They took him from me , she said . Moses , my dear love , they took our son away from me . <p> And she rushed to him , propelling herself into his chest so that there was nothing but to take her in his arms , which he was glad to do , wanting to comfort her , have mercy , wanting her , this creature as desirable as ever she was , though surely crazed ( as who would not be ) , deranged by desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willfully to her death . <p> Dear , dear , dear , he said , hugging her to him , feeling at the same instant a sharp pain in his side , knowing even as he lost his balance , his strength suddenly vanishing , that he would fall a long , long way before it would be given him to understand whether any new life was left in him and for what possible purpose . Caressing her in order to keep himself upright as well as to express his undying affection , he felt that he took himself into his arms , his former and present self , and knew himself lost , beyond love , fallen into some hopeless future , unredeemed and unredeemable . <p>
