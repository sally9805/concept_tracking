If you develop your chest , will your breasts become smaller ? ... and more of your questions answered here . // Q If I do strength training for my chest muscles , will I lose breast size ? I want to be toned but definitely do not want smaller breasts . A No , developing your pecs wo n't make your breasts smaller . In fact , says Detroit trainer Neil Maki , a spokesman for the American Council on Exercise , " doing quality chest exercises will tone the muscle underneath the breast tissue , so your chest may appear to be bigger . " In female bodybuilders , steroid use can cause the breasts to shrink . And the combination of extremely well-developed chest muscles and very low body fat can make a woman 's chest appear less rounded , more flat and sculpted . But in the typical woman , strength training has an overall toning effect . If , however , you lose significant body fat , you may reduce breast size , but the decrease will be proportionate to fat loss from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find the recumbent bike more comfortable than other machines . Is it really a good way to burn calories and tone up ? After 10 minutes on the stair climber or elliptical trainer , I 'm exhausted and want to quit . A As long as you get your heart rate into the aerobic zone , you 'll burn plenty of calories and boost your cardio fitness on the recumbent . " Your heart does n't know the difference between the recumbent bike and the stair climber , " says Tom Seabourne , Ph.D. , director of kinesiology at Northeast Texas Community College , Mount Pleasant . The stair climber and elliptical machines , however , may burn more calories , on average , and provide a greater aerobic benefit . This is because you 're using a larger percentage of your muscle mass and you 're supporting your body weight when working out on these machines . However , if you 're so tired that you ca n't last more than a few minutes , you wo n't get much benefit from the workout . " The whole point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Seabourne says , " so hopefully you can last longer and push harder . " In general , pedal at a level where you 're just below breathless , Seabourne recommends . But twice a week , include intervals in your workout : For about 10 seconds , crank up the intensity so that you feel winded and your legs burn , then return to a comfortable pace until you feel recovered . Then sprint again . Or , if you 're watching TV as you pedal , speed up for the length of one commercial . As you become more fit , you 'll last longer at higher intensities . Although the recumbent bike is great for cardio fitness and burning calories , only strength training will provide the muscle tone you 're seeking . Lifting weights also can help you lose weight by increasing your metabolism . " For every pound of muscle you develop , you 'll burn about 50 extra calories per day , " Seabourne says .

I 'm not much of a runner and do n't want to get injured or flunk the test . Where do I begin ? A " The test might sound daunting , but you wo n't have any problem , " says Gainesville , Fla. , track coach Dave Milliman , managing director of the United States Track Coaches Association . The key is to avoid overtraining . For the first month , simply increase your activity level so that you 're in the habit of exercising five or six days a week , whether it 's swimming , volleyball or step aerobics . The second month , start a walk/run program , completing no more than two miles five days a week . Start by walking three  --  quarters of the total distance and running one-quarter . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of running at a comfortable pace . Gradually increase your running and decrease your walking so that you do equal amounts of each . At the beginning of the third month , time yourself on a two  --  mile run . If you ca n't complete the run in 19:30 , increase your distance slightly but not your intensity . " The mistake people make is going out really hard , and then they ca n't move for three days , " Milliman says . " To train for this test , you never need to go hard . Run at a pace where you can easily talk . " Continue your walk/run program throughout the third month , increasing your running until running comprises two-thirds of your workout . Every third workout , run one to two consecutive miles . On the two days before your test , do n't run or walk , and you should be plenty well-rested . Q My hamstrings are so inflexible that I ca n't touch my toes without pain , but I find stretching exercises really boring . How many minutes a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it take me to comfortably touch my toes ? A How quickly you gain flexibility depends on your age , your genetics and the flexibility you had as a kid . In general , exercise physiologist Tom Seabourne says , people age 25 and under tend to gain flexibility more quickly than people who are older , and those who were Gumby-like in childhood tend to have greater potential for flexibility as adults . Regardless of your past experience , Seabourne says , if you stretch daily , " you 'll definitely see improvements in two months . " To stretch your hamstrings , sit on the floor with your legs straight in front of you . Exhale as you bend from your hips , bringing your chest toward your knees . Do n't round your back to bend forward ; keep your back flat . If you do round your back , you 'll be able to reach farther , but you 'll be stretching your lower back instead of your hamstrings . Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds to the point of mild discomfort but not pain . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've warmed up your muscles with at least five minutes of cardiovascular exercise , preferably at the end of your workout . Stretching may never seem exciting , but once you get into the habit and start noticing progress , you 'll be more motivated to continue .

Q I 've never run more than three miles before but would love to feel the accomplishment of completing a marathon . Is this a realistic goal , and how long do I need to train ? A Assuming you do n't have any injuries , you realistically can train for a marathon in six months , says Tampa , Fla. , marathon coach Dror Vaknin , head coach for the Sun Coast chapter of The Leukemia &; Lymphoma Society 's Team in Training program ( team intraining.org ) . " About 85 percent of the people I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Though you can do it in six months , 12-18 months of training is optimal for attaining your peak endurance . For a novice , the best thing to do is get involved in a local training program , says Mindy Solkin , a USA Track and Field certified running coach and head running coach at Reebok SportsClub/NY . Contact your local city marathon or running club ( do an Internet search for a club in your area ) or join a program like Team in Training . Solkin says the quality of that program - or any program  --  depends on the individual coach , but one good thing about it is that it caters to beginners . Plus , in a program , you 'll train with other novices . " Support and encouragement is key , " Vaknin says . " You might have as many as 30-40 people to train with . That 's a lot easier than walking out the door yourself . " For your first marathon , Vaknin says , expect to mix some walking in with your running .

A " You should be applauded for wanting to make changes now rather than waiting , " says Detroit trainer Neil Maki . " Changing your lifestyle only gets tougher as you get older . " Find time two or three times a day to walk for just 10 minutes at a brisk pace , maybe before school and then before and after band practice . ( It 's a myth that you need to do 20 or 30 consecutive minutes of cardio exercise . ) Even before you notice physical changes , you 'll feel a boost in your energy and self-esteem , Maki says .
