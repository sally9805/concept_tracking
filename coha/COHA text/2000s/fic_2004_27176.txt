David Slate reached across the tiny table in Bistro Bis and handed an envelope to the graying man with the stiff burr haircut . " You are now Carl Mankin , " Slate said . " You are newly retired from the Central Intelligence Agency . You are currently employed as a consultant for Seamless Weld . Along with your new credit card , Carl , that envelope holds a lot of authentic-looking stuff from Seamless . Business cards , expense account forms  --  that sort of material . But the credit card should cover any expenses . " " Carl Mankin , " the burr-haired man said , inspecting the card . " And a Visa card . ' Carl Mankin ' should be easy to remember . And by next Tuesday , I actually will be newly retired from the CIA . " He was older than middle age , well past sixty , but trim , sunburned , and young looking . He sorted through the papers from the envelope and smiled at Slate . " However , I do n't seem to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I 'll bet you did n't expect to find one , either . The senator works on the old-fashioned ' gentlemen 's agreement ' contract . You know , ' Your word 's as good as your bond . ' That sounds odd here in Washington these days , but some of the old-timers still like to pretend there is honor alive among the political thieves . " " Remind me of what that word is , then , " the new Carl Mankin said . " As I remember it , you buy my time for thirty days , or until the job is done . Or failing that , I tell you it ca n't be done . And the pay is fifty thousand dollars , either way it works out . " " And expenses , " Slate said . " But the credit card should cover that unless you 're paying somebody to tell you something . " He chuckled . " Somebody who does n't accept a Visa card . " Carl Mankin put everything back into the envelope , and the envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually pays the credit card bill ? I noticed my Carl Mankin address is in El Paso , Texas . " " That 's the office of Seamless Weld , " Slate said . " The outfit you 're working for . " " The senator owns it ? That does n't sound likely . " " It is n't likely . It 's one of the many subsidiaries of Searigs Corporation , and that , so I understand , is partly owned and totally controlled by A.G.H. Industries . " " Searigs ? That 's the outfit that built the offshore-drilling platforms for Nigeria , " said Carl Mankin . " Right ? " " And in the North Sea , " Slate said . " For the Norwegians . Or was it the Swedish ? " " Owned by the senator ? " " Of course not . Searigs is part of A.G.H. Industries . What are you getting at , anyway ? " " I am trying to get at who I am actually working for . " Slate sipped his orange juice , grinned at Carl Mankin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have told me that , do you ? " " I think you could guess . You 're the senator 's chief administrative aide , his picker of witnesses for the committees he runs , his doer of undignified deeds , his maker of deals with the various lobbyists  --  " Mankin laughed . " And need I say it , his finder of other guys like me to run the senator 's errands with somebody else paying the fee . So I surely do think you could make an accurate guess . But would you tell me if you did ? " Slate smiled . " Probably not . And I am almost certain you would n't believe me if I told you . " " In which case , I should probably make sure to get my pay in advance . " Slate nodded . " Exactly . When we finish lunch , and you pay for it with your new Visa card , we 'll go down to the bank I use . We transfer forty-nine thousand five hundred dollars into Carl Mankin 's account there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the other five hundred ? " Slate got out his wallet , extracted a deposit slip , and handed it to Carl Mankin . It showed a Carl Mankin account opened the previous day with a five-hundred-dollar deposit . Mankin put it in his shirt pocket , then took it out and laid it on the table . " An account opened for an imaginary man without his signature . I did n't know that could be done . " Slate laughed . " It 's easy if the proper vice president calls down from upstairs and says do it . " " We need to be clear about this , " Mankin said . " You want me to go out to that big Four Corners oil patch in New Mexico , look it over , see if I can find out how the pipeline system out there was used  --  and maybe still is being used  --  to bypass paying royalty money into the Interior Department 's trust fund for the Indians . Does that about summarize the job ? " Slate nodded . " That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is the names of those switching the stuff around so the money for it goes into the right pockets . And who owns the pockets . " " And the senator understands that this is likely to produce nothing . I presume it is one of a whole bunch of ways he 's looking for some way to pin the blame , or the corruption , on somebody for that four- or five-billion-dollar loss of royalty money from the Tribal Trust Funds . The one the Washington Post has been writing about for the past month . The one the Secretary of Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs honchos are in trouble over . " Slate was grinning again . " Was that intended as a question ? What do the press secretaries say to questions like that ? " He slipped into a serious , disapproving expression . " We never comment on speculation . " " The newspapers say that this ripping off the four billion or so of Tribal royalty money has been going on for more than fifty years . And they 're quoting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much hope of me finding anything new ... " Continues ...
