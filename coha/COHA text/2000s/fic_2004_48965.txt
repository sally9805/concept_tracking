In general , F &.SF; readers are probably familiar with Plann O'Brien 's The Third Policeman and thus understand the value of a good footnote . Here we bring you a new tale of the Silurian age , one in a rather academic vein . Steven Utley reports that while the long-anticipated book of Silurian Tales is not yet in the works , a story collection entitled The Beasts of Love is in the pipeline and is expected to emerge next year . <p> AS AFICIONADOS OF DOCUmentaries and attentive readers of Sunday supplements know , the Paleozoic expedition 's main camp sits upon the verge of an estuarine marsh bracketed by barren headlands . Within the labyrinthine jumble of rocky debris along the base of the nearer ridge , a singular limestone slab stands as though balanced upon its edge in an area like a miniature arena . Unlike the camp 's other points of interest , it is omitted from the official catalogue . Yet significant numbers of visitors to the Paleozoic eagerly negotiate the enclosing maze for the sake of inspecting it . Some few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and require extrication , occasionally by air ( the camp maintains a helicopter for this purpose ) , while others wander through the maze and emerge without glimpsing that which they sought . ( From time to time , guideposts and monitoring devices have been installed , but someone always removes or disables them . Attempts to identify and apprehend this vandal have failed . ) Those who successfully penetrate the maze find themselves before an extrusion of vibrant red and orange , fluorescent yellow , metallic blue , shiny green : riotous , startling , illicit color - in marked contrast to the materially identical limestone masses ranged about it ( indeed , to the drab Paleozoic world in general ) . The finely grained stone typical of the region provides a suitable , albeit slightly undulating , surface for a variety of more or less indelible markers , including paint sticks , grease pencils , jet pens , charcoal , and chalk , as well as pocketknives and other implements according to one visitor , " You can scratch it with a paper clip , it 's so soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the slab has been covered with markings , until " the rock is embedded in graffiti like the pit in a peach . " 2 Much of the older graffiti has itself been deliberately obliterated , scrubbed off to make way for new graffiti or simply buried beneath fresh layers . Weathering and fading have also effaced many markings , moreover , at unequal rates , depending upon the graffiti 's placement and the means used to inscribe it . In consequence , the beginnings of many inscriptions unconformably abut the middles of others and the endings of still others . " There ca n't be five unaltered independent clauses in the lot . " 3 A geologist visiting the rock calls it " a perfect metaphor for geology . The old is obscured by the new , the new is partly erased , partly exposing the old . " 4 No less proprietarily , an historian likens it to palimpsests , the parchments erased and reused by ancient and medieval scholars . The rock is porous enough to retain traces of erased or obscured graffiti , which become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner become legible with a minimum of electronic enhancement . This process is , of course , beyond the means and intent of the casual visitor , who therefore must be content with superficial inspection.5 The graffiti consist of the usual things which people throughout history have privately inscribed in public places : names , initials , dates , jokes , bon mots , cartoons , declarations of love enclosed in hearts , invitations to engage in a variety of improbable sexual acts , mostly unsought and mostly unsound advice , quotations , insults , non sequiturs , trivia , esoterica , outright arcana , and verse in various forms and of debatable merit . " The neighbor 's sea scorpions are in the rosebushes again , " begins one poem . " There was a young lady from Dallas , " begins another . Perhaps inevitably , the enormous body of verse has inspired an attendant body of literary criticism , itself ranging in form and quality from the brief and facile " If it does n't rhyme/do n't waste my time " to a brambly critique of the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Herbert , and Abraham Cowley.6 An entire face of the slab is given over to a mass of graffiti consolidated under a heading painstakingly engraved by an unknown daredevil across the upper edge : QUANTUM METAPHYSICS 101 A twenty-first-century humorist who had undertaken the " obligatory pilgrimage " 7 to the rock , noted in his own , farcical expedition memoir that the chief topic of the forum , if it may be said to possess such , was the interface of science and art or science and faith or science and something else . What you made of it depended on what you thought you knew about what other people had thought they knew and still other people had thought of what those first people thought . It was mathematics and metaphysics/morphology in both the biological and linguistic meanings of the word , metopes and modem art , Mozart and mo-pop , Mohammed and his mountain , Mann and his mountain , the " many-worlds " hypothesis ( with monoversalists , multiversalists , and mimetoversalists biting at one another like cats , dogs , and fairly undiscriminating fleas ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mush . If you looked away for an instant , if you so much as blinked , you lost your place and never could find it again.8 He discovers that disagreement over basic terms has prompted a graffitist to append " Essential and Other Pertinent Definitions , " in the interest of promoting agreement on what we are talking about . Let us all concur that quantum theory " holds that energy is not absorbed or radiated continuously but discontinuously , in definite units called quanta , " while metaphysics , as used hereinafter , is intended to mean " the branch of philosophy that deals with first principles and seeks to explicate the nature of being or reality here the viewer is advised by footnote to see ontology , further down the rock and of the origin and structure of the world see cosmology and is closely associated with a theory of knowledge " see epistemology.9 Although , remarkably ( indeed , almost uniquely ) , the text enclosed within its rectangular border remains inviolate ( save for the insertion of several competing systems of footnote symbols ) , vehement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inspired to admiration of the rock by my discovery upon it of an example of a literary form that surely dates back to Sumer and for all scientists can tell us even to the Paleolithic . Anyone who has ever entered a public restroom will recognize it . This example commenced , " S.Y.S. loves E. remipes " ( S.Y.S. presumably being a paleontologist , E. remipes being an evidently popular species of sea scorpion ) , and proceeded as follows : Better E. remipes than E. coli . You know where you can put your E. coli ! HEY , WATCH IT-MY DOG 'S A BORDER COLl ! It 's pronounced kohl-i , not cah-lee . Drink Coca-Coli . I ALSO HAVE A PET VEGETABLE FROM THE COLI FAMILY . CAN YOU GUESS WHAT IT IS ? Broccoli . Coliflower7 . May Coli smite you all , jaw and thighbone , ass and elbow . If you ask me this whole discussion is pretty melancholi . AND DID WE ASK YOU ? Well ! I decided that if this was indicative of the material still awaiting my perusal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour at most . I confidently launched a frontal assault on that bastion of bewilderment titled " Quantum Metes &sychosis"; sic and promptly had to skirt an impenetrable line of fortifications comprising quotations from works of metaphysics ( some of them in the original German , and at least a few of the shorter ones lettered in Gothic script , rendering them all the more impervious to understanding ) only to find myself under a barrage of denigrations of abstract reasoning and the small-arms fire of dissertations on the relative incidences of " solitary vice " and general depravity among philosophers , paleontologists , and physicists . I came to a dead stop in a concertina-wire-like tangle of mathematical formulae , through which I could glimpse a patch of text on the far side , though I could make out only the terms " atemporality " and " aspatiality , " the lines , Here I sit , broken-hearted , Tried to quit But ca n't get started , and the desperate scrawl , " Help ! I 'm having a simultaneity breakdown ! " Without understanding for an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly how he or she must have felt.10 Permitted , or compelled , to read only more or less at random , other visitors also mention the impossibility of syncretism , one going so far as to describe the graffiti as quaquaversal , a term in geology meaning " directed from a common center toward all points of the compass or turning and dipping in all directions . " 11 Another observes that " these ostensibly serious exchanges inevitably degenerate into puerile nonsense , " and reproduces as an example the following exchange : Sirrah , you are a sorry sack of solipsism and a sciolistic one at that . I micturate mightily on your meandering , monotonous , meaningless , and maximally moronic musings on mathematics . Oh yeah ? ! Yeah ! Wan na make something of it ? FIGHT ! FIGHT ! OOOPS , I MEAN - SCIAMACHY ! SCIAMACHY ! " To which , " he says , " I confess I was sorely tempted to add Quantum sufficit ! " Enough already ! ' " 12 His collaborator springs to the defense : The graffiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am coming around to the view that they do serve a useful function - provide the expedition 's anarchists and jokers with an outlet for anti-social and anti-authoritarian sentiment , and so keep them from bloodily overthrowing local Officialdom . Therefore , I can only say to my esteemed colleague , whose pomposity , humorlessness , and priggishness fit him ideally for membership in Officialdom , Fac ut vivas ! " Get a life ! " 13 The graffiti have not lacked for either champions or detractors among expedition members , and , perhaps contrary to expectation , opinion is not divided strictly along the demarcation between its civilian and military members . A Navy officer describes a rather touching incident which , unknown to him at the time , was to have an unpleasant denouement : At midday , prickly heat engulfed the camp like amber , and people turned from the work or recreation that had occupied them throughout the morning and became , according to their natures , passive , lethargic , dormant , or perfectly inert . I was a newcomer , however , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see everything . I put a pith helmet on my head , salt tablets in my pocket , and a canteen on my belt , and struck out into blinding sunlight and palpable humidity to seek such adventure as the Silurian age could provide . I did not feel like climbing the ridge in that heat , however . I had overheard someone on the ship say that there was " interesting stuff " to see among the rocks strewn along its base , so I decided to investigate . .. . The going was tricky , but it was shady in there , and cool .... As I penetrated deeper , however , the air grew still ; if I had been perspiring freely before , now I was awash inside my slimy clothes . Then I stepped through a cleft and came unexpectedly upon a woman standing beside a graffiti-plastered slab of rock . She faced me but did n't see me because at that moment she had the front of her shirt pulled up so she could wipe sweat from her face , thereby affording me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of joints trying to get myself turned around within the cleft 's confines . I stuck fast for the moment and could only shut my eyes and stammer an apology . " It 's okay , " I heard her say , " you can look now , I 'm decent . " I risked a look and saw her regarding me with an expression of annoyance . I felt like one big hot blush , and that seemed to amuse her , for she abruptly cocked her hip and planted a fist on it , gave me an exaggerated wink , and said , " Hell-o , sailor ! " Then she suddenly blushed , and I realized after a moment that she had just then recognized my insignia . " Whoops , " she said , " sorry , I did n't realize , " and now I finally found my voice and told her no , I was sorry , I had n't realized , and we went on like that for perhaps half a minute . She laughed nervously and said , " Can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid eyes on each other for the first time ? That I never disconcerted you by blatantly calling attention to my womanly charms ? " " I 'm not disconcerted by womanly charms , " I said , and immediately thought , That must be the most inane sentence to come out of my mouth in my adult life . I tried to recoup by adding , " You 'd be surprised by what a Navy chaplain hears . " She laughed again . " Probably not as much as you 'd be surprised by what an old gal knows . " 14 Apparently in consequence of this flustered beginning , the two dispense with further attempts at introduction . I asked about the graffiti , and after a moment 's hesitation , she led me on a brisk circuit of the slab . " Every other rock in Paleozoic time , " she said , " is regarded as the scientific equivalent of a holy relic , untouchable by the uninitiated . But this one 's been singled out for a different use - a profane use , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members come to satisfy the hardwired human need to make marks on things . " Much of what I saw was the usual , by turns blasphemous , merely outrageous , or simply cretinous , but here and there was something clever , such as the protracted dialog between Maxwell 's demon and Schrdinger 's cat ( " MD : You okay in there ? SC : You go to hell ! " 15 ) . I had n't seen the word " consubstantial " in a graffito since divinity school . I would have stayed longer , but I became increasingly aware that she meant only to satisfy my curiosity and send me on my way as quickly as possible , so I thanked her and returned through the maze to camp.16 The following morning , the commander of the expedition 's Navy contingent ordered a work party to the rock . That much is indisputable ; accounts of what precipitated the order , what the order was , and what came of it do not simply vary but diverge to the point of flatly contradicting one another . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the graffiti ( " clearly it was an open secret " 17 ) , admitting only that he had mentioned it in passing to fellow officers . He also claimed that Dr. Maven had somehow never got around to explaining that she was studying the graffiti ( " She just said she 'd been taking pictures of it " 18 ) , and . that he had had no intention of making trouble for her or anyone else . A historian who accepts this , or at least does not reject it , writes : The definition of vandalism includes graffiti , so the commander was simply enforcing regulations - or ( already our path forks ! ) perhaps he was acting out of personal pique , having taken umbrage at either a vicious caricature of himself rumored to adorn the rock , or ribald verse directed at a civilian expedition member with whom he was known to be , or perhaps only rumored to have been , romantically involved , at some time , on some plane of being . Or not.19 In one instance , the offensive verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whom I 'd like to dress in leather And tickle , with a peacock feather . In a " sub-instance " of this development , the Navy commander denounces the " despicable doggerel " and acts the part of a protective lover ; in a second sub-instance , he denies any romantic attachment with the Professor Heather in question but feels it incumbent upon himself to act on her behalf . But ( ah ha ! ) the commander may just as well have been acting on the pique of one of his junior officers , who took umbrage at ribaldry directed at herself : The jay-gee is a sonsy wench ; I 'd lay her on a bunk or bench . If she liked , I 'd even spank her , But I 'm an enlisted wanker . The work party has n't even received its assignment , already we have half a dozen different versions of things , and we 're still well shy of the commander 's ultimately being dissuaded from having the rock ( A ) cleaned off , ( B ) pulverized , or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all expedition personnel or ( 2 ) Navy personnel only . To complicate matters further , no one is really sure just how he was dissuaded and by whom.20 In the event , one person , at least , was sure that she knew how and by whom - or , more precisely , if the imperfections of the Record of Proceedings21 can be said to allow for precision , that she could certainly find out . ( It is difficult to explain this record 's having been overlooked by King , whose reputation for meticulous research must now be reconsidered . ) According to the Proceedings , the work party was met at the site and deflected from its assignment by a female civilian named Maven who claimed the graffiti as the subject of her sociological research . By now , no one should be surprised to learn that conflicting accounts ensue . The petty officer in charge of the work party later admitted in proceedings that he had skeptically demanded to know what a sociologist might be doing in Paleozoic time , and claimed that the civilian had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , that the interview was concluded , and that the Navy should mind " its own goddamn business , whatever the hell that might be . " 22 She maintained in proceedings that while she may have indeed been curt with the petty officer , 23 she had answered his " impertinent " question comprehensively " and concisely : " I 'm doing what sociologists do anywhere there'are humans living together in social groups . " 24 In her published memoir of the expedition , however , she amplified this answer to make it more comprehensive , albeit less concise , presumably in the way of dramatizing exposition to make it more palatable to a popular audience whose attention was not altogether biddable.25 Now she goes on at length : " I 'm doing what sociologists do anywhere there is human society , people living together in groups . The grist for my particular mill is here , now , where we have a relative handful of people isolated from the rest of their species - isolated by four hundred million years , according to one theory , isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When the petty officer shrugs this off ( as well he might ) and demands to know why his superior officer did not know the site was under her protection , she informs him , " I try to keep a low profile here , " explaining , " .. . Back home , I can do oral-history interviews of former expedition members by the dozen and in broad daylight , but here I 'm trying to minimize my presence because I do n't want to make people self-conscious about what they write on the rock . I come here during the heat of the day or a little after sunrise or a little before sundown , take rubbings , photographs , do a complete three-sixty whenever it seems warranted , then clear out . " 26 Whatever really passed between protagonist and antagonist ( her memoir leaves no room for doubt as to who is who ) , the petty officer reported the incident to his superiors . A routine name check next failed to find Dr. Maven , which meant that her credentials could not be examined27 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in Paleozoic time under false pretenses . A jump-station technician volunteered the information that she had come through unaccompanied and carrying only a backpack . She had signed the register for use of the camp 's communal facilities , but so little had been seen of her since then that no one could quite recall her or had a clear notion of what she might by doing in their midst . By the time her personal data were recovered , she and Reklen , the civilian liaison , had already fought the first skirmish in what was to unfold as a lifelong exchange of libel and slander , culminating in a lawsuit and a suicide . It began when he ( " peremptorily " 28 ) summoned her to account for herself , and received the reply that she was busy and he should go fuck himself . This , probably as much and possibly more than anything else , precipitated the formal inquiry to which in later years she referred as both a court-martial and a provost court . The terms are neither quite interchangeable in military usage nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal inquiry - stressing " formal " as the operative word , as in " strictly for form 's sake . " A half-dozen of us , evenly divided between Navy and civilians , sat in a sweltering Quonset hut and asked her and the p.o. a few questions . I had no beef with her , unlike one of the civilians who instigated the whole thing " emphasis added.29 In the extant record , on being asked how long she thought the alleged vandalism had been going on , she answers , " Almost from the first ! " and names several well-known scientists , previously in Paleozoic time , whose initials she claims to have found carved or written on the rock . " Most of the inscriptions are anonymous or at least pseudonymous - signed things like Old Dude " and " Spangles " and so forth . Beyond doubt Navy personnel have contributed their share , just more discreetly than the civilians . " This elicits expressions of doubt and denial from the Navy officers , though apparently not from the petty officer or other ratings who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and a stern reminder from the civilian liaison that , " As visitors to this pristine primeval world , we should not go around defiling it , trashing it , or marking it up . " " The absence of trash , " she replies , " and the presence of art tell me that people respect the place very much . " 30 This prompts a rejoinder from the civilian liaison , that " to dignify graffiti by subjecting it to allegedly scientific scrutiny misrepresents scribblings and doodlings whose predominant characteristics are inanity , irreverence , and obscenity . Have human beings really come all this way , across hundreds of millions of years , just to snigger over smut ? " 31 A gap in the record occurs at this juncture . When the record resumes , visual exhibits have been brought forward , consisting of photographs of the limestone slab , taken from all sides at regular intervals . Careful examination of sequences of images reveals not only material of a pornographic or otherwise questionable nature , but also that all such graphic depictions of coitus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed , are soon effaced or , more frequently , revised into fabulous Paleozoic fauna or flora , e.g. , " Trilobite me " and " Cocksonia . " Scatological references and the like tend ( " puckishly " 32 ) to mutate into faux taxonomical terms . Even the English language 's most familiar expression of insolent ill regard proves vulnerable to this sort of revision . The latter of a particular pair of " before and after " images reveals a cartoon of a beStetsoned gun-toting sea scorpion appended to an inscription amended to read " Fuckeurypterid andthehorseurydon " ; another inscription has attracted the rejoinder , " You idiot , it 's F-U-C-U-S , " which segues directly into a brief technical description of an actual seaweed genus ofthat name . The Navy commander then asks , " Does it not seem from this that even some of the graffitists are offended by pornographic material ? That someone has appointed themselves sic censor ? " and receives the answer , " Emendation is n't restricted to the pornography . Anything you inscribe on the rock is fair game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares in conclusion that " the human need for self-expression is part of our baggage wherever we go-in this case , when ever-and it always finds an outlet . Voil . The rock , the outlet . " The Navy commander , by now patently weary of the whole matter , says , " So be it , " and summarily adjourns the proceedings over the civilian liaison 's protests.33 In Maven 's memoir , her succinct summation swells into a full-blown lecture : " ... The rock is vital - indispensable - to the expedition 's collective mental health in another way , too . It 's a safety valve . It 's not merely the major means , it 's virtually the onfymeans of genuine communication in your small , isolated , diverse , and segregated community.34 When not actually required to interact - as now , for example civilians and military personnel pretty much keep to themselves . When they do interact , they frequently confound one another . As now . Moreover , civilians and Navy personnel not only keep to themselves but to their hierarchical subgroups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Officers do not fraternize with ratings , of course . But , if they can help it , neither do field geologists and so-called black-box geologists fraternize . The astronomers and physicists look down - there is no other term to describe their attitude - look down on the geologists , who for their part emphatically do not look up to the astronomers and physicists . And everyone asks , as snidely as possible , what the hell a sociologist is doing here . " 35 This final sentence was excised prior to the memoir 's publication and appears only in the posthumously discovered version . But at last we seem to have arrived at the crux of the matter ! Anger and paranoia roil just beneath the surface of the published version ; they break through repeatedly in the original : The prospect of going in alone did n't daunt me . I liked working alone ; the only times I ever engaged graduate students or other assistants was when there was a lot of pure donkey-work to be done.36 I would have the use of communal facilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could just scrape together the price of a damn time-machine ticket ! In writing this memoir , I find I still am not quite capable of relating , in anything like an even-tempered ( let alone even-handed ) fashion , what I put up with , what I went through , to gain access to that strange other world . My grant requests elicited actual guffaws in certain quarters : " Sociology in the Silurian , bwah-hah ! " " The Silurian Period is no place for the soft sciences , hee-yuk ! " All these years later , those jackass brays of hilarity echo in my head.37 Her memoir 's coda is laced with bitterness but concludes on what must be described as a strangely subdued note : The inquiry wrecked my project as completely as though I had just let the swabbies at the rock in the first place . I 'd come to record and study and analyze , as unobtrusively as possible , remaining aloof from the mystagogic community of the rock while also respecting its unwritten , unspoken , yet unmistakable rules . How these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by breaking the one against spying . I had to accept that the protocols existed . You did not litter the space enclosing the rock with empty beer cans , broken glass , cigarette butts , and used condoms . You could disagree and even revise or erase someone else 's work , but you could not violate anyone 's anonymity or cause it to be violated ; you could n't spy on people . And it all went right down the toilet the instant the rock became a tourist attraction and I became a celebrity . After that , I could n't go into the labyrinth and come out again without tripping over half a dozen idiots who wanted to gab and gawk and have their pictures taken at the rock . Within the week , I packed up and shipped out , leaving work undone , puzzles unsolved , mysteries unfathomed , secrets unlearned . I also left my own inscription on the rock . ... I am in no way ashamed of what I did manage to accomplish , which was the best work I could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to carry through to the end . I told myself that when I got home , perhaps I would look around for another isolated - but less isolated - social group , perhaps at a research station in Antarctica , perhaps on a mission to Mars.38 She does not reveal what she inscribed , or even how she inscribed it , and it probably did not survive long , given the plastic nature of graffiti . This leaves the door opened wide for speculation . Her avowed enemy wastes few words : " Knowing her , it was probably " Up yours ! ' " 39 One author40 suggests , solely on the strength of its being written in pencil on the last page of her field notebook , a quotation from a work of fiction entitled " Lik , " by Vladimir Nabokov ( 1899-1977 ) : " Loneliness as a situation can be corrected , but as a state of mind it is an incurable illness .

Barnet 's Silurian Tales ( Putnam Holt Rinehart Winston Harcourt Brace and Jovanovich or Their Heirs and Assigns ) , which concentrates ( or tries to , through a fog of alcoholic self-pity ) on sexual escapades and drinking bouts .
