<p> Regarding " City looks to open park at Meigs in July " metro story , April 13 , I offer the following observations about what will and should be planted at Northerly Island . The political power of birds , soon to be landing and taking off on Chicago 's Northerly Island , can not be underestimated . <p> Northerly Island is literally going to the birds this spring . Chicago 's lakefront is considered the international " airport " for birds , as these solo " pilots " flying their own " planes " migrate through Chicago after spending winter in Central and South America on their way to northern United States and Canada . <p> Just as many people take vacations in the South during Chicago 's cold winters and travel through O'Hare Airport , birds do the same thing along Chicago 's lakefront and Northerly Island , using them as their own little airport of international travel , according to University of Illinois at Chicago biologist Dr. Joel Brown at a recent Grant Park Advisory Council/Grant Park Conservancy symposium . So Meigs Field will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> As we were told , trees on Northerly Island are essential for migratory birds . Varieties of white oak trees  --  our own Illinois state tree  --  are some of the most important trees for migratory birds because they harbor so many insects on which birds feed . <p> Further bolstering the argument that Northerly Island is essential as a bird habitat planted with many trees is its proximity to McCormick Place and Soldier Field . By attracting birds to Northerly Island , the trees will help them avoid colliding with McCormick Place and Soldier Field to their deaths . <p> These migratory birds are also going to be responsible for raising the awareness of our own state tree and helping to increase its presence in Chicago and at Northerly Island and further protect it from leaf-eating insects . <p> Birds are guided by the Lake Michigan shoreline , preferring not to fly over large bodies of water . Our lakefront area is essential for birds ' resting and feeding . The panel of bird experts , scientists , architects and bird rescuers came together for a discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Grant Park and Northerly Island on the importan= , t migratory flyway and to prove that an urban center like Chicago can still nurture nature and help it thrive . <p> Bob O'Neill , president , <p> Grant Park Advisory Council/ <p> Grant Park Conservancy <p> Why wait at museums ? <p> Regarding " Art Institute seeking to hike admission to $12 " ( April 13 ) : So , attendance seems to be down ? On Saturday , April 10 , my wife and I were wandering around downtown with my father , who was in from out of town . He wanted to go to the Art Institute . We walked over and found that the estimated wait time to get in ( no special show  --  just to wander around the museum ) was 45 minutes . Needless to say , we decided to do something else . I thought the new admission counters were supposed to take care of this . <p> This is n't the first time I 've decided against waiting in line at a Chicago museum . They 're losing a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission counters . A fee increase is only going to discourage us more . <p> Michael Levin , West Town <p> Youth center closing needed <p> Regarding " Do n't shut door on reforming youth , " featured letter , April 9 : The state is experiencing a historic budget crisis that is having a harsh impact on everyone . As a result of this crisis , difficult decisions are being made . The recommended 2005 budget for the Illinois Department of Corrections totals $1.17 billion , a decrease of $92.1 million from the 2004 appropriation . <p> Safety and security guide IDOC 's operations . Age , operating costs and capital costs are all taken into account . It makes sense to fully open newer , state-of-the-art centers , such as the Illinois Youth Center-Kewanee , to maximize efficiency potential . <p> Closing the Illinois Youth Center at St. Charles will produce a six-month savings of $11.7 million . Juveniles will be moved to other IDOC facilities as well as Kewanee . Kewanee 's per capita costs will decrease from $98,000 to $52,000 , which is less than the $56,160 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kewanee 's extensive treatment program is designed to reduce recidivism . All juveniles in need of mental health treatment are eligible for the Kewanee program , which can include nearly 64 percent of the youth currently at St. Charles . <p> Other juveniles will be directed through a program for community-based services as an alternative to incarceration . <p> Budget cuts are always difficult and often unpopular . The bottom line is the agency is facing a $92.1 million budget deficit . Despite these decisions , at no time will the safety and security of the agency be compromised . My commitment is to manage IDOC in an efficient , cost-effective manner with the highest degree of accountability to the citizens . <p> Roger E. Walker Jr. , <p> director , <p> Illinois Department <p> of Corrections <p> While Bush team fiddles . . . <p> What was the Bush administration doing prior to 9/11 ? Condoleezza Rice was having a hard time interpreting that " Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States " meant that Osama bin Laden would attack inside the United States . President Bush was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month long  --  giving away the budget surplus and concerning himself with banning stem-cell research . Attorney General John Ashcroft was busting doctors for dishing out pot to sick people , cutting the anti-terrorism budget and picking out curtains for nude statues . Vice President Dick Cheney was meeting with his secret energy policy panel ( nearly a dozen times as opposed to not once meeting with his anti-terrorism panel ) . And the FBI was still sorting and filing all the information from nearly a decade of the Republican-led witch hunt of President Bill Clinton . <p> Gee , I wonder how we got caught with our pants down ? <p> Paul Winkelmann , <p> Romeoville <p> Rice 's testimony rings hollow <p> After Condoleezza Rice testified before the 9/11 Commission , partisan pundits rushed to the microphones to proclaim that she had done a " good job . " <p> Did they mean she had done a good job accurately depicting the administration 's part in the events surrounding Sept. 11 and convincing the public that the White House had responded appropriately ? Or did they mean she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With the escalation in the frequency and intensity of warnings in 2001 , the Aug. 6 presidential brief should have triggered the highest state of readiness . The brief was not just a " historical perspective , " as Rice described it , but current information on FBI investigations of al-Qaida cells in the United States and warnings of hijackings . <p> Common sense dictated that immediate actions be taken to protect this country 's citizens . The pundits must have meant that Rice is a good talker . <p> Vicki Dow , Crystal Lake <p> Remembering fallen soldier <p> On Palm Sunday , Gurnee lost a fine young man when Pfc . Geoffrey Morris ' Humvee took a hit from a rocket-propelled grenade in the province of Anbar in Iraq obituaries , April 14 . I 'm sure most people of Gurnee share in the pride I feel for the ultimate sacrifice of this young Marine . I hope his family can somehow reconcile this terrible loss . <p> War is a terrible , brutal thing , and we sometimes lose sight of that . As a Vietnam veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the bravery and devotion to duty shown by average men and women . God bless the entire Morris family . <p> David L. Jennings , Gurnee <p> Offshore solutions <p> Most companies that move their manufacturing base offshore will give you one simple reason for doing so . They will tell you more or less that they are much like the consumer who shops around for a bigger bang for his dollar . <p> But now that consumers are also thinking like CEOs of manufacturing companies and looking at other possible foreign sources like Canada to buy the same American drugs outrageously priced here and forever being priced out of reach , we suddenly hear rumblings from drug companies that it is not safe to buy the very same drugs from Canada . In retrospect , one might say that American products being made offshore are dangerous to our economy via those lost manufacturing jobs . <p> Did n't somebody once remark , " What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander " ? <p> Walter Santi , Bloomingdale <p> Something 's fishy <p> AP report : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Fishing with Rowland Martin . " " The president and Martin released several big fish they caught Friday but kept the smaller ones for eating . " <p> I think I know where Bush came up with his tax policy . <p> Brian Browder , <p> Lincoln Square <p> MY TWO CENTS <p> " We walked over and found that the estimated wait time to get in ( no special show  --  just to wander around the museum ) was 45 minutes . Needless to say , we decided to do something else . A fee increase is only going to discourage us more . "  --  Michael Levin
