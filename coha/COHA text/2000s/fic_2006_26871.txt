The Best Halloween Ever Chapter One It was the principal 's idea , but it was the Herdmans ' fault , according to my mother . " Do n't blame Mr. Crabtree , " she said . " It was n't Mr. Crabtree who piled eight kids into the revolving door at the bank . It was n't Mr. Crabtree who put the guppies on the pizza . It was one of the Herdmans , or some of the Herdmans , or all of the Herdmans . . . so if there 's no Halloween this year , it 's their fault ! " Of course the Herdmans could n't cancel Halloween everywhere . That 's what I told my little brother , Charlie . Charlie kept saying , " I ca n't believe this ! " as if it was unusual for the Herdmans to mess things up for everybody else . It was n't unusual . There were six Herdmans  --  Ralph , Imogene , Leroy , Claude , Ollie , and Gladys  --  plus their crazy cat , which was missing one eye and half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature it ever had . It bit the mailman and it bit the Avon lady , and after that it had to be kept on a chain , which is what most people wanted to do with the Herdmans . I used to wonder why their mother did n't do that with them , but , after all , there weresix of them and only one of her . She did n't hang around the house much anyway , and you could n't really blame her  --  even my mother said you could n't really blame her . They lived over a garage at the bottom of Sproul Hill and their yard was full of what-ever used to be in the garage  --  old tires and rusty tools and broken-down bicycles and the trunk of a car ( no car , just the trunk )  --  and I guess the neighbors would have complained about the mess except that all the neighbors had moved somewhere else . " Lucky for them ! " Charlie grumbled . " They do n't have to go to school with Leroy like I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were spread out through Woodrow Wilson School , one to each grade , and I guess if there had been any more of them they would have wiped out the school and everybody in it . As it was they 'd wiped out Flag Day when they stole the flag , and Arbor Day when they stole the tree . They had ruined fire drills and school assemblies and PTA bake sales , and they let all the kindergarten mice out of their cage and then filled up the cage with guinea pigs . The whole kindergarten got hysterical about this . Some kids thought the guinea pigs ate their mice . Some kids thought the guinea pigs were their mice , grown gigantic overnight . They were all scared and sobbing and hiccuping , and the janitor had to come and remove the guinea pigs . All the mice got away , so I guess if you were a mouse you would be crazy about the Herdmans . I do n't know whether mice get together and one of them says , " How was your day ? "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Terrific ! " " So was that it , Beth ? " Charlie asked me . " The mice and the guinea pigs ? Was that , like , the last straw , and then everybody said , All right , that 's it , the last straw . . . no Halloween ' ? Was that it ? " " I do n't think so , " I said . " I think it was everything else . " There had been a lot of everything else because Labor Day was late , so school started late . Parents had an extra week to buy their kids school shoes and get their hair cut ; kids had an extra week to finish the fort or tree house or bike trail or whatever else they 'd been building since June ; and teachers had an extra week to pray they would n't have any Herdmans , I guess .... And of course the Herdmans had an extra week , too , to tear up whatever they 'd missed during the summer . That turned out to be a lot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always things you would expect them to do . The police guard at the bank said that he had seen them come in . " Ca n't miss them ! " he said . " So I went right over and stood by the big fish tank . I figure , if I see a bank robber coming I 'll defend the money , but if I see those kids coming I 'll defend the fish . " He shook his head and sighed . " Did n't occur to me to hang around the revolving door . " Nobody got hurt and everybody got out all right , but they had to call the fire department to take the door apart , and they had to close the bank till they got the door back up . The fire chief said he never saw anything like it . " Two kids , " he said , " maybe even three kids might go in that door at the same time to see what would happen , but this was eight kids ! What you had was one section of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door forward , could n't move it back , had to take it down ... unless , well , you could n't just leave them in there . " This was supposed to be a joke , but most people thought it would have been a great opportunity to shut the Herdmans up somewhere , even in a revolving door . It would have been a great opportunity , except that by then it was n't Herdmans in the door . It was eight different kids , including Charlie . " Why ? " my father asked him . " Why would you follow the Herdmans anywhere , let alone into a revolving door ? " Charlie shrugged and looked up at the ceiling and down at the floor and finally said he did n't know . " It was just that they were all around , " he went on . " There were Herdmans in front of us and Herdmans in back of us , and then Ralph said , Let 's see how many kids will fit in the door , ' and so . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his door , and the bank guard was mad because he picked the wrong thing to guard , but nobody blamed him . How could he know what the Herdmans were going to do ? Most of the time , I do n't think even the Herdmans knew what they were going to do .
