" So . . . how did your date with Brian go ? " Caira glanced up from the three-tiered wedding cake she 'd just finished icing and watched her best friend , Nikki , breeze in through the back entrance of her bakery . Blue eyes wide with anticipation , Nikki rubbed her palms together and grinned . " Tell me everything . I want all the juicy details . Every last drop . " Caira quirked her lips and gestured toward the cake . " Let 's just say I wo n't be making one of these for myself any time soon . " Nikki plopped herself onto a nearby stool and scrunched her nose . " Was it that bad ? " " I think the word bad is an understatement . " Caira brushed powered sugar from her fingers and continued . " Try painful . I spent hours listening to Brian recite stories about how wonderful he is , and then he intimately introduced my tonsils to his tongue when he tried to give me a good-night kiss . " Nikki bobbed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does think highly of himself . But he 's cute enough , and I heard he has a huge co- " With a wave of her hand , Caira cut her off . " If one can get past his overinflated ego , one might enjoy his other attributes . " She paused and carefully placed the groom onto the top layer of cake . " Unfortunately , I am not that one . " Caira stood back and admired the finishing touches on the wedding cake . As she adjusted the small groom figurine she sighed regretfully . Would she ever find her very own Prince Charming ? She 'd made enough cakes over the years to know other women discovered their true love . The one man they were destined to be with . Why could n't she ? Was she too picky ? Too set in her ideas of what qualities her Prince should possess ? Was it too much to want a man with deep soulful eyes that looked at you , not through you ? A man with long , midnight hair , a strong angular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body that oozed strength and sexuality . A man like the one in the portrait hanging in her living room . The one that had been handed down in her family for generations . With his blond hair , blue eyes , and boyish twin dimples , Brian was the antithesis of her ideal man . Surely Nikki knew that . Knitting her brow together , Caira glanced at her best friend . " Whatever gave you the idea that we 'd hit it off ? " Nikki shrugged . " He 's a wedding photographer . " She paused and waved her hand through the air . " And you own your own bakery shop specializing in wedding cakes . I just thought you had a common interest . " " The only thing we have in common is we both breathe oxygen . And for a while there I was n't even too sure about that . I had a sneaking suspicion he came from another planet . Planet Narcissist to be exact . " Nikki chuckled and jumped from her stool . " Come on , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up for it . I hear there 's a new boutique that opened up on Fifth Street and I 'm just dying to check it out . " Caira uncoiled the apron straps from around her neck and eyed her friend . " No more blind dates okay ? " She pulled the plastic clip from her nape , letting her blonde curls tumble over her shoulders . Nikki raised one brow , a wry grin curling her lips . " Not even if he has a huge co- " Groaning in exasperation , Caira nudged Nikki toward the back door . " No , not even if he has a huge cock . " She tossed her apron aside , and followed her friend outdoors . A short while later Caira found herself peering through the frosted , curbside door of a store called The Magic Boutique . She shadowed the afternoon sun from her eyes and turned to Nikki . " What is this place ? " Nikki shrugged . " Let 's go find out . " Tiny bells jingled overhead when she pulled open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small store was overcrowded with unique , antique items , rich in history , and undoubtedly , family secrets . Caira 's senses were immediately enticed by an exotic blend of jasmine and vanilla incense . Soft rays of light from an overhead beaded chandelier bathed the room in a golden glow , creating a cozy , somewhat mysterious atmosphere . Gusts of warm air from a ceiling fan rattled the dangling beads , the resulting noise similar to the soothing sound of raindrops falling on an old porch roof . Blinking her eyes to adjust to the dim light , Caira glanced around the room and noted the dark shadows dancing across the crimson-colored walls . " Come closer , ladies . " Caira and Nikki both turned in the direction of the aged , smoke-roughened voice coming from the other side of the room . In an attempt to avoid banging into any of the expensive items , they pressed their bodies together and carefully moved across the wooden floor until they found the old woman with the deep , gravelly voice . Dressed in a silk chiffon flamenco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , wrapped and knotted at the waist , the woman looked more like a traveling gypsy than a store owner . Sitting on an oversized stuffed chair , with her legs folded underneath her , she pressed her lips together and stared at Caira for a long silent moment . Her eyes bore into her with a gaze so intense and probing , Caira feared the woman could see into the depths of her soul . She found it most difficult to hold the woman 's stare . With weathered fingers the gypsy-woman lifted her hand and took a long , slow drag off her menthol cigarette . Tendrils of smoke billowed around her braided , waist-length gray hair . Not wanting to appear rude , Caira blinked the smoke from her eyes , weaved her fingers tightly together , and restrained herself from fanning the fumes away . When the woman finally spoke she leaned forward and said , " Ma Petite Princesse . It is you . You have come . " Did this woman somehow know her ? To Caira 's knowledge they 'd never crossed paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Caira asked .
