THIS LAND Headnote Vestiges of mining towns line a route into the central Yukon . // Canada 's northwesternmost territory , the Yukon , has just two major highways-the Alaska Highway , which runs east to west across the southern part of the region , and the Klondike Highway , which starts south of Whitehorse ( the territory 's capital ) and runs northwest through Stewart Crossing to Dawson City The great Klondike gold rush , which followed the discovery of gold along Bonanza Creek in 1896 , was responsible for making Dawson City a major town . Stewart Crossing is near Stewart Creek and Duncan Creek , where gold was discovered in 1895 and 1889 , respectively . Silver-rich deposits of galena , a lead ore , were mined in an area northeast of Stewart Crossing . The road leading there , which strings together the three towns of Mayo , Elsa , and Keno City , is still known as the Silver Trail . One cool August morning , my wife , Beverly , and I got an early start out of Whitehorse and followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that remain of Stewart Crossing . We then turned onto the Silver Trail , which at first follows the Stewart River upstream . After about two miles , our view of the river was obscured by a white spruce forest . The forest grows atop permafrost , a layer of soil that remains frozen year-round . A dense ground cover of mosses provides insulation during the summer , helping to preserve the permafrost below . Another ten miles or so down the Photograph View west from Keno Hill Photograph View west from Keno Hill Photograph Miner 's cabin // road , the landscape broadened into a floodplain , and twenty miles farther along , we saw a pair of low ridges . These are moraines-glacial deposits of sand and boulders-marking the western limit of glacial ice in the Stewart River Valley some 14,000 years ago , during the most recent ice age . East of here , geologist Christopher Burn has reported , the area was once covered by ice up to 1,500 feet thick . Just outside Mayo , thirty-six miles along the Silver Trail-about the halfway point-we reached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights . Mayo , which once boasted 30,000 inhabitants , now has about 500 . Nevertheless , it is the region 's center of activity . ( Elsa is nearly a ghost town , with less than half a dozen residents , while Keno City has about twenty-five . ) Coincidentally , Mayo holds the record for both the coldest and the hottest temperatures in the Yukon . In February 1949 , a low of - 80 F was recorded , while in June 1967 , the temperature rose to 970 E After we had spent the night , the host of our bed-and-breakfast drove us to Keno City . On the way , near the former settlement of Minto Bridge , we stopped to see a " drunken " forest of spruce trees tilted at various angles . The forest owes its appearance to an adjacent lake , one of a number of thermokarst lakes in the region . Such lakes originate from the melting of ice in the upper layer of permafrost ; in this case , according to Burn , the melting resulted from nineteenth-century forest fires . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deeper layers of permafrost beneath it , as well as the frozen soil around it , continue to thaw . As the banks of the lake collapse , the trees begin to topple . The trip to Keno City gave me the opportunity to see Keno Hill , which rises several hundred feet above the town . Reaching 6,755 feet above sea level , the top of the hill is above the timberline , and several plants unusual for this part of Canada grow here . A rough road leads up to the summit , passing first through one of the northernmost stands of alpine fir in the world . On the way up , we stopped to examine the roadside vegetation in this forest and again , above the timberline , to see a wet meadow and a dry meadow . Finally we reached the rocky summit , which harbors tiny flowering plants . In most of these species , the leaves are crowded into a compact " cushion " that protects them from the harsh , drying winds .

The shrub layer has western rose , // buffaloberry , northern comandra , and shrubby cinquefoil , while the ground is carpeted with both soft mosses and crunchy reindeer moss ( actually a lichen ) . Canada goldenrod and northern bedstraw are among the few wildflowers . " Drunken " forest consists mainly of black spruce , although there are also a few small willows . Common shrubs are shrubby cinquefoil , mountain cranberry , western rose , northern black currant , northern comandra , buffaloberry , and a dwarf raspberry . Along with a heavy ground cover of soft mosses are horsetails and such wildflowers as Ross 's avens , bluebells , sweet coltsfoot , a grass-of  --  Parnassus , a fleabane , and various sedges . Keno Hitt roadside vegetation includes native forest species such as white and black spruce , alpine fir , gray alder , trembling aspen , and Scouler 's willow . The creation of the road , however , has made an opening for other kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf , a stinging nettle , western dock , and the colorful fireweed . Wet meadows have abundant grasses , sedges , and rushes , while low  --  growing shrubs include black crowberry , mountain cranberry , shrubby cinquefoil , and three dwarf willows . Common wildflowers are a pink-flowered and a white-flowered bistort , Arctic shooting  --  star , three kinds of buttercups , Parrya nudicaulis , and Langsdorf 's lousewort . Rare for the Yukon are the tiny moschatel , Sitka valerian , and Epilobium lactiflorum ( a white  --  flowered , alpine willowherb ) . Dry meadows have less species diversity than the wet meadows . Arctic willow and Labrador-tea make up the shrub population . There are three kinds of saxifrages , including the rare alpine saxifrage . The purple-headed Siberian aster is common . Rocky summit species include the rather rare Huddleson 's locoweed , a three- to four-inch-tall , hairy white plant that produces pink-to-purple flowers and oversize seed pods . Other rarities are the dwarf , shrubby Diapensia lapponica , whose solitary creamy white flowers are borne above a cushion of evergreen leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalks nearly ten inches above the basal leaves . Among the common wildflowers are one  --  flowered cinquefoil , woolly lousewort , alpine willowherb , three saxifrages , and an Indian paintbrush . A matforming shrub known as white mountain heather has minute leaves crowded into four rows . The delicate fragile fern and the larger fragrant wood fern nestle in the crevices of the sheer cliff off the northern side of the summit .
