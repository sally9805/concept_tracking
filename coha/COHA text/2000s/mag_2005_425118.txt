/Jan 2006 REVIEW CONNIE KIENER Marghitta Feldman Gallery , Portland , OR * May 3-28 , 2005 Exulting in the glorious tradition of Italian maiolica , Connie Kiener presented functional wares and sculpture in this livelyexhibition titled " Mapping Worlds . " A colorful tile mural , Continental Drift , 2005 , depicting the United States map under stress , was also shown . In its 22-by-33-inch grid , Kiener posits a new kind of plate tectonics , in which the nation breaks apart along the Mississippi , New England crashes into a dislocated Italy , and Texas charges off on tank wheels towards Iraq . A pinwheel hurricane approaches California as a glowing orange China dawns over North Dakota like a rising sun . The six square tiles are slightly warped , so that the mural itself echoes the unstable , changing nature of what it portrays . Photograph Connie Kiener 's works , both 2005 , are maiolica , handbuilt and painted with fluxed oxides .

The exotic theme recurs in Jungle Foot , 2003. adorned with tropical foliage entwined with black-and-white vines or snakes . This strange object is indeed a lidded container the size and shape of a human foot . A hint of ghoulishness is not entirely undercut by the lush decoration nor by a historical reference : the form derives from ancient hot-water bottles , corked ceramic vessels produced in the shape of truncated feet . An arbitrary relationship between form and surface decoration in these examples gives way in a group of squarish platters to a nodding alliance between function and ornament . The series Fruit Loops I-IV , 2005 , sports vibrant images of peeled and peeling oranges , peaches , apples , figs and berries . The globular fruits dance in space , amid looping white lines deployed across the surface of each dish . Remarkably , these flourishes , ostensibly so spontaneous and free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background . Kiener 's masterly control induces the illusion of its opposite in an explosion of dizzying graphics and whirling spheres . Fruits go into orbit on the round chargers Big Fruit . Tumble Peach and Gravity , all 2005 , where apples and peaches acquire rings like Saturn and are joined by eight-pointed stars . Kiener organizes the decoration on these plates around the luminous white well , in which black spirals trace the movements of planetary fruits ; a black- or blue-hatched ground covers the broad , flat rim , suggesting a cosmic ambiance fora profusion of more spinning produce . In Gravity , the central peaches drop to one side of the well ; the inner rim is marked off at 10-degree intervals , as if mathematically to plot Kiener 's edible galaxy . The allusion to cartography continues in Peach in Space , 2005 , a square-footed , slab-built vessel whose exterior surface is inscribed with motifs from old maps . Inside , peaches and stars soar through space along with spiraling nebulae . Kiener dubs this piece a " fruit chaise " ; the stately form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also seems vaguely Chinese . Connie Kiener 's references are far-ranging and all-embracing . In two matte-glazed female busts , 2005-the charming highlight of this exhibition-she draws inspiration from the 15th-century terra-cotta sculptures of Luca della Robbia . Both figures , blue-complected with black smiles and stark white hair , turn gracefully to the right , as if engaged in animated relation . The winking Peek bears white spirals on her face and neck , and the planet Saturn on one temple . Her companion , named Cepheus , Cassiopeia , and Little Bear after the constellations mapped on her Renaissance skullcap , wears stars on hercheeksand rainbow-colored clouds at her throat . It'shard not to imagine in these heavenly muses , in all their extroverted and vivacious beauty , project ions of the artist'sown generous and abundantly creative personality . - SUE TAYLOR Photograph Connie Kiener 's works , both 2005 , are maiolica , handbuilt and painted with fluxed oxides .
